    "the discovery of large numbers of exoplanets by the _ kepler _ @xcite and _ corot _ @xcite satellites and by ground - based radial velocity surveys has stimulated enormous interest in determining the properties and radiative output of m dwarf host stars . the low mass and luminosity of m dwarfs makes these stars favorable targets for the discovery and characterization of exoplanets in their habitable zones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these exoplanets are potentially easier to discover because they have large orbital radial velocities and relatively high probabilities for transits as a consequence of their being much closer to their host stars than for solar - type stars . because m dwarf stars are much smaller and cooler than solar - type stars , their exoplanets occult a larger fraction of the stellar surface during transits with higher contrast between the exoplanet s faint absorption and emission spectra and the star s emission .",
    "unfortunately , variability of the stellar uv and optical flux due to rotation and starspots complicates the analysis of transit light curves for exoplanets of m dwarf stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and even the detection of habitable - zone exoplanets @xcite .",
    "@xcite extracted from the _ kepler _ data the mean number of earth - size ( 0.51.4 @xmath0 ) exoplanets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days , corresponding to orbital distances that place many exoplanets inside the habitable zones of m dwarfs .",
    "they found that the occurrence rate of such planets is @xmath1 per cool dwarf and predicted with 95% confidence that the nearest nontransiting earth - sized planet in its habitable zone is located within 5  pc of the sun .",
    "@xcite proposed that the occurrence rate for such planets is about a factor of three larger based on new calculations of the habitable zone boundaries , which will place the likely location of the nearest habitable planet even closer than 5  pc .",
    "these predictions are powerful arguments for studying m - dwarf stars , the closest and most numerous stars in the galaxy , whether or not they are presently known to harbor exoplanets . the upcoming _ transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) _ and the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ missions will play major roles in these studies .",
    "the many observational studies of the optical h@xmath2 and ca  ii h and k lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have until now provided the principle diagnostics for modeling the magnetically heated gas in the chromospheres of low - mass stars .",
    "the presence and strength of h@xmath2 emission is the commonly used indicator of activity levels in m stars and even brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "while the cores of the ca  ii lines increase monotonically with magnetic heating and provide an unambiguous measure of stellar activity , the h@xmath2 line behaves differently with increasing activity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and later modelers have predicted that with increasing chromospheric heating the h@xmath2 absorption line , which is very weak in the least active cool stars , first becomes a deeper absorption line and then fills - in to become an emission line .",
    "an accurate measure of the correlation of the fluxes or equivalent widths of the h@xmath2 and ca  ii lines requires simultaneous observations of the ca  ii and h@xmath2 lines , especially for the highly variable m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite obtained simultaneous high - resolution spectra of the ca  ii and h@xmath2 lines in m3  v stars .",
    "they observed a strong positive correlation of h@xmath2 and ca  ii emission in active stars but only a weak or nonexistent correlation for inactive and moderately active stars , because for a large range of ca  ii equivalent widths there is only a very small range of in h@xmath2 equivalent widths .",
    "this uncertain correlation for low activity stars , which has been noted by previous observers , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ) , highlights the need for spectral diagnostics of emission features that all have a monotonic dependence on activity and thus should be positively correlated .",
    "an example is the correlation of the chromospheric mg  ii emission lines ( similar to the ca  ii emission lines ) with x - ray emission for m stars as found by @xcite and others .",
    "x - ray observations of m - dwarf coronae show a nearly four orders - of- magnitude range in x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath3 ) between the least and most active m dwarfs and a correlation of l@xmath3 with x - ray spectral hardness and thus with higher coronal temperatures @xcite . @xcite has computed the total x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet flux for many stars , including gj  832 , from their observed x - ray spectra and developed scaling laws for this flux as a function of stellar age . during flares ,",
    "m dwarfs show both enhanced x - ray emission and hotter coronal plasma @xcite .",
    "searches for effects of exoplanets on the chromospheres and coronae of their host stars have provided some evidence for stellar - planetary interactions @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite found that additional heating in host star s chromosphere - corona transition regions ( hereafter called transition regions ) is correlated with the presence of a close - in exoplanet .",
    "high - resolution ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopy provides a wide range of diagnostics for computing semiempirical models of m dwarfs from the top of the photosphere through the chromosphere and into the corona .",
    "an excellent example of such a spectrum is the spectral atlas of the young dm1e star au mic obtained with the e140 m grating ( resolution @xmath4 ) of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. in this spectrum covering the wavelength region 117.5170  nm , @xcite identified 142 emission lines of 28 species extending from chromospheric neutrals ( e.g. , c  i and o  i ) and ions ( fe  ii and si  ii ) , through ions formed in the transition region between 20,000 k and 200,000 k ( c ii ",

    "n  v ) , and into the corona ( fe  xxi 135.4  nm line formed at @xmath5  k ) . with this rich group of emission lines , @xcite were able to construct an emission - measure distribution for the stellar chromosphere and transition region and to compute the electron density in the transition region from o iv intersystem line ratios .    the muscles ( measurements of the uv spectral characteristics of low mass exoplanetary systems ) observing program @xcite used both stis and the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on _ hst _ to obtain 115314  nm spectra of six weakly active m dwarfs hosting exoplanets , including gj  832 .",
    "these spectra have resolutions of 7.517 km  s@xmath6 in the 115179.5  nm region and 2.6 km  s@xmath6 in the near uv ( nuv , 170300  nm ) including the mg  ii h and k lines near 280  nm .",
    "an important result of this program is that while the nuv spectra of m dwarfs are a factor of @xmath7 times fainter than the sun at the habitable zone distance from the star , the far - uv ( fuv , 115170  nm ) spectra formed in the chromospheres of m dwarfs have fluxes comparable to or brighter than the sun @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed lyman - alpha ( ly-@xmath2 ) emission line corrected for interstellar absorption in m dwarf spectra has flux comparable to the entire rest of the 116305  nm spectrum @xcite .",
    "fluxes for these stars , including the reconstructed ly-@xmath2 flux , are included in the mast website .",
    "the muscles treasury survey extends the previous muscles pilot observing program to include quasi - simultaneous x - ray through near - ir observations of 7 m and 4 k dwarf host stars located within 20  pc of the sun .",
    "@xcite present an overview of the survey showing examples of the spectra and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) between 0.5  nm and 5.5@xmath8 m . @xcite compute reconstructions of the lyman-@xmath2 lines and use the reconstructed lyman-@xmath2 fluxes to estimate the unobservable extreme ultraviolet fluxes ( euv , 10 - 91.2  nm ) of the 11 stars . in the third of the initial survey papers ,",
    "@xcite describe the stitching together of the different data sets that constitute the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and compute photodissociation spectra of different molecules given the unattenuated seds of three host stars .",
    "the observed uv spectra of m dwarfs are essential input for the computation of photochemical models of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "the nuv stellar flux dissociates o@xmath9 , o@xmath10 , and other molecules , while the fuv flux dissociates h@xmath9o , co@xmath9 , ch@xmath11 , and other molecules . the stellar particle flux during a large flare can even deplete much of a planetary atmosphere s ozone @xcite .",
    "the very bright ly-@xmath2 line plays a major role in the photochemical processes .",
    "for example , photochemical models for the mini - neptune gj  436b @xcite , using the muscles data as input , show that the flux of ly-@xmath2 and other lines in the stellar fuv spectrum photodissociate h@xmath9o , co@xmath9 , and ch@xmath11 in the 10@xmath12 bar ( 10 n m@xmath13 ) and higher layers , producing atomic hydrogen and oxygen .",
    "euv radiation below 91.2",
    "nm ionizes hydrogen that then heats and inflates the outer atmospheres of close - in exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is important for the evolution of planetary atmospheres , because hydrogen is readily lost through hydrodynamic outflow and ion pickup by the magnetic stellar wind in distended atmospheres .",
    "this process may also explain the loss of the martian atmosphere @xcite . whether or not an exoplanet in the habitable zone can support life forms depends crucially on the stability and chemical composition of its atmosphere .",
    "the objective of this paper is to create the first complete physical model of a representative m dwarf , extending from its photosphere to its corona , that matches the observed spectrum and can predict the unobserved portions of the stellar spectrum . because the physical mechanisms that heat the chromospheres and coronae of late - type stars are not well understood , we use spectra over a broad range of wavelengths to test semi - empirical thermal structures of stellar chromospheres and coronae . by computing a physically consistent semi - empirical model",
    ", we can determine where in the atmosphere each spectral line and continuum is formed and note differences between where these features are formed in m dwarf models compared to solar models . based on a realistic atmospheric model describing these formation temperatures and heights , one can predict the input spectrum at the top of an exoplanet s atmosphere for earlier and later times in the host star s evolution by perturbing the stellar model to fit the emission - line fluxes ( e.g. , ca  ii , h@xmath2 , mg  ii ) observed in stars with different ages ( see * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the radiative output of host stars and its effects on habitability is essential for identifying the best targets for future studies of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "stellar models also permit us to compute the net cooling rates that theoretical models must eventually explain by predicting the required heating rates at each height and temperature .",
    "although there are extensive grids of theoretical models of cool star photospheres computed assuming convective - radiative equilibrium , for example the phoenix models and their revisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the marcs models @xcite , these models are inadequate for predicting stellar uv spectra .",
    "@xcite summarize the present state of photospheric models of cool stars and provides useful intercomparisons .",
    "existing photospheric models fail by orders of magnitude to predict the continuum and line flux below 250  nm emitted by the chromosphere and corona ( cf .",
    "* ) where nonthermal heating determines the thermal structure .",
    "non - lte line formation is also needed to explain the observed line profiles and fluxes .",
    "most observed m , k , and g stars , and even f types , have upper chromospheres and transition regions in which nonradiative heating , most likely by the conversion of magnetic energy to heat , raises temperatures far above the radiative - convective equilibrium predictions .",
    "this heating decreases the molecular abundances in a way that can be confused with a lower stellar metallicity .",
    "previous chromospheric models for m dwarf stars were usually computed to fit only the ca  ii , h@xmath2 , and na  i d lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an exception is the m - dwarf flare models computed by @xcite that fit the observed x - ray emission and transition - region lines in addition to the chromospheric lines .",
    "although emission in the cores of the ca  ii h and k lines indicates the presence of nonradiative heating in the upper chromosphere , these lines are insufficient for predicting the temperature structure above 7,000  k and thus most emission lines at wavelengths shorter than 300  nm . with a semi - empirical non - lte model , @xcite fitted the uv continuum and line spectrum of a sunspot , which may have a thermal structure similar to a relatively inactive m0  v star but with different gravity , very strong magnetic fields , and external illumination from the normal solar atmosphere . given these differences between a sunspot and an m dwarf and the importance of exoplanet studies , we compute a semi - empirical model for a representative m dwarf to fit an excellent panchromatic data set .",
    "we have selected for modeling gj  832 ( hd  204961 ) , a nearby m2  v @xcite red dwarf star located at a distance , @xmath14 pc @xcite .",
    "the age of this star is not well constrained observationally , but there are clues that the star is not young and perhaps as old as the sun .",
    "its measured rotational period , @xmath15  days , @xcite and h@xmath2 absorption rather than emission indicate a low level of activity .",
    "@xcite finds that stars with such rotational periods are likely members of a kinematically older population . @xcite",
    "finds that the mean kinematic age of m dwarfs observed in the mearth program with rotation periods in the range 1070 days is 3.1  gyr , but this result is uncertain due to the small number of stars in the group .",

    "we describe our approach and the resulting physical model . in sections  3 and 4 ,",
    "we compare the computed spectrum with observations , and in section  5 we compute the contribution functions for the important spectral lines and radiative losses as a function of wavelength and temperature as a guide to future theoretical heating models . in this section",
    ", we also discuss where spectral lines are formed in the m - dwarf model and the similarities and differences between the m - dwarf model and solar models .",
    "section  6 is our summary of this investigation and our conclusions .",
    "our approach is to model the temperature versus pressure distribution in the atmosphere of gj  832 based on the star s observed spectrum .",
    "this approach departs from the classical grids of stellar atmospheric models based on purely theoretical considerations of convective - radiative energy transport ( e.g. , atlas9 , marcs , and phoenix ) as described and intercompared by @xcite , but is similar to our approach used for computing semiempirical models of the solar atmosphere as described more fully in the next paragraph .",
    "we begin our calculations with an existing photospheric model for a star with similar spectral type and luminosity as gj  832 .",
    "we then substantially modify this thermal structure in the lower chromosphere and extend the temperature - pressure distribution from the temperature minimum to the corona to match the observed spectrum .",
    "given the complexity of our model atmosphere code needed to properly compute statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer in very many transitions , we assume a one - dimensional geometry .",
    "the first models of m dwarfs with a three - dimensional geometry are now being computed @xcite , but such models must make approximations in the radiative transfer physics and completeness that our model does not make .",
    "we compute stellar spectra in full non - lte using the solar - stellar radiation physical modeling ( ssrpm ) tools .",
    "these tools are an offspring of the solar radiation physical modeling ( srpm ) system developed in the course of five papers : paper  i @xcite , paper  ii @xcite , paper  iii @xcite , paper  iv @xcite , and paper  v @xcite .",
    "the srpm system computes one - dimensional solar atmosphere physical models ( distributions of temperature and density with pressure ) in full non - lte for each of the features observable on the solar disk and synthesizes from the models their emitted radiation .",
    "this modeling of the entire solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona produced very high - resolution spectra ( @xmath32 ) that we then tested against ground- and space - based spectra of the solar disk center at very high resolution to refine the models .",
    "the models also reproduce observations of the sun as a star , the solar spectral irradiance ( ssi ) , including the uv spectra observed by a number of spacecraft with good absolute flux calibration .",
    "the most recent models described in paper  v now accurately fit the solar 160400  nm irradiance that previous models had great difficulty fitting .",
    "the srpm tools , therefore , provide a very solid platform upon which we added to ssrpm a more extensive calculation of molecular formation in lte that includes molecular sequestration of elements and an improved list of the molecular lines that are most important for m - dwarfs , e.g. , tio , using data from @xcite .",
    "ssrpm calculations currently include 52 atoms and ions in full - nlte , in addition to h , h@xmath33 and h@xmath9 .",
    "the effectively thin approximation is used for an additional 198 highly ionized species . in total",
    ", we consider 18,538 levels and 435,986 spectral lines produced by atoms and ions .",
    "also included are the 20 most - abundant diatomic molecules and about 2 million molecular lines .",
    "as described in paper  v , we use new photodissociation cross - sections of the important species .",
    "radiation in the lower layers is computed in a plane - parallel approximation and the coronal radiation in a spherically symmetric approximation .",
    "the inclusion of optical data ( see section 3.1 ) allows us to obtain consistent models that constrain the photospheric structure and visible to ir wavelengths .",
    "the inclusion of uv emission lines originating in the chromosphere and transition region and coronal x - ray data allows us to create a self - consistent physical picture of the complete m dwarf atmosphere and spectrum from 0.1  nm to 300  microns .",
    "our calculations use an iterative linearization scheme to solve the nonlinear molecular lte equilibrium equations . for each general iteration in the present scheme ,",
    "the linearized simultaneous equations for molecule formation are solved in a subiteration block , and the full non - lte level populations and ionization states are solved for all neutrals and ions in a separate subiteration block .",
    "we normalize densities to the elemental abundances , which the present model assumes to be solar .",
    "these elemental abundances are listed in papers iii - v .",
    "we note that coronal abundances may differ from those lower in the atmosphere , the so - called fip effect .",
    "qualitatively , the star s atmospheric model is based on our experience in modeling the sun , but its physical values are very different .",
    "the conversion of the absolute measurement of the stellar spectrum flux at earth to the stellar average - disk intensity is carried out as in @xcite and depends on the accuracy of the stellar radius - to - distance ratio . since the distance to the star is known to better than 1% , the stellar radius dominates the uncertainty . the color index b  v = 1.52 @xcite points to a photospheric temperature @xmath34  k @xcite , while @xcite estimate @xmath35  k. in the present study , we assume the value of gravity at @xmath36 cm s@xmath13 , and radius , @xmath37 @xcite .    in the top panel of figure  1 , we compare the temperature versus gas pressure distribution for gj  832 ( model 3346 ) to that for the quiet sun inter - network model 1401 computed in paper  v. the models are quantitatively very different , but there are many qualitative similarities .",
    "both models have a photosphere and lower chromosphere in which temperature decreases outward with decreasing pressure . after reaching a minimum ,",
    "the temperature in the upper chromosphere rises rapidly beginning at a pressure @xmath38 dynes cm@xmath13 in the gj  832 model and @xmath40 dynes cm@xmath13 in the solar model , reaching a plateau with nearly constant temperature followed by a steep temperature rise in the transition region . like solar models ,",
    "model 3346 includes a geometrically thin transition region and a geometrically extended corona with a maximum temperature of approximately 2.7  mk ( see section 3.5 ) , which is significantly hotter than in models for the quiet - sun inter - network ( model 1311 ) but is similar to the solar corona in the bright plage model 1315 ( computed in paper  iv ) as shown in the bottom panel of figure  1 .",
    "we plot temperatures versus height for the transition region and coronal layers , since the pressure is nearly constant with height in these hot layers .",
    "the thermal structure of the atmospheric model of gj  832 is quantitatively very different from the sun , in particular model 3346 has a much cooler photosphere and chromosphere and higher pressure in the transition region than in the quiet sun model . as a result , the spectral features of gj  832 have different fluxes than the sun .",
    "the fuv spectra observed by _ hst _",
    "provide important constraints on the transition region that we discuss below .",
    "the detailed structure of the coronal portion of the gj  832 model is mostly theoretical and results from the very high thermal conductivity of coronal plasma .",
    "we use the total x - ray luminosity and the fe  xii 124.2  nm line to constrain the energy deposited in the corona and the energy balance calculations to determine the temperature structure of the corona of gj  832 .",
    "the photospheric and lower - chromospheric layers are derived from the visible spectrum and do not differ significantly from convective - radiative standard models , for example the phoenix models . however , extending the lower - chromosphere temperatures further out in the atmosphere completely fails to reproduce the uv emission lines of ionized species .",
    "the gj  832 model includes a steep temperature rise with decreasing pressure begining at @xmath38 dynes  cm@xmath13 .",
    "the pressure at which this chromospheric temperature rise occurs was first estimated by considering the triggering of the farley - buneman instability ( see * ? ? ? * ) and a magnetic field of about 100 gauss , which is representative of typical values for the magnetic field observed in the quiet sun .",
    "above the upper - chromospheric `` plateau '' with nearly constant temperature , there is a sharp rise to a coronal temperature @xmath41  k ( see section 3.5 ) with little change in pressure because of the small geometric thickness of the transition region . the steepness of the transition region is determined from matching the emission lines in the observed 100200  nm spectrum using the methods described in paper  ii with detailed calculations of the radiative losses by h and all other species ( see section  5.2 ) based on the recent atomic data from chianti 7.1 @xcite .",
    "we now compare the observed spectrum of gj  832 with the spectral synthesis of our model 3346 . for this",

    "the average disk intensity is a property of the star s atmosphere ( independent of stellar distance and radius ) and is converted to the physical flux measured at earth by a conversion factor that is the inverse of the stellar angular diameter , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the star s radius , and @xmath44 the distance from earth to the center of the star . using these values as mentioned above",

    "we analyze the optical spectra of gj  832 observed on sept 1 and 15 , 2012 with the reosc cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph on the 2.15  m jorge sahade telescope at the complejo astronomico el leoncito ( casleo ) in argentina .",
    "the reosc spectrum was flux calibrated by assuming that it is similar to that of a reference m1.5  v star ( gj  1 ) , which was calibrated according to the procedure developed by @xcite . the calibration procedure in that paper was estimated to have a 10% uncertainty but it is not well established how gj  832 may differ from gj  1 , implying that the absolute flux calibration uncertainty may be larger than 10% .",
    "the observed visual spectrum wavelengths have been converted to vacuum wavelengths for comparison with the model spectrum , which was smoothed to the resolution of the casleo reosc spectrograph of @xmath46 ( 2 pixels ) . @xcite",
    "published a radial velocity of 4.1 km  s@xmath6 for this star , but the moderate resolution of the casleo reosc spectrograph does not allow for a very accurate wavelength scale and we have not applied this small doppler shift to the observations .",
    "the observed and computed spectra between 400  nm and 675  nm are shown in figure 2 .",
    "this figure shows that the adopted set of parameters and physical model are broadly consistent with the observed intensities , although some minor differences occur .",
    "our experiments varying the photospheric temperature distribution show that the overall shape of the visible spectrum depends very little on the photospheric temperature gradient but much more on the temperatures at photospheric pressures .",
    "for solar - type stars , the layer at which optical depth is unity in the radial direction at the continuum wavelength of 500  nm is often used as a reference height .",
    "this reference height is not practical for m - type stars , because many spectral lines and the continuum can not be isolated in medium - resolution spectra such as those obtained with the casleo reosc .",
    "while optical depth unity ( @xmath47 ) is a representative height for the observed photospheric emission at solar disk center , @xmath48 corresponds to optical depth unity at the mean observing angle ( @xmath49 ) for an unresolved star and is more representative of the average disk intensity or emitted flux .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath48 as the approximate location for stellar emission .",
    "the observed pseudo - continuum is much lower than the theoretical real continuum because of the  jungle \" of overlaping molecular absorption lines , mostly tio lines , that can not be separated even in high - resolution spectra .",
    "the molecular line features that are discernable in the casleo spectrum correspond to exceptionally high transition probabilities , and are less well defined in the observed spectrum than in our computated spectrum , because we include only micro - turbulent line broadening and stellar rotation velocities .",
    "other velocities would smear the model spectrum but do not affect the conclusions of the present paper .",
    "for instance , in our high - resolution spectrum near 650  nm , the highest flux occurs at @xmath48 , where the pressure @xmath50 dyne cm@xmath13 and the temperature @xmath51  k. however , at the bottom of the nearby spectral lines , @xmath48 occurs higher in the atmosphere at @xmath52 dyne cm@xmath13 and @xmath53  k. in a calculation that excludes molecular lines but uses the same physical model , we find that the true continuum formed near @xmath48 occurs at @xmath54 dyne cm@xmath13 and @xmath55  k. however , the highest intensity level between spectral lines is significantly below the true continuum , which can not be observed in the visible spectrum even at extremely high spectral resolution because of line blending .",
    "figure 3 shows spectral lines from several atoms , ions , and tio molecules .",
    "particularly interesting are the visible lines that can display stellar activity , including ca  ii h and k and h@xmath2 .",
    "although relatively weak in less active m dwarfs , these lines in gj  832 indicate the presence of a nonradiatively heated upper chromosphere and are , therefore , valuable proxies for the uv flux and stellar activity cycles in m dwarfs .",
    "the upper left panel in figure 3 shows that the observed ca  ii lines are well matched by our model .",
    "the computed line centers of the ca  ii h and k lines form in the upper chromosphere ( see section 5.1 ) in the temperature range 4,00020,000  k and pressure range 110 dynes cm@xmath13 , which is similar to the formation temperature range in the quiet sun . in the gj  832 model ,",

    "our computed spectrum is based on the solar abundances listed in paper  v , and the relatively small differences between the computed and observed tio lines rule out a large difference between the solar and stellar abundances of ti and o. if the abundances of these elements in gj  832 were substantially smaller than solar , then the general slope of the spectra and the depth of the tio bands would not be as close to the observations as our computations show . also , significantly subsolar abundances would make it difficult to match the observed ca  ii , mg  ii , and many other lines .",
    "the inclusion of a chromosphere in our model leads to a good fit to many , but not all , of the observed spectral features of gj  832 .",

    "for example , reducing the spacing between the temperature - pressure grid points in the model where an emission line is formed decreases the total integrated intensity , while expanding the distance between points increases the intensity .",
    "this adjustment can be done locally with little effect on other nearby lines .",
    "the different thermal structures for the gj  832 and quiet sun models are responsible for the different formation conditions of important ions and spectral lines .",
    "for example , unlike the sun , the low temperatures in the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere of gj  832 result in ca being almost entirely neutral . as a result",
    ", the ca  ii h and k lines are formed only in a narrow region at higher temperatures in the upper chromosphere , and the line wings are narrower than in solar spectra . the ca  i absorption lines and tio bands are much stronger in gj  832 than in the sun because of the cool photosphere .",
    "the mg  ii h and k lines are also narrower than in the sun , because mg  ii is abundant where the temperature rises steeply in the upper chromosphere and the line cores are formed , but there is very little mg  ii in the cool lower chromosphere where the broad wings are formed in the sun .",
    "the si  iv , c  iv , and n  v lines are formed at 40,000170,000  k in the transition region of the gj  832 model , which is similar to their regions of formation in solar models .",
    "@xcite showed that the strong flux of chromospheric and transition region emission lines in the quiet - sun network and plage regions can be explained by semi - empirical models in which the sharp temperature rise in the transition region occurs deeper in the atmosphere where the pressure and density are higher .",
    "this is confirmed and extended to active regions as shown by models in @xcite and papers i  iv . if the temperature gradient in the transition region is the same , the effect of higher pressure at a given temperature is to increase the flux of optically thin lines such as c  iv proportional @xmath97 and to increase the flux of optically thick lines such as ca  ii h and k and mg  ii h and k by a smaller amount .",
    "grids of m - dwarf models built to fit the observed ca  ii and h-@xmath2 lines , including the models of @xcite and @xcite , also show that increasing ca  ii flux and the transition of h-@xmath2 from an absorption to an emission line naturally follow from thermal structures with increasing pressure in the upper chromosphere and transition region .    in our model 3346 for gj  832",
    ", the transition region pressure is about 4 times larger than model 1401 for the quiet sun ( figure  1 ) , implying that the transition - region lines on model 3346 should be 16 times brighter per unit area on the star .",
    "however , table  1 shows that after correction for the factor of 4 smaller surface area of gj  832 compared to the sun , the surface fluxes of transition region lines are about the same in both models , because the transition region of gj  832 has a much steeper temperature gradient that compensates for its higher pressure .",
    "the much cooler chromosphere of gj  832 compared to the quiet sun naturally explains why the relative emission of gj  832 compared to the quiet sun increases rapidly from the nuv to shorter wavelengths as shown in section  4 and figure  9 .    in model 3346 ,",
    "the transition region occurs at a pressure @xmath98 dynes  cm@xmath13 , which corresponds to a mass column density , @xmath99 , @xmath100 for the stellar gravity @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath102 is in the middle of the range for the grid of m1 dwarfs computed by @xcite and a factor of 2 smaller than for the quiet m - dwarf model ( qt3 ) computed by @xcite .",
    "the net radiative - loss rate of a plasma at a given temperature ( also called the total radiative - cooling loss ) is an essential input for estimating the energy balance in a wide variety of astrophysical environments , including quasars , galactic clusters , interstellar medium , and stellar atmospheres .",
    "the ingredients needed for calculating the net radiative loss as a function of plasma temperature , which we call the net radiative loss function ( nrlf ) , include the assumed abundances , ionization and recombination rates , excitation rates , the important continuum and line - emission processes , and a comprehensive catalog of oscillator strengths and collisional - excitation rates .",
    "early computations of the nrlf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) included bremsstrahlung , recombination radiation , and emission from a limited number of spectral lines , but these calculations assumed an optically thin plasma in all transitions and no molecules or dust .",
    "these functions showed peak emission at 13@xmath103  k with a steep dropoff at lower temperatures .",
    "subsequent calculations for solar models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed the importance of ca  ii and mg  ii in providing a peak in the nrlf at temperatures between 5,000 and 6,000  k. in their non - lte calculations for a solar model that included a large number of spectral lines from neutral and singly ionized atoms , @xcite found that the fe  ii lines contribute about half of the nrlf in the lower chromosphere . using the pandora code , @xcite and @xcite computed non - lte models for g and k dwarf stars to fit the ca  ii and h@xmath104 lines , and computed nrlfs in the lower and upper chromospheres .",
    "the nrlf computed in paper  ii for the quiet sun is compatible with those computed by @xcite , and the nrlfs for active regions on the sun are substantially larger .",
    "@xcite computed nrlfs for h  i , ca  ii , mg  ii , and fe  ii in their quiet - sun and sunspot models , and @xcite computed nrlfs for two m dwarfs , gj  867a and au  mic ( quiesecent and plage ) .",
    "figure 12 compares the nrlf for the gj  832 model with those for a quiet sun model ( 1401 ) and an active sun model ( 1404 ) .",
    "we assume that all spectral lines formed in the transition region and corona are optically thin , but for all other lines that may be optically thick we compute in non - lte the nrlf for transitions between two atomic levels , also called the net radiative bracket . at temperatures above 100,000  k ,",
    "the nrlfs of the two stars are the same , because the emission is from plasmas with the same abundances and all transitions are optically thin .",
    "below 100,000  k , the functions differ because fitting the gj  832 transition region line fluxes requires a much steeper thermal gradient in the the transition region than for the sun , leading to increased thermal diffusion of neutral h upward into the transition region and , therefore , stronger ly-@xmath2 emission ( cf .",
    "the thermal gradient in the gj  832 model is sufficiently steep that diffusion leads to h being 5% neutral at 66,000  k.    we also compare in figure  12 our nrlf with that computed by @xcite , which has often been used for studying the energy balence of hot astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the often used @xmath105 fit to the @xcite nrlf shown in figure  12 lies below the new function at @xmath106  k , but has a similar slope at temperatures above 100,000  k. the new atomic data and many more lines of highly ionized fe and other elements in the new models , and the diffusion of neutral h in the transition region , likely explain why the @xcite nrlf is low and should not be used at temperatures below @xmath107  k , because it diverges substantially from the atmospheric models .",
    "the figure also shows the nrlf computed by @xcite based on older atomic rates and a high abundance of oxygen .",
    "the difference with the newer solar and gj  832 models is mainly in the 20,000100,000  k temperature range where some lines are optically thick and thermal diffusion of neutral hydrogen is important .",
    "our selection of the best temperature - pressure distribution in the chromosphere was driven by the need to fit the observed ca  ii and mg  ii lines .",
    "these lines are formed in an overlaping temperature range with the main contribution for the ca  ii lines in the temperature plateau near 4500  k ( left panel of figure  10 ) and the mg  ii lines at slightly higher temperatures ( right panel of figure  10 ) .",
    "there is also a significant contribution to the formation of the ca  ii lines at temperatures down to 4000  k where the mg  i 285.2  nm line is formed .",
    "we found that in order to fit both the ca  ii and mg  ii lines , we needed a chromospheric thermal structure that produces too much flux in the mg  i line .",
    "we have explored whether the overly bright mg  i emission could be reduced with different chromospheric thermal structures , mg abundance , or continuum opacity without a solution .",
    "we conclude that the bright mg  i line likely results from inaccuracies in the atomic ionization and recombination rates .",
    "our model uses an approximate formula for these rates , but @xcite have recently computed new rates for inelastic electron and hydrogen atom collisional ionization of mg  i including charge transfer .",
    "unfortunately , they do not publish rates for mg  i ionization or recombination , and in the application of the mg  i rates to a grid of non - lte model atmospheres @xcite does not include these rates .",
    "the cooler upper chromosphere of gj  832 does not contribute as much to the ly-@xmath2 flux as the warmer upper chromosphere in solar models .",
    "for gj  832 the line is formed almost entirely in the transition region through the particle diffusion process that allows neutral h to exist at relatively high temperatures .",
    "this process also dominates the emission in the solar ly-@xmath2 line center , but the peaks and wings of the solar line are formed mainly in the upper chromosphere , which is not the case for gj832 because of the cooler temperatures in its upper chromosphere .",
    "another important difference between gj  832 and the sun is that the electron density in the cooler chromosphere of gj832 is much smaller than in the solar chromosphere . in the solar chromosphere , the heavy species are singly ionized everywhere , but in gj  832 they are mostly neutral in the lower chromosphere and then become singly ionized in the upper chromosphere due to the temperature increase and density decrease with height .",
    "thus , processes such as the farley - buneman instability can only occur in the lower chromosphere of gj  832 at low densities where the residual electrons that have a density of @xmath108 23@xmath109 @xmath82 can be heated to collisionally ionize the heavy abundant elements ( mg , si , fe ) , increasing the electron density to @xmath110 @xmath82 .",
    "in the case of the quiet sun , the electron density never decreases below @xmath111 @xmath82 and rises to about @xmath112 @xmath82 in the upper chromosphere .",
    "while the electron densities in gj  832 s chromosphere are about ten times smaller than in the sun , the higher pressure in gj  832 s lower transition region results in higher electron densities comparable to moderately active solar regions .",
    "this paper describes a complete physical model and synthetic spectrum for the m - dwarf star gj  832 computed to fit the observed uv and optical spectra and the x - ray flux .",
    "this is the first semi - empirical model of an m star including the photosphere , chromosphere , transition region , and corona that is computed in full non - lte using the solar - stellar radiation modeling tools previously employed for computing the most recent comprehensive solar - atmosphere models .",
    "the gj  832 model can serve as a prototype for computing an exoplanet s complete radiation environment , in particular the unobservable euv flux , when observations are not available because of the absence of suitable telescopes ( especially _ hst _ ) or our inability to observe a host star at earlier times in its evolution .",
    "we compute very high - resolution synthetic spectra ( @xmath113 ) from x - rays to the infrared for comparison with important diagnostics including the emission lines of ca  ii , mg  ii , ly@xmath2 , h@xmath2 c  ii - iv , si  iii - iv , and n  v. we list here our results and conclusions :    \\(1 ) our model 3346 for gj  832 differs quantitatively from the quiet sun model 1401 , but has qualitative similarities .",
    "the photosphere and lower chromosphere of the gj  832 model are much cooler than the quiet sun model at the same pressures with a minimum temperature of about 2600  k compared to about 3800  k for the quiet sun . however , the pressure corresponding to the minimum temperature is not very different for both models . above the temperature minimum ,",
    "both models have a steep temperature rise to a somewhat curved `` plateau '' near 4700  k for gj  832 and 6300  k for the quiet sun .",
    "\\(2 ) the spectral energy distribution of gj  832 is `` hotter '' than for the quiet sun . comparing the average disk intensity of gj  832 ( model 3346 ) to the quiet sun ( model 1401 )",
    ", we find that gj  832 is nearly @xmath114 times fainter at 200  nm , but comparable to the quiet sun in the 91130  nm spectral region and much brighter than the quiet sun in the x - ray and euv bands ( 091  nm ) .",
    "the excellent agreement of our computed euv luminosity with that obtained by two other techniques indicates that our model predicts reliable euv emission from gj  832 .",
    "\\(3 ) compared to the sun , gj  832 may be slightly metal deficient , but probably not as metal deficient as log[fe / h]=0.12 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the fit to the tio fluxes assuming solar abundances is consistent with metal abundances being close to solar .",
    "\\(4 ) we compute the temperature dependence of the net radiative - loss function ( nrlf ) for model 3346 using modern atomic oscillator strengths and collisional rates , non - lte radiative transfer , and a thermal structure for an m dwarf that provides the basis for computing future theoretical atmospheric models based on energy balance and heating rates . at temperatures above 100,000  k ,",
    "the nrlf for gj  832 is the same as for quiet and active solar models , because the abundances are the same in these models and all transitions are optically thin .",
    "the much steeper temperature gradient in the transition region of gj  832 results in strong diffusion of neutral h into the transition region and a much larger nrlf at 20,000100,000  k than for the quiet sun .",
    "while model 3346 does an excellent job of fitting the observed uv and optical emission lines and continua , our approach to semi - empirical modelling indicates the need for future work .",
    "the computed mg  i 285.2  nm shows the photospheric absorption more or less correctly but has a large central emission that is only very weak in the observed profile .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy is the result of incorrect atomic ionization / recombination rates that allow too much mg  i to be present in the upper chromophere .",
    "although small changes in the chromospheric thermal structure between 4000 and 5000  k may also be significant , our tests showed that with the current ionization / recombination rates such changes would lead to too large mg ii emissions before the mg i emission becomes small .",
    "the larger width of the shoulders of the computed lyman-@xmath2 emission line could result from the approximations used in the prd or from inaccurate atomic collisional and ionization data for the c  i continua that overlap the lyman-@xmath2 wings .",
    "we find that the inclusion of molecular absorption lines ( especially tio but also other diatomics ) is essential for fitting the wings of the na  i d and h@xmath2 lines . finally , we suggest that the opacity sources in the nuv , and particularly the h@xmath9 , need further study .    while our semi - empirical model for gj  832 incorporates state - of - the - art radiative transfer techniques and atomic and molecular rates , it does not attempt to describe atmospheric inhomogeneity or time variability . if the sun is a useful guide , then m dwarfs should have three - dimensional structures , active regions , starspots , flares , and other forms of spatial and temporal variability . such phenomena are indeed observed .",
    "inclusion of these effects will challenge future modelers , but the present model should be a useful basis for understanding the mean radiative output of m - dwarf stars that is of great interest for studying the habitability of exoplanets .",
    "we look forward to a new generation of models for stars cooler than the sun that will guide our understanding of stellar phenomena and physical processes and the radiation environment of their exoplanets .",
