    "thanks to a number of well - done solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments , we are now convinced that three known neutrinos have finite masses and one lepton flavor can convert to another @xcite . the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing at low energies is effectively described by a @xmath10 matrix @xmath5 , the so - called maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix @xcite , in the weak charged - current interactions : @xmath11 given the unitarity of @xmath5 , it can be parametrized in terms of three angles and three phases : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 which is physically relevant if massive neutrinos are the majorana particles . a global analysis of the available neutrino oscillation data @xcite points to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , much larger than the cabibbo angle @xmath19 in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark flavor mixing matrix @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the third mixing angle @xmath21 is expected to be smaller than @xmath22 , and its central value might be around @xmath23 @xcite as hinted by the preliminary t2k @xcite , minos @xcite and double chooz @xcite data .",
    "three cp - violating phases of @xmath5 remain unknown at this stage , but one of them ( i.e. , the dirac phase @xmath24 ) will be measured in the forthcoming long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .    the daya bay collaboration has recently made a breakthrough in the measurement of @xmath21 from the reactor @xmath0 oscillations @xcite .",
    "the best - fit ( @xmath2 range ) result is @xmath25 which is equivalent to @xmath26 or @xmath3 at the @xmath4 level . this very encouraging observation convinces us that the smallest neutrino mixing angle is not really small and the mnsp matrix @xmath5 is not strongly hierarchical .",
    "we are therefore motivated to study the underlying structure of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation .",
    "in fact , @xmath5 has been conjectured to have the following structure for a quite long time @xcite : @xmath27 in which the leading term @xmath6 is a constant matrix responsible for two larger mixing angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the next - to - leading term @xmath7 is a perturbation matrix responsible for both the smallest mixing angle @xmath21 and the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath24 .",
    "so far a lot of flavor symmetries have been brought into exercise to derive @xmath6 , while @xmath7 might originate from either an explicit flavor symmetry breaking scenario or some finite quantum corrections at a given energy scale or from a superhigh - energy scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "in view of the new and robust daya bay result for @xmath21 , we are immediately concerned about two burning issues of the day in the phenomenology of neutrino physics :    * if the essential structure of lepton flavor mixing is really revealed by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , can there be a natural pattern of @xmath6 accompanied by a natural perturbation matrix @xmath7 ?",
    "* if the main part of the mnsp matrix @xmath5 is not a constant mixing matrix , what is the most straightforward way to understand the salient features of lepton flavor mixing ?    in addition , we are curious about whether the structure of @xmath5 has an approximate @xmath8-@xmath9 permutation symmetry in modulus , whether leptonic cp violation is significant in neutrino oscillations , whether the other parametrizations of @xmath5 besides the one in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are useful for describing the properties of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation , and whether there is an interesting and suggestive expansion of @xmath5 as compared with the popular wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix @xmath20 @xcite , and so on .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer those easy questions and outline some possible ways to deal with those difficult ones as mentioned above . in section",
    "ii we describe two phenomenological strategies towards understanding the textures of lepton mass matrices and thus the structure of lepton flavor mixing : one of them can result in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and the other is expected to relate the mixing angles to the lepton mass ratios . in section iii",
    "we reexamine five typical patterns of @xmath6 ( the democratic @xcite , bimaximal @xcite , tri - bimaximal @xcite , golden - ratio @xcite and hexagonal @xcite mixing patterns ) by estimating their respective perturbation matrices with the help of the latest daya bay result for @xmath21 . except the democratic mixing pattern , we find that the other four patterns of @xmath6 suffer from a common problem : the viable perturbation matrix @xmath7 has to be adjusted in a more or less unnatural way to make one or two of the large mixing angles of @xmath6 slightly modified but its smallest ( vanishing ) angle significantly corrected .",
    "section iv is devoted to a brief discussion about the possible minimal perturbations to @xmath6 .",
    "we take three interesting examples to illustrate three simple approaches for this goal . in section",
    "v we point out the conditions under which the mnsp matrix @xmath5 may have an exact or approximate @xmath8-@xmath9 permutation symmetry in modulus .",
    "the strength of leptonic cp violation is calculated , and the language of leptonic unitarity triangles is reiterated to geometrically describe cp violation .",
    "section vi is devoted to a summary of nine topologically distinct parametrizations of @xmath5 and their respective features or merits , and section vii is devoted to a wolfenstein - like expansion of @xmath5 by taking @xmath6 to be the democratic mixing pattern . in section viii",
    "we first summarize the main points and results of this paper and then make some concluding remarks .",
    "the mnsp matrix @xmath5 actually describes a fundamental mismatch between the weak - interaction ( flavor ) and mass eigenstates of six leptons , or equivalently a mismatch between the diagonalizations of the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath30 and the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath31 in a given model , no matter whether the origin of neutrino masses is attributed to the seesaw mechanisms or not @xcite . assuming massive neutrinos to be the majorana particles , we may simply write out the leptonic mass terms as @xmath32 in which  @xmath33 \" stands for the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons , ",
    "@xmath34 \" denotes the charge - conjugated neutrino fields , and @xmath31 is symmetric . by means of the unitary matrices",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , one can diagonalize @xmath30 and @xmath31 through the transformations @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "then one arrives at the lepton mass terms in terms of the mass eigenstates : @xmath40 extending this basis transformation to the standard weak charged - current interactions , we immediately obtain eq . ( 1 ) in which the mnsp matrix @xmath5 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the above treatment is most general at a given energy scale ( e.g. , the electroweak scale ) , but it can still provide us with the following lessons :    * the structure of lepton flavor mixing is directly determined by the structures of @xmath35 and @xmath37 . since these two unitary matrices are used to diagonalize @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , their structures are governed by those of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whose eigenvalues are the physical lepton masses .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the dimensionless flavor mixing angles of @xmath5 should be certain kinds of functions whose variables include four independent mass ratios of three charged leptons and three neutrinos .",
    "namely , @xmath42 where the greek subscripts denote the charged leptons , the latin subscripts stand for the neutrinos , and  @xmath43 \" implies other possible dimensionless parameters originating from the lepton mass matrices .",
    "such an expectation has proved valid in the quark sector to explain why the relation @xmath44 works quite well and how the hierarchical structure of the ckm matrix @xmath20 is related to the strong hierarchies of quark masses ( i.e. , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) @xcite . as for the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing ,",
    "it is apparently difficult to link two large mixing angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 to two small mass ratios @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "hence one may consider to ascribe the largeness of @xmath28 and @xmath29 to a weak hierarchy of three neutrino masses , such as the conjecture @xmath49 @xcite or @xmath50 @xcite . * to establish a direct relation between @xmath51 and lepton mass ratios , one has to specify the textures of @xmath30 and @xmath31 by allowing some of their elements to vanish or to be vanishingly small .",
    "the most instructive example of this kind is the fritzsch ansatz @xcite , @xmath52 which is able to account for current neutrino oscillation data to an acceptable degree of accuracy ( e.g. , @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "another well - known and phenomenologically viable example is the two - zero textures of @xmath31 in the basis where @xmath30 is diagonal @xcite .",
    "note that the texture zeros of a fermion mass matrix dynamically mean that the corresponding matrix elements are sufficiently suppressed as compared with their neighboring counterparts , and they can be derived from a certain flavor symmetry in a given theoretical framework ( e.g. , with the help of the froggatt - nielson mechanism @xcite or discrete flavor symmetries @xcite ) .",
    "* we realize that the expectation in eq .",
    "( 7 ) is actually in conflict with the conjecture made in eq .",
    "( 4 ) . in other words ,",
    "the leading term of the mnsp matrix @xmath5 might be a constant matrix whose mixing angles are independent of the lepton mass ratios .",
    "the reason for this  conflict \" is rather simple : the assumed structures of lepton flavor mixing in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 7 ) correspond to two different structures of lepton mass matrices . as we have pointed out above",
    ", the direct dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath54 and @xmath55 is usually a direct consequence of the texture zeros of @xmath30 and ( or ) @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , a constant flavor mixing pattern @xmath6 may arise from some special textures of @xmath30 and ( or ) @xmath31 whose entries have certain kinds of linear correlations or equalities .",
    "for instance , the texture @xcite @xmath56 assures @xmath37 to be of the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix has no zero entries , but its nine elements satisfy the sum rules @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) .",
    "such correlative relations are similar to those texture zeros in the sense that both of them may reduce the number of free parameters associated with lepton mass matrices , making some predictions for the lepton flavor mixing angles technically possible .",
    "* it is well known that the special textures of @xmath30 and @xmath31 like that in eq .",
    "( 9 ) can easily be derived from certain discrete flavor symmetries ( e.g. , @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "that is why eq .",
    "( 4 ) formally summarizes a large class of lepton flavor mixing patterns in which the leading terms are constant matrices originating from some underlying flavor symmetries .",
    "the fact that @xmath21 is not very small poses a meaningful question to us today : can this mixing angle naturally be generated from the perturbation matrix @xmath7 ?",
    "the answer to this question is certainly dependent upon the form of @xmath6 in the flavor symmetry limit .",
    "we shall reexamine five typical patterns of @xmath6 in the subsequent section to get a feeling of the respective structures of @xmath7 which can be constrained by current experimental data on neutrino oscillations .    in short",
    ", one may try to understand the structure of the mnsp matrix @xmath5 by following two phenomenological strategies : one is to explore possible relations between the flavor mixing angles and the lepton mass ratios , and the other is to investigate possible constant patterns of lepton flavor mixing as the leading - order effects .",
    "we have seen that the former possibility essentially points to some vanishing ( or vanishingly small ) entries of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while the latter possibility apparently indicates some equalities or linear correlations among the entries of @xmath30 or @xmath31 . in both cases",
    "the underlying flavor symmetries play a crucial role in deriving the structures of lepton mass matrices which finally determine the structure of lepton flavor mixing .",
    "of course , how to pin down the correct flavor symmetries remains an open question .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we typically take @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as our inputs to fix the primary structure of the mnsp matrix @xmath5",
    ". then we arrive at @xmath65 it makes sense to compare a constant mixing pattern @xmath6 with the observed pattern of @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , such that one may estimate the structure of the corresponding perturbation matrix @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider five well - known patterns of @xmath6 for illustration .",
    "\\(1 ) the democratic mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath66 whose three mixing angles are @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the standard parametrization as given in eq . ( 2 ) . with the help of eq . ( 10 ) , we immediately obtain the form of @xmath70 as follows : @xmath71 one can see that the magnitude of each matrix element of @xmath7 is of @xmath72 , implying that the realistic pattern of @xmath5 might result from a democratic perturbation to @xmath6 ( i.e. , the nine entries of @xmath7 are all proportional to a common small parameter ) .",
    "we shall elaborate on this point in detail in section vii .",
    "\\(2 ) the bimaximal mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath73 which has @xmath67 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the standard parametrization . comparing eq .",
    "( 13 ) with eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we obtain the perturbation matrix @xmath76 we see that the matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath78 are highly suppressed .",
    "in other words , the initially maximal angle @xmath79 receives the minimal correction , which is much smaller than the one received by the initially minimal angle @xmath80 .",
    "such a situation seems to be more or less unnatural , at least from a point of view of model building .",
    "\\(3 ) the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath81 whose three mixing angles are @xmath82 , @xmath74 and @xmath83 in the standard parametrization . in a similar way we get the corresponding perturbation matrix",
    "@xmath84 it is quite obvious that @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath77 and @xmath87 are highly suppressed .",
    "so two initially large angles @xmath88 and @xmath79 are only slightly modified by the perturbation effects , but the initially minimal angle @xmath80 receives the maximal correction .",
    "\\(4 ) the golden - ratio mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath89 which has @xmath90 \\simeq 31.7^\\circ$ ] , @xmath68 and @xmath91 in the standard parametrization . in this case",
    "the perturbation matrix @xmath7 turns out to be @xmath92 similar to the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern , two initially large angles of the golden - ratio mixing pattern are only slightly corrected , but the initially minimal angle @xmath80 is significantly modified by the same perturbation .",
    "\\(5 ) the hexagonal mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath93 whose mixing angles are @xmath94 , @xmath68 and @xmath91 in the standard parametrization . in this case",
    "we obtain the perturbation matrix @xmath95 this result is quite analogous to the one obtained in eq .",
    "( 16 ) or eq .",
    "( 18 ) , simply because the patterns of @xmath6 in these three cases are quite similar .",
    "now let us summarize some useful lessons that we can directly learn from the above five typical examples of @xmath5 .    *",
    "to accommodate the unsuppressed value of @xmath21 in a generic flavor mixing structure @xmath96 , one has to choose a proper constant mixing pattern @xmath6 and adjust its perturbation matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the phenomenological criterion to do so is two - fold : on the one hand , @xmath6 should easily be derived from a certain flavor symmetry ; on the other hand , @xmath7 should have a natural structure which can easily be accounted for by either the flavor symmetry breaking or quantum corrections ( or both of them ) . *",
    "the common feature of the above five patterns of @xmath6 is apparently @xmath97 ( or equivalently , @xmath98 ) , implying that a relatively large perturbation is required for generating @xmath99 . in this case , the closer @xmath88 and @xmath79 are to the observed values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the more unnatural the structure of @xmath7 seems to be .",
    "the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern given in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , which is currently the most popular ansatz for model building based on certain flavor symmetries , suffers from this unnaturalness in particular @xcite . in this sense",
    "we argue that the democratic mixing pattern in eq . ( 11 ) might be more natural and deserve some more attention .",
    "* one may certainly consider some possible patterns of @xmath6 which can predict a finite value of @xmath80 in the vicinity of the experimental value of @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the three mixing angles of @xmath6 may receive comparably small corrections from the perturbation matrix @xmath7 , and thus the naturalness criterion can be satisfied .",
    "for example , the following two patterns of @xmath6 belong to this category and have been discussed in the literature : has been done in ref . @xcite .",
    "] one of them is the so - called correlative mixing pattern @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which predicts @xmath103 , @xmath75 and @xmath104 ; and the other is the tetra - maximal mixing pattern @xcite @xmath105 which predicts @xmath106 , @xmath75 and @xmath107 \\simeq 8.4^\\circ$ ] . of course , whether such constant mixing patterns can easily be derived from some underlying flavor symmetries remains an open question .",
    "in short , today s model building has to take the challenge caused by the reasonably large value of @xmath21 as observed in the daya bay experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning that the renormalization - group running effects or finite quantum corrections are almost impossible to generate @xmath63 from @xmath108 , unless the seesaw threshold effects or other extreme conditions are taken into account @xcite .",
    "one may therefore consider a pattern of @xmath6 with nonzero @xmath80 , such as the tetra - maximal mixing pattern @xcite or the correlative mixing pattern @xcite , as a starting point of view to calculate the radiative corrections before confronting it with current experimental data .",
    "we shall elaborate on this idea and examine its impact on leptonic cp violation elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that the perturbation matrix @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is in general a sum of all possible perturbations to the constant flavor mixing matrix @xmath6 . from the point of view of model building",
    ", it is helpful to single out a viable @xmath7 whose form is as simple as possible .",
    "to do so , let us reexpress eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the following manner : @xmath109 where @xmath110 holds , and it satisfies the condition @xmath111 as a result of the unitarity of @xmath5 itself .",
    "therefore , one may achieve a viable but minimal perturbation to @xmath6 by switching off @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) and adjusting @xmath114 ( or @xmath112 ) to its simplest form which is allowed by current experimental data .",
    "such a treatment is actually equivalent to multiply @xmath6 by a unitary perturbation matrix , which may more or less deviate from the identity matrix @xmath115 , from either its left - hand side or its right - hand side .",
    "the first example of this kind was given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the democratic mixing pattern , and its @xmath7 was mainly responsible for the generation of nonzero @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "here we concentrate on the typical patterns of @xmath6 discussed above and outline the main ideas of choosing the minimal perturbations to them .    *",
    "if @xmath6 predicts @xmath116 and @xmath98 together with @xmath117 ( the best - fit value based on current neutrino oscillation data @xcite ) , then the simplest way to generate a relatively large @xmath21 , keep @xmath118 unchanged and correct @xmath88 to a slightly smaller value is to choose a complex @xmath119 rotation matrix as the perturbation matrix : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a small angle to trigger the perturbation effect .",
    "the most striking example in this category is to take @xmath6 to be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern given in eq .",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath122 which predicts @xmath123 in the standard parametrization .",
    "note that the obtained correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath21 is especially interesting because it leads us to @xmath124 when @xmath125 , consistent with the present experimental data .",
    "if @xmath29 is allowed to slightly deviate from @xmath83 , then one may simply make the replacement @xmath126 in eq .",
    "* if @xmath6 predicts @xmath116 and @xmath98 together with @xmath127 , then the most economical way to generate a relatively large @xmath21 , keep @xmath128 unchanged and correct @xmath88 to a slightly larger value is to choose a complex @xmath129 rotation matrix as the perturbation matrix : @xmath130 taking @xmath6 to be the golden - ratio mixing pattern given in eq .",
    "( 17 ) for example , being the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern has been discussed in ref .",

    "we immediately arrive at @xmath132 whose predictions include @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 in the standard parametrization of @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath21 leads us to @xmath136 when @xmath125 , compatible with current experimental data .",
    "again , the replacement @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( 28 ) allows one to obtain a somewhat more flexible value of @xmath29 which may slightly deviate from @xmath83 . *",
    "if @xmath6 is quite far away from the realistic mnsp matrix @xmath5 , one has to consider a somewhat complicated perturbation matrix including two rotation angles . in the neglect of cp violation ,",
    "for instance , we may consider @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( for @xmath141 ) .",
    "however , we hope that the resulting structure of @xmath5 still allows us to obtain one or two predictions , in particular for the mixing angle @xmath21 .",
    "an example of this kind has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite by taking @xmath6 to be the democratic mixing pattern , and it predicts an interesting relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath29 in the standard parametrization : @xmath142 typically taking @xmath143 , we arrive at @xmath144 @xcite , which is in agreement with the daya bay result @xcite .",
    "it is easy to accommodate a cp - violating phase in @xmath145 @xcite , although its form might not be really minimal anymore .    for those constant flavor mixing patterns with @xmath146 from the very beginning , such as the correlative @xcite and tetra - maximal @xcite mixing scenarios given in eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , the similar minimal perturbations can be introduced in order to make the resulting mnsp matrix @xmath5 fit the experimental data to a much better degree of accuracy .",
    "it should be noted that the above discussions about possible patterns of @xmath7 ( or @xmath145 ) with respect to those of @xmath6 are purely phenomenological . from the point of view of model building , it is more meaningful to consider the textures of lepton mass matrices @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 can be obtained in the limit of certain flavor symmetries , and their special structures allow us to achieve a constant flavor mixing pattern @xmath6 .",
    "the perturbation matrices @xmath150 and @xmath151 play an important role in transforming @xmath6 into the realistic mnsp matrix @xmath5 , and thus their textures should be determined in a simple way and with a good reason .",

    "it is therefore possible , at least in principle , to fix the structure of @xmath151 with the help of a certain flavor symmetry and current experimental data .",
    "let us proceed to discuss two other flavor issues in the lepton sector after the successful measurement of the smallest mixing angle @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "it is well known that @xmath143 is favored by current atmospheric and accelerator neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",

    "the fact that @xmath21 is not strongly suppressed is certainly a good news to the experimental attempts towards a measurement of cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations is described by the jarlskog rephasing invariant @xcite @xmath177 which is proportional to the sine of the smallest flavor mixing angle @xmath21 . in the quark sector",
    "one has determined the corresponding jarlskog invariant @xmath178 @xcite and attributed its smallness to the strongly suppressed values of quark flavor mixing angles ( i.e. , @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 ) . in the lepton sector",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are large , and thus it is possible to achieve a relatively large value of @xmath182 if the cp - violating phase @xmath24 is not suppressed either . note that the maximal value of @xmath182 or @xmath183 can be obtained only when the mnsp ( or ckm ) matrix takes the special cabibbo texture @xmath184 @xcite or its equivalent form @xmath185 in the standard - parametrization phase convention : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the complex cube - root of unity ( i.e. , @xmath188 ) . therefore , @xmath189 or @xmath190 predicts @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , leading to the maximal cp violation @xmath194 .",

    ", they are possible to provide us with some novel points of view on the structure of lepton or quark flavor mixing . as stressed by feynman , ",
    "different views suggest different kinds of modifications which might be made \" and  a good theoretical physicist today might find it useful to have a wide range of physical viewpoints and mathematical expressions of the same theory available to him \" @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the mnsp matrix @xmath5 and make some comments on its nine different parametrizations listed in table i.    * pattern ( 1 ) was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is usually expressed in terms of the following notations : @xmath222 where @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in the leading - order approximation we have @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "there are two remarkable merits of this parametrization : 1 ) it is quite useful for model building if the neutrino mass spectrum has a normal hierarchy as the charged - lepton or quark mass spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath230 and @xmath231 have been conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and 2 ) it allows us to obtain impressively simple expressions of the one - loop renormalization - group equations for three flavor mixing angles and three cp - violating phases , much simpler than those obtained by using the standard parametrization in eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite .",
    "* pattern ( 2 ) is equivalent to the original kobayashi - maskawa parametrization @xcite .",
    "the structure of this pattern and those of patterns ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) have a common feature : the rotation matrix on the left - hand side of @xmath5 is @xmath232 , which is commutable with a diagonal matrix of the form @xmath233 .",
    "when a neutrino beam travels through a normal medium , the coherent forward scattering effect induced by the charged - current interactions of electron neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) with matter can just generate such an effective potential term @xcite .",
    "hence patterns ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) are more convenient to describe matter effects on neutrino oscillations . in particular , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that these three parametrizations of @xmath5 can all lead us to the exact and interesting toshev relation @xcite @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath236 denote the effective counterparts of @xmath29 and @xmath24 in matter .",
    "* pattern ( 3 ) is equivalent to the standard parametrization of @xmath5 given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite , although its phase convention is slightly different .",
    "this representation becomes most popular today because its three mixing angles ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath21 ) directly measure the effects of solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino oscillations ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 ) in the two - flavor approximation in vacuum .",
    "furthermore , the smallest mixing angle @xmath21 determines the smallest matrix element @xmath240 of the mnsp matrix @xmath5 in a way analogous to the standard parametrization of the ckm matrix @xmath20 , where the smallest element @xmath241 is controlled by the smallest mixing angle @xmath242 @xcite . hence in this parametrization the hierarchy of three mixing angles can almost truly reflect the overall hierarchy of the flavor mixing matrix , as we have discussed in sections iii , iv and v. * pattern ( 5 ) is structurally special in the sense that only the @xmath10 flavor mixing matrix @xmath5 can have this form around its  central element \" @xmath243 . as a result , two off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath5 in modulus",

    "in contrast , the ckm matrix @xmath20 is roughly symmetric in modulus about its @xmath252-@xmath253-@xmath254 axis .",
    "another unique feature of pattern ( 5 ) is that it assures three mixing angles to be comparably large and the ( dirac ) cp - violating phase to be nearly minimal ( in particular , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 for the quark sector ; and all the three mixing angles are around @xmath163 for the lepton sector with a much smaller dirac cp - violating phase @xcite ) . in this sense",
    "the approximate flavor mixing democracy and minimal cp violation have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite as an alternative point of view to look at the flavor puzzles of leptons and quarks .",
    "* some interest has also been paid to patterns ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 8) @xcite for two simple reasons : 1 ) none of the three flavor mixing angles is suppressed in each of them ; and 2 ) the cp - violating phase @xmath24 is strongly correlated with the mixing angles .",
    "this kind of strong parameter correlation might allow one to determine @xmath24 with fewer uncertainties from an experimental point of view , as compared with the relatively weak parameter correlation in patterns ( 3 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , where the value of @xmath21 is much smaller than those of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "generally speaking , however , patterns ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) seem to be somewhat less interesting than patterns ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) for the phenomenological studies of flavor physics .    for each of the nine parametrizations of the mnsp matrix @xmath5 , the explicit expression of the jarlskog invariant of leptonic cp violation",

    "( 12 ) indicates that its nine matrix elements are all of @xmath72 and thus can easily be described by a common small parameter .",
    "this observation reminds us of the well - known wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix @xmath20 , which was proposed soon after the smallest element @xmath241 was experimentally determined @xcite . such a parametrization has proved to be very useful because it clearly reveals the observed strong hierarchy in the quark flavor structure .",
