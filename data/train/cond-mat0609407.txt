    "spin related transport in magnetic hybrid systems has been studied intensively for last two decades and considerable progress has been achieved since the discovery of the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect@xcite in ferromagnet ( fm ) tunnelling junctions .",
    "this effect originates from the electrical resistances of these junction being dependent strongly on whether the moments of adjacent magnetic layers are parallel or antiparallel .",
    "the reason is that the tunnelling electrons are scattered more strongly in an antiparallel magnetic configuration than in a parallel configuration . as a result ,",
    "tunnelling junctions with moments in adjacent magnetic layers aligned antiparallelly have larger overall resistance than when the adjacent moments are aligned parallel , giving rise to tmr .",
    "the reverse effect of tmr is the spin transfer effect predicted independently by slonczewski@xcite and berger@xcite about a decade ago , in which a sufficiently large spin - polarized current injected from a normal metal ( nm ) into a fm layer can lead to magnetic moment reversal in the fm layer .",
    "spin transfer torque occurs in magnetic multilayers with noncollinear moments and is due to the non - conservation of spin current through the interface between nm and fm . due to the presence of noncollinearity ,",
    "the component of spin current transverse to the magnetization of the layers is not transmitted across the interfaces between nm and fm ; in other words , the discontinuity of spin current at the interface is the origin of the spin transfer effect that can result in magnetization precession or reversal.@xcite a large number of experiments have observed this spin transfer effect in magnetic multilayer structures,@xcite in which one of the fm layers is very thick and works as a polarizer of electric current with its fixed moment , and the moment of the thin fm layer may switch when a strong polarized electric current perpendicular to the layer plane flows through the layers .",
    "as the two magnetization directions in the fm / fm tunnelling junction are misaligned , an equilibrium spin current ( esc ) can flow in the junction without any bias,@xcite this phenomena is analogous to the josephson effect that the superconductor macroscopic phase difference between the two sides of a junction drives a supercurrent through the junction .",
    "the dissipationless esc will disappear if two moments in the adjacent fm layers are collinear , parallel or antiparallel .",
    "the existence of esc @xmath1 has been verified by many authors using the linear response theory,@xcite and explained as the result of the exchange coupling between two magnetic moments @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath0 , thus the magnetization phase difference between the fm electrodes induces esc in the fm junction as in the josephson effect . in the case of a thin barrier between fms or the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the behavior of esc is still unknown in the literature and worth studying .    in this paper",
    ", we study the esc flowing in a fm / fm junction with two fixed non - collinear magnetic moment using a simple quantum mechanical approach .",
    "the present work is motivated by two reasons .",
    "firstly , dissipationless spin current in last several years has drawn considerable interest and also incurred much debate , such as the controversies in the spin hall effect.@xcite the study of esc in fm / fm junctions may shed light on the spin current in spin - orbit coupled systems .",
    "secondly , the well - known result of esc @xmath0 in fm / fm junctions in the literature was obtained by using the linear response theory@xcite or heuristic derivation,@xcite thus an exact result of esc is in order . by extending mcmillan",
    "s green s function method which was originally employed to study the josephson effect in superconductor junction,@xcite we obtained an expression of esc in the fm / fm junction at equilibrium .",
    "esc is determined only by the andreev - type reflection amplitudes,@xcite which is similar to the josephson effect.@xcite it was also found that the exact esc expression is slightly different from the linear response result ; in other words , the high - order tunnelling processes are negligible and the linear response approximation has a wider range of application . when there is no barrier between the two fm electrodes , the esc was found to vanish indicating that esc is a pure quantum mechanical effect .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , a fm / fm junction model is given and the single electron green s function of the junction system is constructed from the scattering coefficients .",
    "an analytic expression of esc in the fm / fm junction is obtained in the third section and some discussions are presented .",
    "a conclusion is drawn in the last section .",
    "the fm / fm tunnelling junction is depicted schematically in fig .  1 and the layer between the fm electrodes can be either an insulator barrier or a normal metal .",
    "a simple free electron model is adopted to describe the fm / fm tunnelling junction and the hamiltonian reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective electron mass and assumed to be identical in all three regions , the two fm electrodes and the middle region .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath6 are the internal molecular fields of the left and right fm , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the pauli spin operator , and @xmath8 is the step function .",
    "the potential energy @xmath9 may take different values in different regions but remains constant in both fms . here",
    "the molecular fields @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( magnetization with energy unit ) are not collinear in our consideration and assumed to be fixed by an external magnetic field or other methods . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take the spin quantization axis of the system to be parallel to the magnetization of the left fm @xmath3 and the direction of @xmath6 of the right fm is described by the polar coordinate ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .    in a free electron model , the energy dispersions of the two fms",
    "can readily be solved and they are spin - dependent . in the left fm ,",
    "the eigenvalue is @xmath12 and the spinor is the eigenfunction of @xmath13 , and in the right fm , @xmath14 and the spin eigenfunctions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the different potential energy in the left(right ) fm , @xmath18 is the wavevector of electron and @xmath19 is the spin index .",
    "the spatial eigenfunctions are plane waves . due to spin splitting ,",
    "there are four incoming wave functions with their corresponding outgoing wave functions in the left and right fm , as schematically shown in fig .  2 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the wavefunctions of the minority spin and majority spin electron injecting from the left fm , respetively , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are those injecting from the right fm .",
    "for example , the wavefunction of the first type of scattering event @xmath20 is given by @xmath24 in this equation , @xmath25 is the spin - dependent wavevector along the @xmath26-direction in the left ( right ) fm electrode , @xmath27 is the single - electron energy which is conserved when electrons tunnel through the junction , @xmath28 is the wavevector parallel to the interface between the different regions and assumed to be conserved in the quantum tunnelling process .",
    "nevertheless , this is not a required condition for the following derivation .",
    "@xmath29 describes a minority - spin electron coming from the left fm lead and being scattered in the middle region ; the scattering coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the normal reflection , andreev - type reflection,@xcite transmission without branch crossing , and transmission with branch crossing,@xcite respectively .",
    "for the other @xmath34 scattering processes @xmath35 as well as their coefficients @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 as shown in fig .  2 have the same meaning",
    ". it is noted that we have omitted the parallel plane wave component @xmath40 in the above equation .",
    "when we use the continuity of the derivatives of wavefucntions at the interfaces to determine these coefficients ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) , the parallel momentum @xmath28 should be explicitly taken into account .    with four elementary scattering wavefunctions like those in eq .  2 above",
    ", the single - electron green s function of the junction system can be worked out by the mcmillan formula,@xcite which has been further developed by kashiwaya and tanaka.@xcite this formula has been used to treat the josephoson current in a superconductor junction and relate directly the super current to the andreev reflection amplitudes . the green s function @xmath45 is proportional to the direct product of the left - going wavefunctions ( processes @xmath46 , @xmath47 in fig .  2 ) and the right - going wavefunctions ( processes @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , where the hat ` @xmath54 ' denotes the conjugate process to the elementary scattering one shown in fig .  2 , and these conjugate",
    "scattering wavefunctions can be obtained by determining the hermitian conjugate of only the spinor part of the wavefunction not including the spatial part of the wavefunction . the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in four conjugate processes have the relations @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath11 is the azimuthal angle of the magnetization of the right fm . with these scattering wavefunctions of the elementary processes as well as their conjugate processes , the green s function",
    "is then constructed in a linear combination as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is implicitly a function of the parallel momentum @xmath66 .",
    "the prefactors @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) can be determined by the boundary conditions that the green s function fulfills , @xmath70 @xmath71 with these two equations , we can directly solve the prefactors @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eq .  3 , which are independent of the spatial position @xmath26 .",
    "after some direct algebra , they read @xmath72 where @xmath73 . in these solutions , we have employed some detailed balance conditions to facilitate our derivation , such as @xmath74 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath75 . substituting these prefactors into eq .  3",
    ", we obtained the green s function in the left fm electrode ( @xmath26,@xmath76 ) as @xmath77 the green s functions in other regions such as the middle region between the two fms can also be constructed in a similar manner according to eq .  3 with solutions given in eq .",
    "although the green s function is obtained here for the fm / fm junction , this method can also be applied to nonmagnetic junctions , and we believe the derivation procedure is universal in mesoscopic junction systems . when the retarded green s function of the studied system is worked out , we can in principle calculate the physical observables that we want . since we focus on an equilibrium tunnelling junction , the lesser green s function",
    "is easily obtained by the formula @xmath78f(e)\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the advanced green s function and @xmath80 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the lesser green s function is related to the spectral function of the electron and is very useful for calculating some physical quantities as shown later .",
    "in this section , we first present a general formula of the spin current in an fm and then utilize the green s function obtained in sec .",
    "ii to work out the esc in a fm / fm tunnelling junction .",
    "then as an example , we calculated esc of a simple fm / fm junction with a delta function insulator barrier between the two fm electrodes .    the local spin density @xmath81 at position @xmath82 and time @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a two - component wavefunction and @xmath86 with @xmath87 denoting the pauli spin matrices",
    ". taking the time - derivative of @xmath81 and using the schrodinger equation for a single fm , the continuity equation of spin current density is given by @xmath88 where the respective spin current density @xmath89 and the source term @xmath90 are @xmath91,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "{ \\mathbf{s}}=\\psi^{\\dagger}({\\boldsymbol\\sigma}\\times{\\mathbf{h}})\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the magnetization of the fm leads ( for example , @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath89 is the usual definition of spin current density and @xmath90 is referred to as the spin source term or spin torque that leads to spin rotation when the spin is not collinear with the magnetization @xmath92 .",
    "therefore this spin source term gives rise to a spin current flow which is not included in @xmath89 . using the lesser green s function in eq .",
    "8 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the quantum statistical average , the spin current density @xmath89 and the source term @xmath90 above in a steady state can be rewritten as @xmath95,\\ ] ] @xmath96,\\ ] ] where the trace is taken over the spin space . substituting the green s function given by eq .  7 and eq .  8 into the above equation",
    ", we obtain the esc expression in the fm / fm junction as    @xmath97 \\right\\}f(e),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 \\right\\}f(e)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath99    here the summation over @xmath66 includes the contribution of all transverse modes to the spin current , where @xmath66 is assumed to be conserved in the quantum tunnelling process . according to the above equation",
    ", the spin current density is determined by the andreev - type reflection coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath100 ; this result is very similar to the formula of the josephson current which is directly related to the andreev reflection coefficients.@xcite the spin current density in eq .  14 is exponentially @xmath26-dependent so that the integral over energy and transverse density of states will make it disappear in bulk fm not far away from interface .",
    "this phenomena is same as the spin transfer effect that the transmitted spin current is also dependent on position and will vanish after summing all possible transverse modes with different wavevectors .",
    "stiles and zagwill@xcite estimated the characteristic length of this spatial spin precession was about @xmath101 ( @xmath102 fermi wavevector ) because only the electrons near the fermi energy contribute to the electric current . for our case in eq .",
    "14 , all the band electrons contribute to esc so that @xmath89 is expected to decay much more quickly with distance from interface .",
    "apart from the spin current density @xmath89 , which can be calculated directly from its definition , additional spin current flow arises from the source term @xmath90 according to eq .",
    "according to the gaussian theorem , another spin current @xmath103 can be defined from this source term as    @xmath104 ) \\right\\}f(e)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath105 ) \\right\\}f(e).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath106-component of @xmath103 is zero .",
    "the @xmath26-dependent part of @xmath103 is just the @xmath107 in eq .",
    "14 , so that the sum of @xmath103 and @xmath108 is independent of @xmath26 and keep constant from the interface to the bulk fm , which does not disappear away from the interface ,    @xmath109    @xmath110    when a spin current @xmath108 enters the bulk fm , it will be absorbed by the lattice in fm because the magnetization @xmath92 rotates the spin and the sum of @xmath103 and @xmath108 therefore remains constant .",
    "as an example , we calculated a simple case of the fm / fm tunnelling junction , the potential energy in both fm is @xmath111 , and the insulator barrier is described by a delta barrier @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the strength of the barrier , the magnitudes of the magnetizations in two fm are equal @xmath114 . using simple quantum mechanics method , we obtain the andreev - type reflection amplitudes as @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 . substituting these quantities into eq .",
    "16 , the total esc is then given by @xmath118(k_{+}-k_{-})f(e ) \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_{l}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{h}}_{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are just the unit vectors of the magnetizations in",
    "the left and right fm .",
    "the esc depends on the directions of the two magnetizations not only through the cross product term @xmath121 but also on the quantity @xmath122 in eq .",
    "17 . in the finite barrier case ,",
    "we can neglect the @xmath123 term in @xmath122 so that eq .",
    "18 can reproduce the result obtained with the linear response theory , i.e. , the exchange coupling between two magnetization leading to esc . at the opposite limit , zero barrier between two fms @xmath124 , eq .",
    "18 indicates there is no esc flowing in the junction .",
    "this is the pure quantum mechanics effect , the reflected spin direction by a barrier rotates with respect to the incident spin direction and an imaginary part can appear in the quantity @xmath122 of eq .",
    "17 , which was regarded as@xcite one of reasons that spin current is not conserved at the interface when a polarized charge current flows through a nm / fm junction .",
    "for esc discussed here , the reflections by a barrier leading to an additional phase to the incident wavefunction which is necessary for the formation of esc in the noncollinear fm / fm junction .",
    "it is quite different from the josephson effect between two superconductors , in which a cooper pair carries supercurrent through the junction even with zero barrier .",
    "we have studied esc flowing in the noncollinear fm / fm tunnelling junction by extending mcmillan green s function method .",
    "the single - electron green s function of the junction can be constructed by the scattering coefficients , reflection and transmission amplitudes which can be directly calculated by simple quantum mechanics method . in the derived formula of spin current density",
    ", we found that the exact result of esc does not have a big difference from that obtained by the linear response theory , in other words , the high - ordered tunnelling process contribute little to esc .",
    "it was also found that when there is no barrier between two fms , the esc will disappear for the reflected spin state from a finite barrier has an additional phase which is crucial for the formation of esc .",
