    "transport coefficients extracted from the smf approach in the semi - classical limit have similar form as in the empirical nucleon exchange model  @xcite , but provide a more refined description of nucleon exchange mechanism . in the present work , we study nucleon exchange mechanism in fully quantal framework of the smf approach , also incorporating the memory effect in the diffusion process , and compare the results with the semi - classical approximation . in this investigation , for simplicity , we consider the central collisions of symmetric heavy - ions at energies below the fusion barrier . in section 2 , we present formal description of the nucleon diffusion in the quantal framework of the smf approach . in section 3",

    "the current density for each event obeys the continuity equation , @xmath12 in deep - inelastic collisions , since binary character of the system is maintained , a set of macroscopic variables can be defined with the help of the window between the colliding ions . in the central collisions of symmetric systems ,",
    "the collision geometry is rather simple , and the window is located at the origin of the center of mass frame and it is perpendicular to the collision direction . in this work , we do not differentiate between protons and neutrons , we consider only total nucleon diffusion .",
