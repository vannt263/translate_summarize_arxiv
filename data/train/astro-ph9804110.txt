    "the distance to the magellanic clouds is a problem of great astrophysical interest due to their role in the determination of extragalactic distances ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . despite the large amount of effort that has gone into the determination of these distances",
    ", they remain a matter of some controversy ( see @xcite , @xcite for thorough discussions ) .    the success of the hst cepheid key project , whose goal is the determination of h@xmath4 to an accuracy of 10% , depends critically on knowledge of the distance to the clouds , especially the lmc . based on the cepheid variable period - luminosity relation ( @xcite ) and the light echoes of sn1987a ( @xcite )",
    ", the key project has adopted a distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.50 @xmath2 0.10 ( 50 @xmath2 2 kpc ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "these determinations are in good agreement with recent derivations from rr lyrae variables , based on both ground - based , statistical parallax methods ( @xcite ) , and on the _ hipparcos_-calibrated distance scale ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lmc distance controversy is far from settled .",
    "a substantial fraction of recent techniques have yielded smaller values , typically in the range of ( m - m)@xmath3 @xmath1 18.30 @xmath2 0.10 .",
    "these include further analysis of the sn1987a light echoes ( @xcite ) and recalibration of the rr lyrae magnitude - metallicity relation ( @xcite ) .    if the distance to the lmc is uncertain , that of the smc is even more so ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "because of its smaller cepheid population and its large line - of - sight depth , distance determinations to the smc are in generally poorly constrained .",
    "we can only say with confidence that it lies some 0.30.6 mag beyond the lmc .",
    "the best cepheid distance to the smc is 18.94 @xmath2 0.04 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the large photometric sample of the ogle microlensing survey and its resulting high - quality color - magnitude diagrams of the clouds have permitted the development of the red clump of intermediate - age helium - burning stars as a `` standard candle '' for single - step distance determinations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key to this method has been the availability of accurate _ hipparcos _ parallaxes to calibrate the absolute magnitude of solar neighborhood red clump stars .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , @xcite ) show a solar - neighborhood red clump that has a very small dispersion in mean absolute i - band magnitude . because the red clump is the dominant post - main - sequence evolutionary phase for most stars , it makes a tempting target for the application of `` standard candle '' techniques for distance determinations .",
    "the red clump method was developed very thoroughly and applied to fields in the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) and m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies used the mean absolute magnitude of solar - neighborhood red clump stars , m@xmath5 = @xmath60.23 @xmath2 0.03 , obtained from a volume - limited sample of 228 red clump stars observed with _ hipparcos_. the red clump method is based on a well - populated , well - calibrated phase of stellar evolution ; in fact , it is possibly a more reliable distance indicator than many other methods that have been employed .    in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite extended the red clump method to the magellanic clouds . after taking careful account of the reddening distributions along cloud lines of sight",
    ", they find mean red clump magnitudes of i@xmath4(lmc ) = 17.85 @xmath2 0.03 , and i@xmath4(smc ) = 18.33 @xmath2 0.03 .",
    "using the solar neighborhood value m@xmath5 = @xmath60.23 @xmath2 0.03 , @xcite find distance moduli of ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.08 @xmath2 0.15 and ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.56 @xmath2 0.09 .",
    "these values are @xmath10.4 mag below the `` long '' distance scale preferred by the hst cepheid key project , and only marginally consistent with the `` short '' scale .",
    "@xcite applied the same technique to an independent large photometric survey of the lmc and obtained the virtually identical result ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.07 @xmath2 0.12 .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite note , the question becomes : why does such a robust method give results that are plainly inconsistent with other well - developed techniques ?",
    "we suspect that the effects of stellar evolution are responsible ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite very briefly discuss the possibility that population differences between the solar neighborhood and the clouds may be responsible for the @xmath10.4 mag distance discepancy they find .",
    "however , they deem these stellar population effects to be negligible for three main reasons ( @xcite , @xcite ) . first , the small observed dispersion in mean clump magnitude for each of the _ hipparcos _ , galactic bulge , m31 , and magellanic cloud fields ; second , the lack of a trend in i@xmath4 with ( v@xmath6i ) color in observed color - magnitude diagrams ; and third , the small variation in i@xmath4 between fields with known metallicity differences in m31 .",
    "each of these reasons is open to question . if , for example , the stellar populations differ _ from each other _ in their ages and metallicities , yet are homogeneous _ within each field _",
    ", then each red clump may be intrinsically narrow , yet differ significantly the solar neighborhood red clump .",
    "we found an extreme example of this effect in the very metal - poor , young dwarf irregular galaxy leo a ( @xcite ) , whose red clump must be @xmath10.4 mag more luminous than the _ hipparcos _ red clump in order to yield a distance that can be reconciled with the color - magnitude diagram of that galaxy",
    ". we will address the empirical constancy of m@xmath5 and the lack of variation in the m31 fields after considering the theoretical model predictions for red clump properties .    to explore the variation of the mean red clump magnitude m@xmath5 with age and metallicity",
    ", we examined the theoretical red clump models of @xcite ( sdw ) .",
    "these models give red clump star evolutionary tracks for masses from 0.741.70 m@xmath8 and metallicities z = 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.01 , and 0.02 .",
    "these models thus span the ranges of red clump formation epochs ( 110 gyr ) , and of galactic , lmc , and smc metallicities . in their analysis of smc star clusters ,",
    "@xcite note that newer models ( e.g. , @xcite ) yield essentially indistinguishable results .",
    "@xcite used these models , compared with star clusters in the clouds , to constrain the cloud distances .",
    "interestingly , they also preferred a short distance to the clouds .",
    "however , they do not exclude a long distance modulus because of the problems which , then as now , plague attempts to derive absolute red clump properties from theoretical models .",
    "the most vexing of these problems are the issue of mass - loss at the tip of the red giant branch , and the effects of convective overshooting from the cores of these stars ( c.f . the excellent discussion of mass loss in @xcite ) .",
    "in light of these difficulties , we take an empirical approach , in which the _ hipparcos _ calibration of m@xmath5 is used as our starting point , and deviations from m@xmath5(local ) are calculated using the relative shifts between the sdw models .",
    "we define the mean luminosity of the red clump , l@xmath4 , for each track by finding the points at which the model was evolving most slowly , i.e. , was most likely to be observed at . for each mass",
    ", we made a linear fit to the variation of l@xmath4 with z and examined the residuals . where the zeropoint offset was larger than the rms residual , we broke the fit into two pieces , one for the high - metallicity end and one for the low .",
    "we found the best single line fit to all masses is @xmath9m@xmath5 = ( 0.21 @xmath2 0.07 ) [ fe / h ] .",
    "we identified the _ hipparcos_-calibrated red clump m@xmath5 with the 1.2 m@xmath8 , z = 0.02 model clump .",
    "this is appropriate for a solar - metallicity population with roughly constant star formation rate over the past 10 gyr .",
    "we can then calculate the predicted m@xmath5 for arbitrary stellar population mixes given the mean ages and metallicities of those populations using the formula @xmath9m@xmath5 = -2.5 @xmath9l@xmath4 .",
    "because the effective temperatures under consideration do not change by much , we ignore the effects of a changing bolometric correction for now .",
    "note that this would be grossly incorrect for populations of still lower metallicity , such as leo a s , in which the clump is offset to the blue .",
    "first we correct each population for its metallicity by adding the @xmath9m@xmath10}$ ] determined from our linear fits .",
    "then we add the appropriate @xmath9m@xmath11 found from the luminosity differences between the various masses in the sdw grid of solar - metallicity models .",
    "table 1 gives our adopted values of @xmath9m@xmath5 for the masses and metallicities we have considered . for stars less massive than @xmath11.2 m@xmath8 , ( i.e. , populations older than @xmath145 gyr ) , the red clump magnitude is nearly independent of stellar mass , but can still vary significantly with metal abundance .    to apply these corrections to the _ hipparcos _ m@xmath5",
    ", it is necessary to assume a star formation history ( sfh ) for the target galaxy .",
    "for the lmc , we adopt the sfh of @xcite , in which 73% of the red clump is produced between 2 and 10 gyr ago with a mean metallicity z = 0.001 , and the remainder derives from a 12 gyr - old population with z = 0.008 . for this star formation history ,",
    "we derive @xmath9m@xmath5 = @xmath60.32 @xmath2 0.03 , yielding m@xmath5(lmc ) = @xmath60.55 @xmath2 0.04 .",
    "the color shift between a solar - metallicity clump and the lmc clump prompts us to revise m@xmath5(lmc ) downward by @xmath1 + 0.04 mag due to the increasing i - band bolometric correction ( bc@xmath12 ) for these slightly hotter stars , giving m@xmath5(lmc ) = @xmath60.51 @xmath2 0.04 . to test the sensitivity of this value to adopted sfh",
    ", we also examine a much more `` burstlike '' sfh ( @xcite ) , in which 44% of the red clump is made between 2 and 10 gyr in the past with z = 0.004 , and 56% of the clump is 12 gyr old at z = 0.008 . in this scenario ,",
    "m@xmath5(lmc ) = @xmath60.46 @xmath2 0.04 . the brighter red clump produced by a younger population",
    "is somewhat offset by the fainter red clump resulting from the higher metallicity in the vallanari _",
    "_ scenario . in light of recent hst observations ( @xcite ) , we consider the lmc to be more `` holtzman - like '' than `` vallenari - like '' , and adopt m@xmath5(lmc ) = @xmath60.51 @xmath2 0.04 .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the relatively small observed spread in red clump magnitude observed by @xcite , who point out that a bursting sfh would lead to a dispersion in clump properties .",
    "@xcite note the relatively blue color of the lmc red clump and conclude that its stars are metal - poor but not exceptionally young , in agreement with the @xcite and @xcite models .    for the smc ,",
    "the sfh is much less constrained .",
    "we consider two scenarios , one with a constant star formation rate from 110 gyr ago , and one in which all clump stars were produced in a burst 13 gyr in the past ( see @xcite ) .",
    "adopting the age - metallicity relation observed in smc star clusters ( @xcite ) , the mean smc metallicities we use are , respectively , [ fe / h ] = @xmath61 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath60.8 .",
    "the constant sfr scenario yields @xmath9m@xmath5 = @xmath60.26 @xmath2 0.04 and m@xmath5(smc ) = @xmath60.49 @xmath2 0.06 . for the burst scenario",
    "we obtain @xmath9m@xmath5 = @xmath60.36 @xmath2 0.04 and m@xmath5(smc ) = @xmath60.59 @xmath2 0.06 .",
    "these low - metallicity models require a change in bc@xmath12 of @xmath1 + 0.05 from the solar - metallicity models . at the present time , either sfh alternative seems plausible , and so we adopt a mean value of m@xmath5(smc ) = @xmath60.49 @xmath2 0.06 ( random ) @xmath2 0.05 ( systematic ) .    combining these new values of m@xmath5 with the values of i@xmath4 from @xcite , we find longer distances to the magellanic clouds : ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.36 @xmath2 0.05 ( random ) @xmath2 0.12 ( systematic ) ; ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.82 @xmath2 0.07 ( random ) @xmath2 0.13 ( systematic )",
    ".    how can we reconcile the variability of red clump properties with the apparent constancy of such stars as observed in the _ hipparcos _ and ogle color - magnitude diagrams ?",
    "apart from the homogeneity arguments given above , we can exploit the properties of the theoretical models and the behavior of real stellar populations for some plausible explanations .",
    "it is known from models ( e.g. , @xcite ) that metallicity influences the temperature as well as the luminosity of the red clump stars ; metal - poor stars are predicted to be bluer as well as brighter than their metal - rich counterparts .",
    "the observed lack of variation in i@xmath4 as a function of color has thus been interpreted as empirical proof that i@xmath4 does not vary appreciably with metallicity ( udalski , private communication ) .",
    "the differing behavior of bolometric luminosity and i - magnitude is presumed to arise from the increasing bc@xmath12 which must be applied to bluer stars .",
    "however , we find that bc@xmath12 changes by only @xmath1 + 0.05 mag between a solar - metallicity clump and an smc - metallicity clump",
    ". this counteracts some of the age and metallicity variation of m@xmath5 , especially for stars near 1 m@xmath8 , but can not negate it completely .",
    "the implicit assumption in the standard candle argument is that a range in metallicity is the major cause of a spread in red clump color .",
    "this is almost certainly untrue in a real stellar population , in which star formation has proceeded across a finite range in time .",
    "a real red clump contains stars of many masses ; each of these begins its helium - burning lifetime at a color determined in part by its individual mass - loss history , and evolves in color during its @xmath1310@xmath14 year lifetime .",
    "there is no unique mapping from the color - magnitude diagram to initial mass and metallicity .",
    "another effect that must be considered is the increase in model luminosities with both helium abundance y and core mass m@xmath15 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we considered models of constant y and m@xmath15 .",
    "however , in real stars , y increases with z , and m@xmath15 decreases with increasing y ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we might expect the mean clump luminosity to depend less strongly on metallicity than we have calculated here .",
    "the exact variations of m@xmath15 and y with z are subject to much uncertainty , but we estimate using the extensive tabulations of in @xcite that the effect is likely to be @xmath9m@xmath16 @xmath0 0.15 mag in most cases , and @xmath0 0.10 mag for the cases considered here .",
    "these pieces of stellar physics are of the correct magnitude and sign to erase the trend of m@xmath5 with [ fe / h ] for populations older than @xmath1 6 gyr , and reduce its effect for younger populations . because the _ hipparcos _ red clump ( @xcite ) , the galactic bulge clump ( @xcite ) and the m31 halo ( @xcite ) are all older populations , their approximately constant m@xmath5 is relatively unsurprising .",
    "the younger magellanic cloud populations , especially for the `` burst '' sfh scenarios retain their brighter clumps even assuming a high helium content and weak coupling between m@xmath15 and y , although @xmath9m@xmath5 is reduced somewhat .    following the relations from the calculations of @xcite and adopting dy / dz = 2.5 ( @xcite )",
    ", we estimate that the effects of variation in y and m@xmath15 with z can dim the lmc s red clump by 0.13 mag for the @xcite sfh .",
    "the age - metallicity tradeoff can be seen strongly in the smc . for our constant sfr model , its clump",
    "will be dimmed by 0.15 mag relative to the values above ; for the burst sfh , its clump dims by only 0.04 mag . with these numbers ,",
    "our revised distances become ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.24 @xmath2 0.17 , and ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.73 @xmath2 0.23 .",
    "however , we have taken the variations in y and m@xmath15 from disparate sources and these values merely serve to illustrate the potential countervailing effects of stellar physics on @xmath9m@xmath5 .",
    "more detailed modelling is required .",
    "our alternate red clump distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.36 @xmath2 0.17 is @xmath10.3 mag longer than that obtained under the assumption that the lmc red clump mimics the galaxy s .",
    "this is consistent with the `` long '' distance modulus of 18.50 @xmath2 0.10 adopted by the cepheid key project , and , contrary to @xcite and @xcite , in agreement with the most recent calibrations of the cepheid period - luminosity relation , which give ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.44 @xmath2 0.35 or 18.57 @xmath2 0.11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our value of 18.36 @xmath2 0.17 is also in agreement with the shorter distance from rr lyrae stars of ( m - m)@xmath3 = 18.28 @xmath2 0.13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "taking account of the stellar population of the smc pushes that galaxy slightly farther away as well , from ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.56 @xmath2 0.09 derived by @xcite , to ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.82 @xmath2 0.20 .",
    "the larger value is in good agreement with that from the cepheid period - luminosity relation , ( m - m)@xmath7 = 18.94 @xmath2 0.04 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed stellar physics of mass - loss , and the relations between z , y , and m@xmath15 introduce significant uncertainty into the determination of red clump absolute magnitudes , even in the i band .",
    "it is quite likely that these effects may work to bring the magellanic clouds to a distance more consistent with the `` short '' ( rr lyrae ) distance scale than the `` long '' ( cepheid ) scale .",
    "however , the red clump method does not require magellanic cloud distances as much as 15% smaller than commonly accepted .",
    "figure 1 shows the menagerie of recent lmc distance determinations with errorbars , and it can be seen that the red clump method gives results consistent with most of the other determinations .",
    "we conclude that the red clump is indeed an extremely useful distance indicator , as described by ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , like most stellar `` standard candles '' , its properties vary with the composition and age of the host galaxy , and the assumption that all red clumps are identical to the _ hipparcos _ red clump is probably incorrect . among populations dominated by stars older than @xmath16 gyr , the standard candle approximation should be valid to a high degree for m@xmath5 .",
    "for younger populations , m@xmath5 is probably brighter than m@xmath5(local ) , and the correction may amount to as much as several tenths of a magnitude .",
