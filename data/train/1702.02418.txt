    "<S> we mainly study two types of constraints ; @xmath65 both @xmath29 and @xmath30 lie in the same longitudinal plane of the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the desired superposed state is obtained with success probability , @xmath147 for @xmath148 , the success probability , @xmath149 , becomes double to that of the ordinary case . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 both the states belong to same transverse plane on the bloch sphere . in this case , we have @xmath150 , which implies @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> further , assuming both the states occupying diametrically opposite locations on the bloch sphere , the azimuthal angles of the two states may be considered as @xmath152 and @xmath153 . the total success probability obtained under these conditions is given by : @xmath154 in case both the states lie in the equatorial plane , i.e. arbitrary pair of orthogonal input states , the success probability is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> + _ conclusions : _ we experimentally create superposition of single - qubit states in the defined framework , covering all possible aspects , i.e. ( i ) creation of various single - qubit states and obtaining their superposition , ( ii ) superposition with arbitrary weights , and ( iii ) superposition of single - qubit states in the presence of assumed global phases . all the experimental results are obtained with good fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is also extended for the superposition of multiple states of a qudit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover special cases are discussed where one can obtain the desired superposed state with an enhanced value of the success probability . + _ acknowledgements : _ sd acknowledges the financial support by the institute of mathematical sciences chennai india , technische universitt dortmund germany , and support by the international collaborative research centre trr 160  coherent manipulation of interacting spin excitations in tailored semiconductors , \" funded by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft . </S>",
