    "in this letter , we present _ dark mediator dark matter _ ( dmdm ) to address two important gaps in the dm literature : exploring mediators with dark charge , and non - standard interaction topologies for scattering off nuclei . additional details and constraints will be explored in a companion paper  @xcite .    the existence of dark matter is firmly established by many astrophysical and cosmological observations  @xcite , but its mass and coupling to the standard model ( sm ) particles are still unknown . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are",
    "the most popular dm candidates since they arise in many theories beyond the sm , including supersymmetry , and may naturally give the correct relic abundance @xcite .",
    "however , improved experimental constraints  from collider searches , indirect detection and direct detection @xcite  begin to set tight limits ( with some conflicting signal hints ) on the standard wimp scenario with a contact interaction to quarks .",
    "this makes it necessary to look for a more complete set of dm models which are theoretically motivated while giving unique experimental signatures .",

    "right : the loop - induced @xmath6 process .",
    "the arrows indicate flow of dark charge .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "given its apparently long lifetime , most models of dm include some symmetry under which the dm candidate is charged to make it stable .",
    "an interesting possibility is that not only the dm candidate , but also the mediator connecting it to the visible sector is charged under this dark symmetry .",
    "such a ` dark mediator ' @xmath0 could only couple to the sm fields in pairs .    as a simple example , consider real or complex sm singlet scalars @xmath11 coupled to quarks , along with yukawa couplings to a dirac fermion dm candidate @xmath12 .",
    "the terms in the effective lagrangian relevant for direct detection are @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for @xmath15 mass terms , as well as the rest of the dark sector , which may be more complicated than this minimal setup .",
    "this interaction structure can be enforced by a @xmath16 symmetry . to emphasize the new features of this model for direct detection , we focus on the minimal case with a single mediator @xmath17 ( omitting the @xmath18-index ) . however , the actual number of dark mediators is important for interpreting indirect constraints @xcite .",
    "the leading order process for dm - nucleus scattering is @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",
    "however , an elastic scattering @xmath21 is always present at loop - level since it satisfies all possible symmetries , see fig .",
    "[ f.feynmandiagram ] . which of the two possibilities dominates direct detection depends on the size of the yukawa couplings @xmath22 as well as the dark mediator masses .",
    "previous modifications to wimp - nucleon scattering kinematics include the introduction of a mass splitting @xcite ; considering matrix elements @xmath23 with additional velocity- or momentum transfer suppressions ( for a complete list see e.g. @xcite ) , especially at low dm masses close to a gev @xcite ; light scalar or ` dark photon ' mediators ( see e.g. @xcite which give large enhancements at low nuclear recoil ) ; various forms of composite dark matter @xcite which may introduce additional form factors ; dm - nucleus scattering with intermediate bound states @xcite which enhances scattering in a narrow range of dm velocities ; and induced nucleon decay in asymmetric dark matter models @xcite . notably missing from this list",
    "are alternative process topologies for dm - nucleus scattering .",
    "this omission is remedied by the dmdm scenario .",
    "dmdm is uniquely favored to produce a detectable @xmath24 scattering signal at direct detection experiments .",
    "this is because it contains two important ingredients : ( 1 ) a light mediator with non - derivative couplings to enhance the cross section , compensating for the large suppression of emitting a relativistic particle in a non - relativistic scattering process , and ( 2 ) a scalar as opposed to a vector mediator , allowing it to carry dark charge ( without a derivative coupling ) .",
    "this imposes selection rules which make the @xmath25 process subleading in @xmath26 .",
    "these ingredients are difficult to consistently implement in other model constructions without violating constraints on light force carriers .",
    "the effect of strong differences between proton and neutron coupling to dm have been explored by @xcite . to concentrate on the kinematics",
    "we shall therefore assume the operator @xmath1 is flavor - blind in the quark mass basis . above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale",
    "this operator is realized as @xmath27 .",
    "it can be generated by integrating out heavy vector - like quarks which couple to the sm and @xmath0 @xcite , giving @xmath28 .",
    "this uv completion allows for large direct detection cross sections without being in conflict with collider bounds , but may be still probed at the 14 tev lhc .",

    "the dashed lines are spectra of standard wimp scattering ( via operator @xmath29 , with @xmath30 ) shown for comparison .",
    "dmdm spectra computed with ` madgraph5 ` @xcite and ` feynrules1.4 ` @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "we start by examining the novel @xmath3 regime of dmdm .",
    "the dm - nucleus collision is inelastic , not by introducing a new mass scale like a splitting , but by virtue of the process topology .",
    "the nuclear recoil spectrum is different compared to previously explored scenarios .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.partonleveldistribution ] , where we compare nuclear recoil spectra of standard wimps to dmdm for fixed velocity and different nucleus mass , _ before _ convolving with various form factors and the ambient dm speed distribution .",
    "the observable dmdm differential cross section is independent of @xmath10 for @xmath31 and can be well described by the function @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 , same as the wimp case for a given dm velocity .",
    "( we emphasize that this is a phenomenological description , the actual spectra were produced in madgraph , see section  [ s.directdetection ] . )",
    "the first factor comes from the light mediator propagator @xmath36 as well the integrated phase space of the escaping @xmath0 .",
    "the cross section suppression ( second factor ) is more pronounced as the dm becomes lighter or slower , and as the nucleus becomes heavier , both of which reduces @xmath37 .",
    "this is because massless @xmath0 emission carries away a more significant fraction of the total collision energy if the heavy particle momenta are smaller .",
    "the maximum kinematically allowed nuclear recoil is then less likely .",
    "when @xmath38 , the @xmath6 process will dominate direct detection for yukawa coupling @xmath26 above some threshold , or if @xmath39 . for the purpose of calculating the matrix element , the loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ f.feynmandiagram ] ( right ) is equivalent to the operator @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the momentum transfer in the scattering .",
    "effectively , this is identical to a standard wimp with a @xmath42 contact operator , but with an additional @xmath43 suppression in the cross section .",
    "this gives a similar phenomenology as a light mediator being exchanged at tree - level with derivative coupling .",
    "note that the relative importance of these two scattering processes is highly model dependent .",
    "for example , if @xmath44 the dominant scalar - dm coupling could be @xmath45 . in that case",
    ", the @xmath25 operator above is @xmath46 and can be suppressed without reducing the @xmath24 rate by taking @xmath47 .",
    "the scattering behavior of both the @xmath3 and @xmath6 regimes necessitates a re - interpretation of all dm direct detection bounds .",
    "we will do this below .",
    "direct detection experiments probe the ratio @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 scattering respectively . however , indirect constraints on dmdm from cosmology , stellar astrophysics and collider experiments are sensitive to the yukawa coupling and @xmath50 separately . in @xcite",
    "we conduct an extensive study of these bounds , including the first systematic exploration of constraints on the @xmath1 operator with light scalars @xmath0 . since these constraints ( in particular , eqns .",
    "[ e.nscoolingbound ] and [ e.thermalrelic ] below ) provide important context for our results on direct detection , we summarize the two most important results here .",
    "for details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the scalar mediator(s ) of dmdm are most stringently constrained from stellar astrophysics and cosmology :    * avoiding overclosure requires @xmath51 @xcite , so we take the heaviest stable @xmath0 to be essentially massless , making it a very subdominant dark matter component .",
    "this also satisfies structure formation , computed for light sterile neutrinos in @xcite .",
    "measurements by the planck satellite @xcite restrict the number of light degrees of freedom during big bang nucleosynthesis , enforcing the bound @xmath52 for real scalars . * the coupling of @xmath0 to the sm is most constrained from stellar astrophysics . for @xmath17 ,",
    "observational data on neutron star cooling essentially rules out any directly detectable dmdm model  @xcite .",
    "however , this bound is easily relaxed for @xmath44 if @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with a cosmologically unstable @xmath55 .",
    "the dominant interaction to the sm is assumed to be @xmath56 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath55 emission in the neutron star is boltzmann suppressed due to its core temperature of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 emission proceeds via a loop process .",
    "the bound on @xmath50 is then weakened to @xmath59 * in supernovae , emission of light invisible particles can truncate the neutrino burst @xcite .",
    "however , if these particles interact with the stellar medium more strongly than neutrinos they are trapped and do not leak away energy from the explosion .",
    "the temperature of supernovae @xmath60 is large enough to produce @xmath61 at tree - level in the above @xmath44 scenario , and the scattering cross section with nuclei is much larger than for neutrinos if @xmath62 .",
    "therefore this setup is compatible with supernovae constraints .",
    "* the lhc can set constraints on heavy dark vector quarks in a possible uv completion of dmdm .",
    "the cms @xmath63 di - jet + met search @xcite search sets a lower bound on the heavy quark to be @xmath64 tev .",
    "the physics of direct detection for this @xmath44 setup is identical to the minimal @xmath17 model .",
    "this is because the typical momentum transfer is @xmath65 , making the intermediate @xmath55 mediator massless for the purposes of direct detection .",
    "we are therefore justified in examining the direct detection phenomenology of the @xmath17 model in detail , applying the @xmath50 bound eqn .",
    "[ e.nscoolingbound ] and with the understanding that the full realization of dmdm requires a slightly non - minimal spectrum .",
    "the dark matter yukawa coupling is constrained from observations on large scale structure and ( under certain assumptions ) from cosmology :    * dark matter self - interaction bounds from bullet cluster observations constrain the dm yukawa coupling to be @xmath66 @xcite . *",
    "a thermal relic @xmath12 with @xmath67 requires @xmath68 if there is no significant @xmath69 term .",
    "this also satisfies the above self - interaction bounds .",
    "interestingly , the range of @xmath70 to mev that is relevant for its novel direct detection signal also makes dmdm a realization of self - interacting dm ( sidm ) @xcite . a yukawa interaction consistent with @xmath12 being a thermal relic",
    "can then help resolve the `` core / cusp '' and `` too - big - to - fail '' inconsistencies between dwarf galaxy observations and many - body simulations @xcite .",
