    ".      the velocity distribution of galaxies in clusters can provide information about the dynamical state of these systems .",
    "the normality of the radial velocity distribution is usually related to the dynamical equilibrium of a galaxy cluster .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb4 ]      before proceeding , we have to recognise some weaknesses of the two - body model .",
    "first of all , we should keep in mind that the two - body model does not consider the angular moment of the system , which is unlikely to be zero , since we have identified a velocity assymetry around the principal axis of the galaxy projected distribution , suggesting a rotating object .",
    "the reason this could be important to any dynamical analysis is that the corrected cluster mass can be reduced by @xmath320%-30% , on average , with respect to that uncorrected for rotation , as shown in @xcite .",
    "an additional weakness of the two - body model is not considering the distribution of matter inside each cluster .",
    "as clusters merge , their halos overlap and dark matter constraints should be taken into account , as shown in @xcite . finally , we also ignored the gravitational interaction of the infalling matter outside the cluster pair , which could affect the assumption that masses are constant since their formation time @xcite .",
    "all these points may modify the results presented in section 5.2 .",
    "it is not easy to distinguish the most reasonable two - body dynamical solution .",
    "several other factors must be considered to come up with a viable physical scenario . in the present work ,",
    "the solution that can be best assessed with the available data is @xmath80 , in which the close proximity of the clusters combined with the high colliding velocity would suggest that the system is about to coalesce , and should already be experiencing some dynamical interactions . if the system was at such evolutionary state , we would expect to see some disturbances in the velocity distributions , which has not been observed in this work : both clusters have gaussian velocity distributions ( see section 5.1 ) . in addition , applying the statistical tests described in section 4 , none of them indicates the presence of substructures in a3408 at the 95% c.l . ( with p - values @xmath81 0.221 ) , and only the ds test indicates substructures in a3407 at the 95% c.l .",
    "( p - value=0.016 ) .",
    "hence , these results ( taken separately ) are not indicating strong dynamical interactions in the pair .",
    "but cluster dynamics is also related to galaxy evolution .",
    "a cluster - cluster interaction may affect galaxy orbits , star formation rates , colors , and morphologies . from this perspective , there are some important differences between a3407 and a3408 .",
    "a3407 has a higher fraction of emission line galaxies , @xmath82 , in comparison to a3408 , @xmath83 .",
    "also , galaxies in a3408 are redder [ @xmath84 than in a3407 [ @xmath85 , with the ks test indicating color distributions significantly different between the clusters ( p - value@xmath86 ) . finally , while the bcg in a3407 has larger magnitude differences with respect to the second and third brightest galaxies [ @xmath87 , @xmath88 , in a3408 basically there is no magnitude difference between the three first ranked galaxies [ @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "these findings are further examples of the complexity of this pair .",
    "a3408 seems to contain more evolved galaxies with significant suppression of the star formation rate . at the same time",
    ", this cluster does not have an unquestioned bcg ( three galaxies could take the position ) .",
    "this is not in agreement with the central galaxy paradigm , which states that a bcg , with pronounced luminosity gap , should be at rest at the center of the cluster .",
    "the amplitude of the luminosity gap is a function of the formation epoch , the halo concentration , and the recent infall history of the cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this could be suggesting a dark matter halo less concentrated or disturbed in a3408 .",
