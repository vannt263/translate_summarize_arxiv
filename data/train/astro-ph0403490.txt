    "one of the main advantages of the spitzer space telescope ( formerly known as the space infrared infrared telescope facility ; sirtf , gallagher et al . 2003 ) is the possibility to make extragalactic surveys of large regions of the sky in a relatively short time covering wavelengths from the near - ir to the far - ir with the instruments irac ( fazio et al .",
    "1998 ) and mips ( rieke et al . 1996 ) .",
    "compared to _",
    "s predecessors ( e.g. iras , soifer et  al .",
    "1983 , and iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) , there are improvements in the detectors ( number of pixels and better responsivity ) , the collecting area of the primary mirror ( 85 cm diameter ) , and sun - earth - moon avoidance constraints due _ spitzer _ s heliocentric orbit . _",
    "spitzer _  can also make observations simultaneously in multiple bands ( with irac3.6 and 4.5 or 5.8 and 8 @xmath10 m ; with mips24 , 70 and 160 @xmath10 m ) .",
    "many extragalactic surveys are already scheduled with _",
    "spitzer _ as legacy programs ( swire , lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ; goods , dickinson & giavalisco 2001 ) or as observations by the instrument teams ( wide , deep and ultra - deep _ spitzer _ surveys which will cover regions like the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey , the groth strip , lockman hole , xmm - deep and so on , see e.g.  dole et al .",
    "the first look survey utilizes 112 hours of director s discretionary time on _ spitzer _  and includes extragalactic , galactic , and ecliptic components .",
    "these data will be available to all observers when the spitzer science archive opens in may , 2004 .",
    "the purpose of the fls is to characterize the mid - infrared sky at previously unexplored depths and make these data rapidly available to the astronomical community . the extragalactic component is comprised of a 4 square degree survey with irac and mips near the north ecliptic pole centered at j1718 + 5930 .",
    "these observations were executed on 2003 december 1 - 11 .    to fully exploit the _ spitzer _",
    "fls data we have obtained ancillary surveys at optical ( this paper ) and radio wavelengths ( condon et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "given the modest spatial resolution of the _ spitzer _ imagers ( the point spread function is large , especially in the mid and far - ir , e.g. 5.7 arcseconds full width at half maximum , fwhm , for the 24 @xmath10 m channel ) , the first problem to solve for the infrared sources detected by _ spitzer _ will be to associate these sources with an optical counterpart , when possible .",
    "this will then allow the higher spatial resolution of the available optical images to assist with the source classification ( e.g. as stars , galaxies or qso ) and enable targeting of subsets of the sources for spectroscopy with optical or near - ir spectrographs . since many of the infrared sources that will be detected by _",
    "spitzer _ will be dust - obscured galaxies with faint optical counterparts , the complementary optical imaging must be relatively deep .",
    "although a deep multi - wavelength optical survey would be more useful , allowing one to compute photometric redshifts ( e.g. the noao deep wide - field survey , jannuzi and dey 1999 , brown et al .",
    "2003 ) , the task of deeply covering a large region of sky in a homogeneous manner is quite time - consuming .",
    "therefore , for the initial optical ancillary survey we chose to observe the entire field in the r - band .",
    "noao provided 4 nights of director s discretionary time on the kpno 4 m in may , 2000 , for this survey .",
    "we have limited multi - wavelength optical observations to the central portion of the fls field .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey included the fls field in their early release observations ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) and mosaics and catalogs for the region are also now available ( hogg et  al . 2004 ) .    in this paper , we present the r - band optical observations made with the mosaic-1 camera on the mayall 4 m telescope of kitt peak national observatory .",
    "centered on the main fls field , a region 9.4 square degrees in area was imaged .",
    "in addition , 2.3 square degrees covering the elais - n1 field was also observed .",
    "although originally the elais - n1 field was planned to be part of the fls program , the fls observations of the elais - n1 field have now been revised to a very deep 10@xmath910 pointing to evaluate the confusion limits of the mips instrument .",
    "the remainder of the elais - n1 field will now be imaged as part of a larger survey in this region , a portion of the swire _ spitzer _",
    "legacy survey ( lonsdale et al . , 2003 ) .",

    "the optical observations of the fls region ( centered at @xmath0 @xmath11 , j2000 ) and of the elais - n1 region ( centered at @xmath4 @xmath12 , j2000 , see oliver et al .",
    "2000 ) were carried out using the mosaic-1 camera on the mayall 4 m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the mosaic-1 camera is comprised of eight thinned , back - illuminated site 2048 @xmath9 4098 ccds with a projected pixel size of 0.258 arcsec ( muller et al .",
    "the 8 ccds are physically separated by gaps with widths of approximately 14 and 15.5 arcsec along the right ascension and declination directions , respectively .",
    "the full field of view of the camera is therefore 36 @xmath9 36 square arcmin , with a filling factor of 97% .",
    "observations were performed using the harris set kron - cousins r - band filter whose main features are summarized in table  [ tbl : filter ] .",
    "the transmission curve of the filter is shown in figure  [ fig : transcurve ] together with the resulting modifications that would be introduced by the corrector and camera optics , the ccd quantum efficiency , and atmospheric extinction .        for organizational purposes we chose to divide the proposed fls survey region into 30 subfields each roughly the size of an individual mosaic-1 pointing .",
    "the coordinates of these subfields are listed in table  [ tbl : coordinates ] . during our observing run",
    "we were able to complete observations for 26 of these subfields .",
    "we similarly divided the elais - n1 field into 12 subfields , but only completed observations for 5 of these fields .",
    "each subfield was observed for a minimum of three 10 min exposures . in practice , some images were not suitable ( poor seeing , flat fielding problem , or some other defect ) and were not included in the final coadded or `` stacked '' images we are providing to the community .",

    "4 the number of exposures which were obtained and included in the coadded or `` stacked '' images . in order to provide some coverage in the regions of the sky that would fall in the inter - chip gaps ,",
    "the positions of successive exposures of a given field were offset on order of an arcminute relative to each other .",
    "in general the first exposure was at the nominal ( tabulated ) position , the second shifted by @xmath13 in @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 , and the third with a shift of @xmath17 and 62.3@xmath18 in @xmath14 and @xmath16 . in a few cases an additional position with @xmath19 and @xmath20 has been observed .",
    "for a few fields , observations have been repeated due to the bad seeing or pointing errors .",
    "the kpno imaging observations were made on 2000 may 4 - 7,9 ut .",
    "a log of the observations is summarized in table  [ tbl : log ] , which lists for each group of observations : the date of the observations ( col .",

    ", the pointing of the telescope was incorrectly initialized , resulting in approximately a @xmath21 error in the pointing for some fields .",
    "these are noted in the observing log .",
    "since the @xmath21 offset did not map exactly on to our subfield grid , we chose to make stacked or combined images for several of the subfields .",

    "the processing of the raw mosaic-1 exposures followed the steps outlined in version 7.01 of `` the noao deep wide - field survey mosaic data reductions guide '' and discussed by jannuzi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the bulk of the software used to process the images and generate combined images for each subfield from the individual 10 minute exposures is described by valdes ( 2002 ) and contained as part of the mscred software package ( v4.7 ) , which is part of iraf .",
    "the image quality of the final stacks is variable , as was the seeing during the run .",
    "users of the images should be aware that the detailed shape of the point spread function in a given image stack could be variable across the field , not only because of residual distortions in the camera , but because a given position in the field might be the average of different input images , each with their own point spread function .",
    "no attempt was made to match the psfs of the individual images before combining the images .    in a survey area",
    "this large there will be fields with very bright stars .",
    "this can cause some regions of the survey area to be impacted by scattered light from these stars .",
    "some effort was made to minimize this impact during the observations ( by shifting pointings ) and reduction of the images ( through masking of affected regions in some images to allow unaffected images to be the sole contribution to the stacked image ) , but users of the images should be aware that some scattered light will have made it into some of the stacks .",
    "an example of a subfield with significant scattered light is fls_15 .",
    "flat fielding of the images was accomplished through the application of calibration files generated first from observations of a flat - field screen inside the dome at the 4 m and from a `` super - sky '' flat constructed by combining the majority of the fls and elais - n1 images ( with objects masked and rejected ) .",
    "the result is generally excellent flat fielding of the sky ( with some fields with slightly different sky color , due to moon light or twilight worse ) , but users should be aware that there are likely to be some color - dependent variations between and within the 8 ccds , meaning that uncorrected errors in the photometry of a given object , attributable to the flat fielding correction not being derived from a source with color matched to the color of that object , on the order of 1 to 3 percent could still be present in the data even though the sky is generally quite `` flat '' .",
    "the astrometric calibration of the mosaic-1 images is accomplished in two steps .",
    "first , the high - order distortions in the field , which will in general be common to all our exposures ( those anticipated to be the result of the optics and/or ccd placement and as a result stable over the course of an observing run or season ) are calibrated using observations of an astrometric standard field .",
    "these distortions can be wavelength dependent , so the calibration is made for the specific filter being used .",
    "these images are analyzed to produce a default correction for each of the ccds .",
    "low - order corrections ( translational offset , small rotation , and/or scale adjustments needed to compensate for pointing errors , instrument mounting variations between runs , and atmospheric effects ) are corrected on an exposure by exposure basis using the many catalog objects in each exposure , the previously mentioned knowledge of the high - order distortions as a function of ccd position , and the software _ msccmatch _ in iraf .",
    "the astrometric calibration has been performed using the reduction protocol developed for the reduction of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) data which assumes as astrometric reference the usno - a2.0 catalog ( monet et  al .",
    "1998 ) . adopting the gsc  ii catalog , which became available after the development of the ndwfs reduction protocol ,",
    "might improve the quality of the astrometric solutions and this might be done if a rereduction of the data set is done in the future . as we discuss further below , the anticipated improvement would be slight . for the images described in this paper our solutions for the mapping of the mosaic-1 pixels into a world coordinate frame had an rms scatter of between 0.3 to 0.45 arcseconds , depending on the particular field .",
    "after each image was provided with an improved astrometric calibration , it was tangent - plane projected with respect to the fls and elais - n1 field center positions listed above .",
    "following projection , the individual exposures ( typically three for a given region of the sky ) could be combined into a final , stacked , image .",
    "these are the images currently being made available in the _ spitzer _ and noao archives .    during the final stages of the data reduction ,",
    "when the individual images were being combined to make the final image stacks , it was determined that there was an error in the high - order astrometric correction file for the harris r - band filter affecting the adjacent edges of ccds 7 and 8 in the mosaic-1 camera .",
    "the original solutions for the high order distortion terms were determined on a chip by chip basis with no requirement that the solution be continuous across the entire field . in general , while this requirement was not imposed , it was met by the solutions provided by noao . however , for the r - band the solution available at the time we were reducing the data was discontinuous at the ccd7 and ccd8 boundary . since our image stacks are made from the combination of three or more images that are offset by 30 arcseconds to an arcminute from each other ,",
    "this difference between the solutions for the two ccds can result in a mis - mapping , into ra and dec space , of a region of the sky imaged first on ccd7 and then on ccd8 .",
    "the error is small , and introduces at most an additional @xmath22 uncertainty to the positions of sources in the affected region ( which is located in the se corner of each field , about 25% of the field up from the southern edge ) , but will result in a degradation of the psf for objects affected in this region .",
    "the size of the affected region in each subfield is approximately 8.5@xmath18 east - west and 2.5@xmath18 north - south , or a bit less than 2% of the surveyed area .",
    "[ b ! ]        since not all the subfields were observed during nights with photometric conditions ( see table  [ tbl : log ] ) , we derived a coherent photometric system in two steps",
    ". first , we computed the relative photometric zero - points between the different stacked images of the subfields .",
    "since each subfield overlaps its neighbor by approximately two arcminutes , we can estimate the extinction difference between them using a set of common sources .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of zero - point that , by definition , includes the effects of airmass and extinction . because each frame has multiple overlaps ,",
    "the number of frame - to - frame magnitude differences is over - determined with respect to the number of frames .",
    "therefore , one can derive the relative zero - point for each frame simultaneously using a least squares estimator .",
    "we extracted the sources from each subfield using as a first guess for the zero - point that we computed for a central subfield ( # 18 and # 5 for the fls and elais - n1 fields , respectively ) . for each overlap between contiguous fields",
    ", we selected the pairs of stars with magnitude @xmath23 and computed the median of the difference in magnitudes by using a 3@xmath8 clipping procedure .",
    "the magnitudes considered were the auto magnitudes ( mag_auto ) from sextractor , which are fairly robust with respect to seeing variations . to estimate the relative zero - points in the sense of the least squares",
    ", we minimized the sum : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the variation with respect to the initial guess of the zero - point of the subfield @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the median of the differences of magnitude for the set of the @xmath28 source pairs in the overlapping region between the subfields @xmath26 and @xmath29 . solving the linear system obtained by imposing that the derivatives of ( 1 ) with respect each @xmath25 are equal to zero",
    ", we corrected the initial guesses for the zero - points . the procedure was then iterated until the number of pairs @xmath28 became stable .",
    "the second step was to make use of those fields observed under photometric conditions in order to converge on the best zero - point .",
    "standards were measured several times over a broad range of airmasses on the first two nights of the observations , which had the best photometric conditions ( see table  [ tbl : log ] ) .",
    "only the second night ( may 5 ) was really photometric since all the measurements are coherent ( see figure  [ fig : zeropoint ] )",
    ". magnitudes were calibrated to the kron - cousins system using landolt standards taken from landolt ( 1992 ) . they have been obtained using an aperture of 6 arcsec in diameter , large enough to obtain accurate measurements according to the growth curves of all the measured stars .",
    "we have fitted the linear relationship : @xmath30 with @xmath31 magnitude of landolt standard , @xmath32 airmass during the observation , @xmath33 counts during the exposure time @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 the zero and extinction terms , respectively .",
    "we used an iterative 3@xmath8 clipping in order to discard deviant measurements , finding the best fit for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the standard deviation of the residuals for the best fit is 0.03 .",
    "the analysis of the survey data produced a set of intermediate and final products , images and catalogs , which are publicly available at the spitzer science center and noao science archives .",
    "in particular , we provide the astronomical community with :    * coadded ( stacked ) images of the subfields * : sky - subtracted , fully processed coadded frames for each subfield .",
    "the subfields are mapped using a tangential projection .",
    "the size of each fits compressed image is 220 mb . for each image , a bad pixel mask and an exposure map is given ( in the pixel - list iraf format ) .",
    "the photometric zero - point of each subfield after the absolute photometric calibration of the frame appears in the header of the image .",
    "a full description of the header keywords is available at the http sites .    *",
    "low - resolution field image * : sky - subtracted , fully processed coadded images of the whole field .",
    "the images have been created to give a general overview of the fls and elais - n1 fields and have been produced using a 1.3 arcsec pixel size ( corresponding to five times the original size of the pixel ) .",
    "users are discouraged from using them to extract sources and compute photometry .",
    "these images have a size of approximatively 380 mb and 80 mb .    * single subfield catalogs * : object catalogs associated with each single subfield .",
    "a full description of the parameters available is described in the following section .",
    "the catalogs are in ascii format .",
    "the main goal of this survey is to catalog galaxies and faint stars and make a first distinction between stars and galaxies on the basis of their intensity profiles .",
    "several bright objects ( mainly stars ) are saturated and excluded from the catalog , but can be found in catalogs from shallower surveys ( like the sloan digital sky survey in the case of the fls region , see e.g. stoughton et al .",
    "2002 and hogg et  al .",
    "the source extraction was performed with the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ; ver .",
    "2.3 ) which is well suited for surveys with low to moderate source density as is the case of our surveys .",
    "several parameters have to be fixed to achieve an efficient source extraction with sextractor .",
    "the first problem is the evaluation of the background .",
    "sextractor proceeds computing a _ mini - background _ on a scale large enough to contain several faint objects and filtering it with a box - car to avoid the contamination by isolated , extended objects .",
    "finally , a full - resolution background map is obtained by interpolation and it is subtracted from the science image . in our case , many bright stars populate the fls field since it has a moderate galactic latitude ( 34.9 degrees ) while the problem is less important in the case of the elais - n1 field ( gal .",
    "latitude : 44.9 degrees ) . to evaluate a background",
    "which is not locally dominated by bright stars we adopted meshes of 128@xmath9128 pixels for the _ mini - background _ corresponding to 33.0 arcsec and used a 9@xmath99 box - car for the median - filtering .    in order to improve the detection of faint sources , the image is filtered to enhance the spatial frequency typical of the sources with respect to those of the background noise . a gaussian filter with an fwhm similar to the seeing of the image ( in our case 4 pixels , since the overall seeing is 1.1 ) has been used .",
    "although the choice of a convolution kernel with a constant fwhm may not always be optimal since the seeing is varying in the different images , the impact on detectability is fairly small ( irwin 1985 ) .",
    "moreover , it has the advantage of requiring no changes of the relative detection threshold .",
    "finally , the detection is made on the background - subtracted and filtered image looking for groups of connected pixel above the detection threshold .",
    "thresholding is in fact the most efficient way to detect low surface brightness objects . in our case",
    ", we fixed the minimum number of connected pixels to 15 and the detection threshold to 0.8 ( in units of the standard deviation of the background noise ) , which corresponds to a typical limiting surface brightness @xmath39 mag arcsec@xmath40 .",
    "for the detection we made use also of the exposure map as a weight considered to set the noise level for each pixel .",
    "some pixels have a null weight since they correspond to saturated objects , trails of bright objects and other artifacts .",
    "these pixels are also marked in the bad pixel mask and the false detections around these image artifacts are flagged and easily excluded from our final catalogs .",
    "only objects detected with a signal - to - noise greater than 3 ( based on the total magnitude errors ) are accepted in our final catalog .",
    "although not well suited to detect objects in crowded fields , sextractor allows one also to deblend close objects using a multiple isophotal analysis technique .",
    "two parameters affect the deblending : the number of thresholds used to split a set of connected pixels according to their luminosity peaks and the minimal contrast ( light in a peak divided by the total light in the object ) used to decide if deblending a sub - object from the rest of the object .",
    "in our analysis we used a high number of thresholds ( 64 ) and a very low minimal contrast ( 1.5 @xmath41 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a few blended objects still remain in the catalogs .",
    "visual inspection or other extraction algorithms more efficient in crowded fields ( e.g , daophot ) are needed to treat these particular cases .",
    "the photometry has been performed on the stacked images .",
    "several measurements were made : aperture and isophotal magnitudes and an estimate of the total magnitudes .",
    "we measured the aperture magnitude within a diameter of 3 arcsec , roughly corresponding to three times the overall seeing .",
    "total magnitudes ( _ mag_auto _ ) are estimated using an elliptical aperture with an approach similar to that proposed by kron ( 1980 ) . since these fields have been selected in sky regions with low galactic extinction to observe extragalactic infrared sources , the corrections for galactic extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) are small : 0.06 and 0.01 on average for the fls and elais - n1 fields , respectively .",
    "the total magnitude of sources close to bright objects are usually inaccurate since the local background is affected by the halo of the bright objects and the kron radius is not correctly computed . to improve the photometry for these sources we have subtracted bright saturated stars from the images and excluded from the catalogs the sources detected in square boxes around these stars where the subtraction is not correct .",
    "moreover , we have considered bright extended galaxies and excluded from the catalogs all the sources inside the kron ellipses of the galaxies . in fact , most of these sources are bright regions of the galaxies or their photometry is highly affected by the diffuse luminosity of the galaxies .    to subtract bright saturated stars from the images",
    "we have computed radial density profiles on concentric annuli around the stars .",
    "then , after subtracting these profiles , we have removed the diffraction spikes by fitting their profiles along the radius at different angles with chebyshev polynomials . as visible in figures  [ fig : removestar6 ] and  [ fig : removestar13 ] , the background is much more uniform and the spikes become shorter .",
    "this improves the photometry for the objects surrounding the stars and avoid the detection of faint false sources on the diffraction spikes .",
    "the correction works well for most of the stars , although we exclude from the catalogs the immediate neighborhood . in the case of very bright stars ( fig  [ fig : removestar13 ] ) , multiple reflections between the ccd and",
    "the optics make difficult the subraction of a median radial profile and a faint halo is still visible after the correction .",
    "sextractor uses a neural network to separate star - like from extended sources returning a stellarity index ( _ class_star _ ) with values between 1 ( a perfect star - like object ) and 0 .",
    "the distribution of this index as a function of the magnitude in one of our fields ( fls18 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : stellarity ] .",
    "the standard neural network of sextractor has been trained for seeing fwhm values between 0.02 and 5.5 arcsec and for images that have 1.5 @xmath42 fwhm @xmath42 5 pixels .",
    "it is therefore perfectly suited for our images .",
    "although at bright magnitudes two sequences can be easily distinguished ( see figure  [ fig : stellarity ] ) , for fainter magnitudes it becomes more difficult to separate extended from point objects . in order to select stars in an efficient way , we followed the technique of groenewegen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) choosing a threshold which is a function of the magnitude .",
    "we consider that our objects are stars if : @xmath43    a drawback of this technique is that at faint magnitudes qsos are also classified as stars . however ,",

    "since we are considering in our catalogs an aperture of 3 arcsec and our typical fhwm is 1.0 arcsec , these values are slightly deeper than what one can find in our catalogs .",
    "the fraction of spurious objects was estimated by creating catalogs from the survey images multiplied by -1 . since",
    "ideally the noise is symmetric , we can use these images to produce a catalog of spurious sources by applying the same criteria of extraction which have been used with the real images . analyzing the central square degree ,",

    "degree which correspond to 17% of the total of number of sources detected in this magnitude range .          to assess the accuracy of the astrometric calibration , we compared the positions of the stars inside the fls field with those available from the sloan survey ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , data release 1 ) and with radio sources from the vla survey in the fls field ( condon et al .",
    "2003 ) .        in the comparison with the sloan sources",
    ", we considered only good objects ( according to the flags ) classified as stars in the sloan catalog with r magnitude between 18 and 21 .",
    "table  [ tbl : astrometry ] reports the number of stars used in the comparison and the offsets between our and sloan positions .",
    "typical offsets are 0.1 arcsec in right ascension and declination with an rms of 0.1 arcsec . the offsets between our catalog and the sloan stars in the case of the field fls-18 are shown in figure  [ fig : cfr_astro ] . the comparison with the vla sources has been made considering all the optical counterparts down to r=24 of non - extended radio sources .",
    "the offsets from the vla positions are also of order 0.1 arcsec .     in the various fls fields .",
    "the average difference is @xmath53 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the systematic offset between ours and sloan positions comes from the fact that our astrometry is based on the usno - a2 catalog , while sloan takes tycho2 stars as reference . comparing the sloan and usno - a2 positions in the whole fls field",
    ", we have an offset of @xmath54 and @xmath55 arcsec which is in complete agreement with the offsets found in table  [ tbl : astrometry ] .    finally , we compared our r - band catalog to the gsc  ii finding an offset of @xmath56 and @xmath57 arcsec . while not large , this offset should be noted when making comparison to data sets that used the gsc  ii for reference .",
    "nevertheless , the remarkably small rms in both directions obtained comparing our and sloan positions suggests an intrinsic accuracy of @xmath58 arcsec for each catalog which is well within the requirements for slit / fiber positioning , an essential requirement for public surveys .",
    "the sloan survey also allows us to compare the photometric calibration .",
    "although the magnitude system used in this survey is different from ours , we can obtain a relationship between the r cousin magnitude and the sloan magnitudes using the 92 landolt stars which have been observed by the sloan group to calibrate their observations ( smith et al . 2002 ) . before making the comparison ,",
    "we have converted the r and i magnitudes to the sdss 2.5 m natural system , using the equations : @xmath59 as explained at the sloan web site .",
    "then , we have obtained a relationship between r and the sloan colors with a least square fit : @xmath60 using a biweight estimator , the difference between the real r and the value estimated with the relationship ( [ eqt : landolt_sloan ] ) is on average of 0.0001 ( with an rms of 0.007 ) . in spite of the large scatter , the relationship is useful from a statistical point of view since we are interested only in confirming our magnitude zero - point .",
    "we have therefore compared the magnitudes of the stars in the fls fields with the values deduced from the sloan survey with the equation ( [ eqt : landolt_sloan ] ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : astrometry ] summarizes the median differences in magnitude between our measurements ( _ auto - magnitudes _ ) and the _ model _ complete magnitude as computed by sloan for stars with magnitude @xmath23 in the different fls fields . in figure  [ fig : magoff18 ] we show the distribution of the magnitude offsets in the case of the central field fls-18 , while in figure  [ fig : magoff ] we illustrate the offsets for the various fields .",
    "our calibration agrees on average with the sloan one , since the average difference between our and sloan measurements is @xmath53 .",
    "the biggest differences are found in the external subfields where the relative zero is not well constrained due to the low number of stars in common between adjacent subfields ( see figure  [ fig : magoff ] ) .",
    "counting galaxies and stars as a function of the magnitude allows one to evaluate the overall characteristics of a catalog as depth and homogeneity .",
    "in figures  [ fig : starcounts ] and  [ fig : galscounts ] we show star and galaxy counts in the fls region and compare them with analogous counts using the sloan digital sky survey ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to compare the two distributions ,",
    "we have transformed the sdss magnitudes into the r vega magnitudes using the relationship  [ eqt : landolt_sloan ] .    in the case of star counts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starcounts ] ) , the counts from our survey and the sdss agree very well between r=18 and r=22 . for magnitudes brighter than r=18 , most of the stars detected in our survey are saturated and do not appear in our catalogs .",
    "star counts drop very rapidly for magnitudes fainter than r=24 since the profile criterion used for the star / galaxy separation fails for faint objects . for comparison ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : starcounts ] the star counts in the elais field and those in the chandra field ( groenewegen et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "these fields , which lie at higher galactic latitudes are , as expected , less populated by stars .    to evaluate the variation in the number counts due to the varying observing conditions , we have computed the counts for each of the subfield in the fls field . in figure",
    "[ fig : fieldscounts ] we show these counts as well as the median counts with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation as measured from the observed scatter in the counts of the different subfields .",
    "one can easily see that a few subfields ( # 4 , # 7 , # 8 , # 15 and # 26 ) are less deep than the other ones , as expected from the quantities measured in table  [ tbl : summary ] .",
    "fortunately , these fields are external and have been only partially covered by spitzer observations .",
    "the other 20 fields in the fls are quite homogeneous .",
    "median counts are then reported in figure  [ fig : galscounts ] to compare them with the results from other surveys .",
    "the dotted line corresponds the counts from sdss in the fls field ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) computed transforming the sdss magnitudes into the r vega magnitudes using the relationship in equation ( [ eqt : landolt_sloan ] ) .",
    "the points from the general sdss counts ( yasuda et al .",
    ", 2001 ) have been approximatively transformed using the relationship by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) assuming that galaxies have @xmath61 colors typical of spirals at redshift of 0.2    0.5 .",
    "at the faint end of the counts , results from several deep surveys are reported .    as an estimate of the completeness of our images",
    "we have compared our counts to the sdss counts in the fls field for r@xmath4221 and to median counts from the other deep surveys at magnitudes fainter than @xmath62 . in figure",
    "[ fig : completeness ] we show the completeness of the single subfields in the fls field ( thin lines ) and those of the global field and the sdss survey ( continuous and dashed thick lines , respectively ) .",
    "our survey is deeper than the sdss data by almost three magnitudes .",
    "it is 50% complete around r=24.5 .",
    "this estimate is conservative , since the number of spurious detection at r=24.5 is still relatively small ( less than 0.5% ) .",
    "finally , for magnitudes brighter than r=18 , the galaxy catalogs are slightly incomplete since a few extended objects are saturated .         and that of median counts from several deep surveys at @xmath63 . dotted thin lines show the completeness of single fls subfields , while the dashed line shows the completeness of the sdss survey in the fls field . ,",

    "<S> the r - band images were obtained using the mosaic-1 camera on the mayall 4 m telescope of the kitt peak national observatory . </S>",
    "<S> two relatively large regions of the sky were observed to modest depth : the main fls extra galactic field ( @xmath0 @xmath1 j2000 ; l@xmath2 , b@xmath3 ) and elais - n1 field ( @xmath4 @xmath5 j2000 ; l@xmath6 , b@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while both of these fields were in early plans for the fls , only a single deep pointing test observation was made at the elais - n1 location . </S>",
    "<S> the larger legacy program swire ( lonsdale et al . , 2003 ) will include this region among its surveyed areas . </S>",
    "<S> the data products of our kpno imaging ( images and object catalogs ) are made available to the community through the world wide web ( via the spitzer science center and noao science archives ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall quality of the images is high . </S>",
    "<S> the measured positions of sources detected in the images have rms uncertainties in their absolute positions of order 0.35 arc - seconds with possible systematic offsets of order 0.1 arc - seconds , depending on the reference frame of comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the relative astrometric accuracy is much better than 0.1 of an arc - second . </S>",
    "<S> typical delivered image quality in the images is 1.1 arc - seconds full width at half maximum . </S>",
    "<S> images are relatively deep since they reach a median 5@xmath8 depth limiting magnitude of r=25.5 ( vega ) , as measured within a 1.35  @xmath9  fwhm aperture for which the s / n ratio is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> catalogs have been extracted using sextractor using thresholds in area and flux for which the number of false detections is below 1% at r=25 . only sources with s / n greater than 3 have been retained in the final catalogs . comparing the galaxy number counts from our images with those of deeper r - band surveys </S>",

    "<S> these limits in depth are sufficient to identify a substantial fraction of the infrared sources which will be detected by _ spitzer_. </S>"
