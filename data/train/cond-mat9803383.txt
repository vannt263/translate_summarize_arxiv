    "the electron - electron interaction is generally recognized now to be fundamentally important in one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures .",
    "the interaction of 1d electrons turns out to be so significant that the fermi liquid concept breaks down .",
    "more adequate becomes the notion of a strongly correlated state known as luttinger liquid ( ll ) with bosonlike excitations .",
    "@xcite the commonly used ll model treats the electron - electron interaction as the short - range one . in this approach",
    ", the electron - electron interaction changes the electron liquid compressibility giving rise to a renormalization of charge - wave velocity . generally speaking ,",
    "the renormalization parameter @xmath0 is a function of the wave vector @xmath1 of boson excitations .",
    "however , within the short - range interaction approach the parameter @xmath0 is supposed to be a constant .",
    "presently there is no unambiguous evidence that the ll really exists in quantum wires or those rejecting this concept .",
    "the experiment of tarucha _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has shown that the dc conductance of a quantum wire structure is quantized by standard steps @xmath2 .",
    "this result was explained in the frame of the ll model .  @xcite more recently , yacoby _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have found a nonuniversal conductance quantization by steps different from @xmath2 .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the experiments on quantum wires reveal more complex behavior of 1d conduction than the simple ll model predicts .",
    "thus an important problem is to develop the theory for actual quantum wire structures .",
    "application of the ll theory for this purpose points out two problems .",
    "first , the assumption that electrons interact with each other locally is evidently inadequate in the real situation since the coulomb interaction is essentially nonlocal .",
    "this assumption is often justified  @xcite by the screening effect of the highly conducting gate electrode . in this case",
    "the gate current should be taken into account  @xcite to provide the charge conservation and cause the theory to be gauge invariant .",
    "@xcite hence the screening effect of conducting electrodes ( gates and leads ) should be thoroughly analyzed and taken into consideration in order to understand the experimental situation . in reality , the screening by the electrodes consists in the appearance of image charges of the electrons which are situated inside the quantum wire . due to the image charges , the electron - electron interaction becomes dipolelike ( or generally multipolelike ) but the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 may be essential for the structures realized experimentally .",
    "second , the conductance of the mesoscopic quantum wire structure is known  @xcite to be substantially determined by the contacts of the wire with the leads . besides , the contacts between the quantum wire and the leads cause reflection of bosonlike excitations which determines the high - frequency behavior of the admittance .",
    "@xcite thus , the interaction of electrons moving in the quantum wire with leads has to be taken into consideration .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to obtain the actual form of the electron - electron interaction potential in quantum wire structures with leads and to investigate the phase - coherent transport of electrons in both the dc and ac regimes .",
    "the difficulty of this problem is caused by a nonlocal nature of the interaction and by the fact that in a quantum wire of finite length the translational symmetry is broken and hence the electron - electron interaction potential depends separately on the coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 of interacting electrons rather than on the difference @xmath5 .",
    "we have found a situation in which this problem is solved exactly in the frame of the bosonization technique .",
    "it is realized when the lead surfaces may be approximated by planes perpendicular to the wire .",
    "it is worth noting that there is an alternative ( contactless ) approach in studying the ac transport of electrons in quantum wires . in this case",
    "the quantum wire is not supplied with leads .",
    "the ac transport is investigated by means of measuring the absorption or scattering of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this situation was recently considered by cuniberti , sassetti , and kramer  @xcite for a homogeneous quantum wire of infinite length .",
    "they have investigated ac conductance defined via the absorption of electromagnetic radiation taking into account the electron - electron interaction of finite range and an arbitrary distribution of the external electric field along the wire .",
    "it was found that both the interaction length and the electric field distribution affect significantly the ac conductance . in the present paper",
    "we show that the leads produce an essential effect due to inhomogeneity of the electron - electron interaction in the wire .",
    "it manifests itself in the charge - density distribution along the wire and the frequency dependence of the impedance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the potential of electron - electron interaction in a quantum wire structure with leads is obtained for the electron interaction with the charges induced on the leads taken into account .",

    "iv , charge - density distribution in the structure is investigated for both the dc and ac regimes .",
    "section v contains the calculation and analysis of the impedance of the quantum wire structure .",
    "the mesoscopic structure under consideration consists of a quantum wire coupled to two bulky ( 2d or 3d ) regions ( the electron reservoirs ) which serve as leads .",
    "the electrons in the wire interact with each other both directly and via the surface charges which are induced on the surface of the leads .",
    "the electron - electron interaction energy @xmath6 is defined by the product of the electron density @xmath7 at a point @xmath8 and the potential @xmath9 created at this point by the charge at a point @xmath10 .",
    "this potential is determined by the laplace equation with boundary conditions corresponding to the given configuration of the leads .",
    "when calculating @xmath9 , it is reasonable to consider the lead surfaces as equipotential ones .",

    ", a homogeneous wire of infinite length with a continuous spectrum of eigensolutions was examined which results in a dispersion relation @xmath160 .",
    "the resonant feature of the impedance is caused by the inflection point of @xmath161 where the group velocity reaches a minimum , with the characteristic wavelength of the charge waves being of the order of the wire radius . in the present paper",
    ", we consider a more specific situation of a finite wire restricted by leads with a discrete spectrum of eigenfunctions .",
    "the resonances we have found are attributed to the finite length of the wire .",
    "they appear when the characteristic wavelength of the charge waves is of the order of the wire length , i.e. , the frequency is much lower than the resonant frequency which appears in ref .  .",
    "the total admittance of the quantum wire structure is formed by both the quantum wire impedance @xmath143 defined by eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) and the interelectrode capacitance @xmath162 which is necessarily present there .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ j_meas ] ) one obtains @xmath163    it is of interest to find the eigenfrequencies of the admittance ( the impedance ) which describe the behavior of the system under consideration as an element of electric circuit .",
    "they are known to be determined by the poles and zeros of the admittance ( the impedance ) .",
    "the admittance zeros characterize the system when the external circuit is open while the poles correspond to the short - circuit case .",
    "equation  ( [ y_tot ] ) shows that the poles of @xmath164 coincide with the zeros of @xmath143 ( or the poles of the quantum wire admittance ) .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ z ] ) and ( [ d ] ) that there is only one set of eigenfrequencies which are complex with a negative imaginary part corresponding to decaying fluctuations .",
    "several authors have found two sets of the eigenfrequencies in the case of short - range interacting electrons for a three - terminal structure  @xcite or using an other way for the calculation of the observed current .  @xcite both sets of eigenfunctions also describe the decaying fluctuations .    of more interest ,",
    "in our opinion , are the zeros of @xmath165 .",
    "we show that in this case the conditions can be found under which the eigenfrequencies are real and charge - wave excitations are very slowly decaying . according to eq .",
    "( [ y_tot ] ) , @xmath166 when two equations are satisfied simultaneously : @xmath167 the first equation is obviously satisfied by the set of real frequencies @xmath117 defined by eq .",
    "( [ omega_n ] ) .",
    "the second equation can also be satisfied at one of frequencies @xmath117 if the capacitance @xmath162 is appropriately fitted , for instance , via changing the lead areas .",
    "the resonant value of @xmath162 is estimated as @xmath168 physically , eq .  (",
    "[ a ] ) means the absence of dissipation while eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) is a resonant condition for the circuit which consists of the quantum wire inductance and the interelectrode capacitance . under this condition ,",
    "the resonant frequency of the charge waves in the wire coincides with that of the @xmath169 circuit , which results in a strong increase of the charge - wave amplitude .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the linear transport of interacting electrons in a quantum wire of mesoscopic length with massive leads .",
    "the key point is the full enough account of the actual coulomb interaction inside the wire and of three - dimensional electric field in the surrounding media .",
    "the coulomb interaction in a mesoscopic quantum wire includes both the direct interaction of electrons with each other and their interaction via the image charges induced on the leads .",
    "we have found an exact analytical solution of the problem .",
    "this has become possible due to ( _ i _ ) use of the bosonization technique which is well suited to consider the low - energy excitation of 1d interacting electrons , and ( _ ii _ ) solving the equation of motion for the bosonic phase field by expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of the electron - electron interaction operator , which have been found for a model case where the electrodes are plates perpendicular to the wire .",
    "we have found that the actual coulomb interaction affects strongly the electron density distribution along the wire in comparison with that in the case of short - range interacting electrons in the conventional ll model .",
    "the nonlocal coulomb interaction manifests itself first of all in the noticeable increase of the charge density in the vicinity of the contacts with leads . here",
    "the electron density perturbation decreases exponentially with the distance from the contact .",
    "this effect is essential when the frequency is not too high ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "another effect of the coulomb interaction is the renormalization of the charge - wave velocity .",
    "namely , in contrast with the short - range ll model the long - range coulomb interaction causes the frequency - dependent renormalization of the charge - wave velocity .",
    "this effect manifests itself in the frequency dependence of the real part of the impedance . with increasing frequency @xmath147 oscillates between two limiting values which are independent of the interaction",
    ". these are zero and @xmath145 .",
    "the fact that @xmath147 becomes zero is related to the resonances of the charge waves along the wire length .",
    "such resonances occur also when there is no long - range interaction .",
    "the coulomb interaction causes the resonances to be nonequidistant in frequency , which means that the charge - wave velocity is frequency - dependent . at low frequency",
    "the charge - wave velocity is essentially larger than the fermi velocity . with increasing frequency ,",
    "the charge - wave velocity decreases and tends asymptotically to the fermi velocity .",

    "the current @xmath137 being detected by the measuring device in the external circuit is equal to the charge flow in the leads .",
    "since the currents in the left and right leads are obviously equal each other let us consider the current in the left electrode .",
    "it is equal to the sum of the charge flow through the wire @xmath171 and the charge stored at the lead surface per unit time : @xmath172 the charge @xmath173 consists of two components .",
    "one is the external charge caused by the applied voltage if the wire is absent , @xmath174 , with @xmath162 being the mutual capacity of the electrodes .",
    "the other component is the charge @xmath175 induced by the charges located within the wire .",
    "the latter is determined as @xmath176 where @xmath177 @xmath178 is the potential of the charge distributed along the wire and @xmath67 is the outward normal to the lead surface .",
    "the potential @xmath39 is expressed in terms of the charge density @xmath7 via the green function @xmath179 of the laplace equation with zero boundary conditions at the lead surfaces .",

    "is a particular case of the general shockley theorem .",
    "@xcite for arbitrary form and configuration of the leads the shockley theorem is presented as follows @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the potential difference between the leads and @xmath187 is the electric field along the electron trajectory due to @xmath186 .",
    "according to the original derivation ,  @xcite the field @xmath187 appears here as a result of using the reciprocity theorem when calculating the charge induced in the leads by the charges moving along the wire .",
    "thus , @xmath187 has a sense of the external electric field which does not include the polarization of the 1d electron system .",
    "recently  @xcite a question was discussed regarding which electric field determines the measured electric current in the quantum wire  the external field or the internal one  which depends on the polarization of 1d electrons . in this connection",
    "we note that in our case the current calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ j_meas1 ] ) does not depend on what electric field is used .",
