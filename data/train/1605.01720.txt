    "the revival of research on the solid state thermoelectric cooling and electrical power generation devices could be mainly attributed to their attractive features , such as long life , the absence of moving parts and emissions of toxic gases , low maintenance and high reliability.@xcite present thermoelectric materials have relatively low energy conversion efficiency that can be evaluated by thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath12 is the electrical resistivity , @xmath1 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath13 is the absolute temperature .",
    "recent efforts to design materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties were mainly focused on reducing the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity by alloy scattering , superstructures or nanostructure engineering.@xcite on the other hand , interest in the potential merits of electronic correlation effects was revived by the discovery of large seebeck coefficients in transition metal compounds , such as fesi and na@xmath14coo@xmath0.@xcite in a kondo insulator , localized _",
    "f _ or _ d _ states hybridize with conduction electron states leading to the formation of a small hybridization gap with the large density of states ( dos ) just below and above the gap .",
    "this resonance in dos centered at about 2 - 3 @xmath15 from the fermi energy could induce very large seebeck coefficient , as observed in fesi .",
    "@xcite up to now , most of the effort has been concentrated on the high temperature range whereas current thermoelectric materials achieve poor thermoelectric efficiency at the cryogenic temperature range .",
    "space science applications , cryocooling , and microelectronic superconducting quantum interference devices could be improved by a reliable effective solid state cooling .",
    "very recently , simply binary compound fesb@xmath0 with an orthorhombic structure has been characterized as an example of strongly correlated non - cubic kondo insulator with 3d ions . @xcite large value of seebeck coefficient at 10 k and a record high thermoelectric power factor @xmath16 were observed .",
    "@xcite this might imply the fesb@xmath0-based materials with narrow energy gaps and correlated bands could be good thermoelectrics at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "however , zt is very low due to the very large thermal conductivity values .",
    "it was shown that properties of kondo insulators are sensitive to chemical substitution.@xcite forming solid solution , i.e. , maximizing the influence of point - defect scattering by creating large mass difference and elastic strain at the lattice sites , proved to be an efficient approach to suppress the thermal conductivity and enhance zt of some thermoelectric materials , such as filled skutterudites materials co(sb@xmath17as@xmath14)@xmath18 , co@xmath17ni@xmath14as@xmath18 , and bismuth based materials bi@xmath0(se / sb / te)@xmath18 .",
    "@xcite here , we clarify the influence of the different chemical substitution at fe and sb site on the thermoelectric properties of fesb@xmath0 . by @xmath2 te doping on sb sites thermal conductivity reduces from @xmath3 w / km in fesb@xmath0 to about 8 w / km in fe(sb@xmath19te@xmath20)@xmath0 .",
    "this is more significant than the suppression of thermal conductivity by co or cr doping at fe site due to the different bonding tendency of sb and te . whereas the doping at fe site rapidly smears out the seebeck coefficient peak at low temperature , for te substitution at sb site this peak survives in the wide doping region .",
    "consequently an enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit ( @xmath21 at @xmath7 k ) in fe(sb@xmath8te@xmath9)@xmath0 is obtained when compared to @xmath22 in undoped fesb@xmath0 .",
    "fe@xmath17t@xmath14sb@xmath0 ( t = cr and co ) and fe(sb@xmath17te@xmath14)@xmath0 single crystals were grown from excess sb flux , as described previously . @xcite powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectra of the ground samples were taken with cu @xmath23 radiation ( @xmath24 ) using a rigaku miniflex x - ray machine .",
    "the lattice parameters were obtained by fitting the xrd pattern using the rietica software .",
    "@xcite elemental analysis was performed using an energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) in a jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscopy .",
    "thermal transport properties including thermal conductivity , seebeck coefficient , as well as electrical resistivity were measured in quantum design ppms-9 from 2 k to 300 k using one - heater - two - thermometer method .",
    "the direction of heat and electric current transport was along the c - axis of single grain crystals oriented using a laue camera .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction patterns show that all fe(sb@xmath17te@xmath14)@xmath0 ( @xmath25 ) , ( fe@xmath17cr@xmath14)sb@xmath0 and ( fe@xmath17co@xmath14)sb@xmath0 samples crystallize in the _ pnnm _ structure without any impurity phases .",
    "for example , lattice parameters of te - doped samples are shown in fig .",
    "the effect of te substitution on the sb site is to expand the unit cell volume when compared to fesb@xmath0 .",
    "this expansion is anisotropic and the lattice contracts in the _ ab_-plane while expands along the _ c_-axis ( fig .",

    "the electron term @xmath50 estimated using wiedemann - franz law @xmath53 , is @xmath54 of the total thermal conductivity , indicating a predominantly phonon contribution .",
    "the suppression of thermal conductivity should reflect enhanced phonon scattering . in general , phonon scattering can be realized through point defect scattering , carrier - phonon scattering , boundary scattering , phonon umklapp scattering and void filling.@xcite in what follows we do not consider the carrier - phonon scattering processes since the carrier concentrations in our crystrals are low .",
    "our samples are single crystals , hence the boundary scattering should not dominate the phonon scattering process . moreover , umklapp process should not vary significantly by replacing small amount of sb with te .",
    "thus only enhanced point defect scattering should be responsible for the suppression of thermal conductivity .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity is usually treated using the debye approximation:@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is dimensionless , @xmath57 is the phonon frequency , @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath59 is the planck constant , @xmath60 is the debye temperature , @xmath61 is the velocity of sound , and @xmath62 is the relaxation time.@xcite the overall relaxation rate @xmath63 can be determined by combining various scattering processes @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the relaxation times for boundary scattering , defect scattering and umklapp processes , respectively , @xmath49 is the rayleigh point defect rate .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity of all crystals can be well understood with this model .",

    "the fitting parameters for all samples are shown in table i. the fitted grain size varies from 42 to 80 @xmath42 m with no evident trend among the samples .",
    "the umklapp scattering parameters @xmath68 are small and do not exhibit significant change with doping .",
    "the point defect scattering rate @xmath49 increases with increase in doping level , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) and table i. this confirms that the suppression of thermal conductivity in doped fesb@xmath0 originates from enhanced point defect scattering .",
    "the enhanced point defect scattering in solid solutions has been reported in many semiconductor systems , such as doped cosb@xmath18 , bi@xmath0(se / sb / te)@xmath18 , si - ge solution.@xcite the suppression of thermal conductivity by te doping at sb site is more significant when compared to these solutions and co / cr - doped fesb@xmath0 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath49 for point defect scattering can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the unit cell volume , @xmath71 is the sound velocity and @xmath72 is the scattering parameter.@xcite in solid solutions , point defect scattering originates from the mass fluctuations ( @xmath73 ) and interatomic coupling force difference ( strain field fluctuations)(@xmath74 ) .",
    "these two contribution are additive : @xmath75 . for the solution",
    "fe(sb@xmath17te@xmath14)@xmath0 , @xmath76.@xcite since the mass difference between sb and te is very small ( only @xmath77 ) and is nearly same to the relative change between fe and co / cr , the mass fluctuation can not induce large increase in point defect scattering ratio .",
    "therefore , mechanism of point defect scattering most likely originates from the strain field fluctuation due to differences in size or bonding .",
    "the size difference between sb and te is also close to the difference btween fe and co / cr .",
    "according to pauling electronegativity @xcite , fe , co and cr have nearly same electronegativity , whereas sb and te have different electronegativity and reside at different side of the metal / nometal boundary .",
    "this results in more than one order of larger @xmath1 at room temperature and nearly 3 orders of magnitude at 10 k for sb when compared to te . @xcite",
    "subsequently the te doping and fe - te bonds likely induce large bonding fluctuation which is absent in co / cr - doped systems .",
    "this induces the large strain field fluctuation and enhanced point defect scattering in te - doped fesb@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we studied the influence of different chemical substitution at fe and sb site on thermal conductivity and thermoelectric effect of fesb@xmath0 in high quality single crystals .",
    "all dopants suppress the thermal conductivity . at @xmath2 of te doping at sb site thermal conductivity",
    "is suppressed from @xmath3 w / km in undoped sample to about 8 w / km .",
    "however , cr and co doping at fe site suppress thermal conductivity more slowly than te doping , and even at 20@xmath4 cr / co doping the thermal conductivity remains @xmath5 w / km .",
    "the analysis of different contributions to phonon scattering indicates that the giant suppression of @xmath1 is due to the enhanced point defect scattering originating from the mass and strain field fluctuations .",
    "the significant enhancement of strain field fluctuation and suppression of thermal conductivity by te doping is attributed to the different bonding tendency and thermal conductivity variations for sb and te . on the other hand ,",
    "the doping at fe site smears out the thermopower peak at low temperature significantly , while for te doping at sb site this peak survives in a wide doping region .",
    "consequently thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath78 in fe(sb@xmath8te@xmath9)@xmath0 at @xmath79 is enhanced by one order of magnitude when compared to fesb@xmath0 .",
