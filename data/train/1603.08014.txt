    "a bridge between the physical world and the virtual information word , wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) collect data from the physical world and communicate it with the virtual information world , such as computers .",
    "proper sensor deployment improves monitoring and controlling the physical environment . to accomplish their tasks ,",
    "wsns should address two needs : ( i ) sensing in the target area and ( ii ) communication between the sensor nodes .",
    "wsns are utilized to collect physical information , such as temperature , humidity , voice and so on .",
    "but , the collected data is useless if it can not be transmitted to the access point ( ap ) and to the outside information world through the ap node .",
    "when sensors are connected by wire lines , the connectivity is provided automatically . on the other hand ,",
    "the connectivity of wsns is not guaranteed . in this paper , we consider the sensing and connectivity together and redefine the goal of wsn design accordingly .",
    "a huge body of literature exists on the topic of sensor deployment .",
    "the sensor coverage range model assumes that sensors can only monitor the points within a range of @xmath0 .",
    "the range @xmath0 is called the sensing range and the coverage area is the area covered by at least one sensor node @xcite .",
    "three different connectivity criteria are proposed in @xcite .",
    "three movement - assisted protocols , the vector - based algorithm , the voronoi - based algorithm and the minimax algorithm , are designed to maximize coverage area in @xcite .",
    "lloyd algorithm has also been used as a tool to deploy sensors in homogeneous wsns @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the lloyd algorithm has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the analysis in [ 4]-[6 ] can be applied to the sensor deployment methods in [ 1 ] .",
    "however , @xcite assumes an infinite communication range and ignores the connectivity limitation .",
    "when an infinite communication range is assumed , all the nodes in the network are connected to each other . in reality , each node has a limited communication range that will affect the connectivity of the network @xcite .",
    "a geometric analysis of the relationship between the sensing coverage and the connectivity is proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have come up with some deployment patterns to achieve both sensing coverage and full connectivity .",
    "unfortunately , given a fixed number of sensor nodes and a finite communication range , connectivity is not guaranteed .",
    "when sensor nodes are divided into several disconnected sub - graphs , the conventional lloyd algorithm can not converge to a proper deployment .",
    "the critical sensor density ( csd ) in @xcite is the number of nodes per unit area , required to provide full sensing coverage when the communication range is limited .",
    "when the sensor density is smaller than csd , we can not achieve the full sensing coverage .",
    "under such a scenario , coverage may not be the right cost function to optimize .",
    "one needs to define an appropriate distortion measure to reflect the sensing accuracy .",
    "distortion , as an important parameter in source coding can also be used to evaluate the wsn performance .",
    "therefore , one can minimize distortion in wsns through vector quantization techniques in @xcite and @xcite . the best possible distortion for a given number of sensors , i.e.",
    ", the minimum distortion for a given rate , can be analyzed through the rate - distortion theory @xcite .",
    "even if the sensor density is larger than csd , there is no existing sensor deployment algorithm designed to achieve the full connectivity and minimize the distortion at the same time . in this paper ,",
    "when the communication range is limited , we take both distortion and connectivity into consideration .",
    "the existing coverage area model is a special case of our distortion measure .",
    "we propose a method , named restrained lloyd ( rl ) algorithm , to distribute sensor nodes and to minimize distortion with full connectivity .",
    "then , a more complex approach , named deterministic annealing ( da ) algorithm , is designed to avoid sub - optimal solutions .    in many practical situations , different sensors in the wsn",
    "have different characteristics such as computational power , sensing range , and sensing accuracy .",
    "the deployment and topology control of such heterogeneous wsns that include the sensor nodes with different communication or sensing ranges , have been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , three movement - assisted protocols in @xcite are designed to avoid coverage hole in heterogeneous wsns .",
    "however , @xcite deploys sensor nodes one - by - one and to deploy a new sensor uses the location information of all previously deployed nodes .",
    "also , @xcite assumes that sensor can monitor events within a circle with the radius equal to the sensing range .",
    "we generalize this model to a sensing accuracy which depends on the distance between the sensor and the event .",
    "our distortion model will include the sensing range model in @xcite as a special case in which the distortion is a step function .",
    "in such heterogeneous wsns , weighted voronoi diagrams @xcite rather than conventional voronoi diagrams @xcite will provide the best regions as we will discuss in this paper . an algorithm to construct weighted voronoi diagrams for a different application",
    "has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "based on the geometry of the optimal cell partitioning , we will analyze the objective functions in our model and propose the necessary condition for the optimal sensor deployment in heterogeneous wsns with different sensing abilities .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we first introduce the system model for both homogeneous and heterogeneous wsns and formulate the problems of sensing and connectivity in section [ sec : model ] .",

    "a cell partition @xmath10 of @xmath1 is a collection of disjoint subsets of @xmath11 whose union is @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a disk centered at @xmath13 with radius @xmath14 in two - dimensional space . for two points @xmath15 and @xmath16 , let equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix and @xmath20 is a constant , define the perpendicular bisector hyperplane between the two points .",
    "then , the equations @xmath21 and @xmath22 define two half spaces .",
    "we denote the half space that contains point @xmath15 by @xmath23 .    as mentioned before , we define the ap as the sensor node that can communicate with the outside information world .",
    "let @xmath24 be the set of sensor nodes that can communicate with the ap when the sensor deployment is @xmath25 .",
    "note that in general not all nodes can communicate with the ap and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of elements in set @xmath28 .",
    "we define a new sensor deployment , which is a subset of the all sensor locations , @xmath29 as the vector of sensor locations for the @xmath30 sensor nodes connected to the ap .",
    "when @xmath24 includes all sensor nodes , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the set of sensor deployments that provide full connectivity , i.e. , @xmath34 . in our model",
    ", two sensor nodes can communicate with each other within one hop if and only if the distance between the two is smaller than @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is referred to as the communication range .",
    "a sensor node can transfer data outside if and only if there exists a path from the sensor to the ap .",
    "the path consists of a sequence of sensor nodes where each hop distance is smaller than the communication range @xmath35 .",
    "sensor nodes that are connected to the ap construct the backbone network .",
    "if all sensors are included in the backbone network , we call the network fully connected .",
    "otherwise , the network is divided into several disconnected sub - graphs .    another important factor in analyzing the performance of a wsn",
    "is its sensing accuracy . ideally , we would like to sense all events in the covered area . however , the sensing accuracy of a sensor node usually depends on the distance between the sensor and the event to be sensed . in other words ,",
    "the accuracy of the gathered data from an event at point @xmath9 by its associated sensor node @xmath6 is a non - increasing function of the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , to represent the average sensing accuracy in the target area , we define the following general distortion : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cost function associated with sensing . the partition @xmath38 in the above definition include all sensor nodes .",
    "however , as explained before , when the communication range is limited , some sensor nodes can not transfer their data back . as a result",
    ", only the sensor nodes in the backbone network can contribute to the sensing and therefore the distortion should be revised as @xmath39 note that to derive eq .",
    "( [ d_s_p ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ d_p ] ) , one has to replace @xmath25 with @xmath29 , i.e. , one has to consider only the sensor nodes that are in the backbone network .",
    "we reiterate that in the case of a fully connected network , @xmath40 and eq .",
    "( [ d_p ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ d_s_p ] ) are identical . obviously , choosing different cost functions in eq .",
    "( [ d_s_p ] ) results in different problem formulations .",
    "one natural choice for the cost function is a continuous function defined by @xmath41 where the cost parameter @xmath42 is a constant that depends on the sensor characteristics . in homogeneous wsns , every sensor node has the same sensing ability and the same cost parameter @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the cost parameter can be ignored in homogeneous wsns .",
    "however , different sensors with different complexity , power and sensing ability are used in heterogeneous wsns .",
    "obviously , the cost parameters @xmath44 reflect the quality of sensor nodes .",
    "the smaller the cost parameter , the stronger the sensing ability . the distortion definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ d_p ] ) and ( [ d_s_p ] ) can represent the sensor coverage area model @xcite as well .",
    "in such a model , the sensors can monitor events within a circle with a fixed radius called the sensing range .",
    "consider a step function defined by @xmath45 adopting the above sensor coverage area model , choosing @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ d_s_p ] ) converts the distortion to the area covered by the sensors .",
    "in such a model , sensors can monitor events within a circle with the radius @xmath47 .",
    "obviously , the coverage area should be maximized while the distortion should be minimized .",
    "since by definition @xmath48 should be a non - decreasing function , to have the sensor coverage area model as a special case of our model , we should choose @xmath49 .",
    "our main goal is to minimize the distortion defined in eq .",
    "( [ d_s_p ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that a necessary condition for such an optimal sensor deployment is to have a fully connected network .",
    "moreover , the distortion is determined by both sensor deployment and cell partitioning .",
    "this is the topic of the discussion in the next section .",
    "in this section , we assume an infinite communication range which results in a connected network for any sensor deployment . given a fully connected network , the distortion @xmath50 is determined by the sensor deployment @xmath25 and the cell partition @xmath51 . in homogeneous wsns ,",
    "given sensors locations , voronoi partitions provide the smallest distortion .",
    "the voronoi region ( partition ) for sensor @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath52 , is the intersection of half spaces @xmath53 . in other words ,",
    "the voronoi region for sensor @xmath6 is the set of all points that are closer to sensor @xmath6 than any other sensor .",
    "the voronoi partition of @xmath1 generated by @xmath25 with respect to the euclidean norm is the collection of sets @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the euclidean norm .",
    "this is because all sensors in homogeneous wsns have the same cost function @xmath57 which is only determined by the euclidean distance @xmath58 . since an event in @xmath52",
    "is monitored by sensor @xmath6 , each event is sensed by the nearest sensor and therefore makes the smallest contribution to the global distortion .",
    "however , in a heterogeneous wsns , the cost function @xmath48 is also affected by the cost parameter @xmath43 , which reflects the sensing ability of sensor @xmath6 .",
    "sensor nodes in heterogeneous wsns can be classified according to their cost parameters @xmath44 .",
    "let us assume there are @xmath59 different sensor types with @xmath59 different cost parameters . given sensor nodes locations , an event at point @xmath9 should be sensed by the sensor with the smallest cost such that its contribution to the global distortion is the lowest possible .",
    "such an optimal partitioning is refer to as the weighted voronoi partitioning .",
    "the weighted voronoi partition of @xmath1 generated by @xmath25 is the collection of sets @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 note that both voronoi regions @xmath62 and weighted voronoi regions @xmath63 are functions of @xmath25 .",
    "since the voronoi partitioning can be considered as a special case of the weighted voronoi partitioning , in which @xmath64 , we simply use @xmath63 to represent both . using the result of weighted voronoi partitioning as the partition in eq .",
    "( [ d_p ] ) , the global distortion can be rewritten as @xmath65 our goal is to find the sensor deployment that minimizes the global distortion . in what follows",
    ", we generate the machinery to find the necessary condition of the optimal sensor deployment .",

    "the proof is provided in appendix a.    before we discuss the optimal sensor deployment in heterogeneous wsns , we need to present the following definitions and lemmas .    a set @xmath71 is called star - shaped if and only if there exists a point @xmath72 such that for all @xmath73 and all @xmath74 $ ] , one has @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the interior of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the boundary of @xmath77 .",

    "[ b ] the union of star - shaped sets that are associated with the same reference point @xmath79 is star - shaped .",
    "given @xmath59 star - shaped sets @xmath88 with the same reference point @xmath79 , the corresponding union is @xmath89 .",
    "since point @xmath79 is the reference point of star - shaped sets @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 and therefore @xmath93 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath77 comes from the boundaries of @xmath59 star - shaped sets @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",

    "( [ critical deployment ] ) .",
    "in this section , we design algorithms to minimize the distortion when the communication range is limited .",
    "first , we quickly review the conventional lloyd algorithm .",
    "lloyd algorithm has two basic steps in each iteration : ( 1 ) sensor nodes move to their centroid ; ( 2 ) partitioning is done by assigning the corresponding voronoi region to each sensor node .",
    "lloyd algorithm provides good performance and is simple enough to be implemented distributively .",
    "it converges to a minimum distortion when the communication range is infinite @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it also has three shortcomings .",
    "first , since minimizing distortion is a non - convex optimization problem , lloyd algorithm may end at a large local minimum point rather than the optimal global minimum .",
    "second , lloyd algorithm may not result in a connected network .",
    "third , when wsns are divided into several disconnected sub - graphs , lloyd algorithm is not feasible . in other words , since there is no global information available about the sensor locations , each sub - graph will run the algorithm independently . to deploy a network with full connectivity and lower distortion , we add some restraints on sensors movements .",
    "we design a class of algorithms based on the lloyd algorithm , referred to as rl algorithm .",
    "before we introduce the details of our rl algorithm , we introduce the concept of a desired region .",
    "let us assume we are trying to move sensor @xmath6 at a given step .",
    "our goal is to keep the connectivity of the backbone network after moving sensor @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we define the areas in which sensor @xmath6 will be connected to the backbone network as its desired region , denoted by @xmath153 .",
    "note that this region may not be a star - shaped set . in our rl algorithm ,",
    "if sensor @xmath6 is in the backbone network , we will restrain its movement within its desired region . to achieve this goal",
    ", we need to find the desired region @xmath153 .",
    "given a deployment @xmath25 , if sensor @xmath6 from the backbone network is removed , the rest of the sensor nodes in the backbone network will be divided into @xmath154 components : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is a set of sensors included in the @xmath108th component .",
    "note that @xmath154 may be equal to one .",
    "then , we can calculate the desired region as @xmath157.\\ ] ] since the desired region is primarily influenced by the neighboring sensor nodes , we can approximate it by @xmath158,\\label{lip}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 consists of sensor @xmath6 s neighbors when the deployment is @xmath25 . note that the approximation in ( [ lip ] ) can be calculated locally , but to calculate the exact desired region , one needs global information . also , according to lemma [ b ] , the approximate desired region @xmath160 is a star - shaped set .",
    "now , we provide the details of our rl algorithm .",
    "the algorithm iterates between two steps : + ( 1 ) sensors in the backbone network move one by one .",
    "every sensor in the backbone network calculates its own approximate desired region @xmath160 and moves to a location which is the closest point to its centroid @xmath161 within @xmath160 .",
    "sensors outside the backbone network move randomly and check if there is a path to the ap . unlike the conventional lloyd algorithm",
    ", these new locations may not be the centroid of the partition regions ; + ( 2 ) the target area , @xmath1 , is partitioned to weighted voronoi regions for sensors in the backbone network , @xmath24 .",
    "the main difference between rl algorithm and the lloyd algorithm is in the first step . in what follows ,",
    "we show that step ( 1 ) in rl algorithm will not increase the global distortion .",
    "the global distortion is the sum of local distortions defined by @xmath162 where @xmath59 is the number of sensors in the backbone network . the local distortion , whether in homogeneous wsns or heterogeneous wsns , is a convex function . according to the parallel axis theorem ,",
    "the local distortions can be rewritten as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the centroid of the partition region @xmath165 with respect to the probability density function .",
    "both @xmath166 and @xmath167 are constants when the integral area @xmath165 is fixed . in other words ,",
    "the local distortion is directly proportional to @xmath168 , i.e. , the sensor s distance to its centroid .",
    "therefore , the movements in step ( 1 ) minimize the local distortions . as the sum of local distortions , the global distortion will not increase . since the sequence of the global distortion values is a non - increasing sequence with a lower bound of zero",
    ", it will converge .",
    "we also show that our rl algorithm guarantees the connectivity of the network with high probability after enough number of iterations .",
    "note that once a sensor node finds a path to the ap , our rl algorithm will keep it in the backbone network .",
    "intuitively , as we have more iterations , the sensors outside the backbone network will move randomly and eventually connect to the ap as well .",
    "quantitatively , for the deployment after @xmath66 iterations , the area in which a sensor can communicate with the backbone network can be calculated by @xmath169\\right)$ ] .",
    "then , the probability that a sensor outside the backbone network is not connected to the ap in its next move is @xmath170 .",
    "after @xmath171 iterations , the probability that a sensor is still out of the backbone network can be calculated by @xmath172\\leq\\left[\\frac{\\mbox{area}(q)-\\min{a_k}}{\\mbox{area}(q)}\\right]^n$ ] and then @xmath173 because of @xmath174 . in other words ,",
    "as long as the number of iterations is large enough , almost all sensor nodes will be included in the backbone network , indicating full connectivity , with high probability .      like any other steepest - descent algorithm , rl",
    "algorithm may converge to a local minimum a large distortion .",
    "one approach to improve the sub - optimal solution or find the global optimal solution , is to use annealing methods .",
    "simulated annealing ( sa ) @xcite is a method in which a candidate sensor movement is generated randomly .",
    "however , sa ignores the characteristics of the objective function and requires burdensome computations . in this paper",
    ", we design a da algorithm which combines ra with annealing to minimize the distortion .",
    "unlike sa , the proposed da generates two new sensor positions deterministically at each iteration ; however , choose one of the two options randomly .",
    "like rl algorithm , our da algorithm iterates between two steps .",
    "the second step is identical to that of rl algorithm . in the first step ,",
    "the algorithm creates two candidate locations for each node in the backbone network .",
    "one candidate is the rl algorithm s candidate that minimizes the local distortion . on the other hand",
    ", the second candidate increases the local distortion .",
    "it is easy to show that to maximize the local distortion for sensor @xmath6 in the backbone network , one should move it to the point @xmath175 on the boundary of the desired region @xmath160 that has the largest distance to the centroid @xmath161 .",
    "but the goal of the second candidate is to increase the distortion and not necessarily maximizing it .",
    "moreover , the distortion is more sensitive to the sensors with smaller cost parameters . in order to avoid increasing distortion too fast , sensor @xmath6 moves to the point @xmath176 .",
    "the algorithm will choose the first candidate with probability @xmath79 and increases @xmath79 from 0 to 1 .",
    "otherwise , the algorithm will choose the second candidate .",
    "in our algorithm , the probability @xmath79 is increased in proportion to @xmath177 , where @xmath66 is the iteration count and for the last @xmath178 iterations we force the probability @xmath179 .",
    "like rl algorithm , da algorithm guarantees connectivity and convergence .",
    "the proof is similar to that of rl algorithm and is omitted .",
    "we compare the performance of rl algorithm , da algorithm and lloyd algorithm in sensor networks .",
