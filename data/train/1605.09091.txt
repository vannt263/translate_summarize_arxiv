    "the charmomium - like states provide us a good way to study the nonperturbative behavior of qcd , so they have attracted a lot of attention of theorists and experimentalists .",
    "people had detailed summarized the present experimental status of the @xmath20 particles , gave the productions and properties of @xmath20 states  @xcite . as two of these new observed particles , there are already some theoretical studies on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . ref .",
    "@xcite calculate the mass of @xmath0 as @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite gave the production of @xmath0 which was assumed as @xmath22 state in weak decay of @xmath4 in the framework of the light - cone qcd sum rules approach .",
    "@xcite had studied the inclusive production of @xmath0 in the decay of ground bottomnium state @xmath23 by the nrqcd factorization formula , and they also considered @xmath0 as the excited @xmath2 state .",

    ", more and more people had studied the @xmath4 meson by different methods , such as different relativistic constituent quark models  @xcite , the covariant light - front quark model  @xcite and perturbative qcd factorization approach  @xcite . in these literatures",

    "we focused on @xmath4 decays to @xmath35 and @xmath36 states , because when the final states were @xmath37 states , the corresponding branching ratios were very small , and there were only limited data of @xmath4 available .",
    "now the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will produce as much as @xmath38 @xmath4 events per year  @xcite .",
    "the huge amount of @xmath4 events will provide us a chance to study @xmath4 decay to @xmath37 states , some channels also provide an opportunities to discover the new particles in @xmath4 decay .",
    "the mesons can be described by the b - s equation .",
    "@xcite took the b - s equation to describe the light mesons @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then they calculated the mass and decay constant of @xmath39 by the b - s amplitudes  @xcite , they also studied the weak decays  @xcite and the strong decays  @xcite combine the dyson - schwinger equation .",
    "but in this paper , we describe the properties of heavy mesons and the matrix elements of weak currents by improved b - s method , which include two improvement  @xcite : one is about relativistic wavefunctions which describe bound states with definite quantum number , and a relativistic form of wavefunctions are solutions of the full salpeter equations .",
