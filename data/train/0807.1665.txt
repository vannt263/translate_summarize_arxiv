    "the milky way galaxy hosts two stellar disks .",
    "the properties of the disks appear to differ in that the thick disk is older and more metal - poor than the thin disk .",
    "much of our knowledge of these properties for the disks is acquired through the study of local stellar samples ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bensby et al . 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fuhrmann 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reddy et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "the stellar sample studied here lies along the line - of - sight towards the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy , located at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . along this line - of - sight the milky way disk stars are approximately at the same galactocentric distance as the sun .",
    "this means that we are fairly insensitive to any radial gradients that might exist in the disk , and can assume that any gradients found are basically due to changes in the properties of the stellar populations in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "this study uses the strmgren photometric system which is made up of four intermediate band filters ( @xmath3 ) that are strategically located so that information can be obtained about the amount of line blanketing and the size of the balmer jump .",
    "* strmgren ( 1963 ) ) devised two indices , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , that measures these effects .",
    "while the @xmath4 index is metallicity sensitive , the @xmath5 index is sensitive to surface gravity and we use it to separate distant giant stars , belonging to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy , from galactic dwarf stars and sub - giant stars , belonging to the thin disk , thick disk , and halo , respectively .",
    "the observations were obtained with the isaac newton telescope on lapalma using the wide field camera .",
    "observations were taken both of the centre and the outskirts of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "after carefully separating the background members of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy from the foreground dwarf stars and sub - giant stars we present here results based on the properties of 749 galactic dwarf and sub - giant stars with @xmath6 . for these stars",
    "we have determined both distances and metallicities based on strmgren photometry .",

    "range the errors in the derived metallicities are below @xmath9 dex .",
    "the line - of - sight toward the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been observed as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) so @xmath10 photometry is available for our sample of stars .",
    "we have estimated the completeness of our photometry using the sdss survey , and base our magnitude cut on that completeness estimate .",
    "the distance modulii of individual stars were determined using @xmath10 apparent magnitudes and absolute magnitudes estimated using the isochrones of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi et al . ( 2004 ) ) . for stars near the turnoff we calculated a @xmath11 using our own calibration ( (",
    "* rnadttir et al . , in prep ) ) .",

    "* karaali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) was tested but it clearly is not able to derive the metallicities for the dwarf stars under consideration here and can therefore not be used for a larger investigation of the dwarf star properties in the disk based on @xmath10 photometry .",
    "additionally , there is very little overlap between this study and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey .",
    "only 4 stars were found in common between the two .",
    "we present the metallicity distribution functions at 0.5 kpc and 2.0 kpc above the galactic plane , fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . at both heights",
    "we see a broad distribution of metallicities .",
    "the observed distributions are not well reproduced by the besanon model of the galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( robin et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "the predicted metallicity distribution from the besanon model is narrower and at 0.5 kpc above the galactic plane it is more peaked towards solar metallicities and the model predicts that 80% of the stars are contributed from the thin disk and 20% of the stars are from the thick disk . at 2.0 kpc above the galactic plane",
    "the predicted metallicity distribution from the besanon model is also narrower than the observed one , and peaks at lower metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath12 . here",
    "the model predicts that 89% of the stars are thick disk stars with only 7% contribution from the thin disk and 4% from the halo .    in summary ,",
    "our data show broader metallicity distribution functions than the besanon model and our data also peaks at higher metallicities than the model does .",
    "can we reconcile our data with a realistic model of the milky way disk system ?",
    "one thing that is not too well constrained in the literature are the scale heights of the thin and the thick disks and the local normalisation of the stellar population densities .",
    "the thin disk scale height is determined to be between 220 pc and 330 pc ( see i.e. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* du et al . ( 2006 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chen et al . ( 2001 ) ) ) .",
    "the thick disk scale height , varying between 580 pc and 1600 pc , and its local normalisation , varying between 1% and 13% , are even more unconstrained . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we have compiled a collection of thick disk scale heights and local normalisations from the literature .",
    "there is a large range of acceptable values . the besanon model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( robin et al . 2003 ) ) has a thick disk scale height of 800 pc and a local normalisation of 6.8% .    using a toy model where each stellar population , i.e. thin disk , thick disk and halo , is represented by a single age and single metallicity we varied the scale heights of the thin and the thick disk and the local normalisation .",
    "this enabled us to study the contribution from stars ( @xmath13 ) of each population to the metallicity distribution at 0.5 kpc and 2.0 kpc above the plane , and qualitatively compare it to the observed metallicity distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "we tested several combinations of thin and thick disk scale heights and local normalisation from the literature ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "the observed broad metallicity distributions , fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , suggest that the contribution from the thin and the thick disk are much closer to 50 - 50% than the model predicts . at this stage",
    "our comparison can only be qualitative .",
    "however , we believe that the results will indeed hold up also with the more detailed modelling that we are now undertaking .",
    "our preliminary results from this simple modelling is that a thin disk scale height of @xmath14 pc , a thick disk scale height of @xmath15 pc , and a local normalisation of @xmath16% appear to explain our data .",
    "this combination of scale heights is advocated by recent studies such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chen et al . ( 2001 ) ) , which is based on star counts in 279 deg@xmath17 in the sdss survey , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* du et al . ( 2006 ) ) , which are based on star counts in 21 fields of 1 deg@xmath17 in the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) survey . in order to try to assess whether the observed line - of - sight is representative for the milky way disk system we queried the sdss for stars in eleven fields in the northern galactic hemisphere with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( including one field centred on the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy ) .",
    "we systematically compared colour magnitude diagrams and the colour distributions in these fields to the results from the besanon model .",
    "we find that in each field and in the magnitude range @xmath13 the turn - off stars in the besanon model are systematically bluer and overproduced as compared to the sdss data . in this magnitude range",
    "we are , in the bluest part of the colour distribution , looking at the thick disk turn - off stars at @xmath20 kpc above the galactic plane . the observed overproduction is in accordance with our previous indications that the true scale height of the thick disk is thinner than that used by the besanon model .    since this effect",
    "is observed systematically along several lines - of - sight we conclude that the line - of - sight towards the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy is not unique and conclusions drawn here about the thick and thin disk scale heights from the metallicity distributions along that line - of - sight are of a more general nature and can be applied to the milky way as a whole .",
    "we are able to study the turnoff colour as a function of height above the galactic plane , enabling us to measure the age of the population and their metallicities as a function of height . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] we show the colour distribution of dwarf stars at different heights above the galactic plane .",
