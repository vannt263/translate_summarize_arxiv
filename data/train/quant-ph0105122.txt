    "a most profound concept in quantum mechanics is coherent superposition of quantum states .",
    "this is obviously reflected by the special interference of two or more `` paths '' in terms of single particle wave function .",
    "however , this coherence phenomenon does not sound very marvelous for the same circumstances can also occur in classical case , such as an optical interference . to manifest the intrinsically quantum features of coherence beyond the classical analogue , glauber s higher order quantum correlation function ( hoqcf ) was introduced [ 1 ] to accounts for such higher order quantum coherence effect in the hanbury - brown - twiss experiment [ 2 ] .",
    "the quantum coherence both in the first order version and its higher order one shows the embodying of the wave nature in the world of the microscopic particles , but it is not robust due to the wave function collapse or quantum decoherence caused by a quantum measurement or by the coupling environment .",
    "roughly , in the single particle picture , this decoherence phenomenon losing coherence can be understood according to the quantum entanglement of the considered system with the environment or the measuring apparatus .",
    "obviously , this entanglement implies a `` which - path '' detection[3 ] .",
    "precisely speaking , in a initial coherent superposition @xmath0 , each system state @xmath1 corresponding a `` path '' is correlated with an environment state @xmath2 to form an entangling state @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of the different states @xmath2 distinguish among the `` paths''of different @xmath1 .",
    "the interferences terms in @xmath4 can disappear when the environment state @xmath2 are very distinct , i.e. , each path is explicitly labelled @xmath5 .    for the first order decoherence , the above well - known explanation in terms of `` wich - path '' detection mechanism",
    "is more simple , but very profound .",
    "however , it is not obvious yet whether this mechanism can account for decoherence in the higher effects : this is because we do not exactly know what is the `` paths '' and the corresponding `` which - path '' detection in the high order version .",
    "more recently , we have touched the quantum decoherence problem in higher order case [ 4 ] . the concrete calculation motivated us to further consider the `` which - path '' picture for the higher order quantum decoherence . in this paper , for a boson system",
    "we introduce the concept of the multi - particle wave amplitude , whose norm square is just the high order correlation function . as an effective wave function",
    ", this multi - time amplitude can be shown to be a supposition of several components .",
    "when the environment or a apparatus entangles with them , the quantum decoherence occurs in the high order case dynamically .",
    "this decoherence process losing the higher order coherence can be explained as a generalized `` which - path '' measurement for the defined multi - particle paths .",
    "firstly , we start with considering the meaning of the `` path '' in the high order quantum correlation .",
    "the typical example of the higher order quantum coherence [ 5 ] is that the single - component state @xmath6 of the two independent photons with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 shows its quantum coherence in its second order quantum correlation function @xmath9 .",
    "it can just be written as of form of the norm square @xmath10 of the equivalent `` two - time wave function '' @xmath11 it was also called the biphoton wave packet for the photon field @xmath12 [ 6 ] . especially , we remark that @xmath13 is a coherent superposition of several `` probability amplitudes '' . this result can be promoted to the universal case with quantum systems of identical particles .    to see the main physical ideas implied by the above well - known result , without loss of the generality , we define a `` measuring '' operator of two modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ 4 ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the annihilation operators of the boson system .",
    "the generalized second order correlation function[5 ] @xmath19 can be understood in terms of the two `` paths '' picture from the initial state @xmath20 to the finial one @xmath21 :    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    from the above equivalent @xmath22-time - wave function , the third order correlation function is explicitly written down @xmath23 + \\\\ & & \\cos [ ( \\omega _ v-\\omega _ h)(t_3-t_1)]+\\cos [ ( \\omega _ v-\\omega _ h)(t_2-t_3 ) ] )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and shows the quantum interference in the time - domain .    from the above calculations for the second and third order quantum decoherence",
    ", the observation can be made that , for a specially - given initial states , a high order correlation function may be explicitly written down as the norm square of the equivalent multi - time - wave function , which is a coherent superposition of several complex components in associated with the generalized many - particle paths .",
    "it is pointed out that this kind of many - particle path is not a simple - product of single - particle paths and it can be determined by the concrete measurement .",
    "with the above introduced concept ofmany - particle path \" , we can discuss the higher order decoherence problem by considering the many - particle `` which -path '' measurement .",
    "let us use the following model to sketch this central idea .",
    "our model is consisted of non - dissipative bosons in two modes .",
    "the problem is studied via calculating the second order quantum correlation functions in the heisenberg picture .",
    "we take @xmath24 in this paper .    the model hamiltonian @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26(% \\hat{a}_j^{\\dagger } + \\hat{a}_j),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the free hamiltonian of the system , @xmath28 the free hamiltonian of the reservoir ( or a detector ) plus the interaction between the system and the reservoir ; and @xmath29 the creation ( annihilation ) operators for two modes with frequencies @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the operators @xmath32 are creation ( annihilation ) operators of the reservoir modes of frequencies @xmath33 .",
    "the frequency - dependent constant @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) measures the coupling constant between @xmath15(@xmath14 ) mode and the @xmath36 mode of the reservoir .",
    "the most important feature of the model is that @xmath37=0 $ ] , i.e. the system does not dissipate energy to the reservoir , but it can leave imprinting on the reservoir since , for different number states @xmath38 , there are different interactions @xmath39(\\hat{a}_j^{\\dagger } + \\hat{a}_j)$ ] acting on the oscillator reservoir with different driving forces @xmath40 .",
    "when there is only one mode in external system we can physically realized this model as an intracavity model[4,8 ] : two mode cavity field interact with a moving wall of the cavity , which is attached to a spring and can be regarded as a harmonic oscillator with a small mass .",
    "the coupling of fields to the cavity wall ( a moving mirror ) is just by the radiation pressure forces proportioned to the photon numbers by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the second order coherence is directly determined by the second order correlation .",
    "@xmath43=tr(\\hat{\\rho}(0)\\hat{b}^{\\dagger } ( t)\\hat{b}% ^{\\dagger } ( t^{\\prime } ) \\hat{b}(t^{\\prime } ) \\hat{b}(t)),\\ ] ] which is defined as a functional of the density operator @xmath44 of the whole system at a given time @xmath45 . here ,",
    "the bosonic field operator @xmath46\\exp ( -i\\hat{h}t)= \\\\ & & \\exp ( i\\hat{v}t)[c_1\\hat{b}_h+c_2\\hat{b}_v\\exp ( -i\\omega _ vt)]\\exp ( -i\\hat{% v}t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes a specific quantum measurement[4 ] with respect the polarized photon states @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfy the normalization relation @xmath55 . without loss of the generality , we take @xmath56 standing for a given measurement as follows .",
    "to examine whether the macroscopic feature of the reservoir causes the second order decoherence or not , we consider the whole system in an initial state @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vacuum state of the reservoir . here , we have denoted the general fock states of the many mode field by @xmath59 .    for the total system , in stead of defining the equivalent `` two - time wave function '' in the above section ,",
    "we define an effective two - time state vector @xmath60 to re - write the second order correlation function as @xmath43=\\langle \\psi _ b(t , t^{\\prime } ) |\\psi _ b(t , t^{\\prime } ) \\rangle\\ ] ] it is interested that the effective state vector can be evaluated as the superposition @xmath61e^{-i\\hat{v}(1,1)t}|\\{0_j\\}\\rangle \\otimes    the initial two particle state @xmath62 .",
    "it should be noticed that the effective actions of the reservoir @xmath63 can label the different paths and thus lead to the higher order quantum decoherence .",
    "the above result clearly demonstrates that , in presence of the reservoir , the different probability amplitudes ( @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) of the reservoir .",
    "this is just physical source of the higher order quantum decoherence . in the following section an explicit calculation of the second order correlation function",
    "will be given to show this crucial observation .",
    "in our calculation , the second order correlation function @xmath43=\\frac 12+\\frac 14e^{i\\omega _ v(t - t^{\\prime } ) } \\prod_jf_j+\\frac 14e^{-i\\omega _ v(t - t^{\\prime } ) } \\prod_jf_j^{*},\\ ] ] is firstly expressed as a factorization form[9 ] where each factor @xmath70 is a two - time transition amplitude of the @xmath71 mode of the reservoir .",
    "obviously , the term @xmath72 determines the extent of coherence and decoherence in the second order case , which is called `` the decoherence factor '' and plays the role just as the same as that in the first order decoherence[9 ] .    in the following , to given the factor @xmath73 explicitly , we adopt the wei - norman method [ 10,11 ] to calculate the equivalent time evolution defined by @xmath74",
    ". it can be image as an evolution governed by a discrete time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath75 dominated by @xmath76 and @xmath77 in six time - intervals @xmath78,[t_1,t_2=2t],[t_2,t_3=2t+t^{\\prime } ] , [ t_3,t_4=2t+2t^{\\prime } ] , [ t_4,t_5=3t+2t^{\\prime } ] , $ ] @xmath79 $ ] respectively . in the @xmath7-th step of calculation",
    ", we take the final state of ( @xmath80-th step as its initial state .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath74 as the sixth step evolution      here , @xmath82 are the coefficients that can be explicitly obtained , but for the calculation of the @xmath36-th component @xmath83 $ ] of the decoherence factor@xmath84 we only need to know @xmath85 the detailed discussion in the appendix gives    @xmath86 ^ 2}{\\omega _",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the real part of @xmath87 is no more than zero , the norm of @xmath73 is no more than one . from the same argument as in the first order decoherence [ 9 ] , the universal factorization structure of the decoherence factor implies the second order decoherence in the macroscopic limit .    in order to demonstrate the above arguments quantitatively , we give the numerical results for the second order decoherence for different numbers",
    "n of the quantum oscillators . as n increase ,",
    "these results are illustrated in fig.1 . in the numerical calculation ,",
    "the coupling constants @xmath88 take random values in the domain @xmath89 $ ] , the coupling constants @xmath90 in @xmath91 $ ] , and the frequencies @xmath92 in @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the other parameters is given in the caption of the figure .",
    "0.2 cm        from the above illustration , we see clearly that the second order correlation is not only a function of the time period @xmath94 , but also a function of time @xmath95 .",
    "the amplitude of the second order correlation function is mainly determined by the time period , but the phase is determined by the two parameters in the same time .",
    "more important , with the increasing of the number of the quantum oscillators , the second order coherence vanishes faster and faster , and the quantum revival amplitude becomes smaller . with extrapolation",
    ", it can be expected that , when the number of the quantum oscillators limit to infinity , i.e. , in the macroscopic limit of the reservoir , the second order coherence will decoherence in a short time and no quantum revival can be observed .      in this appendix ,",
    "the wei - norman method [ 10,11 ] is adopted to calculate the second order decoherence factor @xmath73 .",
    "the calculation is completed in six steps . during the time period @xmath96 $ ] , the evolution for @xmath97 is dominated by the hamiltonian @xmath98 the coefficients @xmath99 and the times intervals @xmath100 take different values in different steps : @xmath101 due to the fact that @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 form a closed algebra - the heisenberg - wely algebra , the unitary time evolution operator at every step takes the following form @xmath106 for @xmath107 $ ] in a special sequence .",
    "the benefit of the above form is that only the coefficient @xmath108 is needed to be known in the calculation of the average value of the vacuum state .",
    "according to the schr@xmath109dinger equation @xmath110 , the coefficients satisfy the equations : @xmath111 using the results @xmath112 obtained by simplifying the system of equations , we get the solution @xmath113 notice that we have used the step - initial conditions @xmath114 and the initial conditions @xmath115 .",
