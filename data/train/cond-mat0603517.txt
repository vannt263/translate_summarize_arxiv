    "phase transitions and critical phenomena in open nonequilibrium statistical systems have attracted a great deal of interest in recent decades , due to their wide applications in many branches of physics , chemistry , biology , economics , and even sociology @xcite . among these",
    ", surface reaction models have become the archetype to study out - of - equilibrium critical phenomena , and they have been intensely analyzed with the purpose of designing more efficient catalytic processes @xcite .",
    "the ziff , gulari , barshad ( zgb ) model @xcite with desorption ( zgb - k ) @xcite describes some kinetic aspects of the reaction co+o@xmath0",
    "@xmath1 co@xmath0 on a catalytic surface in terms of two parameters : the partial pressure of co , @xmath2 , which represents the probability per unit of time that the next molecule arriving at the surface is a co , and the desorption parameter , @xmath3 , which gives the probability per unit of time that a site occupied by a co molecule is vacated .",
    "below a critical co desorption rate , the model exhibits a first - order phase transition between low and high coverage phases @xcite .",
    "a study of the metastable lifetimes associated with the transition between these phases indicates that the decay mechanism is very similar to the decay of metastable phases associated with equilibrium first - order phase transitions and can be described by the classic kolmorogov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) theory @xcite of phase transformations by nucleation and growth @xcite . near the coexistence line between the active and the co poisoned phase ,",
    "the decay times of the metastable state are different if the zgb - k model is driven into the active phase from the co poisoned state or vice versa @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry of the lifetimes , together with studies that indicate that it is possible to increase the efficiency of catalytic reactions by forcing the system by a periodic external pressure that switches back and forth around the discontinuous transition @xcite , inspired us to subject the system to a square - wave periodic co pressure that stays for a time @xmath4 in the high - production region and @xmath5 in the low - production region .",
    "we showed that @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be tuned to significantly enhance the time - averaged catalytic activity of the system @xcite .",
    "many experiments indicate that at intermediate and high temperatures adsorbed co is fairly mobile , while oxygen is still relatively immobile  @xcite . in this work we aim at a more realistic process by incorporating co diffusion into the zgb - k model . the model that includes co",
    "desorption and diffusion will be denoted the zgb-(k , d ) model .",
    "we investigate how the diffusion process affects the first - order kinetic phase transition and the response of the system to a periodic variation of the co pressure .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we define the model and describe the monte carlo simulation techniques used . in sec .",
    "iii we present and discuss the results obtained when subjecting the model to a periodic external co pressure .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "the zgb-(k , d ) model is simulated on a square lattice of linear size @xmath6 that represents the catalyst surface .",
    "a monte carlo simulation generates a sequence of trials : co diffusion with probability per unit of time @xmath7 , and adsorption or desorption with @xmath8 . in nature",
    ", the diffusion process occurs more frequently than the adsorption / desorption process , so that @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the chemical processes include co or o@xmath0 adsorption with probability per unit of time @xmath10 , and co desorption with probability per unit of time @xmath3 .",
    "for the adsorption , a co or o@xmath0 molecule is selected with probability per unit of time @xmath2 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the algorithm works in the following way .",
    "a site @xmath12 is selected at random . in the case of co diffusion ,",
    "if @xmath12 is empty or occupied by an o atom , the trial ends .",
    "otherwise , a nearest neighbor of @xmath12 is selected at random ; if it is vacant , the co molecule exchanges with it , and reacts if any of its nearest - neighbors is an o atom , producing a co@xmath0 molecule and leaving two empty sites on the surface . in the case of desorption , if @xmath12 is occupied by a co , the site @xmath12 is vacated and the trial ends ; if not , the trial also ends . in the case of adsorption ,",
    "if a co molecule is selected it can be adsorbed at the empty site @xmath12 if none of its nearest neighbors are occupied by an o atom .",
    "otherwise , one of the occupied o neighbors is selected at random and removed from the surface , leaving @xmath12 and the selected neighbor vacant .",
    "o@xmath0 molecules require a nearest - neighbor pair of vacant sites to adsorb . once the o@xmath0 molecule is adsorbed , it is dissociated into two o atoms .",
    "if an o atom is located next to a site filled with a co molecule , they react to form a co@xmath0 molecule that escapes , leaving two sites vacant .",
    "this process simulates the co @xmath13 o @xmath1 co@xmath0 surface reaction .",
    "since the diffusion is much faster than the other chemical processes , we will assume that the diffusion does not slow down the time scale for adsorption / desorption , which is the physically relevant time scale for the phase transformation @xcite .",
    "thus , we define the time unit as one monte carlo step per site , mcss , in which the system performs , on average , one adsorption / desorption attempt per site .",
    "our simulations are realized on a square lattice of @xmath14 sites , assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we calculate the coverages @xmath15 and @xmath16 , defined as the fraction of surface sites occupied by co and o , respectively , and @xmath17 defined as the rate of production of co@xmath18 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show , for a particular value of @xmath3 and @xmath7 , the dependence of the average values of the coverages and the production rate : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively , for an external constant co pressure @xmath2 .",
    "there are two inactive regions , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 appears to be fairly independent of @xmath3 and @xmath7 @xcite ) , and @xmath24 .",
    "these correspond to the cases in which the surface is saturated with o and co , respectively . in between , for @xmath25 , there is an active window where the system produces co@xmath18 .",
    "notice that the maximum value of @xmath21 is reached as @xmath26 is approached from the low-@xmath27 phase . fig .  [",
    "fig1](b ) shows that the effect of the co diffusion is to widen the range of values of @xmath2 for which there is catalytic activity , producing a significant increase of the maximum co@xmath0 production rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the coexistence point , @xmath28 , as a function of @xmath3 for several values of @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of the diffusion is to shift the transition to higher values of @xmath28 , while maintaining approximately the same dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath3 that is observed at @xmath29 .",
    "next , we perturb the system by applying an oscillating pressure @xmath30 that in a period @xmath31 takes the values , @xmath32 located at both sides of the transition point , i.e. , @xmath33 ( see fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "we found that , for each choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we can vary the productivity of the system by tuning @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the times that the driving force spends in the high and low coverage regions , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) it can be seen that the response to the periodic pressure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the co@xmath0 production rate @xmath38 , also exhibits an oscillatory behavior .",
    "we define the period - averaged value of @xmath38 , @xmath39 as the dynamic order parameter . for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( selected after an exhaustive search looking for the maximum productivity ) the long - time average of @xmath40 , @xmath41 is almost the same as the maximum average co@xmath0 production rate for constant @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the zgb - k model shows a marked enhancement of the catalytic activity when subjected to this type of periodic perturbation @xcite .",
    "we think that this significant difference may possibly be due to the fact that the diffusion term modifies the decay mechanisms of the system near the transition .",
    "previous studies in a lattice - gas model near an equilibrium first - order phase transition show that at high diffusion rates the nucleation no longer can be described by the classical kjma theory @xcite .",
    "the fact that applying a periodic co pressure to the system with diffusion , does not seem to increase the co@xmath0 production further , may indicate that the optimal mixing of co and o on the surface was already reached by the inclusion of diffusion .    depending on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the system behavior defines two regions : a productive one with @xmath42 , and a non - productive one with @xmath43 , separated by a coexistence curve . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show a density plot of the average productivity @xmath41 in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a particular choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the highest productivity is reached close to the coexistence curve .",
    "the plot suggests , as is also the case in the zgb - k model @xcite , the existence of a dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) , where the period - averaged order parameter @xmath40 takes the value @xmath43 or @xmath42 depending on whether the system is in a nonproductive state or in a productive one .",
    "a more detailed study of the nature of the transition , based on a finite - size scaling analysis of the fluctuations of the order parameter , is in progress and will be published elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we have studied the zgb model with co desorption and diffusion , the zgb-(k , d ) model , and its dynamic response to periodic variations of the partial co pressure .",
    "we found that , like the model without diffusion ( zgb - k ) , this system exhibits a non - equilibrium discontinuous phase transition between low and high co coverage phases .",
    "the transition occurs at a @xmath3-dependent value of the co pressure @xmath28 .",
    "the effect of the diffusion term is to shift the transition to a higher pressure , such that @xmath44 , and to produce a significant increase of the maximum co@xmath0 production rate .",
    "we further subjected the system to a square - wave periodic co pressure that switches back and forth around the coexistence value that separates the low and high co - coverage phases , staying for a time @xmath4 in the high - production region and for a time @xmath5 in the low production one .",
    "we found that @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be tuned to vary the catalytic activity of the system .",
    "however , contrary to the case of the zgb - k model , the increase in the production of co@xmath0 obtained in this way is negligible .",
    "we believe that this result indicates that the decay mechanisms of the metastable phase may be strongly affected by the diffusion process .",
    "we also found indications that this driven nonequilibrium system could have a dynamic phase transition between a dynamic phase of high co@xmath0 production and a nonproductive phase . a more detailed study that includes",
    "the application of finite - size scaling techniques is necessary to establish the full details of the transition .",
