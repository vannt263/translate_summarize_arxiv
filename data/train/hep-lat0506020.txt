    "quantum electrodynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions ( qed@xmath0 ) is interesting as a toy model for investigating the mechanism of confinement in gauge theories  @xcite , and as an effective description of low - dimensional , correlated , electronic condensed matter systems , like spin systems  @xcite , or high-@xmath1 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "while the compact formulation of qed@xmath0 appears to be more suitable for studying the mechanism of confinement , both compact  @xcite and noncompact formulations arise in condensed matter systems .",
    "our paper aims to elucidate some aspects of the relationship between these two formulations of qed@xmath0 on the lattice .",
    "polyakov showed that compact qed@xmath0 without fermion degrees of freedom is always confining  @xcite .",
    "any pair of test electric charge and anti - charge is confined by a linear potential , as an effect of proliferation of instantons , which are magnetic monopole solutions in three dimensions .",
    "the plasma of such monopoles is what is responsible for confinement of electrically charged particles .",
    "if compact qed@xmath0 is coupled to matter fields it has been argued  @xcite that the interaction between monopoles could turn from @xmath2 to @xmath3 at large distances @xmath4 , so that the deconfined phase may become stable at low temperature .",
    "the issue of the existence of a confinement - deconfinement transition in qed@xmath0 at @xmath5 is still controversial , as it has also been proposed that compact qed@xmath0 with massless fermions is always in the confined phase  @xcite ; also , in the limit of large flavor number , it has been argued that monopoles should not play any role in the confinement mechanism  @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "parity invariant qed@xmath0 coupled with fermionic matter undergoes a berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless transition to a deconfined phase  @xcite .",
    "the issue of charge confinement in @xmath6 dimensional gauge models comes out to be relevant in the context of quantum phase transitions , as well .",
    "indeed , recently it has been proposed that phenomena similar to deconfinement in high energy physics might appear in planar correlated systems , driven to a quantum ( that is , zero - temperature ) phase transition between an antiferromagnetically ordered ( nel ) phase , and a phase with no order by continuous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the most suitable candidate for a theoretical description of the system near the quantum critical point is a planar gauge theory , either with fermionic matter  @xcite , or with bosonic matter  @xcite .    at finite @xmath7 noncompact qed@xmath0",
    "comes about to be relevant in the analysis of the pseudo gap phase  @xcite of cuprates .",
    "this phase arises from the fact that , upon doping the cuprate , a gap opens at some temperature @xmath8 which is quite larger than the critical temperature @xmath9 for the onset of superconductivity . both temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath9 are doping dependent quantities and the gap is strongly dependent upon the direction in momentum space , since it exhibits @xmath10-wave symmetry  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] we report the phase diagram of high-@xmath1 cuprates . for small-@xmath4 phase",
    "is characterized  @xcite by an insulating antiferromagnet ( af ) ; by increasing @xmath4 , this phase evolves into a spin density wave ( sdw ) , that is a weak antiferromagnet .",
    "the pseudo gap phase is located between this phase and the @xmath10-wave superconducting ( dsc ) one .    the effective theory of the pseudo gap phase  @xcite turns out to be qed@xmath0  @xcite , with spatial anisotropies in the covariant derivatives , that is with different values for the fermi and the gap velocities  @xcite , and with fermionic matter given by spin-@xmath11 chargeless excitations of the superconducting state ( spinons ) .",
    "these excitations are minimally coupled to a massless gauge field , which arises from the fluctuating topological defects in the superconducting phase .",
    "the sdw order parameter is identified with the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the gauge theory , that is , @xmath12",
    "there can be two possibilities ; if @xmath13 is different from zero , then the @xmath10-wave superconducting phase is connected to the spin density wave one ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] case b ) ; otherwise the two phases are separated at @xmath5 by the pseudo gap phase ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] case a ) .",
    "confinement and chiral symmetry breaking go essentially together as strong coupling phenomena in gauge theories ; while confinement is an observed property of the strong interactions and it is an unproven , but widely believed feature of non - abelian gauge theories in four space - time dimensions , chiral symmetry is only an approximate symmetry of particle physics , since the up and down quarks are light but not massless .",
    "central to our understanding of csb is the existence of a critical coupling : when fermions have a sufficiently strong attractive interaction there is a pairing instability and the ensuing condensate breaks some of the flavor symmetries , generate quark masses , and represents chiral symmetry in the nambu - goldstone mode  @xcite .",
    "the issue of a critical coupling has been widely investigated in 2 + 1 dimensional gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "typically , the dimensionless expansion parameter is @xmath14 . using the schwinger - dyson equations  @xcite or a current algebra approach  @xcite for qed@xmath0 and qcd@xmath0",
    "one finds that there is a critical number of flavors , @xmath15 , such that only for @xmath16 lesser than @xmath15 chiral symmetry is broken ; for @xmath16 bigger than @xmath15 chirality is unbroken and quarks remain massless . for qed@xmath0",
    "this result has been the subject of some debate  @xcite ; there are , however , numerical simulations  @xcite of qed@xmath0 , which find an @xmath15 remarkably close to the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even if far from the scaling regime , strong coupling gauge theories on the lattice provide interesting clues on the issue of csb .",
    "in fact , one can show that , in the strong coupling limit , a hamiltonian with @xmath17 colors of fermions and @xmath18 lattice flavors of staggered fermions is effectively a @xmath19 quantum antiferromagnet with representations determined by @xmath17 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "csb is then associated  @xcite either to the formation of a @xmath20 commensurate charge density wave or of a @xmath21 spin density wave , i.e. to the formation of nel order .",

    "one may define three @xmath31 dirac matrices @xmath32 @xmath33 and two more matrices anticommuting with them : namely @xmath34 the massless theory will therefore be invariant under the chiral transformations @xmath35 if one writes a 4-component spinor as @xmath36 the mass term becomes @xmath37 since in three dimensions the parity transformation reads @xmath38 then @xmath39 is parity conserving .",

    "monopoles are detected in the lattice using the method given by degrand and toussaint  @xcite : due to the gauss s law , the total magnetic flux emanating from a closed surface allows to determine if the surface encloses a monopole .",
    "the monopole density is defined by half of the total number of monopoles and antimonopoles divided by the number of elementary cubes in the lattice .",
    "we apply this definition for both the compact and the noncompact formulations of the theory , although some caution should be used in this respect .",
    "indeed , monopoles are classical solutions of the theory with finite action only for compact qed@xmath0 , where they are known to play a relevant role . in the noncompact formulation of qed@xmath0",
    "they are not classical solutions , but they could give a contribution to the feynman path integral owing to the periodic structure of the fermionic sector  @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the onset of the continuum physics , it is convenient to consider a dimensionless observable and to evaluate it from the lattice for increasing @xmath56 until it reaches a plateau .",
    "such an observable can be taken to be @xmath57 , which is expected to become constant in the continuum ( @xmath58 ) limit  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show two regimes : for @xmath56 larger than a certain value , the theory is in the continuum limit ( flat dependence of a dimensionless observable from @xmath56 ) , otherwise the system is in a phase with finite lattice spacing . in the former regime ,",
    "the theory describes continuum physics , in the latter one it is appropriate to describe a lattice condensed - matter - like system .",
    "there are a couple of papers by fiebig and woloshyn in which the two formulations are compared in the finite lattice regime  @xcite . in these papers",
    "the @xmath56-dependence of the chiral condensate and of the monopole density for lattice qed@xmath0 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 are analyzed for both compact and noncompact formulations in the finite lattice regime .     and",
    "@xmath61 for the compact ( circles ) and the noncompact ( boxes ) theories for @xmath60 and @xmath62 lattice according to ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    it is shown there that , when @xmath63 is plotted versus the monopole density @xmath61 , data points for both theories fall on the same curve to a good approximation ( see fig .  [ fie_wol ] ) .",
    "this led the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite to the conclusion that the physics of the chiral symmetry breaking is the same in the two theories .",
    "our program is to study if the conclusion reached by fiebig and woloshyn can be extended to the continuum limit , by looking at the same observables they considered : namely the chiral condensate and the monopole density .",
    "since qed@xmath0 is a super - renormalizable theory , the coupling constant does not display any lattice space dependence .",
    "the continuum limit is approached by merely sending @xmath49 to infinity . in this limit",
    "all physical quantities can be expressed in units of the scale set by the coupling @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to work in terms of dimensionless variables such as @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 , which depend on @xmath64 ( @xmath68 is the lattice size ) .",
    "the signature that the continuum limit is approached is that data taken at different @xmath56 should overlap on a single curve when plotted in dimensionless units  @xcite .    in practice",
    ", numerical results will not describe the correct physics of the system even in the continuum limit because of finite volume effects which are particularly significant in our case , due to the presence of a massless particle , the photon . in principle one",
    "should get rid of these effects by taking @xmath69 . in practice , this ratio is taken to be large , but finite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors conclude that in order to find chiral symmetry breaking for @xmath60 at least a ratio @xmath70 is required . in our simulations the largest value for the @xmath66 ratio has been 20 .    , according to our results.,width=321 ]    our monte carlo simulation code was based on the hybrid updating algorithm , with a microcanonical time step set to @xmath71 .",
    "we simulated one flavour of staggered fermions corresponding to two flavours of 4-component fermions .",
    "most simulations were performed on a @xmath72 lattice , for bare quark mass ranging in the interval @xmath73 .",
    "we made refreshments of the gauge ( pseudofermion ) fields every 7 ( 13 ) steps of the molecular dynamics . in order to reduce autocorrelation effects",
    ", `` measurements '' were taken every 50 steps .",
    "data were analyzed by the jackknife method combined with binning .     versus @xmath65 in the compact formulation.,width=321 ]    as a first step , we have reproduced the results by fiebig and woloshyn which are shown in fig .  [ fie_wol ] .",
    "we find that also in our case data points from the two formulations nicely overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ ours ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that data of fig .",
    "[ fie_wol ] were obtained using a linear fit with two masses ( @xmath74=0.025 , 0.05 ) whilst those of fig .",
    "[ ours ] have been obtained by a quadratic fit with four masses ( @xmath74=0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 ) , nevertheless the conclusion is the same in both cases .",
    "we have verified that if we perform a linear fit on the subset of our data with masses @xmath74=0.02 and 0.05 and on the subset with masses @xmath74=0.03 and 0.05 , our results nicely compare with those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fie_wol ] .",
    "then , in fig",
    ".  [ cond_comp ] we plot data for @xmath57 obtained in the compact formulation versus @xmath65 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the subset of @xmath56 values for which data points fall approximately on the same curve , which in the present case means @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 . a linear fit of these data points gives @xmath77/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath78 and the extrapolated value for @xmath79 turns out to be @xmath80 . restricting the sample to the data at @xmath81 , the @xmath82d.o.f . lowers to @xmath83 and the extrapolated value becomes @xmath84 , thus showing that there is a strong instability in the determination of the chiral limit . if instead a quadratic fit is used for the points obtained with @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 with @xmath77/d.o.f .",
    "owing to the large uncertainty , this determination turns out to be compatible with both the previous ones .     versus @xmath65 in the noncompact formulation.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ cond_noncomp ] we plot data for @xmath67 obtained in the noncompact formulation versus @xmath65 . following the same strategy outlined before , we restrict our analysis to the data obtained with @xmath88 , which correspond to @xmath89 .",

    "value @xmath94 , we obtain the extrapolated value @xmath95 . therefore , also in the noncompact formulation the chiral extrapolation resulting from a linear fit is largely unstable .",
    "a quadratic fit in this case gives instead a negative value for @xmath96 .",
    "the comparison of the extrapolated value for @xmath96 in the two formulations is difficult owing to the instabilities of the fits and to the low reliability of the linear fits , as suggested by the large values of the @xmath82d.o.f .",
    "taking an optimistic point of view , one could say that the extrapolated @xmath96 for @xmath81 in the compact formulation is compatible with the extrapolated value obtained in the noncompact formulation for @xmath93 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our results in the noncompact formulation are consistent with known results : indeed , if we carry out a linear fit of the data for @xmath97 and @xmath74=0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 and extrapolate , we get @xmath98 with an admittedly large @xmath82d.o.f .",
    "@xmath99 , but very much in agreement with the value @xmath100 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we stress again that our results are plagued by strong finite volume effects , therefore our conclusions on the extrapolated values of @xmath96 are significant only in the compact versus noncompact comparison we are interested in .",
    "we do not even try to draw any conclusion from our data on the critical number of the flavours . as a matter of fact a recent paper  @xcite shows that , if effects are carefully monitored and large lattices , up to @xmath101 , are used , it is possible to establish that @xmath102 . for the comparison between compact and noncompact qed@xmath0 it is pertinent to carry out the numerical analysis with an ( approximately ) constant value of the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "this condition is indeed verified even if we performed simulations on lattices with fixed ( @xmath103 ) size , since the range of allowed values for @xmath56 corresponding to the continuum limit is narrow ( @xmath104 in the compact case , @xmath105 in the noncompact case ) .",
    "finite volume effects play a `` second order '' role in our work , since they probably only affect the extension of the continuum limit window of @xmath56 values .     versus @xmath61 in both the compact and the noncompact formulations on a @xmath72 lattice.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ cond_vs_rho ] we plot @xmath106 versus the monopole density @xmath61 . differently from figs .",
    "[ fie_wol]-[ours ] , it is not evident with the present results that the two formulations are equivalent also in the continuum limit , although such an equivalence can not yet be excluded .     versus @xmath61 in both the compact and the noncompact formulations on a @xmath107 lattice.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ cond_vs_rho_2 ] we plot again @xmath106 versus the monopole density @xmath61 , but now on a @xmath107 lattice . in this case",
    "the chiral condensate is extrapolated to zero mass by a quadratic fit . in spite of",
    "the negative value taken by @xmath106 for large @xmath56 , in this case data for both formulations seem to fall on the same curve .     versus @xmath65 in the compact formulation.,width=321 ]     versus @xmath65 in the noncompact formulation.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ rho_comp ] and fig .",
    "[ rho_noncomp ] we plot @xmath108 versus @xmath65 for the two formulations ; the former quantity is dimensionless , therefore , in analogy with the previous cases , we expect that data at different @xmath56 values should fall on a single curve in the continuum limit .",
    "our results show that this is not the case , this suggesting that the continuum limit has not been reached for the monopole density .",
    "simulations on the @xmath107 lattice give practically the same results for @xmath108 , indicating that this observable , unlike @xmath96 , is volume independent .",
    "it is important to observe , however , that the monopole density is independent of the fermion mass . since the mechanism of confinement in the theory with infinitely massive fermions , i.e. in the pure gauge theory ,",
    "is based on monopoles and since the monopole density is not affected by the fermion mass , we may conjecture that this same mechanism holds also in the chiral limit .",
    "this supports the arguments by herbut about the confinement in the presence of massless fermion  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have compared the compact and the noncompact formulations of qed@xmath0 by looking at the behavior of the chiral condensate and the monopole density .",
    "numerical results for @xmath67 are compatible with those obtained by other groups , although it is still questionable if the continuum limit has been reached and if the chiral limit is stable .",
    "the biggest difficulty for this observable is that the chiral extrapolation is rough when a linear fit is performed , but gives a negative value when instead a quadratic fit is considered .",
    "massive calculations on larger lattices are needed to further reduce the finite volume effects and to stabilize the chiral limit .    as far as monopoles are concerned , they appear in smaller and smaller numbers for large @xmath56 , this making the determination of the continuum limit for @xmath108 rather problematic .",
    "our results show , however , a very weak volume dependence .",
    "we have analyzed also the relationship between the monopole density and the fermion mass , both in compact and noncompact qed@xmath0 .",
    "the weak dependence observed leads us to conclude that the polyakov mechanism for confinement holds not only in the pure gauge theory , but also in presence of massless fermions .",
    "finally , we note that , although the chiral condensate and monopole density approach the continuum limit in two different ranges of @xmath56 , the analysis _  la _ `` fiebig and woloshin '' does not allow to exclude the equivalence of the compact and noncompact lattice formulations of qed@xmath0 .",
