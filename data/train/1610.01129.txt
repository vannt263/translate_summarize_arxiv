    "in astrophysics , the accretion of fluids or matter onto compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes , is an interesting physical process as it describes a scenario which is most likely to explain the high energy output from the active galactic nuclei and quasars .",
    "accretion is the process of capturing the matter by a gravitating object towards its center which leads to increase the mass and angular momentum of the accreting body .",
    "the stars and planets are formed by the process of accretion in dust clouds .",
    "the existence of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies suggests that such black holes could have been gradually developed through the accretion process .",
    "an accretion disk is developed when dust and gases rotate around a compact object and accumulate into a disk .",
    "however , accretion does not always increase the mass of the accreting body but it could also decrease the mass such as accretion of phantom energy @xcite .",
    "a unique feature of black hole is the presence of an event horizon which acts as a boundary through which infalling fluid disappears .",
    "this may have various implications .",
    "for instance , it provides the inner boundary condition which describes the motion of the fluid and further it helps to avoid the uncertainties regarding the correct boundary conditions .    in @xmath1 bondi investigated the accretion process for a star within the newtonian framework @xcite .",
    "after the evolution of the relativistic theory of gravitation given by einstein , it became possible for the astrophysicists to study the accretion process within the relativistic framework .",
    "so , michel was the first one , who investigated the accretion process onto the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "further , shapiro and teukolsky @xcite also contributed to michel s idea .",
    "later on , babichev et al.@xcite discussed the effect of accretion of a dark energy onto schwarzschild black hole and found that accretion of phantom energy will decrease the mass of the black hole .",
    "debnath @xcite further generalized the babichev s idea and presented a framework of a static accretion onto general static and spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "moreover in the series of recent papers @xcite accretion of a spherically symmetric spacetime with is investigated .",
    "the authors were mainly interested to determine that how the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath2 effects the accretion rate .    during the phase transition ,",
    "many topological defects are produced such as cosmic strings , domain walls , monopoles , etc .",
    "monopoles are the three - dimensional topological defects that are formed when the spherical symmetry is broken during the phase transition .",
    "these monopoles have goldstone fields with high energy density that decrease with the distance only as @xmath3 , so that the total energy density is divergent at the large distances @xcite .",
    "this large density suggests that global monopoles can produce the strong gravitational fields .",
    "another interesting point is that the spacetime around a cosmic string is conical globally but locally the spacetime is flat i.e. just a minkowski spacetime .",
    "so we can think about this spacetime as minkowski spacetime but , in case of a global monopole the spacetime is not locally flat . however , globally the spacetime at the equatorial plane is conical having deficit angle as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is evident that these monopoles exerts practically no gravitational force on non - relativistic matter but the space around it has a deficit solid angle and all the light rays are deflected by that angle , independent of the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the charged black holes do not exist in nature , since initial charge will be neutralized quickly @xcite . however ,",
    "these charged black holes may be produced during the gravitational collapse of massive stars particularly magnetized rotating stars surrounded by a magnetosphere having an equal and opposite charge .",
    "the magnetosphere preserves the black hole from a neutralization due to the accretion of charge , so that the black hole remains stable in a typical astrophysical environment having low density .",
    "barriola and vilenkin found the approximate solution of the einstein equations for the static spherically symmetric black hole with a global monopole @xcite .",
    "several other authors have also studied the physical properties of the black holes with global monopoles @xcite . in the absence of the electric charge @xmath5 and the cosmological constant @xmath2 , letelier @xcite obtained the metric representing the black hole spacetime with a spherical mass @xmath6 centered at the origin of the system of coordinates , surrounded by a spherical cloud of strings . the accretion process onto the black hole with a string cloud parameter , which can be interpreted as a global monopole , is examined by ganguly et al.@xcite .",
    "the circular geodesics and accretion disk of a black hole with global monopole is discussed by sun et al @xcite .",
    "recently , the accretion process of a charged black hole in the anti - de - sitter spacetime is investigated by ficek @xcite .",
    "the author calculated the analytical solutions for the isothermal and polytropic fluids and found a way to find sonic points as critical points of a hamiltonian system .",
    "he has also proved the existence of closed trajectories and therefore homoclinic solutions in the phase space of subrelativistic isothermal flows . here , we extend his idea by considering a global monopole charge @xmath0 , which is different from the electric charge @xmath5 in the black hole . in this paper",
    "we investigate the spherically symmetric , steady flow of the most general perfect fluid ( gas ) .",
    "the basic motivation comes from the fact that some features of reissner - nordstrm black hole resemble with the kerr solution as they both share the similar structure of horizons @xcite .",
    "the accretion dynamics for schwarzschild monopole de - sitter black hole with @xmath7 has already been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec ii we derive the metric ( line element ) for the reissner - nordstrm anti - de - sitter ( rn - ads ) black hole with global monopole charge . in sec",
    "iii a general formalism and conservation laws for the accretion process are derived .",
    "the speed of sound at the sonic ( critical ) point is evaluated in sec iv .",
    "next , we have assumed the isothermal equation of state and by choosing different values of state parameter the behaviour of flow for different cases such as ultra - stiff , ultra - relativistic , rotation and sub - relativistic fluids is analysed . in sec vi the general solutions for the polytropic equation of state are obtained as there exists no global ( bondi ) solutions for them .",
    "in the subsequent section , we have calculated the matter accretion rate of the black hole for the isothermal flow and finally we conclude our discussion .",
    "throughout we use the common relativistic notation while the greek indices run through @xmath8 .",
    "the chosen metric signature is @xmath9 , and the geometric units as @xmath10 .",
    "we adopted the metric formalism as given in @xcite .",
    "we assume the general static spherically symmetric metric ansatz of the form @xmath11 the einstein s field equations with the cosmological constant @xmath2 are @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy - momentum tensors for an electromagnetic field and the energy - momentum tensor for the nonminimally coupled global monopole ( gm ) field , respectively . the field eqs .",

    "these constants are actually the global monopole charge and the mass of the black hole respectively . so using ( [ 6 ] ) the metric function @xmath46 in ( [ 4 ] )",

    "the rate of change in the mass of a black hole is called mass accretion rate and is generally represented by @xmath248 . basically , it measures the mass of a black hole per unit time .",
    "it is defined as the area times flux of a black hole at the event horizon . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the effect of radius on the accretion rate .",
    "the general expression to calculate it is @xmath249 @xcite , which refers to relativistic statement of the flux of mass - energy density . in non - relativistic treatment , @xmath250 is defined as the flux of rest - mass density _ or _",

    "( [ 56 ] ) with ( [ 60 ] ) , we get an another useful relation @xmath273 where @xmath274 is a constant such that @xmath275 @xcite . using ( [ 56 ] )",
    ", the black hole s rate of change of mass takes the following form @xmath276 then , it becomes @xmath277 due to the boundary condition at infinity .",
    "this result is valid for any fluid which obeys the equation of state of the form @xmath278 .",
    "so , the accretion rate for the black hole will be @xmath279 at black hole horizon @xmath280 .",

    "it can be seen that for all values of @xmath0 the accretion rate increases but when it reaches to the maximum limit , it will decrease .",
    "also , we see the large monopole parameter @xmath0 greatly suppresses the maximum accretion rate .",
    "in @xmath294 , the first solution of the einstein field equations with a global monopole was derived @xcite . here",
    ", we have derived the line element ( metric ) for the reissner - nordstrm-(anti)-de - sitter spacetime with global monopole . by assuming certain conservation laws for the adiabatic system",
    ", we explored the behaviour of fluid .",
    "generally , the equation of state helps us to identify about what kind of fluid is accreting onto black hole . here",
    ", we have focussed mainly on the ultra - stiff , ultra - relativistic , radiation and sub - relativistic fluids .",
    "different kind of fluids with the unique value of state parameter have different kind of evolution onto the black hole .",
    "we have not considered the cases for the vacuum energy or cosmological constant since their accretion does not change that much evolution of the black hole .",
    "further , we have assumed that only a single test fluid accretes onto black hole at a certain time and discussed the isothermal as well as the polytropic flows . though we have derived the general expressions for all type of fluids satisfying the isothermal and polytropic equation of state but for isothermal equation of state we have also find the solutions of the mentioned fluids at the sonic point .",
    "however , in case of polytropic fluids there exists no global solutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have determined the general analytical expression for the mass accretion rate @xmath250 and found that @xmath250 depends on the mass and charge of the black hole and large monopole parameter @xmath0 suppresses the maximum accretion rate frequently .",
    "a number of extensions to our study is possible .",
    "for instance , one may attempt to consider a non - adiabatic system , so that the fluids may have the effects due to viscosity and energy transfer .",
    "it is also interesting to extend this result to the region between the sonic point and boundary .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the spherically symmetric but non - static geometry of the fluid where the velocity and energy density of the fluid varies with the time and position .",
    "uc was supported by the scientific research projects coordination unit of akdeniz university ( bap ) .",
    "we would like to thank the referees for giving insightful comments to improve this work .",
