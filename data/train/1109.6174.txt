    "the classicalization scenario advocates that the high - energy behavior of certain classes of seemingly simple scalar field theories can be nontirivial .",
    "typically , such theories are described by lagrangians which include non - renormalizable higher - derivative terms .",
    "it is possible that scattering in the context of such theories can take place at distances much larger than the typical length scale @xmath0 associated with the couplings multiplying the non - renormalizable terms .",
    "the scattering scale @xmath1 , which is termed classicalization radius and determines the cross - section , depends on the center of mass energy in a nontrivial way . the conjecture put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite is that distances much smaller than @xmath1 can not be probed , as all significant scattering takes place already at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the loss of unitarity expected when probing length scales @xmath2 , as a result of the presence of the non - renormalizable terms , never occurs .",
    "the classicalization picture relies heavily on the analogy with black - hole formation at ultra - planckian energies .",
    "the high - energy scale @xmath0 is the analogue of the planck scale , while the classicalization radius @xmath1 the analogue of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the classicalon is a configuration of the scalar field that mimicks the behavior of the black hole .",
    "both objects are one - parameter solutions of the equations of motion with a singularity at the origin . in the case of the black hole",
    "the singularity is hidden behind the horizon . for the classicalon",
    ", it is usually attributed to a source term generated by the self - sourcing of the field in situations in which its energy is concentrated in small regions of space . in specific examples ,",
    "the field configuration is split into a part @xmath3 , that corresponds to a solution of the equation of motion in the absence of the non - renormalizable terms , and a perturbation @xmath4 .",
    "perturbation theory generates an equation of motion for @xmath5 , which includes a source term resulting from the variation of the non - renormalizable terms evaluated for @xmath6 .",
    "it seems clear that the perturbative arguments need to be reinforced by a non - perturbative analysis .",
    "as the essence of the classicalization picture is that only classical physics is relevant for the theories in question , the necessary procedure is obvious : one needs to solve the classical equation of motion of the full theory for the scattering problem .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study the form of this equation for the case of a collapsing spherical wavepacket discussed in ref .",
    "even though an accurate numerical solution is a difficult technical task that we postpone for the future , the general properties of the equation can be established more easily . in particular , the emergence of the classicalization radius @xmath1 , the formation of shock fronts and the occurence of scattering already at this scale , as well as the suppression of wave propagation at length scales smaller than @xmath1 , seem plausible predictions of the equation of motion .",
