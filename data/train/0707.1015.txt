    "understanding the effects of competing interactions and the associated quantum phase transitions in models of strongly correlated electron systems is still one of the main issues of modern condensed matter physics . in one dimension correlation effects",
    "are particularly strong and a number of analytical and numerical tools have been developed for this case .",
    "this has led to intense work on such systems in the last decades .",
    "one of the seminal models in this context is the extended hubbard model    @xmath2    here @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath5 at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the amplitude of a nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath10 an on - site and @xmath11 a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion .",
    "a possible additional magnetic field is denoted by @xmath12 and the chemical potential by @xmath13 . here",
    "we will concentrate on the half - filled case @xmath14 . in the following",
    ", we will only keep the hopping amplitude @xmath9 where it is necessary for the sake of clarity and set @xmath15 otherwise .    in the strong coupling limit , @xmath16 ,",
    "it is easy to see by simple energetical considerations that two different ground states exist : for @xmath17 the system is an insulator with long - range charge density wave ( cdw ) order whereas for @xmath18 a state with quasi - long - range spin density wave ( sdw ) order forms .",
    "the transition between these two phases in the strong coupling limit is first order.@xcite in the weak coupling limit , @xmath19 , the model can be studied using bosonization and g - ology .",
    "@xcite in this framework one finds again a phase transition between the sdw and cdw phase at @xmath20 . in the spin sector",
    "this transition is driven by an operator which turns from marginally irrelevant in the sdw phase to marginally relevant in the cdw phase .",
    "the spin gap therefore opens up exponentially slowly and the transition in the spin sector is of kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type . in the charge sector , on the other hand , there is a relevant operator in both phases leading to a charge gap .",
    "the amplitude of this operator vanishes only at the transition line @xmath20 so that the charge gap disappears.@xcite the transition in the charge sector is therefore second order .",
    "already from the strong and weak coupling approaches it is clear that a point @xmath21 in the intermediate coupling regime must exist where the order of the phase transition changes .    in the last few years",
    "the extended hubbard model has attracted renewed attention because it has been suggested that the phase diagram obtained by the weak coupling g - ology approach and strong - coupling perturbation theory might not be complete .",
    "nakamura pointed out first that there is no symmetry requiring the lines in @xmath22,@xmath23-parameter space , where the marginal operator in the spin sector changes sign and where the relevant operator in the charge sector vanishes , to coincide.@xcite the coupling constants for these two operators do coincide in the standard g - ology approach where they are calculated to first order in the interaction parameters .",
    "however , they might differ once higher order corrections are taken into account .",
    "this opens up the possibility for an intermediate phase . by extracting the scaling dimensions related to the critical exponents of certain correlation functions from finite size energy spectra , nakamura indeed found a phase with long - range dimer order in a small region between the sdw and cdw phases",
    "this phase is often called a bond - order wave ( bow ) state .",
    "the existence of such a phase around @xmath20 in the weak coupling regime was supported by quantum - monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite as well as by a g - ology approach where the coupling constants have been calculated beyond leading order.@xcite however , in a first dmrg calculation @xcite such a phase was only found _ above _ the tricritical point @xmath21 and only directly at the first order transition line .",
    "a later dmrg calculation,@xcite on the other hand , qualitatively confirms again the phase diagram as proposed by nakamura .",
    "further evidence for the existence of a bow phase in the weak coupling regime was also provided by a functional renormalization group analysis.@xcite    although the most recent dmrg@xcite and the most recent qmc study@xcite agree that a bow phase of finite extent does exist , they disagree about the shape of this phase .",
    "whereas in the phase diagram of ref .",
    "the bow phase ends at the tricritical point , it extends beyond this point to larger values of @xmath24 in the phase diagram of ref .  .",
    "the question whether the tricritical point also marks the end of the bow phase or is located on the bow - cdw boundary therefore remains an open issue .    in this work",
    "we will investigate the half - filled one - dimensional extended hubbard model using a density - matrix renormalization algorithm applied to transfer matrices ( tmrg ) .",
    "this numerical method allows it to calculate thermodynamic properties of the model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will provide further evidence for the correctness of the phase diagram as first proposed by nakamura and give an estimate for the tricritical point @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we will argue based on our numerical results that the bow phase ends at the tricritical point and does not extend to larger values of @xmath24 in contrast to the findings in ref .  .",
    "in the process , we will develop and discuss criteria to identify the different phases and transition lines by considering usual thermodynamic quantities like the uniform magnetic susceptibility , the isothermal compressibility ( charge susceptibility ) , and the specific heat .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ tmrg ] we briefly introduce the tmrg algorithm and compare results for the hubbard model ( @xmath25 ) with exact results obtained by the bethe ansatz . in sec .",
    "[ pd ] we then present results for a variety of thermodynamic quantities which allow us to determine the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group applied to transfer matrices ( tmrg ) has been explained in detail in [ , , ] . here",
    "we only want to briefly discuss the most important aspects .",
    "the tmrg algorithm is based on a mapping of a one - dimensional quantum system to a two - dimensional classical one by means of a trotter - suzuki decomposition . in the classical model one direction",
    "is spatial whereas the other corresponds to the inverse temperature . for the classical system a so called quantum transfer matrix ( qtm )",
    "is defined which evolves along the spatial direction . at any",
    "non - zero temperature the qtm has the crucial property that its largest eigenvalue @xmath26 is separated from the other eigenvalues by a finite gap .",
    "the partition function of the system in the thermodynamic limit is therefore determined by @xmath26 only , allowing it to perform this limit exactly .",
    "the trotter - suzuki decomposition is discrete so that the transfer matrix has a finite number of sites or local boltzmann weights @xmath27 .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the discretization parameter used in the trotter - suzuki decomposition .",
    "the algorithm starts at some high - temperature value where @xmath27 is so small that the qtm can be diagonalized exactly . using a standard infinite - size dmrg algorithm , sites",
    "are then added to the qtm leading to a successive lowering of the temperature .",
    "a source for a systematic error in these calculations is the finite discretization parameter @xmath29 .",
    "however , this only leads to errors of order @xmath30 in all thermodynamic quantities considered in the following .",
    "we will choose @xmath31 or @xmath32 so that this systematic error will only be of order @xmath33 .",
    "another error is introduced by the truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "this error will grow with decreasing temperature and will finally make the calculations unreliable . down to which temperature",
    "the dmrg algorithm works will depend on the maximum number of states @xmath34 kept in the truncated hilbert space basis .",
    "the truncation error is difficult to estimate .",
    "we therefore start by comparing our tmrg results for the hubbard model ( @xmath25 ) with exact results obtained by bethe ansatz.@xcite within the tmrg algorithm nothing changes fundamentally when we introduce the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath23 so that we expect a similar accuracy in this case .    as an example",
    ", we consider the case @xmath35 . results with a similar accuracy are also obtained for other @xmath22 . using the tmrg method ,",

    "of the hubbard model at @xmath35 with @xmath38 states kept ( red solid line ) compared to bethe ansatz data ( circles ) as a function of temperature @xmath39 .",
    "the lower graph shows the error @xmath40 of the tmrg calculation . ]",
    "it is also easy to calculate the expectation values of local operators with the tmrg algorithm . to obtain the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath41 , the expectation value @xmath42",
    "is calculated in the presence of a small magnetic field @xmath43 .",
    "the susceptibility is then given by @xmath44 and shown in comparison to the exact result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     for the magnetic susceptibility @xmath41 .",
    "]    similarly , the isothermal compressibility ( charge susceptibility ) , @xmath45 , is obtained by applying a small chemical potential @xmath46 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     for the charge susceptibility @xmath45 . ]    for the spin and charge susceptibilities @xmath47 the error does not exceed @xmath48 down to temperatures @xmath49 .",
    "for the specific heat @xmath50 , the errors are an order of magnitude larger because a second numerical derivative has to be calculated .",
    "to investigate the phase diagram we will consider a number of different thermodynamic quantities like magnetic susceptibilities , compressibilities , specific heats , and expectation values of local operators .",
    "furthermore , we will study the behavior of correlation lengths which can be obtained within the tmrg method by calculating next - leading eigenvalues of the qtm .",
    "@xcite depending on the required accuracy and the temperature regime we want to access the basis for the truncated hilbert space will consist of @xmath51 states .",
    "we start with the strong coupling limit where the two existing phases and the first order phase transition between these phases are well understood .",
    "we then derive an estimate for the tricritical point where the first order line ends .",
    "next we discuss the considerably more complicated weak coupling regime and present the phase diagram as obtained by tmrg .",
    "finally , we will address the controversial question whether or not the bow phase ends at the tricritical point . throughout , we will discuss in how far one can identify the different phases and phase transitions by studying only easily measurable thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and compressibility .      in the strong coupling limit , @xmath16 , the ground state energy can be systematically expanded in terms of the hopping parameter @xmath9 . in lowest order , the hopping can be completely neglected .",
    "then , depending on the ratio @xmath52 , two different ground states are possible .",
    "these states are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    .",
    "the state in the first line is a cdw state where every second site is doubly occupied , whereas the state in the second line is a state with every site singly occupied .",
    "virtual hopping processes induce a quasi long - range sdw order for this state . ]",
    "the energy of the cdw state is then given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the number of lattice sites .",
    "the sdw state has energy @xmath55 .",
    "the two energies as a function of @xmath24 cross at @xmath20 resulting in a first order phase transition . as usual , in second order in @xmath9 , virtual hopping processes lead to an effective antiferromagnetic coupling of heisenberg type for the spins in the sdw state with coupling constant @xmath56.@xcite this state therefore has a charge gap but no spin gap and algebraically decaying spin correlation functions . the cdw state , on the other hand , has a charge and a spin gap .",
    "excitations for the cdw and sdw state , ignoring hopping processes , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_exc ] .        in lowest order perturbation theory , the energies of the excited states depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_exc ] are given by @xmath57 for the excited cdw states , and @xmath58 for the excited sdw states .",
    "excitation ( 1 ) in the cdw state is a charge excitation , whereas the breaking of a double occupancy - excitation ( 2 ) - is a spin excitation .",
    "if we separate the two single spins in this excited state we obtain an excitation energy @xmath59 , i.e. , each single spin contributes @xmath60 . in thermodynamic data",
    "the activated behavior will be characterized by the energy of a single excitation irrespective of whether these excitations appear in pairs or not . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", it follows that at the transition line charge and spin gap as obtained from thermodynamic data are expected to be equal @xmath61 and that both gaps increase linearly @xmath62 away from the transition line . in the sdw phase , excitation ( 1 )",
    "is also a charge excitation and has a lower energy than excitation ( 2 ) .",
    "the charge gap in the sdw phase is therefore given by @xmath63 and is independent of @xmath23 .    in fig .",

    "another quantity which allows us to detect the phase transition and to determine its order is the double occupancy @xmath77 in the strong coupling limit at zero temperature @xmath78 in the sdw state and @xmath79 in the cdw state . in fig .",

    "however , a jump in @xmath80 at @xmath81 is obvious . in the cdw phase @xmath80 continues to increase with @xmath23 and approaches @xmath82 in the large @xmath23 limit .",
    "the specific heat shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] has two maxima for @xmath65 and @xmath25 .",
    "the lower and higher temperature maximum are due to spin and ( gapped ) charge excitations , respectively.@xcite at low temperatures only the gapless spin excitations do therefore contribute and conformal field theory predicts @xmath83 with increasing @xmath23 the spin velocity @xmath84 increases leading to a decreasing slope and to a shift of the lower temperature maximum to higher temperatures . at the same time the charge gap decreases leading to a shift of the higher temperature maximum to lower temperatures .",
    "the behavior changes drastically above the phase transition @xmath85 , because in the cdw phase the spin excitations are now also gapped and the specific heat shows activated behavior @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the emergence of a sharp peak for @xmath88 can be understood as follows : because @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the ground state energy , the area under the curve will be nearly unchanged when going from a value just below the phase transition , say @xmath91 , to a value just above the transition , say @xmath92 .",

    "for @xmath95 we can still detect a finite jump @xmath96 at @xmath97 ( see fig .",

    "the phase diagram in the weak coupling limit is more complicated than in the strong coupling limit . instead of a first order , we expect different continuous phase transitions here .",
    "theoretically , the weak - coupling limit can be investigated by bosonization with the coupling constants of the operators in the effective hamiltonian being determined in first order in the interaction parameters .",
    "this method is also often termed g - ology.@xcite as usual in one - dimension , the charge and the spin sector completely separate in the low - energy effective bosonic theory due to the linearization of the excitation spectrum . in the charge sector at half - filling , umklapp scattering leads to a relevant interaction term in the bosonic hamiltonian which creates a charge gap . in the spin sector , on the other hand ,",
    "the leading interaction term corresponding to backward scattering is only marginal .",
    "the amplitudes of both terms in the weak - coupling limit are proportional to @xmath107.@xcite the system therefore has always a charge gap except at @xmath20 where the amplitude of the umklapp scattering term vanishes .",
    "the charge gap at fixed @xmath22 near the phase transition behaves as @xmath108 with @xmath109 being an interaction dependent critical exponent and @xmath110 at weak coupling .",
    "this means that the transition in the charge sector is second order . in the spin sector at weak coupling the backward scattering term is marginally irrelevant if @xmath18 so that the spin excitations are gapless . for @xmath17",
    "this term becomes marginally relevant and a spin gap @xmath64 appears .",
    "however , this gap only opens up exponentially slow , i.e. , for a fixed @xmath22 and @xmath88 we expect @xmath111 with @xmath110 at weak coupling.@xcite the phase transition in the spin sector is therefore of kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type .",
    "as nakamura [ ] first noted , there is no symmetry which fixes the amplitude of the umklapp and backward scattering terms to be the same .",
    "so although these amplitudes are identical to first order in the interaction parameters , one would expect in general that they start to differ once higher order corrections are taken into account . in this case",
    "an additional phase between the sdw and cdw phases would occur . as already outlined in the introduction different methods",
    "have given strong evidence that an additional phase with bow order does indeed exist although some controversy about the extent of this additional phase remains.@xcite    in the following , we will first develop a criterion which allows us to determine the second order line where the charge gap closes with high precision from thermodynamic data .",
    "next , we will consider the kt - type transition where the spin gap opens .",

    "if the correlation function decays algebraically , this correlation length will diverge like @xmath171 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the correlation function decays exponentially even at zero temperature then @xmath170 stays finite .",
    "finally , for a correlation function showing true long - range order at zero temperature the correlation length will diverge like @xmath172 where @xmath67 is the gap for the corresponding excitations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_corr ] we show , as an example , the leading sdw , cdw and bow correlation lengths for @xmath98 and @xmath173 .",
    "[ fig_corr ]   +   +    here the leading sdw and cdw correlation lengths stay finite whereas the bow correlation length diverges faster than @xmath118 indicating long - range bow order at zero temperature .",

    "true long - range order the corresponding @xmath175 will diverge exponentially with temperature , whereas @xmath175 will go to a constant ( zero if the operator is conserved ) for short - range order .",
    "the situation is , however , complicated if the correlation function shows quasi long - range order , i.e. , decays algebraically . here",
    "we want to consider the case that only one sort of excitations is gapless , say the spin excitations . from conformal field theory",

    "[ fig14 ] must have long - range bow order .",
    "for @xmath196 , on the other hand , we would expect @xmath203 if bow order does exist as found in ref .   so that an exponential divergence should already become obvious at @xmath204 . however , down to @xmath205 we see no indication of such a behavior , instead the bow correlation length seems to diverge exactly as @xmath118 indicating that we are in the sdw phase .",

    "we studied the thermodynamics of the half - filled one - dimensional extended hubbard model using a tmrg algorithm .",
    "the focus was put on identifying the various phase transitions by considering thermodynamic quantities which are usually easy to measure like the uniform magnetic susceptibility , @xmath41 , or the isothermal compressibility , @xmath45 . for strong coupling",
    "we calculated the charge gap in the sdw as well as charge and spin gap in the cdw phase in lowest order perturbation theory .",
    "the theoretical results were confirmed by tmrg calculations of @xmath41 and @xmath45 . in the weak coupling regime where the phase transitions are",
    "continuous we showed that @xmath45-curves for a fixed @xmath22 and different @xmath23 as a function of temperature cross in one well defined point if measured in the sdw or bow phase . in the cdw phase ,",
    "on the other hand , no crossing occurs .",
    "we used this criterion to determine the boundary of the cdw phase with high accuracy .",
    "the kt transition line , on the other hand , where the spin gap starts to open exponentially slowly is very difficult to determine from thermodynamic data .",
    "universal scaling relations obtained from conformal field theory for the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat in the sdw phase turned out to be useless for this purpose .",
    "these scaling relations are only valid at temperatures @xmath112 which are not accessible by tmrg because the charge gap @xmath75 is already very small near the kt transition .",
    "we could , however , show that extracting the spin gap from the magnetic susceptibility where it is large enough and fitting it to a field theory formula does allow to determine the transition line reasonably well .",
    "in particular , the results clearly confirm that the two transition lines do not coincide and that an intermediate phase exists . by studying correlation lengths and static susceptibilities",
    "we confirmed that this additional phase has long - range bond order .",
    "we were also able to determine the tricritical point accurately and found @xmath0 , @xmath208 .",
    "furthermore , we showed that above this point long - range bond order does not exist .",
    "instead we find that bow correlations can be dominant in this regime while still decaying algebraically at zero temperature .",
