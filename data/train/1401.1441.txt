    "hadron physics in the charm and beauty sectors is booming , with mounting activity in experiments babar , cleo , belle , bes , lhc@xmath12 , cdf @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "one of the issues that has attracted much attention is the finding of hadronic states which can not be interpreted in the conventional picture of @xmath13 for mesons and @xmath14 for baryons .",
    "multiquark states , hybrids or hadronic molecules have been suggested in several works @xcite .",
    "the molecular picture stands on firm grounds once the use of chiral unitary theory in the light quark sector , or its extension through the local hidden gauge approach , has shown that many mesonic and baryonic resonances are dynamically generated from the interaction of more elementary hadron components @xcite .",
    "concerning baryonic resonances with charm or hidden charm , work on molecules has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , while in the beauty sector , baryon states with beauty or hidden beauty have also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "@xmath7 excited states have been reported by the lhc@xmath12 collaboration in ref . @xcite .",
    "two states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are found in the experiment , with widths smaller than 0.66 mev in both cases .",
    "although no direct spin and parity have been determined , the states are interpreted as orbitally excited states of the ground state of the @xmath15 .",
    "one of the states , the @xmath5 , has been confirmed by the cdf collaboration in refs .",
    "the association to the orbitally excited states of the @xmath15 seems most natural since predictions of quark models had been done for these states , as the orbitally excited @xmath7 states with @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "compared to the observed results , the @xmath7 masses , including that of the ground state , are only off by about 30 - 35 mev .",
    "the closest work in spirit to the present one is that of ref .",
    "@xcite where these states are dynamically generated from the interaction of mesons and baryons . in ref .",
    "@xcite the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) is used as an underlying symmetry . according to it , the @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 states are degenerate in the heavy quark limit , as well as the @xmath20 baryon states , which are then considered together in a coupled channels approach .",
    "an extrapolation of the weinberg tomozawa interaction in the light sector is then used @xcite , with elements of an su(6 ) spin - isospin symmetry @xcite . with suitable choices of the renormalization scheme for the loops , good agreement with the masses of the newly found @xmath7 states",
    "is obtained .",
    "our scheme takes advantage of the study done in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those works",
    "it was found that the use of the extended local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector fully respects the hqss , but it provided a dynamics different from the one of ref .",
    "in particular , the connection between @xmath18 and @xmath19 states ( or baryon states with @xmath20 ) requires pion exchange , or anomalous terms , which are found subleading in the large heavy quark mass counting , and numerically small .",
    "similar conclusions are also found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in some works @xcite ,",
    "pion exchange is found relevant compared to vector meson exchange ( the dominant terms in the local hidden gauge approach ) , but as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is in part due to the use of a type of form factor for vector mesons , not present when the equivalent chiral amplitudes are constructed , that suppresses the vector exchange .    with the dynamics of the extended local hidden gauge approach ,",
    "the number of coupled channels is small for each quantum number and we can get a good feeling of the basic building blocks in the dynamically generated states that appear . as we shall see , the two @xmath7 excited states are generated with masses close to the experimental ones , but more remarkable , the difference in the masses of the two excited states agrees well with experiment",
    ". the widths obtained are zero within our basis of coupled channels , quite in agreement with the widths smaller than 0.66 mev found in the experiment .",
    "we also make predictions in other isospin and spin sectors . on the formal aspects we show how the dominant terms correspond to having a heavy quark as spectator and present an easy way to implement the results of the heavy quark spin - flavour symmetry from the impulse approximation at the quark level .",
    "we will look at the states @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 which can couple to @xmath26 which we will investigate .",
    "similarly , we shall look at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , belonging to a decuplet of @xmath34 states . in the local hidden gauge approach in su(3 ) @xcite the meson baryon interaction proceeds via the exchange of vector mesons as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when we exchange a light vector meson in diagram ( a ) , ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , the heavy quarks of the meson or the baryon are spectators and hence the interaction does not depend on their spin nor its flavour . from the technical point of view the interaction of the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] can be obtained using su(3 ) symmetry considering @xmath35 quarks , since we do not consider states with strangeness or hidden strangeness .",
    "thus , all matrix elements of the interaction are formally identical ( except for the mass or energy dependence ) to those found for the interaction of the analogous states @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this interaction has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the transition potential from channel @xmath46 to channel @xmath47 is given by @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 the pion decay constant , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) the mass , energy of baryon of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) channel .",
    "we take @xmath52 since we exchange light vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath53 coefficients are evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite and we quote them below .    for pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath54 baryons we have the coupled channels @xmath25 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 in @xmath8 and the @xmath53 coefficients are given in table [ tab : vij0 ] .",
    ".@xmath53 coefficients for @xmath8 and @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , we predict 6 states with @xmath8 , two of them corresponding to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and 8 states with @xmath9 .",
    "the energies of the states range from about 5800 mev to 6500 mev .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results obtained here with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this later work ,",
    "the same interaction as here is used for the main diagonal channels , but the transition between different coupled channels is not obtained through vector or pion exchange as done here , but invoking a combined su(6 ) and heavy quark spin symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite the states of @xmath9 are not investigated but for @xmath8 four states are obtained , two of them , with @xmath6 , are also associated to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in spite of the differences in the input ,",
    "there are common features in the results .",
    "the two states associated to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 exhibit , as here , a substantial coupling to @xmath2 .",
    "there is also a @xmath56 state in ref .",
    "@xcite at 5797 mev which we find at 5820 mev , only 33 mev higher , and another state at 6009 mev that we find at 5969 mev , 40 mev below .",
    "the mostly @xmath57 state found here at 6316 mev , basically degenerate in @xmath6 , was either not found or not searched for in ref .",
    "@xcite because of its higher mass .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the results of the two approaches is remarkable and gives further support to the common predictions . in addition",
    ", we have investigated states of @xmath9 and we find quite a few , some of them narrow enough for a clear experimental observation .",
    "in this work we studied the interaction of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states with its coupled channels using dynamics mapped from the light quark sector to the heavy one . the starting point was to assume that the heavy quarks act as spectators in the dominant terms of the interaction .",
    "then we studied pion exchange and vector exchange and obtained the results of pion exchange in the heavy quark spin symmetric approach combined with results of lattice qcd .",
    "the same procedure led us to the standard interaction of the extended local hidden gauge approach from the exchange of light vector mesons . with these elements of the interaction , supplemented with the subleading terms , in the large heavy quark mass",
    "counting , obtained from the exchange of heavy mesons in the local hidden gauge approach , we studied the interaction of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with their coupled channels @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 ( for the @xmath0 ) ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( for the @xmath1 ) ; @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( for the @xmath2 ) ; and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( for the @xmath3 ) , and we searched for poles of the scattering matrix in different states of spin and isospin .",
    "we found six states in @xmath8 , with one of them degenerate in spin @xmath6 , and eight states in @xmath9 , less bound , two of them degenerate in spin @xmath6 , and two more degenerate in spin @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling of the states to the different channels were evaluated , together with their wave function at the origin , in order to get a feeling of which are the largest building blocks in those molecular states .",
    "in particular , when studying the interaction of @xmath2 with its coupled channels , we found two states in @xmath8 , degenerate in spin @xmath6 , which couple mostly to @xmath2 .",
    "the degeneracy is broken when the pion exchange is considered , allowing a mixture with intermediate @xmath0 states .",
    "then we find that the mass of the states is close to 5910 mev for natural values of the regularizing cutoff .",
    "more important , the splitting between the two states when the pion exchange is considered is found of the order of 10 mev , rather independent of the cutoff used .",
    "this feature was considered relevant in view of the existence of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , which are separated by this amount of energy . a fine tuning of the cut off",
    "was then done to match the exact energy of one of these states and then it was used subsequently to make predictions in all the other sectors of spin , isopin , leading to the states reported above .",
    "we think that the use of realistic dynamics , with strict fulfilment of heavy quark spin - flavour symmetry , make the results obtained here rather accurate and should serve as a guideline for future experimental searches of baryon states with open beauty .",
