    "evolution of the globular cluster systems ( gcs ) in our galaxy and external galaxies has received a burst of recent interest .",
    "new hst observations of the gcs in the virgo ellipticals allow a direct comparison of the globular cluster luminosity functions ( gclf ) in different galaxies .",
    "the assumption that the peak of the gclf occurs at a constant luminosity for galaxies of a given type , and varies slowly and in a predictable manner with the galactic type , has been used widely as a distance indicator ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) although the theoretical basis for this expectation remains unclear .    on the theoretical front ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( 1996a , b , c ) extending earlier work of @xcite and @xcite have shown that significant evolution of the gcs is to be expected over the hubble time .",
    "the inner populations of globular clusters are most affected by the tidal shocks and dynamical friction .",
    "the first of these effects discriminates preferentially against the less dense and less massive clusters , the latter affecting the most massive clusters , to shape the currently observed distribution of luminosities .",
    "we have shown ( gnedin 1997 ) that the expected statistical `` brightening '' of the inner clusters ( due , really , to the destruction of some of the less luminous clusters ) is indeed observed in the three best studied galaxies , the milky way , m31 , and m87 ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we examine the hypothesis that a common initial distribution of clusters existed in the inner and outer parts of all the studied galaxies with the apparent variations due to the influence of dynamical evolution .",
    "and then we show how the method can be used to obtain an independent estimate of the distance for galaxies with an observed distribution of globular cluster apparent magnitudes .",
    "the primary processes driving globular cluster evolution are two - body relaxation , evaporation of stars through the tidal limit , tidal shocks , and dynamical friction .",
    "relaxation is the only internal effect and in zeroth approximation does not depend on the position of the cluster in the galaxy .",
    "the tidal effects do depend on the density of the galactic environment and tend to destroy less dense clusters .",
    "the rate of inspiral due to dynamical friction is proportional to the cluster mass , @xmath5 , thus preferentially destroying the most massive clusters .",
    "both the tidal effects and dynamical friction are strongly enhanced in the inner part of the galaxy and are weak on the outskirts .",
    "therefore it is possible that the outer populations of globular clusters may still bear the form of the initial distribution , whereas the inner population is affected by the extrinsic dynamical effects .",
    "passive evolution , through stellar interior processes and two - body relaxation , is expected for all clusters .",
    "a more careful treatment would allow for the interaction between internal and external effects .",
    "first we shall make an attempt to reconstruct the original distribution using the outer cluster sample .",
    "the simplest generalization of the gclf is a two - dimensional distribution of the cluster mass and density .",
    "a useful estimate of the cluster density is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the half - mass radius .",
    "since only the galactic clusters are well resolved , we use the sample of the milky way clusters tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the core - collapsed clusters were eliminated from the sample due to the observational difficulty of estimating their radii .",
    "we also rejected the few very distant clusters ( beyond 60 kpc from the galactic center ) as being of uncertain origin .",
    "the remaining sample consists of 94 clusters .",
    "we set the boundary between the two samples at the galactocentric radius @xmath8 kpc , thus putting 36 clusters in the inner and 58 clusters in the outer groups .",
    "the outer sample has more members because we expect the inner population to be significantly depleted .",
    "this choice also maximizes the difference between the two populations within the range @xmath9 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : massden ] shows the distribution of the defined sample of galactic globular clusters in the @xmath10 plane . throughout , we use an assumed mass - to - visual - light ratio of @xmath11 to estimate masses when velocity dispersions are not available",
    ". the area occupied by the inner clusters is visibly constrained by the survival boundaries of dynamical friction and the tidal shocks .",
    "the boundaries for the inner clusters ( the horizontal and vertical dotted lines ) are defined as the median clusters that would marginally survive in the age of the galaxy conservatively estimated as @xmath12 gyr . for details",
    "see @xcite .    as noted by @xcite and @xcite , dynamical friction",
    "does not pose a serious cutoff on the distribution of the clusters in milky way .",
    "it will , however , be seen to be important for the m87 globulars because their distribution function is much better sampled ( see  [ sec : m87 ] ) .",
    "the tidal shocks are , on the contrary , very important in destroying the low density clusters .",
    "notice a very strong correlation between the mass and density of the outer clusters .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.76 and the spearman coefficient is 0.77 , so the probability of no correlation is less than @xmath13 .",
    "the two - dimensional least - squares fit gives a useful relation between the half - mass radius and mass of globular clusters that has not been investigated before : @xmath14 or approximately @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noting that this relation predicts a very steep dependence on mass of the tidal shock destruction time , @xmath16 , and a shallow dependence on mass of the relaxation time , @xmath17 . as to whether or not this correlation is primordial remains to be seen , since the present sample could have been affected by relaxation itself .",
    "including the correlation in the bivariate distribution reduces the occupied space on the @xmath18 plane and maximizes the distribution function @xmath19 .",
    "while the log  luminosity distribution is known to be approximately gaussian , the distribution of @xmath20 is certainly skewed .",
    "nevertheless , we assume the bivariate gaussian shape for the combined distribution for the sake of tractability .",
    "thus the adopted _ primordial _ distribution function of globular cluster properties is taken to be @xmath21 } \\ ,     dx dy , \\label{eq : df}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the slope of the correlation , and the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fixed by the center of the two - dimensional distribution .",
    "the dispersion along the line of the correlation , @xmath25 , is much larger than that in the perpendicular direction , @xmath26 .",
    "the units adopted are such that the cluster mass is in solar masses and the density is in @xmath27 pc@xmath28 .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : massden ] show the adopted distribution function .",
    "it provides a satisfactory fit to the outer clusters ( denoted by stars ) .",
    "given the initial distribution , we can evolve it in time and compare with the present data for the inner population .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to assume a hard cutoff at the density @xmath29 and mass @xmath30 such that the clusters less dense or more massive than that would have been destroyed within the hubble time by the tidal shocks or dynamical friction , respectively .",
    "such survival boundaries are shown on figure [ fig : massden ] . then , since for most observed gcss we do not know individual values of @xmath7 and hence @xmath31 , we integrate the evolved distribution function over @xmath31 ( hence @xmath32 ) to obtain the evolved mass distribution which can be used to compute the luminosity distributions when studying the gcss in external galaxies .",
    "the result of the integration is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a step function , and ( )  is the complementary error function . equation ( [ eq : df2 ] )",
    "should also be renormalized to the size of the remaining sample . an important consequence of the modified distribution is the shift of the peak , given by the nonlinear equation @xmath37 where we neglected the dynamical friction correction as it is usually not important for the bulk of the sample .",
    "this equation can be easily solved iteratively to obtain @xmath38 . when all parameters of the initial distribution ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : df ] ] ) are fixed , the predicted shift is a function only of @xmath39 , the amplitude of the tidal shocks .",
    "it was calculated approximately , equating the inverse destruction rate of each cluster due to the shocks , @xmath40 ( see gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , to the hubble time . a correction factor of order unity",
    "can be used to calibrate @xmath39 against the data .",
    "taking @xmath41 as true destruction time gives the observed shift between the inner and outer clusters in milky way ( @xmath42 ) , and we adopt this factor here .",
    "the correction in magnitudes is related to the shift @xmath38 by @xmath43 .",
    "the dispersion of the inner sample can also be calculated similarly .",
    "the observed and predicted mass distributions of the galactic globular clusters are shown on figure [ fig : mw2 ] .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "our correction reproduces well both the mean and the dispersion of the inner sample .",
    "the first of these two checks is of course not significant ( but only a check of consistency ) since we fixed the factor 0.3 by the requirement that the observed and computed inner peaks agree at @xmath44 .",
    "but the correct predicted reduction of the dispersion @xmath45 mag seen between the two samples ( @xmath46 ) provides a fair test of the hypothesis that the inner population had the same initial properties as the outer population but was modified by dynamical effects .",
    "table [ tab : deltas ] provides a comparison of the predicted and observed changes in the mean and the dispersion , as well as the associated uncertainty .",
    "the predicted evolution of the mass ( and luminosity ) function of globular clusters can now be immediately applied to the samples in m31 and m87 to test if the predicted values of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 match observations for these independent samples .",
    "we use the same data as gnedin ( 1997 ) who gives the appropriate references .",
    "the amplitude of the tidal shocks scales with the density of the galaxy at a given position , which is @xmath49 for a spherically symmetric system . here",
    "@xmath50 is the rotation speed ( or the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies ) at the median radius @xmath51 of the globular clusters from the center of the galaxy . while the velocity can be directly measured , only angular distances are available for external galaxies so the physical distance will scale with the assumed distance to the galaxy , @xmath52 .",
    "the dynamical friction cutoff also depends on both @xmath50 and @xmath51 through @xmath53 , where we neglect the slowly varying logarithmic factor . even though both @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the distance @xmath54 to the galaxy , the correction ( eq . [ [ eq : dy ] ] )",
    "can be applied in a self - consistent manner without any initial assumptions about the distance .",
    "the method proposed below is fully independent and will _ predict _ , rather than use , the distance @xmath54 .",
    "if the observed samples is rich enough it could be divided into inner and outer halves , or even further ; the method can be applied to each of the subpopulations separately and the distance estimated as average over the individual results . in principle , the narrower the division of the sample into radial bins the better the accuracy of the median estimator @xmath51 ; in reality , the subsamples should have a large enough number of members to represent well the luminosity function . for m31 and m87",
    "we take the inner and outer halves of the sample , as defined by gnedin ( 1997 ) . for m31",
    ", the inner clusters have the median radius at @xmath55 , whereas the outer clusters have @xmath56 .",
    "the rotation velocity of m31 is estimated to be @xmath57 km s@xmath3 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 km s@xmath3 for @xmath60 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us demostrate how the method works on the example on the inner population of globular clusters in the andromeda .",
    "the mean magnitude of the subsample @xmath61 ( gnedin 1997 ) so the trial value of the distance modulus is taken to be @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the center of the assumed initial distribution of globular clusters . using this distance we calculate the critical shock density @xmath64 and the corresponding correction to the peak magnitude , @xmath65 .",
    "the peak of the inner gclf therefore becomes dimmer and the second estimate of the distance modulus is @xmath66 .",
    "now second and further iterations are performed to calculate new @xmath29 and to obtain new estimate of @xmath67 until convergence is achieved .",
    "usually 4 or 5 iterations are sufficient to obtain the distance modulus to an accuracy better than 0.01 mag . in case of the inner clusters of m31 ,",
    "the final predicted shift of the peak magnitude is @xmath68 and the distance is @xmath69 .",
    "the same operations are then repeated for the outer clusters as well , starting with their mean @xmath70 .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : deltas ] .",
    "now combining the two predicted changes for the inner and outer populations we get an estimate of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for that galaxy .",
    "the predicted change agrees with the observed values within the errors ( table [ tab : deltas ] ) .",
    "the distance modulus of m31 has been obtained by a number of other methods .",
    "the cepheid variables give @xmath71 ( @xcite ) , rr lyrae give @xmath72 ( @xcite ) , fitting color - magnitude diagrams of population ii giants gives @xmath73 ( @xcite ) , and novae give @xmath74 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average of all these methods indicate @xmath75 .",
    "our method predicts @xmath76 ( averaged over the inner and outer samples ; see table [ tab : distances ] ) , in good agreement with the other methods .",
    "note that our result was derived independently from any other distance determinations to the galaxy .    in case of the virgo giant m87",
    "the dispersion of radial velocities @xmath50 is used instead of the rotation velocity as an estimate of the galaxy mass . @xcite",
    "give the mass of m87 of @xmath77 at @xmath78 kpc , so that @xmath79 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the globular clusters are distributed over a larger area ; the median radius of the inner population is at @xmath80 , and of the outer population is at @xmath81 . repeating the same steps as for the m31 sample , we obtain a very good agreement of the predicted changes with the observed @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see table [ tab : deltas ] ) .",
    "the distance modulus to m87 is essentially the same as inferred from the inner or outer samples and is @xmath84 , in remarkably good agreement with the value of @xmath85 as obtained for the center of the virgo cluster based on cepheids , planetary nebulae luminosity function , and surface brightness fluctuations ( quoted by @xcite ) .",
    "the largest source of error in the method proposed here is due to the uncertainty in the peak of the galactic globular clusters , @xmath86 mag .    because of the extreme richness of the clusters in m87",
    ", the effects of dynamical friction should be detectable .",
    "indeed , if we keep the same division of the clusters into the inner and outer populations but consider only the brightest tails of both , with @xmath87 , the outer clusters become relatively brighter ( as the brightest inner clusters are depleted ) . this effect is illustrated in table [ tab : m87 ] .",
    "statistically significant , it shows lack of very bright , and presumably massive , clusters in the inner region , as is expected , if they spiraled into the center by dynamical friction .",
    "the medians provide an even stronger case at the @xmath88 level .",
    "clusters at @xmath89 kpc would reach the center of m87 in the hubble time due to dynamical friction if they are more massive than @xmath90 ( @xcite , p. 428 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the visual magnitude of @xmath91 . in accord , only 4 clusters brighter than @xmath92 are present in the inner sample while the outer sample has 9 as bright members . as suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the dynamical friction rate is strongly enhanced in triaxial halos with box orbits ; this effect can lower even further the mass cutoff .",
    "therefore dynamical friction is important in determining distribution of very bright clusters in m87 .",
    "by applying the corrections for dynamical evolution , the gclf can be used as an improved distance indicator . for example , the method can be used for determining distances to the virgo cluster and , possibly , to the coma cluster .",
    "hst offers the unprecedented opportunity to detect faint globular cluster systems around galaxies in the virgo cluster . having a large sample of such galaxies is essential to eliminate another source of error , the difference in metallicity of different galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have hitherto assumed a fixed mass - to - light ratio whereas it is known that both the luminosity of individual stars of fixed mass and the distribution of masses within clusters are a function of the cluster mean metallicity . an _ ab initio _",
    "correction for such effects would be difficult and uncertain .",
    "but an empirical approach which utilizes the fact that for an evolved population , the mean color is a good proxy for metallicity , should be possible .",
    "the minimization of the effects due to metallicity differences could be done as follows .",
    "assume that the ( @xmath93 ) color of the integrated galaxy light is a fair indicator of the metallicity .",
    "then the mean , @xmath94 , of the gclf of each galaxy @xmath95 is assigned a metallicity correction of the form @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 is a constant to be determined , in addition to the correction @xmath98 for dynamical evolution ; here @xmath99 is the mean color of the galactic sample .",
    "the true mean point is thus @xmath100 we now consider a sample of galaxies all approximately at the same distance ( for example , in the virgo cluster ) but with different mean colors and metallicities .",
    "then @xmath101 we then minimize the dispersion of the individual means @xmath102 around the average @xmath103 , to determine @xmath97 : @xmath104 using this value of @xmath97 , we obtain a statistical estimator ( eq . [ [ eq : mav ] ] ) of the peak of the gclf to be calibrated against the known absolute magnitude , @xmath105 , of the gclf in the milky way and m31 .",
    "the proposed corrected estimator has the advantage of being justified by simple , relatively well understood physics .",
    "when used in a real survey of globular clusters in external galaxies , it may significantly reduce the scatter among the results for different galaxies .",
    "the differences in the inner and outer populations of globular clusters in our own galaxy ( gnedin 1997 ) can be explained in terms of simple dynamical processes such as the tidal shocks and dynamical friction .",
    "assuming that the primordial distribution of globular clusters is common for all galaxies , we derive the correction to the turnover point of the gclf in any galaxy based on the dynamical calculations for the galactic clusters by @xcite .",
    "the predicted shifts between the mean points of the inner and outer cluster populations agree qualitatively with the observed differences within the errors .",
    "the shifts in the dispersion of luminosity between the inner and outer samples of the galaxy , m31 , and m87 are predicted accurately .",
    "a slight mismatch of the mean points for the milky way and m31 of the order 0.2 mag still remains , but is within the statistical errors of the methods applied .",
    "the corrections for dynamical evolution thus allow one to use globular cluster systems in external galaxies as an independent distance indicator .",
    "for a large sample of galaxies at the same distance , as in the virgo and coma clusters , the metallicity corrections could also be used with the aim of reducing still further the scatter in the derived distances .",
    "an extensive survey of the gcs in distant galaxies , performed with the hst , may help produce a reliable distance ladder on the scale of a hundred mpc .",
