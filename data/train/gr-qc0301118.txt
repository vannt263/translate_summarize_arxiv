    "recently @xcite it was assumed that some kind of gravitational flux tube solutions in the 5d kaluza - klein gravity can be considered as string - like objects , namely @xmath0strings .",
    "the idea is that the gravitational flux tubes can be very thin ( approximately @xmath1 ) and arbitrary long .",
    "evidently that such object looks like to a string attached to two universes or to remote parts of a single universe .",
    "the thickness of this object is so small that near to the point of attachment to an external universe the handles of a spacetime foam will appear between this object and the universe .",
    "this is like a delta of the river flowing into the sea .",
    "we call such objects as a @xmath0string .",
    "the @xmath0string has interesting properties : it can transfer electromagnetic waves and consequently the energy ; the mouth is similar to a spread charge ; it is a realization of einstein - wheeler s idea about `` mass without mass '' and `` charge without charge '' ; it has wormhole and string properties ; in some sense it is some realization of einstein s idea that all should be constructed from vacuum ( in this case the @xmath0string is the vacuum solution of 5d gravitational equations ) .    at first these gravitational flux tubes solutions",
    "were obtained as 4d levi - civita - robertson - bertotti solutions @xcite in 4d einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "it is an infinite flux tube filled with parallel electric @xmath2 and and magnetic @xmath3 fields @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is an arbitrary constant angle ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants defined by eq .",
    "( [ intr-30 ] ) ; @xmath7 determines the cross section of the tube and @xmath8 the magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields ; @xmath9 is newton s constant ( @xmath10 , the speed of light ) ; @xmath11 is the electromagnetic field tensor . for @xmath12 ( @xmath13 )",
    "one has a purely electric ( or magnetic ) field .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was obtained similar 5d solutions .",
    "the properties of these solutions depend on the relation @xmath14 between electric @xmath15 and magnetic @xmath16 fields .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate more careful the properties of the gravitational flux tubes with @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we will investigate the solutions of 5d einstein equations @xmath18 here @xmath19 are 5-bein indices ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are 5d ricci tensor and the scalar curvature respectively ; @xmath22 .",
    "the investigated metric is @xmath23 the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the even functions ; @xmath26 is the magnetic charge .",
    "the corresponding equations are @xmath27 the solution of maxwell equation is @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the electric charge .",
    "it is interesting that equations - have not any contribution from the electric field .",
    "nevertheless the electric field has an influence on the solution due the equation for initial values at the point @xmath30 @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "the first analysis was done in ref .",
    "@xcite : the conclusion is that the solution depends on the magnitude of the magnetic charge @xmath26 .",
    "it is found that the solutions to the metric in eq .",
    "( [ sec2 - 20 ] ) evolve in the following way :    1 .",
    "the solution is _ a finite flux tube _ located between two surfaces at @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the throat between the @xmath34 surfaces is filled with electric flux .",
    "2 .   @xmath36 .",
    "the solution is again _ a finite flux tube_. the throat between the surfaces at @xmath34 is filled with both electric and magnetic fields .",
    "3 .   @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the solution is _ an infinite flux tube _ filled with constant electrical and magnetic fields .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution is constant ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "4 .   @xmath39 . in this case",
    "we have _ a singular finite flux tube _ located between two ( + ) and ( - ) electrical and magnetic charges located at @xmath40 . at @xmath41",
    "this solution has real singularities which we interpret as the locations of the charges .",
    "this solution is again _ a singular finite flux tube _ only with magnetic field filling the flux tube . in this solution",
    "the two opposite magnetic charges are confined to a spacetime of fixed volume .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of equations - are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "these numerical calculations allow us to suppose that there is the following relation between functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath43 in the next sections we will demonstrate the correctness of this relation by some approximate analytical calculations .    [ fig3 ]",
    "in this section we will consider the metric in the form @xmath45 and @xmath26 is small parameter @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the solutions of einstein equations with @xmath44 .",
    "the variation of equations - with respect to small perturbations @xmath50 and @xmath51 give us the following equations set @xmath52 the solution of this system is @xmath53 .",

    "shows that it is valid .",
    "one of the most important question here is : how long is the @xmath0string ?",
    "let us determine the length of the @xmath0string as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the place where @xmath66 ( at these points @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is very complicated problem because we have not the analytical solution and the numerical calculations indicate that @xmath65 depends very weakly from @xmath69 parameter : the big magnitude of this parameter leads to the relative small magnitude of @xmath65 .",
    "the expansion allows us to assume that @xmath70 here @xmath71 ; @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath73 then @xmath74 using the maple package we have obtained @xmath75 with accuracy of @xmath76 @xmath77 it is easy to see that this series coincides with @xmath78 .",

    "\\label{sec4 - 90}\\ ] ] for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 one can compare this result with the numerical calculations : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ; @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "we see that @xmath93 and @xmath94 have the same order .",
    "this evaluation should be checked up ( in future investigations ) more carefully as the convergence radius of our expansion - is unknown .",
    "the numerical calculations presented on fig s - show that the @xmath0string approximately can be presented as a finite tube with the constant cross section and a big length joint at the ends with two short tubes which have variable cross section , see fig . .    for the model of the central tube",
    "we take the part of the infinite flux tube solution with @xmath37 @xcite @xmath95 here we have parallel electric @xmath15 and magnetic @xmath16 fields with equal electric @xmath29 and magnetic @xmath26 charges .    for a model of two peripheral ends ( cones )",
    "we take the solution with @xmath44 ( equations - ) . here",
    "we have only the electric field @xmath15 - . at the ends of the @xmath0string ( @xmath96 ) the function @xmath97 and",
    "the term @xmath98 in equations - is zero that allows us to set this term as zero at the peripheral cones .",
    "we have to join the components of metric on the @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 ) .",
    "@xmath101 here @xmath102 and @xmath103 mean that the corresponding quantities are the metric components for @xmath104 and @xmath44 solutions respectively .",
    "according to equations - @xmath105 \\label{sec5 - 60}\\\\     \\tilde{\\tilde{a}}(r_1 ) & = & \\tilde{a}(r_1 ) = a(0 )   \\label{sec5 - 65}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath106 from equation - is replaced with @xmath107 and some coefficient @xmath6 is introduced as equations - with @xmath44 have the terms like @xmath108 and @xmath109 only .",
    "it gives us @xmath110 since for the long @xmath0string @xmath111 .",
    "the next joining is for @xmath112 here the constant term @xmath113 is added to solution @xmath114 since again equations - have @xmath115 and @xmath116 terms only .",
    "consequently @xmath117 the last component of the metric is @xmath118 for the electric field we have @xmath119 and consequently @xmath120 thus our final result for this section is that at the first rough approximation the @xmath0string looks like to a tube with constant cross section and two cones attached to its ends .",
    "in this section we want to present a model of attachment of the @xmath0string to a spacetime .",
    "maybe the most important question for the @xmath0string is : what will see an external observer living in the universe to which the @xmath0string is attached . whether he will see a dyon with electric and magnetic fields or an electric charge ?",
    "this question is not very simple as it is not very clear what is it the electric and magnetic fields on the @xmath0string .",
    "are they the tensor @xmath11 and fields @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xmath123 or something another that is like to an electric displacement @xmath124 and @xmath125 ?",
    "the answer on this question depends on the way how we will continue the solution behind the hypersurface @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 ) .",
    "we have two possibilities : the first way is the simple continuation our solution to @xmath128 , the second way is a string approach - attachment the @xmath0string to a spacetime . in the first case @xmath129 by @xmath130 and @xmath131 by @xmath128",
    "it means that by @xmath128 the time and 5th coordinate @xmath132 becomes respectively space - like and time - like dimensions .",
    "it is not so good for us .",
    "the second approach is like to a string attached to a d - brane .",
    "we believe that physically the second way is more interesting .",
    "let us consider maxwell equations in the 5d kaluza - klein theory @xmath133 here @xmath134 .",
    "these 5d maxwell equations are similar to maxwell equations in the continuous media where the factor @xmath135 is like to a permittivity for @xmath136 equation and a permeability for @xmath137 equations .",
    "it allows us offer the following conditions for matching the electric and magnetic fields at the attachment point of @xmath0 string to the spacetime @xmath138 here the subscript @xmath139 means that this quantity is given on the @xmath0string and on l.h.s there are the quantities belonging to the @xmath0string and on the r.h.s .",
    "the corresponding quantities belong to the spacetime to which we want to attach the @xmath0string . as an example one can join the @xmath0string to the reissner - nordstrm solution with the metric @xmath140 then on the @xmath0string @xmath141 for the reissner - nordstrm solution @xmath142 therefore after joining on the event horizon @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) we have @xmath145 here we took into account that @xmath146 .    for equation",
    "we have @xmath147 on the surface of joining @xmath148 consequently we have very unexpected result : the continuation of @xmath149 ( and magnetic field @xmath150 ) from the @xmath0string to the spacetime ( d - brane ) gives us zero magnetic field @xmath150 .",
    "finally our result for this section is that the @xmath0string can be attached to a spacetime by such a way that it looks like to an electric charge but not magnetic one .",
    "such approach to the geometrical interpretation of electric charges suddenly explain why we do not observe magnetic charges in the world .",
    "in this paper we have considered some interesting properties of the @xmath0string .",
    "we have shown that there is the relation between the metric components .",
    "physically this relation shows that the cross section of @xmath0string is the same order on the interval @xmath151 .",
    "in fact we can choose the cross section as @xmath1 that guarantees us that the cross section of @xmath0string is in planck region everywhere between points @xmath34 where the @xmath0string can be attached to d - branes .",
    "it is shown that in some rough approximation the length of @xmath0string depends logarithmically from a small number which is connected with the difference between @xmath152 .",
    "the calculations presented here give us an additional certainty that the string can have an inner structure and in gravity such string is the @xmath0string .",
    "this approach is similar to einstein point of view that the electron has an inner structure which can be described inside of a gravitational theory as a vacuum topologically non - trivial solution .",
    "another interesting peculiarity is that the gravitational flux tube solutions appear in a relatively simple matter in the classical 5d gravity .",
    "this is in contrast with quantum chromodynamic where receiving a flux tube stretched between quark and antiquark is an unresolved problem . in both cases strings",
    "are some approximation for the tubes .",
    "it is possible that it is a manifestation of some nontrivial mapping between a classical gravity and a quantum field theory .",
    "it is necessary to note that similar idea was presented in ref .",
