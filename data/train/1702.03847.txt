    "the higgs triplet model abbreviated as htm  @xcite has been extensively studied in relation to neutrino mass generation with a non - minimal higgs sector . in higgs triplet models",
    "the sm lagrangian is augmented solely by @xmath2 which is a @xmath3 triplet of scalar particles with hypercharge @xmath4 .",
    "neutrinos may obtain mass via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a neutral higgs boson in an isospin triplet representation .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses is guaranteed by the smallness of the triplet vev which is assumed to be less than 1 gev and the non - conservation of lepton number which is explicitly broken in the scalar potential of the higgs triplet model by a trilinear coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the trilinear coupling @xmath5 is protected by symmetry and is naturally small which assures the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "the model predicts several scalar particles , including a doubly charged higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) and a singly charged higgs boson ( @xmath7 ) , for which direct searches are being carried out at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "apart from these there is a cp odd neutral scalar , @xmath8 and two cp even neutral scalars , h and h. the rest degrees of freedom are absorbed by the vector bosons . in a large part of the parameter space of the htm the lightest cp - even scalar , h ,",
    "has essentially the same couplings to the fermions and vector bosons as the higgs boson of the sm  @xcite . now coming to the loop induced higgs decay ,",
    "@xmath9 would receive additional contributions from the non - standard charged higgs bosons both doubly and singly charged ones .",
    "thus this additional contribution may result in a decay width which matches the present lhc decay width results  @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 which is a quartic coupling in the potential of the higgs triplet model to be discussed very soon , controls the contribution of @xmath6 to the higgs diphoton decay width .",
    "the case of @xmath11 leads to destructive interference between the combined sm contribution ( from w and fermion loops ) and the contribution from @xmath6 as was studied in  @xcite . later on the case for @xmath12",
    "was studied in  @xcite which leads to constructive interference .",
    "in such a situation of constructive interference the production of @xmath6 draws a great deal of attention .",
    "production channels , @xmath1 and @xmath13 were studied extensively in  @xcite .",
    "quartic terms in the scalar potential induce a mass splitting between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be of either sign . if @xmath14 then a new decay channel becomes available for @xmath6 , namely @xmath15 .",
    "another scenario is the case of @xmath16 , which would give rise to a new decay channel for the singly charged scalar , namely @xmath17 .",
    "this decay of singly charged higgs would give rise to an alternative way to produce @xmath6 in pairs , namely by the production mechanism @xmath13 followed by @xmath18 .",
    "this additional sources of pair produced @xmath6 is expected to affect the loop induced higgs diphoton decay , which i have studied in this article .",
    "it will be shown later on that the contribution from @xmath6 is four times compared to that from @xmath7 to the diphoton decay width .",
    "thus the increase in the production of @xmath6 is likely to enhance the decay width more rapidly as compared to the decrement arising from the decay of @xmath7 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath7 is sub - dominant and thus increase in the production of @xmath6 is likely to help us achieve the present lhc bounds on the diphoton decay width .",
    "i have made the same study in the wrong sign limit in which some of the yukawa couplings of the sm like higgs boson are of the opposite sign to that of the vector boson couplings ( wrong sign ) .",
    "the scalar spectrum of the model gets constrained by unitarity and the stability of the potential .",
    "the oblique t - parameter and higgs decay branching ratios , in particular @xmath19 largely depend on the scalar spectrum of the model and thus constraints coming from their experimental values also restrict the scalar spectrum .    in section",
    "ii , i have described the scalar potential and the physical mass eigenstates of the higgs triplet model . section iii deals with the constraints on the parameter space of the model and section iv deals with the diphoton decay width .",
    "additional channels for the production of doubly charged higgs boson have been discussed in section v followed by he numerical analysis of the effect of this additional production of @xmath6 on @xmath20 in section vi . section vii summarizes the article with the results and conclusion .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in a higgs triplet model a y=2 complex @xmath21 isospin triplet of scalar fields , * t * = ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , is added to the sm lagrangian . without the introduction of @xmath21 singlet neutrinos",
    ", majorana masses can be obtained by the observed neutrinos in higgs triplet model .",
    "the below gauge invariant yukawa interaction accomplishes the task .",
    "notation of  @xcite has been followed here in describing the model .",

    "such heavy triplet scalars would be beyond the search limits of lhc .",
    "in the recent years there has been much interest in light triplet scalars(@xmath52 ) within the discovery reach of lhc .",
    "this would lead to @xmath47 being approximately equal to @xmath5 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath47 has to be small basically for two reasons .",
    "first with reference to eq.([neutrino_mass ] ) where the neutrino mass matrix is directly proportional to @xmath47 and thus to preserve the smallness of neutrino masses @xmath47 has to be naturally small .",
    "secondly the case of @xmath53 mev is assumed in the ongoing searches at the lhc , for which the brs of the triplet scalars to leptonic final states ( e.g. @xmath54 ) would be @xmath55 100% .",
    "this fact has been discussed in  @xcite . since @xmath56 for light triplet scalars",
    "then @xmath5 must also be small ( compared to the electroweak scale ) for the scenario of @xmath53 mev .",
    "the @xmath57 parameter ( @xmath58 ) puts an upper bound on @xmath47 . in the sm @xmath59 1 at tree - level , while in the htm it is , @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the measurement @xmath62 leads to the bound @xmath63 , or @xmath64gev .",
    "therefore the vev of the doublet field @xmath65 is essentially equal to the vev of the higgs boson of the sm ( i.e. @xmath66 246 gev ) .",
    "amongst the physical mass eigenstates @xmath6 is entirely composed of the triplet scalar field @xmath67 , while the remaining eigenstates are in general mixtures of the doublet and triplet fields .",

    "while the heavier cp - even higgs , h , the singly charged higgs , @xmath7 and the cp - odd higgs , @xmath8 have predominant contribution from the triplet fields .    neglecting the small off - diagonal elements in the cp - even mass matrix , the approximate expressions for the squared masses of h and h are as follows :    @xmath71    this is same as in the sm .    @xmath72    the squared mass of the doubly charged scalar @xmath6 is ,    @xmath73    the squared mass of the singly charged scalar @xmath7 is ,    @xmath74    the squared mass of the cp - odd scalar @xmath8 is ,    @xmath75    as we can figure out from the above equations that the mass of the sm like higgs boson is unrelated to the rest of the masses and there is a common term in the expressions for the rest of the masses which is @xmath76 . neglecting the terms which are proportional to the small parameter @xmath47 , there are only two possible mass hierarchies for the non - standard scalars , with the magnitude of the mass splitting being controlled by @xmath77 ( and @xmath78 when @xmath47 is neglected ) :    @xmath79",

    "these have been discussed recently in  @xcite .",
    "bsm physics literature have shown the impact of singly charged scalars on the decay @xmath93 as for e.g. in the context of the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm )  @xcite , a two - higgs doublet model  @xcite and the next - to - mssm  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of doubly charged scalars to this decay has received comparatively very little attention .",

    "in addition to the above , the decays @xmath161 and @xmath162 would also provide an additional source of @xmath7 , which can subsequently decay to @xmath6 .",
    "as has been discussed in the previous section that @xmath6 has additional production channels above the standard one , thus this must affect the loop induced higgs diphoton decay width .",
    "now one may be inquisitive that since the additional production of @xmath6 results from the decay of @xmath7 and thus the diphoton decay width will have reduced contribution from @xmath7 and enhanced contribution from @xmath6 .",
    "this can be reasoned out due to a factor of four in case of the contribution from @xmath6 as compared to the contribution from @xmath7 in eq.([decay_width ] ) .",

    "wrong sign limit _ for higgs triplet models .",

    "moreover higher value of @xmath181 is not required to obtain the experimentally obtained enhancement in the relative diphoton decay width .",
    "thus by maintaining a mass hierarchy in the parameter space possibilities for the singly charged scalar to decay to doubly charged scalar have been generated and by choosing a particular range of a quartic coupling , @xmath10 , which controls the contribution of these non - standard charged scalars to the diphoton decay width an enhancement in the diphoton decay width relative to the sm value has been obtained that lies well within the experimental bounds .    the ratio of the diphoton decay width when the down type yukawa coupling have _ wrong sign _ relative to the case with the _ same sign _",
