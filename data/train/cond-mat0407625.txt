    "a useful insight into the dependence of raman intensities on _ @xmath65 _ can be obtained using phenomenological theories of light scattering in the vicinity of a phase transition.@xcite we start with the expression ( [ eq7])and expand the raman tensor into a series with respect to the order parameter :    @xmath66    the change of dielectric permittivity @xmath67   is proportional to the product of @xmath68   and displacement @xmath69 .",
    "the fourier transform of this product can be expressed as :    @xmath70    finally , the intensity of the light scattering is proportional to the statistical average of the square of @xmath71 :    @xmath72    according to this expression , phonons in the entire brillouin zone are excited if @xmath73 .    recent experimental studies of @xmath61-dependence of raman intensities in can have shown that the intensities corresponding to both @xmath54- and @xmath74-related modes vary approximately as square of the order parameter.@xcite in contrast , the intensity of the @xmath53 line exhibited weak dependence on @xmath75 .",
    "these observation can be understood by considering two particular cases of the general expression ( [ i_general ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the case when @xmath60   does not correlate with @xmath61 :    @xmath76    now , we present @xmath68 as the sum of the average order parameter , @xmath77   and its fluctuation @xmath78 :    @xmath79    the second term is finite only in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature , and it is finite even above @xmath80   ( the @xmath81   contribution behaves@xcite as @xmath82    where @xmath83   is the order  disorder phase transition temperature , @xmath84   the annealing temperature ( the equation can be applied to the samples quenched from @xmath85 .",
    "this type of the dependence was experimentally observed for the @xmath54   and @xmath86   related modes in can .",
    "@xcite    now we consider the case when @xmath60   and @xmath61 are strongly correlated and the displacements are modulated by the order parameter :    @xmath87    in particular , the displacements change sign at the antiphase domain boundaries following the change in the sign of the order parameter . so that changing the sign of the order parameter has no effect on the raman intensity . even at the antiphase domain wall , where @xmath61   varies linearly from 1 to 1",
    ", one gets a finite contribution to the intensity .",
    "relation ( [ eq33 ] ) is realized only for those modes which transform similarly to the order parameter . in the symmetry group , @xmath3 ,",
    "only the @xmath53   mode transforms similarly to @xmath88 mode in @xmath89 .    in this case ,",
    "( [ i_general ] ) takes the form :    @xmath90    where @xcite    @xmath91    the first term is temperature independent below @xmath83 and should vanish above @xmath83 .",
    "the second term is negligible in the vicinity of a phase transition ( it varies as @xmath92 ) , and the last two terms are spread over phonon bands ( they are finite above @xmath80 ) .",
    "the third term depends@xcite on @xmath93   as @xmath94 ) .",
    "experimental observations @xcite suggest that , the main contribution to light scattering for the @xmath53   mode comes from the fist term in ( 39 ) and is temperature independent .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath54   and @xmath86   modes obey dependence ( [ square ] ) whereas @xmath53   mode shows mostly constant intensity below @xmath95 .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that the @xmath53   mode transforms in the same way as the chemical order parameter while the @xmath54   and @xmath86   modes transform differently .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath74 modes interact with strains , which can be constructed from the components of the gradient of the order parameter .",
    "this interaction mixes the polarized and depolarized spectra .    in the distorted ( tilted ) structure of can ,",
    "there are raman lines originating presumably from tilting but not from the chemical ordering .",
    "a ferroellastic order parameter should supplement @xmath61 , in this case.@xcite",
    "disorder can cause excitation of the @xmath96-points in the entire brillouin zone.@xcite the contribution of this effect to the width of the raman line is limited by the width of the corresponding phonon band .",
    "we have performed first - principles computation of phonon frequencies for a 80-ion cubic supercell of can ( viena dft package vasp @xcite was used ) and compared the results with those obtained for the tilted 20-ion supercell @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . according to our results , the upper branch of the phonon bands ( which includes the point corresponding to the @xmath53   mode ) has the width of about 70 @xmath51 , which is comparable to the width of the @xmath53   raman line detected experimentally ( about 40 @xmath97 ) .",
    "such narrow width increased only slightly with temperatures approaching @xmath80 , which can be attributed to relatively narrow width of the corresponding phonon band .",
    "this relatively narrow width of the high frequency phonon bands in can can be caused by the band folding due to a doubling of the unit cell upon ordering .",
    "we have performed _ ab initio _ computations of raman intensities for the ab@xmath10b@xmath98o@xmath12 perovskites .",
    "the computation of the raman intensities in cubic can revealed that all raman - active lines , a@xmath99+e@xmath100 + 2f@xmath101 , exhibit large relative intensities in single crystals .",
    "the low - frequency part of the raman spectrum computed for the untilted cubic can structure differs significantly from the corresponding part of the raman spectrum for the tilted monoclinic can .",
    "the intense lines in the cubic structure at 101 @xmath51 shift to higher frequencies , split ( 188 @xmath51 , 242 @xmath102 , and 211 @xmath103,@xcite and become relatively weak .",
    "this is a result of the change in frequency , occupation number , and raman tensor for this line .",
    "the high - frequency @xmath54   line in the cubic structure at 445 @xmath51 splits in the low - symmetry structure into three lines at 446 @xmath51 , 452 @xmath51 and 457 @xmath51.@xcite the relative intensities of these lines decrease in the distorted structure though to a lesser extent than for the low - frequency f@xmath101 line .",
    "e@xmath100 line at 660 @xmath51 splits into two lines at 553 @xmath51 and 554 @xmath51,@xcite and the integral intensity for this line decreases .",
    "a@xmath99 line at 910 @xmath102 in the cubic structure exhibits significant downshift to 797 @xmath51 in the distorted can.@xcite experimentally , this line is observed at higher frequency of 844 @xmath51 .",
    "this discrepancy between the experimental and computed frequencies can be due to the overestimated degree of tilting in the dft computations .",
    "the computed raman intensities agree qualitatively with those observed experimentally . yet , the experiment yields relative integral intensity of the a@xmath99 line larger than the computed value ( mostly due to the larger width ) , and the computed @xmath86 intensity is smaller in the computation in comparison with experiment .",
    "this can be related to the contribution from the scattering on the powder surfaces .",
    "second order raman processes can contribute to the detected line intensity as well .",
    "on the basis of the present first - principles computation we conclude that : ( i ) in agreement with earlier speculations , @xcite high - frequency raman lines appear in ab@xmath5b@xmath6o@xmath12   double perovskites mainly due the ordering of b@xmath104   and b@xmath105   ions ; ( ii ) the modulation of the ionic vibrations by the order parameter in can can explain the weak dependence of the @xmath53   line intensity in can on the annealing temperature when approaching @xmath80 ; ( iii ) our first - principles computation has shown that the width of the high - frequency phonon band is about 70 @xmath97 that can explain the weak dependence of the high - frequency raman lines asymmetry in can on the degree of disorder .",

    "<S> computations performed for both untilted cubic ( @xmath3 ) and tilted monoclinic ( @xmath4 ) can structures showed that the strongest raman lines are associated with the ordering of al and nb . </S>",
    "<S> the computed spectrum agreed qualitatively with the experimental data measured on powder ( can is available in polycrystalline form only ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of cation disorder on the raman intensities was considered using phenomenological theory of light scattering in the vicinity of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that , for certain modes , the corresponding raman intensities depend primarily on the average long range order while , for other modes , the intensities are determined by fluctuations of the order parameter . </S>"
