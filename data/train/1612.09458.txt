    "there is increasing evidence that cloud - cloud collision plays an important role in the high - mass star formation .",
    "based on co observations with the nanten2 4-m telescope , @xcite and @xcite revealed that two giant molecular clouds having a velocity separation of 20@xmath3 are both associated with the hii region rcw49 , which is excited by the massive star cluster westerlund2 .",
    "the large velocity separation can not be interpreted either as the gravitational binding or as the expanding motion driven by the stellar feedback .",
    "an alternative proposed by the authors is a scenario in which the massive cluster was formed by a supersonic collision between the two clouds , where the observed velocity separation can be deemed as the projection of the colliding velocity .",
    "following the discovery in westerlund2 , the association between two clouds of significantly different velocities with o stars were reported in several high - mass star forming regions in the milky way , and triggered o star formation by cloud - cloud collision was discussed as a plausible interpretation ; e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) and @xcite for the galactic hii regions m20 and rcw120 , and @xcite and @xcite for the massive star clusters ngc3603 and rcw38 . in the large magellanic cloud",
    ", alma observations led to the discoveries of a 36@xmath4 star in n159 west and a 40@xmath4 star in n159 east , likely triggered by collisions between filamentary clouds @xcite .",
    "most recently , fukui et al . ( 2016b in prep . )",
    "proposed a scenario that the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) was formed by a collision between two molecular clouds .",
    "these results suggest that cloud - cloud collisions can trigger the formation of o stars for a wide mass range .",
    "m20 and rcw120 are hii regions dominated by a single o star , while westerlund2 , ngc3603 , rcw38 , and the onc are massive star clusters which harbor several or more than ten o stars .",
    "@xcite discussed that h@xmath5 column density of the clouds is a critical parameter to determine the difference and that 10@xmath6@xmath7 is required to form a massive star cluster .",
    "a pioneering study of the numerical calculations of cloud - cloud collision was performed by @xcite , followed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors simulated head - on collisions between two molecular clouds with different sizes .",
    "figure[sch ] shows a schematic picture of high - mass star formation resulting from a cloud - cloud collision between two dissimilar clouds , although the connection between cloud - cloud collision and high - mass star formation was not discussed in depth in the aforementioned simulations .",
    "these authors indicate that cloud - cloud collision can induce the formation of the dense self - gravitating clumps inside the dense gas layer formed at the interface of the collision .",
    "formation of the massive clumps in the collisional - compressed layer was also discussed in depth in the recent magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations by @xcite . in their simulations ,",
    "supersonic collisions amplify the magnetic field and the turbulent velocity of the gas , leading to a mass accretion rate of @xmath8@xmath9yr@xmath10 , two orders of magnitude higher than that in the case of low - mass star formation .",
    "such a high mass accretion rate satisfies the conditions for high mass star formation as postulated in theoretical works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". one interesting signature characteristic to the collision between two dissimilar clouds is the cavity created on the surface of the large cloud .",
    "the size of the cavity corresponds to the diameter of the small cloud , and the depth of the cavity is determined by the timescale of the collision and the balance of the momenta between the two colliding clouds .",
    "an observational support for the cavity creation and the subsequent o star formation predicted in the cloud - cloud collision model was first given by @xcite in the hii region rcw120 .",
    "the authors identified two molecular clouds with a velocity separation of @xmath11 and discussed that the exciting o star inside the rcw120 s bright mid - infrared ring was formed through the collision of the two clouds . the rcw120 s beautiful ring is usually discussed to be formed by the expansion of the hii region .",
    "@xcite however found no evidence of the expanding motion and discussed that the observed ring emission can be interpreted as the cavity created through the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "another observational signature of cloud - cloud collision is the `` bridge feature '' seen in a position - velocity diagram . using the model data of the cloud - cloud collisions calculated by @xcite , @xcite conducted synthetic co line observations and found a broad intermediate velocity feature which bridges between two colliding clouds in the position - velocity diagram .",
    "the bridge feature probes the turbulent motion of the gas enhanced by the collision .",
    "the bridge feature was observationally confirmed in the young massive star cluster rcw38 by @xcite .",
    "it was identified at a spot very nearby the o stars in rcw38 , suggesting that the cloud - cloud collision in rcw38 is still continuing .    among the previously studied cloud - cloud collision regions , m20 ,",
    "also known as the trifid nebula , is the youngest object along with rcw38 ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "it was formed only 0.3myr ago @xcite .",
    "m20 has an outstanding obscuring dust lanes which trisect a nebula of gas ionized by an o7 star ( hd164492a ) , which dominates the excitation of m20 ( figure[opt ] ) .",
    "the distance to m20 estimated in the previous studies ranges from 1.7kpc in the sagittarius arm @xcite to 2.7kpc in the scutum arm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we tentatively assume the distance of 1.7kpc to make our analysis and discussion consistent .",
    "as shown in figure[opt](b ) and talbe[tab:1 ] , hd164492a is accompanied by several early type stars , forming a small stellar group within the central @xmath12pc @xcite .",
    "the total stellar mass within @xmath03pc of hd164492a is about 500@xmath13 @xcite , two orders of magnitude less massive than the massive star clusters like westerlund2 .",
    "low - mass stars at different stages of star formation have been detected throughout the nebula at various wavelengths ; i.e. , optical jets @xcite , mid- and far - infrared young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite , infrared and x - ray ysos @xcite , h@xmath14 emission stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified 85 t - tauri stars in the nebula .",
    "@xcite cataloged @xmath15 ysos based on the _ spitzer _ observations and classified them into different evolutionary stages .",
    "recently , the mystix project utilized the near - infrared and x - ray observations to identify more than 500 ysos in m20 @xcite . in figure[opt](a ) the class 0/i ysos ( red circles ) and the class ii ysos ( white circles ) identified by @xcite are plotted on the optical image of m20 .",
    "@xcite made comparisons between the @xcite s ysos and sub - mm dust continuum emission , indicating that many of the class 0/i ysos are embedded within the dense molecular clumps .",
    "on the other hand , the isocam observations by @xcite unveiled four point - like infrared sources ( dubbed irs2 , irs3 , irs6 , and irs7 ) with bright emission in the 9.7@xmath16 m silicate band , direct evidence of the evaporating disk phase `` proplyd '' , a later evolutionary phase of the star formation ( table[tab:1 ] ) .",
    "irs3 , irs6 , and irs7 are also identified in the @xcite s yso catalog ( see figure[opt](a ) ) .",
    "thanks to the youth of m20 , the natal molecular clouds have been less dissipated by the uv radiation , providing a unique opportunity to investigate the formation mechanism of the o star . in paper",
    "i we made co @xmath2=10 and @xmath2=21 observations with nanten and nanten2 toward a large area of m20 at spatial resolutions of 90@xmath17 and 156@xmath17 , revealing that two molecular clouds with @xmath18@xmath13 having velocity separation of @xmath19 are both physically associated with the hii region in m20 .",
    "the two clouds both have peaks at just the west of hd164492a and have high @xmath20co @xmath2=21/@xmath2=10 line intensity ratios of @xmath01.0 , which corresponds to the kinetic temperature of @xmath030k , indicating heating of the two clouds by hd164492a .",
    "the large velocity separation can neither be explained with gravitational binding by the total mass included in m20 nor the expanding motion driven by the feedback from hd164492a , and paper i concluded that the two molecular clouds collided with each other @xmath21myr ago and triggered the formation of the central o star . although the association of the two clouds with m20 was firmly indicated by the increase of temperature toward the exciting o star , the spatial resolutions of the nanten and nanten2 dataset used in paper i were much coarser than the optical and infrared images obtained toward m20 , and detailed distributions and dynamics of the two colliding clouds have not been studied . in this paper",

    "our new co observations resolve the inner - structures of @xmath38 cloud into several clumpy structures with sizes of 0.20.8pc .",
    "compared with @xmath20co @xmath2=10 , @xmath20co @xmath2=32 highlights these clumpy structures and is not sensitive to the diffuse co emission widely distributed in the @xmath20co @xmath2=10 maps .",
    "@xmath39 cloud consists of several spatially separated clouds as discussed in paper i , where two of them are included in the present observed region .",

    "cloud s is not directly related to the collision ( paper i ) and in this study we do not focus on this cloud , although it has been gaining attention because the optical jet hh399 is protruding from the protostellar core tc2 embedded around the northern tip of cloud s @xcite .",
    "while @xmath38 cloud has overall similar distributions between @xmath20co @xmath2=10 and @xmath20co @xmath2=32 , cloud c has different distributions ; it has only one peak in the @xmath20co @xmath2=10 map ( figure[lb](c ) ) but has four local peaks in the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 map ( figure[lb](d ) ) .    in order to investigate the physical interactions between @xmath38 cloud and cloud c , in figures[channel12 ] and [ channel32 ] we present the @xmath20co @xmath2=10 and @xmath20co @xmath2=32 velocity channel maps over the entire velocity range of the two colliding clouds .",
    "the @xmath20co @xmath2=10 emission in the intermediate velocity range of the two clouds ( 5@xmath44 ) is dominated by relatively weak , diffuse emission widely distributed above declination of @xmath45 , and small scale structures are hardly seen with significant detections .",
    "the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 , on the other hand , shows some clumpy components in the intermediate velocity range free from the diffuse emission .",
    "comparisons of the two colliding clouds and the intermediate velocity gas are shown in figure[lb_comp ] , where the contour maps of @xmath38 cloud ( blue contours ) and @xmath39 cloud ( red contours ) are superimposed on the optical image , and the intermediate velocity features are shown only in the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 map ( figure[lb_comp](b ) ) in green contours .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath38 cloud is consistent with the dark lanes observable against the bright nebular background in the optical . on the other hand ,",
    "cloud c has no correspondence with the optical image and is likely located in the rear of the nebula .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath38 cloud and cloud c have complementary distribution ; cloud c is sandwiched between the eastern component and the western component of @xmath38 cloud .",
    "the clumpy structures at the intermediate velocity range basically trace the gas distribution of @xmath38 cloud .",
    "we find that three of the clumpy structures , dubbed as br1 , br2 , and br3 in figure[lb_comp](b ) , can be identified as the bridge features which connect between @xmath38 cloud and cloud c in velocity space .",
    "this can be seen in the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 declination - velocity diagrams in figure[vb ] .",
    "figure[channel_ratio ] shows the velocity channel maps of the @xmath20co @xmath2=32/@xmath2=10 intensity ratio ( hereafter @xmath46 ) , where the color shows @xmath46 and contours indicate the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 distribution .",
    "the two colliding clouds and the intermediate velocity gas have high @xmath46 of larger than 1.0 , up to over 2.0 , throughout the present target region . that both the @xmath38 and @xmath39 cloud ( cloud c and cloud s ) are highly excited was already discussed in paper i by taking ratios of @xmath20co @xmath2=21/@xmath2=10 ( @xmath47 ) at a larger angular resolution of 4@xmath48 .",
    "the large velocity gradient analysis in paper i indicates that these high @xmath47 gas is attributed to high kinetic temperature of the gas such as over 20k , which is significantly higher than the typical gas temperature of 10k in the galactic disk without heating , and following the discussion in paper i , the high @xmath46 in clouds in m20 can also be interpreted as high gas temperature with @xmath49k .",
    "it is reasonable to deem that such high kinetic temperature is due to heating by hd164492a , illumination of the strong uv radiation and/or physical interaction with the ionized gas in the hii region .",
    "the disruptive feedback effects become more efficient at the neighborhood of hd164492a , and indeed the gas at the central a few pc of hd164492a has been completely dissipated as seen in figure[opt](b ) , where the central stellar group including hd164492a is cleared from gas and dust , and is surrounded by the curved dark lane with a radius of 0.20.3pc .",
    "the northern part of the surrounding dark lane has a bright rim at its southern border , indicating the illumination by the strong uv radiation from hd164492a .",
    "a molecular counterpart of the dark lane is seen in @xmath38 cloud at 0.5@xmath50 as shown in figure[hole](a ) .",
    "in addition , we found another hole in cloud c at 8.5@xmath51 as seen in figure[hole](b ) .",
    "different from the ( incomplete ) hole in @xmath38 cloud , the hole in cloud c is closed with a radius of @xmath21pc , consistent with that in the hole in @xmath38 cloud .",
    "although its center does not coincide with hd164492a ( it is shifted toward the south - west from hd164492a by @xmath12pc ) , it is reasonable to deem that the second hole was also made by the feedback from hd164492a .",
    "this offers another support for the coexistence of @xmath38 cloud and cloud c within the m20 nebula .",
    "associations of the infrared sources with the molecular clouds are investigated with the the velocity channel maps in figures[channel12 ] , [ channel32 ] , and [ channel_ratio ] .",
    "we found five infrared sources which show coincidence with the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 clumps ( see arrows in figure[channel32 ] ) .",
    "three of them are the ysos toward the dense dust cores tc1 , tc2 , and tc8 , and associations of the class 0/i ysos with these cores were discussed in @xcite .",
    "tc1 and tc8 are seen in @xmath38 cloud , and tc2 is in cloud s in @xmath39 cloud .",
    "note that tc2 corresponds to the bridge feature br3 as seen in figure[lb_comp ] .",
    "on the other hand , associations of the compact co emission toward the remaining two sources , which corresponds to irs6 and irs7 , were not found in the dust continuum observations in @xcite .",
    "these authors discussed that irs6 and irs7 are in latest stages of early stellar evolution when the parental envelope of the newly born stars has been almost fully photoevaporated , and hence the enhancement of the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 emission toward these two sources may be attributed to high temperature of the remaining parental gas .",
    "our new co data obtained with the aste and mopra telescopes have revealed that :    1 .   from heating signatures , @xmath38 cloud and cloud c are both located in the vicinity of m20 .",
    "however they are both associated with distinct features of m20 .",
    "@xmath38 cloud which coincides with the dark lanes are in front of the nebula along the line - of - sight , while @xmath39 cloud is in the rear .",
    "@xmath38 cloud and cloud c show complementary distributions .",
    "cloud c is located at the gap between the eastern component and the western component of @xmath38 cloud .",
    "3 .   in the position - velocity diagrams , @xmath38 cloud and cloud c are connected with each other by the bridge features .",
    "we identified three bridge features br1 , br2 , and br3 with the @xmath20co @xmath2=32 data .      in order to interpret these observational signatures ,",
    "we here make comparisons with the theoretical works on cloud - cloud collision .",
    "@xcite calculated collisions between two bonnor ebert spheres of different size , seeded with turbulence .",
    "the surface density plots of the collision model with a colliding velocity of @xmath52 are shown in figures[model](a ) and [ model](b ) .",
    "the velocity separation of the two colliding clouds in m20 is measured as @xmath19 .",
    "considering the viewing angle of the collision , @xmath52 is a reasonable assumption of the colliding velocity in m20 .",

    "@xcite carried out synthetic co observations with the takahira et al.s @xmath52 collision model .",
    "the authors postprocessed the data shown in figure[model](b ) with the torus radiation transport and hydrodynamics code and produced synthetic @xmath20co @xmath2=10 cube data with @xmath53 axes ( see @xcite for the detailed set - ups ) .",

    "the two clouds seen in the position - velocity map are separated by @xmath56 , which indicates the deceleration of the colliding velocity , and the bridge features which connect the two clouds are seen at the intermediate velocity range ( @xmath57@xmath58 ) .    in figure[model_3col",

    "it is seen that the bridge feature is the turbulent gas which is excited at the thin boundary between the small cloud ( = dense layer inside the cavity ) and the large cloud .",
    "@xcite discussed that the turbulence as well as the magnetic field can increase the effective jeans mass to orders of magnitude above the thermal jeans mass , leading to mass accretion rates high enough to form massive stars .",
    "although the calculations by @xcite did not include the magnetic fields , the thin turbulent layer at the interface of the two colliding cloud may provide sites of the high - mass star formation .",

    "the large cloud overall has a ring - like distribution , which is due to the cavity created by the collision as seen in figure[model](b ) . the small cloud which corresponds to the dense compressed layer which is caving the large cloud is compact and bright in the co emission .",
    "the bridge feature , or the thin turbulent layer at the interface of the collision , consists of several filamentary structures having widths ranging from 0.2pc to 1pc . for comparisons , a three color composite image of the small cloud ( blue ) , the bridge feature ( green ) , and the large cloud ( red )",
    "is presented in figure[model_th](d ) .",
    "interestingly , the small cloud coincides with the inside of the ring of the large cloud , showing complementary distribution between the two colliding clouds .",

    "the bridge feature can be distinguished as a flattened profile from the emission of the two colliding clouds .",
    "these characteristic features seen in the numerical calculations of cloud - cloud collision , i.e. , the complementary distribution of the two colliding clouds , the bridge feature at the intermediate velocity range , and its flattened co spectrum , can be seen in the present co @xmath2=10 and @xmath2=32 observations .",

    "the profiles of the br1 and br2 spectra are similar to the model profile in the point b in figure[modelspec ] , which has a flattened profile at the intermediate velocity range , while the profile in br3 looks similar to that at point a. all of these observed signatures lend strong support for the cloud - cloud collision scenario in m20 .",
    "we note that the numerical calculations by @xcite do not include the magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the magnetic field plays a critical role to form the dense cores in the turbulent layer at the interface of the collision .",

    "in addition , the present spatial resolutions of the aste and mopra data are not high enough to resolve the bridge features in m20 to investigate the filamentary inner - structures as seen in the model data ( figure[model_th](b ) ) . however , it is interesting to note that the dark dust lanes seen in the optical image in figure[opt ] show entangled filamentary structures toward the complementary distribution between @xmath38 cloud and cloud c. future alma observations will allow us to investigate the inner - structures of the colliding regions to make detailed comparisons with the theoretical works to reproduce the dense clumps , precursors of the o stars .      in table[tab ]",

    "the masses of @xmath38 cloud and cloud c in m20 are each estimated to be @xmath64@xmath4 for an assumed distance of 1.7kpc , respectively , where we assume an x - factor , the empirical conversion factor from the integrated intensity of @xmath20co @xmath2=10 to the h@xmath5 column density , of @xmath65@xmath7(kkms@xmath10)@xmath10 @xcite .",

    "@xcite discussed that h@xmath5 column density is the critical parameter in the cloud - cloud collision scenario which determines the difference between the formation of single o star and massive star clusters , and @xmath67@xmath7 is the threshold to form the massive star clusters such as rcw38 via cloud - cloud collision . our results in m20 , which harbors one single o star , are consistent with the discussion by @xcite . compared with other regions listed in table[tab ]",
    ", m20 is the case in which the masses and the column densities of the colliding clouds are smallest , although the classification of the formed o star is earlier than the o8v or o9v star in rcw120 .",
    "timescale of the cloud - cloud collision in m20 can be calculated with the physical separation and the relative velocity of the two colliding clouds .",
    "since @xmath38 cloud and cloud c are both embedded within the hii region of m20 , the distance between the two clouds are limited to be within 34pc , which is the size of the nebula in m20 .",
    "if we tentatively assume a viewing angle of the collision in m20 as 45@xmath68 , the relative velocity of the two colliding clouds is @xmath69 , then the timescale of the collision is estimated to be less than 0.30.4myr , which is consistent with the age of m20 measured from the size of the hii region by @xcite .",
    "formation of the low - mass stars is another intriguing topic in m20 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed that the filaments which trisect the optical nebula in m20 were probably self - gravitating too before the birth of m20 , and that the fragmentation of the filament which may lead to the yso formation can be accounted for by mhd - driven instabilities , not by the shock interactions with the expanding hii region .",
    "the growth timescale of the mhd instabilities is estimated to be as large as 1myr , suggesting that the fragmentation would have started before the onset of the photoionization .",
    "however , it may well be that the fragmentation occurred at an early evolutionary stage of the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "this hypothesis raises a possibility that the cloud - cloud collision which triggered the formation of hd164492a might accelerate the subsequent formation and evolution of the cores in the fragments .",
    "it should be interesting to note a speculation that this is the case in the cold dust core tc1 in the eastern lane of the filaments , which harbors a class 0/i yso @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the bridge feature br3 is spatially well correlated with tc1 as shown in figure[lb_comp ] .",
    "the existence of the bridge feature indicates the existence of the turbulent gas excited by the cloud - cloud collision , suggesting a possibility that the tc2 core evolved under the condition affected by the cloud - cloud collision , although we can not exclude that the central object of tc2 was already well evolved before the collision .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "we performed high resolution co @xmath2=10 and co @xmath2=32 observations toward the two colliding molecular clouds in the galactic hii region m20 with mopra and aste .",
    "the two clouds are resolved into details , allowing us to make direct comparisons with the optical image of m20 .",
    "we identified two peculiar molecular gas structures in the two colliding clouds , @xmath38 cloud and cloud c. one is the spatially complementary distribution .",
    "cloud c coincides with the gap at the center of @xmath38 cloud and appears to being sandwiched by the eastern component and the western component of @xmath38 cloud .",
    "the other is the bridge feature which connects the two clouds in velocity space .",
    "we identified three bridge features br1br3 .",
    "they are located around the sides of cloud c. these structures strongly indicates that , although they are separated by @xmath19 , the two colliding clouds are physically associated with each other .",
    "3 .   in order to interpret these observed structures",
    ", we make a new analysis on the model co @xmath2=10 data generated by @xcite with the @xmath52 collision model calculated in @xcite . as a result",
    ", we reproduce the similar gas structures found in the present observations such as the complementary distributions and the bridge features , where the complementary distribution can be accounted for by the cavity created by the collision between two dissimilar clouds and the bridge feature as the turbulent gas excited in the thin layer at the interface of the collision .",
    "our new results lend support for the cloud - cloud collision scenario in m20 .",
