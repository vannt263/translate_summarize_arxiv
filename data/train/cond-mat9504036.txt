    "electronic systems with strong randomness and strong interactions  @xcite have been studied in a number of experimental systems including doped semiconductors , metallic alloys , and most recently in the doped cuprate and doped heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "some of the most interesting physics in these materials arises from the complex interplay of the fermionic , charge - carrying excitations and the spin fluctuations .",
    "a number of distinct equilibrium thermodynamic phases are possible , even at zero temperature ( @xmath2 ) . in the charge sector",
    ", we may have metallic and insulating phases ( within the insulator we may also distinguish further between a mott insulator , with a true @xmath3 charge gap , and a fermi glass , which has localized , gapless , charged excitations ) . in the spin sector , the ground state can either be a spin glass , in which each spin has an infinite - time memory of its spatially random moment , or a quantum paramagnet , in which the spin correlations decay to zero in the long - time limit .",
    "there does not appear to be any fundamental principle constraining the relative positions of the transitions in the charge and spin sectors , leading to a rich phenomenology of possible @xmath3 phases and critical points .",
    "previous work has examined the quantum paramagnet phase both in the mott insulator  @xcite ( where the spin fluctuations can be described by a quantum heisenberg spin model ) and the metal  @xcite .",
    "studies of the spin glass phase and its onset have however been mostly restricted to the insulating phase . in an infinite - range heisenberg model of the mott insulator an instability of the quantum paramagnet to a possible spin glass",
    "was noted  @xcite .",
    "greater progress has been made in elucidating the quantum paramagnet to spin glass transition in insulating models of ising spins in a transverse field ( which may be appropriate for insulators with strong crystalline anisotropy ) and quantum rotors  @xcite .",
    "the methodology of a recently developed landau theory for this transition in the ising and rotor models  @xcite will be very useful to us below .    in this paper",
    ", we shall analyze systems in the vicinity of a @xmath3 transition between a spin glass and a quantum paramagnet occurring while the charge sector is _ metallic .",
    "_ our motivation for this study comes partly from recent experiments in heavy fermion compounds like @xmath4  @xcite which appear to show a paramagnet to spin glass transition with increasing doping ( @xmath5 ) in a metallic regime .",
    "however , we shall not make comparisons of our theory with experiments here , as detailed studies of the vicinity of the quantum transition are not yet available .",
    "we will begin by introducing in section  [ model ] a quantum field - theory , @xmath6 , for metallic spin glasses ; our approach suggests the identification `` spin density glass '' for such systems . in section  [ mft ]",
    "we will determine the mean field phase diagram of @xmath6 as a function of a quantum coupling , temperature , and an external magnetic field .",
    "fluctuations about mean field will be studied in section  [ fluct ] , first by a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) analysis ( section  [ rg ] ) , which finds flows to strong - coupling for spatial dimensions @xmath7 .",
    "these results will then be used ( section  [ scaling ] ) to motivate a scaling scenario for the strong - coupling region in which the critical fixed point involves only _",
    "static _ fluctuations induced by the quenched randomness .",
    "dynamic , quantum fluctuations are dangerously irrelevant at this static fixed point , and their effects are controlled by a crossover exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the critical singularity of the non - linear susceptibility , @xmath9 , is weakened by a positive @xmath10 , thus a non - divergent , cusp - like , critical singularity in @xmath9 is possible .",
    "this scaling scenario generalizes one proposed earlier for insulating ising and rotor spin glasses  @xcite which had @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , there is no fundamental reason why the insulating spin glasses should not also have @xmath12 .",
    "static , or @xmath13 , fixed points have also arisen in studies of some other spin systems .",
    "a model of quantum rotors in a random field was studied some time ago by boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite , and their results can be interpreted in terms of such a fixed point .",
    "however , they did not realize that the crossovers , and positions of phase boundaries , at finite @xmath2 are modified by a positive @xmath10 ; the required modification is related to that discussed by weichmann _ et .",
    "@xcite and millis  @xcite in a rather different physical context , and will also be discussed in this paper .",
    "more recently , d.  fisher  @xcite has studied the random ising model in a transverse field in @xmath14 and shown that the results are consistent with a @xmath13 fixed point : his scaling results however involve an exponential relationship between energy and length scales , unlike the more usual power law relationship which we shall find .",
    "finally , in very recent work , kirkpatrick and belitz  @xcite have proposed a scaling scenario for the metal - insulator transition which appears to have many similarities to our results below on the metallic spin glass to paramagnet transition .",
    "an initial analysis of metallic spin glasses was performed some time ago by hertz  @xcite , although he did not focus on the vicinity of the @xmath3 quantum transition .",
    "we will study models , similar to those in ref  @xcite , described by the following class of hamiltonians : @xmath15 where @xmath16 annihilates an electron on site @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 , and the spin operator @xmath19 with @xmath20 the pauli matrices .",
    "the sites @xmath21 lie on a @xmath22-dimensional lattice , the hopping matrix elements @xmath23 are short - ranged and possibly random , and the @xmath24 are gaussian random exchange interactions , possibly with spin anisotropies .",
    "the remainder @xmath25 includes other possible short - range interactions between the electrons : we constrain them so that the ground state of @xmath26 is metallic .",
    "a version of @xmath26 with infinite - range hopping and exchange was studied recently  @xcite using a static ansatz for the order parameter but with no additional approximations .",
    "we will provide below a theory which includes dynamic , quantum effects and also applies to models with finite - range interactions in finite dimensions .",
    "our analysis of @xmath26 will be similar in spirit to the stoner model approaches to the appearance of spin - density - wave order in clean metallic systems  @xcite , except that we now consider condensation into a density wave with a random orientation of spins , or a `` spin density glass '' .",
    "we now discuss the physical significance of the couplings in @xmath6 ; for more details the reader is referred again to ref  @xcite and we highlight only the main points here . first note that there are more terms than coupling constants , but it is easy to check that rescalings of @xmath5 and @xmath47 always allow one to reach the form chosen .",
    "the coupling @xmath40 multiplies what turns out to be `` thermal operator '' which tunes the system across the transition .",
    "the important non - linearity is the cubic @xmath48 coupling which is induced by disorder effects and involves no exchange of energy between the @xmath33 fields ; there is a @xmath49 in the linear term to ensure that the bare @xmath33 propagator is independent of @xmath48 .",
    "the only terms involving energy exchange are the quadratic @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms which represent the `` quantum - mechanical '' interactions between the fermions .",
    "finally , the @xmath52 term in @xmath6 represents disorder fluctuation effects and arises from fluctuations in the local position of the critical point as determined by @xmath40 .",
    "we now consider the mean field ( or tree - level ) properties of @xmath6 .",
    "we will only consider two extreme limits of the spin anisotropy  ising - like , when @xmath53 , and heisenberg - like , when @xmath54 .",
    "we will drop the vector @xmath39 index except where necessary , and represent the effective number of components by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for the ising case , and @xmath57 for the heisenberg case ) .    in ref  @xcite we found that , as in the classical spin glass , a theory with only a cubic non - linearity was replica symmetric , even in the spin glass phase ; replica symmetry breaking appeared only upon including a certain quartic coupling which was formally irrelevant at the quantum critical point .",
    "much of this structure carries over unchanged to the metallic spin glass , and we shall not dwell on it here .",
    "we will restrict our considerations to the replica symmetric theory which contains all of the dynamic effects which lead to the important differences between metallic and insulating spin glasses .",
    "we therefore make the following replica - symmetric , @xmath5-independent ansatz for the mean field value of @xmath33 : in matsubara frequencies ( which are integral multiples of @xmath58 as usual ) we write @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the local dynamic spin susceptibility ( we will absorb a factor of @xmath62 into @xmath2 from here on ) .",
    "the first term is the spin glass order parameter ",
    "note that it is independent of replica indices , and , therefore , the replica diagonal and off - diagonal components of @xmath63 are equal and @xmath64 . in a theory with only a cubic non - linearity ( to which we shall restrict ourselves here ) the equality of all the replica components of @xmath63 holds at all @xmath2 ; upon including higher - order terms in @xmath6 , the equality between all the replica components persists at @xmath3 , but there are thermal corrections at any non - zero @xmath2 which distinguish the diagonal and off - diagonal components and which also break replica symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we now insert ( [ ansatz ] ) into @xmath6 and determine the saddle point .",
    "this determines the spin glass to paramagnet phase boundary at @xmath65 and the order parameter @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is dependent on the large frequency cutoff @xmath70 ( see fig  [ phasediag ] ) .",
    "the local , dynamic spin susceptibility has imaginary part @xmath71 note that the spin fluctuations are gapless , and the crossover from paramagnetic to critical fluctuations occurs at a frequency scale @xmath72 ; @xmath72 also determines the correlation length @xmath73 that appears in spatial correlation functions , which can be found as gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point .",
    "the value of @xmath72 has a rather complicated dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath74 and we describe its limiting behavior in the five different regimes of fig  [ phasediag]there are smooth crossovers between these regimes . within the spin glass phase , we have @xmath75 , @xmath76 everywhere and there are no crossovers in the present approximation .",
    "however , we expect that there will be a crossover between a region characterized by the quantum ground state ( i ) to a region dominated by thermal , critical fluctuations ( ii ) and such a crossover boundary has been shown in fig  [ phasediag ] . in the paramagnetic phase",
    "the present approximation is much richer , and shows all the expected crossovers .",
    "the scale @xmath72 is determined by the equation @xmath77 solution of ( [ deltaeqn ] ) yields four different regimes of behavior ( ii - v ) which we describe in turn .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath78 : this is closest to the phase boundary , and is the region with classical fluctuations .",
    "we have @xmath79note that @xmath72 depends on the _ square _ of the distance @xmath80 from the transition ( as shown in ref  @xcite , this is crucial for obtaining the classical exponent @xmath81 ) .",
    "+ ( iii ) @xmath82 : this is the ` quantum - critical ' region in that @xmath2 is the most significant energy scale and the system behaves as if it is at the critical coupling @xmath83 .",
    "here we find , to lowest order in @xmath84 that @xmath85 .",
    "note that the expected quantum - critical scaling @xmath86  @xcite is violated .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that all @xmath2 dependent corrections are controlled by quantum interactions @xmath84 which are irrelevant at the critical point ( see below)in other words @xmath12 spoils the naive @xmath87 scaling .",
    "a similar interpretation can be given to the position of the phase boundary @xmath88 .",
    "+ ( iv ) @xmath89 _ and _ ( v ) @xmath90 : these are the ` quantum - disordered ' regions in that @xmath2 dependent corrections are secondary and to leading order in @xmath91 we have @xmath92 .",
    "the subleading terms in @xmath72 are different in the two regimes : in regime iv , @xmath93 , while in regime v , @xmath94 .",
    "this subdivision of the quantum - disordered region is similar to that found in a different context in ref  @xcite , and is also a consequence of the dangerous irrelevancy of @xmath84 .",
    "all of the above crossover boundaries and exponents are of course characteristics of the mean field theory , which can , in general , be modified by fluctuations  we will indicate the nature of these modifications in the discussion in section  [ scaling ] .",
    "we complete our discussion of mean field theory by discussing the effect of an external magnetic field , @xmath95 on @xmath6 .",
    "the additional terms induced by @xmath26 can be determined following refs  @xcite which examined the effects of @xmath26 on spin - density wave formation in clean systems  by this method",
    "we found @xmath96 the field has several different competing effects .",
    "the first term , proportional to the coupling @xmath97 , is the static paramagnetic susceptibility of the fermions which polarizes the spins along the field , and which always dominates at small @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath98 terms account for the precession of the spins in the plane perpendicular to @xmath99 and the energetic contribution of quantum fluctuations about the static spin directions : as in clean antiferromagnets  @xcite we expect these terms to prefer magnetic order in a plane perpendicular to @xmath26 ( and so @xmath100 ) .",
    "we now consider some cases separately : + ( _ i _ ) _ ising spins , @xmath26 along easy - axis_only the term proportional to @xmath97 in ( [ field ] ) need be considered as the @xmath98 terms are never important .",
    "the finite field phase diagram , the field dependence of observables , and the position of the almeida - thouless boundary  @xcite , are essentially identical to that for the insulating ising model considered earlier  @xcite , and will therefore not be considered here .",
    "the only difference in the metallic case is that no logarithms are present_e.g . _",
    "the free energy at @xmath83 and @xmath3 that depended on @xmath26 as @xmath101 in ref  @xcite , here varies as @xmath102 .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) _ ising spins , @xmath26 perpendicular to easy - axis_now the @xmath97 term in ( [ field ] ) couples only to non - critical components of @xmath33 and is not important ; after integrating out the non - critical @xmath33 we find that the main consequence of the @xmath98 terms is to induce a shift @xmath103 in the position of the critical point .",
    "+ ( _ iii _ ) _ heisenberg spins_in finite field we now have to allow for the possibility of spin glass order appearing in the plane perpendicular to @xmath26 ; the onset of this order is the gabay - toulouse transition at @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "let us take a field @xmath26 pointing along the @xmath105 direction .",
    "the subsequent mean field theory is most convenient in a circularly - polarized basis for the vector components of @xmath33 : we take @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and all other vector components of @xmath109 .",
    "we make the same ansatz as in ( [ ansatz ] ) for the frequency and replica dependence of @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 by introducing the quantities @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 _ etc._. it is then not difficult to solve the resulting mean field equations . it is slightly more convenient to approach the gabay - toulouse boundary from the gabay - toulouse phase with spin glass order in the transverse direction : @xmath116 .",
    "the solution of the mean field equations for this case are @xmath117 where the gabay toulouse spin glass order parameter @xmath118 and the frequency scale @xmath72 are determined by the solutions of the two equations @xmath119 the gabay - toulouse boundary is determined by imposing the condition @xmath120 on these two equations , which gives us a line @xmath121 in the @xmath122 plane .",
    "the result of such a computation at @xmath3 , is shown in fig  [ gt ] . for small @xmath26 , the first term in ( [ field ] )",
    "dominates and we find @xmath123 . for large @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath98 terms take over , and for @xmath100 we find that @xmath124 turns over and extends to @xmath125 as @xmath126 ( see fig  [ gt ] ) ; for sufficiently negative @xmath127 this turn over will not occur .",
    "we begin by a perturbative rg analysis of fluctuations , which will unfortunately not be of much direct utility as there is runaway flow to strong coupling below @xmath128 . nevertheless , the structure of this analysis will help motivate a general scaling scenario which we will describe subsequently .",
    "the perturbative rg analysis is quite similar to that of ref  @xcite .",
    "the main difference at tree level will be that the dynamic exponent @xmath129 is @xmath130 rather than @xmath131 .",
    "this difference has the important consequence of now making the @xmath84 couplings dangerously irrelevant , which in turn leads to a positive @xmath10 .",
    "the rg begins with the rescalings @xmath132 the exponents @xmath133 have their usual meaning , while @xmath134 is introduced to allow for violations of hyperscaling : we will have @xmath135 causing @xmath136 to flow to 0 , and behave as a dangerously irrelevant variable .",
    "the irrelevant coupling @xmath136 and its exponent @xmath134 , should not be confused with the couplings controlling quantum - mechanical effects and the exponent @xmath10 which will be discussed momentarily . at tree level ( or equivalently , at the gaussian fixed point ) , the above rescalings leave @xmath6 invariant provided we modify the couplings @xmath137 and choose the exponents @xmath138 thus the cubic non - linearity @xmath48 becomes relevant for @xmath22 below @xmath139 , and the rescaling of @xmath74 gives us the gaussian exponent @xmath140 ; note the correlation length is given by @xmath141 in the notation of section  [ mft ] . the most important point , and",
    "the key difference from ref  @xcite , is that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are now irrelevant with exponent @xmath142 . as these are the only couplings associated with quantum effects , we introduce a new crossover exponent , @xmath143 which will control the ` dangerously irrelevant ' consequences of quantum fluctuations .",
    "at tree level we clearly have @xmath144 .",
    "finally , note that for @xmath22 above 8 , @xmath48 also becomes dangerously irrelevant about the gaussian fixed point .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the above analysis to include one - loop diagrams . using the diagrams discussed in ref  @xcite , we find ( @xmath145 ) @xmath146 and the flow equations @xmath147 we have absorbed various phase - space factors into the couplings ( see  @xcite ) , and @xmath148 is an uninteresting positive constant .",
    "the irrelevant couplings @xmath84 were set equal to 0 at the outset .",
    "there is no stable fixed point of ( [ rgeqn ] ) for real @xmath48 below @xmath128 . above @xmath128 ,",
    "the gaussian fixed point is stable , but its domain of attraction is limited to a region which vanishes as @xmath22 approaches 8 from above . for @xmath149 , and for all physical initial conditions ,",
    "the coupling @xmath48 flows to strong coupling , making quantitative computation of exponents impossible in the present approach .",
    "we will now discuss a non - perturbative scaling scenario for quantum spin glasses , assuming that the structure of the dangerously irrelevant variables remains similar to that found in the perturbative analysis above .",
    "we will consider a _ static _",
    "strong - coupling critical theory with two dangerously irrelevant directions : one associated with a coupling analogous to @xmath136 which controls disorder fluctuation effects and has exponent @xmath150 , and a second associated with dynamic , quantum mechanical effects ( couplings @xmath84 ) and exponent @xmath143 . in the previous analysis of insulating spin glasses",
    "@xcite only @xmath136 , the first of these dangerously irrelevant couplings , was present ; our present scaling relations reduce to the earlier ones upon putting @xmath11 .",
    "as we shall see below , a positive @xmath10 has new and important physical consequences .",
    "although the analysis below is clearly motivated by our mean field theory of metallic spin glasses above , there is no fundamental reason why the insulating models considered in ref  @xcite should not also have @xmath12 .",
    "it is helpful to discuss non - perturbative effects by considering the scaling behavior of observable correlation functions . among two - point correlators of @xmath33 , there are three independent observables  @xcite : in the paramagnetic phase these are the spin glass susceptibility , @xmath151 , @xmath152 \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\lim_{n \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{1}{n(n-1 ) } \\sum_{a\\neq b,\\mu\\nu } \\left\\langle\\left\\langle q^{ab}_{\\mu\\nu } ( x , \\tau_1 , \\tau_3 ) q^{ab}_{\\mu\\nu } ( y , \\tau_2 , \\tau_4 ) \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle \\label{defgd2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the double angular brackets represent averages with a replicated , translationally invariant action like @xmath6 ) ; the quantum mechanically disconnected correlator , @xmath153 , @xmath154 - \\mbox{subtractions } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\lim_{n \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{1}{n(n-1 ) } \\sum_{a\\neq b } \\left\\langle\\left\\langle q^{aa}_{\\mu\\mu } ( x , \\tau_1 , \\tau_2 ) q^{bb}_{\\nu\\nu } ( y , \\tau_3 , \\tau_4 ) \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle -\\cdots;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the connected correlation function , @xmath155 , @xmath156 -\\mbox{subtractions } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\lim_{n \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{a } \\left\\langle\\left\\langle q^{aa}_{\\mu\\nu } ( x , \\tau_1 , \\tau_2 ) q^{aa}_{\\rho\\sigma } ( y , \\tau_3 , \\tau_4 ) \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle -\\cdots . \\label{defgc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the non - linear susceptibility , @xmath9 , is given by the integral over space and time of @xmath155 .",

    "we may conclude from arguments similar to those in ref  @xcite that @xmath153 and @xmath151 scale as @xmath157 for fixed @xmath158 at criticality .",
    "the scaling dimensions of @xmath151 and @xmath153 differ because @xmath151 carries a prefactor of the dangerously irrelevant variable @xmath136 , while @xmath153 does not .",
    "finally , @xmath155 carries a prefactor of @xmath136 , and an additional prefactor of the irrelevant quantum interactions : hence @xmath159 indeed , one can consider the 3 equations ( [ gdeq])-([gceq ] ) as the definition of the three independent exponents @xmath160 , @xmath134 , and @xmath10 . in the previous analysis",
    "@xcite , @xmath11 and hence @xmath151 and @xmath155 had the same scaling dimension . by taking the spacetime integral of ( [ defgc ] ) , we can deduce that the non - linear susceptibility @xmath9 behaves as @xmath161 near the @xmath3 quantum critical point .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath10 , @xmath9 need not diverge .",

    "consider a correlator of the @xmath33 fields in which all external frequencies have been fixed at the same frequency @xmath45 . as the critical field theory is static , and because the @xmath33 field is bilocal in time , @xmath45 will act simply as an external source which shifts the value of the `` thermal '' coupling @xmath189 , as is apparent from the first two terms in @xmath6 ; for insulating ising and rotor models the corresponding shift is @xmath190 . as the scaling dimension of @xmath74 is @xmath191 , this gives us the scaling relation @xmath192 we emphasize that both results rely on the assumption of a static critical theory ; this assumption was not made in the analysis of ref  @xcite .",
    "we also note in passing that the present argument fixing the value of @xmath129 can not be applied to the random - field quantum rotor model of ref  @xcite ( which also had a static critical point ) , because the same external frequency @xmath45 does not flow through all internal propagators in this case , and some propagators are always at zero frequency .",
    "we now ask whether there is a _ classical _ statistical mechanics field theory which is also described by the static critical point postulated above .",
    "we are only able to answer this question within the confines of perturbation theory : a perturbative expansion in @xmath48 suggests that the relevant field theory is that describing singularities along the imaginary field , @xmath193 , axis in a @xmath22-dimensional randomly diluted ising ferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "the latter model has a yang - lee edge singularity  @xcite at the same value , @xmath194 as the non - diluted ising ferromagnet  @xcite .",

    "the field theory for this singularity is  @xcite : @xmath199 +   \\frac{1}{2t^2 } \\sum_{ab } \\phi^a ( x ) \\phi^{b } ( x ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath200 is the replicated order parameter for the ising model .",
    "this field theoretic model was also considered earlier by parisi and sourlas  @xcite , who argued that for @xmath48 _ imaginary _ , @xmath201 describes the statistics of lattice animals .",
    "as we will argue shortly , the perturbative rg equations for @xmath201 are given precisely by ( [ rgeqn ] ) , and a perturbative fixed point with @xmath48 imaginary can indeed be obtained in the @xmath202 expansion . however , in this paper we are only interested in the case of @xmath48 real , which also describes the ` pseudo yang - lee edge '  @xcite in a random ising ferromagnet .",
    "now we discuss the perturbative connection between models defined by @xmath203 and @xmath6 .",
    "consider the feynman graph expansions with the action @xmath203 for the correlators @xmath204 compare this with the feynman graph expansion with the action @xmath6 of _ zero frequency _",
    "correlators @xmath151 and @xmath153 respectively .",
    "it is not difficult to show , term by term , that these two expansions are identical to all orders in @xmath48 and to leading order in @xmath136 .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 involves a matrix field ( two replica indices ) while @xmath201 has scalar field ( one replica index ) does not affect any of the multiplicity factors associated with any graph ; to leading order in @xmath136 , all relevant graphs were tree graphs before averging over the disorder in @xmath40 that corresponds to the @xmath52 vertex , and none of these graphs have numerical factors associated with summation over replica or vector indices .",
    "the equality of these perturbative expansions suggests , but does not establish , that the perturbatively inaccessible static fixed points of @xmath6 and @xmath201 may also be identical : if so , any scaling relations satisfied by @xmath201 should apply also to @xmath6 .",
    "the non - random yang - lee edge problem has a simple scaling structure  @xcite  there is a scaling relation between the exponents @xmath160 and @xmath205 as the order parameter @xmath183 is also the `` thermal operator '' .",
    "the simplest scaling hypothesis for the random case is that the identification of @xmath183 as the thermal operator continues to hold .",
    "this gives us the scaling relation @xmath206 numerical tests of this scaling relation in the randomly diluted ising model would be quite useful ( numerical studies of the full quantum spin glass problem are expected to be much more difficult ) .",
    "when combined with ( [ znu ] ) , ( [ nu ] ) leads to a scaling relation between @xmath129 , @xmath134 , and @xmath160 which is very similar ( or identical if @xmath207 ) to one considered recently by kirkpatrick and belitz  @xcite for the metal insulator transition .",
    "this paper has proposed a quantum field theory , defined by the action @xmath6 , for the low energy properties of metallic spin glasses in the vicinity of a @xmath3 transition between a metallic paramagnet and a metallic spin glass .",
    "the mean field phase diagram of the model as a function of a quantum coupling , temperature and applied magnetic field was described .",
    "the phase transitions and crossovers in this phase diagram were argued to be characteristic of a zero temperature , _ static _ critical theory containing no dynamic quantum fluctuations .",
    "quantum effects were shown to be dangerously irrelevant and controlled by a crossover exponent @xmath208 .    next",
    "an attempt was made to extend these results beyond mean field theory , but found runaway flows to strong coupling for all spatial dimensions below @xmath128 .",
    "nevertheless we used the insight gained from the mean field theory to propose a set of scaling hypotheses .",
    "we assumed that the true critical theory also contained only static , randomness induced fluctuations , and the exponent @xmath10 controlling quantum effects took an unknown positive value .",
    "this had some important observable consequences , similar to those found in the mean field theory : ( _ i _ ) the non - linear susceptibility had a weaker singularity at the critical point than might have been suggested by the usual scaling arguments .",
    "in particular , for a large enough @xmath10 a non - divergent cusp - like singularity was also possible .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) in a simple model of the renormalization group flow equations , finite @xmath2 dynamic response functions scaled as functions of @xmath209 , rather than the usual scaling as functions of @xmath210 . + ( _ iii _ ) exponents associated with various crossovers in the vicinity of the @xmath3 critical point were modified by @xmath10 .",
    "+ while these results were directly motivated by our analysis of metallic spin glasses , it is possible that some of the scaling ideas are more general and could apply also to insulating ising and rotor spin glasses and other @xmath3 transitions in random quantum systems .",
