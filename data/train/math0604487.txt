    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed , self - contained proof of the convergence of the critical site percolation exploration path ( on the triangular lattice ) to the trace of chordal @xmath0 for jordan domains .",
    "we will prove convergence in a strong sense : in the topology induced by the uniform metric on continuous curves ( modulo monotonic reparametrization ) , and  locally uniformly \" in the  shape \" of the domain and the starting and ending points of the curve .",
    "the main technical difficulty ( in the approach followed here ) appears in a rather surprising way  to obtain a markov property for any scaling limit of the percolation exploration path .",
    "the surprise is that an even stronger markov property trivially holds for the exploration path itself . to show that an analogous property holds in the scaling limit ( see theorem  [ spatial - markov ] and remark  [ explanation ] )",
    "is largely responsible for the length of the paper .",
    "roughly , the difficulty is that in the scaling limit the exploration path touches itself and the boundary of the domain ( infinitely many times ) .",
    "the touching of the domain boundary in particular requires a lengthy analysis ( see lemmas  [ double - crossing]-[mushroom ] ) since the standard percolation bound on multiple crossings of a  semi - annulus \" only applies to the case of a  flat \" boundary ( see  @xcite and appendix a of  @xcite ) .",
    "this issue is resolved here by using the continuity of cardy s formula with respect to changes in the domain .",
    "we remark that the results and methods developed here about touching of domain boundaries have other applications  e.g. , to the existence and conformal invariance of the full scaling limit in general ( non - flat ) domains ; these extensions of the results of  @xcite will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the proof has two parts : a characterization for @xmath0 curves ( theorem  [ characterization ] ) , which is similar to schramm s argument identifying @xmath1 but only uses conformal invariance of hulls at special stopping times , and a series of results showing that any subsequential scaling limit of the exploration path satisfies the hypotheses of theorem  [ characterization ] .",
    "the theorem of smirnov ( theorem  [ cardy - smirnov ] here ) about convergence to cardy s formula  @xcite is a key tool throughout .",
    "it is used in the proof of theorem  [ characterization ] , which follows roughly smirnov s sketch in  @xcite ( but with one significant difference  see remarks  [ remark - differ ] and  [ remark - difference ] ) , and is also crucial , in its strengthened version , theorem  [ strong - cardy ] , in proving that the  filling \" of the exploration path converges to a hull process having the markov property necessary to apply theorem  [ characterization ] .",
    "as mentioned , this step , implicitly assumed in smirnov s sketch  @xcite , turns out to be the most technically difficult one . despite its length ,",
    "we believe that a detailed proof is needed , since the result , beside its own interest , has important applications  notably the rigorous derivation of certain critical exponents  @xcite , of watt s",
    "crossing formula  @xcite and schramm s percolation formula  @xcite , and the derivation of the full scaling limit  @xcite . we note that smirnov has recently sketched in  @xcite a proof different from that of  @xcite .",
    "the percolation exploration path was introduced by schramm in 1999 in a seminal paper  @xcite where it was used to give a precise formulation ( beyond crossing probabilities ) to the conjecture that the scaling limit of two - dimensional critical percolation is conformally invariant .",
    "schramm s formulation of the conjecture involves his stochastic loewner evolution or schramm - loewner evolution ( @xmath1 ) , and can be expressed , roughly speaking , by saying that the percolation exploration path converges in distribution to @xmath0 .",
    "a simple and elegant argument , due again to schramm , shows that if the scaling limit of the percolation exploration path exists and is conformally invariant , then it must necessarily be an @xmath1 curve ; the value @xmath2 can be determined by looking at crossing probabilities , since @xmath0 is the only @xmath1 that satisfies cardy s formula  @xcite .",
    "shortly after schramm s paper appeared , smirnov published a proof  @xcite , for site percolation on the triangular lattice , of the conformal invariance of the scaling limit of crossing probabilities , opening the way to a complete proof of schramm s conjecture . in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) smirnov also outlined a possible strategy for using the conformal invariance of crossing probabilities to prove schramm s conjecture .",
    "roughly at the same time , convergence of the exploration path to @xmath0 was used by smirnov and werner  @xcite and by lawler , schramm and werner  @xcite as a key step in a derivation of the values of various percolation critical exponents , most of which had been previously predicted in the physics literature ( see the references in  @xcite ) .",
    "later , it was used by the authors of this paper to obtain the full scaling limit of two - dimensional critical percolation ( see  @xcite ) .    however , a detailed proof of the convergence of the exploration path to @xmath0 did not appear until 2005 , in an appendix of  @xcite , where we followed a modified version of smirnov s strategy .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present essentially that proof in a self - contained form .",
    "( we note that lemma a.3 in  @xcite , whose proof had an error , has been replaced by lemma  [ close - encounters ] here . )",
    "our proof roughly follows smirnov s outline of  @xcite , based on the convergence to cardy s formula  @xcite and on markov properties ( see theorem  [ characterization ] below and the discussion preceding it ) .",
    "but there are two significant modifications , which we found necessary for a proof .",
    "the first is to use a different sequence of stopping times , which results in a different geometry for the markov chain approximation to @xmath0 ( see remark  [ remark - difference ] ) .",
    "the second is that ",
    "close encounters \" by the exploration path to the domain boundary are not handled by general results for  three - arm \" events at the boundary of a half - plane , but rather by a more complex argument based partly on continuity of crossing probabilities with respect to domain boundaries ( see lemmas  [ double - crossing]-[mushroom ] ) .",
    "we note ( see remark  [ remark - differ ] below for more discussion ) that our choice of stopping times is closer in spirit than is the choice in  @xcite to the proofs of convergence of the loop erased random walk to @xmath3  @xcite and of the harmonic explorer to @xmath4  @xcite",
    ". it may also be applicable to other systems in which an @xmath1 limit is expected , provided that sufficient information can be obtained about conformal invariance of the scaling limit of the analogues of exploration hitting distributions in those systems .",
    "schramm s conjecture , as stated in smirnov s paper  @xcite , concerns the convergence in distribution of the percolation exploration path to the trace of chordal @xmath0 in a fairly arbitrary fixed domain . here",
    "( see theorem  [ conv - to - sle-1 ] ) we will prove a version of convergence which is slightly stronger but somewhat less general : we will show that the distribution of the percolation exploration path converges to that of the trace of chordal @xmath0  _ locally uniformly _ \" in the  shape \" of the domain and in the positions of the starting and ending points of the path , but we will restrict attention to jordan domains ( i.e. , domains whose boundary is a simple closed curve ) .",
    "our main motivation in this specific formulation is to provide the key tool needed in  @xcite to prove that the set of _ all _ critical percolation interfaces converges ( in distribution ) in the scaling limit to a certain countable collection of continuous , nonsimple , noncrossing , fractal loops in the plane .",
    "our formulation of convergence to @xmath0 is also sufficient for a key step in the proof of certain critical exponents  @xcite  namely for @xmath5 crossings of a semi - annulus and for @xmath6 crossings , not all of the same color , of an annulus . it does not appear to be sufficient , without at least also using some of  @xcite , for the derivation in  @xcite of the  one - arm \" exponent ( i.e. , for one crossing of an annulus ) and thus not sufficient for proofs of other exponents based on the one - arm exponent ( see  @xcite and sect .  1 of  @xcite ) .    in the next section ,",
