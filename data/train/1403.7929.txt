    "the advantage of charged particles , in particular , protons and carbon nuclei , used for radiation therapy of cancer consists in elevated dose delivered at the end of projectile range in tissues .",
    "the plateau of the depth - dose distribution at the entrance of a monoenergetic beam terminates with a sharp bragg peak which can be targeted at the tumor .",
    "such a dose profile helps to spare healthy tissues located in front of the tumor as well as beyond the projectile range . since a set of beam energies",
    "is typically used in treatments to cover the whole tumor volume , the resulting dose distribution is characterized by a spread - out bragg peak ( sobp )  @xcite with a wide domain of elevated dose .    the damage of healthy tissues during therapy can be essentially reduced if the ratio between the relative biological effectiveness ( rbe ) values at the sobp region and plateau is favorable . as recognized almost 40 years ago in radiobiological experiments with sobp beams of light nuclei performed at berkeley  @xcite , this rbe ratio is greater than 1 and increases with ion charge up to carbon .",
    "it was also found that this ratio decreases for ne and becomes less than 1 . in 1994",
    "first patient treatments with beams of carbon nuclei started in japan at national institute of radiological sciences ( nirs )  @xcite and in 1997 in germany at gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi )  @xcite .",
    "later the advantages of @xmath2c with respect to @xmath4he and @xmath5ne were confirmed in experiments at nirs with these nuclear beams  @xcite . as explained  @xcite , the rbe of @xmath2c beam with the linear energy transfer ( let ) of was found similar to the rbe of neutrons which have been used for treatment at nirs during last 20 years .",
    "this similarity also motivated the choice of carbon nuclei for treatments at nirs . in the last decades",
    "localized tumors have been successfully treated with beams of carbon nuclei at several facilities constructed in japan and germany  @xcite .    despite of the broad clinical experience",
    "collected worldwide with proton and carbon - ion beams , other light nuclei can be also considered as future therapy options .",
    "the radiobiological properties of proton and @xmath2c beams were compared in several studies , see e.g.  @xcite . however",
    ", less attention has been paid so far to @xmath0he or @xmath1o and to their comparison with protons and @xmath2c . there",
    "exist several clinical rationale behind the use of @xmath6he and @xmath1o for therapy :    * @xmath6he and @xmath1o beams have a reduced lateral spread of the dose distribution compared to protons ; * their rbe in the target volume is higher compared to protons ; * lower dose in the tail region and lower rbe in the plateau is expected for @xmath6he compared to @xmath2c due to reduced nuclear fragmentation of @xmath6he ; * @xmath1o is a promising option for hypoxic tumors as it provides a higher dose averaged let in the target volume compared to @xmath2c .",
    "the choice of ion species and their energies at each new particle therapy facility  @xcite essentially depends on let and rbe of the projectiles under consideration .",
    "the distributions of dose , let and dose averaged let of @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath7li , @xmath8be , @xmath9b , @xmath2c , @xmath10n and @xmath1o nuclei of therapeutic energies were studied  @xcite by means of monte carlo simulations with shield - hit and fluka codes , respectively .",
    "similar distributions for @xmath3h , @xmath4he , @xmath2c , @xmath5ne and @xmath11ni were calculated  @xcite with the geant4 toolkit to study their dependence on the ions mass , charge and energy .",
    "it was assumed  @xcite that ions with let above should be used for efficient cancer therapy as such species induce on average two and more double strand breaks in dna close to each other .",
    "however , as pointed out in the same work , this limit is not sharp and ought to vary with ion mass and charge .",
    "this indicates that the rbe of respective ions has to be additionally considered for an accurate comparison of their biological action .",
    "indeed , as shown in our recent work  @xcite , there is no direct correspondence between rbe and the frequency - mean linear energy @xmath12 , which represents let , for monoenergetic beams of therapeutic energies .",
    "similar rbe values were estimated  @xcite at the peak and plateau regions which are characterized , however , by very different @xmath12 .    as demonstrated  @xcite , microdosimetry spectra for monoenergetic @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath13li and @xmath2c nuclei propagating in a water phantom",
    "can be accurately described with our monte carlo model for heavy - ion therapy ( mchit )  @xcite , and this model coupled with the microdosimetric kinetic ( mk ) model  @xcite can be used to calculate the respective rbe profiles .",
    "in the present work we evaluate @xmath0he and @xmath1o for cancer therapy as complementary options to @xmath3h and @xmath2c by considering the biological dose distribution with a sobp delivered by these four projectiles .",
    "this is an important prerequisite for planning radiobiological experiments with @xmath0he and @xmath1o sobp beams and extending existing treatment planning systems to operation with @xmath0he and @xmath1o .",
    "the experimental data  @xcite collected at himac for the sobp obtained by the moderation of a @xmath2c beam are used as a reference .",
    "the results of microdosimetry simulations are validated by comparison with microdosimetry data collected for @xmath3h , @xmath0he and @xmath2c beams  @xcite .",
    "this makes possible to predict the rbe and cell survival profiles for @xmath1o beams and compare all four ion species in a common framework .",
    "with the monte carlo model for heavy ion therapy ( mchit )  @xcite the propagation of accelerated protons and light nuclei of therapeutic energies in tissue - like media can be simulated .",
    "the model is based on the geant4 toolkit  @xcite and takes into account all major physics processes relevant to the interactions of beam particles with these materials . the geant4 version 9.5 with patch 02 is used to build the present version of mchit , which also simulates the interactions of various particles with walled and wall - less tissue equivalent proportional counters ( tepc ) thus providing respective microdosimetry distributions .",
    "the ionization of atoms and multiple coulomb scattering on nuclei of the media are the most important electromagnetic processes to simulate the energy loss and straggling of primary and secondary charged particles .",
    "two predefined physics lists for electromagnetic processes are employed in mchit , namely , g4emstd ( which uses the `` standard electromagnetic physics option 3 '' ) and g4empen ( which uses the penelope models for low - energy processes ) .",
    "the low - energy thresholds for production of @xmath14-electrons are 990  ev for g4emstd and 100  ev for g4empen .",
    "however , in order to reduce the cpu time , cuts in range and energy thresholds for particle production are set differently for water , plastic of the tepc wall and the tepc sensitive volume filled with tissue - equivalent gas  @xcite .",
    "a customized physics list , g4empen+iongas , which is based on g4empen and the models describing the ionization of gas media by ions , can be also used in calculations . as demonstrated  @xcite , g4emstd and g4empen",
    "provide statistically equivalent results for microdosimetry spectra , which agree well with the distributions measured for @xmath6he  @xcite , excluding the domains of low linear energy , @xmath15 , and around the maximum at @xmath16 .",
    "however , the agreement between the data and calculations is improved when g4empen+iongas is used .",
    "therefore , g4empen+iongas is involved in mchit also in the present work to simulate electromagnetic processes inside the tepc volume .",
    "a therapeutic nuclear beam is attenuated in tissues due to the loss of beam nuclei in nuclear fragmentation reactions , which generate secondary projectile and target fragments  @xcite .",
    "nuclear reactions are taken into account in mchit to reproduce this effect .",
    "as shown  @xcite , the build - up of secondary fragments produced by and @xmath2c beams is generally well described with a customized physics list based on the light ion binary cascade model ( g4bic )  @xcite coupled with the fermi break - up model ( g4fermibreakup )  @xcite responsible for subsequent decays of excited nuclear fragments created at the first fast stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the present work g4bic",
    "is used for proton , helium and lithium beams , while the quantum molecular dynamics model ( g4qmd )  @xcite is involved in simulations with carbon and oxygen beams .",
    "more details on the physics processes and respective geant4 models involved in modeling with mchit are given in our recent publications  @xcite .",
    "the design and materials of specific tepc models were thoroughly introduced in mchit .",

    "the influence of the positioning of the tepc with respect to the beam axis and the distortion of the spectra due to the pile - up of individual events were investigated . after correcting for such effects",

    "finally , the biological dose @xmath36 is calculated from rbe@xmath32 and physical dose : @xmath37      the computing time required for treatment planing in carbon - ion therapy can be reduced by using pre - computed libraries of dose and rbe distributions for monoenergetic beams  @xcite .",

    "it is expected that a similar approach will be also suitable for other therapeutic beams , like @xmath0he and @xmath1o .",
    "therefore , we implemented a common algorithm to calculate the relative weights of pre - defined monoenergetic beams of @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o to obtain flat biological sobp distributions for each projectile as a product of the physical dose and rbe calculated for mixed radiation field .",
    "a library of depth - dose profiles and the corresponding microdosimetry spectra for different beam energies and nuclei were calculated by monte carlo simulations with mchit .",

    "in this work we presented our approach based on monte carlo simulations of microdosimetric spectra of monoenergetic beams of @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o in water .",
    "it provides @xmath18 values as input to the modified mk model  @xcite for calculating rbe@xmath45 for hsg cells for sobp distributions composed from monoenergetic beams of these projectiles .",
    "this method gives rbe@xmath45 for @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c which are in full agreement with rbe@xmath45 also calculated within the mk model , but from measured @xmath18  @xcite and rbe@xmath45 calculated from the parameters of lq fitting of survival curves of hsg cells  @xcite .",
    "this makes us confident in extending our approach to @xmath1o beams for which the respective data are not available .",
    "our approach provides well - adjusted biological dose distributions for @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o with a very flat sobp plateau .",
    "thus basic properties of mixed radiation fields in treatments with these projectiles are emulated .",
    "it is found that the shapes of rbe@xmath45 profiles for @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o are similar to each other , while the rbe@xmath45 for protons is almost constant ( @xmath61 ) over the whole depth in water , excluding enhanced rbe@xmath45 ( @xmath62 ) after the distal edge of the sobp plateau .",
    "considerably lower rbe@xmath45 values are estimated in the entrance and tail region for @xmath0he compared to @xmath2c and @xmath1o . in the target volume",
    "the highest rbe@xmath45 values of 1.52.5 are calculated for @xmath2c and @xmath1o .    in order to reduce side effects of ion therapy such as radionecrosis  @xcite the damage to surrounding healthy tissues",
    "should be reduced as much as possible . with the help of our mchit model connected with the modified mk model the severity of this damage",
    "is evaluated by calculating the cell survival fractions in healthy tissues for several kinds of therapeutic beams ( @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c , @xmath1o ) .",
    "we considered the cases of normal ( hsg cells ) , high and low radiosensitivity of tissues in the tumor volume and around it .",
    "the consideration of the impact of @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o sobp beams in these three cases led us to the following conclusions :    * in the case of early responding tissues all four charged particle beams induce severe damage not only to the target volume , but also around it . since in this case",
    "the region of high damage is not conformal to the target volume , the treatment with charged particles loses its advantages with respect to treatment with photons . * in the case of tissues with normal radiosensitivity ( hsg cells ) @xmath0he and @xmath2c beams spare tissue in the entrance channel better than @xmath3h and @xmath1o ones . *",
    "@xmath0he and @xmath2c nuclei are equally suitable for irradiation of tissues with normal and low radiosensitivity .",
    "the cell survival fractions calculated , respectively , for the entrance channel and target volume are similar for @xmath0he and @xmath2c .",
    "* however , as soon as it is important to spare healthy tissues after the distal edge of the sobp plateau , @xmath0h can be recommended due to the reduced nuclear fragmentation of these projectiles . *",
    "no definitive advantages of @xmath1o with respect to @xmath2c were found , with the except of an enhanced impact of these heavier projectiles on radioresistant tumors .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    "the authors studied the possibility to spare healthy tissues by properly selecting ion species for therapy .",
    "in addition to @xmath63h , @xmath6he , @xmath2c they considered lithium , beryllium , boron and neon ions and calculated the dose to normal tissue delivered by these beams . however , the option of @xmath1o was not considered , while the heidelberger ionenstrahl - therapiezentrum ( hit ) in heildeberg , germany , provides @xmath1o beams of therapeutic energies  @xcite in addition to @xmath63h , @xmath6he , @xmath2c .",
    "treatments at this facility are performed presently only with protons and carbon ions , but @xmath1o can be also used following respective pre - clinical studies . in this sense",
    "our study complements the results of remmes _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite by considering @xmath1o beams , and also by comparing cell survival profiles in @xmath3h , @xmath0he , @xmath2c and @xmath1o treatments in addition to biological dose profiles .",
    "as suggested  @xcite , multi modal irradiations with various nuclei can be used for let - painting . in this method",
    "high - let radiation is used to boost the let in a hypoxic sub - volume of the target ( hypoxic compartments of the tumor ) . at the same time",
    "low - let radiation is applied to the complementary target volume .",
    "such combination may increase tumor control and reduce side effects .",
    "this means that a thorough evaluation of the physical properties and biological effectiveness of different beams is necessary before they can be applied in real treatments .",
    "our approach can be also used for estimating rbe and cell survival fractions for @xmath13li , @xmath8be , @xmath9b and @xmath10n nuclei prior to planning radiobiological experiments with these beams .",
    "this work was partially supported by hic for fair within the hessian loewe - initiative .",
    "our calculations were performed at the center for scientific computing ( csc ) of the goethe university frankfurt .",
    "we are grateful to the csc staff for support ."
