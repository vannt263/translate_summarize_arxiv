    "supernovae are nature s grandest explosions .",
    "they are also responsible for synthesizing most of the elements of nature , including those that form our own planet , earth .",
    "many exotic states of matter , including black holes and neutron stars , also owe their existence to supernovae .",
    "since 1934 , when baade and zwicky [ 1 ] suggested that supernovae are energized by the collapse of an ordinary star to a neutron star , scientists started debating about the physical mechanism responsible for these spectacular explosions ( where the luminosity of the star becomes comparable to that of an entire galaxy containing around @xmath3 stars@xmath4 ) .",
    "whereas gravity remains the undisputed source of energy , the relative roles of other physical phenomena including , but not limited to , roles of neutrino , continue to be argued .",
    "the evolution of a massive star ( of masses above @xmath5 ) comprises of several stages including hydrogen , helium , carbon , neon , oxygen and silicon burning .",
    "the time scales , temperatures , densities , fuels , luminosities and neutrino losses for these stages can be found in ref . [ 2 ] . during the late phases of evolution of these massive stars an iron core develops ( of mass around @xmath6 ) .",
    "the binding energy per nucleon curve prohibits any further production of energy by nuclear fusion , yet the neutrino losses continue unabated , exceeding the sun s luminosity by a factor of about @xmath7 .",
    "capture rates and photodisintegration processes contribute in the lowering of the degeneracy pressure required to counter the enormous self - gravity force of the star . under such extreme thermodynamic conditions ,",
    "neutrinos are produced in abundance .",
    "eventually the collapse of the iron core begins .",
    "the mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is strongly believed to depend upon the transfer of energy from the inner core to the outer mantle of the iron core .",
    "neutrinos seem to be the mediators of this energy transfer . the shock wave , produced as a result , stalls due to photodisintegration and neutrino energy losses .",
    "once again the part played by neutrinos in this scenario is far from being completely understood .",
    "whereas haxton [ 3 ] proposed the mechanism of `` preheating '' by neutrinos as a means of assistance for shock revival , bruenn and haxton [ 4 ] later discouraged the preheating mechanism .",
    "they worked on two different models , simulating weak and strong shock cases , and found out that in neither case is the energy transferred to the matter by neutrino - nucleus absorption significant in terms of preheating the infalling iron - like material .",
    "more recently , langanke and collaborators [ 5 ] had some observations on the models of bruenn and haxton [ 4 ] and reported much larger preshock heating rates , albeit acting for too short a time to lead to consequences for shock propagation . according to authors in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering modifies the radiated neutrino spectra and strongly reduces the high - energy spectral tail of the electron neutrino burst at shock breakout .    a few milliseconds after the bounce , the proto - neutron star accretes mass at a few tenths of solar mass per second .",
    "this accretion , if continued even for one second , can change the ultimate fate of the collapsing core resulting into a black hole .",
    "neutrinos are the main characters in this play and radiate around 10@xmath8 of the rest mass converting the star to a neutron star ( e.g. [ 2 ] ) . despite the small neutrino - nucleus cross sections , the neutrinos flux generated by the cooling of a neutron star can produce a number of nuclear transmutations as it passes the onion - like structured envelope surrounding the neutron star . within @xmath9 0.1 s of the beginning of the collapse the nonthermal neutrino emission is dominated by electron neutrinos owing to the decay and capture of leptons by nuclei and free protons .",
    "the mean individual neutrino energies are some @xmath9 10 mev and constitute roughly 10@xmath8 of the total available energy of around @xmath10x @xmath11 erg [ 6 ] .",
    "the neutrino energy loss rates are important input parameters in multi - dimensional simulations of the contracting proto - neutron star .",
    "the reenergizing by charged - current electron neutrino and antineutrino absorption on the dissociation - liberated protons and neutrons in the postshock flow remains integral to the supernova paradigm and neutrino transport is arguably the single most important component of any supernova model [ 7 ] .",
    "( for a review of supernova neutrino microphysics see also ref . [ 8 ] . )",
    "parameter - free multi - dimensional models , with neutrino transport included consistently throughout the entire mass , yield conflicting results on the key issue of whether the star actually explodes .",
    "reliable and microscopic calculations of neutrino loss rates and capture rates can contribute effectively in the final outcome of these simulations on world s fastest supercomputers .    during core infall electron neutrinos",
    "are produced almost entirely by electron captures on free protons and nuclei and at sufficiently high temperatures antineutrinos are also produced as a result of positron captures on neutrons .",
    "electron capture on protons and positron capture on neutrons also play a crucial role in the evolution of star and supernova explosion . during the collapse and accretion phases",
    ", they decrease the degenerate pressure in the stellar core .",
    "the neutrinos produced in these capture processes carry the energy away and result in the lowering of the entropy of the core .",
    "positron captures are of great importance in high temperature and low density locations . in such conditions ,",
    "a rather high concentration of positrons can be reached from @xmath12 equilibrium favoring the @xmath13 pairs .",
    "positron capture on elements lying at the bottom of the valley of nuclear beta - stability ( so - called _ s _ elements ) may capture positrons and be transformed into a proton - rich isobars ( so - called _ p _ elements ) . the electron capture on proton and the positron capture on neutron",
    "are considered important ingredients in the modelling of type - ii supernovae [ 9 ] .",
    "fuller , fowler , and newman ( ffn ) [ 10 ] performed the first - ever extensive calculation of stellar weak rates including the capture rates , neutrino energy loss rates and decay rates for a wide density and temperature domain .",
    "they made this detailed calculations for 226 nuclei in the mass range @xmath14 .",
    "they also stressed the importance of the gamow - teller ( gt ) giant resonance strength in the capture of the electron and estimated the gt centroids using zeroth - order ( @xmath15 ) shell model .",
    "later , aufderheide et al .",
    "[ 11 ] extended the ffn work for heavier nuclei with a @xmath16 60 .",
    "they tabulated the 90 top electron capture nuclei averaged throughout the stellar trajectory for @xmath17 ( see table .",
    "25 therein ) .",
    "since then theoretical efforts were concentrated on the microscopic calculations of capture rates of iron - regime nuclide .",
    "large - scale shell model ( e.g. [ 12 ] ) and the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation theory ( pn - qrpa ) ( e.g. [ 13 ] ) were used extensively and with relative success for the microscopic calculation of stellar capture rates and neutrino energy losses .",
    "monte carlo shell - model is an alternative to the diagonalization method and allows calculation of nuclear properties as thermal averages ( e.g. [ 14 ] ) .",
    "however it does not allow for detailed nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "nabi and klapdor [ 15 ] calculated weak interaction rates for 709 nuclei with a = 18 to 100 in stellar matter using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "these included capture rates , decay rates , neutrino energy loss rates , probabilities of beta - delayed particle emissions and energy rate of these particle emissions . since",
    "then these calculations were further refined with use of more efficient algorithms , incorporation of latest data from mass compilations and experimental values , and fine - tuning of model parameters [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] .",
    "@xmath1co is abundant in the presupernova conditions and is thought to contribute effectively in the dynamics of presupernova evolution .",
    "aufderheide and collaborators [ 11 ] placed @xmath1co among the list of top ten most important capture nuclei during the presupernova evolution .",
    "later heger et al .",
    "[ 20 ] also identified @xmath1co as the most important nuclide for capture purposes for massive stars ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "realizing the importance of @xmath1co in astrophysical environments , nabi , rahman and sajjad [ 21 ] reported the calculation of electron and positron capture rates on @xmath1co using the pn - qrpa theory ( see also ref . [ 22 ] ) .",
    "however there was a need to perform a fine calculation of these important capture rates on a detailed temperature - density grid suitable for collapse simulation codes ( see , for example , ref .",
    "[ 18 , 23 ] ) . due to",
    "the extreme conditions prevailing in these scenarios , interpolation of calculated rates within large intervals of temperature - density points posed some uncertainty in the values of capture rates for collapse simulators .",
    "further , as mentioned above , the neutrino energy loss rates needed to be included in these expanded calculations on a detailed stellar temperature - density grid to make them more useful in simulation codes .    in this paper we present for the first time an expanded calculation of ( anti)neutrino energy loss rates and positron capture rates on @xmath1co at fine intervals of temperature - density intervals .",
    "section ii deals with the formalism of our calculation . due to existing physical situation and lack of experimental data the uncertainties present in stellar rate calculations",
    "are considerable .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties of the pn - qrpa model in section iii .",
    "in section iv we will be presenting some of our results .",
    "comparisons with earlier calculations are also included in this section .",
    "we finally will be concluding in section v and at the end table v presents our expanded calculation of ( anti)neutrino energy loss rates and positron capture rates on @xmath1co .",
    "the qrpa theory is an efficient way to generate gt strength distributions .",
    "these strength distributions constitute a primary and non - trivial contribution to the calculation of positron capture and neutrino energy loss rates .",
    "kar et al .",
    "[ 24 ] pointed out that the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) method is quite successful in predicting the weak interaction rates of ground states all over the periodic table and also stressed the need to extend these methods to non - zero temperature domains relevant to presupernova and supernova conditions .",
    "qrpa is also the method of choice in dealing heavy nuclei [ 25 ] .",
    "the qrpa theory considers the residual correlations among the nucleons via one particle one hole ( 1p-1h ) excitations in a large model space .",
    "nabi and klapdor [ 15 ] extended the qrpa model to configurations more complex than 1p-1h .",
    "we used the pn - qrpa theory to calculate the gt strength functions and the associated capture and neutrino energy loss rates for @xmath1co .",
    "the reliability of the pn - qrpa calculations was discussed in detail by nabi and klapdor [ 13 ] . there",
    "the authors compared the measured data ( half lives and b(gt ) strength ) of thousands of nuclide with the pn - qrpa calculations and got fairly good comparison .",
    "we incorporated experimental data wherever available to further strengthen the reliability of our calculated rates .",
    "the calculated excitation energies ( along with their log ft values ) were replaced with the experimental ones when they were within 0.5 mev of each other .",
    "missing measured states were inserted and inverse and mirror transitions were also taken into account .",
    "we did not replace the theoretical levels with the experimental ones beyond the excitation energy for which experimental compilations had no definite spin and/or parity assignment ( 2.98 mev in case of @xmath1co ) .",
    "the pn - qrpa theory was used with a separable interaction which granted us the liberty of performing the calculations in a much larger single - particle basis than a general interaction .",
    "we performed the pn - qrpa calculations using a model space of seven major harmonic oscillator shells ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for our calculations was of the form @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath22 is the pairing force , @xmath23 is the particle - hole ( ph ) gamow - teller force , and @xmath24 is the particle - particle ( pp ) gamow - teller force .",
    "single particle energies and wave functions were calculated in the nilsson model , which takes into account nuclear deformations .",
    "pairing was treated in the bcs approximation .",
    "the proton - neutron residual interactions occurred as particle - hole and particle - particle interaction .",
    "the interactions were given separable form and were characterized by two interaction constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the selections of these two constants were done in an optimal fashion .",

    ", we took the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "other parameters required for the calculation of weak rates are the nilsson potential parameters , the deformation , the pairing gaps , and the q - value of the reaction .",
    "nilsson - potential parameters were taken from ref . [ 28 ] and the nilsson oscillator constant was chosen as @xmath29 ( the same for protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the calculated half - lives depend only weakly on the values of the pairing gaps [ 29 ] .",
    "thus , the traditional choice of @xmath30 was applied in the present work .",

    "however these experimental data are not enough to completely explore the domain of nuclei which are interesting from astrophysical viewpoint .",
    "there is no experimental data concerning gt strength distribution from parent excited states . in the stellar environment , at high temperatures and densities",
    ", there is a finite probability of occupation of parent excited states and transitions from these excited states are sometimes many orders of magnitude higher than transitions from ground states [ 19 ] .",
    "the weak interaction rates are calculated using @xmath65 here @xmath66 represents the parent excited states and @xmath67 the daughter s .",
    "the first factor is a constant and the second are phase space integrals which can be calculated relatively accurate .",
    "it is the third factor ( the reduced transition probabilities ) which contains interesting nuclear physics and incorporates uncertainties in the model . again",
    "the reduced transition probabilities is a sum of fermi and gt component ( see eqt .",
    "2 ) . whereas the calculation of fermi transition is rather straightforward it is precisely the calculation of the excited states and reduced transition probabilities of the gt transitions which is the main cause of uncertainty of the underlying model . the pn - qrpa model constructs parent and daughter excited states and also calculates gt strength distribution among these states in a microscopic fashion . in other words",
    "the brink s hypothesis is not employed in this calculation which increases the reliability of the pn - qrpa calculations ( brink s hypothesis states that gt strength distribution on excited states is identical to that from ground state , shifted only by the excitation energy of the state ) .",
    "as mentioned above there are still uncertainties present due to the parameters of the model .",
    "roughly , the parameters of the pn - qrpa model can be divided into two different groups : ( i ) `` internal '' parameters of the model which are by some means adjustable ( the pairing gaps and the gt strength parameters ) and ( ii ) `` external '' parameters for which input from other sources like mass formulae ( or experimental data , if available ) is necessary ( these include single particle energies and wavefunctions , deformations , q values and neutron / proton separation energies ) . whereas `` internal '' parameters are of minor importance the uncertainty in the `` external '' parameters",
    "must be viewed as the limiting factor for the calculation of weak interaction rates of unstable nuclide .",
    "the values taken for these parameters and their optimal selection procedure were highlighted in the previous section . in order to further increase the reliability of the calculated rates",
    "experimental data were incorporated into the model as also discussed in the previous section .",
    "we , however , do have a reasonable amount of experimental data on measured half - lives and as such the pn - qrpa theory was tested to check the accuracy of the model against the experimentally known half - lives using the _ same set _ of parameters .",
    "the check was performed in both `` beta minus decay '' and `` electron capture '' directions .    in tables ( i ) and ( ii ) , @xmath68 denotes the number of experimentally known half - lives shorter than the limit in the second column , @xmath69 is the number ( and percentage ) of isotopes reproduced under the condition given in the first column , and @xmath70 is the average deviation defined by @xmath71 where + @xmath72 if @xmath73 +   + @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "+   + ( @xmath76 is the calculated half - life using the pn - qrpa model and @xmath77 is the corresponding measured half - life . ) for example , the pn - qrpa reproduces 93@xmath8 of all experimentally known half - lives",
    "shorter than 1 minute for @xmath78/ec within a factor of 10 with an average deviation of @xmath70 = 1.718 and 95@xmath8 of all known @xmath79-decaying nuclei with half - lives less than a minute are reproduced within a factor of 5 with an average deviation of @xmath70 = 1.56 .",
    "it can be seen from the tables that the model works better with increasing neutron excess ( corresponding to shorter half - lives ) , that is , with increasing distance from stability .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation , since forbidden transitions is neglected in the calculation .",
    "this is also a promising feature with respect to the prediction of unknown half - lives ( specially for unstable isotopes ) , implying that the predictions are made on the basis of a realistic physical model ( see also table  i and table  j of ref .",
    "[ 13 ] for predictive power of pn - qrpa in `` electron capture '' direction , and table  k of ref .",
    "[ 13 ] for the predictive power of the model in the `` beta minus decay '' direction ) .",
    "at temperatures pertinent to supernova environment we have a finite probability of occupation of excited states and a microscopic calculation of rates from these excited states is desirable .",
    "earlier , nabi and sajjad [ 19 ] did point to the fact that the brink s hypothesis ( and back resonances for calculation of beta decay rates ) is not a good approximation to use in stellar rate calculations .",
    "brink s hypothesis states that gt strength distribution on excited states is identical to that from ground state , shifted only by the excitation energy of the state whereas the gt back resonances are states reached by the strong gt transitions in the electron capture process built on ground and excited states .",
    "the luxury of having a huge model space at our disposal allowed us to perform the calculation of electron capture rates from 30 excited states of @xmath1co .",

    "recently , we presented the extensive calculation of electron capture rates on @xmath1co on a fine temperature - density scale where we also discussed our results in detail [ 23 ] . here",
    "we would like to present a similar calculation for the positron capture and the associated ( anti)neutrino energy loss rates due to weak - interaction mediated reactions in the core of massive stars .    fig.1 shows four panels depicting our calculated positron capture rates at selected temperature and density domain .",

    "t@xmath88 gives the stellar temperature in units of @xmath89k .",
    "one should note the order of magnitude differences in positron capture rates as the stellar temperature increases .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that in the low density region the positron capture rates , as a function of stellar temperatures , are more or less superimposed on one another .",
    "this means that there is no appreciable change in the rates when increasing the density by an order of magnitude .",
    "we also observe that the positron capture rates are almost the same for the densities in the range @xmath90 .",

    "the rates increase monotonically with increasing temperatures .",
    "fig.2 and fig.3 depict our calculated neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath1co .",
    "it is pertinent to mention again that the neutrino energy loss rates ( depicted in fig.2 ) contain contributions due to electron capture _ and _ positron decay on @xmath1co whereas the antineutrino energy loss rates ( fig.3 ) are calculated due to contributions from positron capture _ and _ electron decay on @xmath1co .",
    "the energy loss rates are given in logarithmic scales ( in units of @xmath91 ) .",

    "as far as comparison with the pioneering work of ffn is concerned , we note that again our rates are enhanced at presupernova temperature - density domain",
    ". however at large stellar temperatures and densities , ffn neutrino energy loss rates surpass our rates .",
    "there are two main reasons for this enhancement of ffn rates .",
    "firstly , ffn placed the centroid of the gt strength at too low excitation energies in their compilation of weak rates for odd - a and odd - odd nuclei [ 35 ] .",
    "secondly , ffn threshold parent excitation energies were not constrained and extended well beyond the particle decay channel . at high temperatures contributions from these high excitation energies",
    "begin to show their cumulative effect .",
    "simulators should take note of our enhanced neutrino energy loss rates at the lower temperatures and densities characteristic of the hydrostatic phases of stellar evolution which may affect the temperature and the corresponding lepton - to baryon ratio which becomes very important going into stellar collapse .",
    "the story is different for the comparison of antineutrino energy loss rates ( fig.5 ) .",
    "this time we note that the large - scale shell model rates and ffn rates are much more enhanced compared to pn - qrpa rate calculations .",
    "nevertheless these are very small numbers and can change by orders of magnitude by a mere change of 0.5 mev , or less , in parent or daughter excitation energies and are more indicative of the uncertainties present in the calculation of the excitation energies .",
    "fig.6 shows our summed gt@xmath53 strength as a function of excited states in the daughter @xmath1ni .",
    "we note that almost all the strength cumulates up to an energy around 12 mev in @xmath1ni .",
