    "the gate dielectric plays a crucial role for the functionality of thin film field - effect transistors .",
    "it is responsible for the reliability of the device , governs the required driving voltages and also limits the polarizations which can be achieved at the interface . in organic thin film transistors",
    "the most common dielectric is sio@xmath4 .",
    "it is well known and characterized from its use in the conventional semiconductor industry , and has the advantages of excellent insulation with low leakage currents and chemical stability .",
    "the required silicon wavers with an oxide dielectric layer are commercially available and the source and drain electrodes can be easily fabricated by lithography or by deposition through a shadow mask .",
    "various groups have in this way prepared transistors with different organic layers such as pentacene or copper - phthalocyanine @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to concentrate on the growth of the active organic layers , but limits the experiments to the regime of low charge carrier concentrations .",
    "many organic materials show electronic interactions which are strongly influenced by the charge carrier concentration .",
    "examples are charge transfer salts based on organic molecules such as tetrathiofulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ( ttf)-(tcnq ) @xcite or k@xmath5tcnq@xmath6 @xcite which show the behavior of a peierls or mott insulator @xcite",
    ". large changes in the charge carrier concentration may even induce a mott metal - insulator transition , allowing for a so called mott transition field - effect transistor ( mtfet ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to grow these materials in transistor structures where high polarizations can be reached .",
    "but also for other organic semiconductors , where no mott metal - insulator transition occurs , the utilization of high kappa dielectrics is interesting , because the high polarizations result in transistors with low driving voltages .",
    "+ the charge carrier concentration at the insulator surface which can be induced in field - effect experiments is the product of breakdown field and dielectric constant evaluated at the breakdown field @xcite .",
    "it therefore depends on the intrinsic properties of the material .",
    "with sio@xmath4 as dielectric a breakdown field of @xmath7 and polarizations of up to are possible at best , while with complex oxide dielectrics with a perovskite structure polarizations in the range from can be achieved under carefully optimized conditions @xcite .",
    "from the perovskite class srtio@xmath0is one of the best characterized materials . it has a cubic crystal structure with a lattice constant of @xmath8 and the advantage of a high dielectric constant of @xmath9 for bulk material at room temperature .",
    "thin films of srtio@xmath0have been grown with various techniques , such as rf sputtering @xcite , pulsed laser deposition @xcite or molecular beam epitaxy @xcite .",
    "the dielectric constant and breakdown voltage in thin film samples is in general lower than in bulk samples most likely due to defects and inhomogeneities of the electric field caused by surface roughness @xcite .",
    "furthermore , srtio@xmath0can be doped with niobium , which results in a conductive crystalline substrate material , ideally suited for the growth of an epitaxial dielectric srtio@xmath0layer @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , to demonstrate the capability of srtio@xmath0as high-@xmath10 dielectric for organic thin film field - effect transistors , the well known organic _",
    "p_-type semiconductor copper phthalocyanine was chosen as the active layer .",
    "cupc ( cun@xmath11c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) is a crystalline synthetic blue pigment from the group of phthalocyanine dyes .",
    "it has been used by various groups in field - effect experiments , usually with sio@xmath4 as the dielectric when deposited as thin films , but also already with high - permittivity insulators @xcite .",
    "an ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) system was employed for the preparation of the devices .",
    "it consisted of distinct chambers used for the individual process steps .",
    "the growth of the dielectric layer , active layer and the contact preparation was studied separately before they were combined to fabricate field effect transistors completely in - situ .      for the growth of",
    "the srtio@xmath0layers rf - sputtering was used .",
    "the growth of sputtered srtio@xmath0was characterized with x - ray diffraction employing cu - k@xmath15 radiation in parallel beam mode and optical microscopy and optimized with respect to high crystallinity , a smooth surface and a sufficient growth rate .",
    "the sputtering target had a diameter of two inches and was at a distance of about from the substrate .",
    "for the final fet structure preparation srtio@xmath0layers had to be grown on nb - dopend srtio@xmath0(100 ) substrates . since by x - ray diffraction thin film and substrate related bragg reflexions can in this case hardly be discriminated , the dielectric layer growth was optimized on mgo ( 100 ) substrates .",
    "the thus obtained sputtering parameters were then used for fet preparation on nb - doped srtio@xmath0(100 ) employing an argon / oxygen mixture of 2:1 at a chamber pressure of , a substrate temperature of and a forward sputter power of .",
    "the films were post annealed inside the chamber at for 1 hour in an oxygen atmosphere of .",
    "the deposition time was 90 minutes for field - effect transistor preparation which resulted in a nominal thickness of about . during the optimization on mgo",
    "the srtio@xmath0films grew preferentially in the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "the bragg peaks of the sputtered films were shifted to lower 2@xmath16 values as compared to bulk srtio@xmath0 .",
    "this was probably related to the larger lattice constant of mgo ( @xmath17 ) as compared to srtio@xmath0(@xmath18 ) which caused a tensile stress due to the misfit @xcite .",
    "post annealing further improved the crystalline quality of the srtio@xmath0films .",
    "this was demonstrated ex - situ in an oven at for , so that the sample properties could be compared before and after annealing .",

    "cupc growth was studied at different substrate temperatures on @xmath19-al@xmath4o@xmath0(100 ) and srtio@xmath0(100 ) . no difference in growth behavior between these different substrates could be observed .",
    "in contrast to this the substrate temperature had a strong impact on the growth , as observed by x - ray diffraction .",
    "the temperature influence was studied in the range from room temperature to .",
    "the films changed with increasing substrate temperature from smooth , with small angle oscillations and only a small bragg peak to higher crystallinity , with a larger bragg peak and a rougher surface with few or no small angle oscillations .",

    "the bragg peak is in agreement with the ( 200 ) plane of the @xmath19-phase of cupc .",
    "the @xmath19-phase is frequently reported for vacuum deposition of cupc at moderate substrate temperatures @xcite , while the @xmath21-phase can be found at high substrate temperatures or deposition rates @xcite . in the @xmath19-phase",
    "the molecules are oriented close to edge - on with respect to the substrate . for the field - effect transistors prepared in this study an intermediate substrate temperature of",
    "was chosen .",
    "this temperature was selected to balance the somewhat conflicting requirements of high crystallinity and layer smoothness .",
    "+ field - effect transistors in thin film geometry with cupc as active layer and srtio@xmath0as dielectric were prepared in - situ on ( 100 ) nb doped srtio@xmath0substrates in bottom gate geometry .",
    "the source and drain electrodes were made of a gold layer by evaporation through shadow masks .",
    "transistors were prepared in bottom contact ( contact preparation before active layer ) and top contact ( contact preparation after active layer ) geometry as sketched in fig .",

    "the values obtained for @xmath10 from the transistors with srtio@xmath0as the dielectric layer were typically around 180 to 200 and the dielectric could usually withstand voltages of about which corresponds to a breakdown voltage of about and a polarization of . to calculate mobilities from the fet characteristics",
    "the capacitance per unit area was required , which was calculated from the measured capacitance and the area of the electrodes to about .",
    "+ all cupc transistors showed _",
    "p_-type semiconducting behavior . for all transistors",
    "only low voltages were necessary to achieve a pronounced modulation of the source drain current .",
    "the response characteristics of the transistors were measured multiple times with increasing voltages .",
    "the voltages were ramped up and down slowly and often a hysteresis was observed .",
    "the top contact transistors showed a better performance ( i.e.  higher mobility ) , possibly due to an annealing effect of the active layer during contact preparation , i.  e.  au evaporation through a shadow mask .",

    "[ fig : currentvolatagesto ] .",
    "the transfer curves were measured for different fixed source drain voltages .",
    "the gate voltage was ramped up and down and also a hysteretic behavior was observed .",
    "a hysteresis behavior in organic fets is not uncommon and usually related to trapped charges @xcite .",
    "+ for positive gate voltages the conductivity was suppressed and the drain current decreased below the zero gate voltage current , which can be interpreted as a depletion behavior .",
    "saturation was hardly obtained for drain currents exceeding the gate voltage .",
    "this indicates a negative build in zero ( threshold ) voltage which biased the transistor .",

    "the mobility is obtained from the transfer curve by @xcite @xmath29 or from the slope of a plot , where the slopes of the response curves in the linear regime at constant gate voltage are plotted over gate voltage by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the drain and @xmath32 is the threshold voltage . the mobility obtained in the linear regime",
    "was derived from transfer curves to @xmath33 .",
    "additionally , the mobility was determined from the slopes of the response curves for small drain voltages . a plot of the derived slopes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fet11-mobility - linear2 ] .    from a fit to theses values a mobility of @xmath2 and a threshold voltage of @xmath34 was calculated .",

    "[ fig : fet11-mobility - sat ] .",
    "the currents at @xmath35 were obtained from the response curves from fig .",
    "[ fig : currentvolatagesto ] . the square roots of these currents were then plotted over the gate voltage and from the slope the mobility was calculated to @xmath36 and the threshold voltage to @xmath37 .",
    "the plot showed the typical increase in slope towards higher gate voltages @xcite .",
    "in summary , fets with srtio@xmath0as dielectric and cupc as semiconductor were prepared in - situ .",
    "the values derived for mobility in the linear and the saturation regime were in grood agreement and amounted to @xmath2 . these mobilities were obtained without optimization of the cupc layer with respect to transport properties . in the literature",
