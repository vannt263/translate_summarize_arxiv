    "conformal field theory with boundaries , a subject developed largely by john cardy,@xcite has found applications to various quantum impurity problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "a particular branch of this subject involves boundary condition changing operators .",
    "they were used to obtain a new understanding of a class of problems in condensed matter physics where a local change in a hamiltonian is made suddenly , for example by x - ray absorption in a metal .",
    "this article is mainly a review of work on this subject by andreas ludwig and the author@xcite with a few new insights presented . in the next section we review boundary condition changing operators in conformal field theory . in section iii",
    "we discuss their application to the x - ray edge singularity and anderson s orthogonality catastrophe , giving some new results . in the final section we discuss x - ray edge singularities in the kondo problem .",
    "some of the new results were obtained in collaboration with alex zagoskin.@xcite",
    "consider conformal field theory on the half - plane,@xcite @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the requirement that the boundary of the half - plane , the real axis , remain fixed reduces the full group of conformal transformations , @xmath2 , to those obeying @xmath3 , an infinite subgroup",
    ". we will be interested in general conformally invariant boundary conditions on the strip which are consistent with @xmath4 where @xmath5 , ( @xmath6 ) , is the holomorphic ( anti - holomorphic ) part of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this corresponds to vanishing momentum density at the boundary , corresponding to conservation of quantum mechanical probability density . for a given bulk conformal field theory ,",
    "the set of conformally invariant boundary conditions , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , ... can be determined .    in general the scaling dimensions of boundary operators",
    "can be related to the finite size scaling of energy levels on a strip , as shown in figure ( [ fig : contran ] ) . under the conformal transformation",
    "@xmath9 the correlation function of the primary boundary condition changing boundary operator @xmath10 transforms as : @xmath11^{2x } } = \\sum_n|<aa;0|o|ab;n>|^2e^{-[e^{ab}_n - e_0^{aa}]\\delta u}. \\label{main}\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath12 , we see that : @xmath13^{2x}}\\to   \\left({\\pi \\over l}\\right)^{2x } e^{-\\pi x\\delta u\\over l}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath10 changes the boundary condition from @xmath7 to @xmath8 on the lower boundary .",
    "since the finite size energies , @xmath14 , depend on the boundary conditions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it follows that the dimensions of boundary operators depend on the boundary conditions : @xmath15,\\label{energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 labels the lowest energy state with a non - zero matrix element in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "depending on the operator , @xmath10 , @xmath16 may equal @xmath17 , corresponding to the groundstate with boundary conditions @xmath18 , or possibly on excited state .",
    "we also see from eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) that this matrix element scales with system size as : @xmath19    = 10 cm",
    "consider the electron energy levels in a metal .",
    "[ see figure ( [ fig : core ] ) . ]",
    "= 5 cm    in addition to the partially filled conduction band there are also core levels in which the electron is tightly bound to a particular nucleus .",
    "x - ray absorption can either eject a core electron ( photoemission ) or raise it to the conduction band , as indicated in figure ( [ fig : core ] ) .",
    "the resulting core hole produces a local electrostatic potential acting on the conduction electrons which affects the x - ray absorption probability producing a singularity at the threshold , as indicated in figure ( [ fig : thresh ] ) .",
    "a very simple model was discussed by nozires and de dominicis.@xcite @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the dispersion relation of the conduction band electrons , annihilated by @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 annihilates the core electron .",
    "@xmath24 is the local potential .",
    "( electron spin is ignored . )",
    "an essential observation@xcite is that : @xmath25=0.\\ ] ] the hilbert space consists of two sectors . in one @xmath26 ; the core level is filled and there is no potential . in the other @xmath27 ; the core level is empty and consequently the potential @xmath24 is exerted on the conduction electrons . in the simpler case of x - ray photoemission , the absorption intensity is : @xmath28inserting the @xmath23 operator switches on the potential , @xmath24 , at time 0 .",
    "it is later switched off at time @xmath29 . at low energies , turning on @xmath24",
    "is equivalent to changing the boundary conditions .",
    "thus @xmath23 is a boundary condition changing operator .",
    "= 5 cm    we will assume that both @xmath21 and @xmath30 are spherically symmetric and consider only s - wave scattering .",
    "( it is straightforward to generalize the method to other cases . )",
    "linearizing the dispersion relation around the fermi surface , we obtain a low energy theory consisting of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional dirac fermions defined on the half - line @xmath31 , with the potential @xmath24 at the origin .",
    "see figure ( [ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "we integrate out all degrees of freedom except for electrons with energies very close to the fermi energy , @xmath32 .",
    "thus the fields obey an effective boundary condition at the origin : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the s - wave phase shift at the fermi energy .",
    "= 10 cm    the state @xmath35 has the core hole present but the conduction electrons filling the v=0 fermi sea . in the infinite volume limit , this state is orthogonal to the groundstate with the core hole present , in which the electrons in the fermi sea are rearranged by the potential .",
    "this is known as the `` anderson orthogonality catastrophe '' .",
    "it is this rearrangement of the fermi sea , produced by v , which leads to the x - ray edge singularity .    on a finite strip ( corresponding to s - wave electrons inside a finite sphere ) : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the unperturbed filled fermi sea and @xmath38 is the state with the core electron absent and the filled fermi sea perturbed by the presence of the core hole potential , v. from the conformal transformation of eq .",

    "it is instructive to calculate the complete expression for this energy difference , without making any low energy approximations , in order to ensure that the @xmath39 term indeed only depends on the phase shift at the fermi surface , @xmath34 , that is on the boundary condition in the low energy effective theory . for large @xmath42 , @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the fermi wave - vector and the phase - shifted wave vector , @xmath45 , is defined by the _ self - consistent _ equation : @xmath46 taylor expanding out to terms of @xmath47 , @xmath48\\nonumber \\\\ & = & -{1\\over \\pi}\\int_0^{e_f}d\\epsilon \\delta ( \\epsilon ) + v_f{\\pi \\over l}{1\\over 2}\\left[{\\delta ( e_f)\\over \\pi } \\right]^2.\\label{xdelta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 is the fermi velocity and we have integrated by parts to obtain the last line , using the fact that @xmath50 which follows from analyticity of the dispersion relation .",
    "the first term in @xmath51 is o(1 ) and depends on the phase shift thoughout the conduction band .",
    "this formula is known as fumi s theorem . on the other hand , the second term , of @xmath47 , only depends on the phase shift right at the fermi surface .",
    "thus this term ( although not the first one ) is given correctly by the low energy theory which only keeps states near the fermi surface .",
    "it is determined by the boundary condition of eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) . taking into account that we have set @xmath52 in our previous equations",
    ", we see that the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator , @xmath23 is given by : @xmath53 ^ 2.\\label{x}\\ ] ]    now suppose that the potential v is attractive and produces a boundstate . in this case , the x - ray absorption intensity has 2 thresholds : a lower energy one corresponding to intermediate states in which the boundstate is occupied and a higher energy one corresponding to intermediate states in which it is empty.@xcite [ see figure ( [ fig : bs ] ) . ]",
    "these are separated by the binding energy of the boundstate , @xmath54 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the boundstate wavefunction and energy decay exponentially and hence do nt contribute to the @xmath47 terms in the energies .",
    "hence the exponent at the first threshold is given by precisely the previous formulas , eqs .",
    "( [ gx ] , [ x ] ) . to obtain the exponent at the second threshold , where the boundstate is empty , we just need to calculate the @xmath39 term in the energy .",
    "the calculation is precisely the same as before except that now there is one extra electron in the continuum , since it is not in the boundstate .",
    "the corresponding boundary condition changing operator in this case has no matrix element to the groundstate , @xmath38 so the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) comes from the excited state with one extra electron at the fermi surface .",
    "the next available state at the fermi surface has wave - vector @xmath55 , so : @xmath56 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\delta e + e_f+v_f{\\pi \\over l}\\left({1\\over 2}-{\\delta ( e_f)\\over \\pi}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & = & -{1\\over \\pi}\\int_0^{e_f}d\\epsilon \\delta ( \\epsilon ) + e_f+v_f{\\pi \\over l}{1\\over 2}\\left[{\\delta ( e_f)\\over \\pi}-1 \\right]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the scaling dimensions for the filled and empty boundstate thresholds , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are : @xmath59 ^ 2,\\ \\",
    "x_e={1\\over 2}\\left[{\\delta ( e_f)\\over \\pi } -1\\right]^2.\\ ] ]    = 10 cm    these results for the x - ray exponent were all obtained earlier by nozires and de dominicis@xcite and combescot and nozires@xcite . an early calculation using bosonization",
    "was given by schotte and schotte.@xcite the result for the orthogonality exponent ( ignoring boundstates ) was obtained by anderson.@xcite nonetheless , the present approach , based on conformal transformation and calculation of the energy difference , has several advantages .",
    "once the relationship to the energy difference is obtained , pages of complicated calculations reduce to a few lines . in particular , using previous approaches , it is only straightforward to obtain the relationship between exponents and phase shift in the born approximation , where the phaseshift is proportional to the ( weak ) potential , @xmath24 .",
    "the simple derivation given above [ eq .",
    "( [ xdelta ] ) ] establishes , via the connection with groundstate energies , that it is indeed precisely the phaseshift at the fermi surface , @xmath34 , which determines the exponents , even when the potential is not weak .",
    "furthermore , our new approach easily permits numerous generalizations to less trivial problems .",
    "for example , it can be used to calculate x - ray and orthogonality exponents in an interacting one - dimensional electron gas ( luttinger liquid)@xcite .",
    "as long as the bulk interactions leave the electrons gapless , the low energy theory is a conformal field theory ( free massless boson ) .",
    "while backscattering from the core hole potential leads to highly non - trivial renormalization , in the end the low - energy physics is governed by a simple conformally invariant boundary condition , for which the value of the scaling dimension , @xmath40 , can be determined from the finite - size energies , eq .",
    "( [ energy]).@xcite recent density matrix renormalization group work@xcite confirms the prediction for the exponent , @xmath40 , from both the finite - size energy and the matrix element , in eq .",
    "( [ gx ] ) . on the other hand , a direct numerical simulation of the green s function in eq .",
    "( [ gx ] ) is a much more formidable task .",
    "we review another non - trivial application of this approach in the next section .",
    "now we endow both conduction electrons and core electrons with a spin index , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . as well as potential scattering there could also be a spin - spin interaction between core and conduction electons : @xmath63 ( a sum over spin indices is implied . ) as before , @xmath64=0 $ ] . when the core hole is present , it acts like an s=1/2 impurity spin : @xmath65 when it is absent the core level is spinless .",
    "thus the x - ray absorption turns on a kondo interaction , @xmath66 .",
    "this problem appears considerably more difficult than the potential scattering case , discussed in the previous section , because the kondo hamiltonian contains non - trivial physics even without sudden switching .",
    "assuming j is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath67 ) , it renormalizes to large values in the infrared .",
    "however , it has been shown that the infrared stable fixed point corresponds to a conformally invariant boundary condition.@xcite from this solution of the kondo problem we can determine x - ray edge and orthogonality exponents .",
    "the conformally invariant boundary condition giving the infrared fixed point can be specified in terms of the finite size spectrum.@xcite we begin with free boundary conditions on both sides of a finite strip .",
    "this leads to a trivial spectrum .",
    "it is convenient to express this in terms of a ( trivial ) conformal embedding .",
    "beginning with two dirac fermions ( one for each spin ) we bosonize and introduce charge and spin bosons .",
    "the finite size spectrum can be expressed in terms of @xmath68 kac - moody conformal towers with highest weight states of spin @xmath69 .",
    "the reason for two su(2 ) s is that the underlying theory of 2 free dirac fermions is equivalent to 4 free majorana fermions and hence has so(4 ) symmetry . expressed in terms of @xmath68 characters , the spectrum is : @xmath70 where the first and second factor come from the spin and charge sector respectively .",
    "the infrared kondo fixed point corresponds to fusion with the @xmath71 primary field in the spin sector .",
    "this fusion process is a conformal field theory representation of screening of the ( s=1/2 ) impurity by the conduction electrons .",
    "the resulting spectrum is : @xmath72 the energies of highest weight states , or scaling dimensions of primary operators , for spin @xmath73 and @xmath74 kac - moody algebra are given by:@xcite @xmath75 the core hole operator , @xmath76 , takes the groundstate into the state with spin 1/2 and charge 0 .",
    "( only the charge of conduction electrons is relevant . )",
    "it has scaling dimension @xmath77    so far we have only considered photoemission in which the core electron is ejected from the metal .",
    "now we consider the case where instead the core electron is excited into the conduction band .",
    "ignoring the eventual decay back into the core level ( which occurs incoherently ) the x - ray aborption intensity in this case is given by : @xmath78 in principle ( not worrying about possible selection rules in the x - ray absorption process ) , the core hole and extra conduction band electron can be in a singlet or triplet state .",
    "different exponents are obtained for these two cases .",
    "we must calculate the dimension of the boundary condition changing operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these change the groundstate into a state with kondo boundary conditions and quantum numbers @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath81 , @xmath83 respectively .",
    "( we only count the charge of the conduction electrons . ) the exponent , @xmath40 , is obtained from the lowest energy state with the right quantum numbers in the @xmath84 partition function .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath83 corresponds to a primary field , of dimension @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ dimkj ] ) , since @xmath81 corresponds to the @xmath71 primary of a second @xmath68 km algebra associated with charge . on the other hand ,",
    "their is no primary with j=1 for @xmath68 .",
    "this state is a descendent in the @xmath81 , @xmath83 product of conformal towers , with dimension : @xmath86 ( it is a mac - moody descendent but a virasoro primary , so eq . ( [ main ] ) still applies . )",
    "the corresponding x - ray edge exponents are obtained from the usual formula , @xmath87 .",
    "this calculation can be generalized to the k - channel kondo problem in which the conduction electrons carry an additional flavour index , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the kondo interaction with the core spin ( which does nt carry a flavour index ) is as in eq .",
    "( [ h_k ] ) with a diagonal sum over the flavour of the conduction electrons .",
    "the infrared fixed point for the multichannel kondo problem has also been indentified as a conformally invariant boundary condition.@xcite a key step in this identification is a conformal embedding of 2k dirac fermions .",
    "one first uses non - abelian bosonization to represent the 2k fermions by a charge boson and a @xmath90 wess - zumino - witten model.@xcite then one uses the conformal embedding : @xmath91 which was worked out by altshler , bauer and itzkson.@xcite [ the @xmath92 theory is actually equivalent@xcite to @xmath93 , but we wo nt use this result here . ] the finite size spectrum with kondo - free boundary conditions is again obtained by fusion with the j=1/2 conformal tower in the @xmath74 theory .",
    "the photoemission exponent is given by the dimension of @xmath76 , with j=1/2 , q=0 . from eq .",
    "( [ dimkj ] ) this is : @xmath94 the operators giving the x - ray exponents for the case where the core electron goes into the conduction band , @xmath95 and @xmath96 have j=1 or 0 respectively , q=0 and transform under the fundamental representation of @xmath97 . from the fusion transformation on the free fermion spectrum ,",
    "expressed using the conformal embedding , it can be checked that the corresponding primaries occur in the @xmath84 spectrum .",
