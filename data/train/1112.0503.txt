    "one basic assumption for interpretation of the bao measurements is that the matter distribution is isotropic at the relevant scales ( @xmath1 ) . in this work we use alignment correlation functions @xcite to show that the amplitudes of the two - point correlation function measured along the orientations of the high density peaks are larger than those derived from spherically averaged ( conventional ) clustering analysis out to scales of @xmath5 and discuss possible effects on measurements of the bao .",

    "we employ the alignment correlation functions , more exactly , the average of the alignment correlation function within given angular ranges , to quantify the large - scale alignment between the matter distribution in the universe and the orientation of high density peaks ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "distances are computed in redshift space using the distant observer approximation . in this case the differences in the amplitudes between the conventional and the alignment correlation functions are somewhat reduced but still significant beyond the bao scale .    in conclusion ,",
    "the alignment correlation function between dark matter density peaks with masses @xmath35 and the overall matter distribution reveals anisotropies at scales larger than @xmath36 far beyond the bao scale .",
    "the difference between conventional correlation functions and correlation functions measured along and perpendicular to the orientations of the peaks is most pronounced for the most massive peaks in real - space at @xmath37 .",
    "but it remains visible at earlier time and also if projected orientations are used .",
    "the findings presented here are based on n - body simulations however qualitative similar effects are expected to shape the observed galaxy correlation functions at scales up to @xmath36 .",
    "potential observational implications are : + @xmath38 _ large - scale anisotropy and structure of two point correlation functions : _ our results indicate that matter is distributed anisotropically out to separations far larger then the bao scale . at any given pair separation",
    "the conventional correlation function is the average of the alignment correlation function over the whole range of @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the alignment correlation function measured along high density peaks does not fall below zero ( for separations @xmath39 ) which is counterbalanced by negative amplitudes at much smaller separations for measurements perpendicular to it . at the bao scale galaxy",
    "two point correlation functions can be interpreted as the average of a more highly clustered component along the direction of high density peaks and a less clustered component perpendicular to it .",
    "+ @xmath38 _ shape and location of the bao peak : _ at bao scales the amplitudes of the correlation functions between high density peaks and the overall matter distribution are significantly higher if measured along the orientation of the peaks . in this case",
    "the bao peak is composed of a hump on top of the declining but still positive correlation function . the signal perpendicular to the orientations is dominated by the bao hump itself with negligible underlying clustering signal .",
    "the location of the bao peak is found at somewhat smaller ( larger ) scales if measured parallel ( perpendicular ) to the orientation of high density peaks .",
    "for the measurements along the density peak orientations the bao hump is transformed into a plateau - like feature .",
    "if the survey volume is dominated by large filamentary structures the shape of the conventional correlation function should be close to that found for the parallel signal shown here .",
    "this may relate to a study by @xcite who find no apparent peak in 6% of their mock samples .",

    "we find similar results for the correlation functions measured along the orientations of high density peaks .",

    "the wigglez redshift - space correlation function at @xmath34 @xcite shows a crossover as well .",

    "* ) it should in principle be possible to directly measure the large scale anisotropies with alignment correlation functions if cluster orientations can be determined with sufficient accuracy . an anisotropy signal",
    "may even be extracted simply by using orientations of the cluster central luminous red galaxies because the orientations of central galaxies and host systems are correlated @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath38 _ improvement of bao measurements : _ if the directional effects reported here are observable it would be worthwhile considering to measure the bao peak perpendicular to the orientations of galaxy clusters ( or luminous red galaxies ) since in this direction the bao peak is better confined .",
