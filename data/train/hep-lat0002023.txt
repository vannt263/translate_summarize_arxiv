    "<S> in the domain - wall formulation of chiral fermion , the finite separation between domain - walls ( @xmath0 ) induces an effective quark mass ( @xmath1 ) which complicates the chiral limit . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study the size of the effective mass as the function of @xmath0 and the domain - wall height @xmath2 by calculating the smallest eigenvalue of the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator in the topologically - nontrivial background fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , just like in the free case , @xmath1 decreases exponentially in @xmath0 with a rate depending on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum fluctuations amplify the wall effects significantly . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical result is consistent with a previous study of the effective mass from the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .    </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry and its explicit and/or spontaneous breakings are important aspects of strong interaction phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> chiral dynamics dominates the low - energy hadron structure and interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral phase transition at finite temperature has been sought after experimentally for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the weak interaction probes couple directly to the chiral currents , and the matrix elements of which sensitively depend on the chiral properties of hadron systems . on the theoretical frontier , however , massless fermions defy the naive nonperturbative treatments . indeed , for more than two decades , finding an appropriate fermion formulation has been one of the most difficult challenges in lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the last few years , kaplan and shamir s domain - wall construction @xcite and narayanan and neuberger s overlap fermion formalism @xcite have emerged as promising approaches to simulating massless quarks . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we aim to study the effectiveness of the domain - wall approach which has already been used in a number of realistic numerical investigations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> following previous studies , we adopt shamir s version of the domain wall fermion formulation @xcite , in which the five dimensional wilson fermion is first introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the finite fifth dimension with @xmath0 lattice sites extends from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> dirichlet boundary condition on the quark fields is applied to the four - dimensional slices at @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth component of the gauge potential is identically zero and the other four components are the same at every @xmath7 slice . </S>",
    "<S> the above construction in the gauge - field - free case yields nearly - massless modes when the negative wilson mass @xmath2 ( the wall height ) is taken between 0 and 10 . </S>",
    "<S> these chiral fermions appear as the surface modes at @xmath3 and @xmath4 with opposite chirality . for @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> one flavor dirac fermion can be constructed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the chiral projection operators and @xmath11 labels four - dimensional lattice sites . for the finite wall separation ( @xmath12 ) , the chiral mode on the @xmath3 wall couples with the one with the opposite chirality on the @xmath4 wall in an exponentially small way . </S>",
    "<S> because of this coupling , a finite residual fermion mass is produced . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to understand the size and dependence of this induced fermion mass on @xmath2 , @xmath0 when realistic background gauge fields are introduced .    in the absence of the gauge potentials , </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass can be defined in terms of the pole of the free green s function . for a large @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , it has a simple analytical form @xcite , @xmath13 one can also obtain @xmath1 by either diagonalizing the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator @xmath14 or @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the domain - wall dirac operator and @xmath17 is the reflection along the fifth dimension . on a lattice with the periodic boundary condition , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest four - momentum of a fermion is zero , and the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath18 is just @xmath1 . to study the effective mass in an external gauge field , we have constructed a code to diagonalize @xmath19 numerically . to test the code , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed @xmath1 on an @xmath20 lattice with @xmath21 and 16 , and the result is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] together with the exact answer from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal massless fermion is obtained at @xmath22 where @xmath1 vanishes identically . for @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> the induced quark mass decays exponentially in @xmath0 with a rate depending strongly on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential decay slows down significantly as @xmath2 approaches 0 and 2 . for any given accuracy @xmath24 and any @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a window surrounding @xmath22 in which @xmath25 .    in the presence of a realistic gauge potential , </S>",
    "<S> the effective quark mass result from the finite wall separation may depend on how it is defined . </S>",
    "<S> different definitions shall yield results consistent up to a factor of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> one approach is to exploit the explicit quark mass dependence in chiral ward identities such as the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation as done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effective mass in an alternative way . in continuum field theory , the atiyah - singer theorem@xcite states that the dirac operator has a zero eigenvalue in the presence of an external background with topological charge @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of the solution was found by t hooft in 1976 @xcite . on the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , however , the notion of topological charge is ill defined : any gauge configuration can be continuously deformed into a null gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the discretization of an instanton field can introduce finite lattice - spacing effects lifting any exact zero eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a test of the atiyah - singer theorem on lattice is usually complicated with various lattice artifacts </S>",
    "<S> .    there exists , however , a definition of lattice topology and fermion zero mode which largely avoids this complication . in the overlap formalism , the dirac operator is constructed from the overlap of two many - fermion ground states @xcite . according to their recipe , one starts from a four - dimensional wilson - dirac operator with a negative wilson mass @xmath2 and calculates its eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath2 small and positive , the number of positive eigenvalues is equal to that of negative ones . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 increases , a level might cross from positive to negative or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> when this happens , the gauge field is regarded to have a net topological charge @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> then the overlap determinant is exactly zero by construction . </S>",
    "<S> this definition of lattice topology and zero mode do depend on , for instance , the wilson parameters @xmath27 and @xmath2 . however , the zero eigenvalue is exact , independent of the lattice spacing @xmath28 and volume @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the domain - wall formulation can be regarded as an approximation to the overlap formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the limit of @xmath30 , one recovers the overlap formalism apart from some unimportant discretization effect in the fifth dimension . for a fixed gauge configuration and wilson mass @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> if the overlap determinant is zero , @xmath19 has an exact zero mode in the limit of @xmath30 .    in short , in a background gauge field , if the hermitian wilson - dirac operator has a level crossing , the gauge field is considered to have a nontrivial topology . </S>",
    "<S> edwards , heller , and narayanan have done extensive studies of the topological properties of lattice gauge configurations in this way @xcite . in a topologically - nontrivial background </S>",
    "<S> thus defined , the domain - wall dirac operator with a finite @xmath0 has small eigenvalues , nonvanishing only because of the finite wall separation . in the remainder of this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we are mainly interested in such domain - wall effects on the fermion zero - mode . </S>",
    "<S> we _ define _ the smallest eigenvalues of the hermitian domain - wall operator @xmath19 as the wall - induced effective fermion mass .    as a first nontrivial example </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2a ] and [ fig:2b ] the results in a smooth instanton field configuration on an @xmath20 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a similar study has been reported in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the instanton configuration was generated according to the prescription in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : the size of the instanton @xmath31 is 10 and the cutoff parameter @xmath32 is 3 . the flow of the small eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2a ] . </S>",
    "<S> a level crossing from positive to negative is seen at @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> four separate crossings in the opposite direction happen near @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> only three of the crossings are plotted . in the overlap formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the dirac operator has an exact zero eigenvalue in the region between the crossings .    </S>",
    "<S> the lowest eigenvalue of the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator @xmath35 is shown in logarithmic scale in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2b ] . </S>",
    "<S> the overall profile of the eigenvalue as a function of @xmath2 is similar to the free case in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . for a fixed @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the smallest eigenvalue occurs at around @xmath36 , shifted upward from @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this shift reflects the renormalization of the wilson mass in the presence of the external gluon field . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath2 deviates from @xmath38 , the domain - wall effects grow stronger . for a fixed @xmath2 , the effective fermion mass decreases exponentially as @xmath0 increases from 8 to 12 and 12 to 16 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ hbt ]    [ hbt ]    [ hbt ]    our result is quantitatively consistent with the chiral condensate @xmath39 calculation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect then @xmath39 grows like @xmath43 as the explicit quark mass parameter @xmath44 reduces to @xmath45 . for a fixed @xmath46 and @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a window in @xmath47 $ ] in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2b ] where the induced quark mass @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we expect @xmath39 is approximately independent of @xmath2 there . at @xmath48 , </S>",
    "<S> the effective quark mass is about @xmath49 with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the chiral condensate to have little sensitivity on @xmath44 when @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> all of the above are in accordance with those reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    a smooth instanton on the lattice is far from a typical equilibrium gauge configuration entering in the feynman path integral . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic study of the induced quark masses requires gauge configurations with quantum fluctuations fully included . in the following , we work on a set of monte carlo configurations generated on a four - dimensional @xmath20 lattice and with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical volume is somewhat small , but we suspect that the domain - wall effects have a weak dependence on it .    </S>",
    "<S> we pick a lattice configuration in which the lowest eigenvalue of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator crosses from the positive to the negative at @xmath2 near 0.9 . in fig.[fig:3a ] , we have shown the flow of the lowest few eigenvalues as a function of @xmath2 . between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , four levels cross from the negative to positive region . </S>",
    "<S> although not shown explicitly , six level crossings occur at around @xmath55 . as pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the hermitian wilson - dirac operator is symmetric with respect to @xmath55 and hence the flow diagram has the same symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> according to the overlap fermion formalism , the neuberger - dirac operator in the above gauge background has one zero eigenvalue when @xmath2 is in the interval @xmath56 $ ] , three zero eigenvalues in @xmath57 $ ] , three again in @xmath58 $ ] , and finally one in @xmath59 $ ] .    in fig.[fig:3b ] , we have shown the smallest eigenvalue of the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> different symbols correspond to three different @xmath60 ( pluses ) , @xmath61 ( circles ) , and @xmath62 ( squares ) . over a large region of @xmath2 , the effective quark mass decreases exponentially in @xmath0 , as is clear from the approximate equal spacings between pluses , circles , and squares . </S>",
    "<S> the fastest decay occurs at @xmath2 around @xmath63 , compared with 1.0 in the free case and 1.3 in the smooth instanton field . </S>",
    "<S> the wall effects become strong again near @xmath64 beyond which we find four small eigenvalues ( not shown ) . to our surprise , this transition point to the doubler region is at higher @xmath2 compared with the prediction from the spectral flow of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate some subtle differences between the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix in the domain - wall formalism and those of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator in the overlap formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> the important point about fig.[fig:3b ] is that the magnitude of the effective mass is much enhanced relative to the case of the smooth instanton configuration . with a best choice of @xmath2 near 2.0 </S>",
    "<S> , the domain - wall dirac operator has the smallest eigenvalue @xmath65 at @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for the same @xmath0 and with @xmath2 of 1.3 , the smooth instanton configuration yields an eigenvalue @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this dramatic increase of the effective mass comes from the ultraviolet fluctuations . as we will discuss further below , </S>",
    "<S> the ultraviolet fluctuations at strong coupling can cause great trouble for the domain - wall formalism . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3c ] , we have shown the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath19 in another topological gauge configuration . the result is qualitatively similar to that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3b ] . in particular , for @xmath66 and @xmath68 , </S>",
    "<S> the induced quark mass is around @xmath69 .    since the effective quark mass depends on particular gauge fields , it is useful to get an average over an ensemble of gauge configurations . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we have generated a set of 150 configurations on a @xmath20 lattice at @xmath70 . by studying the spectral flow of the hermitian wilson - dirac operators </S>",
    "<S> , we found 12 topologically - nontrivial configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the second column in table i shows @xmath2 at which the first level crossing occurs . </S>",
    "<S> all the crossing points are entirely concentrated in the interval between 0.8 and 1 , a fact consistent with a similar study in a slightly larger lattice @xmath71 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to calculate the lowest eigenvalue of the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator with @xmath21 and @xmath62 at @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown as the remaining columns in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the average effective quark mass at @xmath66 is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the average effective mass in @xmath0 is consistent with the exponential within the error .    </S>",
    "<S> our result can be compared with a previous study of the wall - induced quark mass using the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation on a @xmath74 lattice at the same value of @xmath75 @xcite . in the domain - wall formulation </S>",
    "<S> , the quenched chiral condensate is related to the pion susceptibility @xmath76 @xcite by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant vanishing in the @xmath30 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the effective quark mass @xmath1 can be extracted from @xmath44-dependence of the condensate and @xmath76 . for @xmath66 and @xmath72 , an extrapolation to @xmath79 limit yields @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the smallest @xmath44 at which the data is taken is @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the physical significance of @xmath82 , we recall the spectral version of the gmor relation in the overlap formulation @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are a conjugating pair of eigenvalues of @xmath85(@xmath86 = overlap dirac operator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first term signifies the contribution from the topological zero modes ; for sufficiently large volume v and/or large @xmath44 , this topological charge term is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the second term measures the chiral symmetry breaking effects on the conjugating pairs of eigenvalues . in the study quoted above @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the topological charge term is insignificant even at the smallest @xmath87 , and the extracted @xmath88 undoubtly measures the explicit chiral - symmetry breaking effects in conjugating pairs of eigenvalues as induced by the domain walls .    </S>",
    "<S> one can push the quenched calculation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the limit @xmath79 . in this case , both the chiral condensate @xmath39 and pion susceptibility are dominated by the zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> the quark mass obtained from the ratio of the two observables is just the smallest eigenvalue of the dirac operator in the topologically - nontrivial configurations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in the quenched chiral limit , the effective quark mass determined from the gmor relation coincides with what we have considered in this paper . to be sure </S>",
    "<S> , the effective mass defined from the effects on the fermion zero modes is not the same as the one defined from the effects on the conjugating pairs of eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , both definitions shall be consistent within a factor of order unity . in this spirit , </S>",
    "<S> our average effective quark mass @xmath89 is indeed in accordance with @xmath90 from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to be completely sure about the consistency of the two approaches , </S>",
    "<S> further numerical studies are needed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , along the line of study in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one can attempt to subtract the zero - mode contribution to the chiral condensate and pion susceptibility , and then both quantities can be measured in the @xmath91 limit . on the other hand , the present study can be repeated at a larger physical volume ; a @xmath74 lattice will be more suitable for comparison .    . </S>",
    "<S> average effective mass for the topologically nontrivial configurations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we finally return to the central question of the domain - wall fermion formalism : how large an @xmath0 is needed for a practical simulation ? </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the results for the free field or artificially smooth gauge fields are of no help here . </S>",
    "<S> the answer depends on the size of quantum fluctuations . for large values of @xmath75 ( and perhaps small physical volumes as well ) , such as the case </S>",
    "<S> we have presented , one can work with @xmath92 or 16 and keep the induced quark mass under control . </S>",
    "<S> however , in going to smaller @xmath75 and larger physical volume , level crossing happens continuously in a region of @xmath2 above some critical value @xcite . from figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3b ] and [ fig:3c ] , we expect that if a level crossing occurs slightly before the @xmath2 where the domain - wall dirac operator is defined , the wall - induced quark mass will be huge . </S>",
    "<S> [ when the level crossing happens slightly above @xmath2 , the chiral symmetry breaking effects in the conjugation pairs of eigenvalues is expected to be strong . </S>",
    "<S> again this leads to a large effective quark mass . ] </S>",
    "<S> then the average effective quark mass can be strongly influenced by this type of accidental configurations depending on the frequency they occur . </S>",
    "<S> the level crossings at large @xmath2 reflect strong quantum fluctuations at the scale of the lattice spacing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is not surprising that at @xmath93 , one needs to have very large @xmath0 ( 30 to 40 ) to keep @xmath1 small ; of course , this is the price that one has to pay to keep the physical volume large .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the induced quark mass resulted from the finite domain wall separation by diagonalizing the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator in topologically nontrivial configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we find the quantum fluctuation strongly enhances the domain - wall effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effective mass does show an exponential decay as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our result on an @xmath20 lattice with @xmath52 is consistent with the effective fermion masses from the gmor relation , although a detailed analysis shows that the two definitions of the effective mass are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we comment on the size of @xmath0 needed in a practical monte carlo simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank n. christ , r. edwards , and j. negele for useful discussions related to the subject of this paper . </S>",
