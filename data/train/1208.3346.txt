    "the np - complete problem partition @xcite is the question of deciding whether or not a given set of integers @xmath1 can be broken into two sets , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that the sums of the two sets are equal , or that @xmath4 . since it is widely believed that @xmath5 , it is interesting to study various types of _ refutations _ , or certificates for the _ non_-existence of a partition in a given set @xmath0 .    in this paper , we study the certificates provided by hilbert s nullstellensatz ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given an algebraically - closed field @xmath6 and a set of polynomials @xmath7 $ ] , hilbert s nullstellensatz states that the system of polynomial equations @xmath8 has _ no _ solution if and only if there exist polynomials @xmath9 $ ] such that @xmath10 we measure the complexity of a given certificate in terms of the size of the @xmath11 coefficients , since these are the unknowns we must discover in order to demonstrate the _ non_-existence of a solution to @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we measure the degree of a nullstellensatz certificate as @xmath12 .",
    "there is a well - known connection between hilbert s nullstellensatz and a particular sequence of linear algebra computations .",
    "these sequences have been studied from both a theoretical perspective @xcite , and a computational perspective @xcite .",
    "when the polynomial ideal contains @xmath13 for each variable ( thus forcing the variety to contain only 0/1 points ) , these sequences have also been explored as algebraic proof systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , d. grigoriev demonstrates a linear lower bound for the knapsack problem in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and buss and pitassi @xcite show that a polynomial system loosely based upon the  pigeon - hole principle \" requires a @xmath14 nullstellensatz degree certificate .",
    "however , when the system of polynomial equations @xmath15 models an np - complete problem , the degree @xmath16 is likely to grow at least linearly with the size of the underlying np - complete instance @xcite .",
    "in other words , as long as @xmath17 , the certificates should be hard to find ( i.e. , the size of the linear systems involved should be exponential in the size of the underlying instance ) , and as long as @xmath5 , the certificates should be hard to verify ( i.e. , the certificates should contain an exponential number of monomials ) .",
    "for example , consider the np - complete problem of finding an independent set of size @xmath18 in a graph @xmath19 . recall that an independent set is a set of pairwise non - adjacent vertices .",
    "this problem was modeled by lovsz @xcite as a system of polynomial equations as follows :        clearly , this system of polynomial equations has a solution if and only the underlying graph @xmath19 has an independent of size @xmath18 .",
    "for example , consider the turn graph @xmath22 . by inspection",
    ", we see that size of the largest independent set in @xmath22 is two .",
    "therefore , there is _ no _ independent set of size three , and using the connection between hilbert s nullstellensatz and linear algebra ( described more thoroughly in sec [ sec_pm ] ) , the authors of @xcite produce the following certificate :        the combinatorial interpretation of this algebraic identity is unexpectedly clear : the size of the largest independent set is the degree of the nullstellensatz certificate ( i.e. , the largest monomial @xmath24 corresponds to the maximum independent set formed by vertices @xmath25 ) , and the coefficient @xmath26 contains one monomial for each independent set in @xmath19 .",
    "the combinatorial interpretation of these certificates is proven in @xcite by de loera et al . only in terms of monomials : the relationship between the numbers such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the independent sets of the underlying graph is not clear .    in this paper , we model the partition problem as a system of polynomial equations , and then present a combinatorial interpretation of an associated minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificate .",
    "however , the focus of our combinatorial interpretation is not only on the relationship between partitions and monomials , but also on the relationship between partitions and numeric coefficients ( i.e. , the numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) . in section [ sec_part_model ] , we present an algebraic model of the partition problem and describe a minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificate . in section [ sec_pm ] , we describe the connection between hilbert s nullstellensatz and linear algebra , leading to the construction of a _ square _ system of linear equations , forming what we call the _ partition matrix_. in section [ sec_det ] , we prove our main result : the determinant of the partition matrix represents a brute - force iteration over _ all _ the possible partitions of the set @xmath0 , a polynomial we refer to as the _ partition polynomial_.            the partition problem determines if a given set of integers @xmath31 can be divided into two sets , @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that @xmath4 . in this section , we describe a system of polynomial equations that models this question , and discuss the degree and monomials in an associated minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificate .",
