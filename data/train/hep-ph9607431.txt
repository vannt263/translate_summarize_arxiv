    "we explore to what extent their structure , their decays and their electromagnetic couplings can be understood on the basis of an effective lagrangian which approximates the flavor su(3 ) sector of qcd , with u-,d- and s - quarks , at low energy .",
    "vector mesons are well known to play a key role in the electromagnetic interaction of hadrons .",
    "they represent the lowest `` dipole '' ( spin - parity @xmath8 ) excitations of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , first developed in the late sixties @xcite , proved remarkably successful in the description of a variety of hadron electromagnetic form factors and decays .",
    "now that quantitative explorations of hadron structure using electromagnetic probes are reaching a new stage , an update of vmd seems timely and appropriate .",
    "this is also needed to guide investigations of possible changes of vector meson properties in dense nuclear matter .",
    "the modern view is to combine vmd and chiral dynamics , two principles governing low energy qcd , in a suitably constructed effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "our main purpose here is to demonstrate that this works indeed and provides a reliable framework for further studies .    in the following chapters we develop the effective lagrangian and discuss important constraints from gauge invariance .",
    "we then examine a variety of applications in confrontation with experiment : the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors , p - wave @xmath9 scattering in the isospin @xmath10=1 channel , specific processes such as @xmath11 and the dalitz decay @xmath12 , and aspects of @xmath5- and @xmath6-mixing .",
    "special emphasis will be given to the @xmath13-dependence of virtual photon - hadron couplings , with @xmath13 the squared photon four - momentum .",
    "such questions are relevant in the analysis of dilepton production , a process actively discussed as a source of information about hadron properties in compressed and excited matter .",

    "this current can be rewritten identically as @xmath18 where we have introduced combinations which directly reflect the quark compositions of the corresponding vector mesons : @xmath19 in the following we identify always @xmath20 with the neutral @xmath0-meson and drop the index .",
    "the decay of a given vector meson @xmath21 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 into an @xmath22 pair is described by the matrix element @xmath23 connecting a vector meson with the qcd vacuum .",
    "such matrix elements are commonly written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the vector meson masses and @xmath26 is a polarization vector .",
    "the vector meson couplings @xmath27 are determined by their @xmath28 decay widths ( neglecting the electron mass ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 . from the empirical widths",
    "one finds : @xmath31 note that these values are not far from the expected su(3 ) ratios , @xmath32 in the original formulation by sakurai and others @xcite the vmd hypothesis was written in terms of a current - field identity , @xmath33 which directly relates the hadronic electromagnetic current , at the operator level , to the neutral vector meson fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for later purposes it is important to recall that equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) strictly holds only at the vector meson poles , i.e. at timelike photon four momentum with @xmath37 , although it has often been used over wider ranges of @xmath13 without further notice .",

    "our description of the kaon form factor is not yet complete .",
    "contributions from the @xmath20 and @xmath1 mesons must also be included .",
    "we use su(3 ) relations to determine their couplings to @xmath287pairs : @xmath288 .",
    "the improved kaon form factor is then : @xmath289 the @xmath20 meson self - energy now incorporates both @xmath127 and @xmath290 loop contributions , and the @xmath20-photon coupling .",
    "( we mention in passing that corrections to the pion formfactor from @xmath291 loops are small and can safely be neglected there ) .",
    "the primary correction in the present context comes from the photon coupling to a @xmath121 loop which converts into @xmath291 via the intermediate @xmath20 meson . for an intermediate @xmath1-meson ,",
    "this mechanism does not exist as a leading effect .",
    "we can therefore ignore the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath292 and simply use @xmath293 .",
    "the bare masses are @xmath294 as before ( the mass shift due to the @xmath295 coupling is almost negligible ) and @xmath296 .",
    "the predicted charged kaon form factor for timelike @xmath13 is shown in fig.10 .",
    "it exhibits the @xmath2 meson as the dominant structure .",
    "fig.11 shows the form factor at spacelike @xmath297 . here",
    "it becomes evident that the @xmath2 alone is not enough to reproduce the slope of the formfactor at small @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath1 meson contributions to @xmath262 are an important part of the mean square radius of the charged kaon , @xmath298 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & 0.40\\ ; { { \\rm fm}}^2\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it agrees quite well with the empirical value @xcite @xmath299 given that the @xmath300 and @xmath301 coupling constants can only be estimated through su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the neutral kaon form factor is obtained from eq.([5.44 ] ) replacing the charged @xmath287 couplings by @xmath302 couplings at the appropriate places .",
    "this introduces a relative change of sign for the @xmath20 with respect to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 contributions since @xmath303 , whereas @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "the slope of the neutral kaon form factor at @xmath96 now becomes : @xmath306 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & -0.074 \\ ; { { \\rm fm}}^2\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath307 the result @xmath308 from chiral perturbation theory is obtained . although there is a subtle cancelation involved in getting this result , it is remarkably consistent with the empirical value @xcite @xmath309 the scarce existing data of the @xmath310 electromagnetic form factor in the timelike region @xcite are also well reproduced . in summary",
    ", we find that our effective lagrangian approach , carried to one - loop order , gives a consistent and quantitatively satisfactory picture of both pion and kaon form factors .",
    "as a further test we briefly examine the three - pion spectrum produced in @xmath28 annihilation .",
    "this process dominantly involves the @xmath1 meson and its decay into @xmath312 .",
    "it is also a sensitive probe of @xmath313 mixing since the @xmath2 signal clearly shows up in the @xmath314cross section .",
    "the input for this calculation has already been prepared in section [ se432 ] where the @xmath277 decays of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been analyzed in order to fix the  anomalous ",
    "couplings @xmath315 and @xmath316 in the effective lagrangian ( see eq.(23 ) ) .",
    "furthermore we use the @xmath6 mixing parameter @xmath317 as given in section [ se42 ] .",
    "the @xmath311 total cross section can be written as a function of the squared c.m .",
    "energy @xmath318 as follows : @xmath319 here the @xmath1 and @xmath2 self - energies , @xmath320 and @xmath321 include the @xmath322 and @xmath269 channels as described in section before .",
    "in particular , the imaginary part of @xmath323 is related to the @xmath13-dependent @xmath144 decay width : @xmath324 in eq.([5.48 ] ) we have ignored the @xmath13-dependence of the @xmath1-and @xmath2-photon couplings , @xmath325 and @xmath326 , and simply used @xmath286 and @xmath327 , which is sufficiently accurate in the present context .",
    "the bare @xmath1- and @xmath2-masses are @xmath328 , @xmath329 as before .",
    "the calculated cross section ( [ 5.48 ] ) is presented in fig.12 together with the available data .",
    "the comparison is quite satisfactory , not only around the @xmath1- and @xmath2-resonance structures , but also for the @xmath322 continuum between them .",
    "the interference pattern around the @xmath2 resonance is very sensitive to the precise value of the constant @xmath330 .",
    "with @xmath331 determined by su(3 ) ( which is our input ) , the only remaining parameter is @xmath115 which in turn is constrained by the @xmath112 decay width ( see section [ se42 ] ) .",
    "one should note that @xmath115 is only determined up to a phase @xmath332 .",
    "a small @xmath333 might help to improve the comparison with the cross section above the @xmath2-resonance .",
    "together with the kaon form factor , the overall consistency in describing such a variety of data is non - trivial .",
    "we finally turn to a case which is again sensitive to @xmath6 mixing and , in addition , touches some basic questions about the @xmath13 dependence of photon - vector meson couplings .",
    "consider the dalitz decay process @xmath334 which , unlike the @xmath104 decay discussed previously , involves a virtual photon whose squared four - momentum @xmath13 is monitored by the center - of - mass energy of the produced @xmath335 pair . in our approach , the @xmath104 decay with a real photon can not be described by the sequence @xmath336 since the @xmath337 coupling vanishes at @xmath96 . on the other hand , the two - step mechanism @xmath338 does contribute to the production of @xmath335 pairs , with @xmath339 .",
    "we study the dalitz decay form factor defined by @xmath340 we include both the one - step process @xmath341 described by @xmath140 of eq.([3.17 ] ) and subsequent @xmath20 to photon conversion ( see fig.13 ) .",
    "one finds @xmath342 where the @xmath20 meson self - energy @xmath343 , its bare mass @xmath157 and the renormalized @xmath337-coupling @xmath344 have been discussed previously in section [ se51]-[se54 ] .",
    "universality in the sense of the  old  vmd model would imply @xmath345 with @xmath346 , so that in this case the form factor reduces to @xmath347 which happens to be identical to the pion form factor , @xmath348 of eq.([5.29 ] ) in the same limit . by comparison with existing data for @xmath349 ( see fig.14 ) it is clear , however , that simple universality does not seem to work .",
    "the results of the full calculation are shown in fig.14 with inclusion of @xmath6-mixing for different choices of the mixing parameter @xmath115 .",
    "as seen in section [ se43 ] the value of @xmath142 is determined through the @xmath6 mixing . as a consequence",
    "our result is very sensitive to the mixing parameter @xmath115 . for the preferred value @xmath350 the result almost coincides with that of the simple vector meson dominance model .",
    "one would have to go to smaller mixing parameters for further improvement .",
    "we want to stress that the coupling @xmath142 is determined at the physical @xmath1 meson mass .",
    "this means that any form factor multiplied to this coupling constant can not reduce the apparent discrepancy .",
    "improved data especially at small @xmath13 would be needed to reach more precise conclusions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the structure and decays of the light neutral vector mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are well described using a chiral su(3 ) effective lagrangian including anomaly terms . in particular , the @xmath13-dependent gauge invariant coupling of the vector mesons to photon gives excellent results for the pion and kaon form factors , both at timelike and spacelike @xmath13 .",
    "loop corrections produce shifts from the bare to the physical vector meson masses which turn out to be small , typically less than 10% of their physical masses .",
    "only the form factor of the dalitz decay @xmath12 still leaves some open questions .",
    "our effective lagrangian ( [ 3.11 ] ) for the interacting pseudoscalar- , vector meson and photon system derives from the systematic approach of schechter et al .",
    "@xcite which is based on chiral symmetry and gauge invariance .",
    "if we work up to quadratic order in @xmath39 the lagrangian of eq.(6 ) and ( 12 ) in ref.@xcite reads @xmath351)+i\\frac{e}{2}\\left ( 1-\\frac{k}{2 } \\right ) a_\\mu { \\rm tr } ( q [ \\partial^\\mu \\phi , \\phi ] ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the constraints @xmath352 we add the mass term for the pseudoscalar mesons , neglect for simplicity the anomaly sector and consider the vector meson masses to be equal ( su(3 ) symmetry ) .",
    "our notation for fields and coupling constants is connected to the one of schechter ( subscript s ) in the following way : @xmath353 if one considers only the @xmath20-meson , one can easily check that the lagrangian of eq.([ap1 ] ) is equivalent to a alternative method of bando et al @xcite , called hidden - symmetry approach . in the hidden - symmetry approach",
    "the @xmath20-meson is a dynamical gauge boson of a hidden local symmetry assumed to be created by quantum effects .",
    "we can transform eq.([ap1 ] ) to our @xmath13-dependent model of eqs.([3.12]-[3.14 ] ) by using @xcite @xmath354 if @xmath355 ( @xmath356 in the bando et al .",
    "model ) we get the standard vmd model with universality ( @xmath357 ) and the ksfr - relation @xcite @xmath358 . on the other hand if we take the values of @xmath73 and @xmath49 as determined from the pion form factor ( or @xmath233 decay width ) and @xmath9 scattering ( @xmath127 ) decay we find @xmath359 in schechter s approach @xmath360 and @xmath361 have to be identical ( see eqs.([ap2 ] , [ ap3 ] ) ) .",
    "we note however that this constraint @xmath362 can be released simply by adding a non minimal term ( higher order in derivatives ) proportional to @xmath363 $ ] with @xmath364 to the lagrangian of schechter @xcite . this term in invariant under @xmath365 and for electromagnetism with @xmath366",
    "it gives an additional interaction of the form added to eq.([ap1 ] ) : @xmath367 the additional term allows us to have @xmath361 and @xmath360 different from each other without violating chiral symmetry .",
    "after performing the transformation [ ap5 ] we end up with the form of the effective lagrangian given in the main text . the non minimal term in eq.([ba3 ] ) is mandatory to have @xmath49 and @xmath73 a priori unconstrained .",
    "a different way of looking at this problem has been advocated by schechter in pointing out that the vector meson and u(1)-gauge field in eq.([ap1 ] ) are not the physical ones . since there is a mixing term in the lagrangian one has to diagonalize to mass eigenstates via the transformation @xmath368 to the physical fields ( subscript p ) . applying this transformation to the interaction terms in the lagrangian",
    "one sees that the physical photon now couples directly to the pion in the form @xmath369 . obviously , after the diagonalization there is no direct interaction anymore between the physical photon and the physical vector meson .",
    "now the question arises how does the @xmath20-meson enter the pion form factor .",
    "schechter pointed out that only the u(1 ) gauge boson couples to the electron ( lepton ) by gauge invariance .",
    "after diagonalization the u(1 ) gauge field gets however an admixture of the physical @xmath370-meson .",
    "the latter now directly interacts with the electron .",
    "this new effect does not influence the low energy lepton - lepton scattering ( around @xmath96 ) , because the effective propagator of the u(1 ) gauge field is @xmath371 the pion form factor on the other hand becomes @xmath372 which is same result as in the @xmath13-dependent model ( eq.([5.21 ] ) in leading order ( without pion loops ) .",
    "we have seen that we can derive our @xmath13-dependent model from lagrangian of schechter .",
    "electromagnetisms is uniquely introduced by demanding gauge invariance for the non linear sigma model extended by the vector meson nonet . after adding the non minimal term eq.([ba3 ] )",
    "there is no need for universality and we can choose @xmath49 and @xmath73 independent from each other as done here in our @xmath13-dependent model .",
