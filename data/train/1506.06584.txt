    ". moreover , the large real - space superlattice unit cell allows observing the hofstadter butterfly @xcite at laboratory accessible field strength @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite probing the satellite structures and the hofstadter butterfly of graphene on hbn in a magnetic field have employed a varying back gate voltage ( @xmath3 ) to control the effective fermi level @xmath4 in the graphene sheet .",
    "such a measurement does not , however , provide unambiguous information on the density of states : through quantum capacitance effects and deviations from the idealized linear density of states of graphene ( caused , e.g. , by the satellite structures ) , the relation between energy and applied back gate voltage may deviate substantially from expectations @xcite .",
    "an attractive experimental alternative is magneto - spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this technique provides information on the energy difference between the ground state and the particle - hole excitation and , thus , between the different landau levels .",

    ", the magneto - optical signal can also provide information on the satellites and the evolution of associated landau levels .",
    "the observed shift of the inter - landau level transitions of graphene on different substrates can be described by a renormalized fermi velocity and attributed to many - body effects @xcite .",
    "velocity renormalization was also measured in magneto - raman scattering experiments @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we determine the magneto - optical conductivity of large ( @xmath5 ) graphene flakes where the influence of residual edge effects is suppressed by imposing a berry - mondragon potential @xcite at the boundary ( see also refs .",
    "we evaluate the optical conductivity by calculating the dipole transition between the different eigenstates of the flake , which we obtain within the third - nearest neighbor tight - binding approximation .",

    "absorption lines associated with the optical transitions between landau levels of the dirac fermions show the expected square root dependence on the magnetic field . for graphene on hbn , we observe a hofstadter butterfly on top of each transition line .",
    "the satellite structures above and below the dirac cone , which are the signatures of the brillouin zone folding in graphene aligned with hbn , are shown to contribute to the optical conductivity : our tight - binding approach predicts additional structures in the optical conductivity that evolve linearly with magnetic field , opening a pathway for optical characterization of graphene - substrate interactions .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the shift of the inter - landau levels transition lines of pristine graphene in the magnetic field due to an attraction of excited electron and hole , i.e.  magneto - excitons , on a tight - binding level .",

    "the resulting velocity renormalization agrees well with the experimental data @xcite and with complementary theoretical approaches for bulk graphene @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the present tight - binding based approach is the inclusion of spatially varying long - range potentials due to a substrate .",
    "the tight - binding ( tb ) method is very useful for simulating large - scale structures when more sophisticated techniques relying on periodic boundary conditions and small supercell sizes [ e.g. , density functional theory ( dft ) ] prove computationally challenging due to the presence of a magnetic field or additional large - scale potential variations . while for small magnetic fields ( i.e.  @xmath6 ) the density of states ( dos )",

    "this value of fermi velocity determined from dft @xcite , however , does not include the many - body effects seen in experiments @xcite and corrections discussed below .",
    "landau levels in graphene were observed in transport experiments and were measured by changing the back gate voltage @xmath3 .",
    "the back gate voltage changes the number of charge carries @xmath15 in graphene and , therefore , the fermi energy @xmath16 through capacitive coupling between the back gate and the graphene sheet , where @xmath17 , the so - called lever arm , is a measure for the coupling strength . combining eqs .",

    "the main transition lines visible in the measured infrared absorption spectra @xcite are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the analytical forms of the transition energies , which correspond to the peak positions in the associated absorption spectrum , follow from eq.([eq : lanlev ] ) as @xmath27 employing the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the tight - binding calculation for the graphene flake , it is straightforward to obtain the optical dipole transitions between the different eigenstates due to the coupling to the electromagnetic field of the infrared laser .",
    "the associated optical conductivity is given in the length gauge by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a photon frequency of the infrared laser , @xmath30 is the area of the flake , and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the eigenenergies of the flake corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the matrix element @xmath37 gives the transition dipole moment between the two eigenstates .",
    "we use the fermi distribution @xmath38 at zero temperature with the chemical potential located at the dirac point .",
    "the difference of fermi distributions , @xmath39 , is non - zero for transitions between occupied and unoccupied states corresponding to particle - hole excitation .",
    "zeros in the denominator signify resonant absorption of photons with @xmath40 . in order to avoid numerical instabilities",
    "we have introduced a line broadening of @xmath41 mev of the discrete eigenstates of the flake , which is , however , small compared to the physical width of the coarse - grained dos and , thus , of no consequence for the numerical results .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the magneto - optical conductivity calculated using eq.([eq : opt_cond2 ] ) for the pristine graphene flake [ fig.[fig : opt_cond_ideal](b , c ) ] confirm the dominance of the optically allowed transitions of the dirac cone also for the finite - size graphene flake .",

    "the valley degeneracy of the other landau levels is not lifted . the second term in eq.([eq : pot ] )",
    "is a smoothly varying potential accounting for stronger binding in regions where one sublattice of graphene is on top of boron and another sublattice is in the middle of the bn hexagon .",
    "this term accounts for the increased electron - hole asymmetry beyond the third nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation .",
    "in addition , @xmath56 may modify the fermi velocity .",
    "for the parameters of @xmath56 considered , the fermi velocity of graphene subject to superlattice potential of hbn decreases to @xmath57 m / s , which is slightly smaller than that of pristine graphene @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the last term @xmath58 in eq.([eq : pot ] ) describes , on a phenomenological level , magnetic - field dependent many - body effects and accounts for the magnetic - field induced valley splitting .",
    "the lifting of the four - fold degenerate ( two - fold for valley and two - fold for spin ) zeroth landau level was observed in graphene on sio@xmath2 @xcite , hbn @xcite and in suspended graphene @xcite . in graphene on hbn @xcite , the valley splitting was experimentally found to be linearly proportional to the magnetic field , a result which is still unexplained by theory .",
    "two alternative theoretical methods have been previously proposed to explain this observation .",
    "( i ) one model , based on the continuous dirac model in the hartree - fock approximation , predicts a @xmath59 scaling of the valley splitting @xcite .",
    "while this scaling differs from the linear scaling , the resulting numerical values for the valley splitting resembles those of the experiment within the range of investigated magnetic field strength .",
    "( ii ) the second model , based on the effect of lattice distortion and the interaction with the substrate , predicts linear scaling of valley splitting with @xmath60 but underestimates the strength of the splitting by an order of magnitude @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we account for the valley splitting within the single - electron model by applying the phenomenological potential @xmath61 , which depends linearly on the magnetic field with the spatially averaged value @xmath62 $ ] mev / t consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "the spatial variation of the potential @xmath63 follows the gaussian shape of @xmath56 , i.e.  @xmath64 .",
    "( the zeeman spin splitting , also proportional to @xmath60 , is neglected in the following ) .",
    "the dos of the graphene flake on hbn [ fig.[fig : opt_cond](a ) ] as well as the optical conductivity [ fig.[fig : opt_cond](b , c ) ] feature the square - root scaling for the @xmath65 landau levels @xmath66 of massive dirac fermions given by eq.([eq : lanlev_mod ] ) [ see black dashed curves in fig.[fig : opt_cond](a ) ] for magnetic fields up to @xmath67 t. by contrast , the linear magnetic field dependence of the zeroth landau level is determined by the effective many - body potential @xmath68 .",

    "e.g.  the @xmath43 transition , we have to include in eq.([eq : lanlev_mod ] ) the linear magnetic field dependence of the @xmath54 landau level [ see red dashed curve in fig.[fig : opt_cond](b ) ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath43 transition to the many - body valley ( and spin ) splitting in the zeroth landau level offers an alternative to activation gaps measurements.@xcite    at higher magnetic fields , the hofstadter butterfly @xcite becomes visible as `` diamond''-like structures on top of each landau level in the dos [ see fig.[fig : opt_cond](a ) at @xmath73 t ] .",
    "this phenomenon arises due to the competition between two length scales : the magnetic length @xmath74}[\\mathrm{nm}]$ ] and the scale of the hbn superlattice with a period of 14 nm . at @xmath75 t ,",
    "i.e.  when the magnetic flux through the superlattice unit cell is equal to the magnetic flux quantum , the dos features the diamonds with the largest extent .",

    "the energetic width of the diamond ( fwhm ) of the @xmath43 transition at 25 t is 20 mev corresponding to the size of the first landau level diamond obtained from the density of states [ fig.[fig : opt_cond](a ) ] .",
    "another superlattice induced effect is the presence of satellites above and below the dirac point near @xmath76 ev and @xmath77 ev at @xmath7 [ see arrows in fig.[fig : opt_cond](a ) ] , which arise due to the avoided crossings between the dirac cone and its replica .",
    "the corresponding landau levels of the satellites evolve linearly with magnetic field in the dos .",

    "the pronounced difference in the magnetic field evolution of landau levels of the satellites ( @xmath79 ) and the main dirac cone ( @xmath80 ) is not obvious when measured as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "optical transition spectroscopy appears as an attractive alternative for disentangling dirac - like and schrdinger - like dispersions in the bandstructure .",
    "magneto - optical experiments for graphene on hbn @xcite have , up to now , not focused on the satellite structures induced by the moir pattern .",
    "while challenging , the experimental observations of the satellites and their magnetic field evolution would yield valuable insight into the influence of the moir potential on the bandstructure .",
    "in the single - particle picture we used so far , the calculated optical conductivity yields the position of absorption lines @xmath81 in agreement with analytical predictions [ eq.([eq : trans ] ) ] based on the difference between the corresponding landau levels of dirac fermions [ eq.([eq : lanlev ] ) and eq.([eq : lanlev_mod ] ) ] in the experiment @xcite , however , one observes deviations which can be conveniently parameterized in terms of transition - line dependent fermi velocities @xmath82 in the @xmath83 relation ( eq.([eq : lanlev_mod ] ) ) .",
    "their origin are obviously excitonic interactions correcting for particle - hole excitations absent in addition spectroscopy when varying the back - gate potential @xmath3 .",
    "the formation of magneto - excitons @xcite by optical excitations between the landau levels is a many - body effect .",
    "to lowest order the excitonic wave function is a product of an electron and a hole wave function : @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is an electron ( hole ) coordinate , @xmath87 and @xmath88 correspond to the wave functions of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 landau levels undergoing optical transitions .",

    "we use the value of @xmath95 found for graphene on sio@xmath2 within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and also for graphene on hbn @xcite . in the absence of the coulomb interaction [ second term in @xmath96 , eq.([eq : exc ] ) ] the excitonic energy coincides with eq.([eq : trans ] ) , i.e.  the single - particle energy difference .",
    "the coulomb interaction changes the transition energies and leads to the observed energy shift due to particle - hole attraction .",
    "magneto - excitonic effects were studied in detail for the two - dimensional electron gas @xcite ( 2deg ) and for graphene @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the excitation energy consists of several contributions : ( i ) the ( non - interacting ) single - particle exciton energy @xmath97 ( eq.([eq : lanlev_mod ] ) ) ; ( ii ) the direct coulomb two - particle interaction between the particle and the hole ; ( iii ) the annihilation and creation of electron - hole pairs at different points of the brillouin zone ; and ( iv ) the exchange interaction . the direct coulomb term ( ii )",
    "is negative and gives rise to the excitonic binding .",
    "therefore , the optical transition energy is reduced relative to the estimate in the single - particle picture .",
    "contributions ( iii ) and ( iv ) provide positive higher - order corrections , slightly reducing the coulomb attraction .",
    "since this effect is already , to a certain extent , empirically accounted for by the dielectric response of the medium @xmath93 , we neglect an explicit treatment of these terms .        within the tight - binding approximation applied to graphene dots , it is possible to treat magneto - excitonic effects . for comparison with the experiment",
    "we include the dielectric environment for graphene on a sio@xmath2 substrate by taking into account the dielectric constant @xmath98 when evaluating the coulomb interaction term .",
    "we treat the direct coulomb electron - hole interaction in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "consider an optical transition between the two landau levels @xmath11 and @xmath99 .",
    "each of the landau levels comprises a large number of eigenstates of the flake [ see fig.([fig : opt_cond_ideal](a ) ) ] .",
    "a photoexcited state can be written as a superposition of flake eigenstates with energies in a vicinity of the optically excited landau levels : @xmath100 the expansion coefficients @xmath101 can be obtained by inserting eq.([eq : wf ] ) into the dirac equation eq.([eq : exc ] ) : @xmath102 with @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) being eigenenergies of the flake in the vicinity of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) landau level .",
    "the coulomb matrix element is @xmath105 eq.([eq : bse ] ) can be viewed as the bethe-salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite adapted for a finite - size graphene flake .",
    "the coulomb integral eq.([eq : matrix_el ] ) gives rise to the exciton binding energy .",
    "the full solution of eq.([eq : bse ] ) is numerically challenging as the size of the subspace coupled by the coulomb matrix is given by the product of the number of particle and hole states for each landau level .",
    "for each landau level involved in the transition , we consider the energetically closest @xmath106 eigenstates of the flake .",
    "given the size of our model system , we find that using @xmath107 30@xmath10840 ( depending on the magnetic field and the landau level index ) is a good compromise between accuracy and numerical effort : the matrix dimensions of @xmath109 are given by @xmath110 , were the evaluation of each matrix element requires a double spatial integral with a coulomb kernel . to keep the problem numerically manageable , we ( i )",
    "restrict ourselves to first - order perturbation theory @xcite , i.e.  we include only the diagonal coulomb matrix elements @xmath111 in eq.([eq : bse ] ) and ( ii ) reduce the size of the graphene flake to @xmath112 , to speed up the calculation of each matrix element . as we verified numerically ,",

    "when comparing the noninteracting single particle picture [ black traces in fig.[fig : excitons](a , b , c ) ] with the two - particle correction [ green traces in fig.[fig : excitons](a , b , c ) ] .",
    "the position and the width of the spectral lines is determined by their first and second moments . neglecting the excitonic effect the transition energies [ black dots in fig.[fig : excitons](d ) ] agree well with the analytical prediction for inter - landau levels optical transitions given by eq.([eq : trans ] ) [ black curves in fig.[fig : excitons](d ) ] with a fermi velocity @xmath120 m / s determined by our choice of tight - binding parameters for pristine graphene .",

    "such a velocity renormalization , also seen in the experiment @xcite , clearly reflects excitonic effects . to distinguish effects of the landau - level specific velocity renormalization from other bandstructure effects that uniformly affect all transitions , we consider the ratio of the renormalized fermi velocities of t@xmath125 transitions to that of t@xmath118 .",
    "we find reasonable agreement with the experiments @xcite measuring optical inter - landau levels transitions for graphene on sio@xmath2 and also with alternative theoretical approaches for bulk graphene @xcite [ fig.[fig : excitons](e ) ] .",
    "the present tight binding ansatz allows for including long - range disorder , such as puddles observed in graphene on sio@xmath2 .",
    "we account for the effects of charge puddles by applying a smooth disorder potential with an amplitude of 25 mev ( 50 mev ) and a correlation length of 10 nm ( 5 nm ) @xcite .",

    "this mismatch arises from a substantially ( @xmath126 ) lower experimental value of @xmath127 than theoretical predictions and was attributed to many - body effects influencing the zeroth landau level @xcite .",
    "corrections to the dielectric response of the material ( i.e. , the effective @xmath93 ) should affect all transitions similarly , and thus can not explain the observed large ratio @xmath128 .",
    "one effect large enough to explain these findings is the substantial splitting of the four - fold degenerate landau levels of pristine graphene , as found for graphene on hbn in , e.g. , quantum capacitance measurements @xcite .",
    "however , any such splitting should shift the @xmath43 line to higher photon energies [ as seen in fig.[fig : opt_cond](b , c ) ] , i.e.  in the opposite direction to that observed in the experiment . clearly , future magneto - optical experiments for graphene on hbn are called for to shed more light on this puzzle .",
    "one remark should be added regarding the large values of the magnetic fields used in the simulations to map out landau levels . since we consider a flake of a smaller size than in the previous section , the landau levels emerge at higher magnetic fields . in particular , the landau level @xmath11 is formed as soon as @xmath129 is smaller than the smallest dimension of the flake .",
