    "viscous fingers form when in a thin linear channel or hele - shaw cell , a fluid pushes a more viscous fluid .",
    "the interface between the fluids develops an instability leading to the formation of finger - like patterns .",
    "the viscous fingering instability has been studied intensively over the past few decades both theoretically and experimentally .    for the classical saffman - taylor instability the width of the finger",
    "is governed by the competition between viscous and capillary forces : viscous forces tend to narrow the finger whereas capillary forces tend to widen it .",
    "when air pushes a viscous fluid , as is usually the case , the relative finger width is thus determined by the capillary number @xmath0 , ( with @xmath1 the viscosity , @xmath2 the velocity and @xmath3 the surface tension ) the ratio between viscous and capillary forces . in the vast majority of cases that have been studied so far , inertial forces are negligible .",
    "the importance of inertia is given by the relative importance of the inertial and viscous forces , quantified by the reynolds number @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the fluid density , and @xmath6 the plate spacing of the hele - shaw cell in which the experiments are conducted .",
    "in most studies of the instability , @xmath6 is small , and the fluids considered both in applications as well as in experimental studies are typically high - viscosity oils .",
    "this automatically leads to small reynolds numbers ( @xmath7 ) , so that inertial effects may be neglected .",

    "for the dilute polymer solutions used in a number of these studies , the shear viscosity of the water - based solutions is typically close to the water viscosity , and consequently the reynolds number may -and does- become larger than unity .",
    "this means that inertia may become important , and needs to be disentangled from the observed non - newtonian flow effects .",
    "also recently , corrections to the so called darcy s law have been developed incorporating inertial effects ( see * ? ? ?",

    "darcy s law relates the pressure gradient to the fluid velocity and is one of the fundamental equations of the saffman - taylor instability ; if inertial corrections can simply be included in a modified darcy s law , this would greatly facilitate the understanding of the effect of inertia on the instability .",
    "these recent developments suggest that a better understanding of the newtonian fingering instability for high reynolds numbers is both necessary and feasible .    in this paper",

    "we study the saffman - taylor instability in a thin linear channel or hele - shaw cell ( see figure [ hs ] ) .",
    "the width of the cell @xmath9 is chosen to be large compared to the channel thickness @xmath6 and we thus work with high aspect ratios @xmath10 .",
    "the cell is filled with a viscous fluid which is subsequently pushed by air .",
    "the viscosity and the density of air will be neglected throughout the paper .        when air pushes the viscous fluid due to an imposed pressure gradient @xmath11 , an initially flat interface between the two fluids destabilizes .",
    "this destabilisation leads to the formation of a so called viscous finger ; in steady state a stationary finger of width @xmath12 propagating at a velocity @xmath2 is found to occupy a fraction of the cell width : the relative finger width is defined as : @xmath13 .    for newtonian fluids , the motion of a fluid in the hele - shaw cell is described by the two - dimensional velocity field @xmath14 averaged through the thickness of the cell .",
    "it is given by darcy s law , which relates the local pressure gradient to the velocity within the fluid as : @xmath15    it follows immediately that , if the fluid is incompressible , the pressure field satisfies laplace s equation : @xmath16    the pressure field is calculated within the driven fluid with in addition a pressure jump over the interface due to the surface tension : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the radius of curvature of the interface , again employing a two - dimensional approximation , as was justified in the limit of small capillary numbers by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the other boundary conditions are the continuity condition , which implies that the normal velocity at both sides of the interface is equal and a far - field value for the pressure . supplemented with these boundary conditions , ( [ darcy1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ laplp ] ) and ( [ deltp ] ) constitute the complete set of equations one can solve in order to obtain the complete finger shape for a given pressure gradient ; and thus also its width .    for characterizing the instability quantitatively most studies have focused on the width of the finger @xmath12 relative to the channel width @xmath9 : @xmath13 as a function of their velocity .",
    "it follows from the above that their width is determined by the capillary number ; one thus anticipates that the relative width of the viscous fingers decreases with increasing finger velocity .",
    "this is indeed what is generally observed experimentally ; in addition , for very large values of , @xmath19 does not go to zero but reaches a limiting value of about half the channel width .",
    "it also follows from the boundary conditions and ( [ darcy1 ] ) to ( [ deltp ] ) , that the control parameter for the fingering problem is @xmath20 with @xmath10 the aspect ratio of the hele - shaw cell . when scaled on , measurements of @xmath19 for different systems all fall on the same universal curve . in the ideal ,",

    "when inertial forces have to be taken into account , both the reynolds number @xmath21 or the weber number @xmath22 ( the ratio of inertial forces to capillarity forces ) may become important .",
    "we will now discuss how corrections due to inertia can be included in the basic equations .",
    "modifications of darcy s law have first been proposed by @xcite for parallel flow in a hele - shaw cell : they establish corrections by averaging inertia in the third dimension , i.e. , they average over the direction of the plate spacing @xmath6 , allowing them to derive a new nonlinear two - dimensional equation for the velocity field .",
    "@xcite suggests an improved correction starting from the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation .",
    "inertial corrections are introduced in a perturbative fashion ; using in addition a polynomial approximation to the velocity field , ruyer - quil proposes the modified two - dimensional darcy s law of the form : @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite also calculated inertial corrections to darcy s law and arrive at a similar type of equation , but with slightly different coefficients .",
    "this equation leads to a better agreement between the linear stability analysis and the experimental data of gondret & rabaud for the kelvin - helmholtz instability up to not too large reynolds numbers . @xmath26 and @xmath27 may vary depending on the way the averaging in the third dimension is done , but are always of order of 1 .    when scaling length on @xmath9 , time on @xmath28 and pressure on @xmath29 one finds the following dimensionless equation : @xmath30  is a modified reynolds number , in the same way as the classical control parameter of the saffman - taylor instability  is a modified capillary number .",
    "we can also introduce another number describing the importance between inertia and capillarity in the geometry of the hele - shaw , a modified weber number : @xmath31    one important remark is that if one considers stationary and spatially uniform flow in our hele - shaw cell , it follows from ( [ darcy2 ] ) that there are no corrections due to inertia , since @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both zero",
    ". this will be the case in our fingering experiments far away from the moving interface and leads to the classical darcy s law ; we thus anticipate that it might remain valid even for relatively high .",
    "we use a linear hele - shaw cell consisting of two glass plates separated by a thin mylar spacer .",
    "the plates are horizontal and clamped together in order to obtain a regular thickness @xmath6 of the channel .",
    "the thickness of the glass plates is chosen to be 2  in order to avoid any bending of the plates .",
    "the aspect ratio of the channel can be varied ; we worked with different plate spacings @xmath6 and widths of the cell @xmath9 , the length of the channel being always 1 .",
    "the cell is filled with silicone oil and compressed air is used as the less viscous driving fluid .",
    "the silicone oils used were rhodorsil 47v05 , 47v10 , 47v20 and 47v100 from rhodia silicones .",
    "rheological measurements on a reologica stress - tech rheometer confirmed the values of the viscosities @xmath1 of 5 , 10 , 20 and 100  respectively , with no deviations larger than 4% .",
    "we also used 47v02 , its viscosity was measured to be 2.8 .",
    "the surface tension @xmath3 and the density @xmath5 of the silicone oils are 19.5  @xmath34  and 0.95  @xmath35  @xmath36  as given by rhodia silicones .",
    "the fingers were driven by applying a constant pressure drop @xmath37 between the inlet and the outlet of the cell .",
    "depending on the order of magnitude of the applied pressure drop two methods were used . for @xmath38",
    "larger than 3000  we used compressed air and a pressure transducer at the entrance of the cell to fix @xmath39 at the inlet of the cell . in this case",
    ", the outlet was maintained at atmospheric pressure @xmath40 due to an oil reservoir coupled to the cell . for a @xmath38",
    "smaller than 3000 , we obtained the pressure drop by lowering the oil reservoir at the outlet of the cell by a given amount , determining in this way @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the inlet was maintained at atmospheric pressure @xmath42 .",
    "the fingers were captured by a ccd camera , coupled to a data acquisition card ( national instruments ) and a computer .",
    "this allowed for measurements of the relative width @xmath43 as a function of the velocity @xmath2 of the finger tip .",
    "for each configuration ( cell geometry and fluid viscosity ) several experimental runs ( between 10 and 20 ) were performed increasing the applied pressure drop and thus the finger velocity until destabilization of the finger occurred ; all the finger widths reported here correspond to stable fingers .    in order to access high reynolds numbers we can not only vary the velocity of the finger and the viscosity of the fluid but also change the thickness of the channel .",
    "we have thus worked with different channel geometries that are summarized on table [ dimen ] .",
    ".different cell geometries used in our experiments .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     for the geometries used , the aspect ratio @xmath10 varies from 28 ( geometry 4 ) to 160 ( geometry 1 ) . even if an aspect ratio of 28 is rather small it is sufficient to consider the experiment as being quasi two - dimensional .",
    "it is observed that the results obtained for the high viscosity fluids ( and thus a situation where inertial effects can be neglected ) show only very little difference in their finger widths .",
    "the small difference is due to film effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "experiments were performed in all geometries for the silicon oils 47v05 , 47v10 and 47v20 .",
    "the silicon oil 47v02 was tested in geometries 2 and 3 , whereas the silicon oil 47v100 was used in geometries 3 and 4 .",
    "finally , note that typical values of capillary number  in the experiments are between 0.01 ( for v02 ) and 0.5 ( for v100 ) .",
    "assuming the flow far away from the finger to be uniform , we expect that the classical darcy s law linking the gap averaged fluid velocity @xmath44 to the imposed pressure gradient @xmath11 in our hele - shaw cell remains valid for all of our experiments : @xmath45    mass conservation allows to obtain the velocity @xmath44 of the fluid far away from the interface from the measured finger velocity @xmath2 simply by using @xmath46 , if one neglects the thin wetting film left on the glass plates behind the finger .",

    "it is also important to note that strong inertial effects are observed already at velocities below 0.08  for all of our experiments and that even if strong changes in the behaviour are observed for the finger width , no deviations from the classical darcy law is observed in this regime ( figure  [ gdarcy ] ) .",
    "we will now study the deviation from the classical result as a function of the modified reynolds number .",
    "for concreteness , in the following we will focus on the data obtained when varying the viscosity for a given geometry ( @xmath6=0.75 , @xmath9=4 ) .",

    "high  all the curves tend towards a single master curve : the behaviour of the finger width seems to be governed by  only .",
    "data in other configurations ( not shown here ) confirm the existence of a universal @xmath19-curve .",
    "so far we can distinguish between two limiting cases . for low velocities , the results for the relative finger width fall on the universal curve of the classical saffman - taylor instability : they rescale with . for high values velocity , a second universal curve exists and the data rescale with .",
    "it follows that the crossover between the two regimes is given by the modified weber number , combining  and : @xmath64    the experimental data support this conclusion .",

    "all experimental curves have a minimum located at the same value of  at around  @xmath65  15 separating the two limiting behaviours .",
    "note that , although  governs the crossover , we observe no regime where the finger width is given by a competition between capillary forces and inertia .",
    "in fact , when considering the dependence of the different forces on the velocity one finds that capillary forces scale as @xmath66 , viscous forces as @xmath67 and inertial forces as @xmath68 . consequently , the dominating forces should at low velocity be capillary and viscous forces ( control parameter ) and at high velocity , viscous forces versus inertia ( control parameter ) .",

    "when comparing the simulations and the experiments ( see figure [ numeric]b ) it turns out that they are in qualitative agreement but that the results are not identical .    when inertial effects are present we can characterize these effects by estimating a critical value of the control parameter  and a critical relative width @xmath108 at the minimum .",
    "it turns out that the numerics provide a rather good estimate for @xmath108 but fall to give a correct value for  which is found to be smaller in the numerical simulations than in the experiments .",
    "another significant difference is that the increase of the @xmath19-  curve is observed to be stronger in the simulations .",
    "however , even for the case where inertia can be neglected ( for most viscous fluid ) , there is a small but significant discrepancy between the numerical simulations and the experimental data .",
    "we believe this is due to the fact that our way of correcting for the wetting film is too simple . in consequence , it is clear that we can not expect perfect agreement between experimental data and simulations when adding corrections due to inertia .",
    "to quantitatively account for the experimental results , one has certainly to go back to the three - dimensional effects of the experiment which are expected to be important close to the finger tip over a length scale of order @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to the existence of a three - dimensional structure of the flow which can not be ignored in the vicinity of the finger : a film exists between the plate and the finger . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that it is nevertheless possible to reduce the problem to two dimensions when modifying the boundary conditions on the finger ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , they have also shown that reduction to two - dimensional is only possible if the parameter @xmath109 is small . for our problem , this is not the case and therefore a complete set of the corrected boundary conditions must be deduced from the full three - dimensional theory of park , homsy and reinelt incorporating inertial effects in order to resolve the problem , which is largely beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have investigated the effect of inertia on the saffman - taylor instability .",
    "inertial effects are found to become important for high reynolds numbers and thus for fluids of low viscosity and for large plate spacing of the hele - shaw cell .",
    "for these situations one observes , upon increasing the velocity , first a classical regime with a decrease of the relative finger width and then a second and new regime in which the finger width increases .",
    "this second regime is due to the importance of inertia .",
    "we introduced a modified weber number  which allowed us to explain the crossover between the two regimes . the transition is thus given by a critical modified weber number .",
    "below , the classical regime of decreasing finger width is of course governed by the classical control parameter , which is a modified capillary number .",
    "the finger width in this regime is thus given by the balance between capillary forces , which tend to widen the finger , and viscous forces , which tend to narrow the finger .",
    "with increasing velocity the viscous forces dominate over the capillary forces and one observes a narrowing of the finger . for the second regime , above , one observes on the contrary an increase of the finger width with increasing velocity . in this case",
    "the finger width is governed by a modified reynolds number  and thus by the balance between viscous forces and inertia .",
    "it turnsout that inertial forces tend to widen the finger",
    ". with increasing velocity inertia dominates the viscous forces and one consequently observes a widening of the fingers .    we have also shown that we can define a new control parameter , which takes the corrections due to inertia into account .",
    "this parameter tends towards  for low  and is proportional to 1/  for large . when plotting our data as a function of this empirical parameter they collapse onto a single universal curve which corresponds to the results for the finger width obtained for the classical saffman - taylor instability .    by only taking into account a modification of darcy s law ,",
    "some simple arguments and numerical simulations confirm all of these observations .",
    "however , the agreement between numerics and experiments is only qualitative .",
    "we believe this is due to the fact that the problem is certainly three - dimensional and one must consider the full three - dimensional theory of park , homsy and reinelt incorporating inertial effects ."
