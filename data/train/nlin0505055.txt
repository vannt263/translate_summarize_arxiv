    "universal level statistics of classically chaotic systems in agreement with the rmt ( random matrix theory ) prediction has been intensively studied since it was conjectured two decades ago@xcite .",
    "berry@xcite first evaluated the first order term of the spectral form factor using the semiclassical periodic orbit theory@xcite .",
    "his method is called the diagonal approximation .",
    "it is applicable to both of the goe ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) and gue ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) universality classes . in the absence of time",
    "reversal invariance , the first order term is evaluated as a sum over the periodic orbits and agrees with the prediction derived from the gue of random matrices .",
    "if the system is time reversal invariant , we additionally need to sum up over the pairs of the periodic orbits mutually time reverse .",
    "the result is also in agreement with the rmt prediction derived from the goe .",
    "recently sieber and richter ( sr ) showed that a family of orbit pairs with an encounter gave the first correction to the diagonal approximation @xcite .",
    "their idea clarifies what corresponds to the _ order _ of each term in the context of the periodic orbit theory .",
    "heusler et al .",
    "@xcite further generalized sr s idea by using a combinatorial analysis and mller et al.@xcite obtained the full expansion which yields the rmt form factor .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the form factor of chaotic systems in a weak magnetic field , extending the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "our aim is to reproduce the universal level statistics in the crossover domain between the goe and gue universality classes .",
    "the corresponding rmt formula is derived from pandey and mehta s two matrix model@xcite .",
    "this formula interpolates the form factors of goe and gue , which correspond to chaotic systems without and with a magnetic field , respectively . using a quantum graph ,",
    "the authors previously obtained the second order term by employing sieber and richter s periodic orbit pairs and showed that it agreed with the rmt prediction@xcite . here",
    "we consider the third order term of the form factor and clarify a mechanism to yield the rmt expression .",
    "we show that the rmt expression is obtained by taking account of the interference of the gauge potential in the encounters of periodic orbits .",
    "let us explicitly present the rmt prediction of the form factor .",
    "it is derived from pandey and mehta s two matrix model , as explained in@xcite . for small @xmath2 , the rmt form factor @xmath3 with a parameter @xmath4 is written as k_rm ( ) & = & + 12 _ 1 - 2 ^ 1 dk k k + 2 e^-(k + ) + & = & + e^- - 2 ^ 2 e^- + ^3 ( ^2 6 e^- + 2 e^- ) + . [ pd ]    the goe and gue limits correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . up to the second order of @xmath7 ,",
    "each term is a monotonic function of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "however , the third order term in ( [ pd ] ) includes a peculiar nonmonotonic term @xmath8 , which vanishes in both of the goe and gue limits .",
    "such terms generally appear in higher order contributions .",
    "we can thus expect that a semiclassical analysis of the third order term will offer a basis to reproduce the full expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a quantum system in a magnetic field and assume that the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic . in the semiclassical limit @xmath9 , the form factor of such a system can be formally written in terms of the classical periodic orbits@xcite ; k_po ( ) = _ , ",

    "the phase @xmath14 is an effect of the gauge potential in the action along the orbit @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath15 , using the gauge potential @xmath16 at the position @xmath17 .",
    "the angular bracket stands for an average over the mean energy @xmath18 and over a time interval much smaller than the heisenberg time @xmath19 .",
    "since the classical dynamics is chaotic , each periodic orbit shows a diffusive behavior@xcite ; successive changes of the velocity can be regarded as independent events .",
    "hence , if the time @xmath20 elapsed on an orbit @xmath13 is sufficiently large , we assume that the term @xmath21 can be replaced by the gaussian white noise satisfying the correlation @xmath22 . here",

    "incorporating such a gaussian average , we obtain a formula k_po ( ) = _ ,  a_a_^ e^i ( s _ -s_ ) / e^ i ( _ - _  ) / ( - t _ + t_ 2t_h ) .",

    "the rmt parameter @xmath4 is identified with @xmath32 .",
    "we next consider the second order term . as shown by sieber and richter ( sr ) @xcite ,",

    "let us express @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the time reversal operator ) in terms of the pairwise normalized vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 as @xmath51 . to demand that the orbits in the encounter are mutually close , we introduce a bound @xmath52 and assume that @xmath53 .",
    "then the partner orbit @xmath40 ( or the time reverse of @xmath40 ) pierces at @xmath54 and at @xmath55 .",
    "we can consequently estimate the duration @xmath56 of the encounter and the action difference @xmath57 for the two orbits as t_enc = 1 s = us , where @xmath58 is the liapunov exponent .",

    "we will find that the calculation is somewhat different from the second order term because the interference of the gauge potential in the encounter regions gives a significant contribution .",
    "for the periodic orbit pairs which contribute to the third order term , heusler et al.@xcite introduced several notations ( aas , api , ppi , ac and pc ) . in order to take account of the time reversal of the orbit @xmath70",

    "one might think that @xmath105 and @xmath106 should disappear in the limit @xmath107 , because a pair of mutually time reversed loops exists .",
