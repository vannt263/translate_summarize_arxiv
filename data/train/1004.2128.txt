    "the shastry - sutherland lattice ( ssl ) was considered more than 20 years ago by shastry and sutherland  @xcite as an interesting example of a frustrated quantum spin system with an exact ground state .",
    "it can be described as a square lattice with antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath6 between nearest neighbors and additional antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath7 between next - nearest neighbors in every second square ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this lattice attracted much attention after its experimental realization in the @xmath8 compound  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a fascinating sequence of magnetization ( @xmath91/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 and 1/8 of the saturated magnetization @xmath10 ) in this material  @xcite stimulated further theoretical and experimental studies of the ssl  @xcite .",
    "as another realization of the ssl the rare - earth tetraborid @xmath11 has recently been studied in finite magnetic fields  @xcite . since fully polarized state can be reached for experimentally accessible magnetic fields , this compound allows exploration of its complete magnetization process .",
    "it was found that the magnetization diagram of @xmath11 consists of magnetization plateaus located at small fractional values of @xmath91/7 , 1/8 , 1/9 @xmath12 of the saturated magnetization , followed by the major magnetization plateau located at @xmath13 .",
    "note that , due to large total magnetic moments of the magnetic ions , this compound can be considered as a classical system .",
    "moreover , because of strong crystal field effects , the effective spin model for @xmath11 has been suggested to be described by the spin-1/2 shastry - sutherland model under strong ising ( or easy - axis ) anisotropy  @xcite . from this point of view",
    "it was natural to begin a description of magnetization process in the @xmath11 material from the ising limit on the ssl that can be , in the presence of a finite magnetic field @xmath14 , expressed as follows @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17-component of a spin-1/2 degree of freedom on site @xmath18 of a square lattice and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between all nearest neighbor bonds ( @xmath6 ) and next - nearest neighbor bonds in every second square ( @xmath7 ) , as indicated in fig .  1",
    ". +     bonds along the edges of the squares and @xmath7 along the diagonals.,width=226 ]    in spite the relative simplicity of the model hamiltonian ( 1 ) , fully different conclusions have been obtained for the magnetization curve of this model within various approaches .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found , analyzing a finite system consisting of 16 spins , a single magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the saturated magnetization in accordance with experimental data in @xmath11 .",
    "however , numerical simulations obtained within the monte - carlo and tensor renormalization group methods on much larger systems  @xcite did not confirm this conclusion .",
    "in contrast to previous results they showed that the ising model on the ssl exhibits in the presence of the magnetic field the magnetization plateau only at 1/3 of the saturated magnetization .",
    "thus the different conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite appears to be due to the usage of inappropriate finite lattice sizes .",
    "the existence of the magnetization plateau at only 1/3 of the saturated magnetization and its absence at 1/2 indicates that it is necessary to go beyond the classical ising limit to reach the correct description of the magnetization process in @xmath11 and other rare - earth tetraborides .",
    "the first such an attempt has been done by meng and wessel  @xcite who studied the spin-1/2 easy - axis heisenberg model on the ssl with ferromagnetic transverse spin exchange using quantum monte - carlo and degenerate perturbation theory . besides the magnetization plateau at 1/3 of the saturated magnetization they found a further plateau at 1/2 , which persists only in the quantum regime .",
    "the same results have been obtained by liu and sachdev analyzing the perturbative effects of the transverse fluctuations on the ssl spin multiplets with large easy - axis anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a similar behavior as for @xmath11 has been also observed for other rare - earth tetraborides .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 the magnetization plateau has been found at @xmath13  @xcite , for @xmath20 at @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite and for @xmath23 at @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "in the current paper we present an alternative model of stabilization the magnetization plateaus in the rare - earth tetraborides based on the fact that these materials , in contrast to @xmath8 , are metallic .",
    "thus for a correct description of ground - state properties of rare - earth tetraborides one should take into account both spin and electron subsystems as well as the coupling between them .",
    "supposing that electron and spin subsystems interact only via the spin dependent ising interaction @xmath0 , the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant electrons in the @xmath29-band wannier state at site  @xmath18 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first term of ( 2 ) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum - mechanical hopping of the itinerant @xmath29 electrons between sites @xmath18 and @xmath31 .",
    "these intersite hopping transitions are described by the matrix elements @xmath32 , which are @xmath33 if @xmath18 and @xmath31 are the nearest neighbors , @xmath34 if @xmath18 and @xmath31 are the next - nearest neighbors from the ssl and zero otherwise .",
    "the second term represents the above mentioned anisotropic , spin - dependent local interaction of the ising type between the localized spins and itinerant electrons .",
    "the third term describes an action of the magnetic field on the itinerant electrons .    to examine the magnetization curve corresponding to the model hamiltonian ( 2 ) , we have used the well - controlled numerical method that we have elaborated recently to study the ground states of the spinless / spin - one - half falicov - kimball model   @xcite .",
    "this method is described in detail in our previous papers  @xcite and thus we summarize here only the main steps of the algorithm : ( i ) chose a trial spin configuration @xmath35 .",
    "( ii ) having @xmath36 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 fixed , find all eigenvalues @xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "( iii ) for a given @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the total number of electrons ) determine the ground - state energy @xmath41 of a particular spin configuration @xmath36 by filling in the lowest @xmath42 one - electron levels @xmath37 .",
    "( iv ) generate a new configuration @xmath43 by flipping a randomly chosen spin .",
    "( v ) calculate the ground - state energy @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 the new configuration is accepted , otherwise @xmath43 is rejected .",
    "then the steps ( ii)-(v ) are repeated until the convergence ( for given parameters of the model ) is reached .",
    "using the method discussed above we have performed exhaustive numerical studies of the model ( 2 ) for a wide range of model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 selected on the base of experimental measurements  @xcite . to exclude the finite size effects",
    "the numerical calculations have been done for several different shastry - sutherland clusters consisting of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 sites .",
    "the most important result obtained from these calculations is that the ground - state spin arrangements exhibit the same structure for all examined finite clusters .    ) that are stable on finite intervals of @xmath14 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the big ( small ) dots correspond to the up ( down ) spin orientation . ]    in general , this structure is formed by parallel antiferromagnetic bands separated by ferromagnetic stripes and does not depend on the anisotropic spin - dependent interaction @xmath0 as well as nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping integrals @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the complete list of the ground - state spin arrangements ( for @xmath54 ) that are stable on finite intervals of magnetic field values are depicted on fig .  2 .",
    "the second important observation is that the width @xmath55 of the antiferromagnetic bands can not be arbitrary , but fulfill severe restrictions .",
    "indeed , we have found that with exception the case @xmath56 , in all remaining cases the permitted width of the antiferromagnetic band is only @xmath55 or @xmath57 , where @xmath55 is the even number .",
    "this fact is very important from the numerical point of view since it allows us to perform the numerical calculations on much larger clusters with the extrapolated set of configurations of the above described type .",
    "the resulting magnetization curves obtained on the extrapolated set of ground - state spin configurations consisting of parallel antiferromagnetic bands of width @xmath55 ( @xmath55 and @xmath57 ) separated by ferromagnetic stripes are shown in figs .  3 - 5 for selected values of model parameters , that represent the typical behavior of the model . +    , @xmath58 and different values of @xmath59 .",

    "inset : magnetization curves of spin and electron subsystems . ]",
    "+ one can see that the switching on the spin - dependent interaction @xmath0 between the electron and spin subsystems and taking into account the electron hopping on the nearest ( @xmath1 ) and next - nearest ( @xmath2 ) lattice sites of the ssl leads to a stabilization of new magnetization plateaus .",
    "in addition to the ising magnetization plateau at @xmath65 we have found two new magnetization plateaus located at @xmath56 and @xmath66 .",
    "the ground - state spin arrangements corresponding to these magnetization plateaus have the same structure consisting of parallel antiferromagnetic bands of a width @xmath55 ( where @xmath67 for @xmath4 , @xmath68 for @xmath3 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) separated by ferromagnetic stripes .",
    "thus , our numerical results show that besides the pure spin mechanism ( e.g. , the easy - axis heisenberg model on the ssl  @xcite ) of stabilization the magnetization plateaus in rare - earth tetraborides , there exists also an alternative mechanism based on the coexistence of electron and spin subsystems that are present in these materials . from this point of view",
    "it is interesting to compare in detail the ground states obtained within these two different approaches . for @xmath65",
    "our results are identical with ones obtained within the ising  @xcite as well as easy - axis heisenberg  @xcite model on the ssl .",
    "the accordance between our and the easy - axis heisenberg solution  @xcite is found surprisingly also for @xmath56 . in this case",
    "both approaches predict the sequence of parallel antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic stripes . for @xmath66",
    "our results postulate a new type of spin ordering . +    , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath71 and different values of @xmath59 .",
    "inset : magnetization curves of spin and electron subsystems . ]",
    "+ while the magnetization plateaus at @xmath56 and 1/3 have been really found in the rare - earth tetraborides  @xcite , the 1/5-magnetization plateau in these compounds absent . instead",
    "the 1/5-magnetization plateau there have been observed magnetization plateaus at smaller values of @xmath72 , and namely , at @xmath73 , 1/9 and 1/11 ( @xmath11  @xcite ) .",
    "since the sizes of selected clusters ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) are not dividable by 7 , 9 and 11 the absence of magnetization plateaus at 1/7 , 1/9 and 1/11 is nothing surprising . to verify the possibilities of existence",
    "the magnetization plateaus at @xmath76 and 1/11 one has to examine much larger lattices .",
    "unfortunately , due to the numerical limitations we are able to study clusters only slightly higher than 120 sites .",
    "such cluster sizes ( e.g. , @xmath77 ) are sufficient for investigation the stability of @xmath73 magnetization plateau , but they are too small for verification the magnetization plateaus at @xmath78 and 1/11 . in fig .",
    "6 we present magnetization curves obtained on clusters consisting of @xmath79 and @xmath80 sites together with the magnetization curve for @xmath81 . comparing these results one can see that a new magnetization plateau at @xmath73 is formed and that the region of its stability is practically independent of @xmath59 .",
    "+    , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath62 and different values of @xmath59 .",
    "inset : a detail of magnetization curves for small @xmath14 . ]",
    "+ although we have considered the clusters of different classes ( the @xmath79 and @xmath80 clusters are not dividable by 3 and the @xmath75 cluster is not dividable by 7 ) the convergence of numerical results to 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/5 and 1/7 plateaus is apparent , what indicates that at least these plateaus persist in the thermodynamic limit . it is not excluded that on much larger clusters also the magnetic plateaus at 1/9 and 1/11 are stable .",
    "this conjecture supports the fact that the 1/9 and 1/11 phases have the same type of the ground - state spin ordering ( consisting of parallel antiferromagnetic bands ( of the even width @xmath55 ) separated by ferromagnetic stripes ) as the stable phases corresponding to the magnetization plateaus at 1/3 , 1/5 and 1/7 .",
    "however , with respect to our numerical results ( presented above ) showing on the strong suppression of the plateau width with decreasing @xmath72 we expect that the stability region of 1/9 and 1/11 phases will be very narrow .",
    "the magnetization process of the electron subsystem is very similar to one described above for the spin subsystem , but only in the limit @xmath82 ( see insets in figs .  3 - 5 ) .",
    "indeed , we have found that for @xmath83 the magnetization curves of electron and spin subsystems fully coincide for the strong coupling ( @xmath62 ) between electron and spin subsystems , and small deviations are observed only for the intermediate coupling ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , a different picture of magnetization processes of electron and spin subsystems is observed in the limit @xmath85 . in this limit",
    "the spin subsystem is already fully saturated while the magnetization of the electron subsystem changes continuously from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .    in summary , we have presented an alternative model of stabilization the magnetization plateaus in rare - earth tetraborides based on the coexistence of spin and electron subsystems ( coupled by the anisotropic spin - dependent interaction of the ising type ) in these materials .",
    "it was shown that the switching on the spin - dependent interaction between the electron and spin subsystems and taking into account the electron hopping on the nearest and next - nearest lattice sites of the ssl leads to a stabilization of magnetization plateaus at @xmath4 , 1/3 , 1/5 and 1/7 of the saturated spin magnetization .",
    "the ground states corresponding to these magnetization plateaus have the same structure consisting of parallel antiferromagnetic bands of width @xmath67 , 2 , 4 and 6 separated by ferromagnetic stripes .",
    "these results indicate that the electron subsystem and its interaction with the spin subsystem can play the crucial role in the correct description of magnetization processes in rare - earth tetraborides . in our future work",
    "we plan to generalize this simple model by including the long - range interactions ( it was shown that such interactions suppress the stability of the 1/3 phase  @xcite ) and considering the heisenberg spins instead of the ising ones .",
