    "there is strong evidence for the mixing of muon neutrinos with another state , being either tau or sterile neutrinos .",
    "the evidence comes from atmospheric neutrino experiments which observe a decrease of muon neutrinos in charged current reactions , but no decrease of the corresponding electron neutrino interactions @xcite .    in order to obtain better insight into the oscillation which takes place and in order to eliminate dependence on the flux there are proposals and experiments being planned and constructed , which look at the neutral current interactions .",
    "these are reactions which will use neutrinos of an average energy of 1 gev producing the resonances between 1.0 and 1.6 gev / c@xmath0 .",
    "one proposal considers the production of pions directly by the atmospheric neutrinos @xcite and the detection of @xmath1 s with the help of two ring events .",
    "this method is limited by the low flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "more powerful are experiments which use neutrinos from an accelerator with two detectors ; the first one nearby the accelerator and a second further away .",
    "the nearby detector will be able to detect all pions and check the flux , as well as the cross - sections for these reactions .",
    "the detector with the long - baseline ( 300 - 400 km ) will observe the charged and neutral current reactions .",
    "we classify the reactions .",
    "quasi - elastic scattering @xmath2 is well understood .",
    "the oscillation of muon neutrinos into other neutrinos , tau or sterile , will produce a reduction of muon events in the far away detector .",
    "in addition to the above reaction there are excitations of resonances and their subsequent decays @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    furthermore , there are the neutral current reactions @xmath6 @xmath7",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9    the theory for the production of these states is known for thirty years now and there are several calculations available .",
    "the charged current reactions have been studied extensively @xcite and the production of the @xmath10 has been understood theoretically .",
    "it has also been measured experimentally with good agreement between theory and experiments . for the other charged current reactions",
    "there are few experimental measurements .",
    "for this reason the nearby detectors of the experiments should study the reactions using light and heavy nuclei as targets .",
    "knowledge of the neutral current reactions is even more limited .",
    "two of the latest calculations of charged and neutral current reactions for the production of single - pion cross sections differ by approximately @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one should make all possible efforts now to reduce the overall uncertainty and measure the various channels experimentally .",
    "a second difficulty arises from the fact that the experimental targets are heavy materials so that the interactions take place on protons and neutrons bound in nuclei like for example @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 . in the heavy nuclei , the produced pions rescatter before they exit from the nucleus and are subject to two phenomena : ( 1 )",
    "the cross - sections are reduced by the pauli exclusion principle , when the energy of the recoiling nucleon is low and can not occupy a filled level of nucleons , and ( 2 ) the pion charge exchange due to rescattering .",
    "these phenomena are known and have been the subject of extensive studies @xcite .",
    "the expectations of the experiments are the following . for all charge",
    "current reactions we expect a reduction of the observed rates in the far away detector because some of the muon neutrinos oscillated into another state . for the neutral current reactions we expect no reduction in rate if the oscillation is to tau neutrino because all neutrinos contribute equally to neutral current reactions .",
    "we expect a reduction if the oscillation is to sterile neutrinos .",
    "now , since the reduction is expected to be approximately @xmath15 , it is important to understand all possible corrections .",
    "an important requirement is that the nearby and the far away detector use the same nuclei as targets . in case",
    "this is not possible , then corrections will have to be applied .    because of the importance of the experiments and the opportunities they present for establishing the charged and neutral current reactions , we have undertaken the task of calculating the cross - section on free protons and neutrons .",
    "this way we produce differential , as well as integrated cross - sections .",
    "then we use the obtained results to calculate the corrections which are present in the nuclei .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : section 2 is devoted to the calculation of the differential and total cross - sections for single - pion production in neutrino - nucleon interactions . in section 3",
    "we discuss the nuclear effects involved in this process and calculate the energy spectra for charged and neutral pions for a few different materials typically used as targets in the experiments .",
    "finally , results and conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "in this section we present the main equations and the form factors used to evaluate the differential and total cross sections for single - pion production in neutrino - nucleon interactions . for neutrino energies of a few gev the single - pion production proceeds mainly through the excitation of the lower resonances . the main contribution to",
    "the cross section comes from the production and the subsequent decay of the @xmath16(1232)p@xmath17 resonance .",
    "nevertheless , some of the channels receive a non negligible contribution from the isospin 1/2 resonances as , for example , the n(1440)p@xmath18 and the n(1535)s@xmath18 resonances .",
    "the channels under investigation in this paper are the three charged current and the four neutral current channels listed in the introduction in eq . 1.1 to 1.7 .    using clebsh - gordan coefficient , it is easy to verify that the amplitudes for these seven channels are given by the following equations : @xmath19 where , in this paper , @xmath20 corresponds to the amplitude for the production of the p@xmath17 resonance , @xmath21 is the sum of the amplitudes for the production of the p@xmath18 and s@xmath18 resonances and @xmath22 is the sum of the isoscalar contributions of the p@xmath18 and s@xmath18 resonances to the cross section .",
    "notice that , as suggested in ref.@xcite , the neutral current amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 can be derived from the corresponding charged current amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 by simply rescaling the vector and axial form factors . in the case of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 amplitudes the vector and axial charged current form factors need to be multiplied by @xmath27 and by @xmath28 respectively , where @xmath29 is the weak mixing angle . for the @xmath22 instead",
    "the vector and axial charged current form factors need to be multiplied respectively by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , we want to point out that , since the @xmath22 amplitude turned out to be very small compared to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we neglected the isoscalar contribution in our evaluation of the cross sections .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the theory for the production of the @xmath16(1232)p@xmath17 is well known and understood , and several independent calculations have already been published , showing good agreement with the experimental results @xcite . therefore , rather than developing our own formalism for this process , we decided to follow the article of schreiner and von hippel in ref.@xcite .",
    "the fully differential cross section @xmath32 from ref.@xcite has been integrated over the polar angle @xmath33 and converted into the triple - differential cross section @xmath34 by using the fact that @xmath35 , where the superscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote quantities measured in the laboratory and in the center of mass frame respectively .",
    "the total cross section has been obtained by integrating over the allowed range of values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a cut on the invariant mass @xmath40 range at 1.6 gev .",
    "the axial and vector form factors used in this calculation are the ones given by alvarez - ruso et al . in eq .",
    "12 , 13 and 18 of ref.@xcite .",
    "notice that , since these form factors have been derived from photo- and electro - production experiments in which a @xmath41 or a @xmath42 was produced , in order to obtain the correct cross section for the @xmath10 production , all the form factors need to be multiplied by @xmath43 due to the fact that @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the triple - differential cross section @xmath34 for the production of the p@xmath18 and s@xmath18 resonances is given by the following equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the nucleon mass , @xmath47 is the fermi constant and @xmath48 is the difference between the energies of the incoming and the outgoing lepton .",
    "remembering that nearby the resonance only the s - channel is essential , the three matrix elements @xmath49 with @xmath50 can be defined as follow : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the coupling constant of the pion to the nucleon and the resonance , @xmath53 is the resonance mass , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the four - momenta of the initial and final nucleon respectively , q is the four - momentum transferred from the leptons to the hadrons and @xmath56 are the vector and axial form factors .",
    "the values for @xmath52 are given in eq .",
    "b7 and b10 in appendix b of ref.@xcite .",
    "the breit - wigner factor @xmath57 in eq.2.9 can be written in the following way : @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the width of the resonance .",
    "finally , the polarization vectors @xmath62 with @xmath63 used in eq.2.9 are defined as : @xmath64 for the form factors we use the expressions obtained by fogli and nardulli in ref.@xcite .    as in the case of the p@xmath17 resonance ,",
    "the total cross section has been obtained by integrating over the allowed range of values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a cut on the invariant mass @xmath40 range at 1.6 gev .      in this section",
    "we present our results for the total cross section for the seven channels under examination and , where possible , we compare these results with experimental data .    in fig.1 the total cross section for the @xmath65 process has been plotted versus the incoming neutrino energy .",
    "the data points have been taken from ref.@xcite ( solid circles ) and from ref.@xcite ( empty circles ) . as it can be seen , the agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data is quite good .",
    "fig.2 and fig.3 display the total cross sections for the @xmath66 and @xmath67 processes respectively , again plotted versus the incoming neutrino energy . in this case",
    "the data points have been taken from ref.@xcite ( solid circles ) , from ref.@xcite ( empty circles ) and from ref.@xcite ( crosses ) .",
    "also in this case the agreement between the theoretical results and the data points is reasonably good .",
    "the difference between the theoretical and the experimental results can be partially explained by taking into account the fact that , while the theoretical curves have been estimated imposing a cut on the invariant mass @xmath40 at 1.6 gev , the experimental points have been obtained without any cut .",
    "notice also that we did nt include any non - resonant background in our evaluation of the cross sections .    in the case of the neutral current interactions ,",
    "the experimental results are presented in the form of ratios between each of the neutral current channels and one of the charged current channels .",
    "for these reason , fig.4 , fig.5 , fig.6 and fig.7 , which display respectively the total cross sections of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 processes plotted versus the incoming energy , have no data points .",
    "nevertheless , we compared our results with the experimental ratios from ref.@xcite and found that there is a reasonable agreement , even if , in some cases , the ratios measured by the different experiments differ a lot one from the other .",
    "in section 2 we discussed the reaction @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a free nucleon ( proton or neutron ) . in order to investigate the nuclear effects taking place in the experimental targets ( for example , @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 )",
    ", we need to study the modifications necessary for the reaction @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the nuclear target and @xmath76 is an unobserved final nuclear state .",
    "we visualize the reaction as a two step process with the neutrino interacting with individual nucleons producing single pions and excited nuclei .",
    "the production process is influenced by the pauli principle and the fermi - motion of individual nucleons .",
    "the subsequent journey of the pions is a `` random - walk '' of multiple scattering until the pion escape from the nucleus . in the multiple scattering the pions",
    "can exchange their charge .",
    "these phenomena have been studied in the past @xcite and we shall adopt the formalism in order to calculate the energy spectra of the pions .",
    "we give enough details so that the reader has an overview of the model but for more details he or she should consult the original article .      following ref.@xcite , we treat the target as a collection of independent nucleons which are distributed in space accordingly to a density profile determined through electron - nucleus scattering experiments . for the charge density profile of @xmath12",
    "we adopt the harmonic oscillator model in which the density is given by : @xmath77 where @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 the root mean square radius .",
    "for @xmath13 and @xmath14 we use the two parameters fermi model and write the charge density in the following way : @xmath81    the different parameters used in eq.[3.1,3.2 ] are given in ref.@xcite and are summarized in table 1 .      in the first step the neutrinos",
    "interact with the bound protons and neutrons with these reactions allowed provided that the energy of the recoiling nucleon is above the fermi sea .",
    "this brings a correction factor calculated in @xcite . in the second step the pions rescatter several times",
    "until they reach the surface of the nucleus and escape .",
    "it is important to notice that the process taking place during the rescattering depend only on the properties of the target nucleus and are independent of the leptons involved in the first step .",
    "the differential cross sections for leptonic pion production on nuclear and on free nucleon targets are related to each other through the so called charge exchange matrix @xmath82 in the following way : @xmath83 where @xmath84    its eigenvalues define beams of pions of specific charge combination , which offer a scattering they produce a beam , which is decreased by the appropriate eigenvalue .",
    "the complete scattering phenomenon is characterized by three transition probabilities f(@xmath85 ) corresponding to the three eigenvalues .",
    "they describe the probabilities of beams with eigenvalues @xmath85 = 1 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 to survive and exit the nucleus .",
    "the `` random - walk '' of the pions is a stochastic process and several solutions were found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we collect here the main formulas for the calculation .",
    "when we transpose the final pion to the initial state , we obtain the system @xmath88 whose total isospin can be 0,1 and 2 .",
    "we use this property to parameterize the charge exchange matrix in terms of three functions a , c and d @xmath89 the overall factor a is given by @xmath90 with g(w,@xmath38 ) being the pauli suppression factor and f(1 ) the transmission coefficient for the state with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "the others two functions are @xmath91 @xmath92    as mentioned already f(@xmath85 ) contains the dynamics of the multiple scattering for the @xmath85 eigenvalues .",
    "both the pauli factor and several models f(@xmath85 ) were presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was also shown that approximating the multiple - scattering with scatterings in the forward and backward directions provides a very accurate approximation .",
    "thus what is important is the effective profile of the nucleus that the pions sea .",
    "this allows one to write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the impact parameter and the effective length @xmath95 is given by : @xmath96 in the case of @xmath12 , the effective length @xmath95 is given by : @xmath97 while for @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath95 is written as : @xmath98 the appropriate expression for the function @xmath99 has been derived in ref.@xcite both for the case of a one - dimensional multiple scattering problem and for the case of a spherical one .",
    "the two solutions have then been compared showing excellent agreement over the entire range of parameters .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we adopted for @xmath99 the approximate expression obtained in ref.@xcite for the one - dimensional problem .",
    "it is important to notice that , while the pauli production factor depends on both @xmath40 and @xmath38 , the function @xmath100 depends only on w and this dependence is very weak .",
    "therefore , as it has been already verified in ref.@xcite , it is reasonable to average the charge exchange parameters over the leading @xmath40-dependence by defining an averaged function @xmath101 in the following way : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the pion - nucleon scattering cross section and @xmath104 is the pion momentum .",
    "for the definitions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 see appendix c of ref.@xcite .      using the model outlined in the previous subsections",
    ", we evaluated the nuclear corrections for leptonic pion production on three different nuclei : oxygen , argon and iron .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath100 and for @xmath105 for the three different targets under consideration are listed in table ii and table iii , respectively .",
    "notice that , as table iii shows , the reduction of the cross section due to pauli exclusion principle is larger for smaller values of @xmath38 and it does not depend on the material .",
    "the charge exchange matrices m for oxygen , argon and iron are given by : @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108    the pauli factor and the charge exchange matrix m for oxygen have been compared with the corresponding quantities previously evaluated in ref.@xcite and have found to be in good agreement with each other .",
    "unfortunately , no comparison with previous calculation or experimental data is possible for argon and iron .",
    "the differential cross sections evaluated in sect . 2 for free nucleon targets have been used here together with the charge exchange matrix @xmath82 to obtain the differential cross sections for nuclear targets .",
    "these cross sections have been integrated over @xmath40 and @xmath38 keeping the neutrino energy fix at 1 gev in order to obtain the pion energy spectra appearing in fig.[8 - 16 ] .",
    "fig.[8 - 10 ] display respectively the pion energy distributions for positive , neutral and negative pions produced on oxygen targets . in each figure",
    "the solid line represent the initial distribution without any nuclear correction , the dashed line represents the same distribution after the application of the pauli factor in the production , and the dotted line represents the final distribution after applying all the nuclear corrections discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "similarly , fig.[11 - 13 ] and fig.[14 - 16 ] display the corresponding pion distributions produced on argon and iron targets , respectively .    from these figures",
    "it is clear that , while the reduction of the cross section due to the pauli production factor is the same for all the processes investigated in this paper , the nuclear corrections related to the pion charge exchange and pion absorption are larger for neutral pions than for the positive or negative ones .",
    "furthermore , these corrections turn out to be larger for heavier nuclei .",
    "finally , the magnitude of the nuclear corrections decreases with increasing pion energy .",
    "at least three long - baseline neutrino experiments plan to study low energy neutrino reactions .",
    "their main aim is the observation and better understanding of the neutrino - oscillations , but a necessary input is the understanding of these reactions in free protons and neutrons , as well as the modifications brought about when the nucleons are bound in relatively heavy nuclei .    in order to work in a coherent framework we calculated the cross sections on free protons and neutrons .",
    "the theory for the production of the @xmath16(1232)p@xmath17 resonance is well understood and our results for the total cross section agree with the experimental data .",
    "the same holds for other channels where i=1/2 resonances also contribute .",
    "the comparisons appear in figures 1 - 3 , where it is evident that the accuracy of the measurements is subject to large improvements .",
    "thus it is highly desirable that the new experiments use the nearby detector in order to measure the various cross sections .",
    "this refers to charged and neutral currents interactions on free protons and neutrons .",
    "the main uncertainties on this part of the paper are the functional form and parameters of the form factors and interference between i=3/2 and i=1/2 resonances .",
    "we expect that the effects from these uncertainties are small .",
    "more important are changes which are brought about in the scattering of neutrinos in heavy nuclei .",
    "it is very likely that the far away detectors will use heavy materials as targets in order to enhance their counting rates .",
    "the heavy materials bring in corrections comparable to oscillations .",
    "in this article we used an old model for nuclear corrections @xcite and calculated the effects on the produced @xmath109 . in section 3",
    "we reviewed the main features of the model so that the interested reader can reproduce the results .",
    "we decided that an interesting and important parameter in the experiments is the energy of the emerging pion .",
    "we calculated in figures 8 - 16 the pion spectra as function of their energy .",
    "we found that the largest correction appears in the spectrum of the @xmath110 s .",
    "the reduction of the signal for neutral pions with energies approximately 200 mev is substantial : of the order of 40@xmath111 .",
    "processes with nuclear corrections as large as the ones found in this article require special attention .",
    "several strategies suggest themselves .",
    "one is to use the same material for the front and the far away detector and study the spectra as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "then compare the results from the two detectors and with quasi elastic scattering . in case that the experiments are forced to use different materials detailed calculations for the two materials will point to similarities and possible differences between the two targets .    in the progress of this work we profited from the expertise of our colleagues .",
