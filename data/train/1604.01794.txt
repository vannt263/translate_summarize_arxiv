    "given a fluid velocity field @xmath1 , a passive tracer satisfies the linear advection equation @xmath2 where the scalar field @xmath3 denotes the concentration of the tracer at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 is its initial concentration at time @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that laminar unsteady velocity fields can , over time , develop complex tracer patterns consisting of ever smaller scales .",
    "this observation has inspired the successful development of many stirring protocols to enhance mixing in engineered devices ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "systematic classification of mixing efficiency of fluid flow , however , is relatively recent .",
    "this classification was initiated by  @xcite who derived rigorous bounds on the mixing efficiency of velocity fields with a prescribed stirring energy or stirring power budget .",
    "a notable outcome of their program is the rather remarkable discovery of a finite - energy velocity field ( @xmath7 ) that achieves perfect mixing in finite time  @xcite .",
    "it was shown later , however , that any such velocity field must have infinite viscous dissipation , i.e. @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "besides this fundamental limitation , the implementation of mathematically obtained optimal stirring strategies in a mixing device is not always feasible due to , for instance , geometric constraints .",
    "the problem is more acute in natural fluid flow ( such as geophysical flows or the blood stream ) over which we have virtually no control . in light of the above discussion",
    ", the natural question is :    \\(q ) _ given an unsteady velocity field , what is the optimal initial tracer pattern that leads to the most homogeneous mixture after a prescribed finite time ?",
    "_    in spite of its importance , this question has received relatively little attention .",
    "@xcite carried out a case study where the effect of the tracer injection location in a kenics mixer is examined .",
    "they find that , at least for short time horizons , the mixing efficiency depends significantly on the injection location .",
    "a similar case study is carried out by @xcite who studied the mixing efficiency of five different initial tracer patterns in a two - dimensional nonlinear model , known as the sine flow .",
    "@xcite addressed an analogous question : the asymptotic mixing of passive tracers advected under a steady velocity field where the tracer is injected continuously into the flow via source terms . through a variational approach , they determined the optimal distribution of the sources ( also see  @xcite , for related numerical results ) .    here",
    ", we address the finite - time mixing of passive tracers advected by fully unsteady velocity fields , as formulated in  .",
    "specifically , we seek the optimal initial condition @xmath5 that leads to the most homogeneous mixture after a given finite time . to the best of our knowledge , a rigorous method for determining this optimal initial condition is missing .",
    "problem ( q ) can , in principle , be formulated and solved as an infinite - dimensional optimization problem , where the optimal initial condition coincides with the minimizer of an appropriate cost functional .",
    "such minimizers are typically obtained by iterative methods of adjoint - based optimization  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , computationally prohibitive since it requires the backward - time integration of an adjoint partial differential equation ( pde ) at each iteration .    here",
    ", we show that under reasonable assumptions , the problem reduces to a finite - dimensional one that can be readily solved at a relatively low computational cost . to obtain this finite - dimensional reduction",
    ", we assume that tracer blobs smaller than a small , prescribed length - scale @xmath0 are considered completely mixed for all practical purposes .",
    "this assumption , that is made precise in section  [ sec : theory ] , results in a natural galerkin truncation of the perron ",
    "frobenius ( pf ) operator associated with the advection equation  .",
    "we show that the optimal initial condition @xmath5 then coincides with a singular vector of the truncated pf operator .",
    "our results complement the transfer operator - based methods for detecting finite - time coherent sets in unsteady fluid flows ( @xcite ; also see  @xcite ) .",
    "coherent sets refer to subsets of the fluid which exhibit minimal deformation under advection and therefore inhibit efficient mixing of tracers with the surrounding fluid .",
    "our aim here is the opposite , namely , initially large - scale structures that under advection deform mostly into small - scale filaments .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we introduce some basic notation and definitions .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] contains our main results and section  [ sec : numerics ] details their numerical implementation . in section  [ sec : results ] , the results are demonstrated on two examples .",
    "consider an unsteady , incompressible velocity field @xmath1 defined over a bounded open subset @xmath9 where @xmath10 or @xmath11 for two- and three - dimensional flows , respectively .",
    "the trajectories @xmath12 of the fluid particles satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath13 where @xmath12 denotes the time@xmath4 position of the particle starting from the initial position @xmath14 at time @xmath6 .",
    "if the velocity field is sufficiently smooth , there exists a two - parameter family of homeomorphisms @xmath15 ( the flow map ) such that @xmath16 for all times @xmath4 and @xmath17 . as our interest here is in finite - time mixing ,",
    "we restrict our attention to a prescribed finite time interval @xmath18 $ ] of interest .",
    "the flow map @xmath19 takes the initial position @xmath14 of a fluid particle at time @xmath6 to its final position at time @xmath20 .",
    "since the finite time interval is fixed , we drop the dependence of the flow map on @xmath6 and @xmath20 , and write @xmath21 for notational simplicity .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the concentration of a passive tracer , i.e. @xmath22 satisfies equation  .",
    "since the passive tracer is conserved along fluid trajectories , we have @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . note that since the flow map is a homeomorphisms , the inverse @xmath25 is well - defined .",
    "equation   motivates the definition of the perron - frobenius ( pf ) operator .",
    "the perron ",
    "frobenius operator associated with the flow map @xmath26 is the linear transformation @xmath27 such that , for all @xmath28 , @xmath29 [ def : pf ]    the evolution of passive tracers can be described by the action of the pf operator on their initial conditions .",
    "more specifically , for the passive tracer @xmath22 described above , we have @xmath30 for all @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "equation  ) .",
    "we point out that there is a more general definition of the pf operator applicable to non - invertible dynamics ( see definition 3.2.3 of  @xcite ) . in the special case where the flow map @xmath21 is invertible and volume - preserving ,",
    "the general definition is equivalent to definition  [ def : pf ] above ( corollary 3.2.1 in  @xcite ;  @xcite ) .    for incompressible flow ,",
    "the pf operator is a unitary transformation with respect to the @xmath32 inner product @xmath33 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath34-norm @xmath35 of the tracer remains invariant under advection .",
    "furthermore , the spatial average of the tracer is an invariant . without loss of generality",
    ", one can assume that this spatial average vanishes , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "there has been several attempts to detect coherent structures in unsteady fluid flows using approximations of the pf operator  @xcite .",
    "@xcite puts these approaches on a mathematically rigorous basis by composing the pf operator with diffusion operators .",
    "the resulting diffusive pf operator is compact and has a well - defined singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",
    "@xcite shows that a singular vector , corresponding to the largest non - unit singular value of the diffusive pf operator , can reveal minimally dispersive subsets of the fluid that remain coherent and thereby inhibit mixing ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "our goal here , however , is the opposite as we seek passive tracer initial conditions that mix most efficiently with their surrounding fluid .",
    "given an initial tracer distribution , a reasonable mixer will generically deform the tracer through stretching and folding of material elements such that , over time , it develops ever smaller length scales .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to release the tracer initially into smallest possible scales . in practice ,",
    "the initially available range of scales into which the tracer may be released is limited to relatively large scales .",
    "we denote this large length - scale limit by @xmath37 ( see figure  [ fig : schem_scales ] , for an illustration ) .",
    "it is left then to the fluid flow to transform the initially large - scale blobs of tracer to small filaments through a stretch - and - fold mechanism .    ) and the mixed scales ( smaller than @xmath0 ) . ]    on the other hand , we assume that there is a small length scale threshold @xmath38 , under which the tracer is considered , for all practical purposes , completely mixed .",
    "an efficient mixer , therefore , transfers the tracer distribution from large , initially available scales @xmath39 to the mixed scales @xmath40 . in the next section",
    ", we make these statements precise .",
    "we consider a set of functions @xmath41 forming a complete , orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable functions @xmath32 .",
    "that is @xmath42 and for any @xmath43 there are constants @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",

    "in other words , the length scale associated with the function @xmath47 decreases as @xmath49 increases .",
    "such a basis can be taken , for instance , to be fourier modes or wavelets  @xcite .    with this basis",
    ", we can mathematically model the subspace of initial conditions @xmath50 .",
    "the subspace @xmath50 consists of all scalar functions @xmath5 whose smallest length scale is larger than or equal to @xmath37 .",
    "since the basis @xmath41 is ordered , there is a positive integers @xmath51 such that @xmath52    the subspace of unmixed length scales @xmath53 can be modeled similarly using a basis @xmath54 for @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that this basis is also orthonormal , complete and associated with a decreasing sequence of length scales .",
    "the subspace @xmath53 consists of all scalar functions whose smallest length scale is larger than or equal to the unmixed length scale @xmath0 . therefore , there is @xmath55 such that @xmath56 note that the bases @xmath54 and @xmath57 can be taken to be identical , but this is not necessary here .",
    "we denote the orthogonal complement of @xmath53 by @xmath58 . in terms of the basis functions , we have @xmath59 where the overline denotes closure in the @xmath34 topology .",
    "the space @xmath58 consists of functions that only contain the mixed scales , that is scales smaller than @xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig : schem_scales ] ) .      given an initial condition @xmath60 for the tracer , its advected image @xmath61 at the final time can potentially contain all length scales @xmath46 .",
    "the flow redistributes the ` energy ' budget of the tracer among various scales in such a way that the @xmath34-norm is conserved , i.e. , @xmath62 a tracer is better mixed if more of its energy budget is transfered to the mixed scales @xmath63 . therefore , we seek optimal initial conditions @xmath60 such that the energy budget of its image @xmath64 is mostly stored in the mixed scales , maximizing @xmath65 . to make these statements more precise",
    "we introduce the following truncation of the pf operator .",
    "we define the truncated pf operator @xmath66 as the linear map @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the orthogonal projection onto the @xmath69-dimensional subspace @xmath53 .",

    "consider the function spaces @xmath50 and @xmath53 and their associated truncated pf operator defined above .",
    "the solution of @xmath86 with the maximum taken over all @xmath60 with @xmath87 , is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a right singular vector of the truncated pf matrix   corresponding to its smallest singular value .",

    "such initial conditions result in ` perfect mixing ' since their advected image @xmath102 belongs entirely to the mixed scales @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath103 . in the examples studied in section  [ sec : results ] , such perfect finite - time mixing was not observed . in other words ,",
    "the matrices @xmath80 are full - rank in these examples .",
    "we emphasize that the truncated pf operator @xmath75 is _ not _ used as an approximation of the full pf operator @xmath104 . instead ,",
    "the truncation @xmath75 followed naturally from the physical assumption that length scales @xmath40 are completely mixed .",
    "as is clear from equation  , to evaluate the truncation @xmath75 , one still needs to utilize the full pf operator to evaluate the terms @xmath105 .",
    "numerical computation of the optimal initial condition @xmath99 relies on the scale - dependent bases @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for completeness",
    ", we discuss two such bases : the fourier basis and the haar wavelet basis . since the examples considered in section  [ sec : results ] below are defined on equilateral two - dimensional domains , @xmath108\\times [ 0,l]$ ] , we focus on this special case .",

    "while the above fourier basis is a convenient choice , it restricts its applicability to the periodic boundary conditions .",
