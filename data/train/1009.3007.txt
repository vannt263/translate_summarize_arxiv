    "statistical mechanics ( sm ) provides useful concepts to study systems with large number of particles .",
    "for example , based on standard sm , edwards @xcite proposed a thermodynamic description of granular matter in which thermodynamic quantities are computed as flat averages over configurations where the grains are static or jammed , leading to a definition of configurational temperature .",
    "a numerical diffusion - mobility experiment of a granular system has supported the edwards statistical ensemble idea @xcite .",
    "another example is the relation between entropy and the horizon area of a black hole @xcite , which provides a new approach for studying black holes and quantum gravity theory .",
    "furthermore , four laws of black hole mechanics can be demonstrated using this thermodynamic description .",
    "the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy , originally calculated thermodynamically , has been explained from string theory .",
    "@xcite    recently , cejnar et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed quantum phase transitions in finite systems @xcite by defining an analog of the absolute temperature scale connected to the interaction parameter of the hamiltonian . and",
    "thus , they were capable of establishing a thermodynamic analogy for the quantum phase transition .",
    "however , they did not identify the correspondence with statistical mechanics and consequently the new scenario opened by this microscopic analysis .",
    "this correspondence and these consequences are the goal of this paper .    here , we use tools developed in sm to study the ground - state of quantum systems . we observe that , for certain classes of quantum systems , taking different intensities of the interaction between particles of the system corresponds to taking different occupation probabilities for non - interacting microstates energy levels",
    ". with this observation we can define an analog of the absolute temperature scale in such a manner that it is possible to make a thermodynamic interpretation for the interaction in the ground - state of quantum systems .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is a typical model in which this approach can be applied . here ,",
    "we analyze two exact solvable limits of the hubbard model .",
    "this paper is organized as follow .",
    "the formalism is described in sec .",
    "the study of the two exact solvable problems based on the hubbard model are presented in sec .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the scheme of our formalism can be applied to a broad class of hamiltonians defined as @xmath0 where we assume that @xmath1 is a one - particle hamiltonian operator and the interaction term is given by the @xmath2 operator and @xmath3 is the dimensionless interaction parameter . here",
    ", we must consider that @xmath4 and the operator @xmath2 is positively defined . in this way we have established that the energy is a concave function of @xmath3    a good example of this class of hamiltonians is the one of the hubbard model @xcite . in this model , which is amongst the most important magnetic ones , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the absence of interaction ( @xmath5 ) are just the non - interacting states @xmath6 , whose respective energy eigenvalues , @xmath7 are defined through the relation @xmath8 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath9 of @xmath10 for nonvanishing @xmath3 are obtained from the equation @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the expectation value of an operator @xmath12 on the ground - state @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "now , we can provide a approach for obtaining expectation values of physical quantities on the ground - state in the base of non - interacting states .",
    "this simply means to find the expectation values of @xmath12 on the ground - state in the @xmath6 representation .",
    "the ground - state @xmath15 can be expanded in terms of the non - interacting states @xmath6 as @xmath16 where the coefficients @xmath17 .",
    "we recall that the quantity @xmath18 has a _",
    "probabilistic _ interpretation .",
    "in other words , we can write @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 . this establishes the connection to sm : the expectation value of @xmath1 , @xmath21 can be interpreted as a usual average , which is computed over the set of non - interacting energy levels @xmath22 , each one with probability @xmath23 .",
    "it is an analog of the mean energy @xmath24 .",
    "we can easily verify that if @xmath4 and @xmath25 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath3 , then @xmath26 for @xmath27 . in this case , in analogy to sm , for the non - interacting case @xmath5 , the system has the lowest energy @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 , like a thermal energy , the interaction favors other energy levels of the non - interacting case . in this description , only the non - interacting microscopic states are used to compute the _ thermodynamic _ properties .",
    "this enables us to define an analog of the absolute temperature scale , called ground - state temperature , as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant measured in kelvins@xmath33 .",
    "this description is illustrated in fig .",
    "similar to the usual canonical ensemble of the sm , we can consider that taking different ground - state temperatures @xmath34 , i.e , different values of the interaction parameter , the particles of the system fall into non - interacting microstates , corresponding to different occupation probabilities for these energy levels .",
    "( interaction parameter ) , the particles of the system fall into non - interacting microstates , corresponding to different occupation probabilities for these energy levels.,width=321 ]    in addition , an analogy to the standard thermodynamics is also reproduced by this description .",
    "we can introduce a so - called ground - state thermodynamics , defining the ground - state internal energy , ground - state free energy and ground - state entropy , respectively , as @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    it can be easily seen that @xmath38 is a non - negative monotonically increasing function of @xmath34 .",
    "we can trivially verify that , using eqs .",
    "( [ ug])-([sg ] ) , the ground - state thermodynamics precisely satisfies the standard thermodynamics relation for the helmholtz free energy @xmath39 furthermore , we can derive the thermal response function , in correspondence to the heat capacity @xmath40 it is interesting to observe that the expression above can be calculated using the hellmann - feynman theorem which allows to find the ground - state expectation values of a general operator @xmath12 by differentiating the ground state energy of a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "for illustrating the approach introduced in this letter , let us study two exact solvable problems based on the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the creation , annihilation and number operators for an electron with spin @xmath47 in an orbital localized at site @xmath48 on a lattice of @xmath49 sites ; the @xmath50 denotes pairs @xmath51 of nearest - neighbor sites on the lattice ; @xmath52 is the coulombian repulsion that operates when the two electrons occupy the same site ; and @xmath53 is the electron transfer integral connecting states localized on nearest - neighbor sites . first and second terms of eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) correspond to , respectively , one - particle @xmath1 and interaction terms of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the problem of two electrons in two sites is the simplest example to our approach . by using direct calculus , it is easy to obtain the ground - state eigenvalue and eigenfunction , respectively , as @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 are eigenfunctions for the case @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 thus , we define @xmath60 , and using eqs .",
    "( [ ug])-([sg ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ gs2s ] ) and ( [ es2s ] ) , we find ( from now @xmath61 and @xmath62 for simplicity ) @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 figure [ fi2 ] shows curves ( full lines ) of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 versus the temperature @xmath71 for the expression above representing the case of two electrons on two sites for the hubbard model . as clearly seen in these figures , the behavior of these new variables is exactly as expected from the usual thermodynamics .",
    "now , let us consider the functional dependence for the entropy given by eq .",
    "( [ s2s ] ) in terms of the occupation probability of the non - interacting quantum states . using the energetic constraint ( eq .",
    "( [ ug ] ) ) , this dependence generates the concept of thermostat temperature , if we focus on the canonical ensemble of the sm formalism .",
    "it is easy to show from eqs .",
    "( [ es2s])-([as2s ] ) that the occupation probabilities for the eigenfunctions @xmath72 of the non - interacting case are @xmath73 we straightforwardly obtain the entropic form @xmath74 which is a concave function representing the geometric average of the quantum states probability , where certainty corresponds to @xmath75 . here",
    ", we can see the difference between the standard sm and the ground - state sm . for the standard sm we always use the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath76 , while for the ground - state sm",
    ", this universality is broken , and the form of the entropy depends on the particular quantum system . on the other hand , this issue does not rule out the possibility that many different systems fall into some basic classes exhibiting qualitatively similar behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fi3 ] , we show the functional forms of the entropies associated with the boltzmann - gibbs and with eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) assuming 2 states .    in what follows",
    ", we shall illustrate the above procedure by addressing the exact solution for the half - filled band of the hubbard model for the one - dimensional case in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this famous solution was obtained by lieb and wu in the sixties @xcite using the bethe anzatz . since then , this result is considered one of the most important ones , owing to the lack of exact solution for the hubbard model .",

    "these curves correspond to the dotted lines and , as well noticed from the case of two electrons , they are also expected from the usual thermodynamics .",
    "in summary , we introduce an approach to solve problems of quantum mechanics using concepts of statistical mechanics",
    ". we can consider that taking different ground - state temperatures @xmath34 , i.e , different values of the interaction parameter , the particles of the system fall into non - interacting microstates , corresponding to different occupation probabilities for these energy levels .",
    "we found that the functional form of the ground - state entropy depends on the particular quantum system .",
    "the break down of universality of the entropy is consistent with the concept of generalized entropies @xcite associated with a specific quantum hamiltonian .",
    "finally , the ideas presented here can eventually provide a mechanism for new approximation methods , such as the usage of the geometric average of the quantum states probability in the high dimensional limit for the hubbard model .",
    "we can envisage in further works the study of the possibility that many different systems may fall into some basic classes of the ground - state entropy .",
