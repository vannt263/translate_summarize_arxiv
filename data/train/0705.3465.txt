    "this is because it is not clear _ a  priori _ how efficiently universal preheating will smooth the gas distribution prior to cluster collapse . in this work",

    "these were calculated according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the thompson cross section , @xmath36 is the mass of the electron , @xmath37 , is the speed of light , @xmath38 is the electron pressure , and @xmath39 is the line element along the line of sight through the cluster center , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the boltzmann and planck constants respectively , @xmath43 @xcite is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature , and the integral is performed over a spherical volume out to @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we calculated the gas  weighted entropy profile , where entropy was defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average number density of electrons in a given shell , again assuming a fully ionized plasma .",
    "our analytic model follows the techniques of @xcite and @xcite . given an initial , unmodified , spherically symmetric model in hydrostatic equilibrium , then entropy profile is `` modified ''  in this case with a simple shift at all radii  and the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are re  integrated , yielding a final `` modified '' gas and temperature distribution . therefore ,",

    "furthermore , motivated in part by the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , we include @xmath52 in ( [ eq : hydro ] ) to allow for departures from strict hydrostatic equilibrium , in which the gas is supported by a combination of gas pressure and turbulent motions .",
    "the gravitational potential of the dark matter ( dm ) follows a @xcite ( nfw ) profile , as motivated by n - body simulations , with a fixed concentration parameter @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "finally , both the modified and unmodified models satisfy the same outer boundary condition , which is chosen to match the simulation results , but is related to the pressure required to resist the infall of baryonic matter at the viriol radius @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the cosmic baryon baryon fraction .",
    "the entropy floor is approximated by a shift in the entropy profile defined by : @xmath56 as discussed in @xcite , this shift is a simple phenomenological approximation of a uniform , highredshift preheating .",
    "in particular it assumes that mass shells remain in the same order after the modification ( this is reasonable due to that fact that entropy must be monotonically increasing for stability reasons ) , and that the effect of preheating is to increase the entropy by the fixed , stated amount even after passing through the shock . @xcite examined this issue and found that this simple shift was a reasonable approximation ( to within 20% ) for smooth accretion .",
    "of course , in a full cosmological simulation , the accretion is not generally smooth ; however , as we will show , the shift approximation works remarkably well .      for our comparison to be self ",
    "consistent , the most important consideration was our choice of unmodified distribution",
    ". this must match the results of the no  preheating simulation as closely as possible ; for if our unmodified model does not match the simulations without preheating , we have no reason to expect that modifications to that model will be consistent either .",
    "we therefore attempted the match the median entropy profile in two mass bins : low ( @xmath57 ) and moderate ( @xmath58 ) mass clusters .",
    "all of the model predictions were made at the median mass in each bin ; @xmath59 and @xmath60  in the low and moderate mass bins respectively . a summary of all the models considered is shown in figure  [ fig : unmodified ] .",
    "we first consider a set of _ ab  initio _ unmodified models . our first choice was similar to the fiducial model of @xcite and @xcite , in which the unmodified gas distribution is taken to follow the nfw dark matter density profile at the cosmic baryon density in strict hydrostatic equillibrium ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "although it roughly reproduces the profile , in detail this nfw gas entropy profile was both too steep and incorrectly normalized , predicting a higher entropy for @xmath62 than was seen in the simulations .",
    "it furthermore did not reproduce the core entropy seen in simulations , due to the divergent nfw density at small radii . allowing @xmath63 to vary produced somewhat better agreement in the normalization and slope , but still predicted identically zero core entroy .",
    "we then tried a set of alternative models in an attempt to reproduce the core entropy see in the simulations : isothermal and a gas distribution with a flat core .",
    "isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with @xmath64 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also had incorrect slope and normalization , with a core entropy that was too low .",
    "we then tried keeping the gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , but modifying the gas distribution such that @xmath65 .",
    "this too , did not fit the simulations , requiring a divergent temperature at the cluster center and a non  monotonically increasing entropy profile , both of which were unphysical .    since reproducing this median entropy profile from the no  preheating simulations with",
    "models yielded no success , we instead chose to use a fit to the median entropy profile in the amr simulations of @xcite .",
    "we parameterized the entropy profile in terms of @xmath66 , the enclosed gas fraction , with the following fit : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , following the definitions in @xcite .",
    "we chose the outer boundary condition , once again based on the simulations , to be given by @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite showed that the entropy profiles in sph and amr simulations agree very well outside of @xmath71 while inside this radius , the sph simulations show steeper entropy profiles with lower ( but non - zero ) core entropies .",
    "the source of this discrepancy is not clear , although the new entropy conserving version of gadget2 @xcite does show higher entropy cores ( g. yepes , private communication ) . in any case , the size of the difference at @xmath72 is quite small , about 25% and certainly not enough to resolve the discrepancy with observations discussed in section  [ sec : obs ] .    finally , we note that our simulated clusters were not in strict hydrostatic equilibrium ( see figure  [ fig : hydro ] ) , a result which is consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "the result of this was that even with our fitted entropy profiles , we could not reproduce the simulated density and temperature profiles in detail for @xmath73 .",
    "we found that setting @xmath63 to 0.8 , as suggested by the median profiles in figure  [ fig : hydro ] ( and previous work ) generated a good fit to the gas profiles over a wide range of masses .",
    "having found a reasonable entropy profile within our unmodified model , we then modied these profiles according to the prescription in @xcite and @xcite and computed the resulting model predictions for gas density , temperature , and entropy profiles in the same mass bins using matching entropy shifts of @xmath19 ( no preheating ) , 78 , 155 , and 200 . in figure",
    "[ fig : profiles.model ] , we compare the model predictions to the simulation results for the gas density @xmath16 , gas  weighted temperature @xmath28 , and gas  weighted entropy @xmath74 profiles .",
    "this comparison is made for the median profile in both the low and moderate mass bins .",
    "we find remarkable agreement between our analytic predictions and the simulation results over both mass bins for all three entropy shifts .",
    "the temperature profiles are underpredicted by the model , but never by more than @xmath75 at @xmath76 , and never by more than @xmath77 out to @xmath32 .",
    "the entropy profile in the center is very well reproduced .",
    "there is also a tendency for the model to underpredict the entropy at @xmath78 compared to the simulations , although again never by more than about @xmath79 .",
    "we can therefore conclude , as one can see qualitatively in figure  [ fig : snapshot ] that preheating efficiently smoothes the accreted density distribution , making the accretion histories of our simulated clusters more smooth . as a result , shifting the unmodified entropy profile is a good approximation to the effects of preheating in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , we find that the model predictions and simulation results converge as @xmath13 increases .",
    "this occurs because as @xmath13 increases , the entropy input can effectively smooth larger and larger sub  haloes , and the simulations converge on the smooth accretion limit , making our modified models a better and better approximation .      from the comparison to the median profiles in figure  [ fig : profiles.model ] , we find both qualitative and quantitative agreement between the analytic predictions and the simulation results .",
    "this is very encouraging , however comparing the median profiles is only a snapshot of the behavior of the intracluster entropy for the median cluster profile in two mass bins .",
    "the model predictions for the intracluster entropy over a much broader mass range contain a great deal of addition information .    in figure",
    "[ fig : entropy.model ] , we show the entropy ",
    "mass scalings for two characteristic entropy measures used in observations : the `` core '' entropy , taken at @xmath80 ( lower panel , @xmath81 ) , and the `` outer '' entropy taken at @xmath82 ( upper panel , @xmath83 ) . for the core entropy ,",
    "our analytic predictions are again in remarkable agreement with the simulations .",
    "however at high mass @xmath84 , our analytic predictions are somewhat lower than the simulation results .",
    "this behavior is slightly enhanced for higher values of @xmath13 .",
    "conversely , the models somewhat underpredict the outer entropy at all masses , with the exception of the very highest mass clusters where small numbers of objects make the trend difficult to discern .",
    "the agreement we see for the entropy of the preheated models is of particular interest and somewhat surprising .",
    "the effects of preheating on the entropy of simulated clusters in the cosmological simulation represents contributions from two competing effects .",
    "entropy input into the icm will tend to push out the accretion shock , which will in turn decrease the efficiency of heating at the shock and decrease the core entropy @xcite .",
    "however , as first suggested by @xcite , preheating will also tend to lower the density of accreted haloes .",
    "this may affect a partial transition from lumpy to smooth accretion that will actually increase the efficiency of entropy generation at the accretion shock , and with it the entropy of the system .",
    "our simulations suggest that these competing effects tend to cancel each other out .    in order to extract only the effects of entropy input on the simulations",
    ", we match the halos in each simulation , and do a halo  by  halo comparison . for each cluster , we examine two ratios , or amplification factors : @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the gas  weighted average entropy @xmath88 at fixed gas fraction @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the entropy at fixed gas fraction @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the total enclosed gas mass at @xmath32 .",
    "we use @xmath93 to indicate the no  preheating case , and compute the ratio for each of the preheated simulations .",
    "these ratios represent the entropy offset between simulated clusters at fixed gas mass , in units of the entropy input @xmath13 , at fixed gas mass in both the core and outskirts .",
    "the results of this comparison are show in figure  [ fig : entropyamp ] , with @xmath94 or @xmath95 representing no entropy amplification , and larger values of @xmath96 implying more entropy amplification .",
    "we find only mild evidence of entropy amplification in figure  [ fig : entropyamp ] .",
    "the overall mean core and outer amplification factors for @xmath97 are @xmath98 and @xmath99 with associated variances @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the trend towards more amplification at lower masses for both amplification factors is qualitatively consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the mean amplitude of the amplification is @xmath102 for all values of @xmath13 , and within a wide scatter is consistent with unity .",
    "overall we find that on average , preheating does make entropy generation more efficient , but only by a small fraction .",
    "@xcite found amplification factors of @xmath103 and 1.84 at @xmath104 for a simulated group of mass @xmath105  using entropy floors of @xmath106 and 100 respectively .",
    "as noted above , we find smaller values for a much larger sample .",
    "one possible source of this discrepancy is the nature of the simulations : @xcite include the effects of heating / cooling from a uniform uv background , star formation from a multiphase interstellar medium , and galactic winds powered by supernova feedback , whereas our simulations use a simple implementation of preheating in which all of these processes are subsumed into the high redshift entropy modification .",
    "another possibility is the improved statistical power of our simulations , which model more objects than @xcite .",
    "although there are groups of comparable mass in our sample with amplification factors that are roughly consistent with the findings of @xcite , we also find that the mean amplification is within @xmath107 of unity , even for low  mass systems .",
    "however , perhaps the most likely explanation is the timing of the entropy input . in @xcite",
    ", the entropy was added much later , at @xmath108 , when many smaller halos would have already formed .",
    "the gas in these halos is at high density and so , for a fixed amount of entropy , receives much more energy .",
    "this may have lead to large - scale outflows and shocking , which , in turn , may have caused the entropy amplification . in the simulations discussed here , the input is done at much earlier times ( @xmath109 ) as in @xcite , because we want to isolate only the effects of preheating .",
    "we also find some evidence of turbulent mixing in the gas .",
    "this will will tend to equalize the entropy profile , raising the core and lowering the outer entropy .",
    "it has previously been noted that simulated clusters are not in strict hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite , probably due to turbulence @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : entropyamp ] exhibits two telling trends : the core amplification factor @xmath94 tends towards unity with higher entropy input @xmath13 , and the outer amplification factor @xmath110 tends toward entropy suppression ( @xmath111 ) in systems with @xmath112 .",
    "this is consistent with turbulent mixing , which will be less efficient at amplifying the core entropy at higher @xmath13 as smoothing suppresses the turbulence , and more efficient at suppressing the outer entropy at higher mass as more of the substructure is resolved and turbulence becomes more important .",
    "these two tends are , as we show in figure  [ fig : hydro ] , borne out in our simulations ; higher mass clusters with higher @xmath13 tend to have more support against gravity contributed by turbulent motions in the gas . however , though we see trends that suggest turbulent mixing , we concede that this is speculation and warrants a more in depth analysis , which we defer to future work .    therefore , our simulations show the combined effect of two processes that are difficult to disentangle .",
    "classic entropy amplification will tend to increase both the core and outer entropy , and will tend towards higher @xmath94 at lower mass .",
    "turbulent mixing will suppress the outer entropy , tending towards lower @xmath110 at higher mass , while simultaneously raising the core entropy more efficiently at higher @xmath13 .",
    "we see all of these trends in our data . as a result , while the magnitude of the amplification favors the more subtle effects of turbulent mixing , we can not firmly argue that either is dominant .",
    "nevertheless , as figure  [ fig : entropyamp ] makes clear , the size of either effect is not large .",
    "in addition to the entropy scalings , we compare the model predictions to the simulation results for several observationally motivitated scaling relations . in figure  [ fig : scaling.model ] , we present two scalings typically used by x  ray observers : the mass  temperature ( for @xmath25 ) , and temperature  luminosity ( for @xmath30 , the bolometric x  ray luminosity ) relations . in figures  [ fig : yc.model ] and [ fig : yint.model ] respectively , we present the mass and temperature scalings for two sz observables defined above : the central decrement @xmath31 and the fiads sz luminosity @xmath113 .    for the typical x ",
    "ray observables show in figure  [ fig : scaling.model ] , we again find remarkable agreement between our model and the simulations .",
    "this is due largely to the agreement between the predicted and simulated core density , as the x  ray emission scales as @xmath114 and is only weakly dependent on the temperature of the gas .",
    "furthermore , this agreement suggests that the scalings in figure  [ fig : scaling.model ] are largely insensitive to asymmetries in the simulations ; we find that our assumption of spherical symmetry is a good approximation to the simulation results .    in figures  [ fig : yc.model ] and",
    "[ fig : yint.model ] , we present the mass ( left panel ) and temperature ( right panel ) scaling of two typical sz observables .",
    "our analytic predictions are in good agreement with the simulation results for both scalings .",
    "we furthermore find that the central sz decrement , in both the model and simulations , to be a far better indicator of cluster temperature than mass .",
    "we also confirm previous studies , which found the fiads sz integrated luminosity to be a robust , low ",
    "scatter mass and temperature indicator with roughly self ",
    "similar scaling @xcite .",
    "this mass  fiads sz luminosity scaling is remarkably independent of the value of the entropy input @xmath13 , while the temperature scaling exhibits weak @xmath13 dependence .",
    "we have found very good agreement between our analytic model predictions and the simulation results for the median density , temperature , and entropy profiles , the core and outer entropy scalings , and six different observable scalings .",
    "it is important to note , however , that this agreement came in large part by imposing an unmodified entropy profile derived from the simulations .",
    "none of our _ ab  initio _ unmodified models were in agreement with the simulation results .",
    "in particular , even when the slope and normalization of the entropy profile were matched closely , as in the case of an nfw gas profile with @xmath115 ( see figure  [ fig : unmodified ] ) , there was poor agreement with the simulation results .",
    "this was true even of the scaling of integrated quantities such as the @xmath116 and @xmath117 relations , which were too steep and incorrectly normalized .",
    "at the same time , as the value of the entropy input @xmath13 was increased , we found improved agreement with the simulations .",
    "this convergence is consistent with what we showed explicitly earlier ; preheating efficiently smoothes the icm , and therefore a simple shift of the unmodified entropy profile is a good approximation for the effects of preheating @xcite . at the same time , an unmodified model with no core entropy was quantitatively and qualitatively at odds with simulation results , even when that unmodified entropy profile was a very good fit for @xmath118 . and , though the value of this core entropy can vary depending on the numerical technique used @xcite , it is essential in setting the thermodynamic state and structural properties of the icm .",
    "the importance of this non  zero core entropy has been previously downplayed @xcite , but here we find it to be a primary cause of disagreement between analytic model predictions and hydrodynamical simulations , even when the modification procedure is shown to be a good approximation .",
    "there has been some suggestion in the literature , motivated by recent observations , that preheating models which invoke a universal entropy floor are incorrect in detail @xcite . in particular , some authors have suggested that this brand of preheating predicts isentropic cores in low ",
    "mass systems that are not observed . in this section",
    ", we use the results of our simulations , which necessarily include all the relevant dynamical and geometric effects , as a test of the preheating scenario itself . towards this end , we compare our results to observations of x  ray scalings ( figure  [ fig : scaling.obs ] ) and both the core and outer entropy  temperature scalings ( figures  [ fig : outer.entropy.obs ] , [ fig : outer.entropy.obs2 ] , and [ fig : core.entropy.obs ] ) .",
    "j    in figure  [ fig : scaling.obs ] , we show the simulation results , along with best  fit power  laws , for the mass  temperature ( upper panel ) and temperature  luminosity ( lower panel ) scaling relations as compared to the observations of @xcite . as we mention above , the mass  temperature relation from the simulation is roughly independent of the value of the entropy input @xmath13 . and ,",
    "not surprisingly , with the exception of the no  preheating simulation all of the simulated mass  temperature relations are consistent with the observational data . the temperature  luminosity relation , on the other hand , is very sensitive to the entropy input , as the bolometric luminosity scales roughly as @xmath119 and preheating depresses and flattens the core density distribution .",
    "the temperature and luminosity are also both pure observables given a cosmological model  as opposed to @xmath25 which @xcite estimate using an isothermal @xmath120model @xcite  and therefore provide more robust constraints on @xmath13 .",
    "we find that an entropy input @xmath121 will best fit the observational data .",
    "figures  [ fig : outer.entropy.obs ] , [ fig : outer.entropy.obs2 ] , and [ fig : core.entropy.obs ] show the outer ( @xmath83 and @xmath122 ) and core ( @xmath123 ) entropy  temperature scaling from the simulations as compared to the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show the nearly isentropic cores in low ",
    "mass ( or temperature ) clusters : notice that the entropy is nearly mass  independent for low - mass clusters at the highest level of entropy input .",
    "in addition there is a break in the power - law scaling which shifts to higher mass with higher entropy input .",
    "we find that , while observations of the entropy at large radius in rich clusters are consistent our results , fully three  dimensional , non  radiative cosmological simulations of the preheating scenario of cluster formation are inconsistent with observations in several ways .",
    "first , the entropy input scaling suggested by the temperature  luminosity relation is clearly inconsistent with observations of the intracluster entropy ; simulations of the best fit @xmath13 range overproduce the core entropy and underproduce the outer entropy at fixed temperature .",

    "mass cores predicted by preheating as a function of @xmath13 , which are not observed .    as a caveat to our comparison to observations ,",
    "we note that there has been some suggestion , most notably by @xcite that observational studies of the entropy profiles of clusters have been biased towards low core entropy systems .",
    "this may , they argue , explain why some observations appear to be inconsistent with high levels of entropy input @xcite .",
    "however , while this is a possibility , we find dramatic and qualitative disagreement between the scalings in our simulations simulations and observations which would be difficult to reproduce with a low  core entropy selection bias .",
    "we furthermore find disagreement at large radius ( see figures  [ fig : outer.entropy.obs ] and [ fig : outer.entropy.obs2 ] ) , well outside the cool region .",
    "it is unlikely that a bias related to low entropy in the core would affect the outskirts .      as an aside",
    ", we briefly investigate the effects of radiative cooling .",
    "there has been some hope in the literature that the shortcomings of the preheating scenario will be solved by a combination of preheating and radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this is difficult to implement in a simulation because heating and cooling are probably strongly tied together ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we can imagine one simple and concrete extension to the straightforward preheating picture in which we include radiative cooling ( but not star formation or feedback ) at some late epoch , well after preheating has occurred .",
    "we therefore re  ran our @xmath124 simulation , including the effects of radiative cooling for @xmath125 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we find that although the core entropy is modified , the entropy at @xmath126 is relatively insensitive to cooling and so the basic results above do not change .",
    "this is , however , another topic worthy of much more thorough investigation .",
    "we present high  resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the preheating scenario of cluster formation , in which the effect of sn and/or agn heating is approximated as a universal increase of the entropy , implemented at high redshift .",
    "we focus on two aspects : ( 1 ) how well analytic models of entropy input reproduce the simulations results , and ( 2 ) how well the preheating simulations match current cluster observations .",
    "we find that analytic models of preheating following those of @xcite and @xcite are remarkably successful at reproducing the results of hydrodynamical simulations in detail .",
    "this agreement extends from scalings of integrated quantities such @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and sz scalings for @xmath31 and the fiads integrated sz luminosity , to core and outer entropy scalings , and finally to the median entropy , temperature , and density profiles of both low and moderate mass clusters .",
    "however , this agreement is dependent on the right choice of an unmodified profile ; in particular one with non ",
    "zero core entropy .",
    "when we look in detail at the simulation results , we do not find strong evidence for entropy amplification , the process in which the entropy is amplified even beyond the level injected @xcite .",
    "this differs from the results of @xcite , who looked at a small set of clusters and groups .",
    "the reasons for this are not entirely clear although their preheating model differed from that used here ( in particular the entropy input occured at a lower redshift ) .",
    "our simulations also show that the preheating scenario for cluster formation is in conflict with recent observations of the x  ray scalings @xcite and intracluster entropy @xcite . the best ",
    "fit value of the entropy input @xmath13 , determined from the x  ray scalings ( see figure  [ fig : scaling.obs ] ) , underproduces the entropy at @xmath126 and overproduces the entropy at @xmath127 at fixed temperature ( see figures  [ fig : outer.entropy.obs ] and [ fig : core.entropy.obs ] ) .",
    "no single value for the entropy input due to preheating can simultaneously match the observed entropy values at both the core _ and _ the outskirts .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of radiative cooling at late times ( without any additional feedback ) does not appear to change this result .",
    "therefore , we find this simple preheating scenario to be in disagreement with observations , implying that other , more sophisticated treatments are needed .",
