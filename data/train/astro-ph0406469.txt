    "recent discoveries of jupiter - like planets around solar - type stars have rejuvenated the interest in the issue of the origin of giant planets . core instability model ( perri & cameron 1974 ; harris 1978 ; mizuno 1980 ) in which jupiter - like planets acquire their massive gaseous atmospheres by unstable gas accretion onto the preexisting massive solid cores has been one of the most fruitful ideas in this field . for rather long time",
    "this avenue of planet formation did not seem compatible with the short observed lifetimes ( @xmath8 yr ) of protoplanetary disks because of the long time needed for the core accumulation .",
    "however , recent work by rafikov ( 2003 ) and goldreich ( 2004 ) has found core formation time to be actually quite short , essentially removing the timescale issue from the core instability scenario .",
    "nevertheless , gravitational instability ( hereafter gi ) in the protoplanetary disk ( cameron 1978 ; boss 1998 ) has been put forward as an alternative mechanism of giant planet formation . in this model massive gaseous disk",
    "becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly fragments into a number of self - gravitating bound structures , which further collapse to become giant planets .",
    "a number of recent hydrodynamical simulations ( boss 1998 ; mayer 2002 ) employing isothermal equation of state ( eos ) have confirmed this general picture and provided ample support for the idea of planet formation by gi .",
    "the goal of this study is to constrain this avenue of planet formation by putting special emphasis on the conditions necessary for the actual fragmentation of protoplanetary disk into self - gravitating objects .",
    "gravitational instability in a keplerian disk can operate only when the gas sound speed @xmath9 , surface density @xmath10 and local angular frequency @xmath11 satisfy the condition @xmath12 ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) . here",
    "@xmath13 is the so - called `` toomre @xmath13 '' ; sound speed is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the disk midplane temperature , @xmath16 is the gas molecular weight , and @xmath17 is a boltzmann constant .",
    "analytical arguments and results of numerical simulations suggest that @xmath18 .",
    "equivalent way of formulating the condition for operation of gi is to require @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a midplane gas density and @xmath21 is the distance from the central star scaled by @xmath22 au .    dynamical constraint ( [ eq : dyn_constr ] ) is a necessary condition for gi to set in .",
    "however , even when ( [ eq : dyn_constr ] ) is fulfilled , giant planet formation becomes possible only if the disk can actually _ fragment _ into bound self - gravitating objects .",
    "recent studies ( gammie 2001 ; rice 2003 ) have demonstrated that fragmentation is possible only provided that the cooling time of the disk @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a parameter of the order of unity ; numerical simulations ( gammie 2001 ; rice 2003 ) suggest that @xmath26 .    cooling time of the disk can be estimated as the ratio of its thermal energy to the escaping radiative flux : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the stephan - boltzmann constant , @xmath15 is the midplane disk temperature , @xmath29 is the disk optical depth ( @xmath30 is the opacity ) , and @xmath31 is the adiabatic index of gas .",
    "function @xmath32 describes the efficiency of disk cooling and its specific form in ( [ eq : t_cool ] ) corresponds to the case when cooling is radiative . when the disk is optically thick , @xmath33 , radiation has to leak out through the large optical depth of the disk material ; this lowers the effective temperature at the disk photosphere by a factor of @xmath34 compared to the midplane temperature @xmath15 and makes @xmath23 very long [ first term in the definition of @xmath32 ] . in the optically thin case ,",
    "@xmath36 , according to the kirchhoff s law ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) disk emissivity is low and @xmath23 is again very large [ second term in the definition of @xmath32 ] .",
    "thus , disk cools most effectively when @xmath37 .",
    "what is most important for our further discussion is that the value of @xmath32 is above unity for any @xmath38 and any cooling mechanism because effective temperature of the disk can not exceed its midplane temperature .",
    "dynamical constraint ( [ eq : dyn_constr ] ) limits the value of the sound speed from above . at the same time , expressing the temperature in ( [ eq : t_cool ] ) through @xmath9 we find that ( [ eq : thermal_constr ] ) sets a lower limit on the gas sound speed .",
    "combination of these conditions leads to the following constraint on @xmath9 necessary for the giant planet formation by gi : @xmath39^{1/6}<c_s<\\pi   q_0\\frac{g\\sigma}{\\omega } ,   \\label{eq : bound}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 . only when ( [ eq : bound ] ) is fulfilled can the disk be gravitationally unstable and cooling be fast enough for fragmentation to allow the formation of bound gaseous clumps , which later collapse to become giant planets .",
    "similar argument has been advanced by levin ( 2003 ) in application to self - gravitating disks around agns .        in the form given by ( [ eq : sig_min])-([eq : t_constr ] ) constraints on the disk surface density and temperature still depend on the behavior of opacity .",
    "however , bearing in mind that @xmath55 for any @xmath38 , one immediately sees that values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent _ absolute opacity - independent lower limits _ on the disk surface density and temperature .",
    "thus , we conclude that for the gravitationally unstable disk to be able to fragment ( which is necessary for giant planets formation ) disk has to satisfy _ at least _",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these lower limits are extremely robust since they do not depend on a specific mechanism of energy losses from the disk  by radiation or by convection . in practice , taking into account even the most basic properties of the energy transfer within the disk one can formulate much more stringent constraints , as we demonstrate below .",
    "protoplanetary disk luminosity @xmath60 and mass @xmath61 are the characteristics which can be directly observed ( or constrained using observations ) . according to ( [ eq : sig_min ] ) , mass of a protoplanetary disk which is capable of planet formation in the range of semimajor axes from @xmath62 to @xmath63",
    "has to satisfy @xmath64 this and all subsequent numerical estimates assume @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note a rather weak dependence of @xmath61 on the disk dimensions .",
    "for the inner disk cutoff at @xmath67 au and outer disk cutoff at @xmath68 au one finds that @xmath69 m@xmath3 ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "this estimate assumes maximum cooling efficiency throughout the whole disk , i.e @xmath71 , but even such lowest possible limit on @xmath61 well exceeds the mass of the central star .",
    "this constraint on the disk mass can be somewhat relaxed if disk is producing planets only locally .",
    "indeed , the typical scale length of the fastest - growing perturbation in the marginally gravitationally unstable disk ( @xmath72 ) is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the vertical disk scaleheight .",
    "thus , to form planets by gi it is , in principle , sufficient that only an annulus of the disk with the radial width of order @xmath75 has surface density and temperature exceeding @xmath76 and @xmath77 . using ( [ eq : c_s_constr ] ) we can estimate @xmath78^{1/5}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\approx 0.23~a_{au}^{-1/10 } \\left[\\frac{f(\\tau)}{\\tilde \\mu^{4}}\\right]^{1/5 } \\left(\\frac{m_\\star}{m_\\odot}\\right)^{-3/10}. \\label{eq : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the high midplane temperature ( necessary to ensure efficient cooling ) disk is not very thin geometrically ; as a result , gi is likely to have global character .",
    "mass of such a `` minimum planet - forming annulus '' centered on @xmath79 and having width @xmath75 is constrained by @xmath80^{2/5 } \\tilde \\mu^{-8/5 } \\left(\\frac{m_\\star}{m_\\odot}\\right)^{2/5}. \\label{eq : m_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , this lower limit on @xmath81 depends only very weakly on the semimajor axis of annulus .",
    "it also amounts to a sizable fraction of @xmath44 [ even for molecular gas with @xmath82 and @xmath71 one finds @xmath83 m@xmath3 at @xmath22 au ] . at the same time",
    ", typical masses of protoplanetary disks inferred from mm and infrared observations vary between @xmath84 m@xmath3 and @xmath85 m@xmath3 ( kitamura 2002 ) , but these masses of gas are typically extended over @xmath86 au in disk radius ( and not within just a narrow annulus ) . besides , in the real nebula such annulus can easily be either very optically thick or very optically thin , which translates into large value of @xmath32 , additionally increasing the lower limit on @xmath81 ( see below ) .",
    "energy flux emitted from both sides by a unit surface area of the disk is given by @xmath87^{3/5 } \\left[\\frac{(k/\\mu)^{3/2}}{\\pi g}\\right]^{8/5 } \\label{eq : emissivity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we made use of ( [ eq : t_constr ] ) . since @xmath88 most of the energy",
    "is radiated by the innermost part of the gravitationally unstable disk .",
    "total luminosity of a disk with an inner cutoff at @xmath79 is @xmath89^{3/5 } \\left(\\frac{m_\\star}{m_\\odot } \\right)^{8/5}. \\label{eq : l_d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this estimate of luminosity holds even if only an annulus of gas is considered instead of the full disk , which is a direct consequence of the very steep dependence of @xmath90 on the distance from the central star .",
    "we now consider what these limits imply for the disk properties at different locations in the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "first we consider the possibility of giant planet formation by gi in the region of terrestrial planets , at @xmath91 au .",
    "constraints obtained in previous sections imply that planetary genesis at this location requires rather extreme disk properties : temperature has to exceed at least @xmath92 k ( this estimate is based using @xmath93 in [ [ eq : t_constr ] ] since gas can not be molecular at such temperature ) , surface density must be above @xmath94 g @xmath48 , and disk luminosity has to exceed @xmath95 l@xmath3 ( all assuming @xmath66 and @xmath65 ) . depending on whether an extended disk or just a minimum size annulus is considered ,",
    "minimum mass varies from @xmath96 m@xmath3 to @xmath97 m@xmath3 .",
    "apparently , even these least radical requirements are in complete disagreement with the observed properties of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the argument can be significantly sharpened by noticing that the disk with such high surface density has to be optically very thick , meaning that @xmath76 and @xmath77 provide much more stringent limits on the disk properties than @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "using opacity dependence @xmath98 on the temperature @xmath15 and gas density @xmath20 ( given by [ [ eq : rho_constr ] ] ) from bell & lin ( 1994 ) we can substitute @xmath99 into ( [ eq : sig_min ] ) and ( [ eq : t_min ] ) and solve the resulting system for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . performing this procedure",
    "one finds that at @xmath22 au disk has to be extremely hot so that opacity is due to electron scattering .",
    "disk temperature has to exceed @xmath100 k , but this is impossible , because such disk would not be bound to the central star and its radiation pressure would far dominate over the gas pressure .",
    "this firmly rules out the possibility of giant planet formation by gi within several au from the central star .      at @xmath0",
    "au , in the region of giant planets , temperature will probably be low enough for the gas to be molecular .",
    "using @xmath101 we find @xmath102 g @xmath103 and @xmath104 k. disk luminosity has to exceed only @xmath105 l@xmath3 , and the full disk and minimum mass annulus have to contain at least @xmath106 m@xmath3 ( for @xmath68 au ) and @xmath107 m@xmath3 correspondingly .",
    "these limits are more reasonable than at @xmath22 au , although mass is still high and disk is too hot compared to the observed systems , which typically have @xmath108 m@xmath3 and @xmath109 k at @xmath0 au ( e.g. kitamura 2002 ) .",
    "however , using again opacities from bell & lin ( 1994 ) and @xmath20 as given by ( [ eq : rho_constr ] ) we find that real disks ( i.e. cooling not at the maximum efficiency ) should be considerably more extreme . there are several possible solutions for @xmath77 and @xmath76 at @xmath0 au corresponding to different opacity regimes .",
    "the least extreme one is a `` cold '' solution with @xmath110 , @xmath111 k , @xmath112 g @xmath48 , @xmath113 l@xmath3 , @xmath114 m@xmath3 which corresponds to molecular gas at the temperature of grain evaporation ( other solutions have @xmath115 k ) .",
    "this again yields a minimum disk which is too massive and hot to satisfy current observational constraints .",
    "thus , it is extremely unlikely that gi can allow disk fragmentation and subsequent giant planet formation even at @xmath0 au .",
    "we also look at the possibility of giant planet formation by gi in the distant regions of protoplanetary nebula , at @xmath116 au . for molecular disk at this location",
    "we find @xmath117 g @xmath103 , @xmath118 k , @xmath119 l@xmath3 , and @xmath120 m@xmath3 .",
    "these properties change only a little when inefficiency of disk cooling is properly accounted for : using @xmath121 @xmath122 g@xmath123 in agreement with observations of protoplanetary nebulae ( beckwith 1990 ; kitamura 2002 ) we find that to be able to form giant planets by gi disk has possess at least @xmath124 ( marginally optically thick ) , @xmath125 k , @xmath126 g @xmath48 , @xmath127 l@xmath3 , and @xmath128 m@xmath3 at @xmath5 au .",
    "although @xmath81 is very near the upper end of the observed distribution of protoplanetary disk masses , these parameters seem to be acceptable from the observational point of view .",
    "there are however additional reasons to doubt the possibility of planet formation by gi even at @xmath5 au , which we discuss next .",
    "another important observational constraint on the planet formation by gi comes from comparing the observed masses of extrasolar giant planets with the typical masses of fragments into which disk breaks up when @xmath129 . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", the lengthscale of the most unstable mode is @xmath73 , which results in the minimum fragment mass of @xmath130^{3/5 } \\left(\\frac{m_\\star}{m_\\odot } \\right)^{1/10}. \\label{eq : m_f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath5 au molecular disk meeting the requirements outlined in  [ subsect:100_au ] would fragment into self - gravitating clumps with the mass of roughly @xmath131 m@xmath132^{3/5}$ ] , where @xmath133 is the jupiter s mass ; at smaller semimajor axes @xmath134 would be higher . even for @xmath71 this mass is larger than masses of most extrasolar giant planets detected to date ( marcy 2003 ) .",
    "more realistic cooling efficiency corresponding to the optical depth of @xmath124 at @xmath5 au leads to @xmath135 m@xmath7 , landing minimum fragment mass not too far from the brown dwarf regime .",
    "it is possible that such clumps would be able to further fragment into smaller objects but we view this outcome as rather unlikely . indeed , as the fragment contracts its optical depth increases and cooling time in this nonlinear regime becomes larger than the dynamical time of collapsing fragment , which disfavors subsequent fragmentation ( goodman & tan 2004 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how the centrifugal support of the collapsing clump can change this conclusion .",
    "novel analytical constraints presented in  [ sect : constraints ] and [ sect : application ] , when confronted with observations of protoplanetary disks , severely undermine the possibility of giant planet formation by gi . in particular , we have demonstrated that disks capable of producing giant planets by gi at a distance of several au from the central star can not exist simply on dynamical grounds  to cool efficiently they must be too hot to be bound to the central object .",
    "this essentially rules out a possibility of in situ formation of close - in extrasolar giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' ) by gi .",
    "rafikov ( 2004 ) have previously presented arguments against in situ formation of `` hot jupiters '' via the core instability . then the most natural way to explain",
    "the existence of close - in giant planets is to accept that they have formed elsewhere under more favorable conditions and then migrated to their current locations .",
    "planet formation by gi is also extremely unlikely within several tens of au , as results of  [ subsect:10_au ] demonstrate : disks with required properties must be so hot ( @xmath136 k ) , luminous ( several tens of @xmath137 ) , and massive ( @xmath138 ) that they would clearly stand out in a sample of observed protoplanetary nebulae . beyond about @xmath5 au minimum disk properties allowing planets to form by gi become roughly acceptable from the observational point of view , although disk masses still reside at the very upper end of the observed distribution of protoplanetary nebulae masses .",
    "however , it is still very unlikely that the extrasolar giant planets that we see now could have been produced by gi even at several hundred au from the central star .",
    "the problem is not only in a potential difficulty of migrating such planets from beyond @xmath5 au all the way in to several au , but also in producing planets with the right mass .",
    "as our estimate ( [ eq : m_f ] ) of the minimum mass of unstable disk fragments demonstrates , bound objects produced by gi even at @xmath5 au are too massive ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) to explain the observed mass distribution of extrasolar planets .",
    "our study emphasizes the importance of the proper treatment of disk thermodynamics ( especially its cooling ) for studying the possibility of jupiter - like planet formation . by now",
    "virtually all simulations which were able to demonstrate disk fragmentation and collapse of resulting dense objects in gravitationally unstable disks used isothermal eos ( e.g. mayer 2002 ) . however , use of this eos is equivalent to setting the disk cooling time to zero which artificially relaxes the requirements for the planet production process and is misleading .",
    "not surprisingly , more realistic calculations following thermodynamics in greater detail typically do not exhibit fragmentation of gravitationally unstable disks which are not capable of cooling efficiently ( pickett 1998 ; gammie 2001 ; rice 2003 ) .",
    "thus , simulations employing isothermal eos should not be trusted too much when planet formation in real protoplanetary disks is concerned .",
