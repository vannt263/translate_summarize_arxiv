    "since many of these millisecond radio pulsars are in binary systems , it has long been suspected ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an extended review ) that the neutron stars were spun up by mass transfer from a stellar companion in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",

    "the reason(s ) for this difference between accreting millisecond pulsars is not know ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . from the correlations between the spectral and timing variability it was also conclude that the behavior of xte j1814338 was consistent with that of an atoll source ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
