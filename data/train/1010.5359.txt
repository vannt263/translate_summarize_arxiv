    "in 1953 watson and crick @xcite proposed the structure of dna to be a stable double - stranded helix .",
    "the stability comes through the staking interaction and the hydrogen bonding between the base pairs in the opposite strands .",
    "but actually this picture represents the equilibrium structure of dna under physiological conditions . as the interaction energy between these base pairs is only few @xmath0 , even at room temperature due to thermal fluctuations",
    "locally dna strand opens up creating what is called  bubbles \" .",
    "these bubbles have different sizes and lifetimes .",
    "the creation and annihilation kinetics of these bubbles is termed as the breathing dynamics .",
    "on increasing the temperature or changing the ph these bubbles add up to form larger bubbles and eventually the double stranded dna denatures .",
    "in recent past single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) experiment by altan - bonnet et .",
    "al @xcite has provided the first quantitative insight to the relaxation kinetics of the breathing mode of the double - stranded dna .",
    "this breathing mode refers to local denaturation and reclosing of the double - stranded structure . in their experiment ,",
    "two bases of the double - stranded dna , corresponding to opposite strands are tagged with a fluorophore and a quencher respectively .",
    "so when the dna structure is closed , fluorophore and the quencher are in close proximity and the fluorescence is quenched .",
    "but due to thermal fluctuation when the dna structure opens up creating a bubble , the fluorescence is restored .",
    "hence the base pair fluctuation leads to a fluctuation in fluorescence intensity .",
    "this fluctuation in fluorescence intensity is monitored by fcs which determines the characteristic dynamics of the relaxation of dynamic correlations in the fluctuation of base pairs .",
    "they introduced a correlation function    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the fluorescent intensity at time @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 was found to be multiexponential .",
    "interestingly the correlation function for all the dna constructs , at all temperatures follow the same universal temporal behavior and when presented as a function of rescaled time they all collapse into a single universal curve @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is such that @xmath7 . to explain the experimental data they proposed a simple kinetic model in which @xmath5 becomes    @xmath8    where , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a parameter which is adjusted to @xmath11 to ensure that @xmath12 .    since this experimental work by altan - bonnet et .",
    "al , the topic  bubble dynamics \" as it is commonly refereed to has received a great deal of theoretical attention .",
    "just few years after this seminal experimental study of the transient time - dependent rupture and re - healing of double stranded dna , bicout and kats @xcite proposed a kinetic scheme based on two state model ( closed or open ) of the double stranded dna .",
    "their formulation gave an analytical expression for the survival probability , correlation function and life time for the bubble relaxation dynamics but formulation did not consider the structure of the double stranded dna at any level .",
    "very recently srivastava and singh @xcite proposed a theoretical model where the interaction between the base pairs of the opposite dna strands is described by peyard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd ) @xcite potential and the separation between the base pairs (  y \" in their notation ) follows a fokker - planck equation . thus only making the interaction realistic but still not taking into account of the dynamics of the chain and restricting to a single relevant dynamical variable ( separation  y \" ) description . in a paper by jeon , sung and ree @xcite double stranded dna was modeled as a duplex of semiflexible chains mutually bonded by weak interactions in other words they used an extended worm - like chain model and a langevin dynamics simulation was performed to examine the size distribution and dynamics of the bubble . shortly after this fogedby and metzler @xcite came up with a theoretical model for the bubble dynamics .",
    "they used the poland - scheraga free energy @xcite where the free energy is a function of bubble size @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath13 follows a langevin equation and the corresponding fokker - planck equation is analogous to the imaginary time schrodinger equation for a particle moving in a coulomb potential subject to a centrifugal barrier .",
    "this mapping enabled them to calculate the correlation function . but the best fit to the long time behavior was obtained only when they considered the dynamics of @xmath13 in a linear potential . thus to reproduce the long time data",
    "one can merely start with a linear potential but unfortunately it may not fit to the experimental data in the intermediate time range .",
    "interestingly the shortcomings of the fogedly - metzler model was pointed out by chatterjee et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the distance between fluorophore and the quencher follows an overdamped langevin equation in a harmonic potential .",
    "although their theory predicts the experimental data reasonably well it does not take into account of the fluctuation of different modes of the dna strand contributing to the bubble dynamics .",
    "a better theory should account for those and actually our model does . in our formulation",
    "the dna - strand is described by a rouse chain @xcite confined at both the ends .",
    "transverse displacement of the string accounts for the bubble formation .",
    "naturally our model takes into account of the contribution of different modes of the string to the breathing dynamics .",
    "we describe the bubble by a confined rouse chain @xcite in a harmonic potential , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the position of the @xmath16th segment of the confined rouse chain in space and @xmath3 is the time . in other words",
    "the chain is described by a field @xmath15 . because of the thermal fluctuations the bubble undergoes brownian motion and its time development is described by the equation    @xmath17    in the above",
    ", @xmath18 is the friction coefficient for the @xmath16th segment and @xmath19 is the force constant for the confining potential which accounts for the staking interaction between the opposite strands of the dna molecule .",
    "the fluorescent intensity at time @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath2 can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 denotes the position of the @xmath22th segment in space . later on",
    "we will choose @xmath22 such that it corresponds to the center of the bubble .",
    "as mentioned earlier in the experiment one measures the following correlation function .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is the the relevant dynamical coordinate / variable in our model .",
    "obviously it is not a one dimensional phenomenological reaction coordinate / dynamical variable like the separation between the donor and the acceptor as considered by chatterjee et al .",
    "@xcite but actually a collective dynamical variable in the sense that it has the contribution from all the normal modes of the chain as is shown later in eq.(6 ) .",
    "@xmath1    so in order to evaluate @xmath4 we should first evaluate @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in our model the correlation function , @xmath24 would be    @xmath25    then we use the fact that the step function can be expressed as an integral over delta function and in the next step we use the fourier integral representation of the delta function .",
    "@xmath26    now @xmath15 follows rouse dynamics and it has a boundary conditions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the chain length .",

    "unfortunately one of the integrals over @xmath48 ( say @xmath58 ) can not be performed analytically and has to be carried out numerically .",
    "now as done earlier in the calculation of @xmath24 here also one should consider the contribution due to the displacement of the string in the opposite direction which corresponds to negative @xmath48 .",

    "here we make a comparison of our model with the experimental data obtained by altan - bonett et al @xcite.the fitting function they used has already been mentioned at the beginning ( eq . ( [ gexp ] ) ) .",
    "figure 1 is a comparison of our model with altan - bonett fitting function ( eq .",
    "( [ gexp ] ) ) . the comparison",
    "are made for a fixed set of parameters ( @xmath81 ) while changing the force constant of the confined harmonic well ( @xmath19 ) which is also a measure of the strength of h - bonding and staking interaction between the base pairs .",
    "changing @xmath19 by keeping other parameters unchanged physically means changing the relaxation time of the normal modes of the chain as @xmath82 .",
    "thus a smaller value of @xmath19 results slow relaxation of the normal modes and a larger @xmath19 results faster relaxation of normal modes .",
    "another interesting observation is that the relaxation time for the higher normal modes ( larger @xmath35 ) have very weak dependence on @xmath19 , while the relaxation times for the lower normal modes ( smaller @xmath35 ) have stronger @xmath19 dependence .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "1 that there exist at least one value of @xmath19 ( when all the other parameters are kept fixed ) for which a very good comparison with altan - bonett results can be made . moreover a small change in the value of @xmath19 results poor comparison with the experimental result as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( dashed , blue ) . a smaller value of @xmath19 makes the dynamics slower as expected and also a higher value results faster decay of the autocorrelation function ( green , dashed - dot ) .",
    "this strong @xmath19 dependence also suggests that the lower normal modes of the strand mostly contribute to bubble dynamics .",
    "here we would also like to mention that the choice of a particular set of parameters is not unique as more than one set of values can also be used to make a reasonably well comparison as is also found with the model of chatterjee et al @xcite .      in this section",
    "we explore the short and long time behavior of @xmath4 .",
    "let us first consider the correlation function used to fit the experimental data by altan - bonett eq .",
    "( [ gexp ] ) . at short time",
    "one can approximate , @xmath83\\simeq 1-\\frac{2 z}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}$ ] as ( @xmath84 ) and the correlation function becomes @xmath85 .",
    "thus it behaves as a power law .",
    "to explore the long time limit we use the following approximation , @xmath86\\simeq \\frac{e^{-z^2}}{z\\sqrt{\\pi } } $ ] as ( @xmath87 ) , which gives @xmath88 .",
    "now it would be interesting to see what happens to @xmath4 ( or @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) in our formulation .",
    "all time dependence in @xmath4 comes through @xmath23 or in other words through @xmath91 and @xmath92 defined earlier . to analyze the the short time behavior of @xmath4 we first rewrite short time @xmath64 as    @xmath93    where , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "using the above short time expression for @xmath64 and keeping the leading order in @xmath3 the short time expression of @xmath91 simplifies to    @xmath96    with @xmath97 and @xmath98    similarly    @xmath99    where    @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    then combining eq .",

    "next we analyze the long time behavior of @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned earlier all the time dependence of @xmath4 comes from @xmath64 which is embedded in @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as in the long time",
    ", @xmath111 , one can further simplifies the expressions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 . to do this consider the complimentary error function sitting inside the integral in eq .",

    "similarly we get the long time limit of @xmath92 by following the above steps .",
    "it shows that the autocorrelation function @xmath4 approaches zero the same way @xmath64 approaches zero in the long time limit .",
    "thus in the long time limit @xmath4 approaches zero as @xmath117 as is also predicted by altan - bonett fitting model .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of dna bubble formed due to rupture and reformation of hydrogen bonds is modeled based on a rouse chain description of the dna strand . although the model is very simple it produces the experimental results of altan - bonett reasonably well .",
    "unlike other well known models @xcite our model goes beyond a single reaction coordinate or order parameter description by taking into account of the collective nature of the dynamics through different modes of the chain as is done in the rouse description in the simplest possible way .",
    "the dynamics seems to be very sensitive to the relaxation times of different normal modes of the chain which is physically understandable as the  bubble dynamics \" should have the contribution from all the possible normal mode of vibration of the chain .",
    "however the current model probably can not account for the bubble size distribution .",
