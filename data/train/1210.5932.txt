    "we consider the @xmath0-user multiple access relay channel ( marc ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : marc ] . source nodes @xmath5 want to transmit messages to the destination node @xmath1 with the help of the relay node @xmath2 all the nodes are assumed to have half - duplex constraint , i.e. , the nodes can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band . in a @xmath0-user marc ,",
    "the maximum diversity order obtainable is two , since in addition to the presence of direct links , communication paths exist from the source nodes to the destination node @xmath1 through the relay node @xmath2      in a fading scenario , multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) antenna systems provide gain in terms of spatial diversity .",
    "however , in many practical scenarios , it is difficult to place multiple collocated antennas in a single terminal .",
    "an attractive alternative to obtain diversity gain without using multiple antennas , is the utilization of intermediate relay nodes which aid the transmission from the source nodes to the destination nodes . in order to exploit the presence of intermediate relay nodes to obtain diversity gain ,",
    "the source nodes need to convey their messages to the relay nodes . due to the superposition nature of the wireless channel ,",
    "if the source nodes transmit simultaneously in the same frequency band , interference occurs at the relay nodes . a loss of spectral efficiency results , if the source nodes transmit in orthogonal time / frequency slots .",
    "a solution to this problem is the use of physical layer network coding , first introduced in @xcite , in which the nodes are allowed to transmit simultaneously .",
    "physical layer network coding ( pnc ) has been shown to outperform traditional schemes which involve orthogonal transmissions @xcite@xcite .",
    "so far , most of the works on pnc have mainly focussed only on the two - way relay channel . in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we proposed a scheme based on pnc for the two user marc . in this paper",
    ", we present the generalization of the scheme proposed in @xcite for the @xmath0-user marc .    for the marc , a complex field network coding ( cfnc ) scheme was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the cfnc scheme , like the pnc scheme , avoids the loss of spectral efficiency , by making the source nodes transmit simultaneously .",
    "but the major difference between the cfnc scheme and the proposed pnc scheme is that during the relaying phase , the cfnc scheme uses a signal set of size @xmath6 at @xmath7 whereas the proposed pnc scheme uses a signal set of size @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the size of the signal set used at the source nodes .    as noted in @xcite ,",
    "if the relay node transmits a many - to - one function of the estimates of the messages transmitted by the source nodes and minimum squared euclidean distance decoder is employed at d , a loss of diversity order results .",
    "this problem of loss of diversity order due to error propagation , is encountered in many other wireless scenarios as well and various solutions have been proposed to avoid this problem .",
    "cyclic redundancy check bits are used so that the nodes forward only those packets which are decoded correctly @xcite",
    ". some works assume the knowledge of all the instantaneous fade coefficients or error probabilities associated with the intermediate nodes at the destination node , with the decoder at the destination using this knowledge to ensure full diversity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the cfnc scheme proposed in @xcite , uses a scaling factor at the relay node which depends on the instantaneous fade coefficients associated with the links from the source nodes to the relay node , with the scaling factor indicated to the destination using pilot symbols .",
    "the proposed scheme does not suffer from the disadvantages of any of the above methods , yet ensures the maximum possible diversity order .",
    "this is achieved by means of an efficient choice of the transmission scheme and the use of a novel decoder at the destination @xmath10    for the proposed pnc scheme , making the source nodes also transmit during the relaying phase , combined with a novel decoder ensures the maximum possible diversity order of two .",
    "furthermore , if certain parameters are chosen properly , the proposed decoder for the pnc scheme can be implemented with a decoding complexity order same as that of the cfnc scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "for the two - way relay channel , the network coding maps used at the relay node need to form a mathematical structure called latin squares , for ensuring unique decodability at the end nodes @xcite .",
    "the structural properties of latin squares have been used to obtain the network coding maps in a two - way relay channel @xcite@xcite .",
    "interestingly , choosing the network coding map used at r to be a @xmath0-dimensional latin hypercube , which is the generalization of the latin square to @xmath0 dimensions , helps towards achieving the maximum diversity order of two for the @xmath0-user marc .",
    "1.7 in   [ fig : phase1 ]    1.7 in   [ fig : phase2 ]    the main advantages of the proposed scheme over the cfnc scheme proposed in @xcite are summarized below :    * in the cfnc scheme , @xmath11 transmits a complex linear combination of the estimate of the messages transmitted by the source node and the signal set used at @xmath11 during the relaying phase has @xmath6 points , where @xmath9 is the size of the signal set used at the source nodes .",
    "the minimum distance of the signal set used during the relaying phase vanishes as @xmath0 increases . in contrast , since the proposed pnc scheme uses a many - to - one map , the signal set used during the relaying phase has only @xmath9 points .",
    "the minimum distance of the signal set used at @xmath11 is more than that of the cfnc scheme and it remains the same irrespective of the number of source nodes @xmath12 hence the proposed scheme performs better than the cfnc scheme .",
    "simulation results presented for the 3-user and 4-user marc confirm that the proposed pnc scheme provides a large gain over the cfnc scheme . * in the cfnc scheme , @xmath11 uses a scaling factor which is a function of the instantaneous fade coefficients associated with the links from the source nodes to the relay node , which needs to be indicated to @xmath1 using pilot symbols .",
