    "understanding the origin of life is one of the main challenges of modern science .",
    "it is believed that some basic prebiotic chemistry could have developed in space , likely tranferring prebiotic molecules to the solar nebula , which were finally delivered to earth .",
    "studies of the chemical composition of comets have indeed reported that these objects exhibit a rich chemistry in complex organic molecules ( or coms ) that are commonly detected in the ism ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the spacecraft rosetta studied the chemical composition of the comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko , and found 16 different coms of prebiotic interest such as glycoladehyde ( ch@xmath6ohcho ) , formamide ( nh@xmath6cho ) @xcite , and even the simplest amino acid glycine @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a new molecule was detected by the rosetta mission with a relatively high abundance compared to other coms present in the comet : the simplest isocyanate ( methyl isocyanate , ch@xmath0nco ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which like nh@xmath6cho ( the simplest amide ) contains c , n , and o atoms .",
    "isocyanates are a family of prebiotic coms that could play an key role in the synthesis of aminoacid chains known as peptides @xcite .",
    "subsequent to the detection of ch@xmath0nco in comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko , this molecule was also detected in the massive hot molecular cores sgrb2",
    "n @xcite and orion kl @xcite .",
    "however , ch@xmath0nco has not been detected so far toward solar - type protostars , the environment where we expect earth - like planets to form .",
    "iras 16293@xmath82422 ( hereafter iras16293 ) is located in the @xmath9 ophiuchi cloud complex at a distance of 120 pc @xcite , and it is considered an excellent low - mass protostar template for astrochemical studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its molecular spectra is rich in coms which has allowed the detection of molecular species such as glycoladehyde and formamide ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with deuterated molecules @xcite , and exotic species such as ch@xmath0sh @xcite .",
    "iras16293 is a binary system with components a and b separated in the plane of the sky by 5@xmath10 ( @xmath7600 au ) , and whose masses are @xmath70.5 m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "their emission exhibits line profiles with different linewidths of up to 8 km s@xmath12 for iras 16293 a and @xmath13 2 km s@xmath12 for iras 16293 b. the narrow emission of iras 16293 b , along with its rich com chemistry , makes this object the perfect target to search for new coms .    in this letter , we report the first detection of ch@xmath0nco towards the solar - type protostar iras 16293@xmath82422 b carried out with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "the comparison between the derived column density and our chemical modelling suggests that ch@xmath0nco can be formed via gas - phase reactions after the evaporation of hnco from dust grains .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this model , hnco is formed mainly via hydrogenation on the surface of dust grains , and once the temperature of the dust reaches a temperature of @xmath7100 k , hnco is thermally desorbed and incorporated into the gas phase",
    ". the gas - phase chemistry formation of ch@xmath0nco can thus proceed ( see reactions above and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yielding a ch@xmath0nco abundance very close to the value measured toward iras16293 b ( of @xmath14 ) in this study . since no other mechanisms are required to explain the observed abundance of this molecule , we propose that gas phase formation may be the dominant mechanism for the production of ch@xmath0nco . we also stress that the predicted abundance of ch@xmath0nco does not depend on the maximum temperature assumed in our model ( we obtain the same results for t = 100 k and t = 250 k ) , as long as this temperature is high enough ( @xmath15100 k)to induce the full evaporation of the ices and the conversion of hnco into ch@xmath0nco",
    "alternatively , ch@xmath0nco could be produced by uv photoprocessing of hnco - containing interstellar ices , and subsequently be desorbed to the gas phase @xcite .",
    "this scenario is not taken into account in our chemical model , but could be needed if any ch@xmath0nco gas - phase destruction route were included , thus requiring an additional source of ch@xmath0nco molecules .",
    "we present the first detection of ch@xmath0nco toward a solar - type protostar .",
    "the derived abundance of 7@xmath210@xmath5 is similar to that measured in hot cores , although the column density ratios with other chemically related n- , c- , o - bearing species do not show an agreement overall .",
    "the ch@xmath0nco / nh@xmath6cho column density ratio is the only one that agrees best across all environments in which ch@xmath0nco has been detected so far ( hot corinos , hot cores and comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ) . the observed ch@xmath0nco abundance in iras16293 b is well reproduced by a chemical model taking into account only the gas - phase formation of this species , although an origin in the solid phase remains to be explored .",
    "alma is a partnership of eso ( representing its member states ) , nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with nrc ( canada ) , nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) , and kasi ( republic of korea ) , in co - operation with the republic of chile .",
