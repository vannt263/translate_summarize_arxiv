    "nearly 20 grb sources have measured redshifts ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) , with a mean redshift @xmath11 for the sample .",
    "the distribution of redshifts is as yet poorly established , but ranges from @xmath12 for grb 980425 to @xmath13 for grb 000131 .",
    "the redshift of grb 980425 is based upon its temporal and spatial coincidence with sn 1998bw @xcite , and points to a relationship between grb sources and supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "a grb / sn relationship is strengthened by the detection of highly reddened excesses in the optical afterglows of several grbs , which would arise if supernova ejecta , powered by the decay of radioactive @xmath14ni @xcite , are formed in grb explosions .",
    "measured apparent isotropic @xmath15-ray energy releases range from @xmath16 ergs for grb 980425 to @xmath17 ergs for grb 990123 at @xmath18 , with @xmath19 ergs in all cases except grb 980425 @xcite .",
    "achromatic temporal breaks in the optical light curves of grb 990123 @xcite and grb 990510 @xcite suggest , however , that the most luminous grbs might be beamed , so that only directional energy releases are actually measured . in the case of grb",
    "990123 @xcite , the directional @xmath15-ray power and @xmath15-ray energy release reach peak values @xmath20 ergs s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 and @xmath21 ergs sr@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "considerable evidence linking the sources of grbs with star - forming regions in galaxies has recently been obtained @xcite .",
    "optical transients associated with grbs are superposed on the stellar fields of associated host galaxies in essentially all 14 cases of grbs with deep follow - up optical observations @xcite , rather than far outside the galaxies disks , as might be expected in a scenario of merging neutron stars and black holes @xcite .",
    "host galaxies that are directionally coincident with optical transients discovered within the field of grb x - ray afterglows have blue colors , consistent with galaxy types that are undergoing active star formation @xcite .",

    "lack of optical counterparts in some grbs such as grb 970828 and grb 991226 , which have associated radio counterparts @xcite , could be due to extreme reddening from large quantities of gas and dust in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "x - ray evidence @xcite for fe k@xmath25-line signatures in grb 991216 , requiring large masses and column densities of nearby gas @xcite , also indicates that grbs originate in regions with active star formation .",
    "knowledge of the distance scale to grbs makes it possible to determine their effects on the surrounding environment .",
    "some of the claimed effects of grb explosions are the formation of hi shells and stellar arcs @xcite , the melting of dust grains by grb uv radiation to produce flash - heated chondrules in the early solar system @xcite , and the formation of sites of enhanced annihilation radiation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) originating from large numbers of mildly relativistic positrons produced by a grb @xcite .",
    "uv and x - rays from nearby grbs could also have produced biologically significant dosages on earth in the past @xcite .",
    "another effect of grbs , proposed prior to the beppo - sax discovery , is that grb sources accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "@xcite argued for this connection on the basis of a directional association of two @xmath26 ev air shower events with earlier batse grbs .",
    "@xcite pointed out , however , that the intergalactic field must disperse the arrival time of the cosmic rays by @xmath27 yrs to be consistent with the detection rate of grbs .",
    "@xcite noted that the isotropy of the uhecr arrival direction was consistent with the isotropic distribution of grb sources , and that the extreme energies of uhecrs could be explained through first - order fermi acceleration by a relativistic blast wave with lorentz factor @xmath28 . at each shock",
    "crossing , a particle would increase its energy by a factor @xmath29 , so that only a few such cycles would suffice to produce uhecrs starting from low - energy particles .",
    "the efficiency to accelerate low - energy particles to ultra - high energies through relativistic shock acceleration has since been shown to be infeasible @xcite . following the first shock crossing",
    ", the blast wave intercepts the particle before its angular deflection from the shock normal is much larger than @xmath30 ; thus subsequent cycles lead to energy increases by only factors of @xmath31 .",
    "second - order fermi acceleration , for example , due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence generated by charged dust or irregularities in the external medium @xcite , or by first - order fermi acceleration involving putative shocks in a relativistic wind @xcite could , however , accelerate uhecrs in grb blast waves .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite pointed out a remarkable coincidence between the energy density of the highest energy cosmic rays and the power of grb sources within the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) radius , outside of which uhecrs are degraded by photomeson production on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "if grb sources convert a comparable amount of energy into uhecrs as is detected in the form of @xmath15 rays , then these sources can account for the observed intensity of uhecrs .",
    "the comparisons of @xcite and @xcite made use of statistical studies where the most distant grbs detected with batse were assumed to be at @xmath11 .",
    "redshift measurements of grb sources now permit more refined studies of grb statistics , yielding the comoving space density of grb sources and the volume - averaged energy injection rate of grb sources into the ism .",
    "this coincidence can therefore be more carefully tested .    in this paper , it is assumed that the sources of uhecrs are grbs .",
    "we then examine the implications that follow from this assumption .",
    "theoretical problems with accelerating particles to ultra - high energies are not dealt with here ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in section 2 , we summarize a recent statistical study employing the external shock model for grbs @xcite and compare it with other statistical studies of grbs and the constant - energy - reservoir result of @xcite .",
    "an external shock model is more energetically efficient than internal shocks to generate @xmath15 rays in the prompt phase of a grb , so this study yields a lower limit to the energy production rate of grb sources per comoving volume .",
    "we show that an external shock model is consistent with the uhecr / grb hypothesis , so that the coincidence originally identified by @xcite and @xcite holds .    in section 3 ,",
    "the evolving temporal and spectral behavior of synchrotron radiation in grb blast waves is characterized .",
    "this radiation provides a target photon source for high - energy protons , and we calculate neutron and neutrino production from photopion processes in grb blast waves .",
    "neutral particle production spectra , integrated over the prompt and afterglow phases of a grb , are calculated .",
    "the diffuse high - energy neutrino background and the distribution of neutrino event rates are calculated in section 4 . the outflowing neutrons decay to form high - energy protons and electrons . in section 5 ,",
    "the radiation halos formed through synchrotron and thomson processes of neutron @xmath2-decay electrons are derived in the special case of a power - law distribution of neutrons that are impulsively released from a grb source .",
    "the hypothesis that hadronic cosmic rays originate from the subset of supernovae that collapse to form relativistic outflows and grbs is briefly considered in section 6 .",
    "fuller discussions of this hypothesis can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "appendix a gives the synchrotron radiation limit used to determine the maximum proton energies , and appendix b gives a scaling for the photomeson production efficiency in surrounding circumburster media ( cbm ) with different densities .",
    "the batse instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ provides a data base of peak count rates and peak fluxes for several thousand grbs with unknown redshifts @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to derive the grb rate density and mean luminosities by modeling this size distribution . even constraining the implied redshift distribution to be consistent with the @xmath32-distribution for the grbs with measured redshifts , it has not been possible to derive these quantities unambiguously from the size distribution alone .",
    "uncertainties in determining the rate density of grbs arise from lack of knowledge of the redshift distribution @xcite , the luminosity function @xcite , and the spectral shape @xcite of grbs .",
    "a useful simplification @xcite is to assume that the grb rate density is proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) history of the universe as traced , for example , by faint galaxy data in the hubble deep field @xcite ( which may , however , seriously underestimate the true star formation rate at @xmath33 @xcite ) .",
    "an important result is that grbs are unlikely to be standard candles , whether or not their birth rate follows the sfr or a range of reasonable evolutionary models @xcite .    to constrain the models further",
    ", @xcite jointly modeled the distributions of peak flux , duration , and peak photon energies of the @xmath34 spectra of grbs using an analytic representation @xcite of temporally evolving grb spectra in the external shock model of grbs .",
    "the assumption that the grb source density followed the star formation history of the universe was maintained , and a flat @xmath35cdm cosmology with @xmath36 and hubble constant @xmath37  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , with @xmath38 , was used .",
    "the model flux was folded through the simulated triggering response of a batse detector to determine detectability .",
    "this approach requires that the total energy @xmath39 and the initial blast wave lorentz factor @xmath40 of a grb source be specified .",
    "the burst luminosity is then calculated through the standard blast - wave physics that yielded the analytic representation of the grb spectrum .",
    "the analytic model is degenerate in the quantity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the density of the surrounding medium , which is assumed to be uniform .",
    "the photomeson production efficiency can be scaled from @xmath42 , as shown in appendix b.    @xcite showed that fixed values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 could not explain the observed distributions , and that broad ranges of values are required .",
    "the comoving differential density distribution of grb sources was obtained by assuming that the @xmath39 and @xmath40 distributions are separable from the redshift distribution and are adequately described by single power - law distributions .",
    "the rate - density distribution @xmath43 of grb sources that gives a reasonable fit to the size , duration , and peak photon energy distributions , in units of gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath45 , is @xmath46\\ ; h[\\gamma_0 ; 1,260]\\;. \\label{ndot}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ ndot ] ) , @xmath47 ergs , and the heaviside function is defined such that @xmath48= 1 $ ] for @xmath49 , and @xmath48= 0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "the range of @xmath40 given here corresponds to a density @xmath50 cm@xmath44 although , again , the model is degenerate in the quantity @xmath41 .",
    "the analytic representation of the sfr function , normalized to unity at @xmath52 , is @xmath53 ( note that the @xmath54 branch of this function was omitted in equation ( 12 ) of @xcite . )",
    "the burst rate and energy release rate per unit comoving volume by grb progenitors can be easily obtained from equation ( [ ndot ] ) . in the local universe , we find that @xmath55 for the burst rate density , where @xmath56 is the minimum energy of grb sources in units of @xmath57 ergs , and the expression on the right - hand - side of this equation is valid when @xmath58 .",
    "the fit to the batse statistics is not sensitive to the value of @xmath59 when @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 , @xmath62 gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath6 .",
    "if grb 980425 is assumed to be associated with sn 1998bw , then the statistical model requires that @xmath63 . in this case , @xmath64 gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath6 , and most grbs have low energy and luminosity and are consequently not observed .",
    "the event rate is therefore very sensitive to the number of faint bursts which is not well - constrained by present data @xcite .",
    "beaming will increase the rate density of sources by the inverse of the mean beaming fraction compared to the isotropic value given here .",
    "the local energy emissivity of the sources of grbs , from equation ( [ ndot ] ) , is @xmath65 the average energy release per burst is just the ratio of equations ( [ dedvdt ] ) and ( [ dndvdt ] ) , and is equal to @xmath66 ergs and @xmath67 ergs when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "this does not correspond to the average energy release of _ detected _ grbs , because very energetic bursts are much more likely to be detected .",
    "one - half of the total energy generated by burst sources comes from events with energies @xmath70 ergs .",
    "this is a lower limit to the average energy of an event , because the use of a single power - law function for @xmath39 in equation ( [ ndot ] ) does not accurately model extremely powerful and very rare events , such as grb 990123 .",
    "consequently , equation ( [ dedvdt ] ) is a lower limit to the local emissivity determined by fits to batse data .",
    "this value is not sensitive to the choice for @xmath59 , which is required to be @xmath71 in the statistical study .",
    "thus the local volume - averaged grb energy emissivity is better known than the local grb event rate density .",
    "possible collimation of grb sources does not alter the energetics arguments made here as it does for the event rate calculation , because a smaller beaming fraction is offset by a larger number of sources .",
    "neither would beaming affect the efficiency calculations performed below .",
    "if grbs exhibit a constant energy reservoir @xcite , the implications for grb source emissivity in the statistical study of @xcite therefore remains unchanged , and in fact implies a distribution of jet opening angles @xmath72 for the sources of grbs ( @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 when @xmath75 . because the rate density of grb sources is inversely proportional to the beaming factor , the radiative signatures from a single grb would be changed due to beaming . throughout this paper ,",
    "we quote energy emissivities and event rates for uncollimated grb sources , but additionally consider the constant energy reservoir result when calculating the rate of grbs in the milky way .",
    "the statistical study of @xcite is seen to be consistent with other recent grb statistical studies once one recognizes that inefficiencies for generating radiation from the grb event and for detecting emission in the batse range have been explicitly taken into account in this approach ( this point was not considered by @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , most burst events with @xmath76 will not trigger a grb detector such as batse due to the triggering criteria and design of burst detectors that have been flown to date @xcite .",
    "these undetected dirty fireballs may contribute as much as 50 - 70% of the total emissivity .",
    "for example , @xcite derives a local emissivity of grbs in the 10 - 1000 kev band of @xmath77 ergs gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath6 , which is a factor 36 smaller than the value obtained here .",
    "the efficiency for the external shock model to produce radiation in the 10 - 1000 kev band is @xmath78 - 15% , and @xmath79% of the total energy is released in the form of dirty fireballs with @xmath76 that would not trigger batse .",
    "( the clean fireballs with @xmath80 can not be very numerous . )",
    "insofar as inefficiencies for generating @xmath15-ray emission in a colliding shell model are typically 1% or less @xcite , and that the collision of a relativistic shell with matter at rest allows the greatest fraction of directed kinetic energy to be dissipated within the blast wave shell @xcite , we think that equation ( [ dedvdt ] ) therefore provides a conservative lower estimate for the emissivity of progenitor sources of grbs in the local universe .    to obtain the emissivity of grb sources into the milky way galaxy ,",
    "we proceed in two ways .",
    "the first , following @xcite , is to employ the schechter luminosity function @xmath81 @xmath82@xmath83 @xmath84 , giving the number density of galaxies with luminosities in the range @xmath85 to @xmath86 . assuming that the burst emissivity per galaxy is proportional to the luminosity of the galaxy , then @xmath87 , so that @xmath88^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath89 is the gamma function .",
    "the energy released by grb progenitors in a galaxy with luminosity @xmath85 is @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 in the last term of equation ( [ de(l)dt ] ) , we used the results of equation ( [ dedvdt ] ) with @xmath92 mpc@xmath44 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "if the milky way is an @xmath95 galaxy , then the power of grb sources into the milky way is therefore @xmath96 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite argue that a better approach is to weight the burst emissivity by the ratio of the blue luminosity surface density @xmath97 of the milky way to the volume - averaged blue luminosity density @xmath98 of galaxies in the local universe . using the expressions @xmath99 pc@xmath100 and @xmath101 mpc@xmath44 quoted by @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath102 ergs pc@xmath100 yr@xmath6 for the burst power per unit area in the solar neighborhood .",
    "for a 15 kpc radius , we then obtain @xmath103 ergs s@xmath6 for the grb source power in the milky way , which is in good agreement with the value obtained through the first approach .",
    "an advantage of this method is to highlight the potentially large variations in the emissivity of grb sources in different regions of a galaxy .",
    "the power required to supply the galactic cosmic radiation , assuming that cosmic rays are uniformly distributed throughout the disk of the galaxy , is @xmath104 ergs s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we therefore see that grb sources and the dirty and clean fireballs , collectively referred to as fireball transients ( fts ) , supply a power to the milky way that is @xmath105% of the cosmic ray power , and may therefore make an appreciable contribution to cosmic ray production in the galaxy .",
    "the relative ft / cosmic - ray power could be much larger if the contribution of clean and dirty fireballs that are invisible to grb detectors @xcite is much larger than derived on the basis of the single power - law representation of the @xmath40- and @xmath39-distributions .",
    "this fraction would also be larger if the efficiency for the sources of grbs to generate @xmath15 rays is smaller than calculated in the external shock model used by @xcite .",

    "equation ( 6 ) should be considered an upper limit to the uhecr energy density , in view of the smaller flux of @xmath119 ev particles measured with the monocular hires fluorescence air shower experiment @xcite .",
    "ultra - high energy particles lose energy by adiabatic losses in the expanding universe , and by photo - hadron and photo - pair production on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the mean energy loss length @xmath120 due to these processes has been recently recalculated by @xcite .",
    "the loss length for @xmath121 ev protons is about 140 mpc , and this length is also consistent with their calculations of horizon distance within which 50% of the protons survive .",
    "the values of @xmath122 at @xmath123 ev defines the gzk radius insofar as the energy losses are dominated by photo - hadronic processes at these energies .",

    ". the volume - averaged rate at which astronomical sources produce @xmath26 ev particles in the local universe is therefore @xmath125 ergs @xmath126 ergs gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath6 , provided that uhecrs traverse roughly straight - line trajectories through intergalactic space .",
    "if uhecrs diffuse in the intergalactic magnetic field , then the source volume contributing to locally observed cosmic rays could be reduced , though with no significant change in the local uhecr intensity due to the better trapping of uhecrs in our vicinity .",
    "this value is @xmath127 times smaller than the emissivity given in equation ( [ dedvdt ] ) , so that in principle there is a sufficient amount of energy available in the sources of grbs to power the uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the initial energy of a fireball into uhecrs must , however , be very efficient .",
    "if nonthermal power - law distributions of particles are accelerated in the blast wave , as expected in simple treatments of fermi acceleration , then hard spectra with a nonthermal particle injection index @xmath128 place a large fraction of the nonthermal energy in the form of the highest energy particles .",

    "the net result is to reduce the sampling distance so that detecting the radio emission from a halo turns out again to be difficult . in the event of a very weak ( @xmath601 g ) halo magnetic field ,",
    "the reprocessing of the compton power into the synchrotron component could however improve radio detectability by moving @xmath539 to lower frequencies ( see section 5.3.2 ) . to take advantage of the good radio resolution ( the size of the radio halo for sources at @xmath11 ( @xmath602 mpc ) is on the order of a few arc - seconds )",
    "would require detection of @xmath603 cm@xmath107-@xmath604 hz@xmath605jy fields spread over a surface area of this extent .",
    "this is not yet feasible .",
    "the tradeoff between angular extent and sensitivity will be helped if radio techniques can yield cleaned images that are @xmath606 in extent .",
    "wherever the radio range proves to have the greatest capability ( probably for galaxies at a few tens of mpc ) , structure in the neutron - decay radio halo should be carefully sought .",
    "the advantage here is that to test the uhecr / grb hypothesis , _ every _ @xmath95 galaxy should have a diffuse neutron - decay radio halo , whether or not grb outflows are collimated .",
    "the very low - frequency ( @xmath607 mhz ) emission from neutron - decay halos persists around all @xmath95 galaxies , and forms part of the diffuse low - frequency radio background .",
    "whether detection of such halos is technically feasible with new - generation radio arrays ( e.g. , the planned low - frequency array lofar ) will require more study .",
    "returning now to the ultra - high energy gamma - ray regime , neither glast nor the ground - based air and water cherenkov telescopes operating or in development ( e.g. , whipple , milagro , hess , veritas ) can be expected to detect a compton @xmath2 halo . only under the most optimistic conditions of a highly luminous compton @xmath184-halo at @xmath608 ergs s@xmath6",

    "glast is @xmath79 times more sensitive than egret , which had a limiting sensitivity of @xmath609 few@xmath610 ergs cm@xmath100 s@xmath6 , as does whipple . this gives a sampling distance of @xmath611 kpc . with the seven - fold increase in limiting distance for glast , and with the improvement that will be achieved with the veritas array ,",
    "there remains a chance of detecting highly luminous compton @xmath184-halos from nearby galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "the search for direct synchrotron , and both direct and cascade @xmath15 radiation from neutron - decay halos predicted by the external shock model are at limits that challenge current radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath15-ray detector technology .",
    "the predicted weakness of the @xmath2-decay halos reflects the low neutron production efficiency in this model .",
    "the stronger neutrino and neutron production within the context of an internal shock scenario @xcite would imply neutron decay halos @xmath3 times brighter .",
    "however , because of the uncertainty in the brightness of a @xmath184-halo , the detection of neutron - decay halos at the level of @xmath612 ergs s@xmath6 around @xmath95 galaxies would not discriminate between internal and external shock models .",
    "radiation halos detected at the level of @xmath613-@xmath614 ergs s@xmath6 around @xmath95 galaxies would be inconsistent with an external shock scenario , but would require stong damping of the very energy neutron - decay proton energy in an internal shell model .",
    "the much stronger neutrino production in the internal shock model will also provide a clear discriminant between internal and external shock scenarios .",
    "as summarized in the introduction , observations indicate that grbs are associated with supernovae taking place in star - forming galaxies .",
    "statistical analyses within the external shock model show that progenitor sources of grbs inject a time- and space - averaged power @xmath615 ergs s@xmath6 into an @xmath95 galaxy .",
    "more general arguments also show that the power injected into the milky way by fireball transient sources with relativstic outflows is at the level of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is much smaller than the @xmath616 ergs s@xmath6 thought to be injected into the galaxy by sne of all types .",
    "it is also somewhat smaller than the galactic cosmic - ray luminosity of @xmath104 ergs s@xmath6 that is estimated to be required to power hadronic cosmic rays , depending on the assumed efficiency for accelerating hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "but the global cosmic - ray power estimate assumes that the locally observed cosmic - ray energy density is typical throughout the galaxy , and that temporal stochastic variations are not large .",
    "both of these assumptions could be wrong @xcite .",
    "the derived ft power is sufficiently close to suggest that the progenitor sources of grbs could power a significant fraction of the hadronic cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "we additionally note several difficulties for the conventional view that cosmic rays are accelerated by supernovae in the galaxy ( see @xcite for further detail ) : ( i ) spectral signatures of the hadronic cosmic - ray component associated with @xmath617 emission features , which carries @xmath618 - 100 times as much energy as the leptonic cosmic - ray component , have not been detected unambiguously in the vicinity of snrs @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the unidentified egret sources have not been firmly associated with snrs @xcite , and several candidate snrs are more likely to be associated with pulsars @xcite .",
    "( ii ) tev gamma rays are not detected from snrs at the level expected from hadronic acceleration in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the measured spectrum of the diffuse galactic @xmath15-ray background is harder than predicted if the locally measured cosmic - ray proton spectrum is typical of other places in the milky way @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the origin of cosmic rays at and above the knee of the cosmic - ray spectum and the smooth transition at the knee are difficult to explain with a sn shock model @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that cosmic rays originate from the subclass of sne that are progenitors of grbs .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite have also suggested that cosmic rays might be accelerated by the sources of grbs . ) how frequent are these events compared to other types of sne",
    "? we can evaluate this rate from the statistical study of @xcite , or by modifying this study in view of the constant energy reservoir result of @xcite .",

    "for the ft rate of @xmath62 gpc@xmath44 yr@xmath6 , which is the minimum rate necessary to fit the batse statistics within the external shock model , this implies a ft within the milky way @xmath640-@xmath641 yr@xmath6 , depending on the @xmath95 density .- like , are used in this paper .",

    "the event rate is very uncertain for weak grbs , but most of the energy comes from the rare strong grbs with @xmath315 ergs . if grbs are highly beamed , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , then grbs and fireball transients with @xmath650 ergs could occur as frequently as once every @xmath590-@xmath455 yrs in the galaxy .",
    "formulae for the nonthermal synchrotron emission spectra produced by an external shock were used to derive the comoving nonthermal synchrotron photon spectra in the blast wave .",
    "this radiation provides target photons for the very energetic nonthermal particles .",
    "neutrons , neutrinos , positrons , and pairs are formed as byproducts of @xmath15-p and @xmath15-ion interactions .",
    "neutron and neutrino production spectra and light curves formed in photomeson interactions are readily derived in the external shock model .",
    "the neutrino flux from individual grbs is far too weak to be detected by km@xmath107 neutrino detectors , because most of the energy is carried by relatively few , very energetic neutrinos .",
    "grbs might still contribute the major fraction of the diffuse neutrino background for neutrinos with energies @xmath651 ev .",
    "the energy carried away by neutrons from very energetic grbs with @xmath652 will exceed 1% of the total energy ; reverse shock emission giving enhanced target photons could make the neutron - production efficiency even larger , though ssc processes might reduce it .",

    "the halo size is @xmath653 kpc , where @xmath654 is the lorentz factor of the neutrons that carry most of the energy from the grb .",
    "the shortest halo emission lifetime from a single grb is @xmath655 yrs . the peak luminosity of a @xmath2 halo from a single smooth - profile grb is @xmath656 ergs s@xmath6 .",

    ", it might also be technically feasible to detect these halos at x - ray and @xmath15-ray energies .",
    "the subtraction of the light from the bright central galaxy is a major obstacle to halo detection at optical frequencies .",
    "approximately @xmath657% of @xmath95 galaxies should display a @xmath2 halo from a single grb near the peak of its luminosity output for unbeamed grbs .",

    "the average bolometric neutron - decay @xmath2 halo emission surrounding an @xmath95 galaxy is @xmath579 ergs s@xmath6 from smooth - profile fireball transients , but could be greater for grbs occurring in inhomogeneous surroundings .",
    "the emissivity of the progenitor sources of grbs in our galaxy potentially provides a large fraction of the luminosity required to power the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "if cosmic rays are accelerated by the supernovae that collapse to form a grb , about 1 out of @xmath309 - 100 supernova remnants in the galaxy should have harbored a grb , so that detection of a strong hadronic signature from a subset of supernovae should support this model for the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "in addition to the search for grb neutron - decay radiation halos around galaxies , further progress on these problems will be achieved by searching for neutrino emission from grbs .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from smooth profile grbs would probably rule out the external shock model for the prompt phase of grbs .",

    "<S> the hypothesis that ultra - high energy ( @xmath0 ev ) cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are accelerated by gamma - ray burst ( grb ) blast waves is assumed to be correct . </S>",
    "<S> implications of this assumption are then derived for the external shock model of gamma - ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the evolving synchrotron radiation spectrum in grb blast waves provides target photons for the photomeson production of neutrinos and neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> decay characteristics and radiative efficiencies of the neutral particles that escape from the blast wave are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse high - energy grb neutrino background and the distribution of high - energy grb neutrino events are calculated for specific parameter sets , and a scaling relation for the photomeson production efficiency in surroundings with different densities is derived .    </S>",
    "<S> grbs provide an intense flux of high - energy neutrons , with neutron - production efficiencies exceeding @xmath1% of the total energy release . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative characteristics of the neutron @xmath2-decay electrons from the grb  neutron bomb \" are solved in a special case . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with grb activity should be surrounded by radiation halos of @xmath3 kpc extent from the outflowing neutrons , consisting of a nonthermal optical / x - ray synchrotron component and a high - energy gamma - ray component from compton - scattered microwave background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the peak luminosity emitted by the diffuse @xmath2-electron halo from a single grb with @xmath4 ergs isotropic energy release is @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , with a potentially much brighter signal from the neutron - decay protons . </S>",
    "<S> the decay halo from a single grb can persist for @xmath7 - 1 myr . </S>",
    "<S> stronger neutrino fluxes and neutron decay halos can be produced by external shocks in clumpy external media and in scenarios involving internal shock scenarios , so detection of neutrinos associated with smooth - profile grbs could rule out an implusive grb central engine and an external shock model for the prompt phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of sources of grbs and relativistic outflows in l@xmath8 galaxies such as the milky way is at the level of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is sufficient to account for uhecr generation by grbs . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly speculate on the possibility that hadronic cosmic rays originate from the subset of supernovae that collapse to form relativistic outflows and grbs . </S>"
