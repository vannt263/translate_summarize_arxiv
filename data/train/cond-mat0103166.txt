    "@xcite the maximum dephasing times were found to be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude _ bigger _ as compared to those in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , @xmath36 for the silver sample @xcite was about an order of magnitude higher than that for the copper sample @xcite with similar ( although _ not _ identical ) parameters .",
    "observing this difference the authors @xcite suggested that the low temperature saturation of @xmath0 in disordered metal wires can not be universal and can be material dependent .",
    "for our comparison we will use the data for 8 samples @xcite with nominally identical resistivity @xmath41 @xmath42 cm and @xmath43 m@xmath44/sek ( samples c to f and h to k ) , 2 samples @xcite ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and one sample ( @xmath47 ) @xcite . since all the maximum dephasing times @xcite were nearly the same , for the sake of brevity we only quote an average value for @xmath36 obtained by averaging over samples c to f and h to k. in order to estimate @xmath4 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 samples we used the parameters given in the table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . experimentally observed values of @xmath36 and our theoretical predictions for @xmath4 ( eq . ( [ 3d ] ) with @xmath48 ) are summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement appears to be even much better than one could possibly expect given all experimental and theoretical uncertainties in determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that our theoretical predictions presented in both above tables involve * no fit parameters*. previously @xcite we already reported on a similar agreement with the results @xcite .",
    "all these observations strongly favour the conclusion about _ universality _ of the low temperature saturation of @xmath0 in disordered conductors .    to complete this issue we mention that also our @xmath25 and @xmath26 expressions for the maximum dephasing time @xcite give correct order - of - magnitude estimates for @xmath0 for the above samples .",
    "for instance , for @xmath26 samples @xcite the second eq .",
    "( [ 1d2d ] ) yields ( for @xmath49 ) @xmath50 sek .",
    "this estimate is only @xmath51 times smaller than the experimental values .",
    "again , although such an accuracy is already more than sufficient , the remaining difference can easily be removed simply by choosing @xmath52 .    for comparison ,",
    "the authors @xcite estimated the value of @xmath0 which follows from the theory @xcite for their @xmath26 samples as @xmath53 sek at @xmath54 . at the lowest measurement temperature",
    "@xmath55 mk this estimate translates into @xmath0 in the range @xmath56 sek which is @xmath57 orders of magnitude bigger than the values measured in ref .",

    "@xmath58      where @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "an essential difference between this result and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in our case the temperature - independent contribution to the dephasing rate @xmath61 is not equal to zero . if one neglects this contribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) would immediately yield the standard result @xcite @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , in quasi-@xmath26 samples one gets @xcite @xmath63 . in order to test these predictions",
    "it is appropriate to present experimental data for @xmath6 on a log - log plot , exactly as it was done in refs .",
    "@xcite . from ref .",
    "@xcite one expects ( @xmath64 ) to observe straight lines with the slope becoming _ steeper _ as one crosses over from quasi-@xmath25 to quasi-@xmath26 systems and ( @xmath65 ) for two quasi-@xmath25 samples with the same @xmath29 and @xmath30 but with different cross - sections @xmath66 the straight lines corresponding to @xmath67-dependence of @xmath0 should be _",
    "parallel_.    none of these two features was observed in the experiments @xcite . just on the contrary , the opposite trend was detected : in all cases the slope of the curves _ decreased _ with increasing sample width @xmath21 ( see fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the curves for quasi-@xmath25 samples with different @xmath21 were _ not _ parallel ( actually the data points for the sample f on fig .",
    "3 of @xcite clearly saturate and can hardly be fitted to a straight line at all ) and , on top of that , the @xmath68-dependence of the decoherence rate for quasi-@xmath26 samples  instead of being linear in @xmath68  was very weak already at @xmath69 .",
    "now let us see if these features can be accounted for within our theory . since the low temperature behavior of @xmath0 predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from a power - law one @xcite it appears to be more useful to replot the same data on a linear scale .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) at sufficiently low @xmath68 one expects to observe a linear dependence of the decoherence rate on @xmath68 shifted upwards by the value @xmath61 .",
    "for the same parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( and the same @xmath4 ) the slope @xmath70 for quasi-@xmath25 samples should depend only on the cross section @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath21 for the sample @xmath71 was reported in @xcite to be 4 times larger than for the samples a to e , one expects @xmath70 to be 4 times _ smaller _ for the sample f.    the experimental data for the samples a , b and f @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "1 . we observe that ( @xmath72 ) the dephasing rate @xmath73 increases linearly with @xmath68 , ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath75 these linear dependencies extrapolate to a _ nonzero _",
    "( and practically the same ) value @xmath73 for all three samples and ( @xmath76 ) the slope @xmath70 is indeed about 4 times smaller for the sample @xmath71 as compared to the samples a and b. all these features are fully consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the slope is several ( @xmath77 ) times larger than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) .",
    "the origin of this difference is not clear to us at the moment , but possibly it can be due to non - uniformity of the wires . the data for quasi-@xmath26 samples i and k @xcite also show the trend qualitatively consistent with our eq . ( [ sum ] ) .",
    "also in that case the temperature effect seems to be more pronounced than it is predicted within our theory .",
    "now we will address the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig 3 .",
    "of @xcite the authors presented their data for @xmath78 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 samples with similar parameters .",
    "both the magnitude and the temperature dependence of @xmath0 differ drastically for these three samples .",
    "this observation led the authors @xcite to conclude that the behavior of @xmath0 and , in particular , its saturation at low @xmath68 may be material dependent .",
    "later it was demonstrated by the same group @xcite that unusually low values of @xmath0 in gold @xcite were most likely due to high concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "a pure gold sample ( @xmath47 ) was fabricated and similar behavior of @xmath0 was observed @xcite as previously for @xmath45 sample @xcite : @xmath0 did not saturate down to @xmath79 mk on a log - log plot . at the same time",
    "it was confirmed @xcite that also very pure @xmath46 samples showed saturation similarly to an earlier @xmath46 sample @xcite .",
    "the material dependence of @xmath0 can not be ruled out in general .",
    "however , with minimum efforts one can demonstrate that _ no material dependence _ needs to be assumed in order to quantitatively explain seemingly different behavior of @xmath45 ( no saturation down to @xmath80 mk ) and @xmath46 ( clear saturation already at @xmath81 mk ) samples @xcite .",
    "let us rescale eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) as @xmath82 where we introduced dimensionless variables @xmath83 here @xmath84 both for @xmath46 and @xmath45 samples provided one performs the scaling to the values @xmath4 and @xmath85 calculated for the respective sample .",
    "the temperature @xmath85 sets the scale at which thermal and quantum contributions to the dephasing rate become comparable . making use of the parameter values for @xmath46 and @xmath45 samples one finds @xmath86 note , that this estimate is not sensitive to various ambiguities related , e.g. , to the cutoff parameter @xmath16 .",
    "( [ ts ] ) just follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) , ( [ eq1d ] ) for the values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 presented in the table 1 of ref .",
    "the estimate ( [ ts ] ) remains unchanged if , instead of our eq .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) , one uses experimental values for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "hence , the temperature range where quantum effects set in can easily vary by one order of magnitude or more for different samples even if their macroscopic parameters are similar @xcite .",
    "what remains is to make both log - log and linear scale plots of eq .",
    "( [ besr2 ] ) , see fig .",
    "2 . in these plots",
    "we scaled both curves to the parameters of one ( @xmath46 ) sample , i.e. @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "making use of the values for @xmath36 @xcite we find @xmath90 mk and @xmath91 mk .",
    "these numbers as well as the temperature dependence of @xmath0 are in the agreement with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "e.g. on the log - log plot we observe that , while @xmath46 sample shows clear saturation around @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath93 mk ) , practically no signs of saturation are visible for @xmath45 sample even at temperatures one order of magnitude lower .",
    "similar analysis can be performed , e.g. , for @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath47 @xcite samples ( cf .",
    "right panel of fig . 7 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in that case",
    "one can estimate @xmath95 .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) that by a proper choice of the sample parameters one can tune the effective temperature range at which saturation feature occurs on the log - log plot .",
    "e.g. _ thinner _ samples with identical other parameters will show no saturation down to _",
    "lower _ temperatures .",
    "the lack of saturation for such samples even at relatively low @xmath68 would , of course , _ not _ imply that the electron dephasing rate is zero at @xmath2 .",
    "let us replot the `` non - saturating '' data @xcite on a linear scale . in fig .",
    "3 we collected the data points for different samples studied in different experiments ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath94 of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath45 of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath47 of ref .",
    "all these samples show essentially _ the same _ behavior at low temperatures . both the slope @xmath70 and the values @xmath4 slightly differ from sample to sample , but these differences are unimportant and can easily be accounted for by different values of @xmath30 and @xmath66 as well as by measurement uncertainties .",
    "much more importantly , at low temperatures @xmath73 depends _ linearly _ on @xmath68 and clearly extrapolates to a _ nonzero _",
    "value for all the samples presented in fig .",
    "this is exactly what one expects from our eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) . also the similarity with the results @xcite ( our fig .",
    "1 ) is quite obvious .    in summary",
