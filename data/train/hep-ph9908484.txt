    "the operator - product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , @xmath2 represents the product @xmath3 of two local operators as a combination , with _",
    "c_-number coefficients , of the local operators @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the total four - momentum of the system considered and @xmath6 .",
    "the singularities of the product are contained in the coefficient functions @xmath7 , which are ordered according to the increasing exponent @xmath8 in @xmath9 .    in local quantum field theory ,",
    "the product @xmath10 of two or several field operators is singular for coinciding arguments , and the problem of defining it in a neighbourhood is of fundamental importance .",
    "k. wilson proposed that the operator product may be expanded in the form @xmath11 where the remainder @xmath12 vanishes in the limit @xmath13 while the functions @xmath14 become singular or non - vanishing .",
    "he also generalized his hypothesis by assuming @xcite that any operator product may be represented as a series @xmath15 which is asymptotic in the sense that to every @xmath16 there exists a @xmath17 such that the coefficients @xmath18 vanish faster than @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "a rigorous formulation of the operator - product expansion within perturbation theory has been worked out by zimmermann @xcite .",
    "the wilson relation can be justified order by order in perturbation theory , and there is a well - defined algorithm allowing one to calculate the coefficient functions .",
    "zimmermann , wilson and otterson @xcite show how an operator product expansion can be derived from general principles , and find conditions under which the ope gives complete information on the short - distance behaviour of operator products .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "@xcite examine how the form of the operator - product expansion depends on the symmetry group of the theory .",
    "they find for instance that the covariance under the spinor group su(2,2 ) can place significant restrictions on the structure of the expansion terms on the light cone .    in momentum space ,",
    "the minkowski region lies along the cut @xmath21 carrying the spectrum of physical states , while in the euclidean region ( @xmath22 ) the expansion is , for large @xmath23 , determined by short - distance dynamics , the separation of the large - distance contributions from the short - distance ones being well defined @xcite .",
    "predictions in the minkowski region are obtained by analytic continuation .",
    "the operator product expansion has been applied to various problems in quantum theory with varying degree of rigour . according to the problem considered ,",
    "different mathematical properties of the expansion have been proved or assumed ( also the symbol @xmath24 in ( [ opeq ] ) is understood differently in different contexts ) . at a fixed perturbative order",
    ", one can express the operator product in terms of the feynman diagrams of this order .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the large - momentum expansion has a non - vanishing convergence radius .",
    "smirnov @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) proved asymptotic expansions of the renormalized feynman amplitudes in the large - momentum ( mass ) limit , and found the corresponding operator expansions for the s - matrix and composite operators .    in quantum chromodynamics , a theory with a strong non - perturbative component , very little is known about the mathematical character of the operator - product expansion and its exact composition . in particular , it is not known whether terms exponential in the variable @xmath25 , for instance terms of the form @xcite @xmath26 with @xmath27 positive , have to be added to describe strong - interaction processes .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the series is divergent , but it is not known whether it is asymptotic to the function searched for and , if so , in what region of the @xmath23 plane .",
    "we can expect that there is more chance to trust ( [ opeq ] ) at higher energies than at low energies ; but the large - order behaviour of its terms is not known @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lack of rigour , the operator - product expansion in qcd is very much needed as a tool for solving a number of practical problems , such as the semileptonic b - meson decay , heavy - light quark systems , heavy quarkonia and the drell - yan process .",
    "the inclusive decay hadronic widths are also expected to be calculable using the ope and analyticity .    to apply the operator product expansion in qcd , one is of course faced with the problem of extending it to non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "this issue has been discussed since the development of the qcd sum rules @xcite , where ope is combined with analyticity and other non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "the successful application of the qcd sum rule technique to many processes and effects is well known .",
    "secondly , some information about the behaviour of the operator product expansion in the complex @xmath23 plane away from euclidean region , along all rays passing through the origin , is necessary .",
    "the reason is that the feynman graphs , through which the observables ( including those describing high - energy effects ) are expressed , contain integration over small momenta , where there is little chance that the ope can be applied . using the analyticity property , however",
    ", one can replace the low - energy integral by that along a circle of a sufficiently large radius in the complex plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     plane , showing how analyticity is used to replace an integral along the cut by that along a circle . for the decay of the @xmath1 lepton ( see section 3 ) , the radius is equal to its mass @xmath28 squared.,width=302 ]    this , however , poses a new problem , that of finding conditions under which an expansion of the type @xmath29 can be extended to the complex @xmath23 plane , to be valid along all rays @xmath30 .",
    "such an extension is a delicate problem requiring precise mathematical conditions , which are not known in the case of qcd . to make the problem well - defined",
    ", recourse to simplifying mathematical assumptions therefore seems necessary .",
    "while wilson s operator product expansion is originally formulated in the euclidean domain , its applications are mostly related to quantities of the minkowski nature .",
    "then , the assumption is usually adopted @xcite that the `` convergence properties '' of the operator - product expansion away from the euclidean ray @xmath31 are the same as those along it , except the points of the cut @xmath32 ( the minkowski region ) . simultaneously , it is assumed that the truncation error ( caused by approximating the operator product by several terms of the expansion ) is _ independent _ of the direction in the complex @xmath23 plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    we consider this assumption too a severe simplification , in addition technically motivated : indeed , it is hard to believe that the unknown discontinuity along the cut would have no influence on the behaviour of the function along rays that are near the cut .    in the present paper",
    "we therefore look for a model scheme that would not a priori exclude the possibility that the bound on the truncation error ( assumed originally in euclidean region ) becomes looser with increasing deflection from the positive real semiaxis .",
    "the program of the paper was sketched in our previous papers , see @xcite and @xcite : we discuss conditions under which an expansion of the type ( [ approx ] ) can be extended to angles away from the euclidean semiaxis in the complex @xmath23 plane , with the aim to find how a bound , originally assumed to be valid along the positive real semiaxis , develops when the deflection increases and the cut is approached .",
    "we propose ( in section 2 of the present paper ) a scheme that ( _ i _ ) has precise mathematical meaning , ( _ ii _ ) is free from the _ a priori _ assumption that the influence of the cut on the truncation error along a general ray can be neglected and , simultaneously , ( _ iii _ ) tries to keep the model possibly close to real situations .",
    "to illustrate the physical interest of such a problem , we discuss in section 3 the determination of the coupling constant from the @xmath1 lepton hadronic width .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in section 4 . in the concluding section 5",
    "we summarize our results , and discuss several possibilities of refining the scheme to get closer to physical reality .",
    "the three appendices contain the proof of the main theorem on which our results are based , and an example of a function that saturates the bound ( [ vra3 ] ) obtained in the appendix a.",
    "let @xmath33 be holomorphic in @xmath34 , the complex @xmath35 plane ( @xmath36 ) cut along @xmath37 $ ] from which a bounded domain around the origin may be removed .",
    "let the constants @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and a positive number @xmath40 exist such that the following inequality @xmath41 is satisfied for a positive integer @xmath42 and all @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being a positive number .",
    "( to avoid unnecessary complications , we take the lowest value of @xmath8 to be zero , assuming that terms that are infinite at @xmath45 have been removed . ) the problem is what inequality ( if any ) will hold along rays in the complex @xmath35 plane , away from the negative real semiaxis ( euclidean region ) .    as is natural to expect",
    ", the answer depends on additional assumptions imposed on the function @xmath46 . when compared with the problem of the operator - product expansion in qcd , we make the following extra assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath38 of local operators are perturbative series in powers of the qcd coupling constant @xmath47 , which in turn is expanded in negative powers of @xmath48 with coefficient functions depending on @xmath49 , etc . here , @xmath50 is @xmath51 , the fundamental scale of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "it is sometimes instructive to consider the form of the power corrections in the case that the logarithmic @xmath23-dependence of the coefficient functions is neglected .",
    "we make this approximation for simplicity in the present paper , with the aim to examine the general case in a later publication .",
    "( in this approximation , the cut due to the logarithmic dependence of the wilson coefficients disappears , but @xmath33 can still have a cut if the expansion has an infinite number of terms or if additional singular terms are added to the series , see below . )",
    "we assume that the inequality ( [ v2 ] ) is valid up to @xmath52 , where the right - hand side of ( [ v2 ] ) vanishes at a high rate .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the @xmath42-th order remainder @xmath53 , @xmath54 tends to zero for @xmath55 as the @xmath42-th power of @xmath56 for at least one value of @xmath42 . and @xmath57 . ]",
    "these two assumptions simplify our problem but they may move us farther from physics .",
    "we plan to refine the scheme in a subsequent paper ; our principal intention here is to create a model which would be free from the conventional assumption that the truncation error is the same in all directions ( except the cut ) .    in phenomenological applications , the starting estimate of the truncation error in euclidean region",
    "is usually taken to be of the order of the first neglected term of the expansion .",
    "this term serves as a pragmatic guidance in estimating the size of the error ; then , its value is conventionally extended to be the estimate of the truncation error along all rays passing through the origin .",
    "it is our aim to obtain a more realistic picture about how the error may develop when the cut is approached .",
    "we examine the high - energy properties of the expansion ( [ approx ] ) along different rays in the complex plane . assuming the bound ( [ v2 ] ) for @xmath43",
    ", we observe how it varies with increasing deflection of the ray from euclidean region .",
    "note that we do not demand that the expansion ( [ approx ] ) be convergent or asymptotic to the expanded function @xmath58 : our approach is more general and can be applied whenever the remainder @xmath59 obeys ( [ v2 ] ) at least for _ one fixed _ value of @xmath42 ,",
    "i.e. , tends to zero as @xmath60 or faster in the euclidean domain .",
    "this allows , under the conditions specified below , an analytic continuation of the truncation error from the euclidean to the minkowski domain .",
    "if the starting inequality ( [ v2 ] ) is known for _ several _ values of @xmath42 , one can perform the continuation for each of them , term by term .",
    "recent applications of the operator product expansion in qcd have focused on problems dealing with quantities that are essentially related to the minkowski domain , where the properties of the ope are least known and may be completely different from those in the euclidean domain .",
    "inclusive decays of heavy flavours have been discussed .",
    "the t hooft model @xcite of two - dimensional qcd in the limit of many colours has been considered , @xcite , with the aim to abstract general features that may survive in four - dimensional qcd .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers quoted for details . here",
    "let us briefly discuss the example of the determination of @xmath61 from the @xmath1 lepton hadronic width , to illustrate physical relevance of the problem .",
    "the @xmath1 lepton occupies a special position among all leptons , being the only lepton heavy enough to decay into hadrons .",
    "the @xmath1 decay provides a unique chance to study hadronic weak interactions at moderate energies .",
    "there has been extensive interest in using measurements of its total hadronic decay width @xmath63 ( normalized to the leptonic width ) , @xmath64}{\\gamma[\\tau^{- } \\rightarrow   \\nu_{\\tau}{\\rm e}^{-}\\bar{\\nu}_{\\rm e } ] } , \\label{rta1}\\ ] ] to extract the renormalized strong - coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity possesses a number of advantages compared with other qcd observables .",
    "it is expected to be calculable in qcd using analyticity and the operator product expansion .",
    "it is an inclusive quantity which has been calculated perturbatively to the order @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath1 mass , big as it is , is nevertheless below the threshold for charmed hadron production .",
    "starting from analyticity and the operator product expansion braaten , narison and pich @xcite used the measurements of the @xmath1 decay rate to determine the qcd running coupling constant at the scale of the @xmath1 mass @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio @xmath63 is represented in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a combination of correlators @xmath68 , @xmath69 corresponding to the two - point correlation functions for the vector @xmath70 and axial vector @xmath71 colour singlet massless quark currents , with coefficients given by the elements @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix , the subscripts @xmath74u , d , s denoting light quark flavours .",
    "for instance , @xmath75 the integral ( [ rta2 ] ) can not at present be calculated from qcd , because the hadronic functions are sensitive to the non - perturbative effects confining quarks in hadrons .",
    "but one can make use of the analyticity property of the correlating functions in the complex @xmath35-plane cut along the positive real semiaxis .",
    "this allows one to express ( [ rta2 ] ) as a contour integral along the circle of radius @xmath76 : @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "1 , showing how analyticity is used to obtain @xmath63 from ( [ rtau ] ) ) . while in ( [ rta2 ] )",
    "the integration path @xmath78 runs along the cut , the integration contour in ( [ rtau ] ) keeps distance from it ( with the exception of one point , @xmath79 , and its neighbourhood ) , thereby giving a justification for representing @xmath67 as the operator - product expansion over local operators ( provided that the value of @xmath28 is large enough , see a discussion in @xcite ) .    in an analogous way , other weighted integrals ( moments ) of @xmath80 , @xmath81",
    "have approximately been calculated within the framework of qcd .",
    "these moments can also be expressed as contour integrals analogous to ( [ rtau ] ) .",
    "it is to be expected that the error brought about by truncating the operator - product expansion of @xmath67 will be larger along rays that are closer to the cut @xmath82 .",
    "there is in particular a special danger that the integral ( [ rtau ] ) receives essential contributions from an interval around @xmath79 , where the ope has little chance appropriately to represent the function expanded .",
    "a fortunate circumstance is that the double zero of the kinematic factor @xmath83 in the integrand suppresses the contribution from this dangerous segment .",
    "but a quantitative analysis of this argument is , to the best of our knowledge , still lacking .",
    "moreover , as is emphasized in @xcite , experimental data are , because of the same factor @xmath83 , very poor and statistically limited around this point .",
    "an explicit estimate of the error is therefore desirable .",
    "it is our aim to develop a scheme allowing a quantitative analysis of this qualitative argument .",
    "the method of obtaining the value of @xmath0 from @xmath63 was repeatedly criticised in the literature @xcite for various reasons , claiming that the theoretical uncertainty usually quoted is underestimated .",
    "leaving aside uncertainties related to the truncation of the perturbation series , we focus on two aspects related to the truncation of the operator product expansion .",
    "these aspects are :    \\1 .",
    "the integral in ( [ rtau ] ) is carried out along the circle @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath67 in the integrand is approximated by the truncated ope series , how does the remainder depend on the direction of the ray in the complex @xmath35 plane ?",
    "one rightly expects that the error will increase with @xmath35 getting closer to the cut .",
    "but the quantitative aspect of this statement is unclear .",
    "how reliable is the expansion at those points @xmath85 that are far from the euclidean interval , yet not quite close to the double zero at @xmath86 ?",
    "the terms exponential in @xmath87 , possibly to be added to the operator product expansion , are small along the euclidean ray and invisible in the truncated series , but may become big when the ray in the @xmath35 plane approaches the cut in the minkowski domain .",
    "how does the effect of such additional terms depend on the deflection from euclidean region ?    in the subsequent sections , we discuss these problems by examining the mathematical model outlined in sec .",
    "we find conditions for obtaining bounds on the truncation errors in the whole complex high - energy domain ; it turns out that these bounds are larger ( and die off slower ) in the minkowski domain than in the euclidean domain .",
    "according to the notation introduced in sec . 2 , @xmath88 represents a function holomorphic in a disk centred at the origin of the complex @xmath56 plane cut along the negative real semiaxis .",
    "we consider two generic assumption schemes :    _ case i _ : let us assume that @xmath88 has the form of the generalized stieltjes integral ( see @xcite ) @xmath89 and that the moments @xmath90 exist for @xmath91 , with @xmath42 being a fixed positive integer and @xmath92 a real - valued function .",
    "then , assuming a bound on the remainder ( [ rem ] ) in euclidean region , we obtain a bound along all rays ( see the formulae ( [ bors5 ] ) and ( [ vr3 ] ) ) .",
    "_ case ii _ : the integral representation ( [ bors1 ] ) is not a dispersion relation , because the function @xmath92 has to vanish very rapidly for the moments @xmath38 ( [ bors2 ] ) to exist . beside this , non - power - like terms added to the operator - product expansion may violate the conditions ( [ bors1 ] ) , ( [ bors2 ] ) .",
    "we therefore build in subsection 4.2 a framework for more general situations , assuming an overall constant bound on @xmath93 .",
    "then , using ( [ v2 ] ) on @xmath93 along the euclidean ray , we obtain an angle - dependent bound along all rays ( see the formula ( [ vrk3 ] ) or ( [ vrk4 ] ) ) , and observe how it deteriorates when the ray deflects from euclidean to the minkowski region .",
    "the result ( [ vrk3 ] ) , ( [ vrk4 ] ) is based on theorem a of appendix a.    in either case , the bounds obtained can not be improved unless the respective class of functions is reduced to a smaller one .",
    "we show this by giving examples of functions saturating them in subsection 4.1 and in the appendix c respectively .",
    "let us first assume that ( [ bors1 ] ) and ( [ bors2 ] ) hold with @xmath92 nonnegative for @xmath94 .",
    "the remainders @xmath95 with @xmath96 , are bounded , for @xmath56 approaching zero along the positive real semiaxis , by @xmath97 where we use the notation @xmath98 it is easily seen that the inequality ( [ bors5 ] ) is valid also for @xmath56 approaching zero along any ray lying in the right half of the complex plane because @xmath99 and @xmath100 for re@xmath101 .",
    "this , however , is not the case for re @xmath102 , due to the presence of the cut in this halfplane .",
    "the following bound can be obtained for re@xmath103 .",
    "we have , denoting @xmath104 , @xmath105 considered as a function of @xmath106 at @xmath107 and @xmath108 fixed ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 has its maximum at @xmath111 , where its value is @xmath112 . in this way we obtain ( [ bors5 ] ) and @xmath113 for re@xmath114 and re@xmath115 respectively . comparing ( [ vr3 ] ) with ( [ bors5 ] )",
    ", we see how the factor @xmath112 makes the estimate looser when the ray gets closer to the cut , i.e. , when @xmath116 .",
    "the estimates become worse if the discontinuity along the cut is not positive definite .",
    "the corresponding bounds can be obtained by replacing @xmath92 with @xmath117 in the derivation .",
    "better bounds on @xmath118 than ( [ bors5 ] ) and ( [ vr3 ] ) can not be obtained unless some special assumptions about @xmath92 are made . to see this ,",
    "choose @xmath119 such that @xmath88 has a pole , @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , in which case @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "while the bound ( [ bors5 ] ) for re@xmath126 is saturated for @xmath127 tending to zero , ( [ vr3 ] ) for re@xmath115 is saturated for @xmath128 .",
    "it is of interest to see how the bounds ( [ bors5 ] ) and ( [ vr3 ] ) on the truncation error may affect the accuracy of the determination of the generic contour integral ( [ rtau ] ) . as was discussed above ,",
    "( [ bors5 ] ) and ( [ vr3 ] ) are not immediately applicable in qcd to estimate the truncation error , due to the simplifying assumptions of our model .",
    "but it is interesting to compare them with the conventional assumption that the error is constant in all directions of the complex @xmath56 plane , which is a cruder approximation . to see this",
    "let us examine how the factor @xmath129 in ( [ vr3 ] ) affects the estimate of the integrals of the form ( [ rtau ] ) .",
    "as we have neglected the logarithmic dependence of the coefficient functions , the integral ( [ rtau ] ) can be evaluated trivially using cauchy s residue theorem . representing the integration variable @xmath35 in the form @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and replacing the function @xmath67 by the bound ( [ bors5 ] ) ,",
    "( [ vr3 ] ) on @xmath132 , we obtain the following bound on the integrated remainder : @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 corresponds to the euclidean and the minkowskian halfplane respectively .",
    "the effect by which the discontinuity along the cut tells on the value of the truncation error can be seen when the sum @xmath136 is compared with @xmath137 where @xmath138 in which the integrand does not contain the factor @xmath139 .",
    "the three integrals can be written in the form @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath142 respectively , where @xmath143    we see that ( [ bound ] ) is composed of two factors , @xmath144 ( which depends on the @xmath8-th moment @xmath38 and on the radius @xmath145 of the integration circle ) , and @xmath146 ( which contains the factor @xmath139 ) .",
    "certainly , @xmath147 , which fact signals the zero of the denominator in ( [ bors4 ] ) .",
    "while @xmath148 is a divergent integral , @xmath149 turns out to be greater than @xmath150 by almost 24 per cent .",
    "this difference is 6.7 per cent for @xmath151 and further decreases with increasing @xmath152 , but increases with increasing @xmath153 at fixed @xmath152 .",
    "details can be seen in table 1 .",
    ".the ratio @xmath154 for different values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the ratio indicates how much the discontinuity along the cut affects the role of the truncation error in the integral @xmath155 when compared with @xmath156 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the constant @xmath157 in ( [ vrk1 ] ) affects the value of the integral bound ( [ rta2 ] ) in combination with the damping factor @xmath158 in the integrand of ( [ rta3 ] ) , which becomes small when @xmath42 increases and/or @xmath159 decreases .",
    "it is instructive to compare the resulting bound @xmath160 with that based on the assumption that ( [ vrk2 ] ) preserves its form in the whole cut disk .",
    "a convenient way to measure this effect is to divide @xmath160 by @xmath161 , in which the angle - dependent factor @xmath158 in the integrand is suppressed , the exponent @xmath162 being replaced by its value along the euclidean ray , @xmath163 . by this , ( [ vrk2 ] )",
    "is extended onto the whole cut disk .",
    "the resulting ratio is equal to @xmath164 ; some numbers are given in table 3 to illustrate the effect .",
    "while table 2 shows what improvement of ( [ vrk1 ] ) is achieved thanks to ( [ vrk2 ] ) and the theorem 1 , table 3 shows how strong the standard assumption of an overall validity of ( [ vrk2 ] ) is . out of the three bounds",
    ", @xmath165 is the most restrictive one , while our result @xmath160 based on the theorem 1 is looser ( as is shown in table 3 ) , and @xmath166 based on ( [ vrk1 ] ) is the loosest ( as is seen from table 2 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath167    the efficiency of our bound depends on the value of @xmath159 , the ratio of @xmath168 ( the lowest value of @xmath169 at which the bound ( [ vrk1 ] ) is supposed to hold ) to @xmath76 ( the radius of the integration contour of ( [ rtau ] ) in fig .",
    "clearly , the problem has sense only for @xmath170 , when the integration contour lies in the analyticity region .",
    "if the input bounds ( [ vrk1 ] ) and ( [ vrk2 ] ) are valid down to very low energies ( i.e. , if @xmath168 is small with respect to @xmath76 ) , @xmath159 will be small and the right - hand side of ( [ vrk3 ] ) will become small as well , thanks to the factor @xmath158 .",
    "this improving factor is , however , strongly angle - dependent in the complex @xmath35 plane and will eventually , near the cut , rise to unity , thereby raising the bound ( [ vrk3 ] ) back to the starting inequality ( [ vrk1 ] ) at the points of the cut .",
    "these results will be modified when the logarithmic dependence of the coefficient functions @xmath171 is taken into account .",
    "it has been our aim to propose a framework allowing a quantitative estimate of the truncation error of the operator - product expansion away from euclidean region . in considering the evaluation of the contour integrals of the type ( [ rta2 ] , [ rtau ] ) or ( [ hmom ] ) ,",
    "we have proposed two different sets of model assumptions to estimate the influence of the cut @xmath172 on the truncation error along different rays in the complex @xmath35 plane . in either case , the starting relation is the inequality ( [ v2 ] ) for negative @xmath35 , @xmath173 . when combined with analyticity , ( [ v2 ] ) can be extended into the complex @xmath35 plane , but additional assumptions are necessary .",
    "we have cosidered two sets of them , ( [ bors1 ] ) , ( [ bors2 ] ) ( see case i of section 4 ) , and ( [ vrk1 ] ) ( see case ii ) .",
    "the assumptions are rather strong in both cases , but are weaker than a straightforward extension of the inequality ( [ v2 ] ) into the @xmath35 plane . also the resulting estimates ( ( [ bors5 ] ) , ( [ vr3 ] ) and , respectively , ( [ vrk3 ] ) ) are considerably looser than such a straightforward extension .",
    "some examples to illustrate this are in table 3 .",
    "this result indicates , in view of the fact that our bounds can be saturated , that in applying an operator product expansion one should not mechanically extend ( [ v2 ] ) into the complex @xmath35 plane without special physical justification .",
    "in either case , the resulting bounds exhibit a pronounced angle dependence in the @xmath35 plane , becoming worse and worse with increasing deflection from the euclidean region down to the cut . as a consequence ,",
    "the integrated bounds on ( [ rta2 ] , [ rtau ] ) or ( [ hmom ] ) are looser than those based on the a priori assumption of angle independence .",
    "this result can be understood as a warning that conventional truncation error estimates used in phenomenology are perhaps too optimistic .    as our results are valid for certain classes of functions , a reduction of the class considered to a smaller one could yield a more restrictive upper bound .",
