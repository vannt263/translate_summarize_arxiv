    "4 ) for review .",
    "our present calculation of the compton amplitude follows that of ref .",
    "@xcite below photoproduction threshold ( and hence for the static polarisabilities ) , but improves the treatment of the delta - excitation near the resonance , as described below .",
    "our eft expansion uses the @xmath21-counting  @xcite , where the mass difference between the nucleon and the delta , @xmath22 , is considered an intermediate scale , so that m_// _ , and hence the usual chiral expansion scale @xmath23 is counted as @xmath24 .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath21-counting is that the characteristic momentum @xmath25 distinguishes two regimes : _ low energy : _",
    "@xmath26 , and _ delta - resonance : _ @xmath27 .",
    "since the delta propagators go as @xmath28 , rather than simply @xmath29 as for the nucleon , the counting of the graphs with deltas is different in the two regimes .",
    "for example , replacing a nucleon propagator by a delta changes the power of the graph by @xmath30 , which is @xmath31 in the low - energy regime and @xmath32 in the resonance region .",
    "in addition , the counting demands that the one - delta - reducible ( @xmath33r ) loop graphs , which contain the pole at @xmath34 , are resummed in the regime @xmath35 , which gives rise to the delta - resonance width and results in a natural description of the resonance peak .    in general , a graph with @xmath36 loops , @xmath37 pion propagators , @xmath38 nucleon propagators , @xmath39 delta propagators and @xmath40 vertices of order @xmath41 counts in the low - energy regime as @xmath42 , with n = 4l - 2n_-n_n -n_+ k v_k . in the resonance regime , one identifies the number of the @xmath33r propagators , @xmath43 , then n = 4l - 2n_-n_n - n_- 2 n_1 + k v_k .    in the low - energy regime , which is most relevant for the extraction of nucleon polarisabilities , the diagrams with @xmath39 delta propagators are suppressed by @xmath44 , or equivalently by @xmath45 , with respect to the same diagram but with nucleon propagators .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) contribution in this regime hence comes from the nucleon born term ( first two diagrams in ) which are responsible , for instance , for the correct thomson limit .",
    "inclusion of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment in these graphs is warranted at @xmath46 , which here is the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .                also of @xmath46",
    "is the @xmath47-pole graph in , and all of the pion - nucleon loops in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinloops ] .",
    "these graphs give the lo contribution to the polarisabilities , as the born graphs do not contribute to polarisabilities by definition .",
    "the delta - pole and pion - delta loop graphs , fig .",
    "[ fig : pidloops ] , enter at @xmath48 , here the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , and give the nlo contribution to polarisabilities .",
    "we note that the delta - pole term , despite being formally suppressed compared to the pion - nucleon loops , has long been known to give a large contribution to the magnetic polarisabilities of the nucleon .",
    "the nnlo amplitude thus receives contributions from the nucleon born and @xmath47 pole graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : born ] , the @xmath49 loop graphs of fig .",

    "[ fig : pidloops ] ; all of these were computed in @xcite .      in order to extend this calculation to the delta - resonance region ,",
    "we resum the @xmath50 loop contributions to the delta propagator in the delta - pole graphs , as explained in ref .",
    "in addition we take into account the leading pion - loop corrections to the @xmath51n@xmath52 vertex , shown in fig .  [",

    "those additions are important for unitarity above the pion threshold . at nlo in the regime @xmath35 ,",

    "; this means that these corrections vanish below the pion production threshold and hence do not affect the static polarisabilities .",
