    "<S> we have presented theoretical and numerical studies on interactions of dispersive waves with second order solitons . </S>",
    "<S> disperive wave with considerable intensity resonantly colliding with the second order solitons can lead to acceleration / decceleration of the later with subsequent central frequency shifts , but still well preserve the oscillating structure of the 2-solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-soliton creates an effective periodical refractive index profile and thus reflected and transmitted dispersive waves generate new spectral bands with sharp peak structures . </S>",
    "<S> when resonant dispersive waves interact with two second order solitons bounding them , multiple scattering with multiple frequency conversion of the radiation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> thus 2-solitons and radiation trapped in between them can produce effective solitonic cavity with `` flat '' or `` concave mirrors '' depending on the intensity of the input .    </S>",
    "<S> optical solitons attract attention of researches for decades due to the profound interest of their fundamental physics and technological applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the fundamental solitons , integrable models and physical media described by nearly - integrable equations @xcite support high order @xmath0-solitons , with @xmath1 , which are oscillating pulses periodically restoring their shape at distances that are multiples of the fundamental soliton period @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental realization of 2- and 3-order optical solitons dates back to 1983 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial narrowing of higher - order solitons was observed for soliton s orders up to @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> higher - order solitons were also demonstrated in the cavity of a mode - locked dye laser @xcite . strongly oscillating higher - order solitons </S>",
    "<S> find natural applications for the pulse compression @xcite and frequency conversion @xcite , while the breakup of high order solitons initiates the extremely important process of the supercontinuum generation @xcite .    propagation of optical pulse close to zero dispersion wavelength makes important consideration of high order dispersion terms and in particular the third order dispersion ( tod ) term . </S>",
    "<S> second order solitons ( 2-solitons ) were found to be practically robust under the influence of moderate tod @xcite , preserving their periodically oscillating nature . </S>",
    "<S> very recently resonant radiation of 2-solitons was investigated @xcite revealing fascinating structure of radiation band consisting of multiple frequency peaks . </S>",
    "<S> while emitting the mentioned above radiation 2-soliton remained its fundamental features for many periods . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , oscillating dissipative solitons featuring similar radiation behavior were reported too @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in is relevant to mention that extensive studies were performed considering scattering of weak dws on fundamental solitons , with soliton s properties remaining invariant @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it was also demonstrated that strong resonant collision of dws with solitons can accelerate or decelerate solitons . </S>",
    "<S> these accelerations manifest themselves in frequency domain by upshifts or downshifts of central frequencies of the solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generation of new bands of frequencies due to the scattering of dws from solitons can be viewed as an alternative technique for generation of broad and coherent supercontinuum @xcite without the high order soliton fission .    </S>",
    "<S> taking one step further a very interesting scenario with dws interacting with two co - propagating solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dws temporally located in between the solitons interact with one soliton after the other bouncing of them . </S>",
    "<S> this process can repeat itself many times resulting in creation of solitonic cavity behaving like two mirrors for the dws . in case of dws with considerable intensity </S>",
    "<S> , the two solitons get attracted one towards the other , resulting in collision or even fusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was proven to be responsible for the appearance of multiple soliton knot patterns @xcite during the complex supercontinuum generation process . </S>",
    "<S> such a solitonic cavity was very recently successfully realized in experimental conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also a `` convex mirror '' cavity with mutually repulsing via dw two dark solitons was demonstrated @xcite .    in the present work we aim to study interactions of 2-solitons with external dispersive waves ( dws ) , demonstrating a possibility to manipulate propagation trajectories of the 2-solitons , to create broad continuum with rich spectral properties and also to create solitonic cavities consisting of two 2-solitons and dws bouncing between them .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamics of optical pulse in the vicinity of zero dispersion wavelength ( zdw ) is governed by nonlinear schrdinger equation with the inclusion of tod . </S>",

    "<S> considering standard fiber with @xmath7 and launching a soliton at central wavelength of @xmath8 , we will work with the following values of dispersion parameters : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear coefficient is taken @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the injected light consist of two pulses launched with different frequencies namely soliton and dw @xmath12 the 2-soliton has the initial form @xmath13 with temporal width of @xmath14 and the peak power of corresponding fundamental soliton @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> the result of collision of a relatively wide dw ( @xmath22 ) centered at @xmath23 and having a very small amplitude of @xmath24 with the 2-soliton is presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ scatteringwidedw](a ) demonstrates dynamics in temporal domain and it reveals that the dw is partially scattered and partially transmitted through the 2-soliton that creates an effective periodic refractive index potential . in general one can archive much higher percentage of scattering by optimizing the incident wavelength of the dw within the resonance band , but here we aim to inspect also the transmitted part of the dw . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the spectral domain representation of the dynamics in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ scatteringwidedw](b ) we can see several new frequency bands arising in a course of evolution . the leftmost band below @xmath25 consisting of multiple peaks is the resonant or cherenkov radiation @xcite emitted form the 2-soliton . </S>",

    "<S> the resonance frequencies for the radiation generated by fwm mixing between incident dw and 2-soliton were derived by using the perturbation theory similar to the analysis for the fundamental soliton in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the fundamental soliton case , the resonant radiation becomes polychromatic , with frequency detunings for incident and scattered fields @xmath30 being tied by the following relation @xmath31 we solved the graphically in order to obtain the spectral positions of the transmitted and reflected peaks and presented it in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we collide dw with the 2-soliton as in the previous chapter , but this time we increase its input intensity to @xmath40 , that is still several times smaller that the input peak intensity of the 2-soliton participating in the collision and we will take the width of the dw equal to that of the soliton ( @xmath41 ) . a typical result of collision of strong dw with the 2-soliton still resisting to the splitting </S>",
