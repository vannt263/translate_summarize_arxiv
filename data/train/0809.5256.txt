    "they are smaller and denser ( r @xmath2 0.1 pc , n @xmath4 @xmath5 ) than , and kinematically distinct from , the molecular clouds in which they are found @xcite . because starless cores have no source of internal heating , the temperature of a starless core is determined by external illumination and self - shielding .",
    "the temperatures of starless cores are set by the interstellar radiation field , and in some cases luminous nearby stars , attenuated by the molecular cloud .",
    "the temperature profile within a starless core is determined by the heating of its outer layers and the internal extinction , making the centers of starless cores colder than their outer layers @xcite .",
    "the temperatures of starless cores can be inferred from thermal emission from dust or from molecular lines .",
    "deriving core temperatures from continuum emission is complicated by uncertainties in the dust emission spectrum .",
    "for instance , in cold and dense regions dust grains are expected to coagulate and become covered in icy mantles , creating variation in the emissivity spectral index @xcite .",
    "in addition , below a density of @xmath6 the dust temperature is not coupled to the gas temperature @xcite , which is the more important quantity because the gas makes up @xmath299% of the mass .",
    "one of the best tracers of gas temperature is the rotation - inversion lines of nh@xmath0 .",
    "ammonia is particularly well suited for this type of study because 1 ) nh@xmath0  does not seem to deplete onto dust grains in starless cores , and in fact may have an enhanced abundance where co is depleted @xcite 2 ) nh@xmath0  has hyperfine splitting of its inversion lines , making fits to the temperature , velocity and optical depth more certain 3 ) the nh@xmath0  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions are separated by a small difference in frequency , so it is possible to simultaneously observe both sets of lines . in this paper",
    "we use ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations @xcite to derive the temperature of starless cores .",
    "we examine whether these data support the several models of the relationship between core properties and the molecular cloud where they are found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", there is a wealth of data on the cores and the cloud that enables us to study the influences of various internal and environmental factors on the temperature of 50 starless cores in perseus .",
    "as described in @xcite , we used far - infrared emission maps at 70 , 100 and 160  to derive the dust temperature and column density of the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "the 70 and 160  maps were obtained as part of the c2d survey @xcite , and the 100  map was taken from the iris reprocessing of the iras all - sky maps @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the emission - derived column density ( n@xmath7 ) and dust temperature ( t@xmath8 ) maps with which we will compare the nh@xmath0  temperature ( t@xmath1 ) is 40 , as set by the 160  data .",
    "the dust temperature is calculated from the ratio of the observed flux at 70 and 160 , taking into account the color correction at both wavelengths and the emission from transiently heated very small dust grains at 70 .",
    "the column density is derived from the flux at 160  and the dust temperature , allowing for a variable dust emissivity and normalized to the extinction measured from nir reddening .",
    "maps of the emission - derived dust temperature and column density , and the procedure used to make the maps , are presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "data from the final release of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog was used to create a large - scale extinction map of perseus as part of the complete survey @xcite .",
    "the nicer algorithm estimates the column density towards background stars by comparing their observed colors with the ( assumed ) instrinsic colors @xcite .",
    "although we expect the extinction map to be our least - biased estimate of the cloud column density @xcite , its 5  resolution is roughly ten times coarser than our other maps , which smooths out density gradients and makes it somewhat harder to compare the cloud and core properties .",
    "we used observations of 193 dense cores and core candidates in the perseus molecular cloud using the 100-m robert f. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) as described in @xcite . for each target",
    ", single - pointing ( 31  fwhm ) observations were made of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines with 0.024 km s@xmath9  spectral resolution .",

    "the starless cores discussed in this paper were drawn from from only the first two categories .",
    "the kinetic temperatures of the starless cores ( section [ ident ] describes how we identify which cores are starless ) are determined by a simultaneous fit to the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission profiles , accounting for collisional deexcitation of the two states .",
    "the same fit also yields the width of the nh@xmath0  line , which is decomposed into its thermal and non - thermal components based on the temperature determination .",
    "although there are likely gas temperature and density gradients within each starless core on both theoretical and observational grouds @xcite , the fitting of the ammonia - derived temperature is essentially an average over the core properties .",
    "however , a single - temperature model with uniform excitation conditions is a reasonably good fit to nearly all of the starless core in this sample .",
    "the nh@xmath0 observations can be used to accurately derive the kinetic temperatures of starless cores with @xmath10 where the lower and upper limits are set by sensitivity and transition thermalization respectively @xcite .",

    ", we use the 1.1 mm derived fluxes and sizes to compare the t@xmath1  with core properties such as mass , column density and volume density .",
    "to ensure that we only study the starless core population in perseus , we compare the positions of our nh@xmath0  observations with the coordinates of known protostars , as found through the analysis of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xcite identifies 55 protostellar cores out of the total 122 millimeter cores in perseus using the spatial coincidence between 1.1 mm continuum cores and sources identified in the c2d delivery document @xcite as `` ysoc '' ( yso candidate ) , `` red '' or that are 70 point sources and are not classified as `` galc '' ( galaxy candidate ) . in this paper",
    "we only consider those 50 ammonia pointings that are called `` starless '' by the various definitions of all three papers , or that are more than 30  from any identified protostar in any of the three papers .",
    "none of the cores we classify as `` starless '' are identified as a low - luminosity embedded protostar by @xcite .",
    "we also require that the starless cores have solid nh@xmath0-derived temperatures and linewidths , meaning that t@xmath1  is greater than 2.73 k , the nh@xmath0  ( 2,2 ) detection is @xmath15 and the model and observed spectra fit well by eye . of the 193 observations in the nh@xmath0  survey , 137 of the pointings are not coincident with an identified protostar , and 50 of these",

    "here we compare the ammonia - derived temperature with several properties of the starless cores and their environment .",
    "we considered only those 50 starless cores with well - defined t@xmath1  and linewidth , so we are able to derive their non - thermal linewidths .",
    "all were detected in the 1.1 mm survey of @xcite , so for each we have the total flux , peak flux ( from which we derive the peak column density ) , mass ( from the total flux and the nh@xmath0  temperature ) and mean particle density .",
    "the fir - derived dust temperature and column density are considered to be believable as long as they fall within the range @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is true except in those regions where the 160  map is saturated or corrupted by a nearby bright source .",

    "the internal properties of our sample of starless cores are listed in table [ coreproptab ] , and the properties of perseus cloud along the line of sight to the cores are given in table [ coreenvirtab ] .",
    "although the distance from each starless core to the nearest protostar found in the surveys of @xcite and @xcite is known , in our discussion of possible correlations we consider only those with separations of 0.25 pc or smaller .",
    "the kinetic temperature distribution probed by nh@xmath0  is quite narrow , from @xmath2 9 - 15 k , as seen in fig .",
    "[ tkinhist ] .",
    "this may be due to the relatively low angular resolution of the gbt pointings , whose 31  beam corresponds to probing the inner 0.019 pc ( 3.9@xmath20 au ) of each core .",
    "models of externally heated prestellar cores show that they are only significantly colder than 9 k within the inner @xmath21 au or warmer than 14 k outside a radius of @xmath22 au , with variation depending on the strength of the isrf incident upon the core @xcite .",
    "we are unlikely to be biased by chemical effects , given that nh@xmath0  is not seen to deplete in starless cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the critical density of nh@xmath0 , @xmath23 @xmath5  @xcite , is low compared the typical gas densities observed in the cores in our sample ( @xmath24 @xmath5  @xmath25 @xmath5 ) , so we expect the nh@xmath0  observations to sample the full volume of our cores .",
    "the range of temperatures seen in the perseus starless cores is typical of those seen in other molecular clouds .",
    "for instance , @xcite derived dust temperatures of pre - stellar cores in taurus and ophiuchus and found that most cores fall within the 9 - 13k range .",
    "the peak of the t@xmath1  distribution shown in figure [ tkinhist ] is between 10 - 11k , which agrees well with the median temperature ( 11 k ) derived from nh@xmath0  observations of the 36 starless as observed and identified by @xcite across many nearby star forming regions .",
    "the lower and upper quartiles of the temperatures of the @xcite starless core sample ( 9.7 k and 14.0 k ) are also a close match to that shown in figure [ tkinhist ] .",
    "numerical simulations of starless cores have been used to quantify how their temperature profile is affected by variations in many parameters , such as the strength of the isrf , the density profile , and the amount of extinction provided by the molecular cloud in which the cores are embedded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite calculate that for bonnor - ebert spheres with central densities varying by about a factor of 100 ( from 10@xmath26 to 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ) , the central temperature varies by a factor of @xmath22 ( 6.5 - 10 k ) , but the temperature at a radius of 10@xmath28 au ( the radius of the gbt beam at the distance of perseus ) only varies by @xmath21 k ( 9 - 10 k ) . a doubling of the strength of the isrf results in a 1 k increase of the core temperature file over the range of radii probed by the nh@xmath0  observations in this study @xcite , while a factor of 100 increase in the isrf would result in an increase in the core temperature by a factor of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "variations in the dust opacity also affect the temperature of starless core , but @xcite show that this effect is quite small ( @xmath29 k ) for the range of dust properties that one expects in these cores .",
    "given that the temperature of a prestellar core ( at a radius of 10@xmath28 au ) is not especially sensitive to its central density , the dust opacity , the strength of the isrf or the degree of extinction for the range of values that we expect in perseus , the narrow width of the temperature distribution shown in figure [ tkinhist ] and its peak at 10 k are roughly what one would expect .",
    "the presence of local star formation appears to affect t@xmath1 .",
    "[ tkinhist ] shows the temperature distribution of all the starless cores in perseus ( filled grey histogram ) , as well as that for starless cores in the clusters ngc1333 and ic348 ( open solid histogram ) and field starless cores ( open dashed histogram ) .",
    "the boundaries for ngc1333 and ic348 are taken from @xcite .",
    "it is clear that those cores in clusters are warmer than those outside clusters .",
    "the probability that the temperature distributions of starless cores inside and outside clusters have the same mean is @xmath30 , as calculated by a wilcoxon rank - sum test , student s t - statistic or two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "there are reasons to expect that starless cores in clusters would be warmer than those outside clusters .",
    "for instance , a cluster of protostars may directly heat their environment .",
    "in addition , protostars inject turbulence into the surrounding medium , making it more porous and less effective as a shield from the isrf . in addition",
    ", @xcite find that dense cores that are not associated with _ iras _ sources are warmer when found inside clusters than outside .",
    "@xcite predict that the presence of a nearby class 0 protostar should not affect the temperature of a nearby starless core at all , and that a nearby class i protostar will only heat the outer layers of a core , and only by @xmath31k .",
    "we test this by comparing the nh@xmath0-derived temperatures of starless cores in perseus to the distance to the nearest class 0 and i protostars ( as determined by @xcite ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tkinenvironment ] and table [ correltab ] , we confirm that there is no significant correlation between t@xmath1  and the distance to the nearest protostar for those starless cores in the clusters ngc1333 and ic348 . however , there is a significant negative correlation between t@xmath1  and the distance to the nearest class 0 and/or i protostar for those starless cores in the field ( i.e. starless cores further from protostars are colder ) .",
    "it is not at all certain that this result contradicts the prediction of @xcite , because we can not say that nearby protostars heat starless cores , just that warmer cores are found near protostars .",
    "here we compare the temperatures of starless cores with the temperature of the material in which it is embedded .",
    "we estimate the line - of - sight averaged temperature of the dust ( t@xmath8 ) @xcite and the gas ( t@xmath19 ) @xcite in the perseus molecular cloud and compare it with the temperature derived from the nh@xmath0  pointings .",
    "the resolution of the t@xmath8  and t@xmath19  maps are both @xmath240 , which is roughly comparable to the 31  resolution of the ammonia data . however , both t@xmath8  and t@xmath19  are imperfect measures of cloud temperature . because @xmath12co is optically thick ( and perhaps depleted ) it is not sensitive to the colder and denser cloud material in which the starless cores are embedded .",
    "the dust temperature determination is emission - weighted , and at the fir wavelengths ( 70 and 160 ) of the spitzer maps the emission is dominated by warm dust along the line of sight , and therefore is less sensitive to the colder and denser clumps in which cores form .    nevertheless , one might expect that the temperature of a starless core could be affected , or predicted , by the temperature of the medium in which is it embedded .",
    "starless cores are , by definition , externally heated , so whatever is heating the cloud should also be heating the embedded cores . this analysis can be biased because the gas and dust derived temperatures are warmer within the clusters than outside , which is also true for t@xmath1 , so any derived correlations must take this into account .",
    "figure [ tkinenvironment ] and tab .",
    "[ correltab ] show that although both t@xmath19  and t@xmath8  are significantly and positively correlated with t@xmath1  when considering the entire population of starless cores , this effect is entirely explained by the cluster / field bias , and within each sub - population there is no significant correlation .",
    "the heating of starless cores is governed by the strength of the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "given that there are no o or b stars within the perseus molecular cloud , the isrf seen by the cores should depend largely on dust shielding but not on the distance to any special source of external radiation .",
    "because we are unable to measure the volume - averaged shielding around each starless core , we use as a proxy the column density along the line of sight . based on this simple analysis",
    ", one would predict that t@xmath1  would be anti - correlated with column density .    on the other hand , for starless cores that are in pressure equilibrium , the inward pressures due to the weight of the perseus molecular cloud and the self - gravity of the cores will be counter balanced by the internal gas pressure from thermal and non - thermal motion .",
    "the external pressure on the starless cores from the molecular cloud is proportional to the square of the column density ( @xmath32 ) @xcite and the internal gas pressure from thermal motions is proportial to t@xmath1(@xmath33 t@xmath1 ) . from a balance of pressure analysis",
    ", one would expect a positive correlation between t@xmath1  and column density , though this would not necessarily be a strong effect because outward pressure is also supplied by non - thermal motions and magnetic fields .",
    "we calculate that for the starless cores in our sample the inward pressure of the weight of the molecular cloud is roughly a factor of 2 weaker than their self - gravity .",
    "here we compare the temperatures of starless cores with the column density of molecular cloud material along the line of sight to each core .",
    "we estimate the cloud column density using far - infrared dust emission @xcite and near - infrared extinction @xcite .",
    "although extinction may be the most secure estimator of column density in a molecular cloud @xcite , the 40  resolution of the emission - derived column density map compares favorably with the 5  resolution of the near - infrared extinction map . as with the cloud temperature",
    ", there is an inherent bias in that the column density in the clusters is higher and the core temperatures are higher , so we consider the field and cluster starless cores separately .",
    "figure [ tkinenvironment ] and table [ correltab ] show that there is a significant positive correlation between extinction - derived column density and t@xmath1  when considering just the starless cores in the field and just the starless cores in the clusters , as well as for the field+cluster ensemble .",
    "there is no significant trend between t@xmath1  and the dust emission - derived column density for field or cluster cores .",
    "one should keep in mind that the emission - derived column density derived from dust emission loses accuracy at values of @xmath34 a few , so it is not so surprising to get different results depending on how the column density is estimated @xcite .",
    "the dust temperature derived from fir maps is emission - weighted , and the column density derivation depends on the dust temperature , so the column density along lines of sight with significant variations in temperature and density is both systemically underestimated and subject to large scatter .",
    "this effect could wash out any true correlations between the column density of the cloud material and the temperature of the core embedded in it .    in a numerical simulation of embedded starless cores ,",
    "@xcite show that the temperature profile of a core shielded by @xmath18 = 5 material ( a typical value for @xmath18 seen towards the starless cores in perseus ) is not significantly different from a naked core , while deeply embedded cores ( @xmath18 = 20 ) are noticably colder than naked cores . in addition , we expect that the column density along the line of sight is a poor indicator of volumetric shielding due to the porosity of molecular clouds like perseus . the visual impression given by two - dimensional maps and position - position - velocity cubes of nearby molecular clouds is one of non - relaxed structures with many filaments , voids and shells , supporting this view .",
    "the observational evidence supports the idea that the shielding provided by higher @xmath18  material in perseus does not lead to lower temperatures of the embedded starless cores .",
    "the opposite effect is observed , which may be explained by the greater thermal support needed to balance the increased pressure on the cores by the weight of the molecular cloud .",
    "clumpiness formed by turbulence in a molecular cloud is known to significantly affect the temperature of the cloud material , with higher turbulence leading to greater porosity and penetration by the isrf , and therefore higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that the densest portions of the cloud ( where starless cores are found ) are primarily heated by long wavelength radiation that is not effectively shielded by the clumpy structure .",
    "it is therefore not obvious if one would expect starless core temperatures to be correlated with turbulence .",
    "here we examine whether turbulence affects the temperature of the starless cores in the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "we use the non - thermal linewidth of nh@xmath0  as a proxy for the turbulence within the cores , and the total linewidth of @xmath3co as an estimate of the turbulence in the surrounding medium ( the measured @xmath3co linewidth is roughly a factor of 10 higher than the thermal linewidth ) . as before , we consider field and cluster starless cores separately to avoid confusing a correlation between t@xmath1  and turbulence with a correlation between t@xmath1  and the field vs.  cluster environment .",
    "figure [ tkininternal ] and table [ correltab ] show that there is no correlation between the non - thermal linewidth of nh@xmath0  and t@xmath1when considering the field and cluster popoluations of starless cores separately , but there is a significant positive correlation for the ensemble .",
    "this implies that those starless cores in perseus are more turbulent when found in clusters than in the field , but the turbulence itself does not necessarily lead to higher temperatures .",
    "our expectation of starless core geometry is that they are in some sense `` relaxed '' structures and therefore not porous , regardless of the level of internal turbulence .",
    "co linewidth does not correlate with t@xmath1  for those cores in clusters , but it is significantly positively correlated with t@xmath1  for field starless cores , as shown in figure [ tkinenvironment ] .",
    "one interpretation of of the field / cluster difference is that within clusters the co linewidth is likely to be affected strongly by the ongoing star formation , while the co linewidth in the field better traces the cloud geometry , so only in the field does a larger co linewidth imply better penetration by the isrf .",
    "it might be supposed that the temperatures of starless cores are partly determined by the internal properties of the cores themselves , and not just by their environment .",
    "here we compare t@xmath1  with 1.1 mm bolocam flux , the peak column density ( expressed in @xmath18 ) , the mass and the average volume density derived from the 1.1 mm map and nh@xmath0-derived temperature of each core .",

    "although this assumption is valid for the densities ( @xmath57 @xmath5 ) derived for these cores @xcite , we are introducing a potential bias in our analysis because t@xmath1  and the derived mass are not independent .",
    "it would be preferable to use the t@xmath58 rather than t@xmath1  to determine the 1.1mm - derived core properties , but this requires mapping the dust emission from each core at several wavelengths , sampling both the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as well as the rayleigh - jeans tail to derive the dust temperature , column desnity and emissivity spectral index profiles .",
    "existing surveys of perseus @xcite have only sampled the rayleigh - jeans portion of the sed , so we do not have accurate estimates of the dust temperatures within the starless cores , and we are forced to use the gas temperature in our calculations .    note",
    "that some of the bolocam cores , whose numbers are given in table [ coreproptab ] ( per - bolo 24 , 75 , 100 and 122 ) , have been observed in multiple gbt pointings with each position corresponding to different sub - condensations within the core .",
    "each of these pointings is assigned the same 1.1 mm total and peak flux and dimensions as that of the entire bolocam core , and the peak @xmath18 , mass and density are all derived from the overall core bolocam flux measurements and the t@xmath1  derived for the sub - core . an alternative analysis would have been to break up each bolocam core with more than one nh@xmath0  pointing into sub - cores and assign different fractions of the total 1.1 mm flux to each portion , but the procedure to do the division would be somewhat arbitrary , just as the decision of which cores should be observed only once and which in multiple positions was not based on an absolute prescription . since neither analysis is obviously the correct one , we decided to go with the simpler of the two and double - count the 1.1 mm properties of the four bolocam cores with more than one nh@xmath0  observation .    in fig .",

    "although there is no correlation between t@xmath1  and the distance to the nearest class 0/i protostar for those starless cores in clusters , starless cores in the field are colder the further away they are from protostars .",
    "certain properties of the molecular cloud are related to the temperatures of the starless cores embedded in it .",
    "t@xmath1  is higher when the extinction - derived column density of the molecular cloud is larger , despite the additional shielding from the isrf that the higher column density implies , which may be due to the increased pressure on the cores from the molecular cloud in higher column density regions .",
    "this correlation is not seen when column density along the line of sight in perseus is measured from far - infrared dust emission . after controlling for the cluster / field temperature difference",
    ", we find that t@xmath1  does not depend on the temperature of the molecular cloud , as measured by co or dust emission .",
    "the clusters have higher values of t@xmath19  and t@xmath8  on average , so presumably the same processes that are heating the clusters are also heating the cores within them . those starless cores outside",
    "ngc1333 and ic348 are warmer in regions with higher @xmath3co linewidth , suggesting the the turbulence causing the high linewidths makes the cloud more porous to the isrf , which in turn heats the embedded cores .",
    "there is no significant correlation between @xmath60 and t@xmath1  for those cores in the clusters .",
    "some internal properties of starless cores are correlated with their temperature . for those starless cores in the field ,",
    "total 1.1 mm flux is higher in cores that are warmer , and peak column density and average volume density are higher in cores that are colder .",
    "a higher temperature naturally leads to more 1.1 mm flux for a given core mass , and the correlations between t@xmath1  and peak core column density and volume density can be explained by the amount of shielding from the isrf that the additional material provides .",
    "however , it is surprising that none of these correlations exist for starless cores inside the clusters .",
