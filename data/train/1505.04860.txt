    "in the pioneering work @xcite , casimir proposed the existence of a force between two parallel perfectly conducting plates due to the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields .",
    "this gives rise to the concept of vacuum energy , which was referred to as casimir energy . in subsequent years",
    ", casimir effect has been generalized to any quantum fields , and it is a purely quantum effect .",
    "the idea of this casimir energy is quite simple .",
    "the ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is not zero , but it is equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the frequency . a quantum field can be considered as the superposition of an infinite number of quantum harmonic oscillators , each with a different ground state energy .",
    "casimir defined the casimir energy as the sum of the ground state energies : @xmath16 this sum is divergent and regularization is required . however , in the existence of two objects ( boundaries ) , one can obtain a _ finite _",
    "casimir interaction energy after subtracting away the casimir self energies of each of the objects .",
    "the casimir self energy of an object is of its own interest and it has been under active investigation ( see @xcite for a review ) . on the one hand , it is closely related to the one - loop effective action @xcite , and on the other hand , it has been proposed to be a candidate for the dark energy @xcite . since the advent of string theory , studying physics in higher dimensional spacetime has become a norm rather than an exception .",
    "there have been quite a number of works that explored the casimir energies of rectangular cavities , spheres and cylinders in higher dimensional spacetimes @xcite .",
    "casimir effect is more interesting when there exist two interacting objects . in the last century",
    ", theoretical computations of casimir interaction were limited to the configuration of two parallel plates .",
    "however , the advancement in nanotechnology and casimir experiments at the end of the last century have called for theoretical understanding of the casimir interaction between any non - flat objects .",
    "about ten years ago , a major breakthrough in casimir research was brought by a few groups of researchers @xcite , which have shed new light on the research of casimir interaction between two objects .",
    "using worldline numerics , multiple - scattering method or mode summation method , exact formulas for the casimir interactions of cylinder - plate , cylinder - cylinder , sphere - plate , sphere - sphere configurations have been computed .",
    "this has enabled the more precise analytical and numerical studies of the nature and the strength of casimir force .",
    "nonetheless , these works have been limited to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "last year , we have taken the first step to understand the casimir interactions between non - flat objects in higher dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "we have considered the sphere - plate and sphere - sphere interactions due to the vacuum fluctuations of massless scalar fields in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime and studied the dependence of the casimir interaction on the dimension of spacetime . since cylindrical objects played an equally important role in physics as spherical objects",
