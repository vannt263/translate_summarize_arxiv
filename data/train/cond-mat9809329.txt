    "since the pioneering work of mandelbrot _ et .",
    "@xcite , it has been firmly established that topography of fracture surfaces exhibits remarkable scaling properties .",
    "a fracture surface @xmath2 is statistically invariant under an anisotropic scaling transformation : @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the _ roughness exponent_. experimental results obtained on various materials ( steels @xcite , glass @xcite , rocks @xcite , ceramics @xcite , metallic alloys @xcite and aluminium alloys @xcite ) , both fragile and ductile , have shown that the roughness exponent @xmath1 is found between 0.7 and 0.9 ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the robustness of the results seems to support the idea suggested by bouchaud _ et .",
    "al . _ @xcite that @xmath4 might be a universal value of the roughness exponent , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent of the material properties .",
    "this conjecture implies that the fracture toughness is not correlated to the roughness exponent @xmath1",
    ". however , morphology of fracture surfaces seems to be affected by material properties .",
    "it has been suggested by bouchaud _ et .",
    "_ @xcite that models of front lines propagating through randomly distributed impurities @xcite might be relevant to understand the morphology of the fracture surfaces@xcite .",
    "the development of the fracture roughness has been described as a family - vicsek scaling @xcite . however , in a very recent experimental study @xcite , it has been found that the surface of a brittle fracture in a granite block exhibited anomalous dynamic scaling properties akin to what occurs in some models of nonequilibrium kinetic roughening @xcite .",
    "the anomalous scaling is defined as follows .",
    "the development of the fluctuations of the height @xmath5 with time is characterized by the root mean square @xmath6 at time @xmath7 over a window size @xmath8 along the @xmath9-axis ( perpendicular to the propagation direction ) @xmath10 where the brackets @xmath11 denotes an average over the window position @xmath12 .",
    "the roughness @xmath6 is expected to scale in the case of anomalous scaling as @xcite @xmath13 where the exponent @xmath14 is an anomalous time exponent .",
    "this anomalous dynamic scaling involves two different and independent roughness exponents : the local roughness exponent @xmath0 , which describes the scaling when one considers windows smaller than the system size , and the global exponent @xmath1 for scaling involving the system size@xcite .",
    "the local roughness exponent @xmath0 is actually at reach of the methods currently used for experiment analyses .",
    "the global exponent @xmath1 is more difficult to extract from a classical roughness measurement .",
    "both exponents have to be taken into account for a complete description of the scaling behavior of the surface . according to eq .",
    "( [ local ] ) , the correlation length @xmath15 corresponds to a characteristic lenght below which the surface appears as self - affine with the local exponent @xmath0 .    in ref.@xcite , global and local roughness exponents , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "respectively , have been measured .",
    "the latter study was performed on a mechanically isotropic material ( granite ) . however , many materials have anisotropic mechanical properties like wood , reinforced concrete and most composite materials .",
    "anisotropic properties result generally from structural reinforcements along specific directions .",
    "it is of great interest to understand how fractures in such materials are influenced by the anisotropic texture .    in this study",
    ", we determine the complete scaling behavior of the fracture roughness resulting from stable crack propagation in wood samples of different sizes .",
    "for two different woods ( maritime pine and norway spruce ) , we show that the local fluctuations of crack surfaces exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling properties .",
    "the global roughness exponent is different for both woods .",
    "local roughness exponents are identical for both woods and support the conjecture of a universal local roughness exponent for brittle fracture surfaces .",
    "the main consequence of this anomalous scaling is that the magnitude of the surface fluctuations over regions is not just a function of the region size but also of the system size .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we describe experimental setups for crack propagation and fracture surface measurement .",
    "section [ sec : anomal ] is devoted to the anomalous dynamic scaling behavior . in sec .",

    "wood is a natural material which displays a structural anisotropy resulting from the presence of running cells in the radial direction .",
    "two commercially wood species have been tested : maritime pine ( _ pinus pinaster ait _ ) and norway spruce ( _ picea abies l. _ ) .",
    "pine specimens have an average oven dry specific weight @xmath18 of 560 kg / m@xmath19 and growth rings are approximately 4 mm wide .",
    "typical values for spruce specimens are : @xmath18 = 390 kg / m@xmath19 and growth rings of 2 to 5 mm wide .",
    "moisture content of all specimens was measured between 11 and 13 % .",
    "crack surfaces are obtained from a modified tapered double cantilever beam ( tdcb ) specimens .",
    "a fracture was initiated from a straight notch machined with a band saw ( thickness 2 mm ) and prolonged on few millimeters with a razor blade ( thickness 0.2 mm ) .",
    "fracture is obtained through uniaxial tension with a constant opening rate ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the tapered shape of the specimens allows to obtain a mode i stable crack growth ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) which induces a constant crack speed .",
    "the crack speed was around 0.6 mm / s ( from 0.3 mm / s for small specimens to 1mm / s for large specimens ) .",
    "crack surfaces were generated along an average radial - longitudinal plane by aligning the growth rings perpendicular to the straight notch . in order to obtain an evolution of the amplitude of the roughness as function of the system size , three geometrically",
    "similar specimens of sufficiently different sizes have been fractured .",
    "we used samples of size @xmath20 equal to 11.25 , 30 , and 60 mm ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "anatomical characteristics of wood introduce typical scales which might appears as cutoffs for scale invariances .",
    "most tetragonal tracheid cells in pine and spruce are about 25 @xmath21 m wide .",
    "during loading cell walls break revealing u - shaped profiles with rugged edges because of the rectangular shape of the tracheid section .",
    "thickness of cell walls varies from 2 to 10 @xmath21 m .",
    "this facies of fracture surface is characteristic of a local brittle fracture process .",
    "topographies of the crack surfaces were recorded with a mechanical profiler along regular grids .",
    "grid axes are along the @xmath9 direction which is parallel to the initial notch and along the @xmath22 direction which is the crack propagation direction ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the step of sampling in the @xmath9 direction is adjusted to the minimum cell width : @xmath23 = 25 @xmath21 m and to the cell length in the @xmath22 direction : @xmath24 = 2.5 mm .",
    "profiles along the @xmath9-axis were sampled with 2050 points for specimens of width @xmath20 = 60 mm , 1030 points for specimens of width @xmath20 = 30 mm , and 360 points for specimens of width @xmath20 = 11.25 mm . for each map , the first profile ( @xmath22 = 0 ) is sampled in the immediate vicinity of the initial straight notch and has a zero roughness . as the distance @xmath22 to the notch increases , the roughness develops up to 3 mm .",
    "the vertical resolution is estimated from the height differences between two successive sampling along the same line .",
    "its magnitude is about 3 @xmath21 m .",
    "horizontal resolutions along @xmath9 and @xmath22-axis are about 5 @xmath21 m . in the case of pine",
    "an additional specimen size was tested : @xmath20 = 22.50 mm with 800 points , but only profiles far from the notch have been recorded .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists parameters of the various studied samples .",
    "as mentionned above , fractures of all specimens have been obtained at constant crack speed .",
    "subsequently , we assumed a linear relationship between the @xmath22-position of the profiles and the crack propagation time @xmath7 .",
    "height profiles are considered as descriptions of the advancing crack front @xmath5 .",
    "complete spatio - temporal evolution of the crack front can thus be produced from roughness maps .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the development of the roughness @xmath6 versus time @xmath7 in a log - log plot for different window sizes @xmath8 in the case of the spruce specimen ( s60 - 1 ) which is 60 mm wide . the upper line is a fit of the roughness growth for the largest window size ( @xmath25 mm ) .",
    "the slope of this fit provides an estimate of the ratio of the global roughness exponent and the dynamical exponent : @xmath26 .",
    "the fit is computed for times between time @xmath27 and time @xmath28 . before time @xmath27 the crack speed is not constant .",
    "after time @xmath28 , the roughness has saturated because of the reach of the system size .",
    "the lower line is a fit of the roughness measured for a small window size ( @xmath8 = 0.175 mm ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath6 increases like a power law as a function of the crack propagation time @xmath7 even for small window sizes .",
    "the slope of the fit is 0.14 significantly larger than zero and gives an estimate of the @xmath29 exponent .",
    "this unconventional dependence on time is an illustration of the anomalous scaling and differ from a family - vicsek scaling where the roughness is expected to be time independent for small window sizes .",
    "these two regimes are in good agrement with the anomalous scaling proposed in eq.([local ] ) .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed for all specimens .      the local roughness exponent @xmath0",

    "we show that this deviation is due to measurement and analysis biases and can be corrected .",
    "the reliability of the determination of self - affine exponents has already been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that several artifacts may introduce systematic errors for the estimation of the local roughness exponent .",
    "two types of biases have to be distinghished : those which happen during the geometric measurement of the object and those which are relative to the method of signal analysis .    in our study ,",
    "profiles are recorded with a needle moving along crack surfaces . for a similar type of measurement @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that shape and volume of the needle can induce a geometric filter . when the tip of the needle is a half - sphere , the needle follows hills more correctly than sharp holes .",
    "subsequently the exactness of the measured height is function of the surroundings .",
    "it has been found that an increase of the radius of the needle tip induces an increase of the measured roughness exponent ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in the case of biases relative to the analysis methods , it has been found that the accuracy of the different methods is sensitive to two parameters : the size of the system ( number of recorded points ) and the roughness exponent . in our study",
