    "recently , renewal of interest has been evoked to the fractional angular momentum ( fam ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) space in relation with the correspondence between quantum mechanical wave - functions and classical periodic - orbits@xcite .",
    "the fam is only possible in 2d multiply - connected - space , since in three- or higher - dimensional space , the angular momentum being integer or half - integer is completely determined by the commutation relation of angular - momentum operators . in 2d space ,",
    "the angular momentum operator has only one component , which does not give rise to a unique determination of the angular - momentum eigenvalue , and the common belief of integer - quantization is based on the @xmath1-periodic boundary - condition which , however , is not justified .",
    "wilczek in his pioneering work proposed for the first time a quantum mechanical model consisting of a charged particle and magnetic flux in 2d space to demonstrated the fractional eigenvalues of angular momentum known as anyon @xcite . in the existence of gauge field , however , we have both the kinetic angular momentum ( kam ) and the canonical angular momentum ( cam ) , which are different , because of the velocity - dependent forces @xcite .",
    "it is true that `` the generator of rotation should be the cam and is prescribed by noether s theorem as a conserved quantity''@xcite , which is gauge dependent and integer - quantized @xcite . while the kam is gauge invariant dynamic quantity , generally fractional because of the gauge field @xcite .",
    "although the consistence of fractional cam with the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase - interference was shown long ago @xcite it remains a long standing open question whether or not the fractional cam plays a role in quantum physics .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the gauge potential of an ab flux can only shift the angular momentum eigenvalues by a common fractional number but can not change the integer - quantization rule , namely the eigenvalue - space of angular momentum is still @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the existence of fam in a wide class of 2d central potentials without gauge field has been discussed more recently @xcite by the localization of coherent wave functions on classical orbits , which imposes a special boundary condition leading to the unusual angular phase of wave functions . following the interesting studies of ref .",
    "@xcite , which provide an exactly solvable model both quantum mechanically and classically , we consider a charged particle in the gauge field of magnetic flux - string perpendicular to the 2d plane with the central scalar - potentials in addition and study the non - integer quantization of angular momentum ( niqam ) in terms of quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "since the coherent state is constructed by the superposition of angular momentum eigenstates and thus the probability clouds have to possess the same rotational symmetry as that of classical orbits , which is not necessarily @xmath1-periodic . as a consequence the niqam with the level - space being greater or less than @xmath0 appears naturally along with the correspondence principle .",
    "by the explicit calculation it is shown that only the shift of cam eigenvalues by the gauge field , which gives rise to a common topological phase for all wave functions , is in agreement with the correspondence .",
    "the validity of wave functions with a topological phase is further confirmed by the expectation values of kam operator , which coincide with the classical values of kam @xmath2 . the long standing problem whether or not the fam is related to the cam is resolved and the quantum mechanical model of anyon proposed by wilczek @xcite emerges as a special case of @xmath3 with @xmath1-rotational - symmetry of classical orbits .",
    "more specifically , we refer here to the particular zero - energy states , which can be obtained analytically for both classical- and quantum - solutions @xcite . on the other hand the zero - energy states are of importance in various fields such as * * the cold - atom collisions@xcite , the construction of vortex lattices @xcite , and quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "we consider a charged particle of charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 in a gauge field of infinitely long magnetic flux - line of total flux @xmath6 located at the origin of 2d space and central scalar - potential of form @xcite @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    outside the flux - line ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the lorentz force on the charged particle is always zero because of the vanishing magnetic field @xmath11 , while the vector potential in the polar coordinate is seen to be @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the unit - vector of angular direction . in order to establish the quantum - classical correspondence , we ought to evoke the canonical variables . in the polar coordinates @xmath14 , the lagrangian of the system is seen to be @xmath15-ea_{0}(r)+l_{wz}%\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is so - called the wess - zumino topological interaction - term with the parameter @xmath17 being the dimensionless magnetic flux in the quantum - unit @xmath18 .",
    "the wess - zumino term does not affect the equation of motion but the initial value of angular momentum .",
    "canonical momentums corresponding to the coordinate variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 are defined by@xmath21  here @xmath22 is cam , while @xmath23 is the kam .",
    "then the hamiltonian is @xmath24 from canonical equations we find that both the cam and kam are conserved quantity @xmath25 for the case of zero - energy and nonvanishing initial kam @xmath26 we have @xmath27-e\\frac{\\gamma_{\\upsilon}}{r^{\\upsilon}}=0.\\ ] ] we assume an initial - value that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary dimensionless - quantity .",
    "thus in the considered case only the cam is shifted by the flux . introducing a dimensionless variable@xmath30^{1/\\mu}}%\\ ] ]",
    "we obtain the equation of particle trajectories such as @xcite @xmath31 the general solution of eq.(8 ) is given in ref.@xcite @xmath32 \\label{9}%\\ ] ]    using atomic unit @xmath33 with @xmath34 , which is the dimension of length , we set @xmath35 in the numerical evaluation .",
    "the classical orbits with the initial * *  * * angle setting to zero @xmath36 are shown in figs . 1 - 5 ( solid green curves ) , which depend on the initial angular momentum @xmath29 only for given scalar potential . * * in general , we have closed orbits ( figs . 1 - 4 ) for @xmath37 @xmath38 , while open trajectories for @xmath39 seen from fig.5 . from eq.(9 ) it is obvious that the rotation symmetry of classical orbits depends on the power - index @xmath40 such that the orbits are invariant under a rotation - angle @xmath41 , and @xmath1-symmetry holds only for @xmath42 .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that the angular momentum quantization can be determined only by the rotation symmetry of classical orbits based on the requirement of quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "the rotation angles of symmetry for closed orbits in figs.1 - 4 are 2@xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "in the polar coordinates @xmath47 , the zero - energy schr@xmath48dinger equation @xmath49\\psi+ea_{0}\\psi=0\\ ] ] becomes @xmath50@xmath51 by the separation of variables @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenvalue solution of angular part eq .",
    "( 10 ) is @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the normalization constant and the cam eigenvalue @xmath55 to be determined . for the usual requirement of 2@xmath43-periodic boundary - condition , @xmath56",
    ", one can obtain the integer angular momentum quantization and the normalization constant @xmath57 .",
    "however the 2@xmath43-periodic boundary - condition is not justified in the @xmath58-space , although the potential @xmath59 is symmetric under rotation .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a macroscopic quantum state , here su(2 ) coherent state @xcite can be constructed with probability density of wave functions well localized on the classical orbits for the quantum - classical correspondence , which  results in a special boundary condition of the angular momentum eigenstates such that rotational period of wave function is not necessarily 2@xmath43 but should be the same as that of classical orbits @xmath60@xcite .",
    "thus the cam eigenvalue is no longer integer but should be set as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a integer .",
    "the angular momentum now is quantized with an eigenvalue - space@xmath63 the integer - quantization is only a special case of @xmath42 .",
    "the normalization constant becomes@xmath64 the radial equation is@xmath65 in the choice of eq .",
    "( 12 ) for @xmath55 , the @xmath62-th kam eigenvalue is shifted by the flux number that @xmath66 indicating the dynamic effect of the gauge potential in contradiction with the classical solution in which gauge field does not apply a torque on the particle .",
    "we do have the other choice of @xmath55 such that@xmath67 while the kam eigenvalue @xmath68 does not depend on the flux in consistence with classical solution .",
    "the common - phase @xmath69 factor called the topological phase @xcite does not change the angular momentum quantization eq.(13 ) nor the normalization constant eq.(14 ) since whole eigenfunctions have the same additional angular phase .",
    "it is the main goal of the present paper that only the choice of cam eq.(17 ) gives rise to the exact quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "*  *      we demonstrate in this section that only the cam eigenvalues eq.(17 ) consist with the quantum - classical correspondence , such that the probability densities of coherent wave functions are well localized on classical orbits . introducing the dimensionless radius @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a quantity with dimension of length , we obtain @xmath73 where the parameter @xmath74 is defined by@xmath75 and the corresponding kam eigenvalues @xmath76 given by eq.(18 ) do not depend on the flux number .",
