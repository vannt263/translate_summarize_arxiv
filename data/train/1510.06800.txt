    "orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) technology has been widely applied in high - speed broadband wireless communication systems @xcite . in the digital terrestrial television broadcasting ( dttb )",
    "field , both european second generation digital video broadcasting standard ( dvb - t2 ) @xcite and chinese digital terrestrial multimedia broadcasting standard ( dtmb ) @xcite adopt ofdm as the key modulation technology .",
    "dvb - t2 uses cyclic prefix ( cp ) based ofdm , where a cp , serving as the guard interval , is inserted between successive ofdm data blocks to eliminate the inter - block - interference ( ibi ) caused by multipath channels @xcite . unlike dvb - t2",
    ", dtmb uses time - domain synchronous ( tds ) ofdm , which replaces the cp with a time - domain training sequence ( ts ) .",
    "compared with the classical cp based ofdm , tds - ofdm has superior performance in terms of fast synchronization and channel estimation ( ce ) , and it also achieves a higher spectral efficiency @xcite . owing to the good performance of tds - ofdm , dtmb has been officially approved as an international dttb standard , and has been successfully deployed in china and several other countries @xcite .    however , because of the mutual interferences between the ts and the ofdm data block , an iterative interference cancellation has to be used in tds - ofdm systems to decouple the ts and the ofdm data block for ce and frequency - domain demodulation @xcite .",
    "this iterative interference cancellation will result in the performance degradation under doubly selective fading channels @xcite , whereby the perfect removal of the ibis is difficult to realize . to solve this problem ,",
    "several schemes have been proposed @xcite . among these solutions ,",
    "the dual pseudo - noise ofdm ( dpn - ofdm ) has attracted more attention owing to its simplicity and its ability to deliver an accurate channel estimate without imposing complex iterative interference cancellation @xcite , at the cost of sacrificing some spectral efficiency .",
    "recently , a channel estimation method was proposed based on compressive sensing ( cs ) for the current dtmb system @xcite , whereby the small ibi - free region in the received ts is exploited to estimate the long multipath channel by exploiting    the greedy signal recovery algorithms for cs , such as the subspace pursuit ( sp ) algorithm @xcite and the compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme suffers from the drawback of high computational complexity owing to the matrix inversion operation required as well as the inevitable performance degradation under the adverse conditions of severe multipath channels with very long delay spread .    against this background , in this paper",
    "we develop a low - complexity high - accuracy cs based ce scheme for tds - ofdm systems .",
    "our contribution is twofold .",
    "firstly , we derive the overlap - add method of the ts to obtain the coarse estimates of the channel length , path delays and path gains of the wireless channel , whereby the temporal correlation of the multipath delays and multipath gains among several consecutive tds - ofdm symbols is exploited .",
    "more specifically , the ts tail part caused by the multipath channel is superposed on the preceding ts main part , and then this overlap - add result is circularly correlated with the local pn sequence to obtain some coarse channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "moreover , the temporal correlation of the multipath delays and gains among several consecutive tds - ofdm symbols is jointly exploited to improve the robustness and accuracy of the coarse ce .",
    "assisted by the prior information of the wireless channel obtained by the overlap - add method , our proposed cs based ce method , referred to as the priori - information aided iterative hard threshold ( pa - iht ) , is capable of obtaining an accurate channel estimate while only imposing a low computational complexity . in particular , unlike the classical iterative hard threshold ( iht ) algorithm @xcite whose convergence requires the @xmath0 norm of the measurement matrix being less than 1 , our pa - iht algorithm utilises the available priori information of the wireless channel to remove such a restriction as well as to reduce the number of required iterations . also benefiting from the acquired priori information of the wireless channel ,",
    "our pa - iht algorithm significantly improves signal recovery accuracy as well as considerably reduces the computational complexity , in comparison to the the existing cs based ce method , such as the modified cosamp algorithm of @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike the modified cosamp algorithm which suffers from invertible ce performance degradation under severe multipath channels with very long delay spread , the pa - iht algorithm remains robust and accurate under such adverse channel conditions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ s2 ] presents the tds - ofdm system model and briefly reviews several existing ce schemes for tds - ofdm .",
    "section  [ s3 ] details our proposed pa - iht based ce scheme for tds - ofdm , while section  [ s4 ] provides the simulation results to demonstrate the superior performance of our pa - iht algorithm over the existing state - of - the - arts .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ s5 ] .    throughout our discussions , boldface capital and lower - case letters",
    "stand for matrices and column vectors , respectively .",
    "the exception is for frequency - domain vectors , whereby the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the time - domain vector @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the linear convolution and circular correlation , respectively , while @xmath5 denotes the integer floor operator and @xmath6 is the vector whose elements are the absolute values of the corresponding elements of the vector @xmath1 .",
    "the transpose and conjugate transpose operations are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , while @xmath9 denotes the moore - penrose matrix inversion and the @xmath10 norm operation is given by @xmath11 . the @xmath12-sparse vector of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath13 which is generated by retaining the @xmath12 largest elements of @xmath1 and setting the rest of the elements to zero .",
    "the support of the vector @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denotes the entries of @xmath1 defined in the set @xmath16 , while @xmath17 denotes the sub - matrix whose columns comprise the columns of @xmath18 that are defined in the set @xmath16 .    additionally , @xmath19 denotes the absolute value , and @xmath20 is the cardinality of a set .",
    "finally , @xmath21 represents the unit impulse function .",
    "in the time domain , tds - ofdm signals are grouped in symbols , and each tds - ofdm symbol consists of a ts , which is a known pseudo - noise ( pn ) sequence @xmath22^{\\rm t}$ ] of length @xmath23 , and the following ofdm data block of length @xmath24 , which can be expressed as @xmath25^{\\rm t}$ ] with @xmath26 denoting the tds - ofdm symbol index .",
    "hence , the @xmath26th tds - ofdm symbol is represented by @xmath27{\\rm ^t}=\\big[\\mathbf{c}^{\\rm t } ~ \\big(\\mathbf{f}_n^{\\rm h }   \\boldsymbol{x}_i\\big)^{\\rm t}\\big]^{\\rm t}$ ] , where @xmath28 is the dft matrix of size @xmath29 and @xmath30^{\\rm t}$ ] is the frequency - domain @xmath26th ofdm data block .    at the receiver , the received @xmath26th ofdm symbol can be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the channel additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) vector having a zero mean , while @xmath33^{\\rm t}$ ] is the time - varying channel impulse response ( cir ) of length @xmath34 which can be considered to be quasi - static during the time period of the @xmath26th tds - ofdm symbol .",
    "since the wireless channel is sparse in nature @xcite , its cir comprises only @xmath35 resolvable propagation paths , where @xmath36 . in other words , only @xmath35 coefficients of @xmath37",
    "are non zero , and therefore the coefficients of the cir can be expressed by the following model @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40th path gain and @xmath41 is the @xmath40th path delay .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath42            for ce and data demodulation in tds - ofdm , the existing schemes may not be able to achieve satisfactory performance , especially under severe multipath channels .",
    "[ fig : tds_ofdm ] illustrates several existing ce schemes for tds - ofdm systems . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tds_ofdm ]  ( a ) , the conventional ce scheme for tds - ofdm using single pn sequence has the advantage of maintaining a high spectral efficiency .",
    "however , this scheme suffers from the mutual interferences between the pn sequence and the ofdm data block .",
    "therefore , an iterative interference cancellation has to be adopted to decouple the mutual interferences @xcite , which reduces the accuracy of ce in the doubly selective fading channel @xcite . in the dpn - ofdm scheme , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tds_ofdm ]  ( b ) , an extra pn sequence is inserted to prevent the second pn sequence from being contaminated by the preceding ofdm data block . in this way",
    ", the dpn - ofdm scheme removes the complex iterative interference cancellation and improves the ce performance , but at the cost of reducing the spectral efficiency .    the pn sequence length in a tds - ofdm system is designed to be longer than the maximum cir length in order to ensure the reliable system performance .",
    "considering the wireless scenarios that the actual cir length @xmath34 is less or even much less than the length of the guard interval @xmath23 , there is an ibi - free region of the small size @xmath43 at the end of the received pn sequence , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tds_ofdm ]  ( c ) . in this ibi - free region ,",
    "the received signal @xmath44^{\\rm t}$ ] can be represented by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the related channel awgn vector , and @xmath47_{g\\times l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a toeplitz matrix of size @xmath48 which is completely determined by the ts .    generally speaking , the ibi - free region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tds_ofdm ]  ( c ) , is usually small .",
    "thus it is difficult to obtain a unique solution to the unknown channel @xmath49 in ( [ equ : cs_euq ] ) , since the observation dimension @xmath50 is usually smaller than the cir dimension @xmath34 .",
    "fortunately , the compressive sensing theory @xcite has proved that the high dimension signal can be accurately reconstructed by the low dimensional uncorrelated observations if the target signal is sparse or approximately sparse .",
    "a wireless channel is sparse in nature @xcite and the actual number of the resolvable paths @xmath35 usually satisfies @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , even though the cir dimension @xmath34 is larger or even much larger than the observation dimension @xmath50 , we may have @xmath52 . in @xcite ,",
    "a modified cosamp algorithm is proposed to solve the under - determined equation ( [ equ : cs_euq ] ) .",
    "this scheme inherits the advantage of high spectral efficiency without changing the current tds - ofdm signal structure .",
    "furthermore , it improves the ce performance without the need of iterative interference cancellation .",
    "however , this scheme has a high computational complexity due to the required matrix inversion operations in the cs algorithm and moreover its performance degrades over severe multipath channels with long delay spread , where the observation dimension @xmath50 may become too small .",
    "in this section , we present the ce method based on the proposed pa - iht algorithm for tds - ofdm systems and also provide the complexity analysis for this ce scheme .",
    "the proposed ce method consists of four steps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : duozhenhebing ] . to be more specific , in the first step ,",
    "a coarse cir length and path delays are estimated , while in the second step , coarse channel gains are obtained . with the aid of the coarse information of the wireless channel obtained in the first two steps , the proposed pa - iht algorithm estimates the accurate path delays in the third step , and finally at the fourth step , the accurate path gains are obtained based on a maximum likelihood ( ml ) criterion .    in the first two steps",
    ", we exploit the temporal correlation of the wireless channel to estimate the coarse cir length , path delays , and path gains . for time - varying channels ,",
    "the path delays usually vary more slowly than the path gains @xcite . even for mobile scenarios , although the path gains will change over adjacent tds - ofdm symbols , the path delays may remain relatively unchanged .",
    "this is because the duration @xmath53 for the delay of a particular path to change by one tap is inversely proportional to the signal bandwidth @xmath54 , while the coherence time of the path gains @xmath55 is inversely proportional to the carrier frequency @xmath56 @xcite . since @xmath57 for all practical wireless systems , path delays change much slower than path gains , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig : dongtaiduojing ] depicts the cirs of four adjacent tds - ofdm symbols over international telecommunications union vehicular b ( itu - vb ) channel @xcite with 120 km/h receiver velocity . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dongtaiduojing ] , we observe that although the path gains are different in adjacent tds - ofdm symbols , the path delays remain nearly invariant",
    ". the characteristics of the time - varying channel over several tds - ofdm symbols can therefore be exploited to assist the coarse ce .     and the symbol rate @xmath59 .",
    "]    let us now elaborate this formally .",
    "firstly , for a time - varying channel , the path delays of the channel in the time interval length of @xmath53 , or the duration of @xmath60 tds - ofdm symbols , can be considered to remain nearly unchanged @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the cir can be considered to share the same sparsity pattern during @xmath61 tds - ofdm symbols @xcite , where @xmath62 , or in the time duration of @xmath53 the temporally common sparsity of the wireless channel is guaranteed @xcite . in practice",
    ", @xmath63 can be very large since @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the velocity of light and @xmath66 is the speed of mobile receiver , while @xmath67 is the data symbol duration which may therefore be regarded as the resolution of delays .",
    "hence we may obtain approximately @xmath68 .",
    "taking the example of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for instance , @xmath63 can be considered to be unchanged during a superframe in the dtmb system , where a dtmb superframe consists of multiple tds - ofdm symbols .    secondly , over the coherence time of the path gains , @xmath55 , the channel gains can be expressed as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the initial phase",
    ", @xmath73 denotes the time , and @xmath74 is the doppler frequency offset which can be estimated at the receiver @xcite .",
    "hence , the phase variation of a complex path gain is less than @xmath75 within the time interval of @xmath76 length , or the duration of @xmath77 tds - ofdm symbols .    in other words ,",
    "the path delays of the channel are high correlated during @xmath77 tds - ofdm symbols .    by averaging the cir estimate over @xmath78 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols , therefore",
    ", we can reduce the effects of the channel awgn and improve the accuracy and reliability of the path delay estimation .",
    "clearly , for this averaging to be effective , we must have @xmath79 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath80 .",
    "hence we may obtain approximately @xmath81 . since @xmath57",
    ", clearly we have @xmath82 . in practice ,",
    "the receiver can adaptively choose appropriate values for the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath78 based on the channel status and the estimated @xmath74 of the time - varying channel .",
    "furthermore , in order to achieve the reliable coarse channel estimation in the case of instantaneous deep channel fading occurring during @xmath78 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols , the cir estimations over the @xmath61 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols are jointly exploited to further improve the coarse estimation of the channel length and path delays .",
    "lastly , let us define the wireless channel being quasi - static during the duration of @xmath84 tds - ofdm symbols . in general",
    ", we must assume that the path delays and path gains of the wireless channel remain unchanged at least during one tds - ofdm symbol .",
    "therefore , for time - varying channels , we can choose @xmath85 .",
    "for static channels in particular where @xmath86 , both the path delays and path gains are time - invariant . we can simple choose a desired value of @xmath79 for averaging , and further set @xmath87 .",
    "we now detail our proposed pa - iht algorithm .    th tds - ofdm symbol .",
    "note that in _ step 1 _ , the length of the ts tail part is @xmath23 , while in _ step 2 _ , the length of the ts tail part is the estimated cir length . ]",
    "we propose the overlap - add method of the ts , which jointly utilizes the received tss from the ( @xmath88)th to ( @xmath89)th tds - ofdm symbols to exploit the temporal correlation of the wireless channel .",
    "the proposed overlap - add method of the ts is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] , and its operation is represented by @xmath90 in which the ts main part @xmath91 and the ts tail part @xmath92 can be expressed respectively by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the corresponding awgn vectors , while @xmath96_{m \\times l } \\ ! , \\!\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97_{m \\times l } \\ ! .",
    "\\!\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    subsequently , the overlap - add results of the ts of @xmath78 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols are averaged , and then circularly correlated with the known ts , whereby the good auto - correlation and circular cross - correlation property of the ts is exploited .",
    "specifically , we have    @xmath98    where @xmath99 represents the circular correlation of the interference plus the channel awgn with the pn sequence averaging over the ts of @xmath78 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols .",
    "note that by averaging over @xmath78 adjacent tds - ofdm symbols , the effect of the awgn is significantly reduced .",
    "consequently , the coarse ce @xmath100 is given by    @xmath101    for time - varying channels , @xmath102 estimates @xmath103 are utilized to obtain the coarse ce @xmath100 , and this reduces the effect of instantaneous deep channel fading occurring during the duration of a particular tds - ofdm symbol .",
    "for static channels , @xmath104 , and only single estimate @xmath103 is used to obtain the coarse ce @xmath100 , since the channel delays and gains are constant over adjacent tds - ofdm symbols .    finally , only the propagation path delays of the most significant taps @xmath105 are retained , and the retained @xmath106 form the resulting coarse estimate @xmath100 , where @xmath107 is the power threshold which can be determined according to @xcite . in this way , the channel length can be estimated from the coarse ce according to @xmath108    where @xmath109 is a variable parameter used to define the ibi - free region comprising the last @xmath50 samples of the received ts , which can be determined according to @xcite .    with an initial channel sparsity level given by @xmath110 ,    the channel sparsity level",

    "thirdly , the coarse path gains serve as the nonzero element values of the target signal in every iteration .",
    "by contrast , in order to obtain these values , the modified cosamp algorithm has to apply the least squares estimation with high - complexity matrix inversion operation while the classical iht algorithm uses the correlated results of the measurement matrix and the residual error @xcite , whose convergence condition requires that @xmath142 .      the final channel estimate is obtained as the ml estimate @xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a vector of length @xmath23 , whose elements outside the set @xmath145 are zeros .",

    "similar to the modified cosamp scheme , the dpn - ofdm based scheme suffers from serious performance degradation under instantaneous deep fading channel conditions as some of the estimated channel taps may be buried by the noise .",
    "furthermore , the dpn - ofdm based scheme has an additional drawback of lower spectral efficiency .            figs .",
    "[ fig : mse ] and [ fig : ber ] compare the achievable ce mse performance and the data demodulation bit error rate ( ber ) performance of the three schemes , respectively , where the dynamic channel refers to the cdt-8 or the itu - vb channel with the mobile speed of 120 km/h .",
    "the modulation scheme employed was the quadrature phase shift keying ( qpsk ) .",
    "it is clear that the existing modified cosamp based scheme achieves better performance than the existing dpn - ofdm based scheme for the itu - vb channel , but the modified cosamp based method completely fails for the cdt-8 channel .",
    "this again confirms that the modified cosamp scheme suffers from serious performance degradation under severe multipath propagation environments .",
    "the results of figs .",
    "[ fig : mse ] and [ fig : ber ] clearly demonstrate that our pa - iht based scheme significantly outperforms the two existing schemes in various wireless scenarios , especially in fast time - varying and severe multipath propagation scenarios , such as the cdt-8 channel with 120 km/h receiver velocity .",
    "more specifically , for the static itu - vb channel , the mse performance of the proposed pa - iht based scheme are more than 20db and 30db better than the modified cosamp and dpn - ofdm based schemes , respectively , while it outperforms the other two schemes by approximately 8db and 15db , respectively , for the dynamic itu - vb channel . for the dynamic and static cdt-8 channels , the mse performance attained by our method are more than 5db and 20db better than the dpn - ofdm based method , respectively .",
    "moreover , the mse performance of our proposed method is very close to the theoretical crlb for the two static channels . in terms of achievable ber , the superior performance of our scheme over the two existing ones are self - evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : ber ] , where the performance gain of our method over the existing methods is particularly noticeable under doubly selective fading channel environments .",
    "this is owing to the following reasons .",
    "the overlap - add method of the ts based on several consecutive tds - ofdm symbols significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the coarse estimates for the channel length and path delays .",
    "this provides the accurate priori information to assist the pa - iht algorithm . furthermore , the sizes of the ibi - free region and the measurement matrix are adaptive , which further improves the ce accuracy of the pa - iht algorithm .",
    "it is also worth pointing out again that the proposed scheme does not alter the current tds - ofdm signal structure and it achieves a higher spectral efficiency than the existing dpn - ofdm scheme .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a low - complexity and high - accuracy compressive sensing based channel estimation method , referred to as the pa - iht algorithm , for widely deployed tds - ofdm systems , which significantly outperforms the existing state - of - the - arts in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational complexity .",
    "the classical iht algorithm for tds - ofdm requires that the @xmath0 norm of the measurement matrix is smaller than 1 in order to guarantee convergence .",
    "by contrast , our proposed pa - iht algorithm removes such a restriction and it only requires a very few iterations .",
    "we have also demonstrated that our scheme significantly outperforms the conventional dpn - ofdm based scheme .",
    "compared with the dpn - ofdm scheme , our proposed pa - iht based scheme has the additional advantage of achieving a higher spectral efficiency and it does not alter the current tds - ofdm signal structure . compared with the existing cs based methods , such as the modified cosamp algorithm for tds - ofdm , our pa - iht algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the channel estimate while imposing a much lower computational complexity .",
    "most significantly , our scheme maintains its effectiveness under fast time - varying severe multipath environments . under such adverse channel conditions ,",
    "the existing cs based scheme for tds - ofdm fails to work completely .",
