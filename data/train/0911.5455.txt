    "strong magnetic fields have been observed in a number of stars , including classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) ( basri , marcy & valenti 1992 ; johns - krull 2007 ) , magnetic white dwarfs ( e.g. , warner 1995 ; euchner et al .",
    "2002 ) , and various types of neutron stars ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1978 ; ghosh 2007 ) . in most stars",
    "the structure of the field is unknown .",
    "it is usually suggested that the magnetic fields of gaseous stars are generated and supported by some type of the dynamo mechanism that operates in the stellar interior or in the surface layers of the star .",
    "numerical simulations of uniformly rotating , fully convective stars show the formation of complex , non - axisymmetric fields that can be represented only by a superposition of different multipoles ( e.g. , chabrier & kker 2006 )",
    ". however , in simulations of differentially rotating stars , an additional , ordered component appears ( e.g. , dobler , stix & brandenburg 2006 ) .    measurements of the surface magnetic fields of cttss using different techniques indicate that they have a complex structure ( johns - krull , valenti & koresko 1999 ; johns - krull 2007 ) .",
    "measurements of the magnetic fields of nearby low - mass stars using the zeeman - doppler technique show that their fields are often complex ( donati & cameron 1997 ; donati et al .",
    "1999 ; jardine et al .",
    "recent observations of two cttss have shown that in one star ( v2129 oph ) the surface magnetic field associated with the octupole moment dominates the fields associated with other moments ( donati et al .",
    "2007 ) , whereas in the other star ( bp tau ) the fields associated with the dipole and octupole moments are both significant and dominate the fields associated with other multipoles ( donati et al .  2008 ) .",
    "recently , the magnetic field structure of gaseous stars with complex fields has been studied analytically .",
    "it was found that the fraction of the flux through the stellar surface in open field lines is smaller in stars with complex fields than in those with purely dipolar fields ( gregory et al .",
    "2008 ; mohanty & shu 2008 ) .",
    "the potential approximation is usually used to extrapolate the surface magnetic field to larger distances .",
    "gregory et al .  ( 2006 ) calculated possible gas flows around stars with magnetic fields constructed from measurements using the potential approximation .",
    "recently , we were able to compute the flow of gas around v2129  oph and bp  tau in global 3d mhd simulations in which the magnetic field is not assumed to be given by a potential but is instead calculated as part of the simulation ( long et al .",

    "zeeman tomography of magnetic white dwarfs has shown that they also have complex magnetic fields ( euchner et al .",

    ".    neutron stars also have dynamically important magnetic fields .",
    "soon after they have formed , the magnetic fields of some may be enhanced by a dynamo mechanism ( e.g. , thompson & duncan 1993 ) and may have a complex structure . there is evidence that at least some accretion - powered x - ray pulsars have complex magnetic field structures ( elsner & lamb 1976 ; gil et al .",

    "these movements could be caused by changes in the accretion rate .",
    "earlier 3d mhd simulations of accretion onto stars with misaligned dipole magnetic fields ( romanova et al .  2003 , 2004 ) have shown that if the dipole is nearly aligned with the spin axis , the place where the accreting matter impacts the stellar surface can move prograde or retrograde relative to the surface , which favors the moving spot idea . in another model , the magnetic field of the neutron star is assumed to change in time ( burderi et al .",

    "the corona is set to rotate with the keplerian angular velocity at each cylindrical radius @xmath8 .",
    "an @xmath9-type viscosity is incorporated into the code and it operates in the disc only ( above some density level , @xmath10 ) , and helps regulate the accretion rate .",
    "we use @xmath11 for the octupole - dominated cases , and @xmath12 for the dipole - dominated cases",
    ". other parameters of the disc such as the density distribution and initial structure are fixed in all simulations .      at the inner boundary ( the surface of the star ) ,",
    "most of variables @xmath13 are set to have free boundary conditions , @xmath14 . the initial magnetic field on the surface of the star",
    "is taken to be a superposition of misaligned dipole and octupole fields ( see @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eqn .",
    "as the simulation proceeds , we assume that the normal component of the fields remain unchanged , i.e. , the magnetic field is frozen in the surface of the star .",
    "we neglect possible changes of the magnetic field structure inside the star due to , e.g. , dynamo processes , because in the most cases the time scale of such variation is much longer than the length of the simulation time .    at the outer boundary ,",
    "free conditions are taken for all variables .",
    "in addition , matter is not permitted to flow back from the corona into the region .",
    "the simulation region is large enough ( @xmath17 ) , and the disc is massive enough , to supply matter for the entire duration of the simulations .",
    "the 3d mhd equations are solved with a godunov - type code on the  cubed sphere \" grid ( koldoba et al .",
    "2002 ; see also putman & lin 2007 ) .",
    "the grid consists of @xmath18 concentric spheres , where each sphere represents an inflated cube .",
    "[ grid ] shows that the grid consists of six sectors corresponding to six sides of the cube with @xmath19 curvilinear cartesian grids on each side .",
    "the whole grid consists of @xmath20 cells .",
    "for modeling of octupole fields , a higher radial grid resolution is needed near the star compared with the pure dipole cases .",
    "we do this by choosing the radial size of the grid cells to be 2.5 times smaller than the angular size in the region @xmath21 ( see  [ ref - units ] ) , while it is equal to the angular size in the outer region as in all our previous work .",
    "the typical grid used in simulations has @xmath22 grid cells .",

    "several expressions for this radius have been derived since the 1970s for stars with dipole fields .",
    "the first estimations were done for spherically - accreting matter .",
    "it was suggested that the radially - falling matter is stopped by the magnetic pressure of the magnetosphere ( e.g. , lamb et al .",

    "for _ disc _ accretion , a similar criterion can be used but for stresses .",
    "the disk rotates in the azimuthal direction and hence main stresses are connected with the azimuthal components of the stress tensor : @xmath94 + [ b^2/8\\pi - b_\\phi^2/4\\pi]$ ] ( here we neglected the viscous stress which is much smaller than the matter stress ) .",

    "<S> , we present results of the first simulations of disc accretion onto stars with an _ octupole _ field . as examples , we consider stars with a superposition of octupole and dipole fields of different strengths and investigate matter flow around them , the shapes of hot spots on their surfaces , and the light curves produced by their rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate two possible mechanisms for producing phase shifts in the light curves of stars with complex fields : ( 1 ) change of the star s intrinsic magnetic field and ( 2 ) variation of the accretion rate , causing the disc to interact with the magnetic fields associated with different stellar magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the applicability of the potential approximation for extrapolation of the surface magnetic field to larger distances .    </S>",
