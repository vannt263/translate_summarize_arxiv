    "the strong interaction , which mediates the energy - momentum exchange between hadrons as well as partons , is described by the quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the characteristic features of qcd are the asymptotic freedom at short distance and the confinement at long distance . due to these features of qcd ,",
    "the partons behave as free particle at short distance but are confined inside hadrons on distances of the order @xmath4 1 fm . with increasing temperature or nuclear density the hadrons overlap in space , and",
    "the partons  confined before in a single hadron  now can freely move for distances that are large compared to the hadron size .",
    "the phenomenon is called deconfinement or the phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions are the experiments to realize such extreme conditions .",
    "since the hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions disappears on time scales of a couple of fm / c , it is a big challenge to investigate its properties .",
    "one can obtain information on the system by measuring bulk particles , electromagnetic probes such as direct photons or lepton pairs or hard particles .",
    "the hard particles are normally represented by jets and heavy flavors . the former are light particles with large transverse momentum and neighbours in a momentum cone , while the latter represent heavy particles which have charm or bottom flavor .",
    "since the production of hard particles requires large energy - momentum transfer , it takes place early in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , and can be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the produced hard particle interacts with the hot dense matter by exchanging energy and momentum .",
    "for example , a hard particle with large transverse momentum ( relative to the bulk matter ) loses part of its energy while passing through the medium .",
    "this results in a suppression of the @xmath2 at high transverse momentum , which is the ratio of the measured particle number in heavy - ion collisions to the expected number in the absence of nuclear or partonic matter . with increasing strength of the interaction of a hard particle with the medium",
    "the ratio @xmath2 becomes more suppressed at high transverse momentum .",
    "it has been naively expected that the @xmath2 of heavy flavor mesons is less suppressed as compared to that of light hadrons for two reasons : firstly , the scattering cross section of a heavy quark is smaller in pqcd than that of a gluon which produces e.g. a light - hadron jet .",
    "secondly , the gluon radiation from heavy quarks is suppressed due to so - called dead - cone effect  @xcite .",
    "however , experimental data show that the suppression of heavy - flavor mesons is comparable to that of light hadrons @xcite .",
    "also the elliptic flow of heavy - flavor hadrons is not small compared to that of light hadrons  @xcite and of comparable size .",
    "this sets up a puzzle for heavy - flavor production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "there have been various theoretical studies on the heavy - quark diffusion in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "most of them are based on the boltzmann equation  @xcite ; an alternative way is to solve the langevin equation  @xcite for the charm dynamics as an approximation to the boltzmann equation .",
    "the latter again is closely linked to the fokker - plank equation connecting drift and diffusion by the einstein relation at fixed temperature .",
    "since the heavy - flavor interaction is intimately related to the dynamics of the partonic or hadronic bulk matter , a proper description of the relativistic heavy - ion collisions is essential .",
    "the models describing the heavy - ion dynamics are classified into macroscopic and microscopic ones .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations are a macroscopic description which assume local thermal equilibrium and numerically solve intensive thermal quantities as functions of space and time by choosing a proper equation - of - state ( eos ) .",
    "there have been several attempts to include off - equilibrium effects by introducing viscosity or anisotropic momentum distributions of the hydro fluid . on the other hand ,",
    "microscopic approaches are based on the boltzmann equation or some extensions of it .",
    "for a review on the different approaches we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) approach , which we use in this study , differs in several aspects from the conventional boltzmann - type approaches  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the degrees - of - freedom for the qgp phase are massive strongly - interacting quasi - particles .",
    "the masses of the dynamical quark and gluon in the qgp are distributed according to spectral functions whose pole positions and widths , respectively , are defined by the real and imaginary parts of their self - energies .",
    "the latter are defined in the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) in which the strong coupling and the self - energies are fitted to lattice qcd results . due to the finite spectral width , the spectral function has time - like as well as space - like parts .",
    "the time - like partons propagate in space - time within the light - cone while the space - like components are attributed to a scalar potential energy density  @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the potential energy density with respect to the scalar density generates a repulsive force in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and plays an essential role in reproducing experimental flow data and transverse momentum spectra .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has successfully described numerous experimental data in relativistic heavy - ion collisions from the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) to large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies  @xcite ; a review on bulk and electromagnetic properties of relativistic heavy - ion reactions within phsd can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , explicit charm production has been implemented in the phsd  @xcite .",
    "the initial charm and anticharm quarks are produced by using the pythia event generator . in the qgp",
    "they interact with off - shell partons and finally are hadronized into @xmath1 mesons either through fragmentation or coalescence if the energy density is close to the critical energy density for the crossover transition ( @xmath4 0.5 gev/@xmath5 ) .",
    "the hadronized @xmath1 mesons then interact with light hadrons and finally freeze out .",
    "the phsd approach has been applied for charm production in au+au collisions at @xmath6200 gev , and the results on the @xmath2 as well as the @xmath7 of @xmath1 mesons are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data from the star collaboration  @xcite as demonstrated in ref .",

    "we recall that the spectral function with a finite width has both time - like and space - like parts  @xcite .",
    "the time - like parton propagates in space - time while the space - like one is interpreted as a virtual parton which mediates the interaction between time - like partons .",
    "the latter contributes to the potential energy density in the qgp  @xcite .",
    "the potential energy density is then separated into scalar and ( time - component ) vector parts by using the energy density and pressure of the lattice eos  @xcite . at rhic and lhc energies the scalar potential dominates by far due to approximately equal densities of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the scalar potential energy density increases with increasing temperature ( or scalar parton density ) except near @xmath76  @xcite , and thus gives a repulsive force on partons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( except close to @xmath76 or during hadronization ) .",

    "[ scatterq ] shows the distributions of charm quark scattering in the qgp as a function of collision energy for the constant mass and the off - shell mass of charm quarks in 0 - 10 % central pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev ( with the shadowing effect included ) .",
    "the scattering distributions are similar to each other except at very low @xmath70 where the number of scatterings is larger in the case of off - shell charm . as shown in fig .",
    "[ qqcrosssection ] ( b ) , off - shell charm has a sizeable scattering cross sections even below @xmath114 gev .",
    "however , it induces only little additional scatterings because the mass of the charm quark  involved in such scatterings  is much smaller than the pole position of the charm spectral function and occurs with low probability . considering that the number of produced charm quarks is about 84 and the total number of charm quark scattering 720 in 0 - 10 % centrality , one charm quark experiences on average 9 elastic scatterings before hadronization in central collisions .",
    "we have studied charm production in pb+pb collisions at @xmath62.76 tev in the phsd transport approach in continuation of our calculations for au+au collsions at the top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "the initial charm quark pairs are produced through nucleon - nucleon binary collisions by using the pythia event generator .",
    "the ( anti-)shadowing , which is a modification of the parton distributions in a nucleus , has been implemented in the phsd by using the eps09 package .",
    "we have found that ( anti-)shadowing reduces the charm quark production preferentially at low transverse momentum and at mid - rapidity .",
    "the produced charm and anticharm quarks interact in the qgp with quarks and gluons whose masses are given by spectral functions with pole positions and widths being fitted to the lattice qcd equation - of - state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "since the contribution from charm quarks to the energy density and pressure of the qgp is small , the spectral function of a charm quark can not be constrained by the lattice eos .",
    "therefore , we have studied two different scenarios : in the first case the charm quark mass is 1.5 gev independent of temperature , i.e. the charm quark spectral function is a delta function peaked at 1.5 gev . in the second case , the pole position and width of the charm spectral function",
    "are assumed to have the same temperature - dependence as those of light quarks except that the pole position is shifted by 1 gev from the pole position of a light quark .",
    "we have pointed out that our partonic cross sections reproduce the spatial diffusion constant of heavy quarks from lqcd and smoothly join with that of @xmath1 mesons in a hadron gas close to the critical temperature @xmath76 .    once the local energy density gets lower than the critical value of the crossover transition in the expansion of the system , the charm quark is hadronized into a @xmath1 meson ( or its excited states ) through either coalescence or fragmentation .",
    "the coalescence probability of a charm quark is calculated from the light antiquarks close in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "accordingly , a charm quark with a small transverse momentum has a large coalescence probability , while the one with a large transverse momentum has a small probability .",
    "if coalescence is rejected in the monte - carlo method , the charm quark is hadronized through fragmentation as in p+p reactions .",
    "the essential difference between coalescence and fragmentation is that a charm quark gains transverse momentum in the first case while it loses transverse momentum in the second one .",
    "the hadronized @xmath1 mesons then interact with hadrons in the hadron gas phase .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath1 or @xmath11 meson scattering off light pseudoscalar mesons , light baryons and antibaryons are calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy - quark spin symmetry .",
    "after several hundred fm / c , depending on collision centrality , the @xmath1 mesons freeze out , and are analyzed in momentum for the comparison with experimental data .    as a result from phsd , both the @xmath2 and the elliptic flow @xmath7 of @xmath1 mesons from the alice collaboration",
    "are reasonably reproduced .",
    "this supports the validity and consistency of the phsd approach for charm production and propagation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions in connection with our previous study at the top rhic energy within the same approach  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the shadowing effect suppresses charm production preferentially at small transverse momentum and mid - rapidity , and it helps the phsd to reproduce the ratio @xmath2 of @xmath1 mesons from the alice collaboration .",
    "the shadowing also slightly decreases the elliptic flow of @xmath1 mesons because it suppresses the production of charm quarks with small transverse momentum which more easily follow the bulk flow .",
    "finally , we have studied the effect of off - shell charm on the charm production and propagation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it has been found that the scattering cross sections are only moderately affected by the off - shell charm quarks , but the repulsive force  generated by a scalar potential energy  shifts the peak of @xmath2 of @xmath1 mesons to higher transverse momentum when assuming the same strength as for the light quarks .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data on the ratio @xmath2 of @xmath1 mesons with the actual data from the alice collaboration supports a weaker repulsive force for off - shell charm quarks than for the off - shell light quarks .",
    "phsd is a microscopic transport model that allows for the detailed study of the charm dynamics in hot and dense qcd matter within a non - equilibrium transport setting .",
    "the specific non - equilibrium features of the phsd model sets it apart from other theoretical approaches which assume thermal equilibrium .",

    "<S> the produced charm quarks interact with off - shell massive partons in the quark - gluon plasma and are hadronized into @xmath1 mesons through coalescence or fragmentation close to the critical energy density , and then interact with hadrons in the final hadronic stage with scattering cross sections calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy - quark spin symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the phsd results show a reasonable @xmath2 and elliptic flow of @xmath1 mesons in comparison to the experimental data for pb+pb collisions at @xmath3 = 2.76 tev from the alice collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effect of temperature - dependent off - shell charm quarks in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the scattering cross sections are only moderately affected by off - shell charm degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> however , the position of the peak of @xmath2 for @xmath1 mesons depends on the strength of the scalar partonic forces which also have an impact on the @xmath1 meson elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with experimental data on the @xmath2 suggests that the repulsive force is weaker for off - shell charm quarks as compared to that for light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the effects from radiative charm energy loss appear to be low compared to the collisional energy loss up to transverse momenta of @xmath4 15 gev / c . </S>"
