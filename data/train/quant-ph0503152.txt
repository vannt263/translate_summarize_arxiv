    "in recent years entanglement has been recognized as a physical resource central to quantum information processing . as a result , a remarkable research effort has been devoted to classifying and quantifying it .",
    "the first achievement in this direction was the identification of the entropy of entanglement @xcite , @xmath2 , as the unique measure of entanglement for pure bipartite states in the asymptotic limit .",
    "it was shown that that @xmath3 copies of a pure state @xmath4 can be reversibly converted into @xmath5 copies of @xmath6 by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) if , and only if , @xmath7 .",
    "this reversibility is lost however when one considers the more general picture of mixed states . in this case two",
    "different entanglement measures , associated with the formation and distillation processes , respectively , have to be taken into account .",
    "on one hand the entanglement cost , @xmath8 @xcite , is the minimal number of singlets necessary to create the state @xmath9 by locc in the asymptotic regime . on the other , the distillable entanglement , @xmath10 @xcite ,",
    "is the maximum number of singlets that can be extracted by locc from @xmath9 .",
    "another important measure connected to asymptotic properties is the relative entropy of entanglement , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is related to how distinguishable an entangled state is from a separable one and gives bounds to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the finite copy case is more complex and the entropic quantities considered above are not applicable anymore . for bipartite pure states , where the reversibility is already lost , the minimum set of entanglement measures characterizing deterministic and probabilistic transformations",
    "were derived @xcite .",
    "the mixed case , however , is known only for very restricted situations and remains mainly unsolved .",
    "another approach for the quantification of entanglement is to measure the usefulness of a state to perform a given quantum information task .",
    "for example , the maximal fidelity of teleportation achieved by single copy locc @xcite , the maximal secret - key rate attainable by local measurements in a cryptographic protocol @xcite and the capacity of dense coding @xcite , despite not being equal to any of the measures discussed so far , are clearly the best quantifiers when one of these protocols is analyzed .",
    "entanglement in multi - partite systems exhibits a much richer structure than the bipartite case and its study is even more challenging .",
    "already in the pure three qubits case , there are two different manners for a state to be entangled , in the sense that there are states that can not be converted , even with a certain probability , in each other @xcite . from the measures considered above only @xmath11",
    "is unambiguously defined to multi - partite systems , although it is not the only one .",
    "it is thus clear that entanglement is a highly complex phenomenon , which can not be quantified by only one measure .",
    "then , a natural way to measure it is to use any quantie which satisfies some particular properties , being the monotonicity under locc the most important @xcite . in this axiomatic approach",
    "any measure which does not increase , on average , under locc , called an entanglement monotone @xcite , is a good measure of entanglement and , conversely , any meaningful quantifier has to be an entanglement monotone , or at least has some sort of weaker monotonicity under locc .",
    "a closely related problem to the quantification problem is the characterization of entanglement .",
    "the very fundamental question whether a given mixed state is entangled or not is extremely difficult , being actually np - hard @xcite .",
    "a possible approach is then to consider sufficient criteria for entanglement , such as the peres - horodecki @xcite and the alligment @xcite tests .",
    "nonetheless , the strongest manner to characterize entanglement is using entanglement witnesses ( ew ) @xcite .",
    "they are hermitian operators whose expectation value is positive in every separable state .",
    "therefore , a negative expectation value in a measurement of a witness operator in an arbitrary state is a direct indication of entanglement in this state .",
    "furthermore , it was shown by the horodeckis that a state is entangled if , and only if , it is detected by an ew @xcite .",
    "a great deal of research has been devoted to the study of ews , varying from the their classification and optimization @xcite to their use in the characterization of entanglement in important , even macroscopic , physical systems @xcite .",
    "also optimal set - ups for local measurements of witnesses @xcite and experimental realizations of witnessing entanglement were realized @xcite . in spite of the determination of ews for all states being also computationally intractable @xcite , different methods from convex optimization theory",
    "can be applied to the problem , leading to efficient approximative procedures to determine and even optimize ews for arbitrary states @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to show that ews can be very helpful also in the quantification of entanglement .",
    "the first measure related to ews was due to bertlmann _",
    "et al _ @xcite and was shown to be equal to the hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of separable states .",
    "brandao and vianna @xcite took another significant step in this direction , showing that a measure derived from optimal ews of the most studied group of witnesses so far , the group of ews with unit trace , was in fact equal to the random robustness , which led to the establishment of properties still unknown for the later , such as its monotonicity under separable trace - preserving superoperators .",
    "besides the obvious benefit of increasing the number of entanglement measures known , ews based quantifiers are particular interesting due to the possibility of performing experimental measurements of them , which could be important to the extension of entanglement to other areas of physics , such as thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . moreover",
    ", despite being necessary in general a complete tomography of a state to the determination of its degree of entanglement based on an ew measure , any ew provides a lower bound to it , even when no information at all about the state is available .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the basic properties of multi - partite optimal entanglement witnesses . in sec .",
    "iii we define a class of entanglement measures based on ews , which includes several important already known quantities such as the negativity and the concurrence , and introduce a new infinite family of entanglement monotones having the generalized robustness and the best separable approximation measure as its limits . in sec iv we present further properties of the considered measures and relate them to the localizable entanglement . in sec .",
    "v it is shown how the methods developed in the last years to the characterization of entanglement based on convex optimization can be used to calculate approximately a large number of measures based on ews . in sec .",
    "vi possible extensions of our approach to gaussian states are discussed . in sec .",
    "vii we consider how the measures and their calculation are modified in states with symmetries . in sec .",
    "viii the questions of the amount of entanglement and of nonlocality in the presence of a super - selection rule are answered from the perspective of the studied measures . in sec .",
    "ix it is shown that the three most successful approaches to the quantification of entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles can be easily accessed from the ews based quanties . in sec .",
    "x and xi the questions of bounds on the teleportation distance and on the distillable entanglement of a given quantum state is review using our measures .",
    "it is shown that they provide sharper bounds than the negativity for the majority of states . in sec .",
    "xii we derive lower bounds to the entanglement of formation with any ew .",
    "possible applications of the measures are exemplified in sec .",
    "xiii , where the derivation of two thermodynamic _ equations of state _ which take into account entanglement is presented . finally , in sec .",
    "xiv we summarize our results and discuss future perspectives .",
    "we consider a system shared by @xmath14 parties @xmath15 . following @xcite",
    ", we call a @xmath16partite split a partition of the system into @xmath17 sets @xmath18 , where each may be composed of several original parties .",
    "given a density operator @xmath19 ( the hilbert space of bounded operators acting on @xmath20 ) associated with some @xmath16partite split , we say that @xmath21 is a @xmath3-separable state if it is possible to find a convex decomposition for it such that in each pure state term at most @xmath3 parties are entangled among each other , but not with any member of the other group of @xmath22 parties . for example , every 1-separable state , also called fully - separable , can be written as : @xmath23 another example is the 2-separable states of a 3-partite split given by : @xmath24 where each @xmath25 is separable with respect to at least one of the three possible partitions ( a : bc , ab : c and ac : b ) . for each kind of separable state",
    "there is a different kind of entanglement associated to it .",
    "we will say that a state is @xmath26-partite entangled if it is not @xmath3-separable .",
    "it is clear that if a state is @xmath3-separable it can not be @xmath5-entangled for all @xmath27 .",
    "it is possible to detect ( @xmath3 + 1)-partite entanglement using entanglement witnesses . in order to do that ,",
    "consider the index set @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a subset of @xmath30 which has at most @xmath3 elements .",
    "then @xmath31 is a @xmath26-partite entanglement witness if    @xmath32    equation @xmath33 assures that the operator @xmath31 is positive for all @xmath3-separable states .",
    "thus , as the subspace of @xmath3-separable density operators is convex and closed , a state @xmath9 is @xmath26-entangled if and only if there is a hermitian operator satisfying equation ( 3 ) such that @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "usually one is interest in a selected group of witnesses operators called _ optimal_. two different definitions of optimal entanglement witness ( oew ) exist .",
    "the first , introduced by lewenstein _ et al _ @xcite , is based on how much entangled states a given entanglement witness ( ew ) @xmath31 is able to detect : @xmath31 is optimal iff there is no other ew which detects all the states detected by @xmath31 and some other states not detected by @xmath31 . the second definition , due to terhal @xcite , establish the concept of oew relative to a chosen entangled state @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath35optimal entanglement witness @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the intersection of the set of entanglement witnesses , denoted by @xmath39 , with some other set @xmath40 such that @xmath38 is compact @xcite . note that every @xmath9-oew is also an oew accordingly to the first definition , whereas the converse may not be true .",
    "a general expression for entanglement witnesses was presented in @xcite .",
    "every ew acting on @xmath41-partite hilbert space can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath30 and the @xmath43 s are positive semi - definite , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the identity operator and @xmath46 is the partial transposition with respect to partie @xmath47 . note that even ( @xmath3 + 1)-partite ews can be written in the form of equation ( 5 ) @xcite .",
    "an important class of ew is the decomposable entanglement witnesses ( d - ew ) , which can always be written as : @xmath48 this class will be particularly important in our discussion , since the set of entangled states detected by d - ew is invariant under locc @xcite .",
    "in this section we show how @xmath9-optimal ews can be used to quantify all the different kinds of multipartite entanglement .",
    "first , an unifying approach , which includes several important entanglement measures ( em ) , will be presented .",
    "then we will consider a new infinite family of entanglement monotones @xcite .",
    "a general expression for the quantification of entanglement via ews is defined as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and the set @xmath40 is what distinguish the quantities .",
    "we call _ witnessed entanglement _ any measure expressed by equation ( 7 ) .    some well known em",
    "can be expressed as ( 7 ) .",
    "the first , introduced by bertlmann _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is : @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 was shown to be monotonic decreasing under mixing enhancing maps @xcite and to be equal to the @xmath54-distance of @xmath9 to the set @xmath55 of fully - separable states : @xmath56    the second is the negativity , i.e. , the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath57 ( the partial transpose of @xmath9 with respect to subsystem a ) @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath58 can be written as :    @xmath59    another quantie is the maximal fidelity of distillation under ppt - protocols , introduced by rains @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the last is the celebrated wootter s concurrence of two qubits , which can be written , accordingly to verstraete @xcite , as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the unnormalized state @xmath64 with @xmath65 , det@xmath66 .    assuming that the set @xmath40 is also convex , which is the case of all the quantities considered in this paper , except the concurrence , it is possible to apply the concept of lagrange duality from the theory of convex optimization to the problems represented by equation ( 7 ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the _ dual _ measures obtained are those related to mixing properties , such as the robustness of entanglement @xcite , introduced by vidal and tarach , and the best separable approximation measure @xcite , introduced by karnas and lewenstein . moreover",
    ", since in all the cases considered here there always exist a strictly feasible point , i.e , a @xmath67 ( denoted in the convex optimization literature by slater condition ) , the optimal solution of the primal and dual problems are the same , i.e. , the primal and dual measures are equal @xcite .    we now show that the dual representation of the generalized robustness of entanglement @xmath68 @xcite , i.e. , the minimal @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is separable , where @xmath71 is any , not necessarily separable , density matrix , is given by ( 7 ) with @xmath72 .",
    "following @xcite , the lagrangian of the problem is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "note that since the definition of ew is a composition of infinite constraints , its lagrange multiplier is a generalized function @xcite .",
    "the dual problem is then @xmath78 since @xmath79 , the integral in the constraints above is a separable state .",
    "conversely , any separable state @xmath80 is obtained with the choice of @xmath81 .",
    "it is then easily seen that the result of ( 15 ) is the generalized robustness .",
    "the dual representation of the robustness of entanglement , @xmath82 , has , instead of @xmath76 , the constraint @xmath83 .",
    "the best separable approximation measure @xmath84 @xcite is the minimum @xmath85 such that there exist a separable state @xmath86 and a density operator @xmath87 satisfying @xmath88 it can been seen that the dual representation of @xmath84 is given by ( 7 ) with @xmath89 .    in @xcite it was shown that the random robustness @xmath90 @xcite , i.e. , to the minimal @xmath69 such that @xmath91 is separable , is equal to equation ( 7 ) , with @xmath92 .",
    "this result can also be easily derived using the concept of lagrange duality .    in the next subsection",
    "we will introduce our new family of entanglement monotones      if we let @xmath40 be the set of hermitian matrices @xmath31 such that @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , then the quantity derived from ( 7 ) will be denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath95 is an entanglement monotone for every @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the final state conditional on the occurrence of the classical variable @xmath47 , which occurs with probability @xmath98 at the end of a locc protocol .",
    "it suffices to consider final states of the form @xmath99 with @xmath100 $ ] , where the kraus operators @xmath101 are given by @xmath102 and satisfy @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath41 sums only the terms such that @xmath105 is different from zero . in the last inequality we used that @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and that @xmath36 is optimal .",
    "note that the proof of proposition ( 2 ) , with minors modifications , applies also to @xmath58 and @xmath108 .",
    "the dual representation of @xmath109 is @xmath110 where @xmath111 are density matrices , @xmath86 is a separable state and @xmath112 . from ( 24 ) we find that @xmath113 actually , the equalities above are already valid when one of the numbers is sufficiently larger than the other . the elements of this new family of ems can be interpreted as intermediate measures between the generalized robustness and the best separable approximation .",
    "note that for every distinct rational number @xmath114 within a certain finite interval , the @xmath115 are genuine different ems , meaning that there is no positive number @xmath116 such that @xmath117 if @xmath118 .",
    "if we consider that @xmath40 is the intersection of set of hermitian matrices @xmath31 such that @xmath93 with the set of decomposable entanglement witnesses , a new family of entanglement monotones , denoted by @xmath119 is defined . to see that they are indeed ems ,",
    "all we have to note is that for every @xmath120 , @xmath121 is a decomposable ew whenever @xmath31 is .",
    "therefore , proposition ( 2 ) also applies to them .",
    "it is possible to derive several other families of ems considering intersections of the sets @xmath40 of different entanglement measures which can be written as equation ( 7 ) , such as those given by equations ( 10 - 12 ) .",
    "we now discuss more about the different kinds of multipartite entanglement introduced in the second section .",
    "usually the set of separable states is regarded to be composed of all sates which can be created by locc protocols . in this sense ,",
    "given a specific split and considering that each part of the split can perform global quantum operations on its subsystems , only 1-separable states can be properly identified as separable .",
    "however , one might also be interest in the situation where some of the parties are allowed to perform join operations . in this case",
    ", the different types of entanglement play an important role .",
    "consider , for example , the situation where @xmath41 parties want to create a common quantum state and each one is connected to the others via a quantum channel .",
    "if they all agree in using their channels , every state can be prepared and the situation becomes trivial .",
    "however , suppose that they agree that only @xmath122 parties will use their quantum channels , where the probabilities of which parties will be involved are given by @xmath98 .",
    "at the end of the protocol they will share an ensemble of states , @xmath123 , which clearly does not have @xmath124-partite entanglemnt . now , since erasing classical information can not create entanglement , we are lead to consider the different kinds of entanglement discussed before .",
    "this property is reflected in the condition that every goog entanglement measure should be convex , which we show for every quantity defined according to equation ( 7 )    @xmath125 is a convex function for any choice of @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath126 whenever the @xmath25 are hermitian , and @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "proposition ( 3 ) follows from the convexity and the concavity of the _ max _ and _ min _ functions , respectively .",
    "consider a given @xmath41-partite split of a multi - partite system @xmath9 .",
    "it is possible to attribute @xmath129 numbers , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , where each one quantifies one type of multi - partite entanglement of the system .",
    "it is easy to see from equation ( 3 ) that all constraints imposed to an ew which detects @xmath3-partite entanglement ( @xmath3-ew ) , are also imposed to every @xmath5-ew , with @xmath132 .",
    "hence , the following order between the @xmath130 holds : @xmath133    @xmath134 , formed by the oew with respect to the fully separable states is an upper - bound to all other @xmath135 , including those with respect to other splits formed by grouping several original parties into one .",
    "this means , for example , that in a 3-split , @xmath134 is greater or equal to the bipartite entanglement of any of the three 2-splits , namely a - bc , ab - c and ac - b . actually , it is possible to establish a complete hierarchy in the proposed measures @xcite .",
    "an interesting measure of entanglement for multi - partite systems is the _",
    "localizable entanglement _ , introduced by verstraete _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "given a quantum system of @xmath5 parties @xmath9 , the _ localizable entanglement _",
    "@xmath136 is the maximal amount of entanglement that can be created , on average , between the parties @xmath47 and @xmath137 by performing a single - copy locc protocol in the system @xcite .",
    "more specifically , if at the end of a locc protocol we have an ensemble of states @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the probability that the reduced state of the parties @xmath47 and @xmath137 is @xmath140 , the le is then given by @xmath141 where @xmath135 represents , in this paper , one measure based on oews .",
    "the le has the operational meaning which applies to situations in which out of some multipartite entangled state one would like to concentrate as much entanglement as possible in two particular parties @xcite , which could be used later , for instance , in some quantum information task .",
    "consider a multi - partite state @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath142    as in the proof of proposition 2 , it suffices to consider final states of the form @xmath143    with @xmath144 $ ] , where @xmath145 stands for the partial trace of all parties , except i and j. the kraus operators @xmath101 are given by @xmath146 and satisfy @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath147 where @xmath41 sums only the terms such that @xmath148 is different from zero . in the last inequality we used that the ew @xmath149 , @xmath150 and that @xmath36 is optimal .",
    "note that proposition ( 5 ) also applies to @xmath151 .",
    "the following relation between the negativity , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 holds :    @xmath154    for every positive operator @xmath155 , we have @xmath156 where the first ( second ) inequality is saturated for separable ( singlet ) states .",
    "hence , as @xmath157 implies @xmath158 , we find @xmath159 where we have used that the optimal decomposable ew for a bipartite system has always the form @xmath160 , @xmath161 . from equation ( 32 ) we also find that @xmath161 , @xmath162 implies @xmath163 .",
    "thus , @xmath164    the second inequality is strict for example on the state @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the maximal @xmath167 x @xmath167 entangled state .",
    "the lack of an operational procedure to calculate entanglement measures in general is ultimately related to the complexity of distinguish entangled from separable mixed states , which was shown to be np - hard @xcite . since an operational measure , which has positive value in every entangled state , would also be a necessary and sufficient test for separability , we should not expect to find one .",
    "nonetheless , some approximative numerical methods based on convex optimization have been proposed to the separability problem @xcite .",
    "what we will show in this section is that these methods can also be used to calculate , approximately , the _ witnessed entanglement_.    the first one , proposed in @xcite by brandao and vianna , linked the optimization of ews with a class of convex optimization problems known as robust semidefinite programs ( rsdp ) .",
    "although rsdps belong to np - hard , some well known probabilistic relaxations , which transforms the problem in a semidefinite program ( sdp ) , were applied , leading to a method of optimizing _ pseudo_-ews ( operators which are positive in almost all separable states ) to every multipartite state and with respect to all types of entanglement .    the second approach , due to doherty _",
    "et al _ @xcite , was actually the first method to the separability problem based on sdp . using the existence of symmetric extensions for separable states and the concept of duality in convex optimization",
    ", a hierarchy of sdps , where the @xmath168 test is at least as powerful as @xmath169 ( but demands more computational effort ) , was constructed to detect entanglement . in each step",
    "k , an oew with respect to a restricted set of ews , which converges to the whole set of ews in the limit of @xmath170 , is obtained .",
    "this method can be used , however , only for the entanglement with respect to the fully - separable states , @xmath171 . note that the further constraints that we demand to the ews can be incorporated in the sdp , since they are linear matrix ( in)equalities .",
    "the last method , introduced by eisert _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is based on recently developed relaxations of non - convex polynomial problems of degree three in a hierarchy of sdps , which converges to the solution of the original problem as the dimension of the sdp reaches the infinity @xcite .",
    "one of the applications of this method is the minimization of the expectation values of ews with respect to pure product states .",
    "therefore , it can be used together with the second method discussed to lower the value of @xmath172 , where @xmath31 is a non - optimal ew determined by some step of the hierarchy .",
    "we would like to stress the complementary character of these methods . whereas the first method usually provides upper bounds to @xmath135 , since it only determines _",
    "pseudo_-ews , the second and third provides lower bounds to @xmath135 , as the ews resulting from them are non - optimal .",
    "although only the first one can calculate @xmath173 , for @xmath174 , the number of constrains imposed grows exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in most of cases , we will restrict ourselves to the determination of @xmath171 , which is an upper bound to all other types of multi - partite entanglement ( see section iv ) .",

    "the study of entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles has been the subject of recent controversy @xcite .",
    "at least three different approaches to the problems have been proposed , namely , the _ entanglement of modes _",
    "@xcite , the _ quantum correlations _ @xcite and the _ entanglement of particles _ @xcite . each of these has its own advantages and drawbacks , and no consensus has been reached on which one is the most suitable . in this section",
    "we show how the proposed measures based on ew can be used to quantify entanglement in each of the three methods .",
    "we start with the _ entanglement of modes _ , proposed by zanardi @xcite , which suggests that the entanglement of indistinguishable particles should be calculated by any regular entanglement measure , using the density matrix in the mode - occupation , or fock , representation . in this case",
    "it is clear that the determination of the witnessed entanglement follows straightforwardly .",
    "the _ quantum correlations _ , introduced by schliemann _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is motivated by the believe that no quantum correlations due to symmetrization ( for bosons ) or anti - symmetrization ( for fermions ) should be considered as true entanglement .",
    "then , the characterization of entanglement , for pure states , is determined by the slater rank of the state , as opposed to the schimdt rank usually considered in distinguishable particles .",
    "furthermore , schliemann _ et al _ have shown that the concept of entanglement witness is also applicable to multipartite systems of indistinguishable particles @xcite and , thus , the witnessed entanglement are well defined in this case too .",
    "the last approach , due to wiseman and vaccaro @xcite , is probably the best motivated one .",
    "the _ entanglement of particles _ is defined as the maximal amount of entanglement , computed by a standard measure , which alice and bob can produce between a quantum register , shared by them , composed of distinguishable particles by local operations .",
    "the amount of entanglement will clearly depends on the physical constraints imposed , which are in most of cases expressed as a ssr .",
    "therefore the approach presented in the previous section to ssr can also be applied in this case .",
    "in this section we derive lower bounds to the teleportation distance , using @xmath95 .",
    "we consider a quantum state @xmath9 shared by @xmath41 parties and ask what is the best possible teleportation distance attained by a locc protocol when the parties form two groups and teleport a quantum state from one group to the other .",

    "equation ( 57 ) is saturated , for example , on the @xmath41-partite ghz state @xmath336 .",
    "we now move on to show another application of the family @xmath337 , namely bounds to the distillable entanglement of bipartite mixed states .",
    "we first derive the following additivity property    @xmath338    consider the dual representation ( 24 ) of @xmath339 .",
    "let s , t , @xmath86 , @xmath340 and @xmath341 be variables which minimize ( 24 ) .",

    "it is exactly the possibility of measure experimentally the amount of entanglement , which is a feature shared by all common thermodynamics variables , that makes quantities expressed by ( 7 ) useful to the study of entanglement thermodynamical properties . in this section",
    "we present , as an example , the study of entanglement in the xxx heisenberg model with and without a magnetic field using @xmath311 .",

    "we , thus , use the following ansatz for the optimal entanglement witness for the thermal states , at very low temperatures , of hamiltonians ( 79 ) and ( 80 )    @xmath389    where the factor 2@xmath14 in the denominator comes from @xmath76 . note that this is the ew introduced by toth _",
