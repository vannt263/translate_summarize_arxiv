    "the updated results are consistent with the expectation of a higgs boson  @xcite , the missing cornerstone of particle physics . in order to directly test whether the higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , we need to determine the higgs self - coupling constants @xmath4 directly from data by observing the double higgs production process @xmath5 . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", the higgs self - coupling @xmath4 is equal to @xmath6 where @xmath7 gev and @xmath8 is the measured higgs boson mass .",
    "an accurate test of this relation may reveal the extended nature of the higgs sector , which can be achieved by observing a significant deviation from the sm prediction above  @xcite .",
    "recent studies indicate that observing @xmath9 is challenging at the high luminosity run of lhc ( hl - lhc ) with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath2  @xcite , due to destructive interference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 processes that are shown in fig .",

    "we study how feasible it is to measure higgs self - coupling at the lhc and the future higher energy colliders(vlhc ) .",

    "the advantage of measuring the higgs self - coupling at the higher energy colliders is their large production cross section rate as shown in fig .",

    "recent studies indicate that the resummation effects will further increase the nlo cross section by 20%-30% and reduce the scale uncertainties  @xcite , which would improve the chance of measuring the higgs self - coupling at hl - lhc .",
    "following the community summer studies 2013 ( css 2013 ) guidelines , we use delphes  @xcite v3.0.10 to simulate the atlas detector responses . more specifically , the photon energy is smeared according to the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) responses of @xmath12 .",
