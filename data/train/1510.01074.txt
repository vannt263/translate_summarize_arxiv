    "the bose - hubbard model is a widespread paradigm in the field of strongly - correlated many - body systems  @xcite . over the years",
    "it has found applications in the physics of superconducting thin - films  @xcite , josephson junction arrays  @xcite , optical cavity arrays  @xcite , and cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the model describes bosons hopping on a tight - binding lattice and interacting through an on - site repulsion .",
    "the non - trivial properties of the model stem from the competition between the hopping ( that delocalizes the particles ) and the local repulsion ( that tends to suppress local particle number fluctuations ) . in the absence of disorder",
    "such a competition dictates a quantum phase transition at integer filling : if the hopping dominates , the ground state of the system is superfluid ; in the opposite regime , there is a gap in the excitation spectrum and the system is in a mott insulating state . at a critical value of the ratio between the hopping and the repulsion parameters , an insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition takes place at zero temperature . in optical lattices",
    "this transition has been experimentally demonstrated in the seminal work by greiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model has been studied by a number of analytical and numerical methods , a recent account of the properties of this model together with a review of the experimental advances with cold atoms can be found in the reviews  @xcite .    in one dimension ( 1d ) , which is the case of interest for the present work , the quantum phase transition between the mott insulating ( mi ) phase and the superfluid ( sf ) phase at fixed commensurate lattice filling is known to be of the berezinkii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite .",
    "the critical properties of the quantum model map onto that of a classical two - dimensional @xmath0 model .",
    "the hallmark of a bkt transition  @xcite is a universal jump  @xcite in the superfluid density ( or stiffness or helicity modulus  @xcite ) .",
    "extensive studies of the stiffness in the classical 2d @xmath0 model are reported for example in  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the one - dimensional quantum model ( the mapping onto the @xmath0 model becomes accurate at large fillings ) were performed originally in  @xcite , more recent results are comprehensively discussed in  @xcite . on the other hand , the density matrix renormalization group alias matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite has been applied to the model under consideration  @xcite , although the superfluid stiffness is difficult to extract with high precision because these methods are not ideally suited to deal with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc )  @xcite .",
    "the presence of disorder enriches the phase diagram with a new phase , the bose glass ( bg )  @xcite , surrounding a superfluid lobe in the interaction vs. disorder plane of the phase diagram . in absence of interactions , indeed , the disorder induces anderson localization of single particle states and therefore an insulating phase .",
    "this is then lifted by a moderate amount of interactions that tend to reestablish coherence and consequently superfluidity . at large interactions and large disorder ,",
    "finally , strong correlations should lead back to an insulating phase , distinct from the above mentioned mott insulator in the clean setup .",
    "although this picture is qualitatively well - understood , the full quantitative characterization of the disordered bose - hubbard model remains challenging : considerable efforts have been devoted to study its phase diagram , in particular the location and the nature of the glassy phase  @xcite . developments on the issue , with a special emphasis on numerical simulations , have been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment with optical lattices has made an important step forward in mapping the phase diagram from weak to strong interactions  @xcite .    in the present work",

    "we compute the superfluid stiffness and correlation functions , avoiding the detrimental boundary effects arising in simulations with open boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing the statistics of the decay of superfluid correlators we are able to locate the superfluid to bose glass transition line , to extend it into the previously numerically unexplored regime of small on - site interactions , and to confirm the monte carlo results of ref .",
    "@xcite for strong interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the model and give a brief overview of the used numerical technique ( a detailed discussion can be found in  @xcite ) and we anticipate the main result of the paper , the phase diagram of the disordered bh model at unit filling . in section  [ sssection ]",
    "we analyze the superfluid stiffness . as a benchmark we first consider the case without disorder where we are able to perform a very accurate finite - size scaling to locate the bkt transition .",
    "we compare the obtained transition point with the results from other well - known methods for determining the mi - sf transition , such as numerically extracting the luttinger parameter from the hopping correlation functions @xcite , finding very good agreement . moreover , we present our results for the average stiffness in the disordered case . in order to get",
