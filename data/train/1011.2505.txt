    "however , @xmath10 have different transformation properties than @xmath11 . while in hydrodynamic turbulence",
    "the local average velocity can always be excluded by the choice of reference frame , in mhd @xmath10 always contain the average local mean magnetic field that can not be excluded .",
    "this leads to a situation when large scale magnetic field is much stronger than small - scale turbulent perturbations and dynamics is dominated by this local mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "but turbulence does not become weaker down the cascade as was proposed in aforementioned models . a proper perturbation theory @xcite revealed that mhd turbulence has a tendency of becoming stronger on smaller scales , rather than weaker , due to the fact that the cascade increases perpendicular wavenumber @xmath12 , keeping parallel wavenumber @xmath13 constant .",
    "the `` strength '' of turbulence , as the ratio of the mean - field term to the nonlinear term can be approximated as @xmath14 and can increase due to the increasing anisotropy of perturbations @xmath15 down the cascade . as turbulence becomes marginally strong ( @xmath16 ) , i.e. , the linear term is comparable to the nonlinear term , the cascading timescales become close to the dynamical timescales @xmath17 .",
    "however , as was argued in @xcite , the perturbation frequency @xmath18 has a lower bound due to an uncertainty relation that follow from the uncertainty in the _ direction _ of the @xmath19 vector @xcite , give the same estimate in the case of _ balanced _ turbulence considered in @xcite .",
    "in the _ imbalanced _ case it could lead to a modified relation . ] @xmath20 , therefore the combination of this lower bound , that limits the strength of turbulence @xmath21 and the tendency of turbulence to become stronger will make it `` critically balanced '' with @xmath22 .",
    "this critically balanced cascade is strong in a sense that cascading timescale is always of the order of the dynamic timescale and will , therefore , have a kolmogorov -5/3 spectrum .",
    "these critically balanced perturbations will be strongly anisotropic with respect to the local mean magnetic field . using @xmath16 and @xmath23 one obtains @xmath24 , i.e. the anisotropy will increase towards small scales without limit .",
    "one can further simplify eq . 1 by neglecting the term @xmath25 which is much smaller than the mean field term @xmath26 .",

    "[ mhd ] splits into two equations , one for @xmath27 , which , in this strongly anisotropic case , @xmath28 represents slow ( or pseudo - alfvn ) mode and the equation for @xmath29 which represent alfvnic mode .",
    "the equation for slow mode is passive and does not provide any back - reaction for the alfvnic equation which could be written in the following form :    @xmath30    one can study this purely alfvnic dynamics and assume that the omitted slow mode has similar cascade and similar statistical properties .",

    "indeed , as long as one increases @xmath31 and stretches the fields in the parallel direction , decreasing @xmath32 , by the same factor , eq . 2 will be unchanged .",
    "furthermore , a kolmogorov argument of universality of nonlinear dynamics at each scale , which is based on a two - parametric scaling symmetry , could be amended it with a proper scaling for the anisotropy :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a perpendicular scale , @xmath35 is a parallel scale , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are arbitrary parameters . due to this precise symmetry",
    "one can hypothesize that strong alfvnic turbulence has a universal regime , utilizing the same argumentation as @xcite . in nature",

    "note , that as we see above , both mhd and rmhd dynamics are essentially three - dimensional . in this paper",
    "we use both full mhd simulations and rmhd simulations .",

    "r1 - 3 were started from lower - resolution simulation that reached stationary state and were further evolved in high resolution for approximately 12 alfvnic times , which , for strong mhd turbulence also correspond to about 12 dynamical times .",
    "the averaged quantities were obtained for the last 6 alfvnic times . in all magnetic simulations m1 , r1 - 3 , we were using hyperviscosity ( @xmath51 ) instead of normal viscosity .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that bottleneck effect is much less pronounced in the mhd case , compared to hydro .",
    "much of the study of hydrodynamic turbulence was dedicated to kolmogorov model which assumes a universal cascade of energy through scales @xcite .",

    "a physical meaning of such a comparison is based on an assumption that a simulation with higher numerical resolution can be considered both as a simulation resolving smaller physical scales and as a simulation of a larger volume of turbulence ( see fig .",

    "this is consistent with the range of @xmath34 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .     of strong mhd turbulence ( gs95 slope ) .",
    "]    we are not aware of any convincing physical argumentation explaining why alignment should be a power - law of scale .",
    "@xcite provides an explanation arguing that alignment will tend to increase indefinitely , but will be bounded by field wandering , i.e. the alignment on each scale will be created independently of other scales ( hence the term `` dynamic alignment '' ) and will be proportional to the relative perturbation amplitude @xmath73 . but",
    "this directly violates precise symmetry of eq .",
    "[ rmhd ] , i.e. eq .  [ symmetry ] which states that nothing should depend on @xmath73 as long as other quantities are scaled properly .",
    "physically , this means that field wandering can not destroy alignment or imbalance . indeed",
    "a perfectly aligned state , e.g. , with @xmath74 is a precise solution of eq .",
    "[ rmhd ] and it is not destroyed by its own field wandering .",
    "additionally , @xcite measured alignment in simulations of strong mhd turbulence with different values of @xmath75 and found very little or no dependence on this parameter .",
    "[ align ] also compares alignment measure with a first - order structure function of the perturbation amplitude , i.e. @xmath76 . according to @xcite they should scale the same way , but this is not observed .    to summarize , our numerical data are consistent with alignment measures becoming constant in the inertial range and inconsistent with the hypothesis that they depend as @xmath69 on scale .",
    "this finding is important , because if alignment is constant on scale in the asymptotic regime , there is no reason to expect that the power - law scaling of turbulence will deviate from its @xmath1 value for strong goldreich - sridhar turbulence .",
    "this result is further supported by the results of the previous section where a steeper asymptotic spectra has been observed .",
    "full incompressible mhd turbulence have a cascade of slow mode , which was not included in our reduced mhd simulations r1 - 3 .",
    "although in nature slow mode is often damped , it is normally present in full mhd incompressible simulations , e.g. the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "the passive cascade of slow mode will have the same energy spectral slope as a alfvnic mode , and , assuming that the ratio of slow to alfvnic energies is @xmath77 , the _ total _ kolmogorov constant for mhd turbulence will be expressed as    @xmath78    the ratio @xmath77 is supposedly depend on how the mhd turbulence is driven .",
    "however , historically , previous studies simulated mhd turbulence with zero mean field , either decaying or driven with statistically isotropic forcing , e.g. @xcite . in this idealized case kolmogorov constant has been measured , although with fairly limited resolution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use a less straightforward approach , by measuring @xmath77 from a simulation with zero mean field and substituting it into eq .",
    "this approach is motivated by our finding that mhd turbulence is less local and therefore it is much harder to achieve an asymptotic universal cascade if one uses zero - mean field simulation .",
    "indeed , one has to observe the transition to the strong local mean field case , which will require at least a couple of order of magnitude in scale and subsequently a transition to universal cascade , which as we observed in previous section , takes about two orders of magnitude in scale , as long as the power - law scaling and kolmogorov constants are concerned .",
    "it is , therefore , impossible to directly measure the properties of universal cascade in zero mean field simulations of currently available simulations .",
    "the `` natural '' value of @xmath77 is unity , because the incompressible mhd equations have four degrees of freedom , out of which alfvnic mode uses two and slow mode also uses two .",
    "having the same amount of degrees of freedom and the isotropic driving that does not prefer any direction we would expect that the energy will be distributed equally between the modes .",
    "we measured how energy is partitioned on small scales of simulation m1 by making a local fourier transform of smaller cubes and decomposing into modes with respect to the local mean field .",
    "the actual partition of energy shows @xmath77 being around @xmath79 .",
    "although statistical errors in this measurement are small , it is hard to claim a particular value of @xmath77 based on a numerical simulation with a finite resolution .",
    "conservatively , we will assume that @xmath77 is between @xmath80 , which is equipartition , and @xmath79 , which is observed in our simulation m1 .",
    "the total kolmogorov constant will be estimated as @xmath81 .",
    "the energy flux through scales in both mhd and hydrodynamic turbulence can be expressed as a certain third order _ signed _ structure function divided by scale and has to be scale - local due to an upper analytical bound on contributions from different @xmath50 wavebands ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this upper bound , however , is well applicable to similar third order _ unsigned _ structure function .",
    "this _ unsigned _ third order structure function is related by self - similarity hypothesis to second order structure function , which is a measure of energy .",
    "therefore , we would expect that the ratio of _ unsigned _ third order structure function to the signed one will scale approximately as @xmath82 .",
    "this seriously limits the bound on scale locality from practical standpoint as long as @xmath54 becomes large , i.e. , the energy transfer becomes less efficient @xcite .",
    "indeed , if the define `` scale locality '' as a ratio of largest to smallest wavevectors @xmath83 which still significantly contribute to energy flux through some central wavevector @xmath84 , then this ratio will have an upper bound that scale asymptotically with kolmogorov constant as @xmath85 . in other words , inefficient energy transfer can still be very local , but it is also possible that it is less local than efficient energy transfer .",
    "a nonlocal or diffuse energy transfer _ must _ be inefficient and _ must _ have a high value of kolmogorov constant .    a comparative study of energy spectra in mhd and hydro turbulence in @xcite revealed that the bottleneck effect is less pronounced or altogether absent in mhd simulations , while in hydro it is always present , both in simulations with normal ( @xmath86 ) and hyperviscosity ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as an indication that mhd cascade is less local .",
    "now , our measurement of kolmogorov constant revealed that mhd energy transfer is less efficient , therefore mhd cascade may be less local than hydro cascade . in view of all numerical evidence available today , mhd cascade is most likely less local than hydro cascade .",
    "previous measurements of the slope usually relied on the highest - resolution simulation and fitted the slope in the fixed @xmath50-range close to driving scale typically between @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this paper",
    "we argue that such a fit is unphysical and instead one should fit a fixed @xmath59 range . in the former case",
    "the result would be a shallower spectral slope due to proximity to the outer scale and driving . in the latter case the effect of the driving will diminish with increasing resolution and one will observe shallower spectra at small resolutions that will become steeper with increasing resolution .",
    "earlier measurements of kolmogorov constant in mhd turbulence reported lower values than this study , e.g. @xmath89 in @xcite .",
    "we believe this is due to insufficient resolution in those simulations , which prevented the observation of the asymptotic regime . in particular ,",
    "in the case of statistically isotropic simulations like the ones in @xcite a transition to small scale subalfvnic regime precede the transition to asymptotic regime .",
    "these two transitions require numerical resolution that is even higher than the highest resolution presented in this paper and for now seems computationally impossible .",
    "our own statistically isotropic simulation m1 shows kolmogorov constant of 3.5 , which is still only a lower limit , consistent with 4.1 derived in this paper . for m1 and similar lower - resolution simulations",
    "the estimate of @xmath54 continues to grow with increasing resolution , which supports argumentation above .    in this paper",
    "we treated so called balanced case , where the rms amplitudes of the @xmath90 were statistically the same .",
    "a number of attempts to generalize the gs95 model has been made recently @xcite .",
    "some of these models can be rejected by numerics , in particular the model based on alignment @xcite is grossly inconsistent with the dissipation rates measured in imbalanced numerical simulations @xcite ."
