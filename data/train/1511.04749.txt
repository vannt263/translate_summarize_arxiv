    "measuring the ionic current passing through a nanometer - scale membrane pore has emerged over the past couple of decades as a versatile technique to study nanometer - scale transport processes @xcite . in particular , nanopores are being used to study the properties of translocating biological molecules ; to count them , measure their size and translocation velocity , or even  in the case of dna  determine their sequence @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of such measurements is limited by the noise level , which typically increases with decreasing frequency @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio , as well as a consistent noise spectrum across individual devices , are among the requirements for a nanopore system to be of practical use .",
    "apart from limiting the measurement accuracy , however , the noise level can sometimes be used to study the microscopic properties of a nanofluidic system , such as the adsorption of molecules on the walls of a nanometer - scale cavity @xcite . at low frequency , the power spectrum @xmath3 of the ionic current through an electrolyte - filled nanopore typically follows a power law @xmath4 with @xmath5 , which is referred to as pink noise , or flicker noise , or @xmath6 noise @xcite . at high frequency , @xmath3 is dominated by thermal or capacitive noise @xcite .",
    "ever since the discovery of the near - universal appearance of pink noise in electrical systems , its microscopic origins have been heavily debated .",
    "measurements in protein channels indicate that the pink noise in biological nanopores is related to small conformational fluctuations of the open nanopore @xcite .",
    "these results are supported by experiments on nanopores in membranes with varying flexibility , showing pink noise in pores in flexible membranes , and a quadratic noise spectrum ( @xmath7 ) in pores in solid membranes @xcite .",
    "other explanations of pink noise include surface charge fluctuations @xcite and the rectifying nature of conical pores @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the noise is thought to originate not in the properties of the nanopore , but instead in the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge carriers under confinement .",
    "the first of these possible explanation stems from hooge , whose measurements on homogeneous metal samples showed that the amplitude of the pink noise is proportional to the concentration of mobile charge carriers @xcite .",
    "further evidence is provided by the observation that stationary confining walls affect the velocity autocorrelation function of colloidal particles at long time scales @xcite .",
    "fractional brownian motion , which can be used to describe pink noise , also governs subdiffusive motion of molecules under confinement @xcite .",
    "based on careful analysis of noise measurements in solid - state nanopores filled with ionic liquids , tasserit _ et al .",
    "_ reached the conclusion that pink noise is caused by a cooperative effect in the ionic motion @xcite . in computer simulations",
    ", pink noise has only been observed in nanochannels when the single - file motion is enforced artificially @xcite .",
    "identifying the source of noise in nanopores is essential for efforts to optimize experimental setups , and to design nanopore systems for use in large - scale technological applications .",
    "moreover , a comprehensive understanding of the power spectrum of nanopore ion currents would constitute the basis of a new probe of the pore s microscopic properties , allowing researchers to extract a wealth of information from a part of the measured signal that has traditionally been discarded .",
    "however , a systematic theoretical investigation of the noise spectrum in nanopores filled with an aqueous electrolyte has been lacking so far .    in this paper , we present the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonequilibrium noise spectrum of an ion current through a rigid nanopore using implicit water .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the noise spectrum in the mean - field regime , providing a tool to analyze and interpret experimental results in both the high and the low frequency limits .",
    "we compare our analytical expressions with the results of langevin dynamics simulations , showing excellent agreement at high frequency .",
    "although the low frequency results follow our theoretical linearized mean - field prediction at low ion concentration , at high ion concentration the simulation results deviate from the linearized mean - field prediction , and show a nonzero @xmath8 , indicative of pink noise .",
    "our results suggest that ion correlations are a source of pink noise in nanopores .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a cylindrical nanopore of length @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 connecting two reservoirs . because the ion current through the system is ultimately determined by the flux through the pore , we base our model on the ion flux density @xmath11 inside the nanopore , with @xmath12 denoting the position in three dimensions and @xmath13 denoting the time .",
    "we model the electrolyte filling the nanopore as ions of valency @xmath14 in implicit water .",
    "note that the model implies that nonlinear terms originating in the coupling of the ionic motion to the fluid velocity are ignored .",
    "the ion concentrations @xmath15 are governed by the continuity equation , @xmath16 the corresponding flux densities @xmath11 are given by the nernst - planck equation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the applied electric field , @xmath19 denotes the ion charge , and @xmath20 denotes the thermal noise that accounts for fluctuations in the environment , most importantly the effect of collisions between water molecules and ions . from here on , we restrict ourselves to the case where the ion diffusion coefficients are equal , @xmath21 , which is accurate for many common salts , such as kcl and kno@xmath22 . because of the cylindrical geometry we have only two independent coordinates , one parallel to the length of the pore ( @xmath23 ) an one perpendicular to the pore wall ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "<S> , the linearized mean - field theory accurately captures the dependence of the simulated power spectral density on the pore radius and the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the linearized mean - field theory predicts a plateau in the power spectral density at low frequency @xmath0 , which is confirmed by the langevin dynamics simulations at low ion concentration . at high ion concentration , however , the power spectral density follows a power law that is reminiscent of the @xmath1 dependence found experimentally at low frequency . </S>",
    "<S> based on simulations with and without ion - ion interactions , we attribute the low - frequency power law dependence to ion - ion correlations . finally , we show that the surface charge density has no effect on the frequency dependence of the power spectrum . </S>"
