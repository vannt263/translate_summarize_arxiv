    "the experiments with interacting ultracold atomic gases loaded in various external potentials offer great opportunities for probing versatile many - body states ( e.g. see @xcite for a review ) , from weakly interacting gases up to strongly correlated states .",
    "interactions between the atoms can be tuned in some cases ( e.g. , by employing feshbach resonances ) , while external potentials can assume various shapes including optical lattices , elongated and transversely tight traps and many others .",
    "systems of interacting atoms in double - well potentials exhibit particularly interesting phenomena which were studied over the years , for example , a bosonic josephson junction @xcite , squeezing and entanglement of matter waves @xcite , matter wave interference @xcite , and recently exact many - body quantum dynamics in a one dimensional ( 1d ) quantum well @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on a strongly interacting bose - fermi mixture of particles in a 1d double well potential .",
    "the achievement of quantum degeneracy in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite has stimulated many studies of these systems . in 1d geometry , several theoretical approaches explored such mixtures .",
    "for example , the mean - field approximation has been utilized to study phase separation @xcite . however , for strongly correlated systems , which are more likely to occur in one- than in three - dimensional systems , the mean field approach is not appropriate .",
    "these systems can be studied by using exactly solvable models and/or sophisticated numerical calculations .",
    "luttinger liquid theory has been used to study pairing instabilities and phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations were used to obtain phase diagram for mixture with unequal masses @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional bose - fermi mixture with a finite coupling strength and without an external trapping potential were studied in refs .",
    "recently , an exactly solvable model describing 1d bose - fermi mixture with strong interactions has been studied in ref .",
    "the ground state wave functions for arbitrary external potentials were constructed ; in the model , strong ( `` impenetrable core '' ) interactions are present between bosons , bosons and fermions , whereas fermions are mutually noninteracting and they are spin - polarized .",
    "the correlation functions including the one - body density matrix were addressed for the ring geometry and the harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "the ground state properties and expansion dynamics were further explored in ref .",

    "we study ground state properties of a strongly interacting bose - fermi mixture in a double - well potential ; we use the model from ref . @xcite . as a first step ,",
    "we derive a formula which enables efficient calculation of the rspdm for mesoscopic mixtures in various potentials ; it reduces to a calculation of rspdm for tg bosons @xcite in an incoherent mixed state .",
    "the formula is employed to calculate the rspdm , momentum distributions , natural orbitals and their occupancies , for ground state of the mixture in a double - well . for mesoscopic systems",
    ", we find that the ground state properties qualitatively differ for mixtures with even number of particles ( both odd - odd and even - even mixtures ) in comparison to mixtures with odd particle numbers ( odd - even and even - odd mixtures ) .",
    "for even mixtures the momentum distribution is smooth , whereas the momentum distribution of odd mixtures possesses modulations ; the differences are observed also in the off - diagonal correlations of the rspdm , and in the occupancies of natural orbitals .",
    "we study a mixture of @xmath0 bosons and @xmath1 spin - polarized fermions in one - dimensional geometry , in a ground state of an external potential @xmath2 .",
    "bosons and fermions experience the same external potential , and their masses are assumed to be approximately equal .",
    "this condition can be satisfied for combination of bosonic and fermionic isotopes of the same element , such as @xmath3 , or @xmath4 with several stable isotopes , and @xmath5 ( for detailed discussion , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bosons interact via a very strong repulsive contact potential , that is , their interaction is in the tonks - girardeau regime .",
    "fermions are mutually noninteracting .",
    "interaction between bosons and fermions is also a very strong repulsive contact potential .",
    "the total number of particles is denoted with @xmath6 .",
    "the ground state for this system for finite but very strong interactions can be approximately written as @xcite : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 denotes a slater determinant wave function constructed from the single particle wave functions @xmath9 , which are the @xmath10 lowest single - particle eigenstates of the potential @xmath2 : @xmath11 @xmath12 . in eq .",
    "( [ slater ] ) , @xmath13 denotes a permutation from the group @xmath14 . for the clarity of the exposition ,",
    "it is convenient to define the following quantities .",
    "let us consider a subset of single particle states , chosen from the set @xmath15 by crossing out @xmath16 single - particle states ; let @xmath17 denote the indices of the crossed states , and @xmath18 the indices of the remaining states ( obviously @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "we define the slater determinant state @xmath21 where @xmath13 is a permutation of indices @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the indices upon @xmath23 denote the crossed out states , rather than the ones used in the slater determinant .",
    "let @xmath24 denote a symmetric tonks - girardeau state obtained by acting with a unit antisymmetric function @xmath25 upon @xmath23 .",
    "the rspdm of the state @xmath26 will be denoted by @xmath27 , @xmath28 the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 etc .",
    "will refer to states and the correlation functions obtained from the full set of single particle states @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in properties of the ground state of the bose - fermi mixture described by the state ( [ gs ] ) . to explore the one - particle observables of this bose - fermi mixture",
    ", we need to construct the rspdm of the bosonic and the fermionic subsystems , respectively .",
    "the one - body density matrix for the bosonic part of the mixture is defined as @xmath32 it is straightforward to verify that @xmath33 can be calculated from the rspdm describing @xmath10 tonks - girardeau bosons , @xmath34 .",
    "this correlation function can be efficiently calculated by using the procedure derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the density matrix describing the fermionic component of the mixture , @xmath35 is much more involved .",
    "the derivation can be reduced to calculations of the rspdm for an incoherent mixed tg state as follows :    @xmath36    the determinants above can be expanded along their 2nd row according to the laplace formula , after which the integral over @xmath37 is trivially performed :    @xmath38    where we have used @xmath39 .",
    "the index @xmath40 in @xmath41 means that the single - particle state @xmath42 has been crossed out from the slater determinant used in the formula for the ground state , see sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] .",
    "thus , we have derived a recursion formula which reduces the calculation of the fermionic rspdm @xmath43 , to the calculation of @xmath10 fermionic correlation functions , @xmath44 ( with one fermion less in the mixture ) . by successively applying the recursive formula above ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath45 the correlation functions @xmath46 correspond to a mixture with one fermion and @xmath0 bosons ; it is straightforward to see from the definition of @xmath47 that @xmath48 , i.e. , the system with just one extra fermion has identical rspdm ( up to a normalization constant ) to the system with @xmath49 tg bosons placed in the proper single particle orbitals .    thus , the density matrix @xmath43 is equal ( up to a proportionality constant ) to a sum of density matrices of tg states from an ensemble . each tg state from the ensemble describe @xmath49 tg bosons ; these states are constructed by choosing @xmath49 orbitals from the full set of single particle states @xmath15 .",
    "apparently , there are @xmath50 such states , i.e. , there are @xmath50 terms in the sum ( [ final ] ) .",
    "thus , the density matrix @xmath43 is equivalent to the density matrix of @xmath49 bosons in a mixed tg state ; the mixed state is an incoherent superposition of the ground state and many excited tg states , each of which is constructed by some choice of @xmath49 orbitals as stated above .",
    "the calculation thus reduces to applying the algorithm of ref .",
    ". numerical calculation becomes too time consuming if the number of terms in the sum ( [ final ] ) is too large .",
    "nevertheless , it can be performed efficiently for mesoscopic systems .    from the rspdm",
    ", one can extract observables such as the momentum distribution , and important quantities like the natural orbitals ( nos ) and their occupancies .",
    "for example , the fermionic momentum distribution is given by @xmath51 the eigenfunctions of the fermionic rspdm , @xmath52 , are called the natural orbitals ( nos ) , @xmath53 the eigenvalues @xmath54 are the occupancies of these orbitals .",
    "the bosonic momentum distribution @xmath55 , nos @xmath56 , and occupancies @xmath57 , are defined by using equivalent relations for the bosonic rspdm .",
    "in this section we apply the presented formalism to study the rspdm , momentum distribution , natural orbitals and their occupancies for a bose - fermi mixture in a double well potential of the form @xmath58 where the parameter @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) denotes the width ( height , respectively ) of the gaussian barrier which splits the harmonic potential .",
    "we note in passing that the presented result may depend on the shape of the double - well potential ( e.g. , for the split - box potential ) as will be discussed below . here",
    "we work in dimensionless units ; the connection to physical units can be made straightforwardly : for example , if @xmath61 is the mass of bosons ( which is equal to the mass of fermions ) , and @xmath62 the unit of space ( which can be chosen at will ) , then the unit of energy is @xmath63 .    in what follows we present result of numerical simulations for the double - well parameters",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 ; the harmonic trap frequency parameter is @xmath66 .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have focused our attention to the cases when the splitting potential is sufficiently high , say , when @xmath60 is at least several times larger than the energy of the @xmath10th single - particle state of the potential @xmath67 .",
    "thus , all our conclusions should be understood to hold in this limit .",
    "the momentum distribution of the bosonic component was shown to be equivalent to that of @xmath10 tg bosons placed within @xmath2 and this case has already been addressed in ref .",
    "thus , we first turn our attention to the behavior of the fermionic momentum distribution in the mixture @xmath68 , in dependence of the number of particles .",
    "figure [ md - nf6nb0 - 4 ] shows @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while fig .",
    "[ md - nf7nb0 - 3 ] shows the same quantity for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from these figures we observe a qualitative difference in behavior of the fermionic momentum distribution in dependence on the parity of the total number of particles",
    "@xmath73 : if @xmath10 is even , then @xmath68 has a smooth bell - shaped profile .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath10 is odd , then there are nonnegligible modulations on top of the bell - shaped profile of @xmath68 ; in our simulations , for the parameters presented here , we find that the number of peaks in @xmath68 for odd @xmath10 is the same as the number of fermions in the mixture @xmath1 plus two additional humps on the side bands of the distribution .",
    "this parity dependent behavior is reflected onto the behavior of the total momentum distributions [ @xmath74 which are displayed in figures [ mdtotnf6 ] and [ mdtotnf7 ] for the same combinations of particles as presented in figs .",
    "[ md - nf6nb0 - 4 ] and [ md - nf7nb0 - 3 ] .",
    "interestingly , odd - odd combinations yield results very similar to the even - even ones , whereas even - odd combination yields results similar to the odd - even combinations .",
    "thus , the parity of the _ total _ number of particles determines the behavior of the fermionic component , at least for the mesoscopic numbers of particles studied here .",
    "the behavior of the fermionic momentum distribution results from the properties of the fermionic density matrix @xmath43 which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rspdm61 ] for @xmath69 and @xmath75 , fig .",
    "[ rspdm62 ] for @xmath69 and @xmath76 , fig .",
    "[ rspdm71 ] for @xmath71 and @xmath75 , and in fig .",
    "[ rspdm72 ] for @xmath71 and @xmath76 . from these figures",
    "we observe that the most significant difference between the total even and odd numbers of particles occurs in the second and the fourth quadrant of the @xmath77-@xmath78 plane : if @xmath10 is even , the values of the fermionic rspdm for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are negligible , @xmath81 ; in contrast to that , if @xmath10 is odd , there are some oscillations of rspdm in the second and the fourth quadrant , in particular close to the line @xmath82 .",
    "these observations indicate that there is much greater spatial coherence between the fields at the two sides of the well for odd @xmath10 .",
    "a similar observation has been made for the tg gas in a split trap @xcite .",
    "let us now focus on the natural orbitals , that is , their occupancies .",
    "the occupancies @xmath54 corresponding to the four fermionic density matrices from figs .",
    "[ rspdm61]-[rspdm72 ] are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ lambdas612 ] and [ lambdas712 ] .",
    "we immediately observe that when the total number of particles is even , the occupancies come in pairs and they correspond to the degenerate natural orbitals .",
    "namely for the total even numbers of particles the symmetry of the system with respect to the double well is naturally preserved .",
    "however , for the total odd number of particles this is not the case , which is reflected in the occupancies which do not come in degenerate pairs but rather decrease one by one .",
    "the observation on the off diagonal behavior of the fermionic rspdm can be underpinned analytically . to this end , let us assume that the trap is split by an infinitely strong delta function , i.e. , the the mixture is in the potential @xmath83 , where @xmath84 ; the potential @xmath85 can be a harmonic oscillator trap , or it may have some other functional form .",
    "for the strongly - interacting bose - fermi mixture in a ground state of such a potential we can prove the following : if the total number of particles @xmath10 is even , then @xmath86 in the second and the fourth quadrant of the @xmath77-@xmath78 plane , that is , for @xmath79 and @xmath87 .",
    "consecutive single - particle states in a split - trap potential are degenerate , i.e. , @xmath88 for @xmath89 ; moreover , degenerate eigenstates are simply related : @xmath90 . by using this relation , one of the two slater determinants ( [ slater ] ) which enter the formula for the rspdm ( [ fermirspdm ] ) [ the determinant which depends on variable @xmath77 ] can be written as    @xmath92    here we have simplified the notation and labeled the coordinates as @xmath93 , where @xmath40 runs up to the total number of particles @xmath10 , that is , we do not explicitly refer to the fermionic or bosonic coordinates , as it is redundant for the proof .",
    "let us assume that @xmath79 , and that @xmath94 coordinates are negative , @xmath95 are positive , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "first , let us demonstrate that the determinant ( [ det1 ] ) is zero in this case .",
    "in order to see that , we assume that @xmath98 , and that the rest of the coordinates are positive ( due to the antisymmetry of the slater determinant , any other choice of positive and negative coordinates would yield the same result ) .",
    "let us add the first column to the second one in ( [ det1 ] ) , then the third to the fourth column and so on to obtain    @xmath99    thus , the first @xmath94 entries of every even column , @xmath100 , is zero .",
    "suppose that we shift all these even columns all the way to the rigth ; the determinant is then proportional to    @xmath101    in the upper right corner there is a block of zeros with the size @xmath102 . since @xmath103 , the determinant is identically zero .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to verify by using the procedure outlined above that the determinant is exactly zero whenever @xmath104 , as long as @xmath77 and @xmath78 have opposite signs and @xmath10 is even . on the other hand , if @xmath105 , then the other slater determinant entering the formula for the rspdm in eq .",
    "( [ fermirspdm ] ) [ the one which depends on @xmath78 variable ] , does not have equal number of positive and negative coordinates and therefore it is zero , which completes our proof .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the same result holds for the bosonic part of the mixture , and therefore for the mixture as a whole .",
    "this result can be interpreted as follows : if two slits were opened on the opposite sides of the barrier , and if the gas was allowed to drop from the slits , expand , and interfere , the interference fringes would have not been observed for even @xmath10 and sufficiently high barrier .",
    "in fact , such an experiment could be used to determine the parity of the mixture .",
    "we note that this results corresponds to the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite on the difference in spatial coherence of the tonks - girardeau gas in a split - trap in dependence of the parity of the number of tg bosons .",
    "our proof covers this case as well .    finally , it is worthy to note that the shape of the external potential can influence the presented results .",
    "for example , for a box potential with a gaussian as a split - barrier we did not find the differences between the even and odd numbers of particles presented above , that is , in all cases the momentum distribution was smooth . for a potential of the form",
    "@xmath106 with a splitting gaussian term the differences between the odd and even numbers are recovered .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a 1d bose - fermi mixture , where the boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions are very strong and repulsive , whereas ( spin - polarized ) fermions are mutually noninteracting ; the atoms in each species have approximately the same mass .",
    "the ground state for this system for finite but very strong interactions in an external potential has been constructed in ref .",
    "we have studied the ground state properties of the mixture in a double - well trap , with a sufficiently high barrier .",
    "more specifically , a formula for the calculation of the reduced one - body density matrix of the fermionic ( and also bosonic ) component has been derived , which was subsequently employed to study the momentum distribution , natural orbitals and their occupancies .",
    "we have found that the behavior of the momentum distribution depends on the parity of the total number of particles : for even mixtures the momentum distribution is smooth , whereas the momentum distribution of odd mixtures possesses distinct modulations .",
    "when the total number of particles is even , the correlations expressed by the reduced one - body density matrix are negligible between the two wells .",
