    "recall that , for the unilateral solution under alternate pacing , @xmath84 occurs for @xmath75 odd due to the sign convention ( [ eqn : sign ] ) , and this behavior continues for the bilateral solution computed in section 3.2 ; i.e. this bilateral solution is in phase with the unilateral solution .",
    "thus , we refer to such bilateral solution as an _ in - phase _ bilateral solution . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath8 is sufficiently large negative , there exists a bilateral solution with the opposite phase ; i.e. , @xmath84 occurs for @xmath75 even .",
    "we refer to the latter as an _ out - of - phase _ bilateral solution .    continuing the notation as in ( [ eqn : bilateral ] ) , the out - of - phase bilateral solution is characterized by the following equations@xmath198 note the signs of the terms @xmath199 are different in the above equations and ( [ eqn : bilateral_eqn ] ) . solving the above equations yields@xmath200 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 have been computed in equation ( [ eqn : x_u&l ] ) , and the @xmath8-independent shifts @xmath99 , @xmath100 have been computed in equation ( [ eqn : s_u&l ] ) .",
    "note that the out - of - phase and in - phase bilateral solutions are parallel to each other because they are both parallel to the solution @xmath201 , @xmath55 .",
    "one can show that the out - of - phase bilateral solution exists only when @xmath202 . as required in condition 6 , @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 has to be sufficiently large negative for the out - of - phase bilateral solution to exist .",

    "<S> unlike classical bifurcations , border - collision bifurcations occur when , for example , a fixed point of a continuous , piecewise @xmath0 map crosses a boundary in state space . </S>",

    "<S> this paper considers a particular class of border - collision bifurcations , i.e. , border - collision period - doubling bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a subharmonic perturbation to the bifurcation parameter , which is also known as alternate pacing , and we investigate the response under such pacing near the original bifurcation point . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting behavior is characterized quantitatively by a gain , which is the ratio of the response amplitude to the applied perturbation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the gain in a border - collision period - doubling bifurcation has a qualitatively different dependence on parameters from that of a classical period - doubling bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps surprisingly , the differences are more readily apparent if the gain is plotted vs. the perturbation amplitude ( with the bifurcation parameter fixed ) than if plotted vs. the bifurcation parameter ( with the perturbation amplitude fixed ) . when this observation is exploited , the gain under alternate pacing provides a useful experimental tool to identify a border - collision period - doubling bifurcation . </S>"
