    "he ever - increasing loading of transmission networks together with a steady increase in load demands has pushed many power systems ever closer to their stability limit @xcite-@xcite .",
    "long - term stability has become more and more important for secure operation of power systems .",
    "however , the long - term stability model is large and involves different time scales .",
    "the time domain simulation approach for the long - term stability model is expensive in terms of computational efforts and data processing .",
    "these constraints are even more stringent in the context of on - line stability assessment .",
    "the quasi steady - state ( qss ) proposed in @xcite-@xcite tried to reach a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency for long - term stability analysis .",
    "the assumptions behind the qss model that the post - fault transient stability model is stable and the long - term stability model is singularity - free are not necessarily true .",
    "there have been some efforts attending to address these issues @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to another critical issue that even these assumptions are satisfied , the qss model may still provide incorrect approximations for the long - term stability model .",
    "some counter examples in which the qss model were stable while the long - term stability model underwent long - term instabilities were presented in @xcite . since the qss model can not consistently provide correct stability analysis of the long - term stability model , there is a great need to identify conditions under which the qss model works . in this paper ,",
    "sufficient conditions under which the qss model can provide correct approximations for the long - term stability model are developed .",
    "briefly speaking , if neither the long - term stability model nor the qss model meets a singularity , then the qss model provides correct approximations for the long - term stability model in terms of trajectory if the qss model moves along the stable component of its constraint manifold and the projection of each point on the trajectory of the long - term stability model lies inside the stability region of the corresponding transient stability model .",
    "moreover , if the qss model converges to a long - term stable equilibrium point ( sep ) , then the long - term stability model will converge to the same point .",
    "several numerical examples in which the qss model succeeded or failed are analyzed by the derived analytical results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectioncompleteqssmodel ] recalls basic concepts of power system models , and section [ mathprelim ] introduces mathematical preliminaries in nonlinear system theories",
    ". then sufficient conditions of the qss model are derived in section [ analyticalstudies ] , and several numerical examples are analyzed based on the derived theorems in section [ numericalstudies ] .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are stated in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the long - term stability model , or interchangeably complete dynamic model , for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance can be described as : @xmath1    equation ( [ algebraic eqn ] ) describes the electrical transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices , and ( [ fast ode ] ) describes the internal dynamics of devices such as generators , their associated control systems , certain loads , and other dynamically modeled components . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are continuous functions , and vector @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding short - term state variables and algebraic variables . besides , equations ( [ slow ode ] ) and ( [ slow dde ] ) describe long - term dynamics including exponential recovery load , turbine governor , load tap changer ( ltc ) , over excitation limiter ( oxl ) , etc . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the continuous and discrete long - term state variables respectively , and @xmath8 is the maximum time constant among devices . since transient dynamics have much smaller time constants compared with those of long - term dynamics , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also termed as slow state variables , and @xmath11 are termed as fast state variables .",
    "detailed power system models and corresponding variables are given in appendix .",
    "the transient stability model and the qss model are regarded as two approximations of the long - term stability model in short - term and long - term time scales respectively , and they are believed to offer a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency . in transient stability model ,",
    "slow variables are considered as constants . while in the qss model , the dynamic behavior of fast variables are considered as instantaneously fast and thus replaced by its equilibrium equations in the long - term time scale . if we represent the long - term stability model and the qss model in @xmath12 time scale , where @xmath13 , and we denote @xmath14 as @xmath15 , then power system models can be represented as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
