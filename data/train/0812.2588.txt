    "the problem of determining explicit conditions over the coefficients of the two ellipses to ensure that the poncelet s map is conjugated to a rational rotation was solved by cayley .",
    "an excellent exposition of this result is given in  @xcite .",
    "a monograph devoted to poncelet s theorem and related results it is going to appear soon , see @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in poncelet s theorem it is not restrictive to assume that @xmath37 the first question that we face in this paper is the following : is the poncelet s result also true when we consider @xmath38 and @xmath4 given by an oval of an algebraic curve of higher degree ? we prove :    [ mt ] fix @xmath37 then for any @xmath39 @xmath40 there is an algebraic curve of degree @xmath41 containing a convex oval @xmath42 such that the poncelet s map associated to @xmath43 and @xmath44 has rational rotation number and it is not conjugated to a rotation .",

    "moreover the full dynamics of the introduced poncelet s maps @xmath45 will be described in that section .    from theorem [ mt ]",
    "it is clear that , in general , poncelet s maps with rational rotation numbers are not conjugated to rotations .",
    "it is natural to wonder about this question when both ovals are level sets of the same polynomial map @xmath46 as one of the simplest cases we consider the homogeneous map @xmath47 , giving @xmath48 for @xmath49 as we will see in section [ sec3 ] even in this situation the conjugacy with a rotation is not true .    the poncelet s maps also provide a natural way of defining an integrable function from an open set of @xmath50 into itself as follows : we foliate the open unbounded connected component @xmath51 of @xmath52 as @xmath53 then the poncelet s construction gives a new diffeomorphism , also of class @xmath5 that is defined from @xmath54 into itself , which simply consists in applying to each point @xmath55 the corresponding poncelet s map , associated to the level set of @xmath56 passing trough @xmath57 for sake of simplicity we also call it  @xmath58 notice that this map is trivially integrable by means of @xmath59 that is @xmath60 for all @xmath61    as we will see in subsection [ ode ] , this extended poncelet s map @xmath0 will be useful to give properties of a functional equation that helps to study integrable planar maps .",
    "finally , in the above context it is natural to introduce the rotation function @xmath62 as the rotation number of @xmath0 associated to @xmath3 and @xmath63 and to study some of its properties .    in the case of two concentric circles",
    "@xmath64 it is easy to prove that the rotation function @xmath65 is the smooth monotonous function @xmath66 on the other hand , in section [ sec3 ] we will show that the function @xmath62 is much more complicated .",
    "indeed all what we prove seems to indicate that it has the usual shape of the rotation function of generic one - parameter families of diffeomorphisms : the devil s staircase , see for instance @xcite .",

    "it is easy to prove that , for instance when @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the statement of proposition [ prop3 ] , i.e. when @xmath132 the poncelet s map @xmath0 is such that @xmath108 it has the two 4-periodic orbits @xmath71 , and @xmath133 where @xmath134 and it is not conjugated to a rotation .",
    "this section is devoted to study in more detail the poncelet s maps associated to the ovals @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath137      let us impose which condition has to satisfy an orbit to be @xmath35 periodic for a poncelet s map associated to the two ovals @xmath138 and @xmath139 take @xmath35 counterclockwise ordered points on @xmath140 @xmath141 draw the @xmath35 tangent lines to @xmath140 corresponding to these points , and denote them by @xmath142 respectively . to generate a @xmath35-periodic orbit of @xmath0 the following assertions must hold :    * the lines @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 where @xmath146 intersect .",

    "on the other hand when we consider the same problem between @xmath138 and @xmath149 and we take @xmath150 also as a free unknown , the problem of searching @xmath35-periodic orbits is equivalent to impose instead of item ( ii ) , the following @xmath151 equalities : @xmath152    so in this case we get again a non - linear system with @xmath35 unknowns but now with only @xmath151 equations .",
    "hence , it is natural to believe that either it has no solution or it has a continuum of them .",

    "these are given by the two axes and the diagonals @xmath162 in this section we search some periodic orbits of the poncelet s maps @xmath163 associated to @xmath164 and @xmath165 that share some of these symmetries .",
    "for these type of periodic orbits the order of the system described in the previous subsection , that has to be solved to find the periodic orbits , can be reduced .    as an example we find a value @xmath150 for which the corresponding poncelet s map has rotation number @xmath166 due to the existence of a symmetric 3-periodic orbit with respect to the @xmath167axis .",

    "we have that @xmath171 to give rise to a 3-periodic orbit with the searched symmetry , the third point has to be @xmath172 moreover we get that @xmath173 hence the conditions that imply that the three intersection points between the tangent lines belong to the same @xmath165 reduce to the single equation @xmath174 or equivalently to impose that @xmath175 satisfies the equation @xmath176 where we have used that @xmath177 some calculations give that @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a polynomial of degree 15 which has only one real root , @xmath180 the value of @xmath150 corresponding to this solution is @xmath181 this result is reflected in table  1 .",

    "all these results , together with the fact that @xmath195 which simply follows from the geometrical interpretation of @xmath163 are collected in table 1 .    .some values of @xmath150 with rational rotation number and symmetric period orbits . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ nota ] notice that , once we have a @xmath35-periodic orbit for a given poncelet s map , then the six sets obtained by applying to it either a rotation of @xmath196 or @xmath197 radians or one of the symmetries with respect to the diagonals @xmath198 are also @xmath35-periodic orbits . moreover ,",
    "unless the original periodic orbit has some of the symmetries considered in this subsection , these six @xmath35-periodic orbits are all different .    as a corollary of the above remark we get , for instance , that for @xmath199 the poncelet map has four 3-periodic orbits .",
    "similarly , for @xmath200 the corresponding poncelet s map has four different periodic orbits , as well .",

    "the existence of open intervals on which the rotation function @xmath156 for poncelet s maps @xmath0 associated to @xmath209 and @xmath210 is constant can be interpreted by using the above facts . here",
    "we discuss how the existence of this type of intervals can also be interpreted more geometrically .",
    "consider for instance the two values of @xmath150 for which @xmath211 obtained in subsection  [ spo ] , @xmath212 and @xmath213 by using the method described in subsection  [ po ] we have done a numerical study about the existence of other values of @xmath150 having as well a 3-periodic orbit .",
    "we have obtained that for any @xmath214 $ ] such an orbit exists , see for instance the middle picture in figure  3 .",
    "moreover for any @xmath215 the orbit that we have found has none of the symmetries described in this section . by using remark  [ nota ] , we know that for each of these values of @xmath150 , the poncelet s map has six different periodic orbits . on the other hand",
    "the boundaries of the interval correspond with values of @xmath150 for which some of these six 3-periodic orbits collide giving rise to some symmetric 3-period orbit , which indeed has to be a multiple @xmath216-periodic orbit and so no hyperbolic for  @xmath58    we have also checked that a similar phenomenon occurs when @xmath217.$ ] on this interval @xmath218    an open problem is to prove if the situation described for @xmath166 and @xmath193 holds for any rational number in @xmath219 and also study the same question for other families of convex ovals .      in @xcite",
    "it is proved the following result :    [ teor ] let @xmath220 be an open set and let @xmath221 be a diffeomorphism such that :    1 .",
