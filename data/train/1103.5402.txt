    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this dust emission has a broad peak of the modified blackbody in far - infrared bands from large grains in thermal equilibrium with temperatures of @xmath8 1050 k. the sed in near- to mid - infrared bands is , on the other hand , characterized by emissions from small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) that have a wide distribution of temperature because of stochastic single - photon heating ( desert et al .",

    "heavily obscured star formation activity is difficult to detect by observations in ultraviolet / optical observations , and infrared / submillimeter observations should crucially be important to get the full picture of the formation and evolution of galaxies . in the last decade , our observational knowledge about the hidden side of galaxy evolution has significantly improved thanks to the advanced infrared / submillimeter facilities such as jcmt / scuba , spitzer , akari , and herschel . moreover , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will revolutionize our understanding of galaxy evolution in the near future . in order to extract useful information from these data ,",
    "we need good theoretical understanding and models of galactic dust emission to be compared .    however , it is not straightforward to predict global ( i.e. , galactic - scale ) seds of dust emission for a theoretical model galaxy , in contrast to direct stellar emission that can be calculated by the method of stellar population synthesis .",
    "this is because the physics determining the global sed of dust emission and its relations to other physical properties have remained highly elusive ( see walcher et al .",

    "an approach often taken in the literature ( e.g. , guiderdoni et al .",

    "however , there is a large scatter along the mean @xmath0-@xmath10 relation ( see , e.g. , hwang et al .",
    "2010 for recent data ) , and it is physically unreasonable to relate an extensive quantity @xmath0 that scales with the system size to an intensive quantity @xmath10 that does not ( totani & takeuchi 2002 ) .",

    "the assumption of constant @xmath46 is theoretically reasonable if the dust production process works similarly in all galaxies .",
    "it is also known that the dust - to - gas ratio estimated by extinction in optical bands for nearby galaxies and quasar absorption line systems ( qalss ) is correlated well with metallicity , indicating that @xmath74 is roughly constant ( issa et al .",
    "1990 ; boissier et al . 2004",

    "it should be noted that the extinction in qalss is sensitive to all dust grains in a system on the line of sight , in contrast to @xmath33 that traces only dust heated by radiation .",

    "these two independently measured quantities are correlated much better , as shown in the histogram of @xmath85 in fig .",

    "the majority of galaxies are clustering around @xmath87 within a factor of 2 , and the ratio of 0.015 is close to the expectation of typical dust - to - hydrogen ratio @xmath88 .",
    "it is known that molecular hydrogen is the dominant form of hydrogen when the gas column density is very high like circumnuclear starbursts ( kennicutt 1998 ; bigiel et al .",
    "therefore , this result implies that the infrared - emitting dust mass is close to the total dust mass , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "we consider that this result can be interpreted as follows .",
    "as argued by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , @xmath0 can be regarded as a good sfr indicator for the k98 sb sample . using the relations of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath1 is equivalent to the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , @xmath92 , which is defined as sfr per unit hydrogen gas mass .",
    "( [ eq : sfr_l_tir ] ) and ( [ eq : l_tir_m_dir_u_h ] ) , we find @xmath93 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the upper limit of @xmath80 is translated into the upper limit of @xmath94 .",
    "then , the systematic change of the @xmath5-@xmath1 relation can be explained if there is a fundamental upper limit on sfe by the physics of star formation ( see  [ section : ks ] for more discussion on the origin of this upper limit ) .",
    "if this upper limit exists , the distribution case b2 is not allowed when @xmath95 . for the case b2 ,",
    "star formation must occur within a thin layer of the disk whose dust column density is @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 , adopting a typical dust - to - hydrogen ratio ) .",
    "then there is a maximum of the surface sfr density [ @xmath98 for the case b2 determined by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath102 is higher than this , the gas column density of the star forming layer must proportionally increase beyond @xmath103 because of the limit of @xmath99 , and hence @xmath104 while @xmath1 becomes constant at @xmath105 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the case b1 rather than b2 , and the transition from b2 occurs around @xmath101 .",
    "this result should have some implications for the well - known kennicutt - schmidt law on the plane of @xmath106-@xmath102 .",
    "we will discuss about this issue in more detail in  [ section : ks ] .",
    "we have found that galaxies studied here are well described by the distribution case b1 or b2 , meaning that they are optically thick to dust - heating radiation on a galactic scale ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of the infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l_opt_l_tir ] ) ; the distribution extends down to @xmath108 with a sudden drop of the galaxy number at @xmath109 , indicating a paucity of optically thin galaxies ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this is also indicated by the sequence of @xmath75 in fig . [",
    "fig : sig_z_dzr ] .",
    "if there are a significant number of optically thin galaxies , such galaxies should appear in the region of @xmath111 with a constant value of @xmath112 , corresponding to @xmath113 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , such galaxies are not found , and the sequence seems to stop at @xmath96 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "if the optical thickness to dust - heating radiation does not have any effect on galaxy formation efficiency , a fine - tuning would be required for the sharp drop of galaxy distribution around @xmath69 .",
    "a possible explanation is a selection effect ; optically thin galaxies would have small infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio and hence could be missed in the samples selected by infrared emission . to check this possibility , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_s_int ] velocity - integrated 21-cm flux density ( @xmath114 ) versus angular size ( @xmath115 ) for the sdss - h and hipass samples , in comparison with the akari - sdss and akari - hipass galaxies .",
    "the lines corresponding to several values of h column density @xmath116 are also depicted .",
    "it can be seen that there is no significant difference between the distributions of @xmath117 for the akari - detected and -nondetected galaxies , and the paucity of galaxies in the region of @xmath118 can be seen , roughly corresponding to @xmath110 for typical values of @xmath39 , @xmath46 , and @xmath37 .",
    "hence the infrared selection bias can not explain the paucity of optically thin galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the beam size of hipass is 15.5 arcmin , which is much larger than the galaxy sizes , and hence there should be no selection bias about surface brightness in the h data .",
    "therefore we consider that there is a physical effect reducing the efficiency of galaxy formation when @xmath110 . because the opacity is to dust - heating radiation , it is most likely the radiative feedback by the dust photoelectric heating of ism . a part ( typically @xmath119 110% ) of radiation energy absorbed by dust grains",
    "is converted to photoelectrons and subsequently heat ism , and this effect is large enough to be the dominant heating process in many phases of ism in galaxies ( see , e.g. , bakes & tielens 1994 ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ; rubin et al .",
    "then , in @xmath110 galaxies , it is expected that the lack of self - shielding of dust - heating radiation leads to the suppression of star formation activity and reduction of neutral gas in ism on a galactic scale .",

    "[ fig : theta_s_int ] shows the paucity of galaxies at the region of @xmath120 .",
    "this is likely because most of gas tends to be molecular when gas column density is high , resulting in a saturation of @xmath117 , as observed for nearby galaxies ( bigiel et al .",
    "the efficient self - shielding of dust - heating radiation may be responsible for converting h into h@xmath83 .",
    "the lack of both large and small @xmath117 galaxies by these effects may explain the known good correlation between h mass and size , @xmath121 ( haynes & giovanelli 1984 ; rosenberg & schneider 2003 ; garcia - appadoo et al .",

    "these quantities are closely related to the surface density of sfr , @xmath124 , and surface hydrogen gas density , @xmath106 . since the correlation between @xmath102 and @xmath106 is frequently discussed in the literature as the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1998 ) , it is interesting to discuss about it in light of the results obtained in this work .    in figure",

    "this range of @xmath106 roughly corresponds to @xmath110 , and as argued in ",
    "[ section : feedback ] , the radiative feedback process seems to be working to suppress the star formation activity . then the relation between sfr and h gas amount would become complicated by unstable competition between star formation and its feedback .",
    "this may give an explanation for the large dispersion in the @xmath102-@xmath117 relation .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have found in  [ section : sb ] that @xmath1 is constant at @xmath128 for the akari - sb sample , corresponding to a constant sfe of @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath129 .",

    "it is interesting to note that this characteristic sfe is in nice agreement with those found in the correlation between @xmath84 and sfr for a wide variety of galaxies as well as molecular clouds in the galaxy ( gao & solomon 2004 ; wu et al .",
    "2005 ; bigiel et al .",
    "2008 ; evans et al . 2009 ) , when the gas mass is measured from tracers of dense molecular gas .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath99 is a universal characteristic value originating from the physics of star formation in ism , rather than time scales on a galactic scale .",
    "it is widely known that the efficiency of star formation from molecular clouds is typically a few percent in mass fraction , and typical dynamical time scales of molecular clouds are myr , resulting in a star formation time scale of @xmath131 0.1 gyr .",
    "this maximum sfe @xmath99 seems to be achieved on a galactic scale when @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) because the self - shielding effect of dust - heating radiation is working for efficient gas cooling .",
    "most of interstellar gas would be molecular in such galaxies .",
    "now we may interpret the overall trend of the galaxy distribution on the @xmath124-@xmath106 plane by the strong dependence of sfe on the dust opacity , as follows .",
    "there are very few galaxies having @xmath134 , because the feedback suppresses an efficient star formation .",
    "galaxies appear in the region of @xmath107 with a large dispersion in the kennicutt - schmidt law , because sfe rapidly increases around @xmath69 . then sfe continues to increase and asymptotically reaches the maximum value of @xmath135 at @xmath132 .",
    "we expect many galaxies around @xmath69 because star formation time scale is relatively longer than that in more dusty galaxies .",
    "there are a few implications of the results obtained by this work for theoretical modeling of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "first of all , the tight correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 for normal galaxies provides a convenient way to calculate infrared seds in cosmological galaxy formation models , in which the total dust - unabsorbed luminosity of stellar emission and size of a galaxy can be calculated in a relatively straightforward manner .",
    "when galaxies are optically thick in terms of @xmath123 as indicated by our study , the total stellar luminosity gives a direct estimate of @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath1 or @xmath10 can easily be calculated from the @xmath5-@xmath1 relation , which is more reliable than @xmath126-@xmath10 relation because of the tighter correlation and more solid physical background .",
    "there is no particular reason to expect that this relation does not hold for high redshift galaxies , if the dust properties are not significantly different and the spatial distribution of stars and dust grains is the case b2 .",
    "it must be examined whether the existing _ ab initio _ galaxy formation models of infrared emission satisfy this relation , especially at @xmath136 .",
    "another important implication is the strong dependence of star forming activity on dust opacity or gas column density suggested in ",
    "[ section : feedback ] and  [ section : ks ] .",
    "various feedback processes have intensively been discussed in the context of cosmological galaxy formation ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2003 ; baugh 2006 ; silk 2011 ) , but these feedback processes are not physically connected to the galaxy - scale dust opacity , @xmath123 .",
    "photoionization of hydrogens may have a similar dependence on gas column density , but it has a much larger opacity than @xmath123 by a factor of @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "supernova / agn feedbacks are unlikely related to the galaxy - scale dust opacity .",
    "we have argued in ",
    "[ section : feedback ] that the dust photoelectric heating of ism is the likely process responsible for the feedback working in @xmath110 galaxies .",
    "( [ eq : sfr_l_tir ] ) , 1 @xmath139 of star formation produces @xmath140 erg by photoelectric heating , when most of heating radiation energy is absorbed into dust grains .",
    "this heating energy is comparable with and may even be larger than @xmath141 erg produced by the supernova feedback ( assuming @xmath142 erg per one supernova , 8 @xmath139 threshold for supernova explosions , and the kroupa imf ) .",
    "in contrast to supernova feedback , which is a local energy input only to dynamically connected regions , photoelectric heating could suppress star formation on the global scale in a galaxy when @xmath110 .",
    "such a feedback effect as a function of dust opacity ( or gas column density ) may systematically change the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "cosmological objects with dark matter mass @xmath143 virializing at redshift @xmath144 have virial density proportional to @xmath145 , and the available baryon mass and galaxy size roughly scale with dark matter mass and virial radius , respectively .",
    "therefore we expect that gas column density scales as @xmath146 , indicating that this effect will accelerate star formation at higher redshifts , also weakly favoring star formation in massive objects at a fixed redshift .",
    "this may have interesting implications for some major problems in the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario ( e.g. , baugh 2006 ; silk 2011 ) .",
    "one is the difficulty to reproduce the early appearance of massive and quiescent galaxies at high redshifts ( cimatti et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ) , and another is that the theory predicts too large stellar mass in massive dark halos ( @xmath147 ) at @xmath148 compared with the observed galaxy luminosity function ( the so - called `` overcooling '' problem ) . if sfe is a strong function of @xmath123 , it would increase the star formation activity at high - redshift compact dark halos .",
    "massive objects have larger gas column density at a fixed redshift , which may be relevant to reproduce the well - known trend of downsizing in galaxy formation .",
    "on the other hand , dark halos collapsing at low redshifts are massive but have low densities , and star formation would be suppressed to alleviate the overcooling problem .",
    "one of the most important results of this paper is the tight correlation between the dust - heating radiation strength @xmath1 and the galaxy - scale infrared radiation strength @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is equivalent to the infrared surface brightness , and the correlation of this quantity to infrared sed has been studied by lehnert & heckman ( 1996 , hereafter lh96 ) and chanial et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter c07 ) .",
    "lh96 estimated the size of 32 nearby starburst galaxies by h@xmath149 images , and found a correlation between @xmath150 and infrared color temperature estimated by 60/100 @xmath13 m flux ratios .",
    "they argued that a surrounding dust screen radiated by a radiation field strength of @xmath150 is an adequate zeroth - order description of their data , which is equivalent to our interpretation of the case b2 for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , we also found that @xmath1 becomes roughly constant for circumnuclear starbursts in the high sfr density region .",
    "the lh96 galaxies are in the range of @xmath151 , roughly corresponding to @xmath152 assuming that the h@xmath149 radius is not different from the @xmath153-band radius used here .",
    "this is the region of transition from @xmath154 to a constant @xmath1 , and indeed , the distribution of the lh96 galaxies is flatter than expected from the simple surrounding screen in the @xmath155 versus @xmath156 plane ( see their fig .",
    "our result is thus not inconsistent with that of lh96 , but revealed the correlation more quantitatively by larger statistics , using not only starbursts but also normal galaxies .",
    "c07 studied on samples ( @xmath131400 galaxies in total ) including non - starburst galaxies .",
    "they estimated galaxy sizes by radio continuum ( rc ) images , and found a correlation of @xmath157 with @xmath158 , where @xmath10 is the dust temperature estimated by assuming the modified blackbody spectrum .",
    "the range of @xmath159 is @xmath160@xmath161 ( @xmath162@xmath163 ) .",
    "in contrast to lh96 , they concluded that the surrounding dust screen is ruled out because the observed slope of the correlation is significantly different from the expectation ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "instead , they proposed another interpretation based on the kennicutt - schmidt law . assuming a constant dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath165 ) , @xmath166 , and the original form of the kennicutt - schmidt law ( @xmath167 , kennicutt 1998 ) , the basic equation of @xmath168 can be reduced to @xmath169 , which is close to the observed @xmath170 value with the emissivity index of @xmath1712 .",
    "our result of @xmath172 for normal galaxies ( @xmath173 ) is equivalent to @xmath164 , while the constant @xmath1 for the circumnuclear starbursts ( @xmath174 ) corresponds to @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath170 value obtained by c07 may be a result of the fit including the transition region of @xmath5 between the two regimes .",
    "their interpretation based on the kennicutt - schmidt law is not supported from our study , because we have seen that sfr is not proportional to @xmath0 , and @xmath64 is roughly constant against change of @xmath176 , for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "there is a large scatter in the kennicutt - schmidt law , and it is unlikely that the tight correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 emerges from this law .    besides the larger statistics , the strength of our study is that we estimated the dust - heating radiation field strength by fitting realistic physical dust models to the four akari / fis photometric bands at 65160 @xmath13 m covering the broad thermal sed peak .",
    "it is good to use @xmath1 instead of @xmath10 to examine the correlation against @xmath79 , because they have the same physical dimensions and hence not only the scaling between the two but also the ratio @xmath4 is physically meaningful .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath10 is meaningful only for large grains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "another important source of difference is that , as mentioned in ",
    "[ section : l_tir_u_h ] , the akari - based samples include galaxies with smaller @xmath1 than the iras - based samples used in the previous studies , which enabled us to clearly find the linear correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 in the normal galaxy regime .",
    "we have constructed two new low - redshift galaxy samples based on the akari / fis all sky bright source catalog : the akari - sdss sample ( 878 galaxies ) cross - correlated with the sdss galaxies and available h data , and the akari - hipass sample ( 711 galaxies ) cross - correlated with the hipass h galaxy catalog . to complement these for wider dynamic range of surface sfr density , the akari - sb sample ( 24 galaxies )",
    "has also been constructed from nearby circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "these samples include only galaxies having high quality akari / fis fluxes at least in two bands to ensure the reliability of sed fittings .",
    "we then studied these samples to understand the physics determining galactic - scale infrared seds , especially the broad thermal peak by large grains .",
    "the strength of dust - heating radiation field ( @xmath1 , roughly corresponding to the dust temperature as @xmath177 ) , heated dust mass ( @xmath33 ) , and total infrared luminosity ( @xmath0 ) were derived from the fittings of physical dust models to the observed infrared seds , and their correlations with various physical quantities [ optical size and luminosity , sfr ( @xmath178 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath179 ) , metallicity , and h or h@xmath83 gas masses ] were investigated .",
    "we found a tight power - law correlation between the @xmath180 ratio and the specific sfr ( ssfr , @xmath181 ) , as @xmath182 , which is valid except for very dusty galaxies having a large infrared - to - optical luminosity ratio (  [ section : l_tir_l_opt_sfr ] ) . therefore ssfr is a good measure of the contribution from young stars to @xmath0 .",
    "this relation may be useful to estimate the third parameter when two of sfr , @xmath179 , and @xmath0 are known .",
    "the widely used value of @xmath180 as a sfr indicator is valid only for galaxies having largest ssfr of @xmath183 , and relatively aged stellar population must be taken into account in the dust - heating energy budget for most of the akari - sdss galaxies .    the most important result of this work is the discovery of the tight linear correlation between @xmath1 and galactic - scale mean infrared radiation field @xmath184 for the akari - sdss and akari - hipass samples , taking the @xmath153-band optical size as @xmath3 (  [ section : u_tir_u_h ] ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath4 is close to unity in the same physical units , and the physical dispersion along this relation in @xmath1 is about 0.3 dex ( @xmath185% in the dust temperature ) .",
    "this @xmath5-@xmath1 relation is nicely explained by a thin disk of dust - heating sources embedded in a thicker , optically - thick ( @xmath107 ) dust disk ( the case b2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dust_dist_schem ] ) , where @xmath123 is the effective dust opacity averaged over wavelength with the weight of the sed of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "this also means that infrared seds of galaxies are determined mainly by isrf on a galactic scale , rather than those on smaller scales like individual star forming regions or molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath1 relation is particularly useful in theoretical modeling of infrared emission , giving a simple method to determine dust sed from @xmath0 and @xmath3 that can be predicted relatively easily in cosmological galaxy formation models",
    ". it may also be useful in observational studies ; e.g. , when flux of dust emission is available only in one band for a galaxy but its size is known , one can make a guess about the sed shape and @xmath0 by searching for @xmath1 that satisfies the relation of @xmath186 .    since",
    "only dust in the layer of one optical depth is heated , the dust column density estimated by infrared emission should be constant at @xmath187 corresponding to @xmath188 , which was also confirmed by our data .",
    "this interpretation predicts that the heated fraction of the total dust mass ( @xmath189 ) scales with the total dust column density as @xmath190 , and the observed trends of @xmath191 and @xmath192 support this expectation , where @xmath193 denotes the metal in h gas phase (  [ section : dust - vs - metal ] ) .",
    "an important implication is that , for many normal galaxies , the dust mass derived from infrared emission gives only a lower bound , with a significant amount of cold dust not contributing to infrared emission .    on the other hand ,",
    "the data of the akari - sb sample indicate that there is an upper limit of @xmath194 ( in units of the local isrf around the solar neighbourhood ) , and @xmath1 becomes constant at this value for intensive starbursts having @xmath195 (  [ section : sb ] ) . the h@xmath83 mass",
    "is tightly correlated with the heated dust mass @xmath33 , and the upper limit of @xmath1 corresponds to the maximum star formation efficiency ( sfe , defined as sfr per hydrogen gas mass ) of @xmath196 .",
    "this maximum sfe likely originates from the physics of star formation in ism , and the spatial distribution of heating sources and dust changes from the case b2 to b1 ( the same mixed distribution for stars and dust ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dust_dist_schem ] around @xmath197 .",
    "all the galaxies studied here seem optically thick to dust heating radiation .",
    "the distribution of @xmath123 extends down to @xmath198 , but there is a sharp drop of the number of optically thin galaxies at @xmath110",
    ". we argued in ",
    "[ section : feedback ] that this is unlikely to be a result of selection effects , but there seems a feedback effect to suppress the formation of optically thin galaxies . because it is related to dust opacity ,",
    "the feedback is likely by the photoelectric heating of ism by dust grains .",
    "this process is known to be the major heating in many phases of ism , and the self - shielding of dust - heating radiation on a galactic scale may be a necessary condition to avoid a global suppression of star formation .",
    "it is often stated that starburst galaxies are dusty , but if this hypothesis is true , one may rather state that they are starbursts _ because _ they are dusty .",
    "we discussed implications of our results for galaxy formation in general .",
    "the strong dependence of galactic - scale gas cooling on @xmath123 may be responsible for the known correlation between h mass and size ( @xmath199 ) , which is on the line corresponding to @xmath69 (  [ section : feedback ] ) .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt law ( sfr surface density @xmath124 versus hydrogen gas surface density @xmath106 ) may be understood by the maximum sfe @xmath99 as the baseline with the strong dependence of sfe on @xmath123 by the feedback (  [ section : ks ] ) .",
    "the feedback by dust opacity may also have interesting implications for galaxy formation in the cosmological context , because it would accelerate star formation in massive objects at high redshifts .",
    "such an effect may be helpful to solve some of the problems currently discussed in the field of cosmological galaxy formation (  [ section : cosmology ] ) .",
    "it is quite intriguing to examine whether the scaling relations found in this work , especially @xmath5-@xmath1 , hold also for high redshift galaxies .",
    "planned infrared / submillimeter facilities will give such opportunities in the near future .",
