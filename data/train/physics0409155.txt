    "classical electrodynamics is fundamentally linked to the concepts of relativity and spacetime symmetry . in particular ,",
    "many high precision tests of relativity are based on electromagnetic phenomena . at present",
    ", there is a growing interest ( both theoretically and experimentally ) in the search for possible _ violations of the lorentz symmetry_. the latter may naturally occur , for example , in the framework of unified theories of physical interactions at the planck length scale , and may then manifest themselves at the scales of usual high - energy particle physics in the form of corrections to the established quantum field - theoretical models .",
    "even though presently the limits of the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) become visible , see sec.10.6 of the new particle data report @xcite , it still remains the basis of our understanding of the strong and the electroweak interactions . at the foundations of the sm",
    "lays special relativity with the poincar symmetry group and , associated with it , the _ light cone _ structure . although this _ rigid _ light cone structure of special relativity is assumed as framework for the sm , we know from general relativity theory ( gr ) and from experiments that the light cone structure is in fact `` flexible '' . in other words , in gr",
    "the metric becomes a space and time dependent field .",
    "this alone demonstrates that the sm can not be strictly correct .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to take care of this state of affairs and to build up a more general framework for the sm and perhaps even to include gr .",
    "one of the promising approaches is the standard model extension ( sme ) of kosteleck and collaborators , see @xcite , in which by means of a set of parameters certain violations of the sm are put in a quantitative form amenable to experimental tests .",
    "the photon sector of the sme has been particularly closely studied in @xcite , where the propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum was investigated with lorentz violating terms added in the effective _ constitutive _ tensor .    in this paper",
    ", we continue the study of electrodynamical phenomena in the framework of the so - called premetric approach , i.e. , without assuming a special form of the metric structure on a spacetime manifold .",
    "such an approach provides a general technique for an appropriate physical discussion of the experimental tests of possible violations of the lorentz symmetry and of parity , since at the outset no assumptions were allowed about geometric structures , such as the metric or the connection of spacetime . on the contrary ,",
    "the analysis of the dynamics of the electromagnetic field in this approach yields , via the light propagation , the information about the underlying metrical structure of spacetime .",
    "accordingly , this scheme can be viewed as a general test theory of the searches for possible deviations from the lorentz symmetry in the photon sector of sme .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the multi - parameter approach of kosteleck and mewes @xcite can be naturally embedded into the framework of general premetric electrodynamics .",
    "electromagnetic wave propagation is a very important physical phenomenon in classical field theory . in general , the geometrical structure of spacetime as well as the intrinsic properties and the motion of material media can affect the light propagation .",
    "hence , a theoretical analysis of the latter ultimately results in establishing the properties of the ( genuine or effective  optical \" ) metric structure on the manifold .    in the generally covariant premetric approach to electrodynamics @xcite ,",
    "the axioms of electric charge and of magnetic flux conservation manifest themselves in the maxwell equations for the excitation @xmath0 and the field strength @xmath1 : @xmath2 these equations should be supplemented by a constitutive law @xmath3 .",
    "the latter relation contains the crucial information about the underlying physical continuum ( i.e. , about spacetime and/or about the material medium ) .",
    "mathematically , this constitutive law arises either from a suitable phenomenological theory of a medium or from the electromagnetic field lagrangian",
    ". it can be a nonlinear or even nonlocal relation between the electromagnetic excitation and the field strength .",
    "earlier , we have investigated the propagation of waves in the most general local and linear theory .",
    "one can conveniently split the constitutive relation into the three irreducible pieces which are known as the _ principal _ part , the _ skewon _ part and the _ axion _ part .",
    "it is important to stress that such a decomposition is intrinsically metricfree , and thus it suits nicely for the purpose of the study of the violations of the lorentz symmetry in the photon sector .",
    "more specifically , we investigated the influence of the axion and the skewon fields on the wave propagation by applying a linear response formalism , see @xcite .",
    "subsequently , itin @xcite studied birefringence caused by the axion field in the caroll - field - jackiw model of electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "more recently , we investigated the birefringence of electromagnetic waves and its consequences for the metric of spacetime @xcite .",
    "the possible limits of the lorentz symmetry can be seen in a particularly transparent way , both qualitatively and quantitatively , including also the case of a possible violation of the charge conservation law @xcite .",
    "the axion field and its interference with electrodynamics is a well - studied subject , and the same applies to the influence of the general principal part of the constitutive tensor which was thoroughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , this is not so in the case of the skewon field , a new structure which allows us to exhaust all 36 parameters of a linear spacetime relation ( exact definitions are given below ) .",
    "the only relevant earlier results are those of nieves and pal @xcite which were confined to the case of the spatially isotropic and constant scalar skewon field .",
    "in contrast , we present here some results which hold true for all electrodynamical models with an arbitrary local and linear _ spacetime relation _ that contains a nontrivial skewon part .",
    "we use the expression `` spacetime relation '' , since it applies to spacetime ( `` the vacuum '' ) itself , and in order to distinguish it from the constitutive law of a material medium . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the general local and linear spacetime relation is similar to the constitutive relation for matter with sufficiently complicated electric and magnetic properties . quite naturally",
    ", the study and the physical interpretation of the wave propagation in a manifold with a general spacetime relation appears to be very close to the analysis of the corresponding wave effects in crystal optics .",
    "the latter subject was extensively studied in the literature , see @xcite , for example . in particular , our analysis reveals the analogy of the effects of the real skewon field to the propagation of waves in absorbing media with circular dichroism , whereas the imaginary skewon field appears to be analogous to the optical activity tensor .",
    "if local coordinates @xmath4 are given , with @xmath5 , we can decompose the excitation and field strength 2-forms into their components according to @xmath6",
    "we confine ourselves to the case in which the electromagnetic excitation and the field strength are related by the local and linear constitutive law , @xmath7 the constitutive tensor @xmath8 has 36 independent components .",
    "one can decompose this object into its irreducible pieces .",
    "obviously , contraction is the only tool for such a decomposition . following post @xcite",
    ", we can define the contracted tensor of type @xmath9 $ ] @xmath10 with 16 independent components .",
    "the second contraction yields the pseudo - scalar function @xmath11 the traceless piece @xmath12 has 15 independent components .",
    "these pieces can now be subtracted out from the original constitutive tensor .",

    "one may call @xmath14 the principal , or the metric - dilaton part of the constitutive law . without such a term ,",
    "electromagnetic waves are ruled out , see @xcite .",
    "we further identify the two other irreducible parts with a _",
    "skewon _ and an _ axion _ field , respectively .",
    "conventionally , the skewon and the axion fields are introduced by @xmath19    the standard maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics arises when both skewon and axion vanish , whereas @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the vacuum impedance .",
    "a spacetime metric @xmath22 is assumed on the manifold , and with @xmath23 one defines @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that taking the linear spacetime relation for granted , one ends up at a riemannian lightcone provided one forbids birefringence in vacuum , see also @xcite .",
    "along with the original @xmath8-tensor , it is convenient to introduce an alternative representation of the constitutive tensor : @xmath26 substituting ( [ kap - dec ] ) into ( [ chikap ] ) , we find the corresponding decomposition @xmath27 with the principal , skewon , and axion pieces defined by @xmath28},\\label{chi2}\\\\ { } ^{(3)}\\chi^{ijkl } & = & { \\frac 1 2}\\,\\epsilon^{ijmn}\\,\\,{}^{(3 ) } \\kappa_{mn}{}^{kl } = { \\frac 1 { 12}}\\,\\epsilon^{ijkl}\\,\\kappa . \\label{chi3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the s - identity and the k - identity derived in @xcite , we can verify that @xmath29 is _ skew - symmetric _ under the exchange of the first and the second index pair , whereas @xmath30 is _ symmetric _ : @xmath31      making a @xmath32-decomposition @xcite of covariant electrodynamics , we can write @xmath33 and @xmath34 as column 6-vectors with the components built from the magnetic and electric excitation 3-vectors @xmath35 and electric and magnetic field strengths @xmath36 , respectively",
    ". then the linear spacetime relation ( [ hchif ] ) reads : @xmath37 here the constitutive tensor is conveniently represented by the 6-matrix @xmath38 the constitutive @xmath39 matrices @xmath40 are constructed from the components of the original constitutive tensor as @xmath41 if we resolve with respect to @xmath42 , we find the inverse formulas @xmath43    the contributions of the principal , the skewon , and the axion parts to the above constitutive 3-matrices can be written explicitly as @xmath44 the set of the symmetric matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 together with the traceless matrix @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) comprise the principal part @xmath49 of the constitutive tensor . usually , @xmath50 is called _ permittivity _ tensor and @xmath51 _ reciprocal permeability _ tensor ( `` impermeability '' tensor ) , since they describe the polarization and the magnetization of a medium , respectively .",
    "the magnetoelectric cross - term @xmath47 is related to the fresnel - fizeau effects .",
    "the skewon contributions in ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are responsible for the electric and magnetic faraday effects , respectively , whereas skewon terms in ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) describe optical activity .",
    "here we briefly summarize the results of previous work @xcite . in the hadamard approach ,",
    "one studies the propagation of a discontinuity in the first derivative of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the basic notions are then the fields of the _ wave _ covector and the _ ray _ vector that encode the information about the propagation of a wave in a spacetime with a general constitutive relation .",
    "the crucial observation about the surface of discontinuity @xmath52 ( defined locally by a function @xmath53 such that @xmath54 on @xmath52 ) is that across @xmath52 the geometric hadamard conditions are satisfied for the components of the electromagnetic field and their derivatives : @xmath55 = 0 , \\,[\\partial_i f_{jk } ] = q_i\\,f_{jk},\\,[h_{ij } ] = 0,\\,[\\partial_i h_{jk } ] = q_i\\ , h_{jk}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath56 is the wave covector . then using the maxwell equations ( [ me ] ) and the constitutive law ( [ hchif ] )",
    ", we find a system of algebraic equations for the jump functions : @xmath57    solving the last equation in ( [ 4dwave1 ] ) by means of @xmath58 , we finally reduce ( [ 4dwave1])@xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "this algebraic system has a nontrivial solution for @xmath61 only if the determinant of the matrix on the left hand side vanishes .",
    "the latter gives rise to our _ generalized covariant fresnel equation _",
    "@xmath62 with the fourth order tamm - rubilar ( tr )",
    "tensor density of weight @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 it is totally symmetric , @xmath65 , and thus has 35 independent components .",
    "different irreducible parts of the constitutive tensor ( [ kap - dec ] ) contribute differently to the general fresnel equation .",
    "a straightforward analysis @xcite shows that the axion piece drops out completely from the tr - tensor , whereas the two remaining irreducible parts of the constitutive tensor contributes to ( [ g4 ] ) as follows : @xmath66      a ray can be defined by a vector field @xmath67 that is _ dual _ to the wave covector @xmath68 and to the wave front in the following sense @xcite : @xmath69 here the 2-forms @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the jumps of the first derivatives of the electromagnetic field .",
    "equations ( [ svector ] ) are metric - free .",
    "the system of the first two equations can be analysed in complete analogy to the system ( [ 4dwave1 ] ) . as a result ,",

    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the possible influence of the skewon field @xmath81 on the electromagnetic wave propagation . for simplicity , we assume that the principal part of the constitutive tensor is determined by the maxwell - lorentz law ( [ ml ] ) , that is , @xmath82 however , the skewon structure will be kept as general as possible . as a preliminary step",

    "@xmath22 , we can decompose the skewon field into an antisymmetric and a symmetric part .",
    "the latter can be conveniently constructed from a pair of arbitrary ( co)vector fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so that we find eventually @xmath87 here @xmath88 is an arbitrary antisymmetric tensor and @xmath89 .",
    "such a parametrization produces almost a general skewon field , since the number of independent components is here @xmath90 .    substituting ( [ svec ] ) into ( [ propg8 ] ) and ( [ rayskew ] ) , and taking into account ( [ chi0 ] )",

    "adding the principal terms ( [ tr1 ] ) to the contributions of the skewon ( [ addtr1 ] ) and ( [ addtr2 ] ) , we see that neither the wave surface nor the ray surface decompose into the product of cones in general . in other words ,",
    "birefringence is absent .",
    "the last terms in ( [ addtr1 ] ) and in ( [ addtr2 ] ) are responsible for that .",
    "let us investigate those particular cases of the skewon field in the ` double vector ' representation ( [ svec ] ) which do admit the birefringence phenomenon .",
    "when the skewon field is represented by its antisymmetric part only , i.e. , @xmath95 @xmath96 ( which is obtained by putting both @xmath97 ) , then the analysis of ( [ propg8 ] ) shows that the light propagation is birefringent with one light cone defined by the spacetime metric @xmath98 and the second  optical \" metric @xmath99 this result actually holds true for any other parametrizations of the skewon field which will be considered later . at the same time , inspection of ( [ rayskew ] ) yields the decomposition of the ray surface into the light cone of the spacetime metric @xmath22 and a second cone defined by @xmath100 although ( [ opt1 ] ) and ( [ opt2 ] ) look very similar , we notice that they are not mutual inverse , and hence , they do not determine a unique geometric structure on spacetime .",

    "however , one can straightforwardly prove that for @xmath108 the optical metric has an euclidean signature .",
    "hence there is no wave propagation in this case .",
    "the type of the signature correlates with the sign of the determinant of the metric : the latter is negative for the lorentzian case and positive for the euclidean one .",
    "a direct computation yields @xmath109\\right\\}.\\label{det}\\ ] ] comparing this with ( [ ometpm ] ) , we identify the coefficient as @xmath110/2\\lambda_0 ^ 2 $ ] and finally obtain @xmath111.\\label{detpm}\\ ] ] since the spacetime metric is lorentzian , its determinant is negative , @xmath112 . as a result , we conclude that the optical metrics will be also lorentzian only if @xmath113 note that the two conditions ( [ u3 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) look pretty similar .",
    "in fact , we can verify that only one of them is an essential inequality .",
    "indeed , when the two vectors are either _ both _ timelike ( @xmath114 ) or _ both _ spacelike ( @xmath115 ) , the new condition ( [ u3 ] ) makes the constraint ( [ u2 ] ) redundant , whereas when at least one of the vectors is null , ( [ u3 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) coincide . finally ,",
    "when one of the vectors is timelike and another spacelike , the only essential condition is ( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) is redundant .    with these conditions , we can classify the effects of the skewon field on wave propagation .",
    "the spatially isotropic skewon field of nieves & pal @xcite , for example , belongs to the subcase when the two vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 are proportional to each other . indeed ,",
    "let us consider the ( flat ) minkowski spacetime with the lorentzian metric @xmath118 , and let us put @xmath119 with some scalar function @xmath52 of dimension @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "then , from ( [ svec ] ) , we recover the isotropic skewon field @xmath121 as a result , the spacetime relation becomes @xmath122 accordingly , in the special case when skewon and axion become _ constant _ fields , one can speak of the 4 electromagnetic constants for a vacuum spacetime with spatial isotropy : the electric constant @xmath123 , the magnetic constant @xmath124 , the spatially isotropic part @xmath52 of the skewon @xmath81 , and the axion @xmath125 .    in this special case",
    "we evidently find @xmath126 .",
    "hence ( [ detpm ] ) yields that both optical metrics have a wrong euclidean signature .",
    "this is in complete agreement with our earlier observations @xcite in which the absence of wave propagation was reported on the background of the isotropic skewon field of nieves & pal .",
    "however , now we obviously obtain a far more general result : whereas nieves & pal have considered only a very special configuration with the spacelike vectors @xmath117 and @xmath116 being proportional to each other , the wave propagation is actually also absent for any @xmath127 and any riemannian spacetime metric @xmath22 . then again @xmath128 and",
    "hence @xmath129 .",
    "it is impossible to construct a general parametrization of the skewon field by using covariant 4-dimensional objects .",
    "instead , we have to switch to the space and time decomposition techniques and to allow for the use of 3-dimensional ( 3d ) tensor objects",
    ". then we can write the required parametrization as follows : @xmath130 here @xmath131 and @xmath132 are 3d ( co)vector fields , whereas @xmath133 is a 3d tensor of type @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "from now on , the indices from the beginning of the latin alphabet denote the spatial 3d components , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
    "the count of the independent components , namely @xmath136 , shows that we indeed have the most general representation of the skewon field .",
    "it is straightforward to establish the dimensions of the different pieces of skewon field : we find that @xmath137 = [ \\lambda_0]$ ] , @xmath138 = [ \\varepsilon_0]$ ] and @xmath139 = 1/[\\mu_0]$ ] .    with this general parametrization , the linear spacetime relation ( [ cr ] )",
    "can be written symbolically as follows : @xmath140 here the linear operator on the right - hand side explicitly reads : @xmath141    now we again specialize to the maxwell - lorentz principal part ( [ chi0 ] ) .",
    "moreover , since we are specifically interested in the skewon effects , we will assume for concreteness that the spacetime metric is the _",
    "flat minkowskian _",
    "one with lorentzian signature , @xmath142 .",
    "the euclidean 3-metric tensor @xmath143 should not be confused with the kronecker delta : the components of the latter are always either 0 or 1 , whereas the former has these values in cartesian coordinates only .",
    "then one can further decompose the 3d skewon tensor into its symmetric and skewsymmetric parts : @xmath144 here @xmath145 , and the 3d indices are raised and lowered by means of the euclidean 3d metric , i.e. , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the covector field @xmath148 describes the antisymmetric part of the 3d tensor skewon .",
    "obviously , both irreducible parts of the tensor skewon have the same dimension @xmath149 = [ z_c ] = [ \\lambda_0]$ ] .",
    "the analysis of the wave propagation in the presence of the general skewon field ( [ sgen ] ) is not possible in the above covariant 4-dimensional framework .",
    "since the space and time components are explicitly separated in the general parametrization ( [ sgen ] ) , we need a corresponding approach to the wave and ray surfaces in which a space and time decomposition has been performed .    namely , let us denote the independent components of the tr - tensor ( [ g4 ] ) as follows : @xmath150\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad + ( { \\cal c}^d{}_c + { \\cal d}_c{}^d)({\\cal a}^{c(a}{\\cal c}^{b)}{}_d   + { \\cal d}_d{}^{(a}{\\cal a}^{b)c } ) - { \\cal c}^d{}_d{\\cal a}^{c(a}{\\cal c}^{b ) } { } _ c\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad - { \\cal d}_c{}^{(a}{\\cal a}^{b)c}{\\cal d}_d{}^d -    { \\cal a}^{dc}{\\cal c}^{(a}{}_c { \\cal d}_d{}^{b ) } +     \\left({\\cal a}^{(ab)}{\\cal a}^{dc}- { \\cal a}^{d(a}{\\cal a}^{b)c}\\right )     { \\cal b}_{dc}\\,,\\label{ma2}\\\\ m^{abc } & : = & 4\\,{\\cal g}^{0abc } =    \\epsilon^{de(c|}\\left[{\\cal b}_{df } ( { \\cal a}^{ab)}\\,{\\cal d}_e^{\\ f }    - { \\cal d}_e^{\\ a}{\\cal a}^{b)f}\\ , ) \\right .",

    "the birefringence type effects represent the observable consequences of the model and the corresponding measurements impose limits on the lorentz - violating parameters in the general linear spacetime relation .",
    "it was shown previously @xcite by using cosmological and laboratory observations that the birefringence - related parameters of the principal part of the constitutive tensor must be smaller than @xmath264 .    in this paper",
    "we investigated the general covariant fresnel equation for the wave covectors as well as for the ray vectors in the case of a linear spacetime relation ( [ hchif ] ) that connects the electromagnetic excitation with the field strength . strictly speaking , the physical information contained in the ray vector surface",
    "is the same as that in the wave covector surface .",
    "the reason why we still analyzed the ray along with the wave surfaces is twofold .",
    "firstly , we developed the four - dimensional covariant approach to the ray surfaces in complete analogy with the earlier results obtained for the fresnel wave surfaces .",
    "such a formalism might be helpful in the study of the various aspects of the wave propagation in media , since the construction of the ray surfaces is quite a common tool in crystal optics , see @xcite .",
    "secondly , we demonstrated explicitly that although the ray surface is dual to the wave surface ( which is also clearly seen from the figures above ) , the optical metric , which is naturally derived in the case of birefringence , is different for the wave and for the ray surfaces and the two metrics derived are _ not _ dual to each other .",
    "the skewon part ( [ salpha])@xmath59 , ( [ chi2 ] ) of the constitutive tensor was in the center of our study .",
    "we introduced its general parametrization ( [ sgen ] ) .",
    "this enabled us to distiguish between three different types of effects : the electric and magnetic faraday effects and the ( magneto - electric ) optical activity .",
    "the influence of a skewon field on the fresnel wave and ray surfaces is qualitatively different in these three case .",
    "this is illustrated in the figures in the corresponding subsections of sec .",
    "[ effects ] .",
    "however , the characteristic sign of the skewon is the emergence of the specific _ holes in the fresnel surfaces _ that correspond to the directions in space along which the wave propagation is damped out completely .",
    "this effect is in complete agreement with our earlier conclusion on the dissipative nature of the skewon field @xcite .    besides the qualitative results ,",
    "one may derive numerical limits on the magnitude of the skewon components from the experimental search for the anisotropy of the velocity of light . using the data for the gamma - ray bursts and following @xcite",
    ", we then obtain the estimates @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "this shows that if the skewon indeed spoils the light cone structure ( yielding a violation of the lorentz symmetry and an anisotropy of the propagation of light ) , its influence should be extremely small . as a final remark",
    "we note that the experimental laboratory data @xcite imposes much stronger constraints on the principal part of the constitutive tensor ( see the corresponding analysis in @xcite ) , and we can expect that the same will be true for the skewon too since the theoretical formalisms are pretty much the same in both cases .    .",
