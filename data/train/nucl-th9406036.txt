    "phenomenological local potentials are conventionally used in nuclear physics for the description of @xmath1 interaction , nucleon - cluster or cluster - cluster interactions , etc .",
    "nevertheless , interaction between quantum particles is nonlocal in nature .",
    "the nonlocality arises from the composite structure of interacting particles , e.g. , from the quark structure of nucleons ; it appears as a result of relativistic effects or of the truncation of a model space , etc .",
    "the nonlocality can give rise to some peculiarities in scattering and/or in the structure of bound states .",
    "we shall show that a system with a nonlocal interaction can have a bound state of a special type that we shall refer to as isolated state ( is ) .",
    "is is a state with dying asymptotics like a usual bound state but is is not in correspondence with any of @xmath0-matrix poles .",
    "is can have negative or positive energy ; in the later case , is appears to be a bound state embedded in continuum ( bsec ) that have been studied both for local @xcite and nonlocal @xcite interactions .",
    "we shall present a model finite - rank separable interaction giving rise to is .",
    "exact solutions of the corresponding schrdinger equation can be easily found in the @xmath3-matrix formulation of the scattering theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-matrix approach is based on the fourier - expansion of continuum spectra wave functions in terms of @xmath4 basis functions . in particular",
    ", the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions as well as the so - called sturm - laguerre functions can be used as the basis functions in the method .",
    "the important point of this approach is the fact that the matrix of the kinetic energy operator @xmath5 is of a tridiagonal form on the oscillator or sturm - laguerre basis , i.e. , the kinetic energy matrix is a jacobi matrix ( or , shortly , @xmath3-matrix ) .",
    "the main advantage of this formalism in comparison with currently used formalisms in the scattering theory is the fact that it deals with algebraic rather than differential or integrodifferential equations .",
    "the radial wave function @xmath6 satisfies the schrdinger equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy , @xmath9 is the angular momentum , @xmath5 is the kinetic energy operator , while an interaction in the system we describe by a separable nonlocal potential , @xmath10 of the rank @xmath11 with the harmonic oscillator formfactors , @xmath12 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left ( \\frac{r}{r_{0 } } \\right ) ^{l+1 } \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{r^2}{2r^{2}_{0 } } \\right ) l_{n}^{l+\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left ( \\frac{r^2}{r_{0}^{2 } } \\right ) .",

    "the corresponding wave functions are dying as @xmath48 similarly to the wave functions of bound states since they are linear combinations of a finite number of the functions ( [ ( 3 ) ] ) .",

    "all eigenstates of the submatrix @xmath44 will be referred to as isolated states ( is ) , because they are isolated completely from the scattering states .",
    "the continuum spectrum states with oscillation  type asymptotics of the wave function as well as the usual bound states with @xmath51type asymptotics of the wave functions , are expressed as infinite series ( [ ( 4 ) ] ) .",

    "an interesting new point , so far as we know never discussed in literature , is the appearance of the discrete spectrum states , i.e. , ises with negative energy @xmath58 , that are divorced from @xmath0-matrix poles .",

    "the single @xmath0-matrix pole in the non - physical sheet tends to the real energy point @xmath80 as @xmath76 tends to zero .",

    "however , in the limit @xmath77 , the factor @xmath85 in the numerator of ( [ ( 10 ) ] ) cancels the same factor in the denominator and the singularity in the point @xmath86 in ( [ ( 10 ) ] ) disappears , i.e. , the @xmath0-matrix in the presence of bsec has no poles .",
    "nontrivial result is that if is belongs to the discrete spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , it does nt generate @xmath0-matrix pole , too .",
    "the above results can be generalized as a following    theorem .",
    "let all the eigenvalues of the truncated hamiltonian matrix @xmath88 be non - degenerate .",

    "these eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are just the energies and the wave functions of the isolated states , respectively .",
    "it means that each is is a linear combination of the finite number of the harmonic oscillator functions @xmath93 @xmath94 and its asymptotical behavior @xmath95 is not connected with its energy .",

    "the results given above can be strightforwardly generalized on the case of coupled channels problem , on the case of separable nonlocal potentials of finite rank with the sturm - laguerre formfactors , etc .    as for physical applications",
    ", it should be noted that the is appears in variational calculations using the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "it is well - known @xcite ( the dubovoy - flores theorem ) that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath99 of the matrix @xmath88 coincides with the lowest eigenvalue @xmath99 of the matrix @xmath90 if the parameter @xmath100 of the basis functions minimizes the eigenvalue @xmath101 . according to our theorem ,",
    "it means that the corresponding eigenstate @xmath102 will be is .",
    "another physical application may concern the @xmath1 potential that should be nonlocal from the point of view of the quark model . a simple two - color `` toy '' model of @xmath1 interaction considered in ref .",
    "@xcite yields the separable nonlocal potential of the type described above with @xmath103 and @xmath104 while @xmath105 has a tendency to cancel @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the non - relativistic @xmath1 scattering problem arising in the quark resonating group model is close to the situation with bsec .",
    "if is is really inherent to the @xmath1-interaction , it may be used for explanation of the impressive success of the deep attractive potential with forbidden states description of @xmath1 scattering @xcite . to illustrate",
    "the usefulness of using potentials with is for the description of @xmath1 interaction , we make fit to @xmath1 scattering data by the potential of the type ( [ ( 2 ) ] ) .",
    "the singlet and triplet @xmath2-wave @xmath1 scattering phases are well reproduced by second - rank ( @xmath60 ) potential ( [ ( 2 ) ] ) with @xmath107 mev and @xmath108 mev , @xmath109 mev ; @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fixed by the condition @xmath112 .",
