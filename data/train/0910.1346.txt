    "these interpretations rely on one - dimensional , steady - state radiative transfer models describing in great detail the atmospheric structure that is expected at radiative and chemical equilibrium . on the other hand , these models usually consider only globally averaged atmospheric properties and they often ignore the role of horizontal heat transport by advection on the energetic balance of the modeled atmospheres . such shortcomings of radiative transfer models could eventually limit our ability to reliably infer the physical conditions present in remotely observed exoplanetary atmospheres .    planetary atmospheres which satisfy global radiative equilibrium",
    "are generally not in local radiative equilibrium , that is along a specific vertical column , because of finite contributions from horizontal heat fluxes .",
    "the role of atmospheric circulation in shaping the structure and properties of hot jupiter atmospheres has been recognized as an increasingly important ingredient over the last few years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and several groups have been developing multi - dimensional atmospheric models to address this issue more explicitly @xcite .    even in a three - dimensional , time - dependent atmospheric model of the type known as `` general circulation model '' ( gcm ) , radiative",

    "the radiative transfer component of the problem , which is needed to continuously evaluate the net diabatic heating or cooling rate of the gas in motion , is solved independently of the atmospheric motions themselves , as if the atmosphere were actually static .    here",

    "much of the astrophysical literature on radiation - hydrodynamics is focused on the radiative transfer of radially expanding stellar winds .",

    "to lowest order in @xmath0 , the radiative transfer equation in a moving medium can be written    @xmath2 [ i ( {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$ } }   } , {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$n$ } }   } , \\nu)-s ( {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$ } }   } , {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$n$ } }   } , \\nu)],\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the monochromatic intensity ( per unit solid angle ) at frequency @xmath4 and spatial location @xmath5 in the direction defined by the unit vector @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the source function , @xmath8 is the material velocity field , @xmath9 is the line integrated opacity , @xmath10 is the line central frequency and @xmath11 is the line profile function , normalized to unity .",

    "by contrast , a uniform velocity field leads to a more trivial , uniform frequency shift . in the context of stellar wind theory , equation  ( [ eq : one ] )",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is not the limit of interest for hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "the literature on radiative transfer in static atmospheres is vast and the reader is directed to the monographs by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for detailed accounts on this subject . to make the connection with that work",
    ", we now introduce the plane - parallel atmosphere approximation , using @xmath14 as the vertical coordinate in the atmosphere .",

    "we further assume that local thermodynamic equilibrium is satisfied and we neglect scattering , as is generally justified for the thermal portion of the atmospheric radiation spectrum .. ] the source function @xmath7 then reduces to the planck function , @xmath20 .",
    "in that case , the formal solution to the radiative transfer equation for the monochromatic intensity at level @xmath21 in the direction @xmath22 can be written @xcite :    @xmath23    where the monochromatic notation has been changed to @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponds to a bounding region for the atmosphere ( e.g. , the bulk interior ) , with a one - sided radiative boundary condition specified as @xmath26 . the first term on the rhs of eq .",

    "is carried along rays which are significantly slanted relative to the vertical , even though net flux exchange between atmospheric layers occurs vertically .",
    "the next step in deriving vertical flux equations for the atmospheric radiation problem typically involves separate angular integrations for the ascending ( @xmath33 ) and descending ( @xmath34 ) fluxes @xcite , of the type    @xmath35    to account for the phase space available at slanted angles , it is customary in `` two - stream '' formulations to replace all angular integrals over transmissivities by a single average transmissivity value for a characteristic zenith angle , @xmath36 :    @xmath37 \\mu d\\mu d\\phi \\nonumber \\\\   \\simeq \\pi \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 }    \\int_z^{z_0 } k_\\nu(z ' ; \\mu_0 ) \\rho(z ' ; \\mu_0 ) dz'\\right ] \\equiv \\bar{{\\cal t}}_\\nu(z , z_0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the hemispherically - averaged `` diffusive transmissivity .

    "this approximation has been shown to yield errors @xmath39 in typical applications for static atmospheres , when a diffusivity factor @xmath40 is adopted @xcite , which corresponds to a zenith angle @xmath41  deg .",
    "this relatively large value of the effective zenith angle illustrates well the large phase space available for thermal radiation at slanted angles .",
    "it indicates that the projected wind velocity along a typical optical path for thermal atmospheric radiation can be a significant fraction of the full horizontal wind speed , even though net radiative exchanges between the atmospheric layers occur in the vertical .",
    "to help us focus our discussion further , we now turn to issues specific to hot jupiter atmospheres .      over the last few years",
    ", various circulation models have indicated that wind speeds could reach sonic or even supersonic values in the upper atmospheres of hot jupiters @xcite . here ,",
    "for concreteness , we use the specific hot jupiter model described in @xcite to evaluate the magnitude of projected velocity gradients along representative optical paths for thermal radiation in a dynamic hot jupiter atmosphere .",
    "a specific optical path is defined by a starting location at the bottom of the model atmosphere and by a unit vector @xmath6 which defines the path orientation .",
    "we calculate the projected wind velocity along this path throughout the entire model atmosphere as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the wind horizontal velocity vector according to the circulation model , @xmath44 is the horizontal unit vector projected on the sphere ( i.e. , defining the north / south and east / west directions ) and the representative zenith angle @xmath41  deg is uniformly adopted in all our calculations .",
    "a detailed calculation would require us to take into account the three - dimensional geometry of the problem , with varying pressure levels in each of the model vertical columns crossed by the slanted optical path . rather than performing delicate three - dimensional interpolations between various model columns",
    ", we use the profile of wind velocities in a single vertical column .",
    "that is , we use values of @xmath43 as if the optical path were exactly vertical , even though the calculation assumes a zenith angle @xmath41  deg and various azimuthal orientations for the projection .",
    "while this approximation clearly emphasizes vertical velocity gradients over horizontal ones , it still captures representative changes in @xmath43 , both in magnitude and direction , along the selected optical path ( with a specific azimuthal orientation ) .",
    "it should thus be sufficient to evaluate the typical magnitude of projected velocity gradients along representative optical paths in the model atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows profiles of wind velocity projected along representative optical paths , as a function of pressure , @xmath45 ( a proxy for height in the atmosphere ) .",
    "all velocities are expressed in units of the local value of the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath46 . the same @xmath47-dominated atmospheric gas parameters as in @xcite are used to calculate the sound speed : @xmath48 , with an adiabatic index @xmath49 , @xmath50 and a gas constant @xmath51 j kg@xmath52 k@xmath52 .",
    "the various panels show profiles at the model substellar point ( a ) , antistellar point ( b ) , west equatorial terminator ( c ) and north pole ( d ) . in each panel ,",
    "the various curves show projected velocity profiles for optical paths oriented to the east ( solid line ) , north - east ( dotted ) , north ( dashed ) and north - west ( dash - dotted ) on the sphere . projected velocity profiles for other cardinal directions",
    "can be deduced by symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] reveals significant gradients in projected wind velocity as one crosses the atmosphere along representative slanted optical paths for thermal radiation . velocity differentials over one pressure scale height easily amount to @xmath53- @xmath54 and they exceed @xmath55 in some cases , especially high up in the atmosphere .",
    "velocity differentials @xmath56 are typical when crossing several pressure scale heights .",
    "the different panels in figure  [ fig : one ] illustrate the diverse character of projected velocity profiles at various locations around the planet .",
    "furthermore , panels a ) , b ) and c ) exemplify the anisotropic nature of these projected velocity profiles . projected velocity gradients are systematically weak in the north ( or equivalently south ) direction but they can become significant when the east - west direction is sufficiently sampled by the optical path under consideration .",
    "this is easily understood as resulting from the predominantly zonal ( east - west ) nature of winds in this and other hot jupiter atmospheric circulation models @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that the azimuthal angular phase space for thermal radiation will be dominated by optical paths sampling significant velocity gradients , with unusually low gradient values relevant only for the small fraction of all paths that are closely aligned with the north - south direction . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : dynatm ] , to the extent that projected velocity gradients of the magnitude shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] impact the transport of thermal radiation , the radiative transfer problem will become anisotropic via the sampling of a variety of azimuthal and zenith angles , even when the planck source function itself is isotropic ( in the fluid frame ) .",
    "opacity sources in hot jupiter atmospheres are largely dominated by discrete atomic and molecular lines , particularly in the thermal portion of the atmospheric radiation spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lines are broadened well beyond their quantum mechanical width through doppler shifts associated with the thermal motions of atomic and molecular constituents ( `` doppler broadening '' ) and through the effect of collisions of these atoms and molecules with other gas constituents ( `` pressure broadening '' ) .",
    "the relative width of doppler and pressure broadening depends on the local conditions of density and temperature in the atmosphere , as well as on the specific radiative constituent under consideration .",
    "the general shape of a line that is both doppler- and pressure - broadened , i.e. the detailed functional form of the line function @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) , is given by the voigt function @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one expects the radiation transport in an atmosphere with strongly pressure - broadened lines and very subsonic wind speeds to be relatively insensitive to the additional doppler shifts due to bulk flow velocities projected along various optical paths .",
    "indeed , the typical thermal width of a doppler - broadened line is closely related to the sound speed of the atmospheric gas ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : dnud ] ] below ) , so that bulk line shifts should only minimally deform line shapes in the limit of very subsonic wind speeds .",
    "this , combined with the dominance of pressure broadening , is the main justification behind the use of a static treatment for radiation transport in solar system planetary atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to evaluate the possible role of bulk doppler shifts for radiation transport in hot jupiter atmospheres , it is thus important to evaluate the shapes and widths of radiative lines in these atmospheres .",
    "various static , globally - averaged radiative transfer studies have established that the radiatively forced regions of hot jupiter atmospheres are found , broadly speaking , above the 10100 bar pressure level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regions in the pressure range from @xmath58 to @xmath59 bars are thus of particular interest for the study of radiation transport in dynamic hot jupiter atmospheres .    a detailed account of the typical treatment of lines in static radiative transfer calculations for hot jupiter atmospheres is provided by @xcite .",

    "pressure broadening generally depends on pressure , temperature and the radiative constituent under consideration but the `` classical '' scaling    @xmath64    with a @xmath65 power law dependence on temperature , should be sufficient for our order - of - magnitude estimates @xcite .",
    "doppler broadening depends on temperature , wavelength ( @xmath66 ) and the mass , @xmath67 , of the radiative constituent under consideration ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the mass of the @xmath70 molecule ( the dominant atmospheric constituent ) , @xmath71 is the gas adiabatic index and @xmath55 is the corresponding adiabatic sound speed .",
    "this scaling illustrates how the doppler width is reduced for radiative constituents which are typically more massive than molecular hydrogen .",
    "note that the linear scaling of @xmath62 with the central wavelength @xmath72 implies significant doppler width variations across the relevant optical - ir spectral range .",
    "substantial variations in temperature on constant pressure levels are found , from day- to night - side , in current atmospheric circulation models for hot jupiters @xcite . here , for simplicity",
    ", we choose @xmath73  k and @xmath74  k as representative temperature values at the @xmath75 bar and @xmath76 bar levels , respectively ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "k , the ratio becomes @xmath88 at @xmath84 and @xmath89 at @xmath86 .",
    "doppler broadening is thus significant at the 1 bar level , especially in the near - ir and the optical , and it becomes increasingly dominant across the entire optical - ir spectral range higher up in the atmosphere .    the sizable contribution of thermal doppler broadening to the width of radiative lines at photospheric levels in hot jupiter atmospheres , together with the scaling @xmath90 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dnud ] ) , suggests that bulk doppler shifts from atmospheric motions near the sound speed could modify the shapes of radiative lines significantly .",
    "by contrast , much deeper in the atmosphere , where @xmath91 , doppler shifts from bulk atmospheric motions near the sound speed would only amount to small shifts over comparatively wide , pressure - broadened lines .",
    "furthermore , wind speeds themselves may be reduced at these deeper levels ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig : one ] ) .",
    "these qualitative arguments are not very informative about the possible consequences of bulk doppler shifts on radiation transport in a dynamic atmosphere .",
    "in particular , since the doppler cores of radiative lines are often very optically thick ( `` saturated '' ) in hot jupiter and other planetary atmospheres , they do not necessarily contribute much to the overall atmospheric energy budget , at least in the static case .",

    "this simple model isolates the effects of bulk doppler shifts by assuming that the path is otherwise homogeneous . in a more realistic atmospheric model , optical paths would be inhomogeneous , with line strengths , @xmath96 , generally varying with temperature and line shapes , @xmath103 , generally varying with both temperature and pressure along the specific path @xcite . ) ,  ( [ eq : four ] ) and  ( [ eq : voigt ] ) requires one to account for the profile variation with pressure and temperature separately for each individual line along the optical path of interest . a very common simplifying assumption in the treatment of atmospheric radiation , known as the curtis - godson approximation , is to treat the optical path as if it were homogeneous , i.e. with constant pressure and temperature , and use adequately path - averaged values for the line strength , shape and the absorber amount ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the various curves show models with line integrated absorption coefficient @xmath144 ( dashed line ) , @xmath145 ( dotted ; same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) , @xmath146 ( solid ) , @xmath147 ( dash - dotted ) and @xmath148 ( triple - dot dashed ) .",
    "while the ew excesses increase with the value of @xmath101 , the exact dependence is not entirely trivial . for @xmath149 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , ew excesses from several tens of percents to more than a hundred percent are possible , for the same range of @xmath101 values as deemed relevant for hot jupiter atmospheres earlier .",
    "figure  [ fig : four ] shows the systematic variation of the ew excess with the magnitude of the total line absorption coefficient , @xmath150 , in a model with a value of the total velocity offset fixed at @xmath151  @xmath142 .",
    "the various curves show models with voigt function broadening ratios @xmath152 ( dashed line ) , @xmath153 ( dotted ; same as in figs .",
    "[ fig : two ] and  [ fig : three ] ) , @xmath154 ( solid ) and @xmath74 ( dash - dotted ) . the ew excess first increases with the value of @xmath96 , peaks around @xmath155-@xmath156 and then drops at larger @xmath96 values .",
    "peak ew excesses are thus reached for rather strong optically thick conditions .",
    "note that ew excesses @xmath157-@xmath158 are possible for @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161  @xmath142 .",
    "ew excesses easily reach several tens of percents at @xmath162 in all of the models considered here , for the rather large value of @xmath151  @xmath142 adopted ( see again fig .  [ fig : three ] for the dependence with @xmath101 ) .",
    "we can understand various trends in the behavior of the ew excesses with @xmath163 , @xmath96 and @xmath164 in our simple models as follows .",
    "as already mentioned earlier , we have found that the shifts and distortions of monochromatic transmissivity profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] are qualitatively representative of the general behavior seen in all our models , whether the line is in the optically thin or optically thick regime . for a line well into the optically thick regime ( @xmath165 )",
    ", the growth in ew with @xmath163 can be simply understood as a stretching of the optically thick portion of the transmissivity curve , which contributes maximally to the growth in ew according to the integral in equation  ( [ eq : ew ] ) .",
    "this is the main trend observed for moderate to high values of @xmath96 in figure  [ fig : three ] .    in the optically thin regime",
    ", the increase in ew excess with @xmath96 can be understood as resulting from the presence of larger radiative intensities outside the line center ( where maximum absorption occurs ) , so that doppler - shifted absorption around the line center contributes increasingly to the ew excess . as the value of @xmath96",
    "is increased well into the optically thick regime , however , the much shallower pressure - broadened wings of the voigt line profile start making a significant contribution to the ew integral , over an increasingly wider range of frequencies .",
    "this reduces the effective contribution of the optically - thick , shifted doppler core to the total line ew , which explains the decline in ew excess at large @xmath96 values in figure  [ fig : four ] , the more so in models with larger values of the pressure - broadening parameter , @xmath61 .",
    "our main result has been to establish the possibility that bulk doppler shifts from fast , sonic or transonic wind speeds in hot jupiter atmospheres could affect radiation transport and thus in principle influence the overall radiative structure of these atmospheres .",
    "we have quantified the magnitude of these effects with simplified transmissivity models in a dynamic atmosphere , by assuming that linear bulk velocity gradients are present along otherwise homogeneous optical paths and by adopting voigt line profile parameters appropriate for the radiatively forced regions of hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "we have found that bulk doppler shifts systematically increase the equivalent widths of isolated radiative lines , relative to the equivalent widths in a static atmosphere , with excesses easily reaching several tens of percents for relevant model parameters .",
    "flux errors below the few percent level may well be acceptable in atmospheric models currently used to interpret the increasingly rich set of observational data on hot jupiter atmospheres since other important atmospheric unknowns also contribute to modeling errors ( e.g. , the exact compositional profiles of radiatively active constituents ) .",
    "flux errors at the level of several tens of percents or more may be too large to be ignored , however , especially if they originate from systematic excesses in the equivalent widths of important radiative lines . given the link between line equivalent widths and radiative intensities discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ew ] in the context of the narrow - band formalism , we therefore suggest that equivalent width excesses of the magnitude found in several of our idealized models could have a significant impact on radiative fluxes and the overall radiative energy balance of hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "however , we must also caution that , beyond these preliminary arguments , it is not possible to settle this question without a considerably more detailed calculation than the one presented here .",
    "indeed , it is the combined effect of bulk doppler shifts on a vast number of radiative lines , all with varying degrees of optical thickness , weighted by the various planck functions of the atmospheric layers under consideration ( thus depending on the atmospheric temperature profile itself ) , along a variety of inhomogeneous optical paths , which ultimately determines by how much the overall radiative balance of the dynamic atmosphere is affected .",
    "by contrast , our simple transmissivity and equivalent width models were focused on single isolated lines with purely linear velocity gradients along arbitrary , homogeneous optical paths .",
    "furthermore , contributions from continuum opacity sources in the atmosphere , for instance in cloudy regions , could reduce the impact of bulk doppler shifts on the atmospheric radiation transport , since small shifts mostly affect narrow radiative lines .",
    "various simplifying assumptions made in our models would thus be invalidated in a more realistic radiative transport calculation .",
    "interestingly , the full radiation transport problem in a dynamic atmosphere may be amenable to practical numerical solutions in the future ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that our discussion has largely focused on the long - wavelength ( thermal ) component of the atmospheric radiation spectrum , for which the diffuse approximation and the use of an isotropic ( planck ) source function are justified . at first",
    ", one may be tempted to neglect the effects of bulk doppler shifts from horizontal winds in the treatment of short - wavelength atmospheric radiation since the corresponding beam - like insolation is vertical in first approximation .",
    "this could be misleading , however .",
    "when scattering is important , as is usually the case , it generates optical paths slanted enough that they could become much more susceptible to the bulk doppler shifts caused by horizontal winds . furthermore , there is a significant fraction of the atmosphere that is located far enough away from the substellar point to be subject to partially slanted irradiation . in the case of close - in planets like hot jupiters , the finite size of the stellar disk",
    "could also contribute to slanted irradiation and thus an increased sensitivity to doppler shifts from horizontal winds .",
    "let us emphasize that radiation transport in a dynamic atmosphere with an anisotropic source function , as would result from multiple scattering of the beam - like insolation in the short - wavelength portion of the atmospheric radiation spectrum , would lead to a considerably more complex formulation of the radiative transfer problem than discussed here for the case of diffuse thermal radiation ( e.g. , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : two ] ] ) .",
    "for example , one wonders whether the anisotropic transport resulting from atmospheric bulk motions could result in a stronger polarization signal than has been estimated on the basis of static radiative transfer calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , the various short - wavelength radiation transport effects mentioned above should be particularly pronounced in the context of transmission spectroscopic measurements , which specifically probe nearly horizontal optical paths at the atmospheric planetary limb during transits .",
    "essentially all transit spectroscopic diagnostics could thus be affected by bulk doppler shifts from fast atmospheric winds .",
    "@xcite has presented a detailed discussion of this problem , including consequences of the vertical gradients of horizontal wind velocity .",
    "the possibly more important effects of bulk doppler shifts along a specific optical path were omitted from these calculations , however , even though the author did comment on the expectation of increased line equivalent widths .",
    "it may thus prove important to carefully reassess various interpretations about the chemical composition of hot jupiter atmospheres based on transit spectroscopic measurements with models which properly account for radiation transport in dynamic , rather than static , atmospheres .",
    "finally , let us conclude by mentioning a few possible extensions of this work to other classes of planetary atmospheres .",
    "it would seem that the standard static assumption for the treatment of radiation transport in solar system planetary atmospheres is well justified .",
    "indeed , for these much cooler atmospheres , at a representative pressure level of 1 bar , radiative lines are significantly more pressure - broadened in solar system atmospheres than in hot jupiter atmospheres ( see scalings in  [ sec : widths ] ) . in that limit , and for wind speeds well below the sound speed , our models do indicate very small excesses in the equivalent width of radiative lines . by contrast",
    ", the typically much hotter planets discovered by astronomers in recent years , which are often subject to unusually strong radiative forcing conditions , would seem to be more natural sites for the application of the radiation - hydrodynamical principles emphasized in the present work .",
    "besides hot jupiters , these principles could also find applications in the class of eccentric giant planets which experience transient atmospheric flash - heating during periastron passage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and perhaps the emerging class of hot super - earths , if the atmospheres of these planets are able to sustain wind velocities approaching or exceeding the sound speed in the presence of significant ground drag .",
