    "in this paper , we study the problem of discrete polynomial blending , a discretization of the problem of curve blending . in curve blending ,",
    "one approximates a bivariate function by interpolating to a network of curves extracted from the graph of the function .",
    "discrete blending involves a second level of discretization , whereby the blended curves are interpolated at finite sets of points .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fblend1 ] . in the figure ,",
    "the blended interpolant would interpolate to the 9 curves ( 4 horizontal and 5 vertical ) in the network , while the discrete blended surface interpolates at @xmath0 grid points . in our work",
    ", the term `` interpolation '' can be taken loosely to mean interpolation with respect to a given set of functionals , and may not necessarily imply point evaluation .    the grid in fig .",
    "[ fblend1 ] is not uniform due to gaps between some grid points .",
    "if we filled in these holes we would have a uniform grid with @xmath1 points that can be interpolated using tensor product polynomials .",
    "hence , we can interpolate at just @xmath0 points rather than @xmath2 , and in some cases do so with the same ( or nearly the same ) rate of approximation , as we shall show in this paper . in discrete polynomial blending ,",
    "the approximating spaces are not generally tensor product polynomial spaces ( although that is a special case ) .",
    "as it turns out , our approximating spaces are the `` sum of tensor product polynomial spaces '' .",
    "hence , our study is one of approximation from the sum of tensor product polynomial spaces .",
    "what is known about discrete blending comes mainly from the literature on boolean sum interpolation , sparse grid methods , lower set interpolation and finite elements .",
    "the topic was perhaps first studied by biermann @xcite who constructed polynomial interpolants using the bivariate lagrange basis .",
    "the book @xcite is an excellent summary of boolean sum methods , including an analysis of biermann interpolation . in @xcite",
    ", a construction was given that generalized biermann interpolation to interpolation with respect to more general sequences of functionals , much like we will do in this paper .",
    "biermann interpolation was generalized to higher dimensions in @xcite , under the title `` d - variate boolean interpolation '' , and more recently to arbitrary `` lower sets '' in @xcite ( which reduces to the results in @xcite for total degree interpolation ) .    in this paper",
    "we construct a new discrete blended quasi - interpolant based on the bernstein basis .",
    "to do so , we will bring in some techniques on `` dual basis in subspaces '' that the author has studied in @xcite . from this",
    "we construct dual bases for the space of discrete blending , and compute approximation estimates .",
    "one of the main contributions is to show our quasi - interpolants achieve rates of approximation comparable or the same as that of tensor product interpolation on a larger grid , but with much fewer data points .",
    "this leads us to the construction of a quasi - interpolant analogous to the serendipity elements in the finite element method .",
    "the results presented in this paper originate from a talk by the author at the conference on curves and surfaces in oslo , norway , in 2012 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .    * the approximating space .",
    "* quasi - uniform grids . * the bernstein basis and univariate quasi - interpolant .",
    "* discretely blended bernstein - bzier quasi - interpolants .",
    "* order of approximation .",
    "* serendipity elements .",
    "* examples .",
    "in discrete polynomial blending , the approximating space is the algebraic sum of tensor product polynomial spaces .",
    "let @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] be sequences in @xmath5 , the space of @xmath6-tuples of non - negative integers .",
    "let @xmath7 be the tensor product of the spaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 of polynomials of degrees at most @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "then , we define our approximating spaces as @xmath12 we assume that both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are strictly increasing sequences , an assumption that we justify by the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath15 be defined as in ( [ e1 ] ) for some @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath5",
    ". there exists strictly increasing sequences @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath18 for some @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .    to begin , let @xmath21 and let @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "to prove this result , we will rearrange and truncate @xmath16 and @xmath17 until they are strictly increasing .",
    "suppose @xmath24 for some @xmath25 and @xmath26 . then either @xmath27 or @xmath28 . in the former case",
    ", @xmath29 can be removed from the representation in ( [ e1 ] ) without changing @xmath30 , and so we remove @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the sequences @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the latter case ,",
    "we remove @xmath35 and @xmath36 . after removing these unnecessary terms ,",
    "the terms left in the revised sequence @xmath33 are distinct .",
    "that is , @xmath37 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "further , since @xmath38 is not affected by the ordering of the tensor product terms , we can rearrange the pairs @xmath39 in @xmath40 so that @xmath16 is strictly increasing .",
    "thus , assume that @xmath16 is strictly increasing .",
    "now , if @xmath34 is not strictly increasing , then there exists an index @xmath25 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in which case @xmath43 , and so @xmath29 can be removed from the sum without changing @xmath30 . after trimming away all such terms in the sequence ,",
    "we are left with @xmath34 strictly increasing .",
    "hence , we are left with strictly increasing sequences @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath44 for some @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "further , since we are not adding new terms , @xmath19 .    a polynomial @xmath47 can be represented @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "each @xmath50 can be expressed @xmath51 for some coefficients @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the power basis for the space @xmath15 is the union @xmath53 however , this union is not disjoint .",
    "this basis can visualized by the dots in a _ lower grid _ , which is defined to be the graph of the _ lower set _",
    "\\times [ 0 , \\ldots , n_{r - k}].\\ ] ] the power basis for @xmath15 is therefore @xmath55 , and the dimension of @xmath15 is the number of dots in the lower grid . by counting the distinct dots in the lower grid , we arrive at the following :    [ prop0 ] the space @xmath15 is a vector space of dimension @xmath56 with @xmath57 .    in tbl .",
    "[ f1a ] , the dimension of the approximating space is given for a few choices of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in fig .",

    "in this paper we have constructed a new quasi - interpolant for discrete blended surface approximation based on dual basis functions in the bernstein basis , and we have established error estimates comparable to approximation on full tensor product grids , much like the serendipity elements in the finite element literature .    throughout this paper we assumed @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "if we do not have this , we can still apply our construction by first using degree elevation .",
    "for example , if @xmath64 $ ] we would degree elevation to get @xmath65 $ ] , and then proceed as before .",
    "the framework for this originates from the talk `` dual bases on subspaces and the approximation from sums of polynomial and spline spaces '' , given by the author at the conference `` mathematical methods for curves and surfaces '' , held in oslo norway , june , 2012 .",
    "the talk included constructions for hermite and spline blended elements similar to the construction in this paper .",
    "our plan is to publish the details of these results in forthcoming papers ."
