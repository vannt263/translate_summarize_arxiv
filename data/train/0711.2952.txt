    "eclipsing binary systems provide a good opportunity for studying the presence of an unresolved third body by observing their minima times because of the light - time effect ( hereafter lite ) .",
    "it was explained by irwin and its necessary criteria have been mentioned by frieboes - conde & hertzeg and also by mayer .",
    "presence of the third body in the system is possible only if the times of minima behave in agreement with a theoretical lite curve , the resultant mass function has reasonable value and corresponding variations in radial velocities are measured . in the last decade also",
    "a confirmation by astrometry seems to be plausible .    in each case",
    "we have calculated new light elements of the eclipsing pair and also the parameters of the predicted third body orbit .",
    "the tables i. and ii .",
    "present results for each system , where @xmath0 are masses of components , @xmath1 computed period of the unresolved body , @xmath2 semiamplitude of lite , @xmath3 eccentricity , @xmath4 length of periastron , @xmath5 mass function and @xmath6 minimum mass ( for @xmath7 = 90@xmath8 ) of predicted body , respectively .",
    "the subscript 3 and 4 denotes the parameter of the third and fourth body , respectively .",
    "we have derived new linear light elements : + oo aql : @xmath9 + v338 her : @xmath10 + t lmi : @xmath11 + rv lyr : @xmath12 + tw lac : @xmath13 + v396 mon : @xmath14 + in the case of oo aql and t lmi also the hypothesis of the fourth body was suggested .",
    "the results are in table ii . in the system",
    "oo  aql the components are very similar and also similar to the sun ( sp . g5v , t @xmath15 5700 k ) , so the second order variations could also be caused by the the magnetic cycles , similar to the sun ( so - called applegate mechanism , see eg .",
    "applegate ) .    in the system",
    "v338 her also the quadratic term was applied , so the mass transfer in the system could be present . from this hypothesis ( with mass transfer parameter @xmath16 )",
    "we have derived the mass transfer rate to @xmath17 .    in a few cases here",
    "the potential third body would be detectable in the detailed light curve analysis .",
    "especially the cases where the third body has not negligible mass , comparing with the eclipsing pair .",
    "regrettably we have no information about the distance of individual systems and also about the absolute magnitudes , so the determination of the angular separation of the possible third body is very uncertain .",

    "we have derived new lite parameters for six eclipsing binaries by means of an @xmath18 diagram analysis . in two cases ,",
    "oo aql and t  lmi , another variation was found , so there is a possibility of a presence of the fourth body in the system , or magnetic activity in them .",
    "but we have not enough data to make a final decision .",
    "so the consequence is , that for the confirmation of presence of the lite in these systems , we need detailed photometric , spectroscopic or astrometric data of these binaries .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services .",
    "this investigation was supported by the czech - greek project of collaboration rc-3 - 18 of ministry of education , youth and sport and by the grant agency of the czech republic , grant no ."

    "<S> the period changes of six eclipsing binaries have been studied with focus on the light - time effect . with the least squares method we also calculated parameters of such effect and properties of the unresolved body in these systems . with these results we discussed probability of presence of such bodies in the systems with respect to possible confirmation by another method . in two systems we also suggested a hypothesis of fourth body or magnetic activity for explanation of the `` second - order variability '' after subtraction of the light - time effect of the third body . </S>"
