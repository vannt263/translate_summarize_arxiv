    "in our previous papers [ 1 - 6 ] , a new quark meson coupling model bases on quark mass density- dependent(qmdd ) model is presented . the qmdd model suggested by fowler , raha and weiner [ 7 ] firstly assuming that the masses of u , d and s quarks(and the corresponding antiquarks ) satisfy : @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the baryon number density , @xmath6 is the current mass of the strange quark , and @xmath7 is the bag constant . as was explained in refs.[1 , 2 , 5 , 8 ] , the ansatz eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) corresponds to a quark confinement hypothesis because when @xmath8 and @xmath9 , it prevents the quark goes to infinity .",
    "it is shown that the properties of strange quark matter in the qmdd model are nearly the same as those obtained in the mit bag model [ 9 , 10 ] .",
    "but the basic difference is that instead of the mit bag boundary condition , we have the density- dependent masses of quarks in qmdd model according to eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "it means that the ansatz eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can replace mit bag boundary condition and get the nearly the same results .",
    "quark- meson coupling(qmc ) model suggested by guichon [ 11 ] firstly is a famous hybrid quark meson model which can describe many physical properties of nuclear matter and nuclei successfully [ 12 ] . in this model ,",
    "the nuclear system was suggested as a collection of mit bag and mesons .",
    "the interactions between quarks and mesons are limited within the mit bag regions . as was pointed in refs .",
    "[ 1 , 2 , 6 ] , this model has two major shortcomings : ( 1 ) it is a permanent quark confinement model because the mit bag boundary condition can not be destroyed by temperature and density .",
    "therefore , it can not describe the quark deconfinement phase transition .",
    "( 2 ) it is difficult to do nuclear many - body calculation beyond mean field approximation(mfa ) by means of qmc model , because we can not find the free propagators of quarks and mesons easily .",
    "the reason is that the interactions between quarks and mesons are limited within the bag regions , the multireflection of quarks and mesons by mit bag boundary must be taken into account for getting the free propagators .",
    "these two shortcomings come from mit bag constrain all .",
    "to overcome these two shortcomings , we suggested an improved quark mass density- dependent(qmdd ) model in refs .",
    "[ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "we added the @xmath0- meson and @xmath1- meson to improve the qmdd model . instead of the mit bag , after introducing the nonlinear interaction of @xmath0-mesons and qq@xmath0 coupling , we construct a friedberg- lee soliton bag in nuclear system .",
    "the quark masses are still density- dependent .",
    "the interactions between quarks and mesons are extended to the whole system .",
    "since the mit bag constraint is given up , our improved qmdd(iqmdd ) model can describe the quark deconfinement phase transition [ 6 ] and do the nuclear many- body calculations beyond mfa in principle .",
    "we have proved that our model can successfully describe the saturation properties , the equation of state , the compressibility and the effective nucleon mass of symmetric nuclear matter and give a reasonable critical temperature of quark deconfinement [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to extend our study to asymmetric nuclear matter , especially to the neutron matter and the neutron star .",
    "it means that we must consider the isosipn dependence and distinguish the u - quark and d - quark",
    ". we will add the isospin vector @xmath2 mesons to improve the iqmdd model in this paper .",
    "we hope to compare the results of iqmdd model with those obtained by qmc model and qhd - ii model for neutron matter and neutron star . in order to find their differences and similarity explicitly",
    ", we will use the same approximation as that of the qmc model [ 13 ] in our calculations .",
    "though the study of neutron star employing qmc model in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] is too simple , but in order to exhibit the basic differences between the iqmdd model and the qmc model , we still consider the neutron star by using the same approximation as ref . [ 14 ] .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the main formulas of the iqmdd model under the mean field approximation .",
    "the main formulas of neutron stars in also included . in the third section",
    ", some numerical results are presented .",
    "the last section contains a summary and discussions .",

    "the effective quark mass @xmath27 is given by : @xmath28 in nuclear matter , three quarks constitute a freidberg - lee soliton bag [ 15 ] , and the effective nucleon mass is obtained from the bag energy and reads : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the quark degeneracy , @xmath31 is fermi energy of quarks .",
    "@xmath32 is the density of states for various quarks in a spherical cavity .",
    "the expression of @xmath32 adopted in this paper con be found in ref . [ 16 ] .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath31 of quarks is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 the bag radius @xmath36 is determined by the equilibrium condition for the nucleon bag : @xmath37    in nuclear matter , the total energy density and pressure density read @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is degeneracy of proton or neutron , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is fermi momenta of proton and neutron , and @xmath43 is the difference between the proton and neutron densities , respectively . therefore @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the density of proton and neutron respectively , and the density of nuclear matter @xmath47 resds @xmath48    in eqs .",

    "this is a general character for adding a nonlinear scalar @xmath0 field and using mfa to a physical model [ 17 ] . but as was pointed in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , we can prove that one of these solutions corresponds to unstable and unphysical branch , and the other corresponds a stable soliton solution .",
    "hereafter we give up the unphysical solution and consider the physical solution only .",
    "we note that the expression for the total energy density , eq .",
    "( 13 ) , is very similar to that of qhd - ii model and qmc model .",
    "the differences comes from the effective nucleon mass eqs .",

    "the curves of @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be shown in sec .",
    "we now turn to investigate the neutron matter and neutron star for the iqmdd model .",
    "since the aim of this paper is to compare the iqmdd model and the qmc model , we use the same approximation to study the neutron star as that of the qmc model [ 14 ] .",
    "more detail treatment of neutron star such as the phase transition for the quark matter and the neutron matter , the contribution of hyperon and etc , has been neglected .",
    "two basic assumptions : the neutron star matter is charge neutrality and reaches to the @xmath65-equilibrium , are adopted [ 14 ] . since we assume that the nucleons and light leptons exist in the neutron star only , charge neutrality is expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number density of particle @xmath68 . under @xmath65-equilibrium",
    ", the processes @xmath69 occur at the same rate",
    ". this condition can be satisfied when the chemical potentials before and after the decay are same .",

    "( 29 ) , ( 30 ) and ( 9 ) , we can study the physical behavior of neutron star for iqmdd model .",

    "obviously , the behaviors at the saturation point must be explained for a successful model .",
    "it reveals that nuclear matter saturates at a density @xmath84 @xmath83 with a binding energy per particle @xmath85 mev at zero temperature , and the compression constant to be about @xmath86 mev .",
