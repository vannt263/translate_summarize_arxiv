    "since the discovery of the first pulsar in 1968 @xcite and its identification as a rotating neutron star , the structure , composition , dynamics and evolution of these astrophysical objects became important themes of theoretical and phenomenological research . according to an early suggestion @xcite , neutron stars evolve from an initially hot protoneutron star that forms in the collapse of a massive star in the supernova phenomenon . at densities exceeding that of nuclear matter",
    ", important static properties of a neutron star as the mass - radius relation , the crust extent , the distribution of the stellar moments of inertia and the central density , may be determined by its equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .    during this period ,",
    "there has been a continuous enhancement concerning relativistic microscopic calculations of the eos of neutron stars , improving our understanding of the structure of these stellar objects .",
    "in particular , any theory must at least account for a neutron star as massive as the most massive observed pulsar ; the knowledge of pulsar masses provides a very important constraint on the theory .",
    "more recent calculations based on relativistic properties of nuclear matter at high densities indicate that the equations of state are considerable stiffer than those predicted by non - relativistic approaches . as a result",
    ", the mass of a neutron star is believed to be at least as large as @xmath1 .    from the theoretical point of view , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) represents the most profound description of the strong interaction and would be the ideal tool for neutron star applications .",
    "however , the highly non - linear behavior of qcd at the hadronic energy scales inhibits any practical calculations leading most theorists to search for phenomenological descriptions of the structure of nuclear matter .",
    "one of these alternative approachs is quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , a relativistic quantum field theory based on a local lagrangian density which uses baryon and meson fields as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this model provides consistent theoretical framework for describing such a relativistic interacting many - body system and , based on it , glendenning presented @xcite a very comprehensive treatment of the matter in neutron stars using an extended version which included leptons and the fundamental baryonic octet .",
    "alternative versions of the walecka model , namely the boguta - bodmer ( bb ) @xcite and the zimanyi - moszkowski ( zm ) models @xcite , were developed to improve the description of the nucleon effective mass , @xmath2 , ( too low ) and compression modulus of nuclear matter , @xmath3 , ( too high ) as attained with the original approach .",
    "boguta and bodmer introduced cubic and quartic scalar self - interactions in the lagrangian while the zm models have heightened the delineation of these quantities by replacing the yukawa scalar coupling term by a _ derivative coupling _ contribution .",
    "this derivative coupling may be interpreted alternatively as a phenomenological coupling between the scalar neutral meson and the nucleon fields through the introduction of a baryon density dependence in the scalar , vector and isovector coupling constants of the theory @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the structure of neutron stars by introducing a qhd lagrangian with a parameterized meson coupling contribution @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological approach contains high order self - coupling contributions of the meson fields and permits in particular to restore the results obtained with walecka , zm and zm3 models by making suitable choices of the values of the mathematical parameters of the theory .",
    "the control on the analytical form of the couplings allows us to investigate other values of these parameters which give new physical results . by extending the formalism to include hyperons and leptons ,",
    "we investigate several static bulk properties of neutron stars using the walecka , zm and zm3 models , the two later being applied to this problem for the first time . as we have a class of models we are able to relate nuclear matter and neutron star properties .",
    "in particular , we have found that some of the studied models describe very strong scalar fields in the interior of the neutron stars , leading to a negative nucleon effective mass .",
    "according to glendenning in @xcite , _ la raison dtre _ of neutron stars is to be neutral . to prove this assertive , one should consider that neutron stars are held together by the gravitational attraction and take into account the balance between the repulsive coulomb force acting on a charged particle of the same sign as the net charge of the star ( @xmath4 ) and the gravitational force .",
    "assuming the particle to be located at the surface of the star , it will be expelled out unless the gravitational force overcomes the coulomb force . for the proton , the corresponding limit on the net positive charge of",
    "the star is @xmath5 @xcite . for the electron",
    ", this limit would be reduced by the factor @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the net charge per charged particle is practically zero .",
    "this result leads to the conclusion that a neutron star is electrically neutral .      in the evolution of the protoneutron star",
    "many different reactions can occur . electric charge and baryon number",
    "are conserved on a long time - scale in comparison to the lifetime of the star . in the core of the protoneutron star ,",
    "the fermi energy of the nucleons exceed the hyperon masses and these particles can be produced in strong interaction processes with conservation of strangeness in reactions such that @xmath7 however , strangeness is not conserved in the time - scale of the star since there occurs diffusion of neutrinos and photons to the surface of the star and processes like @xmath8 can not be reversed anymore and a net strangeness appears .    in this evolution process ,",
    "the star reaches the chemical equilibrium , a degenerate state where , from the point of view of its hadronic and leptonic composition , further reactions are not possible . as an example , in an ideal degenerate system of protons , neutrons and electrons at chemical equilibrium , particle levels are filled in such a way that neutron beta decay or proton inverse beta decay are not energetically favored .",
    "in general , if one takes into account the fundamental baryon octet and lepton degrees of freedom ( electrons and muons ) , the following chemical equilibrium equation then holds ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 ; @xmath11 represents the baryon number and @xmath12 the electric charge of species @xmath13 . in this way ,",
    "the conditions for @xmath14 equilibrium can be summarized as @xmath15",
    "in this section we study baryon and lepton populations in neutron stars by using the boguta - bodmer model ( bb ) with hyperon degrees of freedom . in spite of this study",
    "having been already done @xcite , we reproduce its main results as a guide for the development in the next section of our new class of non - linear relativistic models .    the bb model describes the complex fermionic composition of neutron stars as a generalization of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 theory @xmath19 \\psi_b \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ ! \\",

    "in the numerical calculations with the bb model we have considered matter with and without hyperons , in order to understand how these strange species affect the neutron star properties .",
    "figure [ 3ipop1 ] , panels _ a - d _ , shows baryon and lepton populations and field strengths as a function of the total baryon density for two different ratios : @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( universal coupling ) . from expression ( [ nlpot ] ) for the baryon chemical potential we can see that the charge term in the eigenvalue determines whether a species is charge - favored or unfavored ; and the isospin term determines whether a species is isospin - favored or not .",
    "baryons with the same sign of the electric charge as the proton are unfavored ; baryons with the same sign of its isospin projection are favored ( notice that @xmath62 ) .    at high densities ( @xmath63 )",
    "the @xmath23 hyperon becomes the most populous species for the case @xmath60 ( panel _ a _ ) . at panel _",
    "b _ we see that the electron chemical potential reaches a maximum value at @xmath64 and begins to decrease due to the reduction of the electron population . at @xmath65",
    "the nucleon effective mass is still at @xmath66 .    in the panel _",
    "c _ of the same figure , we see that , to the increasing of the meson - hyperon coupling constant ( from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) it corresponds an early emergency of the particles . in the comparison with the results of panel _ a _",
    ", we can see that the leptons have a greater population in this case and that the neutron population remains always as the most important in the system .",
    "the electron chemical potential and @xmath69 saturates around @xmath70 at panel _",
    "d _ and the nucleon effective mass behaves similarly to the case @xmath60 .      in the sequence of the analysis of the results of figure [ 3ipop1 ] , panel _ e _ shows baryon and lepton populations and the corresponding chemical potentials when we exclude hyperon degrees of freedom . in this case , since charge neutrality is kept only by the @xmath71 and @xmath72 particles , the lepton population increases in the domain of densities shown in the figure . also , we notice the increasing of the nucleon effective mass , which means a less intense scalar field when compared to the previous cases .",
    "this indicates that the _ introduction of hyperons enhance the scalar meson condensation_.      we are able now to find numerical results for the eos using equations ( [ 3nldener ] ) and ( [ 3nlpressao ] ) .",

    "we can see that the energy density is approximately constant for heavier stars and is found mostly around @xmath80 .",
    "the conversion of nucleons into hyperons reduces the fermi pressure associated to the baryons , softening the equation of state and lowering , as a consequence , the maximum mass of a neutron star sequence . in figure [ starnl].b",

    "this result indicates that the predictions of neutron star masses based mainly on the compression modulus are more model independent than those based on the nucleon effective mass .    from figure [ fig3 ] and table [ 4tabstev ]",
    ", we see that for @xmath194 in the s - v case , we have obtained negative values for the nucleon effective mass , which corresponds to a density region for which the strength of the scalar condensate exceeds the free mass of the nucleon , @xmath195 .",

    "let us introduce the scalar field equation in ( [ eq : efma ] ) , for the walecka case , to get a better understanding of the problem ; we obtain @xmath199 or @xmath200 as we add more and more baryonic species , the negative term in the numerator of ( [ effect ] ) becomes more important and we open the possibility for the scalar potential @xmath190 to become greater than the free baryon masses .",
    "in fact , even if we had just considered nucleons , but taking into account the difference in the neutron and proton masses , that negative term in the numerator would appear .",
    "however , since this difference is very tiny , a negative effective mass would emerge in practice only with the addition of hyperon degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we could interpret the vanishing of the effective mass as a signal of a transition to a quark - gluon plasma phase .",
    "however , we should remember that our lagrangian model does not comprehend these underlying degrees of freedom . additionally , as pointed out in @xcite , at such high densities and strong meson fields we have already reached the critical density where the production of baryon - antibaryon pairs is favored . in fact , this behavior of the effective mass may indicate that the mean field approximation is reaching the limits of its applicability .    concerning the problem of negative effective mass , we want to clarify a point which may appear naive but has led to misunderstandings .",
    "the integrals appearing in the rmf formalism always present a term @xmath201 and , in this way , are symmetric with respect to positive or negative values of the effective mass .",
    "for example , let us take the integral related to the scalar density : @xmath202 rigorously , the expression for @xmath203 would involve the modulus of @xmath204 since @xmath205 : @xmath206 some authors have assumed _ ad hoc _ the modulus of @xmath2 in the above logarithm when the problem of negative values appears .",

    "we have done an analysis on the influence of nuclear matter properties on the structure of neutron stars using a new class of rmf models with parameterized couplings among mesons and baryons .",
    "these couplings allow to reproduce , trough a suitable choice of mathematical parameters ( @xmath210 ) , results of the walecka and derivative coupling models such as zm and zm3 models . as we have shown above",
