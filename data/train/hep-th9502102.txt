    "in a previous paper@xcite , we investigated the massive schwinger model@xcite with @xmath0 in the light - front tamm - dancoff ( lftd ) approximation@xcite up to including four - body states .",
    "we showed , by examining the wave functions , that the lightest isosinglet state can be regarded as a bound state of two `` pions . ''",
    "this observation naturally led us to the answer to the question raised by coleman@xcite why it is so light .",
    "the lftd approximation has been proved to be one of the most powerful non - perturbative methods to date in the investigation of relativistic bound states , at least in two dimensions , although we have to face the difficult renormalization problem in higher dimensions .",
    "the validity of the lftd approximation is based on the plausible hope that the sea quark / gluon contributions are small in the light - cone quantization because pair creations / annihilations are suppressed@xcite .",
    "typically , the lightest particles are expected to be in the valence states .",
    "it is generally true in the models so far investigated .",
    "the above mentioned state ( the bound state of two `` pions '' ) is an important exception . with this exception",
    ", one might think that such a state would have non - negligible many - body components too .",
    "it is one of our purposes of this paper to show numerically that it is unlikely by examining the single - flavor model .",
    "we also investigate the three - meson bound state of the single - flavor model .",
    "its existence has been discussed by coleman@xcite by using the bosonization technique .",
    "he showed that , in the strong coupling limit with the zero vacuum angle , there exists a stable three - meson bound state and it is unstable when the vacuum angle is non - zero .",
    "we look for a candidate which can be interpreted as a bound state of three mesons in our numerical results .    in order to investigate these problems ,",
    "it is necessary to do lftd calculations up to including six - body states .",
    "such calculations are very hard without any technical refinement . to make these calculations feasible",
    "we have made two points : ( 1 ) we take a simple set of basis functions in order to reduce cpu time .",
    "a clever choice of basis functions is essential as in quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "note that our choice of basis functions in a finite domain will be also useful for higher dimensions . even in higher dimensions",
    "the longitudinal momenta @xmath1 of constituents are restricted to a finite domain @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total momentum .",
    "( 2 ) the three - meson bound state , if it exists , must be in the continuum unless it is lighter than two mesons , and is therefore apparently difficult to find .",
    "we can however find a candidate among several states by looking at the wave functions .",
    "the points are that a three - meson state must be charge conjugation odd and that below the three - meson threshold , six - body components should be very small except for three - meson bound states .",

    "although the concept of `` relative motion '' of a relativistic bound state is somewhat awkward , we however find that the two - meson bound state is well described in terms of the wave function of the relative motion , in the sense that a smaller set of basis functions motivated by the concept of the relative motion gives a good approximation .",
    "it gives us a qualitative picture of the bound state .",
    "we summarize the results : ( 1 ) the masses of the lowest states do not change even if we include six - body states .",
    "( 2 ) in particular , the state which can be regarded as a bound state of two mesons has a negligible six - body component .",
    "( 3 ) we find a candidate for the bound state of three mesons .",
    "( 4 ) the wave function of the relative motion of the two - meson bound state describes the bound state well .",
    "we can have a picture that in the strong coupling region it is loosely bound , while in the weak coupling region it is tightly bound , compare to the size of the meson .",

    "the mass is @xmath84 at @xmath85 which should be compared to @xmath86 in the four - body calculations .",

    "( 3 ) it must be charge conjugation odd .",
    "the first criterion is a trivial one , and is necessary for distinguishing it from three - meson scattering states .",

    "thus a three - meson state may be represented as @xmath97 , which implies that the three - meson bound state has a large six - body component and negligibly small many - body components .",
    "similarly a two - meson state has a negligibly small six - body component .",

    "it is charge conjugation odd .",
    "one might be surprised that it has a small six - body component , and might suspect that it is a two - meson state . in sec .",

    "it is an outstanding feature that we can get such information . in this section ,",
    "we consider another example in which the information of the wave function is crucial .",
    "we introduce a meson creation operator to have a qualitative picture of the two - meson bound state by considering the wave function of the relative motion .",

    "( 1 ) in the massless theory , there exists only a free scalar particle in the physical spectrum .",
    "but because the creation operator of the meson , if expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the fermion and the antifermion as in ( [ masslessmeson ] ) , contains the annihilation operators , even a pure ( free ) three - meson state is not a pure six - body state .",

    "the two- and three - meson bound states appear above the threshold .",
    "we have the prejudice that despite our numerical results , they are , in reality , still bound .",
