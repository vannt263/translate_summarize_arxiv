    "-5 mm    during the twentieth century chain complexes , their exactness properties , and commutative diagrams involving them pervaded many branches of mathematics , most notably algebraic topology and differential geometry .",
    "recently such homological techniques have come to play an important role in a branch of mathematics often thought quite distant from these , numerical analysis .",
    "their most significant applications have been to the design and analysis of numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations .",
    "let us consider a general problem , such as a boundary value problem in partial differential equations , as an operator equation : given data @xmath0 in some space @xmath1 find the solution @xmath2 in some space @xmath3 to the problem @xmath4 .",
    "a numerical method discretizes this problem through the construction of an operator @xmath5 and data @xmath6 and defines an approximate solution @xmath7 by the equation @xmath8 .",
    "of course the numerical method is not likely to be of value unless it is consistent which means that @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be close to @xmath11 and @xmath0 in an appropriate sense .",
    "before we speak of solving the original problem , numerically or otherwise , we should first confront the question of whether it is well - posed .",
    "that is , given @xmath12 , does a unique @xmath13 exist , and , if so , do small changes of @xmath0 induce small changes in @xmath1 ? the analogous questions for the numerical method , whether given @xmath6 a unique @xmath7 is determined by the discrete equation @xmath8 , and whether small changes in @xmath10 induce small changes in @xmath14 , is the question of _ stability _ of the numerical method .",
    "a common paradigm , which can be formalized in many contexts of numerical analysis , is that a method which is consistent and stable is convergent .",
    "well - posedness is a central issue in the theory of partial differential equations .",
    "of course , we do not expect just any pde problem to be well - posed .",
    "well - posedness hinges on structure of the problem which may be elusive or delicate .",
    "superficially small changes , for example to the sign of a coefficient or the type of boundary conditions , can certainly destroy well - posedness .",
    "the same is true for the stability of numerical methods : it often depends on subtle or elusive properties of the numerical scheme .",
    "usually stability reflects some portion of the structure of the original problem that is captured by the numerical scheme .",
    "however in many contexts it is not enough that the numerical scheme be close to the original problem in a quantitative sense for it to inherit stability .",
    "that is , it may well happen that a consistent method for a well - posed problem is unstable . in this paper",
    "we shall see several examples where the exactness properties of discrete differential complexes and their relation to differential complexes associated with the pde are crucial tools in establishing the stability of numerical methods . in some cases",
    "the homological arguments have served to elucidate or validate methods that had been developed over the preceding decades . in others",
    "they have pointed the way to stable discretizations of problems for which none were previously known .",
    "they will very likely play a similar role in the eventual solution of some formidable open problems in numerical pde , especially for problems with significant geometric content , such as in numerical general relativity . as in other branches of mathematics , in numerical analysis differential complexes serve both to encode key structure concisely and to unify considerations from seemingly very different contexts .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss only finite element methods since , of the major classes of numerical methods for pde , they are the most amenable to rigorous analysis , and have seen the greatest use of differential complexes . but complexes have recently arisen in the study of finite differences , finite volumes , and spectral methods as well .",
    "-5 mm    a finite element space on a domain @xmath15 is a function space defined piecewise by a certain assembly procedure which we now recall ; cf .  @xcite . for simplicity , here we shall restrict to spaces of piecewise polynomials with respect to a triangulation of an @xmath16-dimensional domain by @xmath16-simplices with @xmath17 or @xmath18 ( so implicitly we are assuming that @xmath19 is polygonal or @xmath20 is polyhedral ) . on each simplex",
    "@xmath21 we require that there be given a function space of _ shape function _ @xmath22 and a set of _ degrees of freedom _ , i.e. , a set of linear functionals on @xmath22 which form a basis for the dual space .",
    "moreover , each degree of freedom is supposed to be associated with some subsimplex of some dimension , i.e. , in three dimensions with a vertex , an edge , a face , or the tetrahedron itself . for a subsimplex which is shared by two simplices in the triangulation , we assume that the corresponding functionals are in one - to - one - correspondence",
    ". then the finite element space @xmath23 is defined as those functions on @xmath15 whose restriction to each simplex @xmath21 of the triangulation belongs to @xmath22 and for which the corresponding degrees of freedom agree whenever a subsimplex is shared by two simplices .",
    "the simplest example is obtained by choosing @xmath22 to be the constant functions and taking as the only degree of freedom on @xmath21 the @xmath24th order moment @xmath25 ( which we associate with @xmath21 itself ) .",
    "the resulting finite element space is simply the space of piecewise constant functions with respect to the given triangulation .",
    "similarly we could choose @xmath26 ( by @xmath27 we denote the space of polynomial functions on @xmath21 of degree at most @xmath28 ) , and take as degrees of freedom the moments of degrees @xmath24 and also those of degree @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "again all the degrees of freedom are associated to @xmath21 itself .",
    "this time the finite element space consists of all piecewise linear functions . of course",
    ", the construction extends to higher degrees .    a more common piecewise linear finite element space occurs if we again choose @xmath26 , but take as degrees of freedom the maps @xmath31 , one associated to each vertex @xmath32 .",
    "in this case the assembled finite element space consists of all _ continuous _ piecewise linear functions .",
    "more generally we can choose @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and associate to each vertex the evaluation degrees of freedom just mentioned , to each edge the moments on the edge of degree at most @xmath35 , to each face the moments on the face of degree at most @xmath36 , and to each tetrahedron the moments of degree at most @xmath37 .",

    "-.16in-.20in-.01in-.0 in    the choice of the shape functions and the degrees of freedom determine the smoothness of the functions belonging to the assembled finite element space .",
    "for example , the lagrange finite element spaces of any degree belong to the sobolev space @xmath57 of @xmath58 functions whose distributial first partial derivatives also belong to @xmath58 ( and even to @xmath59 ) .",
    "in fact , the distributional first partial derivative of a continuous piecewise smooth function coincides with its derivative taken piecewise and so belongs to @xmath60 .",
    "thus the degrees of freedom we imposed in constructing the lagrange finite elements are sufficient to insure that the assembled finite element space @xmath61 .",
    "in fact more is true : for the lagrange finite element space with shape function spaces @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 this says that , in a sense , the degrees of freedom impose exactly the continuity required to belong to @xmath64 , no less and no more .",
    "in contrast , the discontinuous piecewise polynomial spaces are subsets of @xmath58 but not of @xmath57 , since their distributional first derivatives involve distributions supported on the interelement boundaries , and so do not belong to @xmath58 .    for the vector - valued finite elements there are more possibilities .",
    "the face and edge spaces contain discontinuous functions , and so are not contained in @xmath65 .",
    "however , for vector fields belonging to one of the face spaces the normal component of the vector field does not jump across interelement boundaries , and this implies , via integration by parts , that the distributional divergence of the function coincides with the divergence taken piecewise .",
    "thus the face spaces belong to @xmath66 , the space of @xmath60 vector fields on @xmath15 whose divergence belongs to @xmath60 . indeed ,",
    "for these spaces the degrees of freedom impose exactly the continuity of @xmath67 , no less or more .",
    "for the edge spaces it can be shown that the tangential components of a vector field do not jump across element boundaries , and this implies that the edge functions belong to @xmath68 , the space of @xmath60 vector fields whose curl belongs to @xmath60 .",
    "again the degrees of freedom impose exactly the continuity needed for inclusion in @xmath69 .",
    "-5 mm    the de  rham complex @xmath70 is defined for an arbitrary smooth @xmath16-manifold @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath71 denotes the space of differential @xmath72-forms on @xmath15 , i.e. , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 is an alternating @xmath72-linear map on the tangent space @xmath76 .",
    "the operators @xmath77 denote exterior differentiation .",
    "this is is a complex in that the composition of two exterior differentiations always vanishes .",
    "moreover , and if the manifold is topologically trivial , then it is exact .",
    "if @xmath15 is a domain in @xmath78 , then we may identify its tangent space at any point with @xmath78 . using the euclidean inner product ,",
    "the space of linear maps on @xmath78 may be identified by @xmath78 as usual , so @xmath79 may be identified with the space @xmath80 of smooth vector fields on @xmath15 . moreover , the space of alternating bilinear maps on @xmath78 may be identified with @xmath78 by associating to a vector @xmath2 the alternating bilinear map @xmath81 .",
    "thus we have an identification of @xmath82 with @xmath78 as well .",
    "finally the only alternating trilinear maps on @xmath78 are given by multiples of the determinant map @xmath83 , and so we may identify @xmath84 with @xmath85 . in terms of such _ proxy fields",
    "_ , the de  rham complex becomes @xmath86 alternatively we may consider @xmath60-based forms and the sequence becomes @xmath87    the finite element spaces constructed above allow us to form discrete analogues of the de  rham complex .",
    "given some triangulation of @xmath20 , let @xmath23 denote the space of continuous piecewise linear finite elements , @xmath88 the lowest order edge element space , @xmath89 the lowest order face element space , and @xmath90 the space of piecewise constants . then @xmath91 ( since @xmath88 contains all piecewise constant vector fields belonging to @xmath69 and the gradient of a continuous piecewise linear is certainly such a function ) , @xmath92 ( since @xmath89 contains all piecewise constant vector fields belonging to @xmath69 ) , and @xmath93 .",
    "thus we have the discrete differential complex @xmath94 this differential complex captures the topology of the domain to the same extent as the de  rham complex .",
    "in particular , if the domain is topologically trivial , then the sequence is exact .",

    "there is another important relationship between the de  rham complex and the discrete complex .",
    "the defining degrees of freedom determine projections @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and so on .",
    "in fact @xmath98 is just the usual interpolant , @xmath99 is the @xmath60-projection into the piecewise constants , and the projections @xmath100 and @xmath101 onto the edge and face elements are determined by the maintenance of the appropriate moments",
    ". it can be checked , based on stokes theorem , that the following diagram commutes . @xmath102",
    "the finite element spaces appearing in this diagram , with one degree of freedom for each vertex for @xmath23 , for each edge for @xmath88 , for each face for @xmath89 , and for each simplex for @xmath90 , are highly geometrical .",
    "in fact , recalling the identifications between fields and differential forms , we may view these spaces as spaces of piecewise smooth differential forms .",
    "they were in fact first constructed in this context , without any thought of finite elements or numerical methods , by whitney @xcite .",
    "the spaces were reinvented , one - by - one , as finite element spaces in response to the needs of various numerical problems , and the properties which are summarized in the commutative diagram above were slowly rediscovered as needed to analyze the resulting numerical methods .",
    "the connection between low order edge and face finite elements and whitney forms was first realized by bossavit @xcite .",
    "analogous statements hold for higher order lagrange , edge , face , and discontinuous finite elements .",
    "for example , the following diagram commutes and has exact rows : @xmath103{000213.eps } } @>{\\operatorname{grad } } > >    \\raise-.15in\\hbox{\\includegraphics[width=.5in]{000224.eps } } @>{\\operatorname{curl } } > >    \\raise-.25in\\hbox{\\includegraphics[width=.5in]{000222.eps } } @>{\\operatorname{div } } > >    \\raise-.15in\\hbox{\\includegraphics[width=.5in]{000210.eps } } @.\\to 0 \\end{cd}\\ ] ]    we shall see many other discrete differential complexes below .",

    "many of the partial differential equations of mathematical physics admit similar interpretations in terms of differential forms . for a discussion of this in the context of discretization , see @xcite .    a natural approach to discretization of the mixed variational principle",
    "is to choose subspaces @xmath182 , @xmath183 and seek a critical point @xmath184 .",
    "this is of course equivalent to a galerkin method and leads to a system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "however in this case , _ stability is not automatic_. it can happen that the discrete system is singular , or more commonly , that the norm of the discrete solution operator grows unboundedly as the mesh is refined .    in a fundamental paper , brezzi @xcite established two conditions that together are sufficient ( and essentially necessary ) for stability .",

    "( in practice , this is nearly the only way it is satisfied . )",
    "this certainly holds if @xmath93 , and so such as inclusion is a common design principle of mixed finite element spaces .",
    "on the other hand , condition ( s2 ) is most easily satisfied if @xmath199 , because in this case , given @xmath189 , we can choose @xmath187 with @xmath200 , so @xmath201 , and the second condition will be satisfied as long as we can insure that @xmath202 . in short , we need to know that @xmath203 maps @xmath89 onto @xmath90 and that @xmath204 admits a bounded one - sided inverse .",
    "the face elements of raviart - thomas and nedelec were designed to satisfy both these conditions .",

    "of course , the same argument shows the stability of a mixed method based on higher order face elements as well .",
    "thus we see that the stability of the mixed finite element method depends on the properties of the spaces @xmath90 and @xmath89 encoded in the rightmost square of the commutative diagram .",
    "now let us return to the resonant cavity eigenvalue problem for which we explored the galerkin method : find @xmath134 , @xmath213 such that @xmath214 we saw that if @xmath215 is taken to be a space of edge elements this method gives good results in that the positive eigenvalues of the discrete problem are good approximations for the positive eigenvalues of the continuous problem .",
    "however , the simple choice of lagrange finite elements did not give good results .",
    "we now explain the good performance of the edge elements based on the middle square of the commutative diagram .",
    "following boffi et .",
    "al @xcite we set @xmath216 and introduce the following mixed discrete eigenvalue problem : find @xmath134 , @xmath217 such that @xmath218 it is then easy to verify that if @xmath130 , @xmath219 is a solution to with @xmath220 , then @xmath130 , @xmath221 is a solution to , and if @xmath130 , @xmath222 is a solution to then @xmath220 and @xmath130 , @xmath219 is a solution to . in short , the two problems are equivalent except that the former admits a zero eigenspace which the mixed formulation suppresses .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the accuracy of the mixed eigenvalue problem hinges on the stability of the corresponding mixed source problem .",
    "this is a saddle - point problem of the sort studied by brezzi , and so stability depends on conditions analogous to ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) .",
    "the proof of these conditions in case @xmath88 is the space of edge elements follows , as in the preceding stability verification , from surjectivity and commutativity properties encoded in the diagram .",
    "the diagram can also be used to explain the zero eigenspace computed with edge elements . recall that in the case of the mesh shown in figure  [ fg : nodeig ] , this space had dimension @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , this eigenspace is simply the null space of the curl operator restricted to @xmath88 . referring again to the commutative diagram , this is the gradient of the space @xmath23 of linear lagrange elements vanishing on the boundary .",
    "its dimension is therefore exactly the number of interior nodes of the mesh .",
    "-5 mm    let @xmath223 denote the space of @xmath224 symmetric matrices . given a volumetric loading density @xmath225 , the system of linearized elasticity determines the displacement field @xmath226 and the stress field @xmath227 induced in the elastic domain @xmath15 by the equations @xmath228 together with boundary conditions such as @xmath229 on @xmath108 . here",

    ", we need to specify finite element subspaces @xmath234 and @xmath235 and restrict the domain of the variational problem .",
    "of course the spaces must be carefully designed if the mixed method is to be stable : the analogues of the stability conditions ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) must be satisfied .",
    "the functional is quite similar in appearance to and so it might be expected that the mixed finite elements developed for the latter ( the face elements for @xmath178 and discontinuous elements for @xmath2 ) could be adapted to the case of elasticity .",
    "in fact , the requirement of symmetry of the stress tensor and , correspondingly , the replacement of the gradient by the symmetric gradient , changes the structure significantly .",
    "four decades of searching for mixed finite elements for elasticity beginning in the 1960s did not yield any stable elements with polynomial shape functions .    using discrete differential complexes ,",
    "r.  winther and the author recently developed the first such elements for elasticity problems in two dimensions @xcite .",

    "the finite elements we introduced in @xcite , for which the element diagrams can be seen in figure  [ fg : aw ] , use discontinuous piecewise linear vector fields for the displacement field and a piecewise polynomial space which we shall now describe for the stress field .",
