    "with an orbital period of only 11.4 minutes , 4u 1820 - 30 is the most compact low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) known ( stella et al .",
    "thermonuclear x - ray bursts were discovered from this source by grindlay & gursky ( 1976 ) and attest that the primary is a neutron star . using vela",
    "5b data priedhorsky & terrell ( 1984 ) found a 176 day periodic modulation of the x - ray flux from 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "bursts have only been observed when the accretion driven flux is near the low end of its observed range , @xmath12 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath2",
    ". mass transfer in this system can be driven by gravitational radiation at the rate of @xmath13  g  s@xmath2 .",
    "the binary resides in the globular cluster ngc 6624 .",
    "optical observations give a distance estimate of 7.6 kpc ( hesser & shawl 1985 ; rich , minniti , & liebert 1993 ) .",
    "based on the peak flux of photospheric radius expansion x - ray bursts , vacca , lewin , & van paradijs ( 1986 ) estimated a likely distance of @xmath14 kpc .",
    "the compact nature of the system requires that the secondary be a low mass helium dwarf ( see rappaport et al .",
    "1987 ) , so that the accreted material likely has a very high helium abundance .",
    "the observation of photospheric radius expansion bursts is consistent with the idea that helium flashes are the primary fuel for the 1020  s duration bursts most commonly observed .",
    "modulations of the uv flux from 4u 1820 - 30 at the 11.4 minute orbital period were predicted by arons & king ( 1993 ) and subsequently discovered by anderson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . the uv modulations result from x - ray heating of the secondary and constrain the system inclination @xmath15 to the range @xmath16 .",
    "smale et al . ( 1997 ) reported the discovery of kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) from 4u 1820 - 30 . since then further observations have revealed that the highest observed khz qpo appear to reach a saturation frequency near 1,050 hz , suggesting the presence of a last stable circular orbit as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) ( zhang , strohmayer & swank 1998 ; kaaret , ford & chen 1998 ) .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct it also suggests that the neutron star in 4u 1820 - 30 may be as massive as @xmath17 ( see also arons & king 1993 ) .",
    "constraints derived from the study of x - ray bursts can provide information on the neutron star mass and radius and thus might also provide a key test of these conclusions .",
    "recently , cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported the detection of a very long ( @xmath18 hr ) burst from 4u 1735 - 44 with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on _ bepposax_. spectral softening in this burst led the authors to conclude that it was thermonuclear in origin .",
    "there have been other recent reports of very long thermonuclear bursts from lmxbs , for example , heise , in t zand & kuulkers ( 2000 ) report long bursts from ks 1731 - 260 and serpens x-1 , and kuulkers ( 2001 ) recently identified a likely super burst from gx 3 + 1 in rxte / asm data . as part of a rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte )",
    "ao3 observing program to try and detect x - ray bursts as well as study khz qpo from 4u 1820 - 30 , rxte was observing the source on september 9 , 1999 ut when a long , powerful x - ray burst was observed .",
    "this burst was @xmath19 times longer than the more frequent thermonuclear bursts seen from the source ( see for example haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) . in this paper , we show that this super burst was thermonuclear in origin and that it was most likely fueled by burning of carbon ashes produced by the stable burning of helium accreted onto the neutron star in 4u 1820 - 30 . in this respect ,",
    "4u  1820 - 30 differs from the other five super burst sources , which accrete a hydrogen / helium mixture and therefore produce much less carbon ( see cumming & bildsten 2001 ) .",
    "a consequence of this is that the recurrence time for this source will be of the order of a decade , however , unless the carbon ignition is somehow `` triggered . ''",
    "a very brief summary of the analysis in this paper was previously presented by strohmayer ( 2000 ) .",
    "we also note that during the preparation of this paper a burst lasting several hours was observed during rxte observations of 4u 1636 - 53 in support of rxte proposal 50030 ( pi : strohmayer ) .",
    "an analysis of this burst will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the 4u 1636 - 53 event was independently found with the asm by wijnands ( 2001 ) , who also found a similar event in the asm archive which occurred @xmath20 years earlier .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the observed temporal and spectral characteristics as well as the energetics of the super burst . in   3 we discuss the implications of the discrete spectral components ( line and edge ) observed during the burst .",
    "section  4 begins with a discussion of the production of carbon and the thermal structure of the `` ocean . ''",
    "we assess the amount of carbon needed to produce a thermonuclear runaway and the evolution of the ensuing burst .",
    "we conclude in   5 with a summary of our principal findings .",
    "as mentioned above , 4u 1820 - 30 has a @xmath21 day x - ray intensity modulation ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) . the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board rxte has been monitoring the source for more than 5 years .",
    "figure 1 shows a portion of the 212 kev asm lightcurve of 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "the dips down into the lowest flux state occur approximately at the 178 day period .",
    "our rxte observations on mjd 51430 ( sep .  9 ,",
    "1999 utc , indicated by the vertical arrow in the figure ) caught the source near its low flux state when bursts can be observed .    in the weeks prior to our observation rxte had a malfunction in one of its antenna transponders which disabled one of the high - gain antennas with which rxte telemeters data to the ground . because of this antenna malfunction some data from our observation were unfortunately lost . for the proportional counter array ( pca )",
    "we have only standard1 and standard2 data for the entire event .",
    "these data provide 290 kev time histories with 1/8 s temporal resolution ( standard1 ) and 16 s spectral accumulations across the 290 kev bandpass ( standard2 ) , respectively .",
    "although the pca bandpass is nominally 2 - 90 kev , for these data almost all source counts are in the 2 - 40 kev band .",
    "we did obtain some high time resolution event mode data ( sampling rate of 1/8192 hz ) but only for two time intervals in the decaying portion of the burst .",
    "unfortunately , we lost the high time resolution data during the onset of the burst",
    ". we will investigate the timing properties of 4u 1820 - 30 at the time of the super burst in a subsequent publication .",
    "the time history of the burst is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the 290 kev pca standard1 lightcurve with 1/8 s time resolution is the higher time resolution histogram ( left axis ) , while the ( 830)/(28 )  kev hardness ratio from standard2 data is the lower resolution histogram ( right axis ) .",
    "the burst was observed with 3 of the 5 proportional counter units ( pcus 0 , 2 , and 3 ) which comprise the pca .",
    "note that the time axis is logarithmic .",
    "the event began with a typical helium flash from 4u 1820 - 30 which extends from about 315 seconds in figure 2 .",
    "however , before this first burst dies away the super burst erupts and is still decaying away 10,000 s later when our observation ended .",
    "the event shows a clear ` precursor ' after which the x - ray flux dropped completely to background for a few seconds . a similar , but much weaker",
    "precursor can be seen in the helium flash burst just prior to the onset of the super burst .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of very powerful photospheric radius expansion bursts ( see hoffman et al . 1978 ; tawara et al .",
    "1984 ; lewin , vacca & basinska 1984 ; van paradijs et al . 1990 ) .",
    "note also the hardening of the spectrum following the precursor .",
    "this is characteristic of the contraction phase of a radius expansion burst .",
    "we found in the rxte archive one additional example of a helium flash burst from 4u 1820 - 30 . in figure 3",
    "we compare this burst , observed on may 2 , 1997 at 17:32:39 utc , with the helium flash which preceded the super burst .",
    "this he burst was observed with all 5 pcus , so in order to make a closer comparison we have scaled the observed count rate by 3/5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the lightcurve of each burst at 1/8 s resolution from the standard1 data mode .",
    "there are several things of note : both the preburst count rates as well as the peak count rate during the burst are similar , and each burst has a precursor or ` double peak ' which indicates photospheric radius expansion .",
    "the above features of the time profile , combined with the observed behavior of the hardness ratio , are consistent with a thermonuclear origin for both bursts .",
    "the much longer timescale of the super burst compared to the shorter , more frequent helium flashes suggests a larger reservoir of nuclear fuel released at much greater column depth below the surface .",
    "these considerations suggest that carbon and/or oxygen are the likely fuel sources for the super burst .",
    "later , in   4 , we will explore this scenario in greater detail .",
    "we used the standard2 data to investigate the x - ray spectrum both before and throughout the burst . for most of the burst",
    "we did not have spectral data in a high time resolution mode .",
    "this was unfortunate , but since the evolution timescale of this burst is much longer than a typical 10 s burst it was only a significant problem near the onset of the burst where the data suggest the black body temperature was changing on a timescale shorter than our 16 s accumulations .    before investigating the burst spectrum we analyzed the spectrum of the persistent , accretion driven flux .",
    "we used the standard pca background estimation software , pcabackest , to determine the pca detector background .",
    "for all the spectral results we used only the top layer of detectors 0 , 2 , and 3 of the pca .",
    "we found that the persistent flux before the burst is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( bremss in xspec ) with a temperature @xmath22 kev and flux of @xmath23 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath2 .",
    "figure 4 shows the time history of the thermal bremsstrahlung temperature , @xmath24 ( top panel ) , and the derived 220 kev flux ( bottom panel ) . at a distance of 6.6 kpc",
    "the observed flux corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath25 , consistent with previous measurements of the persistent luminosity when bursts are often observed ( clark et al .",
    "1977 ; haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "in most published analyses of burst spectral evolution the spectrum is obtained by subtracting off an estimate of the spectrum of the preburst , accretion driven flux .",
    "this should be reasonable when the burst flux does not appreciably disturb the accretion flow , however , during powerful radius expansion bursts it may be that the burst driven wind and near - eddington flux can substantially effect the accretion process ( see , for example , walker & meszaros 1989 ) .",
    "we investigated both subtracting off the preburst emission as a background and assuming that the accretion - driven flux is completely shut off by the burst .",
    "for the latter case we simply subtracted off the appropriate detector background estimated with pcabackest . in general",
    "we found that for the majority of the burst we were able to get better fits by subtracting off the preburst spectrum , so we will discuss our results using this method .",
    "the best fit parameter values showed modest quantitative differences ( @xmath26 ) when estimated using the two different background assumptions , but all of our qualitative conclusions are robust in the sense that they were independent of which assumption we used for the background .    because this burst is @xmath19 times longer than typical thermonuclear bursts the timescale on which the thermal continuum changes is also much longer .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain very high signal to noise spectra during intervals in which the black body temperature remains fairly constant .",
    "for example we were able to accumulate 64 s spectra throughout most of the burst and still obtain good fits to the continuum with single temperature black body models .",
    "the spectrum during the burst is indeed thermal , and evolves in a way which is entirely consistent with thermonuclear bursts of shorter duration .",
    "we found that a black body model with photoelectric absorption ( model wabs*bbodyrad in xspec ) alone usually did not provide an acceptable fit in the statistical sense , however , non - thermal continua gave much worse fits .",
    "the residuals when fitting a black body function and photoelectric absorption strongly suggest the presence of an emission line near 6.4 kev as well as an absorption edge between 79 kev . to model these components we included a gaussian emission line as well as an edge in our spectral model ( model wabs*(bbodyrad+gaus)*edge in xspec ) . with these components included we were able to obtain acceptable fits with @xmath27 per degree of freedom @xmath28 .",
    "figure 5 shows the characteristic residuals near the peak of the burst when the gaussian line and edge are removed from the model .",
    "shown are the residuals , data minus model , in units of standard deviations .",
    "these residuals appear to be qualitatively similar to those reported by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for a powerful burst from 4u 2127 + 11 in m15 .",
    "both the line and edge are strongly required to adequately model the data .",
    "figure 6 shows the count rate spectrum and residuals from a typical fit near the peak of the burst including the line and edge components , and demonstrates the quality of fit we can achieve with this model . in general we find that the gaussian line at @xmath29 kev has finite width and often an energy centroid significantly less than 6.4 kev , suggestive of a line produced by reflection from a relativistic accretion disk in 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "day & done ( 1991 ) had suggested that such a signature should be present in burst spectra , but to our knowledge this is the first compelling observational evidence for such an effect , and it opens up the prospect of probing directly the properties of accretion disks during long thermonuclear bursts . with the disk reflection mechanism in mind",
    "we also modeled the line as an fe fluorescence feature from an accretion disk ( model diskline in xspec ) .",
    "since the absorption edge will also be broadened by motions in the disk , we also included a smeared edge in these fits ( model smedge in xspec ) .",
    "we obtained excellent fits with this model for most of the burst duration except for about 100 s after the precursor . during this interval",
    "the photosphere is extended and the black body temperature is evolving too quickly for the 16 s standard2 accumulations to resolve .",
    "for this interval we would have greatly benefited from higher time resolution spectra .",
    "we summarize our investigation of the time evolution of the burst spectrum in figures 7 , 8 and 9 .",
    "figure 7 shows the time history of the burst from the standard1 data on a linear time axis .",
    "the vertical dashed lines denote the region in which we derived black body fits .",
    "the time evolution of the spectral parameters is shown in figures 8 and 9 . in each case",
    "the timespan is that of the interval between the dashed vertical lines in figure 7 .",
    "the derived black body flux , temperature , and inferred radius at 6.6 kpc are shown in figure 8 .",
    "the evolution of the line and edge parameters is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the evolution of the black body temperature and flux is very similar to that of other thermonuclear bursts , the only difference being that the timescale of the evolution is much longer . for comparison we also investigated the spectral evolution during the shorter ,",
    "helium flash observed from 4u 1820 - 30 on may 2 , 1997 .",
    "the peak black body temperature of both bursts approaches @xmath30 kev , and the peak fluxes are also consistent .",
    "this leaves no doubt about the thermonuclear origin of the super burst .",
    "the super burst from 4u 1820 - 30 provides a unique opportunity to try and use burst spectroscopy to constrain the radius of a neutron star .",
    "the fact that the source distance is reasonably well constrained , the accreted matter is likely pure helium , and the burst lasted so long  giving high signal to noise spectra ",
    "make such an effort well worthwhile .",
    "our aim in this paper is to lay out the basic properties of the super burst and a likely mechanism for its production .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to present a detailed spectroscopic study in an attempt to derive constraints on the neutron star radius , however , we can make some simple estimates using our black body spectral fits and previous calculations of pure helium , neutron star atmospheres .",
    "the spectrum of an x - ray burst is not expected to be strictly that of a black body .",
    "many authors have investigated the effects of electron scattering on the spectrum of x - ray bursting atmospheres , which is the dominant opacity source under the conditions typical during bursts ( see for example , london , taam & howard 1986 ; ebisuzaki 1987 ; titarchuck 1994 ; madej 1991 ; madej 1997 ) . what is found is that the observed color temperature ( ie .",
    "the temperature derived by fitting a black body function ) is higher ( harder ) than the actual effective temperature of the atmosphere by a factor which ranges from about 1.4 to 1.7 and is largely dependent on the local x - ray flux .",
    "this correction factor is usually referred to as the hardening factor .",
    "for example , ebisuzaki & nakamura ( 1988 ) provide analytic approximations for the hardening factors in x - ray bursting , pure helium atmospheres .",
    "these factors depend only on the ratio of the local flux to the eddington flux . using these hardening factors",
    "we can convert our measured color temperatures to effective temperatures and then infer the size of the neutron star using the formula ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the flux , effective temperature ( both measured far from the neutron star ) , stefan - boltzmann constant , and the source distance , respectively . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the gravitational mass and radius of the star , both measured at the stellar surface . because of the general relativistic effects this expression does not directly give an estimate of the radius independent of the mass .",
    "we used the flux and temperature measurements summarized in figure 8 along with the hardening factors from ebisuzaki & nakamura ( 1988 ) to evaluate the above expression ( assuming a distance of 6.6 kpc ) . for each pair of flux - temperature measurements we get an estimate of the quantity , @xmath38 the mean value of @xmath39 in these data is 18.3 km , which implies a mean radius range of 15.7 to 13.85 km for a mass range of 1.4 to 2 @xmath40 .",
    "this range of radii is about a factor of two larger than that determined by haberl & titarchuk ( 1995 ) for 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "we will explore the implications of the super burst for the mass - radius relation in 4u 1820 - 30 in greater detail in a sequel .",
    "the peak flux of @xmath41 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath2 during the super burst implies a peak isotropic luminosity of @xmath42 ergs s@xmath2 at a distance of 6.6 kpc .",
    "a neutron star with a pure helium photosphere has an eddington luminosity of @xmath43 ergs s@xmath2 , which for reasonable neutron star masses and radii is consistent with our inferred peak luminosity . to determine the total energy in the observable burst we integrated the flux vs time profile , linearly interpolating across the gaps .",
    "we find a total fluence of @xmath44 ergs @xmath8 . at a distance of 6.6 kpc",
    "this implies a total energy release of @xmath45 ergs .",
    "we note that these numbers should be considered lower limits since when our observations ended the burst flux was still decaying away .",
    "moreover , it is likely that a substantial fraction of the energy released in the carbon burning layer is emitted as neutrinos or conducted inward and only released on a timescale much longer than the observed burst ( see our discussion in   [ subsec : thermal - decay ] ) . nevertheless , the observed x - ray fluence is @xmath19 times greater than is released in a typical helium flash from 4u 1820 - 30 ( haberl et al .",
    "the basic physics of nuclear burning instabilities on neutron stars indicates that carbon and oxygen burning can in principle provide this amount of energy , but not helium ( see for example lamb & lamb 1978 ) .",
    "franco & strohmayer ( 1999 ) reported evidence for a @xmath29 kev emission line during the expansion phase of the may 2 , 1997 burst from 4u 1820 - 30 observed with rxte .",
    "there have been several previous claims of absorption lines between 4 and 5 kev from several burst sources , but their reality and interpretation have been controversial ( see for example waki et al .  1984 ; nakamura , inoue , & tanaka 1988 ; magnier et al .  1989 ; foster , ross , & fabian 1987 ; madej 1989 ) , and we note that these previous line claims have not been confirmed by subsequent observations , for example , with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) .",
    "our results leave no doubt that emission lines consistent with fe k@xmath46 fluorescence can be produced during x - ray bursts . what is the origin of these discrete spectral features ?",
    "a number of authors have investigated line production mechanisms during x - ray bursts .",
    "foster , ross , & fabian ( 1987 ) investigated the formation of fe features in the spectrum of cooling x - ray bursts .",
    "their models predict broad k@xmath46 emission features should be present along with a ` blend ' of photoelectric edges near 9.1 kev .",
    "we see both a broad line and an edge during the super burst , features similar to those predicted by foster , ross , & fabian ( 1987 ) , however , the observed energies of the features are somewhat problematic for this interpretation because the inferred redshifts are uncomfortably small for what would be expected from a canonical neutron star .",
    "for example , when our observed black body temperature reaches a maximum , the inferred line centroid is about 6.2 kev ( see figures 8 and 9 ) .",
    "if this resulted from a redshift of a 6.9 kev line of hydrogen - like fe , one would require a redshift @xmath47 which would imply a neutron star of radius 21.5 km for a mass of @xmath48 .",
    "this is prohibitively large even for the stiffest estimated neutron star equations of state .",
    "one might argue that the neutron star photosphere is still extended , but the temperature is thought to peak when touchdown of the photosphere has occurred .",
    "if the rest energy of the line were 6.7 kev then the problem is only exacerbated .",
    "it is possible , however , that because of the modest spectral resolution of these observations , the measured line centroid could be influenced by the choice of the continuum model , so these conclusions should still be considered cautiously .    as mentioned previously , day & done ( 1991 )",
    "suggested that a disk reflection component could be detected in the spectrum of x - ray bursts , and that detection of the absorption edge could be used to probe the ionization state of the disk .",
    "we think this is the simplest interpretation of the discrete features we see in the burst spectra .",
    "the inferred line centroids , which range from @xmath49  kev are comfortably consistent with an origin in the inner accretion disk",
    ". relativistic motions in the disk also broaden the line profile .",
    "furthermore , the inferred edge energies of @xmath50  kev are also consistent with this picture .",
    "changes in the inferred energy of the absorption edge also suggest corresponding changes in the ionization state of the disk .",
    "for example , the highest inferred edge energies correspond to the time when the black body flux and temperature were near their peaks , suggesting that the burst flux has a significant effect on the ionization state of the disk . the equivalent width of the @xmath29 kev line ranges from @xmath51 ev , but is typically about 130 ev .",
    "this is reasonably consistent with recent estimates derived from spectral modelling of reflection from x - ray illuminated disks ( see for example , li , gu & kahn 2001 ; nayakshin & kallman 2001 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) . in principle , if the energies of the emission line and edge are known then one can constrain the ionization state of the gas .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) tabulate the run of fe k line and edge energies with ionization parameter in the context of fe k@xmath46 observations of seyfert galaxies ( see their figure 2 ) . based on this compilation ,",
    "our line and edge energies appear consistent with an ionization parameter @xmath52 near the peak of the super burst .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the edge and line energies through the burst appears consistent with a decreasing ionization parameter as the burst evolves .",
    "this seems sensible , since the ionizing flux ( from the burst ) is decreasing with time .",
    "however , more precise spectral modelling will be required to investigate the implications for disk structure in detail .",
    "this will be left for a future study .    during the decay of the burst",
    "there is a highly significant hardening of the spectrum ( see figure 8 , near 3000 s ) .",
    "this is evidenced by an increase in the black body temperature along with a decrease in the inferred black body radius .",
    "even more interesting , the line flux and edge depth both decrease dramatically at the time of this spectral hardening ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "this behavior is somewhat reminiscent of state changes in other accreting x - ray binaries , but happens on a much shorter timescale .",
    "perhaps the inner disk is transitioning to a hot , optically thin condition , similar to an adaf ( see for example narayan , yi , & esin 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively , we could be seeing a geometric effect of something in the system shadowing the disk so that the reflected component is greatly reduced , perhaps a warp in the accretion disk .",
    "unfortunately , an earth occultation interval blocks our view of what happens next . also of note",
    "is the fact that shortly after this hardening episode chaotic dipping can be seen in the lightcurve for an extended period .",
    "although for part of this time the source is earth occulted , this dipping may be another indication of the accretion flow having been strongly affected by the burst .",
    "another possibility for the discrete components is that we are seeing fluorescence in the wind material blown off the star by the super - eddington burst . in this case",
    "one might expect to see a correlation of the line strength with the amount of absorbing material along the line of sight , and this does not seem to be the case .",
    "it seems likely that at some level all of these processes are at work , but it seems most plausible that disk reflection is the dominant mechanism .",
    "the uv modulations observed by anderson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest the system has an inclination @xmath53 ( see arons & king 1993 ) , which would provide a favorable geometry for reflection .",
    "the energy resolution of the pca is not sufficient to resolve the line and edge in detail .",
    "for example , a redshifted line from the neutron star photosphere could be obscured by the broad line produced by disk reflection .",
    "however , additional observations of such a burst with much higher spectral resolution could help distinguish amongst these different scenarios , and could provide us with a powerful new probe of the accretion process in lmxbs .",
    "having described the observation of the super burst and the evidence for it being thermonuclear in origin , we now examine its source of fuel and its ignition . in order for he burning to power the super burst ,",
    "the accumulated he must not ignite until the base of the helium layer reaches densities of order @xmath54 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can only occur if the atmosphere is extremely cold and in particular requires a local accretion rate @xmath55 @xcite in the absence of any heat flux from the core .",
    "such low accretion rates are not consistent with the observed flux and the presence of concurrent he flashes .",
    "the fact that a helium flash went off just prior to the super burst also indicates that helium can not be the primary energy source for the giant burst .",
    "we therefore discount the possibility that @xmath56 could be the fuel for the super burst .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the spectral evolution of the burst is roughly consistent with the release of energy at large densities in the star .",
    "the burning of carbon to iron - peak elements releases @xmath57 so that at least @xmath58 of carbon is needed to account for the energy released in the burst ( in   [ subsec : thermal - decay ] we argue that this is likely an underestimate of the total burst energetics ) .",
    "an @xmath59 mass of @xmath60 uniformly deposited over the surface of a neutron star of radius @xmath61 has a column density @xmath62 .",
    "hydrostatic balance gives the pressure at the base of the layer , @xmath63 ; from the equation of state and the thermal conductivity ( see   [ subsec : thermal - decay ] for details ) we may estimate the cooling timescale for a mass of newly formed @xmath64 to be @xmath65 , roughly consistent with the observed thermal decay timescale of the burst . here",
    "@xmath66 is the specific heat , per unit mass , @xmath67 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath68 is the density , and @xmath69 is the column depth .",
    "if mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation we expect an accretion rate of @xmath70 onto the neutron star ; this level is also roughly consistent with the accretion rate required to account for the persistent luminosity of @xmath71 .",
    "the precise rate is uncertain because of our lack of knowledge concerning the efficiency with which gravitational energy is converted to x - ray flux .",
    "if this conversion were 100% efficient , then one would require @xmath72 ( assuming a 1.4 @xmath40 and @xmath73 neutron star ) ; a more realistic number , however , is probably 520 % , so that the actual mass accretion rate could be higher than @xmath74 .",
    "isotropic ( over the stellar surface ) accretion at a rate of @xmath75 g s@xmath2 can deposit a sufficient amount of carbon to power the burst only after 0.20.6@xmath76@xmath77 , so such events should indeed be rare , consistent with only one such burst being observed from this source .",
    "unstable carbon burning on accreting neutron stars was conjectured by @xcite and studied by @xcite , who found that for accretion rates of @xmath78@xmath79 , the timescale for recurrence would be of order 10100@xmath76@xmath77 , with the bursts having an energy of order @xmath80 , about 100 times greater than that measured for this burst .",
    "while the original calculation of @xcite assumed accretion of hydrogen - rich material , recent calculations with large reaction networks for both unstable @xcite and steady - state burning @xcite find that only a small amount of @xmath60 is produced during hydrogen burning .",
    "for this reason , the scenario presented here ( i.e. , the ignition of a carbon - rich layer ) is probably not relevant for the super bursts seen from 4u  173544 , ks 1731 - 260 , gx  3 + 1 , ser x-1 and 4u 1636 - 53 , which are likely accreting a mix of hydrogen and helium ( see @xcite ; heise , in t zand , & kuulkers 2000 ; @xcite ; wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "the small amount of @xmath60 produced during rp - process burning might be a fuel for the other super - bursts ; for a discussion of this possibility , we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "while the burning of @xmath60 is a plausible cause of this super burst , the ignition of a pure carbon layer requires either high temperatures @xcite or a large mass of carbon @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we address these constraints .",
    "we begin (   [ subsec : c12-production ] ) by estimating the amount of carbon produced .",
    "we then (   [ subsec : ignition - carbon - layer ] ) investigate the conditions for ignition of a carbon - rich layer .",
    "we demonstrate , in the absence of a `` trigger , '' that a much larger mass of @xmath60 is required than that estimated from the observed burst energetics .",
    "section  [ subsec : thermal - decay ] provides a resolution to this dichotomy : namely , for very large bursts most of the heat is carried off by neutrinos , and of the heat conducted from the burning layer , a substantial amount flows _ inward _ , to be released on much longer timescales ( days to weeks ) .",
    "the long timescale for thermal diffusion at great depths means that only a fraction of the total burst energy is radiated away in the few hours following the burst rise .",
    "a consequence of requiring a massive carbon layer for ignition is that the recurrence times of such super bursts will be many years .      whether or not @xmath60 is produced by the burning of @xmath56 depends largely on whether the burning is stable .",
    "the ashes of stable he burning are composed mostly of @xmath60 at the lowest accretion rates compatible with stability @xcite . in contrast , unstable burning leads to much higher temperatures , which allow the reactions to run up to iron - peak nuclei .",
    "numerical calculations find that for unstable burning only a trace amount of residual he is expected ( @xmath81 by mass ; @xcite ) and no @xmath60 . because this source accretes nearly pure he , the endpoint of the unstable nucleosynthesis will be iron - peak nuclei , rather than the heavier species produced during mixed h / he burning .",
    "the luminosity of this source is variable by a factor of @xmath82 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and type i x - ray bursts are only observed when the luminosity is in its low state .",
    "the lack of unstable burning when the luminosity is high is somewhat puzzling , since the inferred accretion rate is still less than what is necessary for stability , according to linear analysis and time - dependent calculations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one possibility is that the burning is unstable , but that the flame front propagates at the slow conductive velocity @xcite .",
    "whether such fronts can slowly propagate on a rapidly rotating neutron star is an open question ( for a discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that the accretion flow does not spread over the entire surface prior to he ignition , as suggested by @xcite as an explanation for patterns of unstable hydrogen / helium burning on z - sources .",
    "if the efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy to x - ray luminosity is modest , then the inferred accretion rate can be substantially higher , reducing the discrepancy between theory and observation .",
    "one constraint on the amount of carbon produced would be the recurrence time of a super burst .",
    "we did search the rxte / asm archival lightcurve of 4u 1820 - 30 for additional instances of super bursts , but did not find any .",
    "although the asm monitors the whole sky it does not do so all the time , so that the total time during which another super burst from 4u 1820 - 30 could have been seen is only about 25 days out of a time span of about 5 years .",
    "since only one such event was seen and the total on source time was modest we can not place a strong constraint on the recurrence rate .",
    "it is unlikely to be much larger than 0.05 day@xmath2 , but could easily be ten times lower than this .",
    "we note that the source is only at or below the asm flux level at which thermonuclear bursts were observed for about @xmath83 of the time . for the purposes of this paper , we take the absence of observed type  i x - ray bursts during the episodes of high - luminosity as indication that @xmath60 is produced . over each 178 day cycle",

    "the choice of boundary condition at the other end of the computational domain ( set to @xmath127 ) is more problematic .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) simply took the flux to be zero at the inner boundary . for an accreting neutron star ,",

    "the thermal timescale in the inner crust is of order years @xcite and so the temperature there depends mostly on the time - averaged accretion rate .",

    "we show the temperature ( _ solid line _ ; left - side vertical axis ) and flux in units of mev per accreted nucleon ( _ dotted line _ ; right - side vertical axis ) . the arrow is to guide the eye and mark the value of @xmath132",
    "the top axis shows the time required to accrete a given column at @xmath133 .",
    "as we shall explain momentarily , it is plausible that the carbon and iron form a mixed layer ; we therefore change the mixture from @xmath134 to @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) at @xmath137 .",
    "the kink in the temperature at that point is because the conductivity decreases when we reset the composition .",
    "we chose @xmath136 as a minimal case for ignition .",
    "a larger @xmath138 would increase the ocean thermal conductivity and , for a fixed flux of @xmath139 , lower the ocean temperature .",
    "this increases both the recurrence time and the total burst energetics ( although , as we shall explain in the next section , a larger @xmath138 will not increase the x - ray fluence substantially because the additional energy is lost to neutrinos ) .",
    "a smaller @xmath138 may not ignite unstably @xcite . with a judicious use of hindsight ,",
    "we set the base of the c / fe layer at @xmath140 ( roughly where the @xmath60 will ignite ) ; at greater column the composition is pure fe .",
    "the point where the pure fe layer begins is marked in figure  [ fig : structure ] by the large black dot .    as explained in @xcite ,",
    "thermal conduction is more efficient at cooling the ocean than neutrino emission at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "the condition for ignition is crudely expressed as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is an approximation to @xmath143 .",
    "for the heating @xmath144 , we use the rate of @xcite and incorporate strong screening using the formalism of @xcite . in figure  [ fig : structure ] , we show the points where ignition occurs ( _ heavy dashed curve _ ) . note that the strong temperature sensitivity of the @xmath101 reaction means that the location of this curve is relatively insensitive to the precise method of defining ignition .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the temperature in the carbon - rich layer is too cold , by about a factor of 23 , for ignition to occur if the base of the carbon - rich layer is at @xmath145 .",
    "the presence of heavy elements ( e.g. , @xmath146 ) in the ocean of the other super burst sources makes the carbon - containing layer hotter , for a given flux from the crust and core , and allows for a smaller ignition column @xcite .    in this calculation",
    ", the mass of carbon at the depth where ignition occurs is @xmath147 .",
    "this is about a factor of 20 greater than that indicated by our estimate of the burst energetics . for a lesser @xmath138 ,",
    "the conductivity is lower and the temperature at which ignition occurs increases ; as pointed out by @xcite , however , the carbon burning will become stable at low accretion rates and small carbon abundances . their estimate implies that for the conditions we assume here , @xmath148 is required for unstable ignition . consistent with this estimate , we find that for this calculation the lifetime , @xmath149 , is slightly less than the accretion timescale @xmath150 at the ignition point .",
    "for this reason we do not consider smaller mass fractions of carbon .",
    "the temperature at the base of the carbon layer is mostly determined by the flux flowing from deeper in the star .",
    "the reason is that the heat flowing from the crust ( @xmath151 per accreted nucleon ) is larger than that generated by compressional heating ( @xmath152 per accreted nucleon ) , and the high conductivity of the degenerate plasma enforces a very shallow temperature gradient . at the time of the super burst , the accretion rate was lower than the mean , and the deep ocean was slightly colder than in this calculation , making ignition even more difficult .",
    "as mentioned earlier , locally high accretion rates onto a small portion of the stellar surface may be an explanation for the lack of bursts during the high - luminosity state of this source . at higher local accretion rates ,",
    "the ignition column decreases . to heat a confined carbon column to ignition at @xmath153 requires local accretion rates in excess of 5 times the local eddington rate @xcite .",
    "it is implausible , however , that the accreted matter would fail to spread over the surface prior to reaching this column .",
    "while strong magnetic fields ( @xmath154 ) could possibly confine such a large column @xcite , there is no evidence , such as pulsations in the persistent emission , for such strong organized fields in this source .    what about heating of the carbon layer during a type i x - ray burst ?",
    "the timescale to conduct the heat from the base of the he - rich layer to the surface is @xmath155 ( the decay timescale of the burst ) . unlike in the degenerate ocean",
    ", the dominant opacity is thompson scattering , for which the equivalent radiative conductivity is independent of depth . as a result ,",
    "the inward propagation of heat is inefficient ( as can be checked by a calculation similar to that described in equation  ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) and the heating of the carbon layer is too small to force an ignition .",
    "the fact that this source cyclically produces @xmath60 ( in the high - luminosity ) state and iron - peak elements ( through unsteady he burning in the low - luminosity state ) has some interesting consequences . during a he burst",
    ", the burning produces mostly @xmath64 .",
    "as the iron cools , it becomes denser than the underlying carbon , because the iron has fewer electrons per nucleon than helium .",
    "the base of the unstable he burning layer is therefore susceptible to first a secular salt - finger and then a rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "for example , at an interface pressure of @xmath156 and a @xmath60 temperature of @xmath157 , the iron layer is less dense than the carbon layer only when its temperature is @xmath158 .",
    "terrestrial rayleigh - taylor experiments and numerical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) suggest that the time @xmath159 for the interface ( between fluids of density @xmath68 and @xmath160 ) to traverse a distance @xmath161 is given by @xmath162^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath163 is the atwood number and @xmath164 is uncertain by a factor of 2 . taking @xmath161 to be a scale height , we find that for this case @xmath165 .",
    "thermal diffusion is ineffective on this timescale ; the characteristic distance over which heat can diffuse on this timescale is less than @xmath166 , which is much smaller than the pressure scale height ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the scaling of distance with @xmath168 comes about because of mergers between falling spikes into larger and larger drops ; in the case of a stratified medium , this effect is counteracted to some extent by compression of the falling spikes . as the iron `` plume '' descends ,",
    "the ambient medium ( carbon ) is entrained , reducing the buoyancy contrast and eventually halting its descent @xcite .",
    "because the mass of fe available after a he burst is much less than the mass of the carbon - rich layer , it is unlikely that the sinking fe will fall to the base of the carbon - rich layer . whether a descending plume would be able to spark an ignition of the carbon layer at @xmath169 , and whether a flame could propagate without quenching at those lower densities , is unknown . in any case , it is likely that at least some of the iron is mixed into the carbon layer and advected deeper into the star by continual accretion , so that ignition will occur in a mixed c / fe layer , as we have assumed .",
    "detailed calculations are outside the scope of this paper ; for now we leave this as an interesting possibility .",
    "as noted above , the ignition of @xmath60 , for conditions relevant to this source , requires either a large accumulated column of carbon - rich material , or a trigger , perhaps associated with an earlier he flash . in this subsection",
    ", we explore the evolution of an unstable ignition at @xmath140 of a c / fe layer ( @xmath136 ) . unlike for normal ( 1020  s duration ) type i x - ray bursts , the energetics of this super burst are much greater than that inferred from the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first is that neutrino cooling is more efficient than thermal conduction at the peak temperature ( @xmath170 ) reached in the burst .",
    "the second reason is that thermal conduction into deeper layers is efficient and competes with the outward thermal transport . because of the great depth of ignition , the thermal time is of order @xmath171 and is much longer than the duration of the observation .",
    "we now consider each of these cooling mechanisms in turn .",
    "once the instability begins , the heating timescale @xmath172 is , by definition , shorter than both the thermal conduction and neutrino cooling timescales . at first the nuclear burning timescale is comparable to the thermal conduction time ( @xmath173 ; @xcite ) , but it accelerates with increasing temperature .",
    "we calculate the peak temperature from the equation @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the energy per gram released in burning @xmath60 to fe - peak elements . for a pure carbon layer",
    ", the temperature would reach @xmath176 if all the carbon burned to iron .",
    "note that even at this extreme temperature , the electrons are still ( mildly ) degenerate ; the fermi energy is @xmath177 .",
    "in addition , the radiation pressure , at this temperature , is only @xmath178 , about a tenth of the total . unlike in he burning ,",
    "the peak temperature is therefore not limited by the expansion of the burning layer if the base of that layer is sufficiently deep .",
    "because of the high density , photodisintegration reactions are also unimportant until temperatures in excess of @xmath179 are reached , as can be checked by a saha - type equation . for the abundance ( @xmath136 ) used in figure  [ fig : structure ] , @xmath180 .    although neutrino cooling is unimportant for stabilizing the ignition of carbon on a neutron star @xcite , it is more efficient than thermal conduction when the burning layer is at its peak temperature .",
    "in addition , thermal conduction to the surface is more efficient at lower column and competes more effectively with neutrino cooling . for a very deep layer",

    "the neutrino emissivity _ decreases _ as density increases because of the rising electron fermi energy ( see fig .",

    "an ignition column of @xmath210 takes @xmath224 . if the accretion rate were much higher than that inferred by the x - ray luminosity , than the ocean would be hotter , and the ignition column reduced .",
    "recurrence times of less than a year would require that @xmath225 , however , or that the ignition be prematurely triggered .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the heating from this burst can quench type i x - ray bursts until the cooling luminosity is @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "if the scenario we outline is correct , then no type  i x - ray bursts should have occurred in the week following the super burst .",
    "distinguishing the elevated flux following the burst will be more difficult , given the variability of the accretion flux",
    ". the strongest constraint on this scenario would be if another super burst were detected after a timescale much less than a decade .",
    "this would suggest that the carbon ignition is triggered .",
    "the fact that a he burst occurred immediately prior to the super burst is intriguing ; if the carbon ignition did occur at large densities , then the thermal instability began several hours prior to the observed rise of the burst .",
    "it is possible that the flux from the carbon runaway could ignite any accumulated he .",
    "while the calculations presented here are suggestive , they are very crude and could be substantially improved .",
    "evolutionary calculations , with reaction networks , of the ignition and subsequent evolution of this burst , coupled with similar calculations for the super bursts seen from hydrogen accreting sources , can inform us about the relevant physics at work in the deep ocean . continued x - ray monitoring of the source should eventually give a better constraint on the recurrence time .",
    "an important quantity is the amount of carbon produced ; for the scenario we outline here to work , roughly half of the accreted matter must burn to carbon so that the ignition is indeed unstable .",
    "the x - ray spectrum during the burst reveals a broad emission line indicative of fe k@xmath46 fluorescence as well as an absorption edge in the 79  kev range .",
    "the very high signal - to - noise spectra obtained during the burst make the detection of these discrete features extremely secure .",
    "previous authors have predicted that such features might be produced by disk reflection ( see for example day & done 1991 ) , but to our knowledge this is the first confident detection",
    ". detailed modeling of these features could provide a new probe of the accretion disk in bursting systems .",
    "here we have only scratched the surface in terms of investigating the discrete components . an in - depth study and interpretation of the line and edge",
    "will be presented in a future publication .",

    "<S> this is the longest x - ray burst ever observed from this source , and perhaps one of the longest ever observed in great detail from any source . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the super burst is thermonuclear in origin . </S>",
    "<S> its peak luminosity of @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 is consistent with the helium eddington limit for a neutron star at @xmath3 kpc , as well as the peak luminosity of other , shorter , thermonuclear bursts from the same source . </S>",
    "<S> the super burst begins in the decaying tail of a more typical ( @xmath4 s duration ) thermonuclear burst . </S>",
    "<S> these shorter , more frequent bursts are well known helium flashes from this source . </S>",
    "<S> the level of the accretion driven flux as well as the observed energy release of upwards of @xmath5 ergs indicate that helium could not be the energy source for the super burst . </S>",
    "<S> we outline the physics relevant to carbon production and burning on helium accreting neutron stars and present calculations of the thermal evolution and stability of a carbon layer and show that this process is the most likely explanation for the super burst . </S>",

    "<S> we show , however , that for large columns of accreted carbon fuel , a substantial fraction of the energy released in the carbon burning layer is radiated away as neutrinos , and the heat that is conducted from the burning layer in large part flows inward , only to be released on timescales longer than the observed burst . </S>",

    "<S> spectral analysis during the super burst reveals the presence of a broad emission line between @xmath10 kev and an edge at @xmath11 kev likely due to reflection of the burst flux from the inner accretion disk in 4u 1820 - 30 . </S>",
