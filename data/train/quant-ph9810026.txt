    "in a recent paper@xcite , yczkowski , horodecki , sanpera and lewenstein ( zhsl ) @xcite sought to estimate `` how many entangled ( disentangled ) states exist among all quantum states '' .",
    "they gave three principal reasons for their study : ( 1 ) to answer the question `` is the world _ more classical _ or _ more quantum _ ? '' ; ( 2 ) to know , for the purposes of numerical simulation , `` to what extent entangled quantum systems may be considered as typical '' ; and ( 3 ) `` to investigate how frequently certain nonseparable states , ` peculiarly ' admitting time reversal in one subsystem , arise '' . in response to the first query , zhsl concluded  to their `` surprise '' @xcite  that although the ( higher - dimensional ) `` world '' is , in general , more quantum than classical , this is not so for the @xmath3 quantum systems .",
    "we contend here , however , that alternative analyses based on the concept of _ monotone _ metrics on classical and quantum systems @xcite , lead to the elimination of this exception to their general rule .    in their investigation",
    ", zhsl obtained a variety of both analytical and numerical bounds on the volumes of the sets of separable states for various dimensions , using what they asserted was a `` natural measure '' on the space of density matrices ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the first analytical part of this communication ( sec .  [ semiclassical ] )",
    ", we indicate an essential degree of arbitrariness in the choice of measure by zhsl , and its consequences for the results they have reported ( cf .",
    "we then argue in favor of a specific alternative  well - founded on statistical principles  which leads to a markedly _ smaller _ probability of encountering a disentangled ( separable ) state .",
    "( the numerical results we report are for the @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quantum systems . )",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ quantum ] , we study the use of methods more fundamentally quantum - theoretic in nature  requiring us to develop a quite distinct set of procedures than those used by zhsl and followed in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] .",
    "( due to the associated large computational demands , we have primarily limited our analyses to the @xmath3 systems , but in sec  [ quanttwobythree ] we do , in fact , initiate a parallel investigation of the @xmath6 systems . ) we obtain for each of more than thirty pairs of parameters , determining the fineness of approximating square grids and three - dimensional simplicial decompositions , a set of three probabilities of disentanglement ( table  [ table1 ] ) , each probability being based on a distinct form of monotone metric @xcite .",
    "the sets are intended to determine a range of values within which any suitable candidate ( meeting underlying natural criteria of _ monotonicity _ ) for the `` true '' _ a priori _ probability of disentanglement must lie .",
    "essentially all such probabilities we obtain turn out to be considerably smaller than both the result of zhsl ( @xmath8 ) and the alternative to it ( @xmath9 ) we promote in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] , based on the jeffreys prior of bayesian theory .",
    "however , the need for additional computational work is indicated in order to sharpen the estimates reported in secs .",
    "[ n123n27 ] [ n119n28 ] and [ additional ] , as well as to extend our general approach to higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "( we are reminded , to some degree , of the computational / combinatorial challenges of lattice gauge theory @xcite . ) in sec .  [",
    "restricted ] , we switch from the explicit enumeration approach ( based on regular grids and simplicial decompositions ) to a randomization methodology ( such as zhsl employed in their studies )  but also find this to be highly computationally demanding , since we must search in a high - dimensional parameter space for those particular points corresponding to density matrices .",
    "a conservative evaluation of the accumulated evidence of the multiple quantum - theoretic analyses we report ( tables  [ table1 ] [ table2 ] [ tablerandom ] ) indicates that the _ a priori _ probability of disentanglement for the @xmath3 systems should be regarded  using any of a continuum of possible acceptable standards , in particular that provided by the _ minimal _",
    "monotone ( bures ) metric  as _ no more _ than eleven percent . as to a _",
    "lower _ bound , on the other hand , on the probability of separability , it remains an unsettled issue as to whether or not the _ maximal _ monotone metric should be viewed as furnishing a bound strictly greater than zero .    in our concluding remarks ( sec .",
    "[ concluding ] ) , we draw attention to an interesting recent analysis of m. byrd ( personal communication ) , bearing upon the issue of whether or not the use of `` over - parameterizations '' by zhsl and ( following them ) by us in sec",
    ".  [ semiclassical ] , can be averted .",
    "zhsl @xcite used as a measure on the space of @xmath10 density matrices the product of the haar measure for the unitary group @xmath11 and the uniform distribution on the @xmath12-dimensional simplex spanned by the @xmath0 eigenvalues of the density matrix .",
    "now , we see no basis ( within the semiclassical framework adopted by zhsl ) for questioning the use of the haar measure",
    ". however , the selection of the uniform distribution on the simplex appears not to be so compelling , as it lacks as convincing a rationale as the group - theoretic argument for the haar measure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . also , we must point out that the analyses of zhsl are based on `` over - parametrizations '' , since @xmath13 parameters are used , while the convex set of @xmath10 density matrices is only @xmath14)-dimensional in nature .",
    "though we adhere to this over - parameterization in the analyses of this section , in sec .",
    "[ quantum ] we revert to the more natural and conventional form .    the uniform distribution on the @xmath12-dimensional simplex ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ) can be considered to be that specific member of the ( continuous ) family of dirichlet probability distributions @xcite ,",
    "@xmath17 which has all its @xmath0 parameters ( @xmath18 s ) set equal to unity .",
    "the family of dirchlet distributions is _ conjugate _ , in that if one selects a _ prior _ distribution belonging to it , then , through the application of bayes rule to observations drawn from a multinomial distribution , one arrives at a _",
    "posterior _ distribution which is also within the family .      of strongest interest , however , for our purposes here , is that the principle of reparameterization invariance ( based on the _ fisher information _",
    "@xcite ) leads to the special case ( the jeffreys prior ) in which ( [ dirichletdist ] ) has all its @xmath0 parameters set equal to _ one - half _",
    "* eq . ( 3.7 ) ) @xcite and not _ unity _ , as for the uniform distribution .",
    "`` the main intuitive motivation for jeffreys priors is _ not _ their invariance , which is certainly a necessary , but in general far from sufficient condition to determine a sensible reference prior ; what makes jeffreys priors unique is that they are _ uniform _ measures in a particular metric which may be defended as the ` natural ' choice for statistical inference '' @xcite . by way of illustration , kass @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , using the transformations @xmath19 , demonstrates how the jeffreys prior for the trinomial model ( @xmath20 ) on the two - dimensional simplex , can be ( making use of spherical polar coordinates ) transformed to the uniform distribution on the positive - octant portion of the two - dimensional sphere , @xmath21 of radius 2 .",
    "( braunstein and milburn @xcite show that for two - level _ quantum _ systems , statistical distinguishability is just the [ bures / minimal monotone ] metric on the surface of the unit sphere in _ four _ dimensions .",
    "in contrast , the space of @xmath22-level quantum systems is `` not a space of constant curvature for @xmath23 and not even a locally symmetric space .",
    "the physical meaning of this fact seems to be an interesting open question '' @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . )    clarke and barron @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) have established that jeffreys priors ( the normalized volume elements of fisher information metrics ) asymptotically maximize shannon s mutual information between a sample of size @xmath22 and the parameter , and that jeffreys prior is the unique continuous prior that achieves the asymptotic minimax risk when the loss function is the kullback - leibler distance between the true density and the predictive density .",
    "( the possibility of extending the `` universal coding '' results of clarke and barron to the _ quantum _ domain , has been investigated in @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . )",
    "clarke @xcite asserts that `` jeffreys prior can be justified by four distinct arguments '' .",
    "in addition , balasubramanian @xcite `` cast parametric model selection as a disordered statistical mechanics on the space of probability distributions '' and `` derived and discussed a novel interpretation of jeffreys prior as the uniform prior on the probability distributions indexed by a parametric family '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now , it is of interest to note that in the limit in which the @xmath0 parameters ( @xmath18 s ) of the dirichlet distribution ( [ dirichletdist ] ) all go to zero , the distribution becomes totally concentrated on the pure states of the @xmath0-dimensional quantum system . since zhsl showed that in `` the subspace of all pure states , the measure of separable states is equal to zero '' @xcite , we would anticipate , making use of a continuity argument , that the measure or volume of the set of separable states would increase if all @xmath0 parameters of ( [ dirichletdist ] ) were fixed at one - half ( jeffreys prior ) , but still be less than if they were all taken to be equal to unity , _ etc_. ( `` the purer a quantum state is , the smaller its probability of being separable '' @xcite . )",
    "we have , in fact , tested these last contentions regarding competing measures of separability , through numerical means , first , generating a set of three thousand random @xmath24 unitary matrices ( @xmath25 ) , following the ( hurwitz / euler angle ) prescription given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 3.1)-(3.5 ) ) . from it",
    ", we produced ( in the manner of zhsl ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 34 ) ) ) three sets of three thousand @xmath24 density matrices : one set based on the selection @xmath26 ; another for @xmath27 ( as , in effect , done in @xcite ) ; and a third for @xmath28 .",
    "( random realizations of the dirichlet distributions were generated based on the fact that they can be considered to be joint distributions of [ univariate ] gamma distributions @xcite .",
    "the three thousand instances we obtain are obviously far fewer in number than the `` several millions '' zhsl @xcite apparently employed as a general rule in their series of analyses of quantum systems of various dimensions .",
    "this is primarily due to our full reliance on mathematica , while zhsl  as k. yczkowski wrote in a personal communication  employed fortran routines for random number generation . nevertheless , as noted immediately below , yczkowski , using his speedier routines , has confirmed the main aspects of our analysis .",
    "additionally , the _ quantum - theoretic _ analyses of sec .",
    "[ quantum ] require a quite different set of algorithms , and it is far from clear whether our use there of mathematica is in any way relatively inefficient . )    then , we determined whether all ( nine of ) the eigenvalues of the _ partial transpositions _ of the random density matrices ( viewing them as @xmath29 density matrices , in the manner of ( 21 ) in @xcite ) were positive ( as they must be in the separable case ) or not",
    ". for the @xmath30 ( jeffreys prior ) scenario , eighty - three of the three thousand density matrices had this positivity property , while considerably more ( six hundred and two ) possessed it for @xmath31 and still more ( one thousand two hundred and ninety - six ) for @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we note an approximate decrease by a factor of @xmath33 in the upper bound on our suggested probability of encountering a separable state _ vis -  - vis _ the analysis of zhsl .",
    "we , then , conducted parallel analyses to those in sec .",
    "[ sec3x3 ] for the @xmath6 and @xmath3 systems .",
    "( for both such systems , but not higher - dimensional ones , such as the @xmath7 , the positivity of the partial transposition is a sufficient , as well as necessary condition for separability @xcite .",
    "so , we will be estimating probabilities themselves , rather than upper bounds on them . ) in both cases , we now employed ten thousand realizations . in the @xmath6 case , we found 1,309 separable states , using @xmath30 , and 4,135 for @xmath34 , as well as 6,357 for @xmath32 .",
    "( our statistic of .4135 needs to be compared with that of @xmath35 of zhsl  which , as noted , was based on a much larger sample . ) for the @xmath3 systems , the analogous results were : 3,633 ; 6,564 ; and 7,946 .",
    "so , we would conclude , in this analytical framework , that the proportion of separable states among the @xmath3 quantum systems should be taken to be approximately .36  which is well _ below _ the demarcation point of .5 , _ above _ which zhsl found their result of @xmath36 ( roughly comparable to ours of .6564 ) to ( counterintuitively ) lie .",
    "k. yczkowski has kindly repeated the analyses reported above for the case @xmath30 ( that is , jeffreys prior ) , using 200,000 random realizations for each of the three scenarios .",
    "the probabilities of separability he obtained were ( all digits being significant he states ) : .022 ( for the @xmath7 systems ) ; .122 ( @xmath6 systems ) ; and .352 ( @xmath3 systems ) .",
    "these should be compared with our results ( based on considerably smaller samples ) of .0277 , .1309 and .3633 , respectively .",
    "these various numerical results are , thus , quite supportive of our arguments and help to fulfill the first objective of this letter of showing the dependence of estimates of the volume of the set of separable states on the particular choice of ( symmetric ) dirichlet distribution on the @xmath12-dimensional simplex spanned by the @xmath0 eigenvalues of the @xmath10 density matrix ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we note again that zhsl @xcite expressed `` surprise that the probability that a mixed state @xmath38 is separable exceeds fifty percent '' .",
    "thus , they would have apparently been not so confounded if the uniform distribution on the three - simplex of eigenvalues had been replaced by the jeffreys prior , since its use yields a _ more modest _ percentage of approximately thirty - five .",
    "let us also note that our suggested modification ( @xmath30 ) of the zhsl measure ( @xmath39 ) would appear to find some support in a recent paper concerned with a parameterization ( sharing certain features with that of zhsl ) of the @xmath10 density matrices @xcite .",
    "its authors consider the @xmath0 eigenvalues to be parameterized by the `` squared components '' of the @xmath12-sphere ( rather than coordinates in the @xmath12-dimensional simplex , as in zhsl ) . as noted above , in relation to @xcite , the jeffreys prior",
    "is simply the uniform distribution on such a _ sphere _  while zhsl used instead the uniform distribution on the _",
    "in @xcite , we presented evidence that certain statistical features of the product measure employed by zhsl @xcite were not reproducible through the use of any of the possible ( continuum of ) _ monotone _ metrics .",
    "a similar conclusion appears to hold if one replaces the uniform distribution in the zhsl product measure ( as we have done above in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] ) by any other member of the family of dirichlet distributions ( [ dirichletdist ] ) .",
    "since petz and sudr @xcite have argued that monotone metrics are the quantum analogues of the ( classically unique ) fisher information metric , it would seem highly desirable to replace the product measures so far employed by ones based directly on the volume elements of such metrics .",
    "( in @xcite , efforts were reported to integrate the volume elements of the _ minimal _ and _ maximal _ monotone metrics over the convex sets of @xmath7 and @xmath40 density matrices . ) in so doing , we would avoid the nonparsimonious `` over - parameterization '' mentioned at the outset of sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] .",
    "( however , it will be incumbent upon us to develop a quite distinct set of computational methods than those used by zhsl and applied in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] . )",
    "we have , in fact , conducted such a series of analyses for the @xmath3 quantum systems , based on a mathematica program containing _ two _ parameters of choice , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 determines the fineness of a regular decomposition of the three - dimensional simplex  the points of which correspond now to the _ diagonal _ entries of @xmath37 , and not the _ eigenvalues _ , as in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] and the work of zhsl @xcite and boya _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "( of course , both the eigenvalues and diagonal entries of a density matrix are nonnegative and sum to unity . to compute the coordinates of",
    "the simplicial coordinates , we followed an algorithm for the next _ composition _ of an integer @xmath0 into @xmath43 parts , given in @xcite , taking @xmath44 for our purposes , and then dividing each of the @xmath45 compositions generated by @xmath0 . ) the reciprocal of the parameter @xmath42 is the distance between adjacent points of a regular square grid  having its extreme points / corners at @xmath46 and @xmath47  imposed on a circle of radius one - half centered at the origin of the complex plane .",
    "( the off - diagonal entries of a density matrix can not exceed one - half in absolute value , so they must lie within this circle . )    for specific values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , within but challenging our computational capabilities , we generated the associated three - dimensional simplicial decompositions and twelve - dimensional uniform lattices ( the six - fold cartesian product of the imposed two - dimensional square grid  six , of course , corresponding to the number of pairs of off - diagonal entries ) .",
    "then , we explicitly enumerated all those points in the fifteen - dimensional product space parameterizing the @xmath40 density matrices of mixed states ( that is , yielding matrices having all strictly positive eigenvalues , noting that the additional hermiticity and trace requirements are automatically satisfied by construction ) .",
    "we would reject any density matrices of pure states ( the totality of which form a six - dimensional subspace @xcite ) that happened to be generated , since our measures ( see immediately below ) are singular on them , as well as more generally , degenerate density matrices , those density matrices not being of full rank ( and hence having zero determinant ) .",
    "however , the possibility remains  in particular , since we will be computing ( nonrobust ) _ averages _  that the behavior of the measures for a relatively few _ nearly _ degenerate states , can strongly influence the results ( cf .",
    "tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] ) .    by our purposeful design ,",
    "the explicitly enumerated points are uniformly distributed ( using the conventional parameterization ) in the fifteen - dimensional convex set of @xmath40 density matrices .",
    "we took several significant steps in our mathematica ( `` backtrack '' @xcite ) program to cut down on the ( potentially huge ) search spaces , by utilizing the requirement that all the principal minors of a density matrix must be nonnegative ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.2.5 ) @xcite .",
    "( a _ sufficient _ condition only , of possible interest , would be that the matrix is _ diagonally - dominant _ @xcite . ) also , in our later , larger analyses , we exploited certain permutational symmetries .",
    "we , then , employed an _",
    "ansatz _ of ours @xcite , building upon a result of dittmann @xcite ( pertaining to the bures or minimal monotone metric ) regarding the spectrum of the sum of the operators of left and right multiplication of matrices cf .",
    "@xcite . utilizing it",
    ", we assigned as a weight to each density matrix ( @xmath37 ) generated ( the eigenvalues of which are denoted by @xmath48 ) , the volume elements of certain monotone metrics of particular interest .",
    "these elements we took to be of the form @xmath49^{{1 \\over 2}}$ ] , where ( the `` morozova - chentsov '' function @xcite ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) ) @xmath50 is equal to @xmath51 in the minimal monotone case , @xmath52 in the maximal monotone case , and for the kubo ",
    "mori / bogoliubov ( kmb ) metric ( associated with the relative entropy ) @xcite , @xmath53 .",
    "( in this last case , if @xmath54 , we take @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inverses of these morozova - chentsov functions are simply well - known indicators of _ central tendency _ , such as the arithmetic mean , the logarithmic mean , and the harmonic mean @xcite . choosing a particular monotone metric is , therefore , akin to selecting such an indicator . )",
    "we also checked if @xmath37 satisfied the partial transposition condition , necessary for separability .",
    "we now report several sets of results in this regard  but let us first make some important observations ( taking into account that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues ) . using the formulas just given , one can show @xcite that for an @xmath10 density matrix ( @xmath37 ) , the volume element of the minimal monotone metric ( and also the kmb - metric ) is directly proportional to @xmath56 , while for the maximal monotone metric , the volume element is directly proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "so , the divergence near the boundary of degenerate states ( @xmath58 ) of the volume element of the maximal monotone metric is much more severe than for the other two metrics under investigation .",
    "in fact , in our previous studies @xcite , we have concluded that the integral of the volume element of the maximal monotone metric over the convex set of @xmath3 density matrices does _ not _ converge ( in contrast to those for the minimal monotone and kmb - metrics ) .",
    "( for @xmath59 , however , the issue of convergence appears to be unsettled . )",
    "so , it would seem that  unless one chooses to remove from consideration ( as was done in @xcite , for inferential purposes ) those states the degeneracy of which exceeds some prescribed level @xcite ( cf . sec .",
    "[ truncate ] )  one can not , in fact , define a probability distribution based on the maximal monotone metric .",
    "we have been able , however , for @xmath20 , by taking the limit of a certain ratio , to obtain associated _ marginal _ probability distributions using the maximal monotone metric @xcite . ) also , the maximal monotone metric is of substantial interest , in that it has been characterized as the most _ noninformative _ of the monotone metrics @xcite .",
    "the motivating hypothesis for pursuing the analyses immediately below is that one should be able to find values of the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 large enough ( say , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , so that the associated probabilities of disentanglement are within some @xmath62 of each other for _ any _ choices of @xmath41 and @xmath42 which _ dominate _ both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "( it is useful to bear in mind , however , that there is a qualitative difference between analyses based on _ even _ or _ odd _ values of @xmath42 , as will be indicated . )",
    "this would indicate a convergence of these probabilities in the continuum limit as @xmath41 and @xmath42 each become indefinitely large .",
    "the choice of @xmath64 leads to a square grid , having thirty - two points  serving as trial off - diagonal entries  lying within the circle of radius one - half .",
    "( the particular arrangement of the lattice points , then , mandates that those density matrices we will be able to construct will have off - diagonal entries of modulus no less than @xmath65 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the product of any pair of diagonal entries of the density matrices will not be less than this value . )",
    "the numbers of density matrices we were , then , able to construct were 1,340,928 .",
    "of these , 356,096 passed the transposition test for separability . applying the weights based on the three monotone metrics considered",
    ", we obtained prior probabilities of encountering separable states of @xmath66 of course , these three values are all considerably less than both the zhsl statistic of @xmath36 and the preferred one ( of the three given ) of sec .  [ semiclassical ] based on the jeffreys prior , that is , @xmath67 .",
    "we have also computed the `` degree of entanglement '' , @xmath68 ( which must lie between zero and unity ) for all the ( 1,340,928 ) density matrices and averaged the results with the same set of three weights as used to obtain ( [ probs1 ] ) .",

    "( zhsl remarked that this quantity seemed to saturate at approximately 0.10 for large systems . )      since the parameter @xmath42 is now an even integer , the origin ( 0,0 ) of the complex plane becomes , by our particular mode of construction , one of the forty - nine intersection points of the square grid lying within the circle of trial values for the off - diagonal entries .",
    "there are , then , no nontrivial lower bounds imposed on the moduli of these entries , as there are for odd values of @xmath42  such as _ seven _ in the immediately preceding analysis of sec .  [ n123n27 ] .",
    "we obtained 4,443,408 density matrices , of which 1,284,816 satisfied the separability criterion .",
    "use of the volume elements of the three selected monotone metrics as weights resulted in @xmath72 and @xmath73      continuing along the same lines as secs .",
    "[ n123n27 ] and [ n119n28 ] , we have conducted analyses for additional choices of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "the analyses are listed in increasing order of the total number of density matrices generated .",
    "( during the course of conducting these analyses , we were able to undertake larger - sized studies , corresponding to those listed at the bottom of the table , by taking advantage of certain inherent permutational symmetries .",
    "an analogous assertion can be made in regard to table  [ early ] . )    as a general rule , the probability of disentanglement is greatest for the minimal monotone metric , although still markedly less than the zhsl result ( @xmath2 ) or that of sec .

    "the stability of the results , on the other hand , is least for the maximal monotone metric ( in particular , notoriously so , for the case , @xmath74 , @xmath64  but see sec .",
    "[ restricted ] ) .",
    "this instability may be explainable by the fact that the volume element of the maximal monotone metric , as previously noted , is not normalizable ( to form a probability distribution ) over the convex sets of @xmath10 density matrices ( in particular , for @xmath75 ) , being highly singular near the degenerate states ( while the volume elements of the minimal and kmb metrics , though , still singular , are markedly less so , and are apparently normalizable , extrapolating from the @xmath3 case ) .",
    "so , one might rely upon either the minimal monotone metric or kmb - metric to provide estimates of the probabilities of disentanglement ( separability )  as well as simulations of entangled systems , as zhsl envisioned .",
    "we believe that estimates based on the minimal monotone metric should , at least for fine enough grids and simplicial decompositions , dominate estimates based on any other member of the _ continuum _ of monotone metrics .",

    "cum grano salis_.    let us also note a specific relation between the minimal monotone ( bures ) metric and the results of zhsl .",

    "now , in their analysis , zhsl concluded both that all states in a small enough neighborhood of the totally mixed state are separable , and that the `` purer a quantum state is , the smaller its probability of being separable '' @xcite .",
    "et al _ have given `` a constructive proof that all mixed states of @xmath0 qubits in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the maximally mixed state are separable '' @xcite , while vidal and tarrach have also reached the same conclusion @xcite .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of introducing a third parameter of choice , that is @xmath80  in addition to @xmath41 and @xmath42  into our computations .",
    "it would control the level of degeneracy below which we reject for further consideration ( due to the singular behavior of the volume elements of the monotone metrics ) , the ( nearly degenerate ) density matrices our explicit enumeration method of sec .",
    "[ quantum ] generates .",
    "( this third parameter has been implicitly zero in sec .",

    "we report these results in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "it appears then ( based on the smallest nonzero threshold , that is @xmath82 ) that the previously reported ( zero - threshold ) anomalous behavior for the maximal and kmb - monotone metrics was attributable to some set ( the number of which we are not certain ) of near - degenerate states which , in fact , passed the partial transposition test for separability .      in the previous quantum - theoretic statistical analyses of this section",

    "there are now six diagonal entries ( associated with @xmath41 ) and fifteen pairs of off - diagonal entries ( associated with @xmath42 ) to consider , so computational demands are substantially increased .",
    "we , of course , expect the probabilities of separability to be _ less _ than the corresponding ones in the @xmath3 case reported in table  [ table1 ] , and this is certainly the case for the most extensive analysis ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "the somewhat counterintuitive observation that for @xmath94 , the choice of @xmath93 leads to many more generated density matrices than for @xmath95 , is comprehensible in that only for even values of @xmath42 are no nonzero lower bounds placed on the possible absolute values of off - diagonal entries .",
    "we were not able for any @xmath96 scenario  due to memory limitations  to find a large enough @xmath41 , for which any density matrices at all were generated .",

    "we have presented in this study , two forms of evidence ( one essentially classical and the other , quantum - theoretic in nature ) that the specific choice of ( product ) measure of zhsl @xcite led them to substantially overestimate the extent to which quantum systems  in particular , for @xmath1 and @xmath6  should be considered to possess , in some natural _ a priori _ sense , the property of separability or disentanglement .",
    "the preponderance of evidence adduced indicates that the probability of separability for the @xmath100 systems , based on the minimal monotone ( bures ) metric is no greater than eleven percent  and if one views the evidence somewhat less conservatively , perhaps less than ten percent . in turn",
    ", estimates founded on any other member of the continuum of monotone metrics should be lower still .",
    "for instance , for the kubo - mori / bogoliubov metric @xcite , an estimate of nine percent would seem conservatively high .",
    "apparently , the _ maximal _ monotone metric  the volume element of which possesses a high degree of singularity on the degenerate states ( @xmath101 ) , associated with its conjectured nonnormalizability over the fifteen - dimensional convex set of states  must , in some ( perhaps limiting ) sense , furnish a _ lower _ bound on the probability of separability .",
    "this bound would have to be strictly greater than zero , if the related arguments made in @xcite , in fact , apply .",
    "let us also note that in continuing work , pertaining to @xcite , we have found a quite interesting distinguished role ( that of yielding both the _ minimax _ and _ maximin _ in universal quantum coding ) for a monotone metric that has not apparently previously been noted .",
    "its associated morozova - chentsov function , @xmath102 is simply the reciprocal of the _ exponential _ or _ identric _ mean @xcite of @xmath48 and @xmath103 .",
    "the behavior of the related monotone metric appears to be quite close to that of the minimal ( bures ) monotone metric .",
    "the need for additional computational work ( possibly utilizing supercomputers ) is indicated , in regard to what we contend are the theoretically superior ( properly parameterized ) quantum - theoretic analyses of sec .  [ quantum ] , in order to more closely pinpoint estimates .",
    "such analyses could be based on finer simplicial decompositions for the trial diagonal entries ( that is , higher values of @xmath41 ) and finer square grids for the trial off - diagonal entries ( that is , higher values of @xmath42 ) , than those reported in sec .",
    "[ quantum ] , and/or possibly randomization procedures , as in sec .",
    "[ restricted ] .    at several points in this paper",
    ", we have indicated that the analyses of zhsl @xcite were `` over - parameterized '' , in that @xmath5 parameters were employed , rather than @xmath104 , as is clearly most natural for the @xmath10 density matrices ( which form an @xmath104-dimensional convex set ) . however , in a personal communication , m. byrd has asserted that this bothersome feature could be avoided , since @xmath105 euler angles ( in addition to the `` phase '' , as is well known ) can be seen to , in fact , vanish in the zhsl - type representation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 25 ) ) of a density matrix in the product form @xmath106 .",
    "byrd has been able to explicitly show this in the case @xmath20 , based on the euler angle parameterization given in @xcite ( the angles @xmath107 and @xmath108 vanishing ) and contends that analogous phenomena must hold for @xmath109 , as well ( cf .",
    "( this vanishing does not appear to occur with the particular euler angle parameterizations [ associated with hurwitz ] used by zhsl , given in @xcite .",
    "byrd suggests that this is because the `` diagonal matrices that make up the maximal torus '' do not appear on the end , while if they did , they would commute with the diagonalized density matrix . )",
