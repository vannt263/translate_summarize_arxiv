    "in searches for rare processes where there is no statistical evidence of the signal , it is often convenient to combine the results of more independent selection channels in order to obtain the upper limit to the number of expected signal events . a statistical procedure using a likelihood ratio approach has been adopted to combine the results of the higgs search done by the four lep experiments  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the likelihood ratio estimator @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the likelihood functions in the hypotheses of the signal plus background and background only respectively .    in the case of a poissonian sampling",
    ", only the number of events passing a number of independent selection channels is used as observable to discriminate the hypotheses of signal plus background versus background only .",
    "the likelihood functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be written , for the poissonian sampling , as the product of poisson probabilities : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of selection channels , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the expected number of signal and background events respectively and @xmath8 is the number of selected events .",
    "the following simplified expression for @xmath0 is more convenient for computer computations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 .    in the case where @xmath11 is the number of produced events and @xmath12 are the efficiencies of each selection @xmath13 .",
    "the absolute minimum of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath11 gives the most likely value of the branching fraction . in case",
    "there is no evidence of the signal , it is possible to compute an upper limit at a given ( usually 90% or 95% ) confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "using a toy monte carlo , generating a large number of random experiments for different values of the signal @xmath11 . the confidence level for the signal hypothesis",
    "can be computed as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number of the generated experiments which have a likelihood ratio less then or equal to the measured one , in the background plus signal and background only hypothesis respectively .",
    "background uncertainty can be included in the definition of the likelihood applying a convolution with the distribution of the background , which is given by the assumed distribution of the background fluctuation .",
    "the case where the error on the background estimates @xmath7 can be assumed to be poissonian has been studied in ref .",
    "in other cases , the uncertainty may be better considered as gaussian .",
    "this is true for instance when the background estimates are computed applying subtractions of different samples or applying scaling factors affected by gaussian uncertainties .    it should be remarked that the method applied in reference  @xcite , which is also applied in this paper , does not have as good formal basis as it was originally thought .",
    "reference  @xcite notes that the method is not correct from a frequentist point of view , nonetheless , it `` seems to be acceptable to many pragmatic frequentists '' .",
    "this caveat should be kept in mind when handling the results reported in the following .",
    "under the assumption that the uncertainties are gaussian , equations ( [ eq : lsb ] ) and ( [ eq : lb ] ) need to be convolved with a gaussian function , and become : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the error on the estimate of the background @xmath7 .",
    "the integration can be extended from @xmath20 to @xmath21 including the unphysical negative signal region when the area of the tails of the gaussian distributions in that region are negligible .",
    "this is true if @xmath19 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath7 . in that case , the integrals are easily manageable analytically .",
    "the integration can be performed exploiting the following expression for the exponent of the exponential term : @xmath22 the intagration variable can be normalized to @xmath23 so that the likelihood functions become : @xmath24 the integrals present in the likelihood functions are all of the form : @xmath25 and can be computed expanding the polynomial and using : @xmath26 or can be alternatively computed defining the @xmath27-th degree polynomials : @xmath28 it can be easily shown that the polynomials satisfy the recursion relation : @xmath29 the first polynomials are : @xmath30 the likelihood functions can be rewritten as : @xmath31 the computation of the upper limit with the toy monte carlo can be performed with a small modification to the code used for the computation in the case of no error .",
    "the following simplified expression for @xmath0 may be convenient : @xmath32    the usage of polynomials instead of other means of numerical integration provides a significant sepeed up of the code in computer calculations that use toy monte carlo .",
    "the above method has been applyied in the search for @xmath33  using in babar experiment  @xcite using the events where one @xmath34 meson is fully reconstructed , where the assumptions made in this paper hold .",
    "the search has shown no evidence for the signal . in order to evaluate the 90% c.l .",
    "limit on @xmath35  , a large number of toy monte carlo experiments have been generated for different values of the assumed branching fraction , each corresponding to an expected number of produced events @xmath11 .",

    "[ fig : cl2 ] show @xmath36 and confidence level as a function of @xmath35  with and without including the systematic error on the estimated background .",
    "the limit obtained including the uncertainty is less stringent than the limit obtained neglecting this effect .",
    "a procedure to include gaussian uncertainty on the background estimate for upper limit calculations using poissonian sampling has been presented .",
