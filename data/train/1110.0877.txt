    "this document is a supplement to our main article , in which we provide some of the details of the density functional theory ( dft ) and monte carlo ( mc ) calculations which were carried out to determine the most probable muon location sites in the dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 spin ice compound , as well as the associated internal magnetic field distribution .      to determine the quasistatic dipolar magnetic field which a positive muon experiences in the insulating dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 spin ice compound , one must first determine the most probable local minimum energy locations a muon occupies after coming to rest upon high ( 4.1 mev kinetic ) energy implantation in the sample .",
    "the standard expectation is that a positive muon ( a light version of proton ) forms a ( hydrogenlike ) bond with an oxygen at a typical distance of 1  . to address this question more quantitively , we determined those low - energy muon locations ( ground state and a few metastable states ) using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using the vasp package @xcite . in those calculations",
    ", one single positive muon was placed inside an 88-atom dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 supercell with periodic boundary conditions , which was neutralized by applying a uniform negative background charge .",
    "the valence wavefunctions were expanded in a plane - wave basis with a cutoff energy of 400 ev .",
    "a @xmath70 grid was used for the @xmath71-point sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functionals @xcite were used and all atoms in the cell were relaxed to minimize the feynman - hellmann forces to below 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the ground state as well as three other metastable higher energy states were identified , with their energy measured from the ground state labeled in fig .",
    "[ supfig-1 ] .",
    "the determined ground state as well as the identified metastable higher energy states of muon locations were taken as the most likely candidate for the muon locations in dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the internal magnetic fields at the muon sites due to the static dy@xmath4 magnetic moments were next calculated . to determine this field",
    ", we performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to sample the magnetic moment configurations at various temperatures .",
    "for these calculations , any local structural distortions of the original crystal caused by the presence of the muon were ignored in the mc .",
    "we considered the same extended dipolar spin ice model of dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 as in ref .",
    "[ ] with exchange interactions up to third nearest neighbors and long - range magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we employed a system size of 432 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dipole - dipole interactions among the dy@xmath4 magnetic moments as well as the local internal magnetic field at the muon sites determined by dft were calculated using the ewald summation technique .",
    "a loop update algorithm @xcite was employed to overcome the energy barriers of the single - spin - flip updates at temperatures below the schottky peak in the specific heat of dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , which occurs at a temperature @xmath72 k. at least 1000 mc steps with loop updates @xcite per spin were used in equilibrating the system .",
    "the sampling of the local dipolar magnetic field was done using 360,000 spin configurations .",
    "we assume that the time scale for the spin dynamics is , deep in the spin ice regime at low temperature ( @xmath73 ) , much longer than the muon lifetime and that the muons implanted homogeneously in the sample , one by one , experience static fields from these spin configurations with equal probability .",
    "no muon - dy@xmath4 transferred hyperfine field was taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "the probability histograms of the internal magnetic field at 200 mk are plotted in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ supfig-1 ] .",
    "the multiple peaked structures are a combined consequence of ( i ) of the discreteness of the ising spins and ( ii ) the fact that spin ices are not completely random as in an edwards - anderson spin glass , but rather , obey the two - in / two - out ice rules with the consequential dipolar correlations @xcite .",
    "one observes that the probability density for magnetic fields of order of hundreds of millitesla or higher is large at the lowest energy candidate muon sites determined by dft . as an independent check",
    ", we determined the internal magnetic field at the surface of a spherical shell of radius of 1    centered on oxygen locations and confirmed that such a magnitude of internal magnetic field is indeed typical .",
    "we also note that there is vanishing probability of @xmath74 mt for all muon locations .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ supfig-1 ] shows the zero field ( zf ) muon spin depolarization associated with the muon ground state ( curve labeled `` ground '' ) as well as the average relaxation for the ground state and the three lowest metastable states ( curve labeled `` 4 site average '' ) with initial muon polarization along [ 100 ] ( see main text ) .",
    "the fast oscillations of the muon polarization for short time ( @xmath75 @xmath0s ) with its rapid decay and asymptotic approach to a 1/3 value is again a reflection of the typical magnitude of the magnetic field a muon experiences , which is of order 100 mt .",
    "interestingly , the experimental @xmath0sr data do not find such `` front end '' oscillations , which should be observable given the time binning used in the data acquisition and the instrumental ( electronic ) timing resolution .",
    "this is possibly a result of the slight randomization of the local crystal field hamiltonian acting at the dy@xmath4 ions neighboring the implanted muon , and hence the corresponding weakly randomized magnitude of the dy@xmath4 magnetic moments  @xcite , as well as their direction and which we have ignored .",
    "another randomization which we have ignored is that of the transferred hyperfine field .",
    "finally , and most notably , these dft - mc calculations neglect the effect of dy@xmath4 spin fluctuations on the timescale of the muon lifetime @xmath1 perhaps the most significant new result of our experimental study and reported in the main part of the paper . indeed ,",
    "as observed experimentally , these have perhaps the most dramatic effect on the muon spin depolarization function .",
    "while all these effects which go beyond the approximations used here should ultimately be taken into account in future calculations , the results of such improved calculations will not affect our main conclusion .",
    "namely , the configuration of dy@xmath4 magnetic moments in dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 are sufficiently random , despite the ice - rule , that the likelihood that a finite percentage of muons land at sites with a local magnetic field negligible compared to the applied external field of 2 mt is for all practical purposes zero .",
    "ultimately , the experimental results reported in the main part of the paper corroborate this assertion : no weak tf precession signal whose origin is the dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 sample can be positively identified , confirming the above dft - mc calculations that there are no density of ( muon occupation ) states with local field of the order or less than the applied magnetic fields of order of 2 mt .",

    "<S> a large single ion anisotropy forces the moment to point strictly along local @xmath6 crystalline axes , along the line which connects the centers of the two adjoining tetrahedra and their common vertex , making the moments classical `` local '' ising spins . since ho@xmath4 and dy@xmath4 carry a large magnetic moment of @xmath7 , the dipolar interaction in these systems is @xmath8  k at nearest neighbor distance and of similar magnitude as the curie - weiss temperature @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frustration in spin ices stems from the @xmath10 long - range nature of the magnetic dipolar interaction and its consequential `` self - screening '' ( @xmath11 is the distance between ions )  @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> spin ices are frustrated ferromagnets with low - energy states characterized by two spins `` pointing in '' and two spins `` pointing out '' on each tetrahedron  the 2-in/2-out rule which defines minimum energy spin configurations . these map onto the allowed proton configurations in water ice which obey the bernal - fowler ice - rules  @xcite , hence the name spin ice .    </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar spin ice model  @xcite and its refinement @xcite yield an accurate microscopic quantitative description of the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of spin ices , both in zero and nonzero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the problem of the dynamical response of the moments in spin ices remains much less studied and understood . </S>",
    "<S> an exciting recent development in that direction is the realization that the `` 2-in/2-out '' spin configurations may be described via a divergence - free coarse - grained magnetization density field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a thermal fluctuation causing the flip of an ising spin from an `` in '' to an `` out '' direction amounts to the creation of a nearest - neighbor pair of magnetization source and sink on the two adjoining tetrahedra or , in other words , to the nucleation of `` magnetic monopoles '' out of the spin - ice - rule obeying vacuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting is the observation that monopoles in dipolar spin ice interact via an emerging coulomb potential which decays inversely proportional to the distance which separates them and are therefore deconfined  @xcite . a recent numerical study @xcite provides evidence that the temperature dependence of the relaxation time determined in ac magnetic susceptibility measurements  @xcite can be rationalized in terms of thermally activated monopoles , at least above  1 k. the wave vector dependence of the neutron scattering intensity suggests power law spin correlations , which are a prerequisite for monopoles with effective coulomb interactions @xcite . yet , </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the reported direct evidence for the presence of monopoles in spin ice and a determination of their effective charge is the most intriguing recent result @xcite .    in weak electrolytes , including water ice , characterized by a small dissociation rate constant @xmath12 , the so - called second wien effect describes the nonlinear increase of @xmath12 under an applied electric field . in a recent paper @xcite , bramwell and co - workers have drawn further on the analogy between magnetic moments in spin ice and protons in water ice  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite used @xmath0sr in a transverse - field ( tf ) geometry to determine @xmath13 and extract a value @xmath17  , close to the value @xmath18   anticipated by theory  @xcite .    in this letter , we discuss how the weak tf @xmath0sr experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as a means to observe the second wien effect in spin ice , was flawed in its conceptual design and execution and incorrect in its theoretical interpretation of the muon spin depolarization rate . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo calculations show that the internal magnetic field at the expected muon locations in dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 spin ice material is `` large '' ( @xmath19  t ) and has a broad distribution , preventing the observation of tf muon precession . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that the coherent muon precession in weak ( @xmath20  mt ) tf seen in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite originated rather from the sample holder and other parts of the sample environment . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our zero - field @xmath0sr results exhibit low - temperature muon spin relaxation which is temperature independent from 4 k down to 20 mk .    </S>",
    "<S> positive muons provide a pointlike real space magnetic probe averaging over the brillouin zone , in contrast with magnetization measurements , which measure only the q=0 response . in a @xmath0sr experiment , essentially 100% spin  </S>",
    "<S> polarized positive muons are implanted in a material and precess in the local magnetic field @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the muons subsequently decay ( with lifetime @xmath22 ) into a positron ( emitted preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay ) and two undetected neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> an asymmetry signal , obtained from the decay histograms of opposing positron detectors , represents the projection of the muon spin polarization function onto the axis defined by the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> since the muons are created fully spin polarized ( via the parity - violating weak decay of their parent pions ) , @xmath0sr experiments may be performed in zero ( zf ) , longitudinal ( lf ) or transverse ( tf ) magnetic field . as in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , the depolarization results from both dynamic ( @xmath23 ) and static ( @xmath24 ) processes . </S>",
    "<S> further details describing @xmath0sr are found elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) , @xmath26 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio times the rms instantaneous internal magnetic field at the muon site @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the field fluctuation rate . in the fast fluctuation ( @xmath29 ) regime , </S>",
    "<S> the envelope becomes @xmath30 whereas , in the slow fluctuation ( @xmath31 ) regime , the envelope reduces to @xmath32 , which is _ independent _ of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the relaxation in a transverse field ( tf ) never takes an exponential form where the relaxation rate @xmath33 , as assumed by bramwell _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . as discussed further below , </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is only applicable to zf and lf measurements . </S>",
    "<S> as the fluctuation rate of the electronic moments decreases and a significant spectral density develops near zero frequency , the local field at the muon site becomes the vector sum of the applied and internal fields . </S>",
    "<S> as we show , this net field in dipolar spin ice has a much larger rms value than the applied field @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the muon polarization function is not given by a cosine with a frequency corresponding to the applied field but , instead , is rapidly damped to zero .    from the discussion above </S>",
    "<S> , a crucial issue is whether the internal field distribution @xmath35 in a spin ice has significant weight below the applied external field of @xmath36 mt . as a first step to address this question , </S>",
    "<S> we use a loop algorithm @xcite in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a realistic microscopic model of dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite to calculate @xmath35 at the most probable muon locations , as determined by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the evolution of the tf depolarization rate tracks the magnetization  @xcite . </S>",
