    "recent improvements in the long - term precision of doppler - shift measurements @xcite resulted in several spectacular detections of planetary companions to solar - type stars .",
    "as such discoveries supply indirect evidence of the existence of extra - solar planets , other explanations of observed radial - velocity variations appeared , e.g. , stellar pulsations @xcite .",
    "the most recent results , however , show that only a planetary hypothesis is acceptable @xcite .",
    "the usual procedure showing that there exists a planet around s star consits of a direct least - square fit of keplerian model to the observations .",
    "it always gives certain values of orbital parameters and their formal errors . in the case of ` good ' data",
    "this is the best and the quickest way to obtain relable results .",
    "however , in the case of spare data with big errors one has to prove that the least - squares method can be used and that the obtained parameter values and their errors are good estimates of the real values .",
    "this is a difficult and time consuming task . without doubt",
    ", we have this situation with the doppler observation of extra - solar planets .",
    "we present an analysis of this problem and we show that the eccentricity of the fitted orbit is a very sensitive parameter and , in some cases , its value and error given by the least - squares method are not correct .    the aim of this paper is to show how the mentioned problem can be solved in practice .",
    "namely , we propose a method that can be very useful for analyzing radial - velocity variations .",
    "it is based on a simple idea involving the subsequent subtraction of periodic components from the data .",
    "this approach allows us to analyze the observations without assuming any specific model describing the system behavior ( like keplerian motion or stellar pulsations ) . after the determination of all significant components of the data , it remains to be decided",
    "which process is responsible for what we observe and whether it is possible to choose only one .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we analyse observations of 16 cygni b and we explain why the standard least - squere fit does not give reliable estimates of parameters and their errors . in section 3",
    "we analyze analytically the keplerian motion of the system ` a star with one planet ' in order to learn how its motion modulates the observed star radial - velocities .",
    "we investigate mainly the spectral properties of the motion which are essential for our method . in section 4",
    "we develop a simple numerical technique which can be used to extract all the information we need to compare with the results from section 3 . in section 5 , we perform a numerical test of the method using simulated radial - velocity variations with the orbital parameters of 70 vir @xcite . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the application of the method to finding the eccentricity of 16 cygni b @xcite .",
    "in order to determine the quality and reliability of the least - squares fit of a keplerian orbit to the radial velocity measurements of 16 cygni b performed by @xcite we analyzed the topology of the @xmath0 minimum on the @xmath1 plane , where @xmath2 is the semi - major axis and @xmath3 is the eccentricity . to this end , we used the real observations published in @xcite and the levenberg - marquard method to solve the nonlinear least - squares problem ( in our case a fit of a keplerian orbit ) which can not be linearized ( as this is the case for 16 cygni b observations , as we show below ) .",
    "we took the necessary fortran code from minpack library @xcite .",
    "as the semi - major axis and the eccentricity are the most crucial parameters of the model , we compute the behavior of @xmath4 on the @xmath5 plane . for a given point @xmath1 other parameters @xmath6",
    "are always chosen to correspond to the global minimum of @xmath0 , i.e. , for fixed values of parameters @xmath1 we make a series of fits with initial values of the elements @xmath6 covering their whole range and we take the smallest value of @xmath0 . in this way",
    "we get the behavior of @xmath0 on the @xmath5 plane , see figure [ 16cygbplan ] . as one can see the confidence levels @xmath7 of the parameters @xmath5 bound a large region of the parameters plane .",
    "this shows that @xmath3 is very weakly determined with the data available for 16 cygni b. at this point we make a well known but important remark .",
    "namely , as one can see in figure [ 16cygbplan ] , the confidence lines do not determine ellipses as it should be if we could use @xmath7 levels to determine the errors of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it also means that the errors of the parameters obtained from the linearized ( or not ) least - squares fit can not be treated as the correct estimates of the parameters accuracy .",
    "thus , for example , the value 0.082 from the paper of @xcite has little to do with the accuracy of the determined eccentricity .",
    "in fact , using nonlinear levenberg - marquard least - squares method we find a better solution for the same data of 16 cygni b ( this solution is marked with a filled square in figure [ 16cygbplan ] ; the filled star indicates the orbital solution found by @xcite ) .",
    "one can compare the @xmath0 behavior with a very similar picture obtained by means of the bootstrap method @xcite , see figure [ bootstrap ] . clearly",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is not normal .",
    "moreover , from this distribution we learn that any value of the eccentricity within the interval approximately @xmath8 is probable at the @xmath9 level .    to sum up , one can always use the least - squares method to obtain the orbital parameters .",
    "this method always gives a solution but sometimes the obtained parameters together with its errors have little to do with the real ones , whatever they are .",
    "however , the process of checking if the obtained result is correct is time consuming , and thus it seems resonable to find a simple method which can give the correct answer quickly .",
    "we address this problem in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "let us assume that we have a planetary system consisting of a star and one planet . choosing the reference frame placed in the center of mass of this system ( barycentric system ) with the @xmath10-th axis directed from the observer",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath10-th coordinate of the star from the following equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the star , @xmath13 is the mass of the planet and @xmath10 is its @xmath10-th coordinate .",
    "next , because of the keplerian motion of the system , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 are keplerian elements of the planet ( semi - major axis , inclination , longitude of periastron and eccentricity ) and @xmath16 is its eccentric anomaly that can be calculated from the kepler equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean anomaly , @xmath19 is the orbital period of the planet and @xmath20 is the time of periastron .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that function ( [ t:1 : : ] ) can be expanded in the following series @xmath21 where @xmath22 +   { { \\rm i } } s [ j_{k - 1}(ke ) + j_{k + 1}(ke ) ] \\right\\ }   { { \\rm e } } ^{-{{\\rm i } } knt_{p}},\\ ] ] and @xmath23 in the above @xmath24 is a bessel function of argument @xmath25 .",
    "this expansion has a very important property ",
    "terms corresponding to successive harmonics have decreasing amplitudes . in this way",
    ", the term with the frequency @xmath26 has a larger amplitude than that with frequency @xmath27 , which has larger amplitude than that with frequency @xmath28 , etc .",
    "generally , it is possible to prove the following inequality @xcite @xmath29 for each @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; in ( [ t:5 : : ] ) we denote @xmath32 ^ 2                                           + [ j_{k+1}((k+1)e)]^2 }                  { \\beta^2\\tan^2\\omega[j_{k}'(ke)]^2                                          + [ j_{k}(ke)]^2 } } , \\ ] ] and @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 only the first term with frequency @xmath26 has a non - zero amplitude .",
    "these considerations allow us to state the following : keplerian motion of the planet orbiting a star leads to specific changes in the @xmath10-th coordinate of a star .",
    "these changes have a very characteristic spectrum in which the term with frequency equal to the mean motion of the planet @xmath26 is dominant and amplitudes of subsequent harmonics ( with frequencies @xmath35 ) decrease strictly monotonically .",
    "the expansion of the keplerian motion we show above can be easily applied to calculate the radial velocity of the star resulting from its motion in the system . having the expansion of the @xmath10-th coordinate of the star , we derive its radial - velocity by differentiating ( [ t:4 : : ] ) with respect to time @xmath36 as it can be easily noticed , the above expansion has the same feature as the expansion of the @xmath10-th coordinate .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath37 of two successive harmonics is always less than 1 , since we have @xcite @xmath38 thus , all useful properties of the radial velocity expansion can be derived from that of the @xmath10-th coordinate .    in summary ,",
    "if we observe radial - velocity variations that are of planetary origin then in their spectra we will detect the basic frequency corresponding to the planet orbital period and its harmonics with monotonically decreasing amplitudes .",
    "the ratios of successive harmonics depend on the value of the eccentricity and the longitude of periastron .",
    "it means that in the case of a circular orbit we will be able to notice only one periodic term ( which is obvious ) and with increasing eccentricity the number of detectable harmonics will increase .",
    "finally , we should mention that , because of the finite accuracy of our observations , we can only detect a few higher harmonics . thus , from the observational point of view , expansion ( [ t:6 : : ] ) is always finite and includes the basic term ( corresponding to the planet orbital period ) and a few of its harmonics .",
    "let us note that we can examine characteristic features of the spectra of other processes ( e.g. stellar pulsations ) and compare them with the expansion of keplerian induced radial - velocity variations .",
    "such information might be crucial for the proper interpretation of observations .",
    "let @xmath39 denote a set of radial velocities of a star obtained from the doppler - shift measurements . using the least - squares method",
    ", we fit the function @xmath40 to the data . as the first approximation of @xmath41 ,",
    "we take the frequency corresponding to the maximum of the lomb - scargle periodogram of @xmath39 @xcite .    at the @xmath42-th stage of this algorithm",
    ", we have a set of the residuals @xmath43 obtained by fitting function @xmath44 to the original observations , where @xmath45 this means that at the @xmath42-th stage of the algorithm we have the following model function @xmath46 : @xmath47 then , using the periodogram of @xmath43 , we approximate @xmath48 , and we fit function @xmath49 to the original set of radial - velocities .",
    "these steps are repeated until the desired number of terms is obtained or until the final residuals are smaller than the assumed limit .",
    "we call the above algorithm _ unconstrained frequency analysis _ , as we assume that all frequencies we find are independent",
    ". however , we can modify our method to the constrained form . to this end , we assume that all terms have frequencies that are natural combinations of the chosen basic frequency @xmath50 @xmath51 thus the model we fit to the observations has the form @xmath52 in this way parameters of the model are @xmath53 and not @xmath54 ; @xmath55 .",
    "we call this version of the algorithm the _ constrained frequency analysis_.    numerical tests of this method can be found in @xcite and its successful applications to the psr  b1257 + 12 pulsar timing observations in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we show how this method works on a simulated set of radial velocity measurements .",
    "for the purposes of this example , we have chosen the orbital parameters of 70 vir @xcite .",
    "they are presented in table 1 where we also present several periods and corresponding amplitudes calculated from expansion ( [ t:6 : : ] ) . for our tests , we computed data that are very similar in nature to the real observations .",
    "thus we have 39 unevenly sampled radial - velocities .",
    "we also added 10 ms@xmath56 gaussian noise resembling the real observational error .    in figure [ fa70vir ] we present results from the unconstrained frequency analysis for the data described above .",
    "what can we learn about the planetary system from these results ?",
    "first , we notice that the eccentricity of the orbit of 70 vir is large since we are able to detect three periodic terms in the data .",
    "in fact , from the ratio of the amplitudes of the basic term to its first harmonic , we can precisely calculate the eccentricity ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "let us assume now that we do not know that these radial - velocity variations are of planetary origin .",
    "from the unconstrained frequency analysis for 70 vir we find out that there are three periodic terms detectable , and , up to the accuracy of the method , they are all natural combinations of a certain basic frequency .",
    "this basic frequency corresponds to the term with the largest amplitude .",
    "it means that in fact , we see effects from the basic frequency and its two subsequent harmonics .",
    "moreover , the ratio of their amplitudes resembles a process of planetary ( keplerian ) origin .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that there are other reasonable processes that can produce such spectra and in this way mimic a planet .",
    "thus , taking into account all the facts , the most natural answer would be that we observe radial - velocity variations induced by a planet in an eccentric orbit .    in summary ,",
    "frequency analysis can supply us with strong constraints on the possible models of observed radial - velocity variations and verify the orbital solution obtained from a least - squares fit .",
    "we should also notice that we can apply the constrained frequency analysis as well ; it usually results in a better fit and can be used to obtain better approximations of values of the amplitudes and basic frequency . finally , one can compare this result with the behavior of @xmath0 in figure [ 70virplane ] .",
    "the comparison shows that in many cases the frequency analysis will not be superior to the least - squares fit but will give an idependent insight into the data .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to use both methods while analyzing radial velocity measuerements , as the frequency analysis is numerically not demanding and has the capablility of confirming the least - squares findings .",
    "we should also mention that it is possibible to interpret the observations in a different way which might be as well justified as the original assumption .",
    "namely , it is possible to show that in some cases a planetary system consisting of two ( or more ) planets can be misinterpreted as one planet in a highly eccentric orbit and vice versa .",
    "this is easily understandable since from the frequency analysis we know that an eccentric orbit just produces a finite set of harmonics in the real data which subsequently might be interpreted in different manners . as there are some difficulties with the explanation of the existence of planets with highly eccentric orbits ( see the paper of @xcite and reference therein for a discussion of this topic ) and there is no obvious reason why the planets discovered around the solar - type stars should be the only ones in their systems the above idea might be worth checking .",
    "we applied the frequency analysis to real observations of 16 cygni b. according to @xcite the planet is believed to move in an highly eccentric orbit ( e=0.634 ) .",
    "we calculated theoretical amplitudes of the first harmonics of expansion ( [ t:6 : : ] ) , presented in table 2 . for calculation we took the orbital parameters obtained by means of the least squares method by @xcite . comparing the values of amplitudes from table 2 and the mean error of observations we concluded that we could detect at least the main frequency @xmath26 and its harmonic @xmath27 .",
    "we performed the frequency analysis of the real observations and we were only able to detect the basic frequency corresponding to the orbital period ( see figure [ fa16cyg ] ) .",
    "after the subtraction of this term , there were no other dominant frequencies present in the data .",
    "thus , our result obtained with the help of frequency analysis was inconsistent with result of @xcite who reported the eccentricity 0.634 with uncertainty 0.082 .",
    "this is , however , consistent with the results from section 2 .",
    "stricly speaking , the frequency analysis reveals that the current quality of the data available for 16 cygni b does not allow us to determine the eccentricity of the orbit due to the absence of any harmonics and confirms the findings based on the @xmath0 topology and the bootstrap method for these observations .",
    "the final conclusion is that the real error of the eccentricity is much greater than that reported by the least - squares method , making the determination of the eccentricity of 16 cygni b almost impossible .",
    "this fact can be easily derived from the frequency analysis .",
    "the absence of any harmonics just indicates that the eccentricity must remain undetermined . with the frequency analysis one",
    "gets this correct result without the time consuming @xmath0 map or the bootstrap method .",
    "in this paper we have shown that results obtained from least - squares fits of keplerian orbits to real doppler - shift measurements may lead to incorrect interpretations .",
    "specifically , they may give unrealistic or even entirely false values of parameters and their uncertainities . in order to solve these problems",
    "we have proposed a new method , frequency analysis , which efficiently provides an independent test of the reliability of determined orbital parameters .",
    "this method may deliver a substantial revision of the current values of planets high eccentricities that are essential for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "it might even lead to hints that some of the observed high eccentric planets are in fact planetary systems consisting of more than one planet or at least provide an independent point of view on the same data .",
    "these facts , together with the ease of applicability of frequency analysis , make our method worth trying on future observations if not for the data already gathered .",
