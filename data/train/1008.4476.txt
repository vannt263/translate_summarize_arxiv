    "the thermodynamics of fission products in uranium dioxide has been a focus of considerable experimental and theoretical attentions in nuclear industry .",
    "xenon as the most important fission gas is one of them .",
    "concern has been particularly centered on xenon s role in fuel _",
    "swelling_that could increase the pressure on the cladding of the fuel rod under irradiation and lead to rupture .",
    "a similar risk also exists for the container of nuclear waste in storage conditions .",
    "this has accordingly led to a desire to obtain a greater understanding of the basic processes governing the migration and trapping of xenon within the fuels.@xcite    previous theoretical studies on xenon behavior employed interatomic potentials such as shell model.@xcite this method provided qualitative understanding of gas properties . however , since shell model has severe transferability difficulty,@xcite the reliability of its results requires further verification by other methods .",
    "application of quantum mechanics to this problem was available only recently and focused mainly on single gas atoms that occupying point vacancies and schottky sites.@xcite in uranium dioxide , however , oxygen defect clusters dominate and the interplay of them and fission gases might be the key to correctly understand the subtle material behavior .",
    "for example , in hyper - stoichiometric regime of uo@xmath2 where @xmath3 , oxygen self - defect cluster ",
    "the cub - octahedron ( cot ) cluster dominates when temperature is relatively low.@xcite there is a big cavity at the center of cot , which can either be empty ( denoted as cot - v ) , or be filled by additional oxygen and forms cot - o cluster , or be filled by xenon atom and becomes cot - xe .",
    "furthermore , existence of cot - v and cot - o clusters changes the concentrations of all other defect traps that the gas atoms can incorporate with .",
    "such kind of direct and indirect effects of oxygen clusters have not yet been investigated .",
    "big cavity also can be found at uranium vacancy or tri - vacancy ( tri - v , a kind of bound schottky ) .",
    "we will show that xenon atoms are prone to occupying these traps and become xenon - trap aggregates .",
    "this incorporation behavior not only reduces elastic strains that imposed on the bulk matrix but also changes the development of intra - granular bubbles , and thus is possible to alleviate the fuel swelling that suffered from fission gases .",
    "energetics of xenon in defective uo@xmath4 was modeled in a @xmath5 supercell consisting of eight fluorite cubic unit cells .",
    "periodic boundary conditions and the density functional theory in local spin density approximation with hubbard correction to the on - site coulombic repulsion of the localized uranium 5@xmath6 orbitals ( lsda+__u _ _ ) were employed to compute the total energy.@xcite all structures were fully relaxed until residual forces less than 0.01ev /  .",
    "details of the computational setup and the validation of the method are referred to refs .",
    "particularly the lsda+__u _ _ approach has been applied to perfect@xcite and self - defective@xcite uo@xmath4 successfully , and yielded results in good agreement with experiments .",
    "oxygen defect clustering and the relevant thermodynamics have also been well described by this method.@xcite    in next section we will discuss a solution to the notorious meta - stable states problem that frequently encountered in dft+__u _ _ applications .",
    "this approach was developed in our previous calculations.@xcite though it lacks a rigorous theoretical basis and can not guarantee that the true ground state can always be achieved , we found that it is effective to reduce the frequency of encountering high - lying meta - stable states and thus improves the reliability of the computational results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ef ] and [ sec : es ] a systematic analysis of the electronic structure and energetics of xenon atoms that incorporating in nuclear fuels will be given , as well as the influence of oxygen defect clustering on the incorporation energies , the solution energies and the relevant thermodynamics of xenon gas",
    ". in section [ sec : comp ] a comparison with other theoretical results will be discussed , followed by a summary .",
    "dft+__u _ _ formalism improves the performance of density functional theory on strongly _ correlated _ electronic system by including a hubbard correction to the on - site coulombic repulsion in a semi - empirical manner .",
    "the cost is , however , introduced a lot of _ local minima _ on the energy surface that obstructing energy minimization process , and making electronic optimization algorithms get stuck in meta - stable states .",
    "monitoring the occupation matrices ( mom ) of the localized @xmath6 orbitals can solve this problem partially by varying their initial values to search for the lowest state.@xcite but this option is not generally available in most dft packages .",
    "also the approach is a try and error method , which can not ensure that the global minimum has already been obtained before all possible occupation matrices have been tried .",
    "another concern about mom is the computational cost .",
    "if spin degree is not considered , there are @xmath7 different ways of filling @xmath8 electrons in seven @xmath6 levels diagonally .",
    "the number of different nondiagonal occupation matrices is much larger , but we can reduce it to several times of the number of the diagonal case by assuming that all other occupations are insignificant .",
    "thus for each atom there are @xmath9 different ways to fill the @xmath6 levels , with @xmath10 less than ten .",
    "it is also the total number of the runs that are required for each calculation if the simulation cell contains only one symmetry inequivalent atom .",
    "unfortunately the symmetry of defective system is usually low , and has several non - equivalent atoms ( say , @xmath11 ) with localized @xmath6 electrons . in such a case a total number of @xmath12 runs are necessary for each calculation . for uo@xmath4",
    ", @xmath8 equals 2 and @xmath10 can take 3 , thus gives about 60 different occupation matrices for each uranium.@xcite if point defects are concerned , there are at least two non - equivalent uranium atoms , and the number of the total runs would increase to 3600 . for defect clusters , @xmath11 should be greater than 3 and it requires millions of runs for each calculation to get the final result .",
    "this is a huge burden even for modern supercomputers .    in a classical system",
    ", the meta - stable states difficulty can be tackled satisfactorily with _ annealing _ procedure .",
    "namely , to remove the thermal kinetic energy of a system gradually and slowly so that all low - lying states have been visited before picking out the ground solution .",
    "similar concept can be applied to electronic system .",
    "the basic idea is to shake or heat the electronic system with a spurious energy noise to help it overcome the energy barriers .",
    "we call this method the _ quasi - annealing _ ( qa ) procedure .    , 4@xmath13 , 5 , thus circumvents possible meta - stable states on the original route .",
    ", width=2 ]    the theoretical basis is that the electronic energy is a functional of the electron density @xmath14 , which is in turn a unique functional of the external potential @xmath15 .",
    "one can then convey the spurious noise from the ionic subsystem to the electronic subsystem via @xmath15 .",
    "it amounts to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluctuation of the external potential . by switching off this spurious energy gradually",
    ", one can extract the ground state in a similar way as its classical counterpart .",
    "alternatively , we can understand the mechanism of removal of the meta - stable states in qa procedure by tracking the electronic minimization process : the potential fluctuations alter the minimization path iteratively , thus being capable of avoiding any possible meta - stable states that lying on its route , as illustrated in figure [ fig : qa - draft ] .    in practice",
    ", one might exploit the _ residual energy _ of the minimization process .",
    "the energy uncertainty @xmath18 due to non - convergence of the self - consistency field ( scf ) gives a quasi - random fluctuation in ionic forces , which in turn leads to a gaussian distribution of the ions with respect to their physical positions .",
    "the potential fluctuation @xmath19 arising from this ionic drift eventually _ heats _ the electronic system up .",
    "generation of @xmath19 from the forces can be done with standard structure optimization algorithms .",
    "that is , one iteratively relaxes the ionic structure with an electronic state having a scf tolerance of @xmath18 . in this realization ,",
    "the only one parameter ",
    "the residual energy in scf  controls the spurious noise in the electronic system",
    ". its value should be large enough at the beginning so that the electronic system can travel freely in the phase space . by decreasing @xmath18 gradually",
    ", one converges the electronic system down to the ground state .",
    "the merits of qa are not just that it can be used to tackle the meta - stable states . by coupling with ionic relaxation",
    ", one can optimize the electronic and ionic states simultaneously .",
    "it reduces the total computational cost dramatically when structure optimization is also required , especially when dft+__u _ _ formalism is employed where the scf convergence is very slow . to avoid ions drifting too far away from the target configuration",
    ", one needs to restore the structure after some ionic steps . usually allowing cell volume and shape to vary improves the performance , because it not only extends the searching space , but also shakes the system globally and breaks the _ symmetry _ imposed by the bravais lattice , which is one of the main reasons that lead to high - lying meta - stable states in strongly correlated system.@xcite       and the performance of quasi - annealing procedure , which predicted the lowest total energy .",
    ", width=3 ]    the qa procedure is summed up as follows , where in each step the computation restarts from the wave - function that was generated in its previous step:@xcite    1 .",
    "switch off symmetry , set appropriate values for scf tolerance @xmath18 and ionic relaxation step size @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   employ standard ionic optimization algorithms to evolve the structure .",
    "3 .   reduce @xmath18 and @xmath20 slightly , restore the structure , goto step 2 and repeat the procedure until @xmath18 reaches the target precision .",
    "4 .   conduct a standard scf iteration .",
    "5 .   slightly distort the structure , goto step 2 and repeat the whole process until no lower state can be found .",
    "at first we discuss the performance of qa in a perfect fluorite cubic cell of puo@xmath4 ( with 12 atoms ) that ordering in 1**k * * antiferromagnetic configuration with gga+__u _ _ method .",
    "the paw pseudo - potentials and pbe exchange - correlation functional were used .",
    "the hubbard parameters were 4.0ev for @xmath1 and 0.7ev for @xmath21 .",
    "a cutoff of 400ev was adopted for the kinetic energy of the plane wave basis , and 63 irreducible _ k_-points were used to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "the lattice parameter was fixed at 5.45 .",
    "it should be pointed out that this setup was only for puo@xmath4 .",
    "all the following defects calculations were conducted with lsda+__u _ _ method as detailed in sec.[sec : intr ] .",
    "here we chose puo@xmath4 because this system has very stable meta - stable states .",
    "for example if the cubic symmetry ( @xmath22 ) is imposed onto the system , one always obtains a meta - stable state having a total energy of @xmath23ev , no matter what the initial condition of the calculation is .",
    "this is different from uo@xmath4 where the symmetry - induced meta - stable state can be removed easily . in puo@xmath4 , however , one has to switch off the symmetry in order to get rid of this state .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : qa - puo2 ] , switching off the symmetry lowered the energy by 1.69ev .",
    "but this is far from being the ground solution .",
    "adiabatically switching on the hubbard on - site interactions , namely , increasing the @xmath1 and @xmath21 parameters from zero slowly , further reduced the total energy about 0.16ev . the qa procedure ,",
    "in contrast , predicted a much lower energy . a total number of six independent qa runs were performed .",
    "the results were similar and the standard deviation @xmath24 ( scattering of the data ) was 0.006ev . on the other hand ,",
    "direct scf calculations have a standard deviation of two orders larger than qa .",
    "this suggests that the electronic system has gotten rid of high - lying states and converged closely to the ground solution in qa .",
    "the best result we ever had is @xmath25ev .",
    "it is helpful to compare qa results directly with mom .",
    "we thus performed a gga+__u _ _ calculation on perfect uo@xmath4 with the same setup as in ref .",
    "the only difference is that we used a 500ev cut - off energy for the plane - wave basis set and a 5@xmath265@xmath265 _ k_-point mesh instead of the 600ev cut - off and the 6@xmath266@xmath266 _ k_-point mesh that were used in that work .",
    "this difference should have little influence on the final result since the total energy has already been converged well with this setting of parameters .",
    "after a fully relaxation of the ionic structure , qa gave a total energy of @xmath27ev , lower than mom s @xmath28ev for fluorite structure and @xmath29ev for jahn - teller distorted geometry ( see table in ref .",
    "we can not state that qa outperforms mom , but it is obvious that an incomplete implementation of mom as done in ref .",
    "[ ] does not necessarily lead to a ground state solution .",
    "figure [ fig : quasi - ann ] demonstrates the improvement of qa procedure against direct scf calculations for a set of defects in uo@xmath4 , including point oxygen interstitial , oxygen vacancy , uranium vacancy , split quad - interstitial , xenon atom that incorporated in a tri - vacancy site , and cot - o cluster .",
    "we found that direct scf calculations always stopped at high energy states , with an energy distance about 0.3ev to the qa results , regardless of the defect type .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that these direct scf calculations were performed on structures that already optimized by qa procedure , and the cubic symmetry of the lattice had been switched off .",
    "one interesting example is about the stability of oxygen defect clusters .",
    "_ did lsda+__u _",
    "_ calculations on the stability of defect clusters in uo@xmath4 without qa treatment.@xcite the results were controversial : they predicted that the split quad - interstitial ( @xmath30 - 3o@xmath31)@xmath4 had an energy lower than cot - o cluster . here",
    "we denote the split quad - interstitial by the symbol ( @xmath30 - 3o@xmath31)@xmath4 because it is actually a linear combination of two basic clusters@xmath30 - 3o@xmath31 , an oxygen vacancy surrounded by three willis o@xmath31 interstitials.@xcite a careful re - computation of the energetics of these two clusters with qa procedure , however , gave a different picture .",
    "we found that andersson _",
    "_ s energy of ( @xmath30 - 3o@xmath31)@xmath4 was almost the same as qa .",
    "but their value of cot - o was much higher than that of qa ( in terms of formation energy with respect to the same reference state , @xmath32ev _ vs. _ @xmath33ev ) .",
    "a direct scf run with qa - optimized structure led to a meta - stable state with an energy of 0.16ev higher than that of qa , and was much lower than andersson _",
    "s original result .",
    "a re - check calculation using the same setup as theirs also failed to reproduce their results . according to the variational principle of energy",
    ", we guess that their calculation of cot - o cluster might have stopped at a meta - stable state .",
    "unfortunately we can not identify it without reproducing their electronic state successfully .",
    ", where the qa results are at the zero level .",
    "all direct scf calculations were performed using the fully relaxed structures.,width=3 ]    now we have two approaches that can tackle meta - stable states , _",
    "i.e. _ , mom and qa . in the case of perfect uo@xmath4 ,",
    "though primary mom calculations did not predict a lower state than qa , it does not mean qa truly achieved the ground state .",
    "we know that annealing procedure does not perform well when there are a lot of local minima that have the same amplitude and the same width .",
    "thus it can not state that the meta - stable states problem has been solved satisfactorily by qa .",
    "however , qa is effective to remove high - lying meta - stable states and to bring the system down to one of the low - lying states that have small amplitude . from the experience of mom,@xcite we estimate the absolute error in qa might be less than 0.1ev .",
    "the relative energy difference between systems would be much better and at an order of @xmath34 due to error cancelation . in practice",
    ", qa is an effective method to reduce data scattering and to improve the reliability of the calculated energetics .    in brief ,",
    "when the system is small and the computer resource is enough so that allowing to repeat the calculation many times , mom is a good choice . with this method",
    "one can get explicit information of how the meta - stable states distribute . on the other hand ,",
    "qa optimizes ionic and electronic degrees simultaneously .",
    "thus if atomic structure optimization is desired , qa would outperform mom , especially for large systems .",
    "all of the following calculations have been treated by qa procedure to improve the reliability of the results .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    there were several dft calculations on the incorporation behavior of xenon in uo@xmath4 published recently.@xcite it is valuable to summarize these results and compare with our calculations .",
    "the results of dft calculations and those computed using semi - empirical shell model potentials@xcite are listed in table [ tab : inc - e ] .",
    "these data are scattered , but a common trend is obvious . all calculations that conducted at different theoretical levels predicted that the lowest incorporation energy for xenon is at the tri - vacancy site , and the highest energy is at the octahedral interstitial site , which is then followed by the oxygen and the uranium vacancy sites . only the gga results of ref .",
    "[ ] predicted a different order .",
    "its xe(u ) has an incorporation energy as high as 13.9ev .",
    "this might originate from size effect since they employed a small supercell containing only 12 atoms . in a recent gga calculation using a larger supercell containing 96 atoms,@xcite this value",
    "was reduced to 6.04ev and became qualitatively consistent with other calculations .",
    "in addition , there is a digital scattering with a magnitude of 1@xmath352ev in these dft results .",
    "this might be due to the different methodologies that were employed , for example the different exchange - correlation functionals , the constraints on structure optimization process , the effective hubbard parameters , and so on .",
    "meta - stable states might also play some role here .",
    "the incorporation energies of xenon calculated by nerikar _ _ et al.__@xcite are 1@xmath352ev higher than ours , except that at uranium vacancy where their value is about 1ev smaller . as for the solution energies , they predicted the stability of xenon at tri - vacancy in the hypo - stoichiometric regime with a solution energy of 3.88ev , about 2ev smaller than ours .",
    "this is because though we have a similar binding energy for point defects to form a tri - vacancy , our formation energies of individual point defects are higher than theirs . in hyper - stoichiometric regime , they and we both predicted that uranium vacancy is the favored site for xenon at low temperatures .",
    "again our value is about 2ev higher . without considering oxygen clustering and finite temperature effects , nerikar _",
    "et al . _ failed to notice the variation of the solution energy with temperature and the thermodynamic competition among tri - vacancy , uranium vacancy and other possible complex traps ( _ e.g. _ , di - vacancy ) , which we have shown are important for understanding the physical behavior of realistic nuclear fuels .",
    "with lsda+__u _ _ calculations , the incorporation behavior of xenon atoms at various trap sites in uo@xmath4 was analyzed by studying the electronic structure and energetics . in the regime of uo@xmath36 ,",
    "the result was that the gas atom prefers to tri - vacancy sites , while in uo@xmath2 uranium vacancies are favored .",
    "cot clusters have large enough space at their centers but are not occupied by xenon atom due to subtle electronic de - hybridization of o @xmath37 and u @xmath38 orbitals when xenon atom goes in and the central oxygen out .",
    "the calculated solution energies showed that a thermodynamic competition between xe(u ) and xe(tri - v ) is significant , and the indirect influence of oxygen clustering is important . at uranium vacancy site ,",
    "xenon is ionized to xe@xmath0 state , confirmed early semi - empirical prediction .",
    "this kind of charge transfer indicates that xenon bubbles can not initiate from uranium vacancies but neutral tri - vacancy sites .",
    "thus one can tune the occupation probability of xenon at tri - vacancy sites and then the bubble growth rate by control temperature . a approach to solve the meta - stable states difficulty that frequently encountered in dft+__u _ _ applications",
    "was proposed , which exploits the coupling between ionic and electronic sub - systems and uses a quasi - annealing procedure to relax the electronic system to the ground state .",
    "it was shown that this method can effectively avoid meta - stable states .",

    "<S> the observation that gas atoms are ionized to a charge state of xe@xmath0 when at a uranium vacancy site due to strong madelung potential implies that one can control temperature to tune the preferred site of gas atoms and then the bubble growth rate . a solution to the notorious meta - stable states difficulty that frequently encountered in dft+@xmath1 applications , namely , the quasi - annealing procedure , is also discussed . </S>"
