    "the lensing geometry that we will consider is portrayed in figure [ lens ] .        in an expanding universe in order to obtain the impact parameter @xmath6 , we should evaluate the expression for the angular distance , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( actually , the small angle approximation @xmath9 is good for redshifts @xmath10 ) .",
    "in parsecs as a function of redshift with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13.__,width=264,height=340 ]    figure [ angdist ] shows us that the maximum distance between the two photon paths leads to the constraint @xmath14 so it will be necessary to place enough density inside a tube of that radius to obtain enough lensing .",
    "next we will calculate that density by looking at the equations for lensing by a filament .",
    "if we assume that the dark matter tube has a gaussian density distribution of width @xmath4 and central density @xmath15 then the lensing angle for a photon passing at a distance @xmath16 from the centre of the tube is given by @xcite ( newton s constant @xmath17 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass per unit length of the tube .",
    "this equation is only valid when the length of the tube @xmath20 .    equating @xmath21 with the lensing angle @xmath22 and assuming the relationship @xmath23 then we have an expression for the minimum density of the object @xmath24 and now we need to find out if this density is reasonable in terms of the densities that we would expect for wimp halos as calculated from the power spectrum .",
    "to find out the maximum possible density of a candidate filament , we will have to make a key assumption .",
    "we are suggesting that a dark matter halo may be disrupted into a stream of matter during a tidal encounter with another halo .",
    "since we have no indication of exactly what kind of interaction that may be , we will have to assume that the typical density of the tube of dark matter is approximately the same as the halo which was disrupted to create the tube .",
    "having made this assumption , then we should calculate the typical densities that we expect dark matter halos to have . in order to do this",
    ", we have to take into account that smaller wimp halos typically form at earlier times and have larger densities corresponding to the higher average density of matter during those epochs .",
    "we will calculate the mass - density relationship for halos using the toy model presented by bullock et al @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the typical virial mass @xmath25 of halos which collapse at a redshift @xmath26 is the mass which solves the equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a parameter derived from n - body simulations and @xmath29 is the critical over - density for the collapse of a spherical shell in a matter dominated universe . likewise",
    "the characteristic density @xmath30 of a dark matter halo which collapses at a redshift @xmath26 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given for a flat universe by @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "since we will be considering halos which collapse at redshifts @xmath35 where radiation and acceleration are irrelevant , we will assume that @xmath36 , then following the fits of @xcite for simulations of halos in a @xmath37 universe we assume that @xmath38 so that @xmath39 so that now we must work out the rms magnitude of perturbations for different mass scales @xmath40 .",
    "in order to obtain @xmath40 , we need to assume an adiabatic cdm evolution for the perturbations , so that the transfer function between the primordial fluctuations and those at late times goes like @xmath41^{-1/4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 when the effect of baryons is not taken into account @xcite . including baryons we use a version of @xmath43 which takes into account baryonic suppression on small scales @xcite @xmath44}.\\ ] ] we define @xmath40 to be the rms density fluctuation on the scale encompassing a mass @xmath45 , given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the top hat window function and @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the spectrum is normalised by setting @xmath50 then if we set @xmath13 we find that @xmath51 .",
    "again referring to the numerical fits of @xcite we take the fraction in equation ( [ f ] ) to be given by @xmath52 and then we obtain the results plotted in figure [ densfig ] .",
    "pc@xmath53 _ , width=340,height=264 ]    the results in figure 3 tell us that more massive halos have a lower characteristic density and that lower mass halos all have a similar characteristic density , around @xmath54300 m@xmath55pc@xmath53 .",
    "this gives us our maximum density for the lensing object @xmath56 equation ( [ boz ] ) then tells us exactly what the radius of the tube needs to be for a given density , so that we now have a minimum radius for the tube .",
    "@xmath57 so that structure formation theory has given us an upper limit on the typical density ( and it _ is _ greater than the lower limit ) that we might expect for a wimp halo , and therefore a minimum radius and mass that we would require if we were to try and use such a halo as our lens candidate .",
    "in order to find out if the density predicted by structure formation theory is large enough to explain the lensing event we have made some assumptions .",
    "one should of course perform computer simulations to find out how the density changes before and after the halos are stretched into filaments via tidal distortion . here , as a first approximation , we will assume that the density of the filament of dark matter is equal to the density of the halo with the same total mass as the filament .",
    "this will probably overestimate the density of the filament .",
    "next we will assume that the length of the tube is twice its diameter , i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 this seems the minimum assumption that we would require since the result ( [ boz ] ) is valid only if the impact parameter of the photons @xmath60 .",
    "we can calculate the density that would be required in order to explain the lensing using @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the required density is then given by @xmath63 and we plot @xmath64 as a function of mass in figure [ compare ] vs. the density - mass relation for halos we get from structure formation ( we know the lensing angle @xmath65 from the observation ) .",
    "figure [ compare ] shows us that in order to try and explain the lensing via a wimp halo , we should consider higher masses .",
    "this is at first perhaps slightly surprising , since we have shown that the density of wimp halo _ decreases _ at higher densities , but a moment s thought tells us that @xmath66 , so the dependence on density is actually weak .",
    "it is therefore clear from figure [ compare ] that in order to explain the lensing using a wimp halo , we would have to consider one with mass @xmath67 .",
    "since it is difficult to imagine how such a halo could exist without having significant numbers of baryons in it , these results make it difficult to reconcile the non - observation of a lensing candidate in the data @xcite with the idea of dark matter being responsible for the lensing .",
    "there are two caveats to this logic which should be mentioned here .",
    "the first is that the most up to date simulations of dark matter halos show that they have a very cuspy centre , and unlike the gaussian we used in equation [ boz ] , their inner profiles go like @xmath68 with @xmath69 @xcite . in principle",
    "this effect could be used if the impact parameter @xmath16 was much less than the cross sectional radius of the tube @xmath4 , although it seems unlikely that the central density of the dark matter tube would remain as cuspy after tidal disruption .",
    "the second possibility is the use of dark matter caustics which can come in various shapes including tubes .",
    "however , more detailed analysis shows that it is unlikely caustics can create an observable signal , even at high redshifts @xcite ( although see @xcite ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have tested the hypothesis that the csl-1 lensing candidate could be explained via lensing due to a tidally disrupted halo of dark matter .",
    "we have shown that such a halo would probably have to have a mass bigger than the milky way , and since we see no such object in the csl-1 field , we can neglect this possibility .",
    "the simplest explanation for the observation is of course that the two images are two separate galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "if this turns out to not be the case , we will certainly have an intriguing mystery on our hands .",
