    "this article describes a combinatorial way to reconstruct a tiling space and its groupoid , using bratteli diagrams . in a forthcoming paper , this description will be used for tilings given by multi - substitutions @xcite .",
    "given a repetitive , aperiodic tiling @xmath0 with finite local complexity ( flc ) in @xmath1 , its tiling space @xmath2 , or hull , is a compact space obtained by taking a suitable closure of the family of tilings obtained by translating @xmath0 . by construction , the translation group @xmath1 acts on @xmath2 by homeomorphisms making the pair @xmath10 a topological dynamical system .",
    "it is well known that repetitivity ( or _ uniform repetitivity _ , as it is called in the symbolic one - dimensional case ) is equivalent to the minimality of this action , see  @xcite .",
    "equivalently , this dynamical system can be described through a groupoid @xcite , denoted by @xmath11 , called the _ crossed product _ of the tiling space by the action .",
    "if the tiles of @xmath0 are punctured , the subset of @xmath2 made of tilings with one puncture at the origin of @xmath1 is a compact subset @xmath3 called the _",
    "canonical transversal _ @xcite . for quasi - crystals",
    "this identifies with the so - called _ atomic surface _",
    "it has been shown that flc implies that the transversal is completely disconnected @xcite , while aperiodicity and minimality eliminate isolated points , making it a cantor set .",
    "similarly , there is an _ tale _",
    "groupoid @xmath12 associated with it @xcite , which plays a role similar to the poincar first return map in usual dynamical systems .",
    "this groupoid is defined by the equivalence relation @xmath4 identifying two tilings of the transversal differing by a space translation .",
    "while the existence of the hull does not require much information , it can be quite involved to have an effective description which allows computations .",
    "the first step in this direction came from the work of anderson and putnam for substitution tilings @xcite .",
    "a substitution is a rule describing how each tiles , after suitable rescaling , is covered by other tiles touching along their faces .",
    "the most publicized example is the penrose tiling in its various versions , like kites and darts @xcite .",
    "anderson and putnam built a @xmath6-complex @xmath13 of dimension @xmath14 , with @xmath14-cells given by suitably decorated prototiles and showed that the substitution induces a canonical map @xmath15 .",
    "then the hull can be recovered as the inverse limit @xmath16 .",
    "this construction has several generalizations for repetitive , aperiodic , and flc tilings without a substitution rule , see  @xcite .",
    "it is proved that there is a sequence of finite @xmath6-complexes @xmath17 of dimension @xmath14 and maps @xmath18 so that the hull is given by the inverse limit @xmath19 .",
    "it is even possible to choose these @xmath6-complexes to be smooth branched manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the first goal of the present paper is to describe the construction of a bratteli diagram from these data in section [ bratteli09.ssect-brat ] .",
    "a bratteli diagram is a graph with a marked vertex @xmath20 called the _",
    "root_. the set of vertices @xmath21 is graded by a natural integer , called the _ generation _ , so that @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath25",
    ". then edges exist only between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the present construction , each vertex in @xmath26",
    "is given by a @xmath14-cell of @xmath28 .",
    "then there is an edge between a vertex @xmath29 and @xmath30 if and only if the @xmath14-cell @xmath31 can be found inside @xmath32 .",
    "each edge will be labeled by the translation vector between the puncture of @xmath32 and the one of @xmath31 inside @xmath32 .",
    "namely at each generation @xmath33 , the bratteli diagram encodes how a @xmath14-cell of @xmath34 is filled by @xmath14-cells of @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely it encodes not only which cells in @xmath28 occur but also their position relative to the @xmath14-cell of @xmath34 . as in @xcite , since the family @xmath17 is not unique , there are several choices to build a bratteli diagram associated with a tiling space .",
    "conversely , starting from such a bratteli diagram , a tiling can be described as an infinite path starting from the root .",
    "such a path describes how a given patch at generation @xmath33 , is embedded in a larger patch at generation @xmath35 . by induction on the generations ,",
    "an entire tiling is reconstructed .",
    "in addition , the origin of the tiling is defined uniquely at each step , thanks to the label of the edges involved . if each patch involved in the construction is decorated by its _",
    ", namely provided that the tiling _ forces its border _ in the sense of @xcite , the tiling obtained eventually covers @xmath1 , even if the origin is at a fixed distance from the boundary of the patch , because the collar , beyond this boundary , increases in size as well . as a result the transversal @xmath3 is recovered , as a compact topological space , from the space of infinite rooted paths in the diagram ( theorem [ bratteli09.thm-isotrans ] ) .    in a bratteli diagram ,",
    "the _ tail equivalence _ identifies two infinite paths differing only on a finite number of edges ( definition [ bratteli09.def-afer ] ) .",
    "it gives rise to a groupoid called the _ af - groupoid _ of the diagram . in the language of tiling spaces ,",
    "this groupoid describes the translation structure inside the tiling , up to an important obstacle .",
    "namely , a tiling built from an infinite path with the origin at a fixed distance from the boundary of the corresponding patches can not be identified , modulo the tail equivalence , with a tiling built from a path with origin at a fixed distance from the same boundary but located on the other side of it . as a result",
    ", a tiling obtained in this way will be subdivided into regions , that will be called _ af - regions _ here ( definition [ bratteli09.def-afregion ] ) , separated by boundaries .",
    "note that matui has found similar features for a class of @xmath36-dimensional substitution tilings in @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the groupoid of the transversal @xmath12 ( definition [ bratteli09.def-gpd ] ) allows to identify two such regions through translation . so that recovering @xmath12 from the bratteli diagram requires to change the definition of the tail equivalence .",
    "the present paper offers a solution to this problem by adding a _ horizontal structure _ to the diagram making it a _ collared bratteli diagram _ ( definition [ bratteli09.def-cbrat ] ) .",
    "its aim is to describe in a combinatorial way , from local data , how to locate a tile in a patch , relative to its boundary .",
    "practically it consists in adding edges between two vertices of the same generation , describing pairs of tiles , in a pair of patches , each in the collar of one another ( see figure [ bratteli09.fig-horizontal ] ) .",
    "these edges are labeled by the translation between these tiles . in other words ,",
    "the horizontal edges describe how to glue together two patches in a tiling across an af - boundary .",
    "then it becomes possible to extend the tail equivalence into an tale equivalence relation on the collared bratteli diagram ( definition [ bratteli09.def-eqrel ] and theorem [ bratteli09.def-etale ] ) in order to recover the groupoid of the transversal ( theorem [ bratteli09.thm-eqrel ] and corollary [ bratteli09.cor-groupoid ] ) , with the af - groupoid as a sub - groupoid ( remark [ bratteli09.rem-afcomp ] ) .    in the particular case of @xmath37-dimensional tilings ,",
    "this larger equivalence relation is generated by the af - relation and finitely many pairs of minimal and maximal paths in the diagram , which are derived from the collared diagram in a natural and explicit way ( proposition [ bratteli09.prop-1d ] ) .",
    "the examples of the fibonacci and thue - morse tilings are illustrated in details in section  [ bratteli09.sect-examples ] .",
    "this study of @xmath37-dimensional tilings also allows to view the paths whose associated tilings have their punctures at a minimum distance to an af - boundary ( corollary [ bratteli09.cor-fsigma ] ) as generalizations of extremal paths for @xmath37-dimensional systems .",
    "this work gives one more way of describing tilings or their sets of punctures , and their groupoids , liable to help describing various properties of tiling spaces , such as their topology or their geometry .",
    "it benefited from almost thirty years of works with original motivation to describe more precisely the properties of aperiodic solids .",
    "in particular the notion of hull , or tiling space , was described very early as a fundamental concept @xcite encoding their macroscopic _ translation invariance _ , called homogeneity .",
    "see for instance @xcite for reviews and updates .    during the eighties , the discovery of quasicrystals @xcite was a landmark in this area and stimulated a lot of mathematical works to describes this new class of materials @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was very convenient to represent the structure of these materials by various examples of tilings , such as the penrose tiling or its @xmath38-dimensional analogs @xcite .",
    "it was shown subsequently @xcite that such structures are liable to describe precisely the icosahedral phase of quasicrystalline alloys such as .    in the end of the eighties , connes attracted the attention of mathematicians to the subject by showing that the penrose tiling was a typical example of a noncommutative space  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that already then , connes used a bratteli diagram to encode the combinatorics of patches between generations .",
    "its is important to realize , though , that the construction given by connes was based on the _ substitution _ proposed originally by penrose @xcite but ignored entirely the additional structure given by space _",
    "translations_. in the context of the present paper , including the translations is the key reason leading to the extension of the @xmath5-relation .",
    "this leads to a non-@xmath5 @xmath39-algebra instead , a difficulty at the source of so many works during the last twenty years .",
    "bratteli created his diagrams in @xcite to classify @xmath5-algebras , namely @xmath39-algebras obtained as the unions of finite dimensional @xmath39-algebras .",
    "it took two decades before it was realized that , through the notion of _ vershik map _",
    "@xcite such diagrams could encode any minimal homeomorphism of the cantor set @xcite .",
    "the corresponding crossed product @xmath39-algebra was shown to characterize the homeomorphism up to orbit equivalence .",
    "this classification was a natural extension of a similar problem for ergodic actions of @xmath40 , a problem solved by krieger and connes within the framework of von neumann algebras ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "this program was continued until recently and lead to the proof of a similar result for minimal actions of @xmath41 on the cantor set @xcite .",
    "in particular , as a consequence of this construction , giordano  matui  putnam  skau proved that any minimal @xmath41-action on the cantor set is orbit equivalent to a @xmath40-action @xcite .",
    "moroever , the groupoid of the transversal of every aperiodic repetitive flc tiling space is orbit equivalent to a minimal @xmath40-action on the cantor set @xcite .",
    "as it turns out the formalism described in the present work is similar to and , to a certain extend inspired by , the construction of _ refined tessellations _ made by giordano _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the section  [ bratteli09.sect-tilgpd ] contains the basic definitions about tilings , groupoids , and the constructions existing in the literature required in the present work .",
    "section  [ bratteli09.sect-gpdbrat ] is dedicated to the definition and properties of the bratteli diagram associated with a tiling .",
    "the main reconstruction theorems are reproduced there .",
    "the last section  [ bratteli09.sect-examples ] illustrates the construction for @xmath37-dimensional substitution tilings , and treats the two examples of the fibonacci and thue  morse tilings in details .",
