    "the quest for a complete understanding of the true nature of neutrino masses and mixing in the neutrino sector of the standard model ( sm ) is one of the most important challenges that physicists have to face in the coming years .",
    "perhaps the experimental difficulties involved in the study of neutrino properties can be best appreciated noticing that only very recently the neutral partner of the tau lepton , the tau neutrino ( @xmath3 ) , has been directly observed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , after decades of experimental efforts there is finally some evidence for neutrino oscillations  @xcite and thus the first indications of the fact that neutrinos might not be massless particles as advocated by the sm .",
    "even so , it is not clear at present whether these neutral fermions are of dirac or majorana type ( for a dirac neutral @xmath4 while for a majorana @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is well known that if neutrinos are of the majorana type then the lepton number ( l ) is not conserved and processes which violate l by two units @xmath6 become possible .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting lepton number violating processes is the neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath7 which currently provides the most stringent bound on the _ effective light _ majorana mass @xmath8 .",
    "extensive literature is available on this subject both from the experimental and theoretical sides . in view of the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) to be built at cern which will realize proton ",
    "proton collisions at energies of @xmath9 it will be of increasing importance to study quark reactions which are the high  energy analogues of the @xmath7 .",
    "this was realized already some time ago and has been the object of several studies of the signal ( lepton number violating ) reaction : @xmath10 any model with lepton number violation ( i.e. due to the presence of massive majorana neutrinos ) will provide a non zero amplitude for the process in eq .",

    "[ qqbaranni ] . in a series of recent papers  @xcite",
    ", the present authors have addressed the question of lepton number violation within a composite model scenario where the partner of the light neutrino , the so called excited neutrino , @xmath1 , is assumed to be of a majorana type .",
    "the phenomenological implications of this idea have been investigated in detail both with respect to the low  energy decay and to the high  energy lsd signal in hadron collisions .",
    "in particular , in @xcite we developed a helicity amplitude method to efficiently compute all @xmath11 parton subprocesses that contribute to the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ process4o ] ) . the cross ",
    "sections were estimated to lead , within some regions of the parameter space , to an observable signal .",
    "one particular advantage of the approach developed in  @xcite is that it gives the possibility to treat coherently the two mechanisms of ww  fusion and resonant production ( annihilation channel ) .",
    "clearly such an approach can be extended to explore the phenomenology of other models that entail l violation . in the event of observation of such a signal , it will be important to know the contribution to it of the various models beyond the sm and ultimately , a way to distinguish among them to understand the responsible mechanism .    in this work , the model of",
    "heavy isosinglets majorana states that mix with ordinary light lepton via a left - handed coupling suppressed by a mixing coefficient , is assumed and studied in detail .",
    "while completing this work a report  @xcite appeared in the literature which also commented upon the same model of heavy majorana neutrinos by studying the resonant production at lhc via the third order process @xmath12 and arriving at somewhat optimistic results as to the possibility of observing the signal .",
    "the process in eq .",
    "( [ process3o ] ) is described by the feynman diagram obtained by that of fig .",
    "[ qqbaranni ] but without including the hadronic decay products of the final _ on - shell _ w. however , the method used here of evaluating analytically all the relevant amplitudes , as developed in  @xcite , is totally independent of that of the authors of  @xcite which relies on the comphep  @xcite package .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives a description of the theoretical framework ; in section iii the amplitudes of the contributing subprocesses are presented ; in section iv an exact analytic result is provided for the process in eq .  [ process3o ] highlighting differences with the formula reported in  @xcite and discussing thoroughly how the conclusions reported there are affected ; section v presents some discussion of kinematic cuts and gives some details of the numerical calculations along with the results ; finally section vi provides concluding remarks .",
    "the mixing of heavy and light neutrinos is a common feature of many theoretical models beyond the sm .",
    "heavy majorana neutral leptons have been well studied in the literature in particular from a model which is the sm augmented with additional right  handed neutrino fields . in this scenario , that can be seen as a low - energy manifestation of @xmath13 gut theories  @xcite , one has the following mass term for neutrinos : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are vectors in generation space with components given by three chiral fields : @xmath17 and a mass matrix given by @xmath18 in general an arbitrary number of right  handed neutrinos can be added , but for definiteness and simplicity the most symmetrical case is considered ( i.e. that of three right - handed fields ) . the mass matrix is then @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the @xmath21 matrix of dirac type masses for neutrinos that is built via the spontaneous symmetry breaking and yukawa couplings as for charged leptons and quarks , while @xmath22 is the majorana @xmath21 mass matrix for singlet right  handed fields .",
    "if one requires the eigenvalues of @xmath22 to be much bigger than those of @xmath20 , diagonalizing the mass term one has a three generation `` see - saw ''  @xcite model , with three light and three heavy majorana mass eigenstates .",
    "weak interactions produce weak eigenstates that are superpositions of mass eigenstates through the mixing matrix .",
    "as opposed to the naive one family `` see  saw '' mechanism , where @xmath23 , with three generations ( or more ) of right  handed neutrino fields , it is possible to decouple the magnitude of the mixing coefficient of heavy - light states from the mass eigenvalues of @xmath22 , and the mixing angles can be treated as phenomenological parameters bounded only by existing experimental data .",
    "examples of mass matrices that satisfy this request are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context ,",
    "lepton number violation in @xmath24 collisions was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "some authors refer instead to other theoretical scenarios @xcite derived from super - string inspired @xmath25 models . here",
    "global symmetries imposed on the mass matrix decouple the mixing angles from any relation with masses eigenvalues , so that they are free parameters that can be large ( as in multi - generational `` see  saw '' type models ) . some caution however must be paid in deriving heavy majorana masses in these models where every family of the sm is enlarged both with a right - handed field and a singlet field @xmath26 in the neutrino sector .",
    "the mass term for neutrinos in the lagrangian is  @xcite : @xmath27 where the mass matrix is given by : @xmath28 where again the fields represent a collection of three chiral fields and the block @xmath29 and @xmath30 are dirac type sub - matrices .",
    "the zeros are consequence of the global lepton number conservation imposed on the mass matrix .",
    "the spectrum that one obtains through diagonalization is three massless neutrinos and three heavy dirac neutral leptons  @xcite .",
    "therefore these type of models can not be the base for the discussion of the lepton violating processes that are the object of this work .",
    "one could add a majorana mass matrix , @xmath31 for @xmath26  @xcite ( lower left @xmath32 block in the mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ mass99 ] ) ) , and obtain a small majorana mass for the light neutrinos , but the heavy states remain dirac particles .",
    "thus in this class of models it is not very easy to obtain heavy majorana masses ( in the tev range ) with substantial heavy - light mixing .",
    "independent of theoretical prejudices , in the following the general interaction lagrangian between charged leptons , neutrinos , and gauge vector bosons of the sm is given within this class of models where the weak eigenstate neutrinos are combinations through the mixing matrix of light and heavy _",
    "physical _ neutrinos .",
    "so the latter have the usual left - handed coupling with leptons with a coupling constant that is the sm weak coupling @xmath33 multiplied by the appropriate element of the mixing matrix .",
    "the charged and neutral current interaction lagrangian densities are given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a @xmath36 rectangular mixing matrix that can be written @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the two @xmath32 block matrices that give the light - light and light - heavy mixing , while the @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the properties of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the known experimental constraints on mixing angles .",
    "as these heavy states have not yet been observed , light - heavy mixing has to be inferred by low  energy phenomenology . in  @xcite",
    ", a global fit is performed on lep data identifying the following effective mixing angles : @xmath45 that are bounded from above as : @xmath46 the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have performed an updated analysis finding roughly the same value for the bound on the electron parameter @xmath47 but a somewhat more stringent bound on the muon mixing parameter @xmath48 , thereby making the electron lsd channel the most interesting .",
    "however for first generation leptons it is necessary to consider bounds coming from non observation of neutrinoless double beta decay ( see below ) . in the next sections calculations",
    "are reported for the first family ( @xmath49 ) lsd signal under the assumption that : @xmath50 ) only one heavy majorana eigenstate is exchanged ; @xmath51 ) the maximum allowed value for the mixing can be used for the relative element of the mixing matrix , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "it should be recalled that when extensions of the sm are embedded in more general theories , one needs to consider new gauge bosons that can interact with the heavy neutrino states . however , as these bosons are predicted to be very heavy , their interactions are suppressed relative to those of the sm so that one can safely neglect them  @xcite in the following discussion .      before entering into the detailed calculations , a comment is in order , regarding violation of unitarity , and the bound coming from the non observation of neutrinoless double beta decay  which is quite important .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the basic process @xmath53 or , equivalently , @xmath54 intervening in the reactions discussed in the present work ( see fig .  [ wwfusion ] ) , violates unitarity unless the following condition is satisfied : @xmath55 in the model considered here this is automatically satisfied as it is easily shown that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the left - majorana mass matrix ( @xmath32 block matrix ) of @xmath58 , and this is zero as can be inferred from the mass matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) .",
    "the majorana mass term of @xmath58 could be different from zero within a higgs triplet model which however has been excluded by the precision lep data , unless one considers somewhat more contrived models , where , for example , the higgs triplet is mixed with a singlet allowing to evade the lep bounds  @xcite . in the following such eventualities are not considered , the absence of a higgs triplet is assumed , ensuring thus the unitarity condition to be satisfied according to eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) .",
    "the non observation of the neutrinoless double beta decay ( a second order weak nuclear decay ) gives the following bound on the _ effective inverse mass _",
    "@xcite : @xmath59 within the rather reasonable hypothesis that only the light mass eigenstate contributes significantly to both the low - energy  process and high - energy ( lsd ) signal and using @xmath60 one easily finds a rather impressive lower bound on the mass  @xcite : @xmath61 this of course would preclude the possibility of producing such particles at any forthcoming hadron or lepton collider . the bound could obviously be evaded as the mixing coefficients appear as squared and not through their moduli squared in eq  ( [ boundbb ] ) . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite several scenarios of mixing are discussed where cancellations between different terms arise thus evading the bound .",
    "explicit examples are provided  @xcite but of course the resulting models appear somewhat fine tuned and/or too much contrived and un - natural .",
    "it would then appear that a phenomenological analysis of the processes discussed in the introduction would be pointless for heavy neutrino masses within the mass range @xmath62 .",
    "however , one can build models which do not suffer such drawbacks of fine tuning and unnaturalness by simply assuming that the heavy majorana neutrinos do not have the same cp parities ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this was done by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who considered a model with two degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos of @xmath64 tev and opposite cp parities that evades the bound  @xcite .",
    "it is within such a scenario that the following phenomenological study of the processes in eq .",
    "( [ process3o ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ process4o ] ) has to be understood . in any case",
    "it must be kept in mind that the predictions reported here are based on the maximum experimentally allowed mixing and therefore new global fits on the last lep data may lower its value , and thus affect the present conclusions .",

    "notice that from theoretical arguments  @xcite it can be stated that a forward  backward symmetry should show up in processes of production of heavy majorana through cp conserving interactions like that here considered . figs .",

    "a difference is found relative to the numerical results reported in ref .",

    "[ fig6 ] one can observe that for relatively low neutrino masses the two leptons are emitted preferentially parallel to each other while at high neutrino masses the distribution tends to become flatter .    the opposite behaviour is instead predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see their fig .  5 ) .",
    "this can again be explained assuming the interpretaion given above of the calculation reported in  @xcite .",
    "the absence of the ghost particles amounts to the absence of the longitudinal polarization of the w - gauge boson ( @xmath171 ) : so the w gauge boson would have only the two helicity states @xmath172 .",
    "suppose a head - on collision between a @xmath173 and @xmath174 with @xmath175 along the positive direction of the @xmath176 axis .",
    "as @xmath177 has @xmath178 and @xmath174 has @xmath179 , the initial total angular momentum is @xmath180 . to conserve angular momentum along the @xmath176 axis , the only allowed configuration in the final state , composed of the two identical leptons and an on - shell @xmath181 , is with a w - gauge boson with @xmath182 and the two positrons emitted with opposite momentum ( antiparallel ) , since the two leptons have the same helicity , to give @xmath183 .",
    "if we start with @xmath184 we have an initial @xmath185 , so the final @xmath181 has @xmath186 and the two leptons are again emitted antiparallel . however in reality",
    "the w - gauge boson has also the longitudinal polarization and the @xmath171 possibility is also present : when this is so , the two leptons must be parallel to give @xmath187 .",
    "this additional helicity amplitude prevents the angular distribution to drop as @xmath188 .",
    "the other distributions discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( c.f .  transverse w - mass , transverse w - momentum and invariant mass @xmath189 ) are confirmed by the present calculations and so are not repeated in this report .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the angular distribution with respect to the opening angle of the jets in the fourth order process .",
    "it is worth noticing that the w - angular - distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , is more strongly peaked along the collision axis than that of the leptons , fig .",
    "thus the jets that originate from its decay are expected to be emitted preferentially along the collision axis and parallel to each other .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the parton level simulation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . if one takes into account that in the hadronization process more than two jets may be present ,",
    "it is clear that the mass reconstruction of the w may not be so easy from the experimental point of view .",
    "the peculiar characteristics of the signal are : two like sign leptons with the same angular and transverse momentum distributions , no missing energy , and at least two jets with an invariant mass distribution peaked at the w mass while the invariant mass distributions in the @xmath190 system will be peaked at the heavy neutrino mass , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "clearly no sm process have these features but some have final states with accompanying neutrinos ( missing energy ) which are a source of potential background to the lsd + 2jets signal .",
    "all previously cited literature considered only heavy quark ( @xmath191 , @xmath192 ) production and subsequent decay as a major source",
    ". however recent simulations  @xcite have recognized that more dangerous background at lhc can be single top production and gauge boson pair production ( wz and zz ) followed by leptonic decays . after all cuts ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the authors find a background of @xmath193 events with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb @xmath157 that implies a total cross @xmath194 fb .",
    "this would restrict the observability of the signal studied here in the neutrino mass range @xmath195 gev .",
    "however the kinematic cuts used here are softer than those used for the sm background suppression in ref .",
    "@xcite , so it is interesting to understand if the conclusions above can be significantly affected by changing the kinematic cuts . in  @xcite is indicated that at least a cut of @xmath196 gev on @xmath197 is necessary to suppress the sm background ( also an isolation cut is needed but this will not affect the signal significantly ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the dashed curve shows the effect on the signal of increasing the cut on the @xmath197 up to @xmath196 gev : the total cross ",
    "section is lowered by a factor of up to an order of magnitude in the region of low neutrino masses , but it is practically unchanged in the high mass region .",
    "the drastic change in shape found at small masses can be qualitatively understood by noticing that when @xmath122 is small a larger part of the energy goes into @xmath198 mass leaving not much kinetic energy for the outgoing particles , so a high cut on @xmath199 naturally lowers the cross  section .",
    "this is in agreement with the lepton transverse momentum distributions ( which are not reported here as they are the same of those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : these are peaked at @xmath200 . clearly",
    "a cut of @xmath201 gev on @xmath197 cuts away most of the events when @xmath202 gev , thus causing a drastic change in @xmath203 .",
    "however it should be remarked that also within these strong cuts there still remain a measurable number of events .",
    "this paper has addressed the lepton number violating processes @xmath159 @xmath204 and @xmath82 @xmath205 within the scenario of models where heavy majorana neutrinos mix with light leptons . in particular regarding the fourth order process @xmath159 explicit analytic expressions of the helicity amplitudes are provided for the two competing mechanisms : the ww - fusion and the resonant neutrino production .",
    "these helicity amplitudes might also be useful for more realistic ( detector dedicated ) monte carlo simulations and/or within the scenario of other models beyond the standard electroweak theory .",
    "with respect to process @xmath82 a detailed study , both analytical and numerical , with a thorough comparison to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , has been performed finding some differences in the analytical formula of the matrix element which have been explained by noticing that the formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite does not include the ghost contribution needed in the feynman-t hooft gauge .",
    "however , as important as this might be , the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the size of @xmath203 ) is only affected by an error of @xmath206 , though relevant differences are found on some of the angular distributions .",
    "in particular the distribution in the opening angle ( @xmath207 ) of the two leptons ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) is found to be significantly different from that reported in  @xcite .    according to the study presented here in the framework of the mixing model of heavy left ",
    "handed neutrinos there is a mass range of up to @xmath208 gev where the cross  section would be in principle observable ( @xmath209 event per year assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath210 fb@xmath157 ) .",
    "this window in the heavy neutrino masses is drastically reduced down to @xmath211 gev taking into account the recent sm background estimates quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath212 events / year with an integrated luminosity of @xmath210 fb@xmath157 ) , which appears to be dominated by the production of double gauge bosons and single top .",
    "the observation of the lsd signal , in this model , is thus ultimately related to the size of the mixing angle and the possibility of suppressing the sm background .",
    "if a like sign di - lepton signal will be seen at lhc , then the question of determining the underlying physics scenario , that triggers the non sm signal , would immediately arise ; more realistic , detector dedicated , monte carlo simulations would be needed and , of course , this eventuality would require additional theoretical work .",
    "it is the authors belief that the present work would in any case be of importance in this direction .    c.  c. acknowledges support of an infn grant ( pg-102061/2000 ) that allowed his stay in perugia .",

    "( [ effmix ] ) .",
    "the total decay width is given by @xmath220 the factor of two in eq .",

    "the formulas that reproduce the widths given in  @xcite , as explained in the text , are obtained using t hooft - feynman gauge but _ without _ including the goldstone boson contribution , which amounts to use for the sum over the real w polarizations : @xmath224 , i.e. that corresponding to a massless gauge boson .",
