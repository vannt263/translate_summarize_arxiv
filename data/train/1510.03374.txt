    "classical wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars display powerful , radiation - driven winds which are ejecting copious quantities of mass .",
    "these stars spectra are dominated by strong emission lines of ionized carbon ( the wc subtype ) or nitrogen ( the wn subtype ) , while helium lines are ubiquitous in all wr stars .",
    "the winds peeling away of the outer layers of wr stars initially reveals the products of hydrogen burning ( especially ionized nitrogen ) in the wn stars , followed by the products of helium burning ( carbon and oxygen ) in the wc stars .",
    "this simple but elegant picture of massive star evolution , reviewed in detail in @xcite , predicts that there should exist a short - lived transition state between the wn and wc stages , when the emission lines of carbon and of nitrogen are visible simultaneously .",
    "these stars are thus valuable as laboratories where the last traces of the hydrogen burning products are being stripped to reveal the outer layers of helium - burning .",
    "transition stars are designated as wc / n or wn / c , depending on the overall appearance of the emission - line spectrum ; the element with stronger lines appears first @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite explored the effects of semi convection , varying spin rates , metallicity and mass loss rates on the relative lifetimes and expected numbers of wr stars of different subtypes .",
    "the thickness of the transition zone , and hence the time during which a star displays both wn and wc characteristics , is predicted to increase with increasingly effective semi convection and more rapid rotation .",
    "the wn / c lifetime is predicted to decrease with increasing metallicity ( and hence mass loss rate ) , as these strip away the transition zone faster .",
    "the observed number of transition wn / c stars relative to all wr stars is thus an important constraint and test of the predictions of the models of the late evolutionary stages of massive stars evolution .",
    "it is observed that the rarest of all wolf - rayet stars are the wo subtypes @xcite , with nine currently known , closely followed by the transition types .",
    "only 12 of the latter are known in the milky way , the lmc , smc , ic10 and m33 @xcite out of a total of about 600 wr stars with spectra of quality high enough to distinguish their transition nature .",
    "this rarity , corresponding to about 2% of all wr stars , empirically demonstrates that the transition time from wn to wc must be short - of order 10,000 years @xcite .",
    "the first narrowband imaging surveys for m31 wolf - rayet stars began three decades ago , looking for stars displaying strong emission lines of ionized helium , nitrogen and carbon @xcite .",
    "currently the most sensitive and complete survey s @xcite estimate of the population of m31 wolf - rayet stars is 154 , with 62 spectrographically - confirmed wc stars and 92 of type wn .",
    "this is far fewer than the @xmath0 wr stars currently known in our own galaxy , which in turn is probably only @xmath1 of the milky way s total population @xcite ( but see a lower estimate from @xcite ) .",
    "not a single wn / c transition star has been reported in m31 , while one might have expected 2% @xmath2 154 stars @xmath3 stars to have been found .",
    "this total lack of m31 wn / c stars might be due to the high metallicity of m31 s stars , or simply due to small number statistics .",
    "we report , here , the first transition wr star to be detected in m31 , demonstrating that at least one such object does , in fact , exist there .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data and their reductions .",
    "the coordinates , images , observed and dereddened spectra , and classification of the new m31 wr transition star are presented in section 3 .",
    "we contrast and compare it with other wr transition stars in section 4 , and briefly summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the wr star discussed in this paper was found as a  by - product \" of a spectrographic survey of m31 aimed at detecting and characterizing symbiotic stars ( syst ) in that galaxy .",
    "candidate syst ( and the wn / c star that is the focus of this paper ) were chosen because they displayed strong h@xmath4 emission in images of the publicly - available lggs survey @xcite , and because they are quite red ( @xmath5 ) . while all syst display a strong h@xmath4 line , they have little or no emission in the familiar forbidden lines of , , and @xcite . instead , they show lines of high ionization potential such as .",
    "the spectra themselves were obtained with the hectospec multi - fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt telescope @xcite .",
    "the hectospec 270 gpm grating was used and provided spectral coverage from roughly @xmath6 at a resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the observations were made on the night of 17 november 2014 , and were reduced in the uniform manner outlined in @xcite .",
    "the frames were first de - biased and flat fielded .",
    "individual spectra were then extracted and wavelength calibrated .",
    "sky subtraction is achieved with hectospec by averaging spectra from `` blank sky '' fibers from the same exposures or by offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds .",
    "standard star spectra obtained intermittently were used for flux calibration and instrumental response .",
    "these relative flux corrections were carefully applied to ensure that the relative line flux ratios would be accurate .",
    "the total exposure time was 5400 s.    archival images of the field of the new wr star were downloaded from mast , the mikulski archive for space telescopes , at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the field was observed for program 9794 ( pi : massey ) on 2 december 2003 through multiple filters with the hubble space telescope s wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys .",
    "we also downloaded images of the lggs from the lowell observatory s website , and carried out aperture photometry of every star in every image .",

    "the 5808  line strength of m31 84 - 1 is similar to those of the transition stars wr8 , wr 98 and wr 153 , while its emission lines are stronger .",

    "these values are consistent with typical magnitudes of wc6 and wn5 stars .",
    "we note that there does remain the possibility that this star is a binary , composed of wc6 and wn5 components .",
    "figure 1 shows that the angular separation of such a binary must be less than 0.1  , corresponding to almost 0.4 pc at the distance of m31 .",
    "time resolved spectroscopy might show the carbon and nitrogen lines changing their radial velocities in phase ( cf wr 145 = mr 111 @xcite ) , proving that the new wr star is a transition wr object in a binary .",
    "alternately , the carbon and nitrogen lines might move out of phase , proving that we have detected a binary wr star with two wr components .",
    "no radial velocity shifts of either element s lines would be indeterminate , consistent with a single transition star , or a very long period binary wr star .      in fig .",
    "[ profile ] we show the profiles of the strong emission line 4686 and the region around h@xmath4 , scaled vertically so that their maxima overlap .",
    "the helium line has a fwzi of 4000 km / s , typical of wr stars .",
    "this 4000 km / s fwzi is matched and confirmed by that of the 5411 ( see table1 ) , demonstrating that blending from other lines is not the cause of the large fwzi .",
    "the emission line of h@xmath4 is much narrower than the helium 4686 and 5411 emission lines , as are the flanking lines of that are present .",
    "this , together with the other narrow balmer lines , and the equally narrow and lines , which all show fwhm around 500 km / s ( see table 1 ) , demonstrates that the wr star is immersed in a gas of low density and moderately high excitation . while it is possible that part of these narrow emission lines are diffuse interstellar gas , we note that in fig .",
    "[ fc ] , ( where the wn / c star labelled wr is clearly seen to be in emission ) , the star is unresolved in the narrowband f658n and f502n filters , relative to nearby stars , which do not show similar emission .",
    "we also see no trace of diffusive emissivity beyond the radius of the point - spread function of the wr star .",
    "we thus suggest that the new wn / c star is surrounded by its own emission - line nebula .",
    "as noted above , theory predicts that transition stars will be very short - lived if their metallicity is unusually high .",
    "should we be surprised to find such a star in m31 , whose central regions metallicity is higher than solar ?",
    "m31 84 - 1 is at a deprojected m31 galactocentric distance of 52.1 arcmin ( calculated using the same method as @xcite ) , which corresponds to 11.8 kpc , assuming that the distance to m31 is 780 kpc ; @xcite .",
    "it is inside the population i ring located between 9 and 15 kpc from the center of m31 , which contains the most active star formation regions in m31 , and the vast majority of its wr stars ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the average radial velocity derived from the narrow emission lines , @xmath31 , is consistent with the rotational velocity of m31 @xcite at the galactic position of m31 84 - 1 .",
    "we can estimate the metallicity in the environs of m31 84 - 1 by using the radial oxygen and nitrogen abundance profiles of m31 @xcite .",
    "the average metallicity values at an m31 galactocentric distance of 11.8 kpc are : @xmath32 is @xmath33 0.2 dex higher , and @xmath34 is @xmath33 0.3 dex lower , respectively , than the solar values of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated that there is significant intrinsic scatter around the observed m31 abundance gradient , with as much as @xmath3 times the systematic uncertainty in the strong - line diagnostics that they use .",
    "we conclude that the @xcite determinations of metallicity at the galactocentric distance of m31 84 - 1 are consistent with solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite presented evidence that they have found at least 95% of the unreddened wr stars in m31 .",
    "our survey is complementary to theirs because , as noted above , we focus on candidates with strong h@xmath4 emission in images of the publicly - available lggs survey @xcite which are quite red ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus we can not detect new , unreddened wr stars in m31 , but we are sensitive to reddened wr stars if immersed in h@xmath4 nebulosity .",
    "we have detected only one new wr star out 441 red candidates with strong h@xmath4 emission ( @xmath37 ) , and the total number of such objects in the lggs images of m31 is at most a few thousand .",
    "this might suggest that at most @xmath38 new , reddened wr stars remain to be found in m31 .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fc ] demonstrates how crowding makes it very difficult , with ground based imagery , to locate stars even with strong h@xmath4 .",
    "if m31 84 - 1 s h@xmath4 emission were just 2% weaker we would have missed detecting it as a candidate .",
    "most wr stars h@xmath4 emission is weaker than that of our new wr star . furthermore , wr stars on the far side of the m31 disc may be so reddened as to be undetectable in lggs imagery .",
    "we thus can not reliably predict the number of highly reddened wr stars in m31 , but the number may be significant .",
    "we presented the observed and dereddened spectra of , and discussed the first likely transition wn / c transition wr star detected in m31 .",
