    "the discovery of an extrasolar planetary companion orbiting a mere @xmath9 from its host star 51 peg @xcite originally came as a surprise , given the seeming impossibility of forming a giant planet so near to its parent star .",
    "however , the theorists quickly recovered , and , drawing on older works which studied interactions between protoplanets and their natal disks @xcite , invoked planetary migration as the mechanism for delivering the companion to 51 peg from its birthplace to its current observed position ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since this time , considerable progress in the theory of planetary migration , combined with the detection of a large number of additional giant planets on short - period orbits , has left little doubt that this process is important in shaping the architecture of planetary systems . however , many questions remain .",
    "for example , the mechanisms by which planetary migration is stopped are uncertain @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms have the additional burden that they should explain both the observed ` pile - up ' of planetary companions at periods of @xmath10 ( i.e.  @xcite ) , and the newest discovery of a planet at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is clear from examples of extrasolar giant planets orbiting close to their supposed birthplaces , as well as our own solar system , that orbital migration is not always so efficient .",
    "a satisfactory explanation for the causes of these variations in the efficiency of migration is lacking .",
    "it seems plausible that many , if not the majority , of disk stars were initially formed in stellar systems ",
    "loose associations or open clusters that have since dissolved .",
    "evidence for this comes in part from studies of the nearby moving groups @xcite .",
    "planets orbiting stars in stellar systems are subject to numerous effects resulting from the dense stellar environment . planets orbiting at larger distances from their parent stars are generally more sensitive to these effects .",
    "therefore , the structure of planetary systems will be the result of a complex interplay between the local properties of the system that drive planetary formation and migration , and the non - local effects that arise from the star s environment .",
    "thus , if it is indeed the case that most stars formed in stellar clusters , planetary systems can not be understood as isolated systems : a complete picture of planetary formation and evolution must consider both local and non - local effects .",
    "several authors have considered the effects of dense stellar environments on the formation and survival of planetary systems @xcite . from these studies",
    "it is clear that , if distant planets can form in stellar clusters , they are likely to be stripped from their parent stars , resulting in a free - floating population of planets that will slowly evaporate from the system .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that freely - floating brown dwarfs ( bd ) in globular clusters will occasionally be tidally captured , resulting in a detectable population of extremely close - in bd companions to main - sequence stars if the frequency of freely - floating bds is large .",
    "similar considerations can also be applied to planets in stellar systems .",
    "here i consider the formation and stability of extremely close - in giant planetary companions to stars via tidal capture of free - floating planets . in ",
    "[ sec : dynamical ] , i summarize the dynamical processes of ionization , evaporation , capture , and tidal decay , and their relevant timescales . in ",
    "[ sec : frequency ] , i give a crude estimate for the frequency of extremely close - in giant planets as a function of the parameters of the stellar system . in ",
    "[ sec : bds ] , i consider tidally - captured bd and planetary companions to stars in globular clusters , and interpret the null result of the 47 tuc transit search @xcite . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : implications ] , i discuss possible implications and prospects for the detection of such a population of planetary companions .",
    "it is not clear if planets can form around stars in stellar systems at all . in particular , in rich clusters with @xmath12 members",
    ", high - mass stars can generate an ultraviolet radiation field that is sufficiently intense to photoevaporate protoplanetary discs in a few hundred thousand years @xcite",
    ". however , planet formation might still be possible if there exists a substantial delay between high and low - mass star formation .",
    "this fact , combined with our incomplete understanding of the efficiency of planetary migration , make it difficult to predict a priori the frequency and distribution of planets orbiting stars in stellar systems . for the purposes of discussion",
    ", i will sweep all of these uncertainties under the rug , and simply consider the evolution and consequences of a substantial population of long - period planets around stars in stellar systems .",
    "binaries in stellar systems evolve under random encounters with other stars in the system",
    ". this evolution proceeds according to heggie s law @xcite , such that soft binaries tend to get disrupted by encounters .",
    "a binary is soft when its binding energy is equal to the mean kinetic energy of the stars in the system .",
    "thus there is a critical separation above which binaries will tend to be disrupted , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of the secondary , @xmath15 is the mass of the primary , @xmath16 is the average mass and @xmath17 is the velocity dispersion of the cluster stars , respectively .",
    "planetary companions to solar - type stars ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in typical open clusters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are will tend to get disrupted if @xmath22 , or @xmath23 .",
    "the timescale for disruption of a planet is approximately the time it takes for the random encounters to change the planet s energy by an amount equal to its binding energy @xcite , @xmath24 here @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the stellar number density , and @xmath27 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the number density and velocity dispersion within a stellar system can vary by several orders of magnitude . for simplicity",
    ", here i will adopt these properties averaged over the region interior to @xmath28 , the half - mass radius of the cluster .",
    "the mean stellar density in this area is simply @xmath29 for a wide range of equilibrium stellar systems , the half - mass radius can be related to the total mass and velocity dispersion of the system by @xcite , @xmath30 i will adopt this relation throughout unless stated otherwise . for an average stellar density @xmath31 and velocity dispersion @xmath32 , the above relation yields @xmath33 . for the stellar parameters given above , @xmath34 .",
    "thus most planets with @xmath35 in an open cluster will be disrupted over the cluster s lifetime ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "since planets are typically liberated due to the accumulated effects of distant encounters , free - floating planets will initially have velocities similar to the stars , and will not escape the system immediately @xcite .",
    "however , equipartition of energy will slowly drive the velocity dispersion of free - floating planets to the point where many of the planets have sufficient velocities to evaporate from the system entirely . assuming that the stellar component of the system dominates the mass , the characteristic timescale for this process is the relaxation timescale @xcite , @xmath37 for the parameters adopted above , this yields @xmath38 .",
    "freely - floating planets will occasionally pass sufficiently close to another star to raise a significant tide .",
    "if the energy required to raise this tide is larger than the relative energy of the planet and star at infinity , then the encounter will lead to a bound system @xcite .",
    "this leads to the requirement that the planet must pass within a minimum distance @xmath39 to be captured @xcite , @xmath40^{1/6}. \\label{eqn : acap}\\ ] ] for @xmath41 , @xmath19 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "thus the planet must pass within two stellar radii to be captured .",
    "the timescale for tidal capture is , @xmath44 where i have assumed that @xmath45 , which is valid for the cases considered here .",
    "i find @xmath46 .",
    "assuming every star forms @xmath47 planets that are liberated from their parent stars essentially immediately , the fraction of stars with tidally captured planet can be crudely estimated as @xmath48 .",
    "planets passing within @xmath49 of a star will physically collide with it , resulting in a merger .",
    "this therefore sets an absolute lower limit on the period of a tidally captured planet . for gaseous objects supported only by degeneracy pressure ( including giant planets and brown dwarfs ) , @xmath50 , roughly independent of mass . for @xmath42 , @xmath51 , or a period of @xmath52 .",
    "this also sets a lower limit on the mass of a planet that can be captured , as very low - mas planets must pass within the collision separation in order to raise a sufficient tide to be captured .",
    "this limit is found by equating @xmath53 with @xmath39 : @xmath54 where i have assumed @xmath55 . for the fiducial parameters , this is @xmath56 .",
    "low - mass planets may also be tidally captured sufficiently close to their parent stars that their radii exceed the roche limit .",
    "the limiting separation for roche lobe overflow is , @xmath57 where , for the last relation , i have assumed @xmath58 .",
    "the roche limit separation exceeds @xmath53 for @xmath59 .",
    "planets that are captured within their roche limit will lose mass to their parent star .",
    "this mass loss is accompanied by a transfer of angular momentum , resulting in an outward migration of the planet .",
    "thus a planet initially captured inside its roche limit can still result in a stable system .",
    "the lower the mass of the planet , the farther it must migrate to halt mass transfer .",
    "very low mass captured planets may not survive at all .",
    "planets captured into very close orbits will quickly circularize , on a timescale of @xmath60 years @xcite , and thereafter be subject to tidal decay .",
    "the timescale for tidal decay is ( e.g.@xcite ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of the convective zone ; for solar - type stars , @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the convective eddy turnover timescale , which i will approximate as @xmath65^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath66 is the luminosity of the star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for solar - type stars , @xmath67 .",
    "thus for tidally - captured planets , @xmath68 , and the largest eddies can no longer contribute to the total viscosity , resulting is a suppression of the viscous dissipation . therefore @xmath69 is less than unity",
    "however , the correct form for @xmath69 remains controversial ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "following @xcite , i will consider both linear suppression of the eddy viscosity @xcite , @xmath70 as well as quadratic suppression @xcite , @xmath71 although quadratic suppression is theoretically better motivated , linear suppression appears to be in better agreement with the observed timescale of tidal circularization in close binaries @xcite",
    ".    for tidally - captured planets with @xmath72 , the decay timescale for linear suppression is @xmath73 , whereas for quadratic suppression , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the choice of prescription has an enormous effect on the number of surviving tidally - captured planets : one expects a negligible number of surviving planets for linear suppression , whereas planets are stable over much longer than @xmath75 for quadratic suppression .",
    "the angular momentum lost from the tidal decay of the planet s orbit will be transfered to the star , spinning it up . assuming the star is initially slowly rotating , spin - up of",
    "the star will occur on a timescale @xcite , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the moments of inertia of the star and orbit , and @xmath79 . for @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "thus companions with @xmath83 will decay before they spin - up the star sufficiently to synchronize the star s spin period with the orbital period .",
    "conversely , companions with @xmath84 will synchronize before they decay completely .",
    "this equilibrium is stable only if the orbital angular momentum of the planet is more than three times the spin angular momentum of the star @xcite .",
    "this leads to a minimum mass ratio for stability , @xmath85 thus companions with @xmath86 can not reach a stable equilibrium , and will always decay .",
    "more massive companions may reach a stable equilibrium .",
    "the question of orbital stability via synchronization is further complicated by the fact that the star will likely be spun - up as a result of the capture process itself , and thus may be fairly rapidly rotating .",
    "this will not only affect the viscous dissipation mechanisms , but will also generally shorten the timescale for synchronization .",
    "given the uncertainties involved in determining the effects of these various process , and since i am primarily interested in planetary - mass companions , for which synchronization is likely less important , i will furthermore ignore synchronization entirely , and assume that all orbits decay on the timescale given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tdec ] ) .",
    "however , i note that this issue has direct bearing on the discussion of the stability of tidally - captured bd companions to stars in 47 tuc in  [ sec : bds ] .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] summarizes the regions of parameter space in the companion mass - period plane where ionization , tidal capture , and tidal decay are important , as discussed in this section . for this figure ,",
    "i have assumed as before @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "in addition , i have assumed a fixed companion radius of @xmath92 , and a system lifetime of @xmath93 .",
    "assuming quadratic suppression prescription of tidal decay , there is a small sliver of parameter space in the period - mass plane of where planets can be tidally captured and are stable to tidal decay over typical open cluster lifetimes . for linear suppression ,",
    "there is no region of parameter space where tidally - captured planets are expected to be stable on such timescales . also shown",
    "are known extrasolar planets .",
    "clearly tidally - captured planets occupy a region of parameter space that is relatively disjoint from known companions , and would likely to easily identified as the result of capture ( rather than migration ) .",
    "the frequency of tidally - captured planets in a stellar system of a given age depends on the competing effects of ionization , evaporation , capture , and orbital decay .",
    "the exact number will depend on the balance between the timescales of these various dynamical effects .",
    "this will in turn depend on the dynamical properties of the cluster at all times in its evolution , and thus the processes of relaxation , mass segregation , mass loss , etc .",
    ", should all be considered .",
    "ideally , the most robust way to accomplish this is through detailed n - body simulations .",
    "however , such a study is outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "furthermore , such a detailed study is perhaps not warranted , as the number of tidally captured planets will also depend critically on the initial frequency and distribution of planets formed around stars in the cluster .",
    "given that a general theory of planet formation is lacking , this can only be a wild guess at best .",
    "i therefore simply provide only a crude estimate for the frequency of tidally - captured planets .",
    "this estimate should be good to an order - of - magnitude , and should serve to elucidate the dependence of the frequency on the gross parameters of the stellar system and the input assumptions .",
    "i consider only average properties of the stars and planets in the stellar system .",
    "the dynamical properties of the stellar system are specified by the average number density @xmath26 and velocity dispersion @xmath17 inside the half - mass radius , and the average mass of the stars , @xmath16 .",
    "the total number is then set by equations ( [ eqn : numean ] ) and ( [ eqn : rhm ] ) . unless otherwise stated , i assume @xmath94 , which is roughly appropriate for mass functions observed in the field , young clusters , open clusters , and globular clusters ( see @xcite ) . here and throughout , i adopt radii and bolometric luminosities from @xcite and convective zone masses from @xcite .    for my fiducial calculations ,",
    "i assume that every star in the system originally has four companions with mass @xmath95 , with a distribution that is uniform in @xmath96 between @xmath97 .",
    "this choice is primarily motivated by the distribution of massive planets in our own solar system , but is not inconsistent with the distribution of extrasolar planets detected via radial velocity surveys .",
    "these surveys are only just becoming sensitive to planets around solar - type stars at @xmath98 ; however extrapolations based on current samples indicate that the fraction of stars with jupiter - mass planets at periods longer than this may be quite large ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the same distribution of @xmath99 but other choices for the frequency of massive planets , one can simply scale all results by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the average number of planets per star .",
    "free - floating planets in stellar stellar are depleted via evaporation and replenished by disruption of bound planets .",
    "the rate of change in the number @xmath102 of free - floating planets per star is thus @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the rate at which planets are ionized , @xmath105 .",
    "\\label{eqn : dnioindt}\\ ] ] here @xmath106 is the initial distribution of planetary companions , which is constant between @xmath107 and zero otherwise , and @xmath108 is the probability that planet with separation @xmath99 will be disrupted .",
    "the rate at which planets are evaporated is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the evaporation probability appropriate for test particles @xcite .",
    "the number of free - floating planets as a function of time can be found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dnffdt ] ) from @xmath111 .",
    "tidally - captured planets are depleted via orbital decay and replenished via new captures of free - floating planets .",
    "the rate of change in the number @xmath112 of tidally - captured planets per star is thus @xmath113 i determine the mean capture cross section by averaging the width of the region between @xmath39 and @xmath53 , which depends on the relative velocity between the planet and star , over a maxwellian ( relative ) velocity distribution with dispersion @xmath17 .",
    "i then evaluate @xmath114 for this cross section , and @xmath115 for the average semi - major axis of the captured planets .",
    "the number of surviving free - floating planets is then found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dnsurdt ] ) .",
    "note that i have ignored the effects of mass segregation .",
    "mass segregation will decrease the rate at which planets are captured , as it will partially decouple the dynamical interactions between the stellar and free - floating planetary populations .",
    "this will generally be a relatively small correction , as most planets are tidally captured during the first few relaxation times of the cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the resulting evolution of the planetary population for three types of stellar systems , characterized by the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath17 .",
    "these are @xmath116 and @xmath117 , appropriate to a globular cluster , @xmath91 , @xmath90 , appropriate to a rich open cluster , and @xmath118 , @xmath119 , appropriate to a loose association .",
    "these systems have a total number of stars and half - mass radii equal to @xmath120 , @xmath121 ( globular cluster ) , @xmath122 , @xmath123 ( rich open cluster ) and @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( association ) .",
    "these values are not meant to be definitive , but merely span the interesting range of possible systems .",
    "note that @xmath28 does not enter into the calculations directly , and @xmath126 enters only logarithmically via the coulomb logarithm .",
    "due to their high stellar density and velocity dispersions , globular clusters generally have relatively small disruption timescales and long relaxation timescales .",
    "therefore , planets are liberated from their parent stars very quickly , and evaporation is slow , making the dynamics particularly simple : the number density of free - floating planets is roughly constant , and @xmath127 is approximately constant when tidal decay is negligible . at the typical globular cluster lifetime of @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the evolution of rich open clusters is more complicated due to their short relaxation times . from inspection of figure [ fig : two ] , it is clear that the majority of planets are tidally captured within a time @xmath130 , after which the number of surviving planets is approximately constant at @xmath131 .",
    "the lifetime of open clusters is uncertain , but rich clusters have been observed with ages of a @xmath132 or more @xcite .",
    "less massive clusters are probably dissolved on shorter timescales .",
    "loose associations have even shorter relaxation times , but are otherwise similar to open clusters .",
    "however one important difference is that , because of their smaller velocity dispersions , planets are captured at larger separations . due to the extremely strong dependence of the tidal decay rate on the semi - major axis ,",
    "this has a profound effect on the survival of tidally - captured planets for the linear prescription for the suppression of eddy viscosity : even under such a prescription , one expects a significant number of surviving tidally - captured planets at a @xmath132 or less .",
    "loose associations are likely to disperse fairly rapidly , on timescales of a few hundred million years or less . at @xmath133 years , @xmath134",
    "because of their high encounter rates and large numbers of stars , globular clusters are expected to contain a large number of systems formed via tidal capture .",
    "using the results from the previous section , a system with @xmath135 and @xmath136 should have @xmath137 systems of tidally - captured planets .",
    "this process is not limited to planets stripped from their parent stars , of course : any planets and brown dwarfs formed in isolation will also be tidally captured by stars in globular clusters .",
    "the initial mass function of single objects is observed to be approximately flat down to well below the hydrogen burning limit in many young clusters ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "such a mass function implies a similar number density of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "if this mass function is universal then globular clusters should also contain a large number of stars with tidally - captured bd companions @xcite .    because of their extremely close orbits , tidally - captured planetary and bd companions have a very high probability ( @xmath138 ) of transiting their parent star , making photometric monitoring an ideal way of detecting such companions .",
    "@xcite monitored the globular cluster 47 tuc continuously for @xmath139 using the hubble space telescope , but found no transits .",
    "this null result can be used to place constraints on the initial frequency of planetary companions as well as freely - floating planets and bds formed in isolation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the expected number of tidally - captured companions per star in 47 tuc as a function of the mass of the companion , for both linear and quadratic prescriptions for viscosity suppression .",
    "i have adopted parameters appropriate to 47 tuc , namely @xmath116 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and an age of @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "note that here i do not assume eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rhm ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] assumes an initial frequency of one object ( planet or brown dwarf ) per star . due to the extremely high disruption rate , these results are essentially independent of whether the objects are initially free - floating , or bound on orbits with @xmath144 . for the quadratic prescription for viscosity suppression , the expected frequency of tidally - captured bd ( @xmath145 ) companions is @xmath146 companions per star , whereas the frequency of tidally - captured jupiter - mass planets is @xmath147 .",
    "@xcite claim that , if @xmath148 of the 34,091 main - sequence stars they monitored had @xmath149 companions at periods of @xmath150 , then they should have seen 17 planets .",
    "this implies a 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit of @xmath151 to the fraction of main - sequence stars with such companions .",
    "this null result can also combined with the prediction for the number of tidally - captured companions @xmath112 to determine an upper limit to the initial frequency @xmath101 of objects per star of @xmath152 here @xmath153 is the transit probability .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the resulting 95% c.l .  upper limit to the initial frequency of objects as a function of the mass of the object .",
    "the shaded region comes from varying @xmath69 in the range @xmath154 .",
    "the null result implies that , on average , each star in 47 tuc originally formed @xmath155 planet with mass @xmath156 , or @xmath157 planets with @xmath158 .",
    "less than 50% of stars in 47 tuc could have formed solar - system analogs .",
    "while this limit is considerably weaker than the original limit placed by @xcite of @xmath6 , it is important to emphasize that this original limit applies only to planets in close ( @xmath159 ) orbits . since planets in such small orbits were not formed in situ , and must be the result of migration , drawing conclusions about the formation of planets at larger separations based on the lack of planets at small separations is subject to uncertainties in the timescale for orbital migration .",
    "if the migration timescale were greater than or of order the disruption timescale , the planets would have been stripped from their parent stars before they had a chance to migrate sufficiently close to be detectable via transits .",
    "in contrast , the limit on the frequency of planets implied by the lack of tidally - captured planets , although weaker , is essentially independent of where they were initially formed . in fact , one can conclude the initial number of free - floating planets ( planets formed in isolation via gas fragmentation and collapse ) is also less than or equal to the number of stars .    under a similar set of assumptions",
    "as adopted here , but using a more sophisticated simulation and neglecting orbital decay , @xcite found an upper limit to the bd frequency in 47 tuc of @xmath160 .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the upper limit derived using the formalism in  [ sec : frequency ] , but neglecting orbital decay .",
    "i find @xmath161 , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , in the absence of orbital decay , the predicted frequency of tidally - captured bd companions should be reasonably robust .    for quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity ,",
    "the timescale for orbital decay of tidally - captured bd ( @xmath162 ) companions is @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , approximately @xmath164 of the captured bd will still be present today .",
    "thus tidal decay is significant at the current age of 47 tuc for tidally - captured bd companions .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the upper limit including orbital decay . the limit is revised upward by @xmath165 relative to the estimate of @xcite .",
    "the lack of transiting bd companions in 47 tuc implies that the initial frequency of bds relative to stars is @xmath166 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath167 on the relative frequency of bds in 47 tuc is inconsistent with the observed mass functions of most young clusters and the field , for which bds and stars exist in equal numbers @xcite , although it is consistent with the frequency of bds in the taurus star - forming region @xcite . at face value , this is an indication that the initial mass function compact objects is not universal @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this conclusion relies heavily on the assumed value for the tidal decay timescale .",
    "different assumptions for the mechanisms for tidal dissipation will give rise to radically different conclusions .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : three ] i show the predicted frequency of tidally - captured companions under the assumption of linear suppression of eddy viscosity .",
    "the frequencies are always @xmath168 , i.e. @xmath169 in the entire cluster .",
    "this low number results from the fact that the tidal decay timescale under linear suppression is smaller by a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "thus @xmath171 , and the frequency of tidally - captured objects is only @xmath172 .",
    "obviously the resulting upper limits are not very interesting .",
    "even if one accepts that the quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity is correct , there are still some ambiguities .",
    "for example , there exist discrepancies in the quoted form for @xmath173 : @xcite and @xcite use the form adopted here , namely @xmath174 , but @xcite adopt @xmath175 , i.e.  larger by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this factor translates directly to the implied upper limit on the relative frequency , weakening the constraint considerably ( see fig .  [ fig : three ] ) .",
    "note that this would also weaken the constraint on planets in 47 tuc , but by a smaller factor than the constraint on bds .",
    "thus , given the current uncertainties in the physics of tidal dissipation , i conclude that no robust inferences can made about the frequency of brown dwarf companions in 47 tuc , and any conclusions regarding the universality of the initial mass function are probably premature .",
    "it is clear that , under certain sets of assumptions , extremely close - in tidally - captured massive planets should exist around stars formed in dense stellar systems .",
    "what are the prospects for the detection of such companions , and what would be the implications of any such detections ?    given their extremely close orbits , the most promising method for detecting companions is transits . for a planet captured at an orbit of @xmath176 ,",
    "the transit probability is @xmath177 .",
    "the duration of the transit is @xmath178 , \\label{eqn : transdur}\\ ] ] where @xmath179 is the inclination .",
    "thus for a central transit , the duty cycle ( fraction of time in transit ) is quite large : @xmath180 . for a solar - type primary , the transits will last @xmath181 and recur every @xmath182",
    ". the transit depth will be @xmath183 . given the extremely close proximity of the planet to the star , one might worry that the planet will induce additional photometric variations on the star .",
    "the reflected light from the companion will induce an fractional flux variation of order @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the geometric albedo , and i have adopted @xmath186 as appropriate for lambert sphere scattering . although five times lower than the signal from the transit , a signal of this magnitude may be large enough to be detected .",
    "in fact , depending on the selection criterion used to choose targets for the transit search in 47 tuc , this may be cause for concern in interpreting this result",
    ". the planet will also induce photometric variations of the star from tidal and doppler effects , but these will likely be small for planetary companions @xcite .",
    "they may , however , be significant for more massive companions .",
    "thus , barring an unforeseen effects that induce additional photometric variability , it should be possible to cleanly detect tidally - captured planets via transits .    because of their short periods and relatively large duty cycles , the observational requirements of a transit search for tidally - captured planets are generally much less severe than transit searches for more distant planets .",
    "in particular , complete coverage of several phases can be achieved in less than a few days .",
    "this is especially important for ground - based transit searches , as the coherence time of weather patterns is typically several days .",
    "this proves to be devastating when searching for planets with periods of order the coherence time , but nearly optimal for very short periods .",
    "furthermore , aliasing is minimized because the period of the planet is typically less than the duration of a typical clear observing night .",
    "tidally - captured planets will also induce radial velocity variations in the host star , of amplitude @xmath187 .",
    "for reasonably bright sources , this is well within reach of current instrumentation .",
    "however , the presence of such a close planet may induce additional radial velocity variability , making detection of the planetary signal difficult .",
    "furthermore , the extremely low expected frequency of tidally - captured planets makes this an extremely inefficient method of detection , unless multi - object spectrographs capable of precision radial velocity measurements become available , so that many stars can be monitored simultaneously .",
    "the systems that offer the best chance of observing tidally - captured planets are globular clusters , because they have the highest frequencies of captured planets ( @xmath188 ) , and the largest total number of systems .",
    "furthermore , due to the large velocity dispersions , planets are captured into very close orbits .",
    "this increases the a priori probability that the planet will transit its parent stars to nearly unity . in ",
    "[ sec : bds ] , i considered in detail frequency and detectability of tidally - captured planets in 47 tuc . although no transiting planets were found in this cluster , it may still be worthwhile to search in other clusters .",
    "an observing campaign with the hubble space telescope need not be as ambitious as that toward 47 tuc .",
    "the expected number of transiting , tidally - captured planets in a rich open cluster is only of order unity .",
    "therefore , the prospects of detecting such planets in transit searches toward open clusters @xcite are poor , unless many massive planets are formed per star .",
    "loose clusters are subject to fairly rapid disruption , after which their stars disperse into the general disk population .",
    "it is possible that a large fraction of stars in the disk were initially born in such environments . assuming a typical lifetime of a loose cluster of @xmath189 ,",
    "then @xmath190 of stars in the field should have a tidally - captured planet , if all stars in the field were born in associations , and planet formation were ubiquitous . accounting for a binary fraction of 50% , and assuming a transit probability of @xmath191 for planets captured in loose clusters",
    ", i estimate that @xmath192 stars need to be monitored to have a chance of detecting even one transiting tidally - captured planet .",
    "ogle monitored 5 million stars toward the galactic bulge over 45 nights to search for transiting planets to disk stars @xcite .",
    "they only analyze a subset of @xmath193 of these stars with photometry better than @xmath194 .",
    "similarly , the explore project has monitored @xmath195 stars in the galactic plane for 11 nights @xcite .",
    "they achieved better than @xmath196 photometry for a subset of 37,000 stars , which they visually inspected for transits . in both cases ,",
    "an insufficient number of stars were searched to place interesting constraints on the fraction of tidally - captured planets . however , because of the large number of expected transits , it should be possible to detect transiting planets even when the scatter is larger than the expected signal .",
    "therefore , the optimal ( but time - consuming ) approach would be to search all light curves for transiting planets .",
    "for such a photon - limited survey , the detection probability scales as @xmath197 @xcite , highly favoring extremely close - in tidally - captured planets .",
    "it is important to reiterate that all of these frequency estimates rely on the assumption that the tidal decay timescale is longer than @xmath198 , and thus that the quadratic prescription for the suppression of eddy viscosity is approximately correct .",
    "the only exception is planets captured in loose associations .",
    "such planets are captured sufficiently far from their parent stars that they are stable over @xmath199 timescales for both linear and quadratic prescriptions .",
    "however , for ages much larger than @xmath200 , the orbits will rapidly decay under the linear prescription ( see fig.[fig : two ] ) .",
    "the detection of a planet on an extremely close orbit would therefore have important implications for the tidal dissipation theory .",
    "how can tidally - captured planets be distinguished from planets that migrated to such close orbits ?",
    "the period distribution of radial - velocity planets shows a pile - up at @xmath201 , with a significant lack of planets with smaller periods .",
    "tidally - captured planets would be easily identified in such a distribution .",
    "@xcite suggest that this distribution arises from the fact that the centers of protoplanetary disks are evacuated interior to separations corresponding to periods of @xmath202 , and that planetary migration thus halts when the planet s outer lindlbad resonance reaches the inner disk edge .",
    "although this seems to provide a compelling explanation for the observed period distribution of radial velocity planets , the recent detection of a transiting planet at @xmath203 @xcite generally suggests that this picture can not be universal @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest another mechanism for halting migration : planets migrate until they reach their roche limit , at which point they lose enough mass to the parent star to balance inward migration .",
    "if disk dispersal occurs in a sufficiently short time , the planets will be left intact in short - period orbits .",
    "such planets would generally have similar periods as tidally - captured planets .",
    "therefore , additional diagnostics are needed .",
    "one possible method of distinguishing tidally - captured planets from migrating planets is a radius measurement .",
    "both known transiting planets have radii significantly larger than that of jupiter .",
    "it has been suggested that these large radii are due to the fact that these planets migrated on a sufficiently short timescale that their gravitational contraction was retarded , leaving them in a permanently inflated state @xcite .",
    "if this process is universal , then we can expect migrated planets to have significantly larger radii than tidally - captured planets , which could not have migrated far from their birthplaces .",
    "this assumes that there are no processes that can inflate planets once they have been tidally captured . in principle",
    ", variable tidal forces from the star on a planet in an eccentric orbit can deposit enough energy to inflate the planet @xcite , but to have a significant effect , there must be some external force continuously pumping the eccentricity , since the circularization timescale for extremely close - in planets is very short .",
    "planets which form around stars born in dense stellar environments are subject to dynamical perturbations from other stars in the system .",
    "these perturbations will generally serve to strip outer planets from their parent stars , leading to a significant population of freely - floating planets in the system .",
    "further interactions with stars in the system drive this planetary population toward equipartition , thus raising the velocity dispersion of the planets , ultimately resulting in escape from the system .",
    "however , some planets will survive long enough to be pass sufficiently close to another star to be tidally captured .",
    "the stability of tidally - captured planets against orbital decay depends critically on the physics of viscous dissipation of the tide in the convective envelope of the star .",
    "this processes is extremely uncertain , and different prescriptions lead to decay timescales that differ by four orders of magnitude",
    ". for quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity , planets on tidally - captured orbits will generally be stable for @xmath204 , whereas for linear suppression , planets will decay very quickly .",
    "the frequency of tidally - captured planets depends on the competing effects of dynamical stripping , evaporation , capture , and orbital decay .",
    "the timescales for these effects depend in turn on the properties of the stellar systems , particularly the velocity dispersion @xmath17 and the number density @xmath26 . under the assumption that all stars form four jupiter - mass planets with a uniform logarithmic distribution in semi - major axis between @xmath97 , and assuming quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity ,",
    "i have estimated the frequency of tidally - captured planets in a stellar system as a function of the age , velocity dispersion , and number density of the system .    for loose associations with @xmath205 and @xmath206 ,",
    "the frequency of tidally - captured planets after a typical cluster lifetime of @xmath133 years is @xmath190 . if most stars formed in such systems , this is roughly the expected frequency of extremely close - in planetary companions to stars in the field .",
    "these planets may be found by deep , wide - angle searches for transiting planets around disk stars @xcite .",
    "detection of such a population would imply both that most stars were formed in dense stellar environments , and that the timescale for orbital decay is @xmath204 .    for rich open clusters ( @xmath32 and @xmath207 ) ,",
    "the frequency of tidally - captured planets is @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , the prospects for detecting such a population of planets in a given cluster are poor , as @xmath7 transiting planet per cluster is expected .    due to the long relaxation times and high encounter rates ,",
    "the frequency of tidally - captured planets in a typical globular cluster ( @xmath136 and @xmath208 ) is @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , one expects several hundred transiting planets in each globular cluster .",
    "the relatively high frequency of tidal capture in globular clusters makes them excellent targets to search for such systems .",
    "the null result of the search for transiting planets in 47 tuc can be used to place interesting constraints on the initial frequency of planets and brown - dwarfs ( either initially free - floating or bound ) relative to stars .",
    "i find that @xmath7 planet with mass @xmath209 originally formed per star in 47 tuc .",
    "less than 50% of stars formed solar - system analogs .",
    "the initial frequency of brown dwarfs relative to stars is @xmath210 .",
    "all of these conclusions are under the assumption of quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity .",
    "if viscosity suppression is much less efficient , no interesting constraints can be placed .",
    "tidally - captured planets will have orbital periods of @xmath211 , and can be distinguished from migrating planets from their distribution of orbital periods provided the mechanism that is observed to halt planetary migration at @xmath201 is robust .",
    "however , if the recent discovery of a planet at @xmath212 is indeed indicating that there exist multiple mechanisms for halting migration , then one can not rule out the hypothesis that an observed extremely close - in planet was the result of orbital migration . however , the radii of tidally - captured planets are expected to be similar to their radius at their sites of formation , and thus considerably smaller than planets that migrated quickly to close orbits .",
    "thus a radius measurement might provide a diagnostic for tidally - captured planets .",
    "if the majority of stars is formed in dense stellar environments , then most planetary systems will be subject to a variety of dynamical effects that can alter planetary formation , migration , and survival . therefore",
    ", planetary systems can not be understood as isolated systems , and the interpretation of the observed properties of extrasolar planets will require the consideration of these effects .",
    "this study highlights one example of how such considerations can lead to new observable diagnostics of planetary formation .",
