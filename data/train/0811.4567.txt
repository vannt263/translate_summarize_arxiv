    "condensates of microcavity polaritons  @xcite are a solid state realization of the two dimensional bose gas .",
    "their succesful creation relies on the peculiar nature of the microcavity polariton quasiparticle , that combine a very light effective mass ( high quantum degeneracy temperature ) with interparticle interactions that provide efficient relaxation .",
    "the formation of spontaneous coherence in these systems is now routinely achieved in several laboratories  @xcite .    one crucial difference between polariton condensates and other realizations of the two dimensional bose gas such as liquid @xmath0he films  @xcite and tightly confined ultracold atomic gases  @xcite comes from the finite life time of the microcavity polaritons of the order of a few ps .",
    "in order to compensate for the polariton losses , new particles can be continuously injected into the microcavity .",
    "the resulting steady state is not a thermal equilibrium one , still it shows features expected for an equilibrium bec .",
    "for example , the tail of the momentum distribution can in many cases be fitted by an exponential maxwell - boltzmann decay .",
    "the lack of full thermalization is already clear from the fact that the extracted temperature is in general not equal to the temperature of the reservoir constituted by the semiconductor lattice  @xcite .",
    "effects that have no counterpart at equilibrium have been observed in polariton condensates .",
    "for example , the condensate state can depend dramatically on the size of the excitation spot  @xcite : in the case of a large pump spot the usual condensation around zero momentum is observed , instead for a small excitation spot the condensation occurs on a ring in momentum space .",
    "this difference has been explained within a mean field theory based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , including driving and dissipation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , another remarkable phenomenon related to the flow in a continuously pumped polariton condensate was observed experimentally  @xcite : vortices are spontaneously created in polariton condensates without setting the system into rotation .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of this effect was given in the framework of the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation . in a significant fraction of random landscape realizations",
    "the polariton condensate contains a vortex .",
    "a related prediction was made by keeling and berloff : they found that a rotating vortex lattice can be spontaneously generated in a large regular trap  @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned phenomena can be understood within a mean field theory , i.e. a theory where the quantum polariton field is replaced by a classical field . in this approximation ,",
    "all information on the fluctuations is however lost .",
    "since we deal with a two - dimensional system , the physics of fluctuations in polariton condensates is in analogy with equilibrium systems expected to be very rich  @xcite and the question arises for example to what extent the physics related to the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless survives the driving and dissipation of polariton condensates .        experimentally , the fluctuations of the polariton condensates have been investigated under the form of the first and second order coherence functions . in the first order",
    "equal time spatial correlation function , long range correlations were observed above the stimulation threshold for condensation  @xcite .",
    "other correlation functions include the temporal first  @xcite and second order coherence  @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical boltzmann equation  @xcite provides a theoretical description of the first order spatial coherence , which is the fourier transform of the momentum distribution . including the details of the relaxation mechanisms , this formalism is expeced to give a reliable estimate for the required polariton density to achieve condensation . above the condensation threshold ,",
    "the random phase approximation contained in the boltzmann equation breaks down and more sophisticated techniques should be used .",
    "schemes that have been implemented in the literature involve the separation of the condensate mode from the excited states  @xcite and a generalization of the boltzmann equation that includes the coherences within a bogoliubov approximation  @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable consequences of the nonequilibrium nature of the polariton condensates is that the collective excitation spectrum is changed at low wave vectors : a diffusive instead of soundlike character is found for the low energy phase modes .",
    "this dispersion of elementary excitations was found in a theoretical description based on a keldysh green function technique worked out by the littlewood group  @xcite .",
    "the same spectrum is straightforwardly recovered by linearizing the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation around a steady state  @xcite , a calculation that is easily extended to spatially nonuniform situations .",
    "it is well known from quantum optics and the theory of weakly interacting bose gases that fluctuations can be included by introducing a stochastic element in the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "for polariton systems in the parametric oscillation regime , such a method was used in ref .",
    "one of the great advantages of these so called _ classical field _",
    "methods is that the nonuniformity of a system does not introduce any appreciable extra cost in their numerical implementation .",
    "a second advantage is that practical numerical calculations do not require a perturbative expansion around a condensed state and can even be applied to study physics related to the condensation phase transition  @xcite .",
    "finally , these methods can describe the evolution of the system in real time so that information on both the steady state and transients can be obtained .",
    "the latter can be of particular use to model experiments that are performed under pulsed excitation  @xcite .",
    "due to the approximations involved in the classical field methods , they can not describe the particles up to arbitrary large momenta , where quantum effects ( most notably spontaneous scattering ) are dominant  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "polariton condensates are very well suited for a classical field description , because , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , the phase space can be naturally divided into two parts : i ) a low energy polaritonic region with a small effective mass that shows quantum coherence above a certain threshold density and ii ) a high energy excitonic ` reservoir ' region with a high effective mass that under typical experimental densities behaves as an incoherent classical gas .",
    "the role of the two subsystems is very different : the polaritonic field is the quantity of experimental interest because it is easily accessible in photoluminescence experiments and can be driven into the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "the role of the reservoir is to replenish the polariton region through relaxation .",
    "we will present in this paper a set of classical field equations for the ( wigner distribution function of the ) polariton dynamics coupled to the exciton reservoir and apply them to calculate the equal time first and second order coherence functions across the condensation threshold . for simplicity",

    ", the magnitude of fluctuations can be parametrized by a single quantity , the temperature . for a weakly interacting system ,",
    "this temperature can be extracted by fitting the tail of the momentum distribution with a maxwellian curve .",
    "experiments have shown that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution is also recovered for the tail of the out of equilibrium polariton distribution  @xcite and has even been experimentally observed in the case of weak coupling lasing  @xcite .",
    "we will show that out of equilibrium , the universal characterization of fluctuations by a temperature parameter breaks down .",

    "( [ eq : motnormfin ] ) ) has no influence and the fit of the coherence by the @xmath116 of the noninteracting bose gas yields the reservoir temperature of 2 mev . for the simulation above the threshold , a higher value of @xmath87 improves the long range coherence .",
    "both spatial coherence functions are relatively well fitted by the one of a noninteracting bose gas .",
    "both temperatures are below the reservoir temperature .",
    "the lowest effective temperature is obtained for the largest feedback parameter @xmath87 .",

    "the full line shows the decay of the correlations in a non - interacting bose gas , at the temperature reported in the panels.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in the simulations of fig .",

    "[ fig : g1_rout ] , we have included this effect . in order to avoid exceedingly large rates in the model ,",

    "e/ t_r}$ ] .",
    "[ fig : g1_rout ] shows that the out - scattering has a big effect on the coherence function .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , because the out - scattering increases the fluctuations ( physically shot noise due to the discrete nature of the polariton field ) .",
    "keeping @xmath120 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1_2x ] , but including some out - scattering , the coherence in panel ( a ) is dramatically decreased . as compared to the simulations of fig .",
    "[ fig : g1_2x ] , the effect of @xmath87 is much more pronounced .",
    "for the smallest value of @xmath87 , the temperature of 5.5 mev for which the spatial coherence is reasonably well fitted , is much larger than the one that is extracted from the tail of the momentum distribution ( less than 1 mev ) : the polariton condensate behaves in this regime very different from the ideal bose gas .    , but including out - scattering .",
    "simulatios with @xmath121 ( a ) and @xmath122 ( b ) are shown.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    another quantity of great physical interest is the second order coherence function @xmath123 , that quantifies the density fluctuations .",
    "experimentally , the equal position second order coherence was investigated , in ref .",
    "@xcite for equal times @xmath124 and in ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of the delay @xmath125 . within the wigner formalism ,",
    "different time correlation functions are not straighforwardly calculable , so we present here only results for the equal time second order coherence .",
    "results of the equal position second order coherence @xmath126 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] , for several parameter values . as expected , @xmath127 approaches the value 2 of the incoherent bose gas in the low density regime . for increasing polariton densities ,",
    "the second order coherence decreases , but its actual value depends again strongly on the chosen parameter values .",
    "a larger value of the feedback parameter @xmath87 , suppresses the density fluctuations .",
    "this is in agreement with the model described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the density fluctuations are proportional to the saturation density ( large saturation density means small feedback from the condensate on the reservoir ) .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] also shows that the out - scattering increases the density fluctuations .",
    "this dependence is expected , because adding the knock out processes leaves the deterministic term in the evolution equation for the classical field unaltered , but increases the fluctuations .",
    "note that the density fluctuations are within our model not always monotonous , but for some parameter values show a minimum value slightly above threshold .",
    "nonmonotonous behavior of @xmath127 was also observed in experiments on polariton condensation in cdte microcavities  @xcite .",
    "also in the theoretical work of ref .",
    "@xcite based on a boltzmann equation for the excited states coupled to a master equation for the condensate mode , an increase of density fluctuations above the threshold was found .",
    "it is however important to mention that in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] the interaction energy is very large when @xmath127 increases again ( 1 mev blue shift due to condensate - condensate interactions alone ) .",
    "when the value of the blue shift is reduced to 0.2 mev , @xmath127 is found to be very close to one .",
    "we want to point out that we have not found any regime with good long range spatial coherence and large density fluctuations .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : g1_rout ] ( a ) shows that at the density @xmath128 the spatial coherence is , although longer than the thermal de broglie wave lenth corresponding to @xmath106 , limited to about 10 @xmath129 . physically it is actually not expected that good spatial coherence and strong density fluctuations can go together , because phase fluctuations are coupled to the density fluctuations through the interaction and kinetic energy .",
    "so far , in the experiments on cdte microcavities where the increase of @xmath127 as a function of pump power was observed , no decrease in spatial coherence was seen .",
    "it is possible that the distance at which the spatial coherence was probed is too short for the decrease in spatial coherence to be detectable , but we can not exclude other explanations in terms of extrinsic experimental effects .",
    "the measured density fluctuations could for example contain a component due to intensity fluctuations in the excitation laser .",
    "we have derived classical field equations for a nonresonantly excited polariton condensate in a semiconductor microcavity within the truncated wigner approximation .",
    "thanks to the polariton losses our model remains physical in the low density regime and allows to describe the polariton condensate at all densities .",
    "our equations were shown to reduce to the boltzmann equation in the low density regime below threshold . above threshold ,",
    "the equations were analyzed numerically with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the first and second order spatial coherence were shown to depend dramatically on the feedback from the condensate on the reservoir ( the gain saturation ) and on the collisions with reservoir excitons that knock polaritons out of the condensate .",
    "within our model , the density fluctuations can show nonmonotonous behavior as a function of the polariton density .",
    "we predict that an increase in density fluctuations is accompanied by a decrease in the spatial coherence .    finally",
    ", the vortex defects in individual monte carlo realizations of the polariton field show that the spatial coherence is limited by the spontaneous appearance of vortex defects in the phase",
    ". a further study of the role of vortices is necessary to understand their effect on the spatial coherence .",
