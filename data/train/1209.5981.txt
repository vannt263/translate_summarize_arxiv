    "the gamow - teller ( gt ) nuclear response is a very fertile source of information about important issues related not only to nuclear physics @xcite , but also to astrophysics @xcite and particle physics @xcite . in the case of unstable nuclei",
    "this information is mainly extracted from @xmath6 decays , where there is a severe restriction due to the @xmath7-energy limitation . in the case of stable or close to stability nuclei",
    ", the gt strength is obtained from charge - exchange reactions at intermediate incident energies and forward angles @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the nuclear states are probed at small momentum transfer and the cross section becomes proportional to the gt matrix element without the energy limitations that characterize @xmath6 decays .    the spin - isospin nuclear properties in @xmath1ge and @xmath1se are among the most extensively studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this is due to their significance as double-@xmath6 decay partners and the implications of this process in the determination of the neutrino nature and its absolute mass @xcite .",
    "the study of these nuclei is indeed a part of a large experimental program being pursued in the last several years and aimed to explore the gt properties at low excitation energies of double-@xmath6 decay partners by high resolution charge - exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by the recent high resolution charge - exchange experiment @xmath1ge(@xmath2he@xmath3as @xcite that has allowed the unveilling of some remarkable features of this nucleus , which previous charge - exchange experiments @xcite at much lower resolution were unable to identify .",
    "in particular the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite reported an unusually strong fragmentation of the gt strength that was interpreted in terms of possible effects of deformation . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also noted a lack of correlation among the gt transition strengths feeding the same levels in @xmath1as from the two different directions , gt@xmath0 measured in the @xmath1ge(@xmath2he@xmath3as reaction and gt@xmath4 measured in the @xmath1se@xmath5he)@xmath1as reaction @xcite . in view of this new experimental information that has become available , it is worth reconsidering the theoretical description of these nuclei and the role that deformation might play to understand the observed features .    in this work",
    "we explore the ability of the deformed proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) approach to describe together all of this rich information available at present that includes i ) the global properties of the gt response , such as the total gt strength as well as the location and strength of the gt resonance , ii ) the gt strength distribution in the low - lying excitation region that contains much more accurate information , and iii ) the two - neutrino double-@xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) decay matrix element and the implications of the single @xmath6 branches in the @xmath8 process .",
    "the qrpa is one of the most reliable and broadly used microscopic approximations for calculating the correlated wave functions involved in @xmath6 and double @xmath6 @xcite decay processes , especially after the inclusion of particle - hole ( @xmath9 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath10 ) residual interactions .",
    "the method was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the @xmath6 strength in spherical nuclei .",
    "subsequent extensions of the qrpa method to deal with deformed nuclei were done later in refs .",
    "deformation effects were also studied in the double-@xmath6 decay process @xcite . in particular , it has been found @xcite that the nuclear matrix elements for the @xmath8 process are suppressed with respect to the spherical case with a reduction factor that scales roughly with the deformation difference between parent and daughter .",
    "this suppression mechanism , which is ignored in spherical treatments may play an important role in approaching the theoretical estimates to the experiment .",
    "as it shall be described later , our theoretical approach @xcite is based on a deformed qrpa formalism on top of a selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field with skyrme forces and pairing correlations in the bcs approximation . in particular",
    ", we shall study the dependence on deformation of the single @xmath6 branches that build up the double-@xmath6 process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a brief summary of the theoretical approach used to describe the gt properties .",
    "section iii contains the results obtained for the gt strength distributions , as well as the results for the @xmath8 decay , stressing the effect of deformation .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we describe here briefly the theoretical formalism used in this work , whose details can be found in ref .",
    "first , we carry out a selfconsistent deformed hf calculation with the effective nucleon - nucleon density - dependent skyrme interaction sly4 @xcite , assuming axial deformation and time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates using twelve major shells . pairing correlations between like nucleons",
    "are included in the bcs approximation taking fixed pairing gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences of neighboring nuclei through a symmetric five - term formula involving experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "the occupation probabilities @xmath11 of the single particle levels are computed at the end of each hf iteration and are then used to calculate the one - body density and mean field of the next iteration , so that one gets new single - particle wave functions , energies and occupation numbers at each iteration .",
    "therefore , the selfconsistent determination of the binding energy and deformation includes pairing correlations from the beginning .",
    "after convergence , the qrpa equations are solved on the deformed ground state basis for @xmath1ge and @xmath1se to get their gt strength distributions and to compute the @xmath8 decay matrix element .    to describe gt excitations in the qrpa",
    "we add to the quasiparticle mean field a separable spin - isospin residual interaction in @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "the advantage of using separable forces is that the qrpa energy eigenvalue problem is reduced to finding the roots of an algebraic equation .",
    "the @xmath9 part is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite .",
    "its coupling constant @xmath12 could in principle be obtained in a consistent way from the same skyrme energy density functional as the hf mean field through the second derivatives of the energy functional with respect to the densities and averaging the contact interaction over the nuclear volume , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite to study exotic nuclei .",
    "the @xmath10 part consists of a proton - neutron pairing force and it is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 is usually fitted to the half - lives phenomenology @xcite . following",
    "the above mentioned procedure and taking into account the experience accumulated in this mass region @xcite , we have chosen in this work the values @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev . in addition , we will also show the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions and @xmath8 nuclear matrix elements to the value of coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the technical details to solve the qrpa equations have been described in refs .",
    "here we only mention that , because of the use of separable residual forces , the solutions of the qrpa equations are found by solving first a dispersion relation , which is an algebraic equation of fourth order in the excitation energy @xmath16 .",
    "then , for each value of the energy , the gt transition amplitudes in the intrinsic frame connecting the ground state @xmath17 to one phonon states in the daughter nucleus @xmath18 , are found to be    @xmath19    where @xmath20 with @xmath21 in terms of the occupation amplitudes for neutrons and protons @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and the matrix elements of the spin operator connecting proton and neutron single - particle states , as they come out from the hf+bcs calculation . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the forward and backward amplitudes of the qrpa phonon operator , respectively .    once the intrinsic amplitudes in eq .",

    "we have used the initial and final states in the laboratory frame expressed in terms of the intrinsic states using the bohr and mottelson factorization @xcite .",
    "finally , a quenching factor @xmath30 is included in the calculations to take into account in an effective way all the correlations @xcite that are not properly considered in the present approach .",
    "the role of the residual interactions and bcs correlations on the gt strengths was already studied in ref .",
    "the role of deformation was also studied there , where it was shown that the gt strength distributions corresponding to deformed nuclei are much more fragmented than the corresponding to spherical ones , because of the broken degeneracy of the spherical shells .",
    "it was also shown that the crossing of deformed energy levels , which depends on the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation as well as on the oblate or prolate character , may lead to sizable differences between the gt strength distributions corresponding to different shapes .",
    "these features have been exploited to use the @xmath6-decay properties as an alternative method to learn about the nuclear deformation in highly unstable isotopes @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that deformation is a key ingredient to reproduce the occupation probabilities of the relevant single particle levels in the valence shells of @xmath1ge and @xmath1se involved in the double - beta decay process that have been measured for neutrons @xcite and protons @xcite .",
    "the nuclear double-@xmath6 decay is a rare second order weak interaction process that takes place when the transition to the intermediate nucleus is energetically forbidden or highly retarded .",
    "two decay modes are expected , the two neutrino mode , involving the emission of two electrons and two neutrinos , and the neutrinoless mode with no neutrino leaving the nucleus .",
    "whereas the first type is perfectly compatible with the standard model , the second one violates lepton number conservation and implies the existence of a massive majorana neutrino . because the nuclear wave functions and the underlying theory for treating the neutrinoless and the two - neutrino modes are similar , the gamow - teller part that drives the @xmath8 decay provides insight for theoretical models that are required to reproduce the available experimental information on the @xmath8 half - lives .",
    "the @xmath8 decay is described in the second order perturbation of the weak interaction as two successive gamow - teller transitions via virtual intermediate @xmath31 states .",
    "the basic expressions for the @xmath8 decay within a deformed qrpa formalism can be found in @xcite .",

    "in particular , the combination of deformation parameters @xmath76ge@xmath77 and @xmath76se@xmath78 ( solid black line ) produce optimal results reproducing the experiment .",
    "when the deformations are very different , the matrix element becomes very small as compared to the experiment .",
    "it should also be noted that all the calculations lie below the experimental running sum of ref .",
    "@xcite that reaches the experimental value from the half - life already at 2  mev .",
    "as pointed out by the authors in that reference , the consequence of this is that any further contributions must be very small or must cancel each other .",
    "however , one should also take into account that the construction of the running sums in @xcite was based on summing the products of gt@xmath0 and gt@xmath4 matrix elements accumulated in different overlapping energy windows .",
    "this was done because the different resolutions of the experiments on the two branches and the lack of correlation between the gt@xmath0 and gt@xmath4 strengths do not allow a one - to - one correspondence between the states in @xmath1as excited from @xmath1ge and @xmath1se .",
