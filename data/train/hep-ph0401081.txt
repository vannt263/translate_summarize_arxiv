    "the proton is charged particle compound of the ( @xmath5 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) quarks and therefore it is non - point like . as a consequence one does nt know an explicit form of the proton matrix element of the electromagnetic ( em ) current @xmath7 and therefore the latter is parametrized @xmath8 trough dirac @xmath9 and pauli @xmath10 form factors ( ff s ) , where @xmath11 is a four momentum transferred by the virtual photon . from a practical point of view",
    "it is advantageous to introduce sach s ff s @xmath12 to be normalized to the proton charge @xmath13 and the proton magnetic moment @xmath14 ( @xmath15 $ ] is the proton anomalous magnetic moment ) and commonly they are called proton electric and proton magnetic ff s , respectively .",
    "prior to the year 2000 all data on @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the space - like ( @xmath18 ) region were obtained by measuring ( mainly at slac ) the differential cross - section of elastic electron scattering on proton @xmath19 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and utilizing the rosenbluth technique in order to separate @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in such a way obtained data up to almost @xmath0=-35 gev@xmath1 have with increased @xmath20 smooth fall and the ratio @xmath21@xmath22 has constant behavior at least up to @xmath23=6 gev@xmath1 , where the electric and magnetic proton ff s follow the dipole formula [ @xcite ] @xmath24    more recently [ @xcite ] jefferson lab data on @xmath25 , measuring simultaneously transverse @xmath26 and longitudinal @xmath27 components of the recoil proton s polarization in the electron scattering plane of the polarization transfer process @xmath28 , have been determined at the region @xmath29 by the relation @xmath30 which reveal a remarkable fall of @xmath31 ( see fig.1 ) with increased @xmath23 in comparison with @xmath32 and so , this data are in a rather strong disagreement with the data obtained by rosenbluth technique .    in this contribution we solve this puzzle by an investigation of a compatibility of new data with",
    "all known ff properties in the framework of our global unitary and analytic model of the nucleon em structure [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is till now the most sophisticated model [ @xcite ] for four independent analytic functions @xmath33+\\frac{t}{4m^2_p}[f_2^s(t)+f_2^v(t)]\\nonumber \\\\ g_{mp}(t)&=&[f_1^s+f_1^v(t)]+[f_2^s(t)+f_2^v(t)]\\label{a7 } \\\\ g_{en}(t)&=&[f_1^s(t)-f_1^v(t)]+\\frac{t}{4m^2_n}[f_2^s(t)-f_2^v(t)]\\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_{mp}(t)&=&[f_1^s - f_1^v(t)]+[f_2^s(t)-f_2^v(t)],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so - called electric and magnetic proton and neutron ff s , to be defined on four - sheeted riemann surface in @xmath0-variable with complex poles corresponding to unstable vector meson resonances placed only on unphysical sheets .",
    "the model contains all known ff properties like experimental fact of a creation of vector - meson resonances in electron - positron annihilation processes into hadrons , the assumed nucleon ff analytic properties , unitary condition , normalization @xmath34 and the asymptotic behaviour as predicted by quark model of hadrons @xmath35    in such a way it provides a very effective framework for a consistent superposition of complex conjugate vector - meson pole pair and continuum contributions with all other nucleon ff properties and describes well ( see figs .",
    "2,3 ) first time all existing space - like ( obtained by rosenbluth technique ) and time - like nucleon ff data simultaneously , despite of the fact that the obtained by rosenbluth technique data on electric proton ff @xmath16 in @xmath18 region are significantly less precise than the data on @xmath17 , since @xmath17 is dominant in differential cross - section ( [ a4 ] ) , from the experimental values of which both , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are extracted .",
    "from fig.1 it is straightforward to see , that @xmath36 fall is steeper than the fall of dipole formula , but less intense than tripole one .    knowing the ratio",
    "@xmath37 one can extract also data on the ratio @xmath38 by the expression @xmath39    then @xmath40 indicates continuing increase ( see fig.4 ) with @xmath23 .",
    "however , if we multiply the data on ratio @xmath38 only by q , then they acquire constant behaviour with @xmath23 .",
    "so , the new jlab proton polarization data indicate that the proton pauli ff has ( at least in the interval @xmath41 ) the behaviour @xmath42 which is in contradiction with the pqcd predictions [ @xcite],[@xcite ] @xmath43 if the latter is true , then from the definition of the proton electric ff ( [ a3 ] ) it follows that @xmath44 must to have a zero , i.e. diffraction minimum , at some higher @xmath23 .",
    "on the base of our analysis above we are now in the position :    * the data on @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath18 region , obtained by rosenbluth technique from @xmath45 , are compatible with all other existing nucleon ff data and all known ff properties , including also the qcd asymptotics . *",
    "the very precise jlab proton polarization data on @xmath46 contradict ( at least in the region @xmath47 ) predictions of pqcd .",
    "now , what data on @xmath16 in @xmath18 region are true and what data are wrong ?    in a solution of the latter problem we have proceeded as follows . since the magnetic proton ff @xmath32 is ( owing to the factor @xmath48 ) dominant at the differential cross - section ( [ a4 ] ) of @xmath49 ( at @xmath23=@xmath50 the electric proton ff contributes only 5@xmath51 to the cross - section value and for higher momenta it is even less ) , the obtained data on electric proton ff could be unreliable , even wrong .",
    "on the other hand , a simultaneous measurement of the transverse and longitudinal components of the recoil proton s polarization in the electron scattering plane of the polarization transfer process @xmath52 is very effective and reliable method of a determination of the ratio @xmath37 . as a result",
    "we believe in the obtained data presented in fig.1 and their violation of qcd asymptotics given by ( [ a11 ] ) we consider to be a local effect .",
    "this our conjecture we verify in the framework of the global unitary and analytic model of nucleon em structure which contains the qcd asymptotics automatically .",
    "first , we exclude from the set of all existing proton and neutron em ff data the space - like data on @xmath16 obtained from @xmath45 by rosenbluth technique .",
    "we substitute them for jlab proton polarization data on @xmath53 .",
    "then by means of the 10 -resonance unitary and analytic model of nucleon em structure [ @xcite ] we carry out a fitting procedure of all these data simultaneously which provides in such a way test of :    * consistency of the jlab proton polarization data with all other proton and neutron em ff data * consistency of these data with the powerful tool of physics - the analyticity * their consistency with the asymptotic behaviour as predicted ( up to logarithmic corrections ) by qcd .",
    "we have obtained very surprising results .",
    "a perfect description of the jlab proton polarization data ( see fig.5 ) was achieved . the fitted parameters of the unitary and analytic model of nucleon em structure are almost unchanged in comparison with those given in [ @xcite ] .",
    "a description of the @xmath16 time - like data , of all @xmath17 data and space - like and time - like neutron em ff data is ( see dashed lines in figs .",
    "6,7 ) changed very little .",
    "so , we come to the conclusion , that the jlab proton polarization data are consistent with all other existing nucleon em ff data besides space - like @xmath16 data obtained from @xmath54 by rosenbluth technique .",
    "they are consistent with analyticity and they do nt contradict the qcd asymptotics , however they strongly require an existence of the zero in @xmath55 ( i.e. a diffraction minimum well known in nuclear em ff s ) around @xmath56 .",
    "recent jlab proton polarization data on @xmath46 , obtained by a simultaneous measurement of the transverse and longitudinal components of the recoil proton s polarization in the electron scattering plane of the polarization transfer process @xmath57 at the region @xmath58 , revealed a remarkable fall of @xmath31 with increased @xmath23 , which contradicts previous @xmath16 data determined from @xmath59 by rosenbluth technique and so , also the qcd asymptotics .    discarding all @xmath16 data obtained by rosenbluth technique in space - like region we have analyzed new jlab proton polarized space - like data together with all other nucleon em ff data in the framework of the unitary and analytic model of the nucleon em structure from ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .    on the basis of the obtained results we came to the conclusions , that the jlab proton polarization data are consistent with all nucleon em ff data , besides space - like @xmath16 data obtained by rosenbluth technique , and also with qcd asymptotics , however , they require an existence of a zero ( i.e. diffraction minimum ) of @xmath55 around @xmath56 . so there is a challenge to experimental groups to confirm our conclusion by measuring @xmath46 at higher momenta",
