    "commodity markets are in their origins the prime and the most basic markets rooted in times when people were exchanging goods even before money was invented .",
    "today s commodity markets are mature and highly developed institutions , playing a very important role in modern economy .",
    "they are not only places of goods exchange , but also a theater of speculative activity .    nowadays , when we are used to highly sophisticated financial instruments , including credit derivatives , contracts for other contracts for some artificial underlying instruments , etc .",
    ", commodities seem to be rather old - fashioned . yet",
    ", they remain important , not only due to their being primary raw materials for other stages of economic activity , but also because they can be a reliable measure of value , especially in times of crisis or other historical turbulence .",
    "commodities , traded at free markets , follow the rules of the efficient market hypothesis @xcite , the same as stocks , currencies , and others",
    ". changes of their prices are , therefore , random and in major part unpredictable .",
    "a model which reflects this property is the geometric brownian motion of prices , the core of the black - scholes theory @xcite .",
    "however , real prices of financial assets deviate from the brownian behavior , what has been clearly shown by investigations using different tools of econophysics .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the absolute returns decays as a power law with an exponent @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the returns are weakly correlated @xcite and show persistent behavior of their sign @xcite .",
    "all those observations for stock markets should be also in general valid for commodity markets , despite observed differences such as a _ spatial arbitrage _",
    "effect @xcite , or different multifractal properties @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite showed also that the prices of commodity futures obey a different scaling law from the prices of spots .",
    "the former are more similar to stocks in this aspect .",
    "it is well known that stocks of different firms are mutually correlated in a way that can not be totally explained by the random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the correlation coefficients of stock price returns can be used to obtain a minimal spanning tree and associated with it a hierarchical tree of the subdominant ultrametric space , which was done by mantegna @xcite .",
    "he detected grouping of firms of a similar profile in the minimal spanning tree .",
    "this effect can be reproduced neither by the random model of uncorrelated time series , nor by the one - factor model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyzed cross - correlations in commodity markets .",
    "we created the correlation matrix and corresponding correlation - based metric .",
    "using the correlation metric we created a minimal spanning tree of investigated contracts , looking for sector clusterization .",
    "we also examined dynamic properties of correlations , finding out that commodity contracts were getting more and more correlated , and mean distances in a corresponding minimal spanning tree were smaller and smaller in the course of time .",
    "however , individual contracts contributed to the increase of mean correlation differently .",
    "their idiosyncratic contribution to the correlations was characterized by an introduced quantity ( strength ) and its evolution .",
    "the motivation for our research was a growing interest of investors and mass media in commodity markets . skyrocketing oil prices",
    "were expected to reach the level of 200 usd per barrel during one week , and went down under 100 usd during another .",
    "we wanted to investigate the behavior of the commodity markets with the tools of complex system physics .",
    "we found the mirroring of the specific situation of last years in a time dependent picture of commodity prices correlations .",
    "we investigated 35 future contracts for commodities traded at different markets .",
    "futures rather than spots were examined as the data were more accessible .",
    "we used data from : chicago board of trade ( cbot ) , chicago mercantile exchange ( cme ) , intercontinentalexchange ( ice ) , kansas city board of trade ( kcbt ) , london metal exchange ( lme ) , minneapolis grain exchange ( mgex ) , new york board of trade ( nybot ) , new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) , winnipeg commodity exchange ( wce ) . for today",
    "s investors in the globalized world market a contract traded in london or in chicago is only another financial instrument that they can buy or sell no matter where .",
    "table [ tab_list ] presents the list of investigated contracts , their symbols , and symbols of corresponding markets .",
    "all the contracts were quoted in usd .",
    "we took under consideration day closing prices .",

    "choosing a time window @xmath1 for correlations calculation is always a compromise choice between a level of noise from one side and a good estimation of temporal correlation from the other .",
    "increasing @xmath1 reduces the noise level , but it gives an average correlation coefficient of the whole window .",
    "the correlation coefficients evolve in time and the corresponding mst shrinks during a stock market crisis @xcite .",
    "some dynamical aspects of correlations were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we divided the period 1998.09.01 - 2007.12.14 into three subperiods of equal lengths and created mst for this data , computing also strengths of the contracts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sw1 ] - [ fig : sw3 ] ) .",
    "the tree changed , but branch clusterization remained .",
    "a change in strength of the strongest nodes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sily ] . to check whether the change is caused by a real trend , and not by fluctuations , we recalculated the strength for the same time window starting 7 days earlier , and 7 days later .",
    "the results , providing the scope of the strength change , enabled us to include errorbars in figure [ fig : sily ] .",
    "the errorbars appeared to be negligible compared to the change of the strength .",
    "it means that while shifting the time window by 7 days the strength remained almost unchanged .",
    "all presented contracts increased their strengths , especially gold whose increase was most abrupt .",
    "a more detailed view on the strength evolution can be obtained by applying a moving time window analysis .",
    "we calculated strengths of contracts for a time window @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : st_ew ] ) .",
    "contracts of the same branch obey similar changes . except for animal products , which did not change significantly ,",
    "all contracts increased their strengths within the investigated period .",
    "also the shape of the evolution curve proves that the observed change is the effect of real trend rather than fluctuations .",
    "we also calculated betweenness centrality for each tree treated as an unweighted network ( fig .",
    "[ rys_betweenness ] ) .",
    "one can observe a monotonic betweenness decrease of corn , copper , soybean , and an increase of gold betweenness .",
    "there can also be observed an abrupt increase of crude oil betweenness .",
    "the change in the picture of correlations can be caused by noise fluctuation or by a real evolution of market trends . because our time series are long , compared to their numbers ( @xmath3 )",
    ", we suspect that we observed a trend evolution rather than fluctuations .",
    "we investigated the evolution of the mean correlation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a correlation coefficient for a time window @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "a constant upgoing trend is visible ( fig .",
    "[ rys_mc ] ) .",
    "its interpretation is quite obvious - the mean correlation increased significantly in the investigated period .",
    "we also calculated the variance of the correlation coefficients : @xmath7 it is usually positively correlated with the mean correlation @xcite .    during financial crashes a growth of the mean correlation can be observed @xcite .",
    "we can see in the investigated period a constant growth of @xmath8 .",
    "we calculated @xmath9 and @xmath10 for a longer period , i.e. 1990.04.03 - 2007.12.14 with a smaller set of contracts ( fig .",
    "[ rys_mc2 ] ) .",
    "we used only @xmath11 contracts that had been traded through the whole period .",
    "the mean correlation was fluctuating between @xmath12 and @xmath13 until the year 2003 , next , it started a constant growth to the value @xmath14 at the end of 2007 .",
    "let us define the mean occupation layer @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the level of vertex @xmath17 .",
    "the level measures the distance ( in nodes ) to the central vertex ( which is of level 0 ) .",
    "each time we chose as the central vertex one that minimizes the mean occupation layer @xmath18 .",
    "this measure characterizes compactness of mst , which usually shrinks during abrupt price changes ( eg . crisis ) .",
    "this effect can be observed as a decrease of the @xmath18 value .",
    "evolution of mean occupation layer @xmath18 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly ] .",
    "one can see large fluctuations of both values .",
    "no constant trend can be found .",
    "both values are correlated with the correlation coefficient @xmath19 .    the arbitrage pricing theory @xcite modells returns of financial assets as a linear function of different macro - economic factors .",
    "such factors can be identified with eigenvectors of a correlation matrix .",
    "the largest eigenvector corresponds to an economic factor which has the most significant impact on the market .",
    "the level of this impact can be measured by a corresponding eigenvalue normalized by the sum of all eigenvalues . if we take a portfolio of contracts which is a mixture of eigenvectors with equal weights , this value would present the fraction of portfolio variance explained by the first factor .",
    "the evolution of normalized largest eigenvalue is presented in fig . [",
    "fig : ew_f ] .",
    "the observed increase means that the influence of the first factor became even stronger with time , which caused the observed increase of the mean correlation ( fig .",
    "[ rys_mc ] ) .",
    "we plotted evolution of the first eigenvector components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_f2 ] ) which can be treated as an influence of the first factor on a given commodity .",
    "it strongly decreased for plant products , increased for metals and fuels , and remained almost unchanged for animals . while growing influence of the first factor resulted in the increase of mean correlation",
    ", changes of eigenvector components drove the evolution of strength parameters .",
    "it seems to be clear for metals , fuels and animals .",
    "however , for the case of plants we observed a decrease of first eigenvector components . at the same time the largest eigenvalue increased .",
    "the two opposite tendencies resulted in slight increase of strengths of plants .",
    "we analyzed the correlation matrix of commodity prices .",
    "due to long time series the level of noise in correlation matrix was low .",
    "two eigenvectors of @xmath20 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalues were plotted .",
    "the picture ( [ rys_eigenvectors ] ) visualizes a clustering structure of correlations . using a correlation metric @xmath21 we created mst of investigated contracts .",
    "mst provides clear evidence for the existence of strong correlations of commodities within a given sector and for intersector correlations depending on the level of similarity .",
    "the above picture of correlations could be expected from similar studies of stock markets and currencies .",
    "more interesting are investigated dynamical properties of correlations which , as we observed , changed in time . in the studied period",
    "i.e. 1998.09.01 - 2007.12.14 the mean correlation ( [ mean_corr ] ) increased from about @xmath22 to about @xmath23 .",
    "the reason for this correlation increase can be as follows .",
    "commodity markets attracted a lot of investors attention in the last years .",
    "a growing demand for energy , metals , and food from fast developing chinese and indian economy created a boom for commodities and an impulse for intensive speculations .",
    "this market boom makes prices follow one direction , which resulted in increase of correlation between the traded assets . a similar effect was observed during market crashes @xcite .",
    "the effect of the boom for commodities is responsible for the observed growth of mean correlation coefficient .",
    "the mean correlation calculated as an average measure increased , but the contributions of individual contracts to this difference were various .",
    "we introduced strength of a contract expressing the magnitude of its correlation with other contracts .",
    "strengths calculation for moving time window visualised the evolution of this parameter .",
    "it turned out that metals and fuels importantly participated in the increase of strength , while animals almost remained unchanged .",
    "it is obvious that prices of financial assets are driven by several economic factors . among them",
    "there is the most significant factor , called by us the first factor .",
    "a measure of importance of the factor can be a corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "we showed that the role of the first factor was getting stronger , so the market finally became more and more one - factored .",
    "this fact , that can be observed in the increase of the first eigenvalue , is also responsible for the increase of correlations , characterized by the mean correlation parameter .",
    "that effect was caused by a growing price bubble .",
    "we also observed the change of the first factor itself , or from the other viewpoint , the change of its influence on specific commodities .",
    "the first eigenvector components evolved in time in a way that depends on the commodity branch . contracts which became significantly more dependend on the first factor , that is metals and fuels , became also stronger .",
    "contracts with weak interactions with the first factor , like animals , did not change their relatively low strengths .",
    "we studied correlations of commodity contracts returns .",
    "our analysis showed that starting from the year 2003 the commodity market became more correlated , and was driven by a single economic factor .",
    "the dependence on the factor got stronger with time .",
    "the result is most pronounced in an evolution of the largest eigenvalue normalized by the sum of all eigenvalues , and it can be also seen in the evolution of contracts strengths and their mean correlation .",
    "the most important result seems to be the clear evidence of the constantly increasing market synchronization .",
    "this fact can be even related to the global scale of current economic crisis .",
    "however , the authors can not suggest that they found roots of recent dramatic market changes .",
    "it was expected that dynamics of commodities belonging to the same sector would be clustered , i.e. would be closely placed in the mst .",
    "one could however not predict in advance which of commodities would become synchronized with the first eigenvalue ( a market mode ) .",
    "it is surprising that the agriculture products behaved differently compared to metals that became much more synchronized .",
    "an obvious implication from our study is the increasing risk for market players that can not effectively diversify their portfolios , since corresponding assets are more and more correlated .",
    "it is well known that such correlations modify substantially the optimal portfolios and make diversification more difficult since the effective number of asses became smaller @xcite .",
