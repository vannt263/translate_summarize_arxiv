    "magnetism and unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) as well as the intimate interplay between them have been the focuses of condensed matter physics for decades due to their rich physics and important applications . among these subjects , the realizations of itinerant ferromagnetism ( fm ) and triplet sc",
    "are of particular importance in recent years . in general",
    ", the triplet sc @xcite , which is connected with topological sc @xcite and becomes hot topic recently , is believed to be driven by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations near the fm order .",
    "however , the realization of itinerant fm from the stoner criterion @xcite usually requires finite and , most of the time , strong electron interactions @xcite , which is hard to deal with in the weak coupling perturbative approaches . one way to overcome this difficulty is through the introducing of divergent density of states ( dos ) at the van hove ( vh ) singularities of the system , which can induce these instabilities without strong electronic interactions .",
    "it s proposed recently that , for a system with its fermi surface ( fs ) doped to time - reversal ( tr ) variant vh saddle points , weak repulsive electron interactions can usually drive itinerant fm and triplet sc @xcite .    on another front , as the si - based counterpart of graphene",
    ", silicene has been synthesized recently @xcite , with experimental evidence showing possible sc in the doped case @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bilayer silicene ( bls ) has also been available @xcite , with the energetically most favored stacking way between its two layers identified by first - principles calculations @xcite . based on the metallic band structure of undoped bls , the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) and the chiral @xmath0 sc tuned by strain",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "this intriguing result motivates us to further investigate the electronic instabilities in doped bls , specifically focusing on the vh doping levels since the divergent dos there favors the occurrence of electronic instabilities . paying our attention to vh doping",
    ", we notice that , in vh - doped monolayer graphene whose vh saddle points locate at tr invariant momenta , the chiral spin density wave or the chiral @xmath0 pairing has been proposed @xcite .",
    "similar results have also been found in monolayer silicene @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the interesting property of the vh singularities here in bls lies in that the vh saddle points locate at tr variant momenta . for such vh singularities",
    ", the study based on the renormalization group theory has pointed out the possibility of the formation of itinerant fm and triplet sc @xcite .    in this paper , we perform the calculations based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to investigate possible electronic instabilities of doped bls .",
    "the main results of our calculations are as follows .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 sc occurring at low doping levels , the itinerant fm and the triplet @xmath1 sc emerge as the leading instabilities of the system in the narrow doping regions around the vh singularities and the vicinity of these regions respectively . in the presence of a weak kane - mele spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , the helical @xmath1 pairing becomes the leading instability of the system .",
    "the emergence of the fm and the triplet sc results from the large dos and the strong ferromagnetic correlation near the vh singularities . near the critical doping level separating the fm and triplet sc",
    ", the strong ferromagnetic fluctuations will greatly enhance the superconducting critical temperature , which provides possibility to realize this triplet @xmath1 pairing state at experimentally accessible temperatures .",

    "iv , we study the superconducting pairing symmetries for different doping levels , and propose that the @xmath1 pairing dominates over the @xmath0 one in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic regions . finally in sec .",

    "a special feature of the vh singularities of this material lies in that its vh saddle points locate on the m-@xmath45 axes rather than at the tr invariant m - points as in bilayer graphene as well as monolayer graphene or silicene .",

    "the  type - ii \" vh singularities is special in that it allows for the formation of triplet sc .",
    "if the fs of a system contains tr invariant  type - i \" vh saddle points , the triplet pairing will not be energetically favored because its odd parity gap function will have nodes at these tr invariant vh momenta , which is no good for the energy gain .",
    "on the contrary , the tr variant  type - ii \" vh saddle points of bls locating on the m-@xmath45 axes provide the possibility for the system to enter the triplet pairing state .    to study the electron instabilities of this system represented by the hubbard model ( [ model ] ) , we adopt the standard multi - orbital rpa approach @xcite .",

    "the hermitian static susceptibility matrix is defined as @xmath63 . for each @xmath64 ,",

    "such a doping evolution of the susceptibility originates from the evolution of the fs mentioned before , and indicates that the intra - sublattice spin correlation of the system changes gradually with doping from ferromagnetic first to antiferromagnetic , and finally back to ferromagnetic again .    from the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath66",
    ", we finds that the spin correlation within a unit cell is ferromagnetic - like ( see fig .",

    "<S> in contrast to the singlet @xmath0 superconductivity at the low doping region , we find that the system is an itinerant ferromagnet in the narrow doping regions around the van hove singularities , and a triplet @xmath1 superconductor in the vicinity of these regions . adding a weak kane - mele spin - orbit coupling to the system further singles out the time - reversal invariant equal - spin helical @xmath1 pairing as the leading instability . </S>",
    "<S> the triplet pairing identified here is driven by the ferromagnetic fluctuations , which become strong and enhance the superconducting critical temperature remarkably near the phase boundaries between ferromagnetism and superconductivity . </S>"
