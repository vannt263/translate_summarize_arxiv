    "the discovery of new superconductors in unexpected materials brings the potential to understand something deeper , or perhaps something different , about the underlying properties that favor superconducting pairing .",
    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity ( to 56 k so far ) in fe - pnictides@xcite is a recent spectacular example , and is also an example of close relationships between magnetism and superconductivity , though the connections are still far from clear .",
    "new superconductors where little or no magnetic effects are present are also arising , and these clearly involve different physics from the cuprate or fe - pnictide high - temperature superconductors .",
    "electron - doped mncl , where m = zr or hf , becomes superconducting immediately upon undergoing the insulator - to - metal transition,@xcite which , in the case of m = hf , is higher than 25 k. the similarly layered , electron - doped , ionic insulator tincl superconducts up to 16 k. magnetic behavior in these materials is at most subtle , amounting to an enhancement in pauli susceptibility near the metal - to - insulator transition.@xcite    in this paper we address the ternary silicide naalsi ( space group _ p4/nmm _ , @xmath3 ) , another ionic and layered material that shows unexpected superconductivity , and does so in its native ( without doping or pressure ) stoichiometric state , at 7 k.@xcite naalsi introduces new interest from several viewpoints .",
    "first , it is an @xmath0 electron superconductor , with a high @xmath4 for such materials at ambient pressure .",
    "pb is an @xmath0 superconductor with comparable @xmath4 ( 7.2 k ) but with simple metallic bonding and heavy atoms , making it very different .",
    "doped si@xcite and doped diamond@xcite superconduct in the same range , and are of course very different classes of materials .",
    "a more relevant example is the pseudo - ternary compound ba@xmath5k@xmath6bio@xmath7 ( bkbo ) , which undergoes an insulator - to - metal transition for @xmath8 , beyond which its @xmath4 surpasses 30 k. [ ]    second , the al - si layered substructure is like that of the feas layer in the fe - pnictide superconductors , raising the possibility of some connections between their electronic structures .",
    "in fact , naalsi has the same structure as the fe - pnictide  111 \" compounds , with al being tetrahedrally coordinated by si ( analogous to fe being tetrahedrally coordinated by as ) . in spite of their structural similarities ,",
    "these compounds have major differences ; for example , the fe pnictides are @xmath9 electron systems with magnetism , while naalsi is an @xmath0 electron system without magnetism .",
    "third , naalsi is the isovalent sister ( one row down in the periodic table for each atom ) of libc .",
    "libc itself is ( in a sense ) isovalent and also isostructural to mgb@xmath10 ; however due to the b - c alternation around the hexagon in the honeycomb - structure layer , libc is insulating rather than conducting . when hole - doped while retaining the same structure , li@xmath5bc has stronger electron - phonon coupling than does mgb@xmath10.@xcite while naalsi has a substantially different structure than libc , its isovalence and its combination of covalence with some ionic character is shared with libc .",
    "yet another closely related compound is caalsi , whose two different stacking polymorphs and parent structure superconduct in the 58 k range.@xcite linear - response and frozen - mode calculations indicate electron - phonon coupling is the likely mechanism ; in particular , an ultra - soft phonon mode appears and is suggested to play a role in the superconductivity.@xcite it is curious that in this compound , where divalent ca ( comparing it with naalsi ) contributes one additional electron into the si - al @xmath0 bands , the preferred structure is that of alb@xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ , mgb@xmath10 ) with @xmath11 planar bonding@xcite rather than the more @xmath12-like bonding in naalsi .",
    "electronic structure calculations show that caalsi has one electron in the conduction band above a bonding - antibonding band separation at the naalsi band - filling level , a situation which would not appear to be particularly favorable for @xmath11 bonding .    in this paper",
    "we analyze first - principles electronic structure calculations that reveal that naalsi is a naturally self - doped semimetal , with doping occurring  thus charge transfer occurring  between covalent bands within the al - si substructure , and two - dimensional ( 2d ) free - electron - like bands within the al layer .",
    "the resulting small fermi surfaces ( fss ) are unusual , complicated by the small but seemingly important interlayer coupling along the crystalline @xmath2-axis .",
    "first - principles , local density approximation ( lda ) calculations were carried out using the full - potential local - orbital ( fplo ) scheme.@xcite a @xmath13-point mesh of @xmath14 was used , and the perdew - wang 92 approximation@xcite was applied for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the experimental lattice constants obtained by kuroiwa _ _ et al.__@xcite ( @xmath15    and @xmath16   ) and internal coordinates published by westerhaus and schuster@xcite ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) were used in our calculations .",
    "the calculated band structure of naalsi is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , the na ion gives up its electron to the si - al - si trilayer ( see fig .  [ structure ] ) , which may have some ionic character , though it is not easy to quantify ( the valence bands have much more si character than al character , seemingly more than suggested by their number of valence electrons )",
    ". there are several readily identifiable classes of bands .",
    "two primarily si @xmath1 bands , with a small amount of al @xmath1 character , are centered 9 ev below the fermi level @xmath19 and have a width of 2.5 ev . above them",
    "there is a six - band complex of al - si @xmath20-@xmath21 bands ( heavily si ) that are very nearly filled , the band maximum only slightly overlapping @xmath19 .",
    "character of bands is indicated by broadening .",
    "a doubly degenerate pair of broad bands is evident along the @xmath22-m direction .",
    "middle panel : al @xmath23 character is weak below 23 ev .",
    "bottom panel : si @xmath1 ( black ) bands below @xmath24 ev , and si @xmath23 in the valence bands and lower conduction bands . ]    above @xmath19 lie non - bonding and antibonding bands , and the na @xmath20 bands . among these",
    "there are a pair of distinctive bands , which can be identified most easily by their al @xmath20 character in the top panel of fig .",
    "these bands are nearly free - electron - like with large dispersions , and cross many other bands with little mixing .",
    "along @xmath22-m they are degenerate and easily identifiable in fig .",
    "[ bs ] , as they disperse up through the fermi level to nearly 10 ev at the m point .",
    "along @xmath22-x , and similarly at the top of the zone z - r , they are distinct : one again disperses upward rapidly , cutting through many other bands , also to nearly 10 ev at x ; the other disperses much more weakly to x , with a bandwidth of about 2 ev .",
    "their al @xmath20 character and nearly vanishing si character identify these as free - electron states , in which electrons move down channels of al atoms separately in @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions .",
    "( note that their lack of @xmath27 dispersion identifies them as planar bands . )",
    "there is some coupling to the states in a parallel channel of al atoms , giving rise to the 2 ev transverse dispersion .",
    "these bands lie 0.5 ev below @xmath19 at @xmath22 and contain electrons . without interference with other bands near the fermi level and supposing them to be isotropic in the plane ( but see below ) , such fss might include 34% of the area of the zone , which would equate to an intrinsic electron doping for two bands , both spins of around 0.120.16 carriers per unit cell , and the concentration of hole carriers would be equal .",
    "the anisotropy , discussed below , makes the actual carrier concentration much lower .",
    "the small overlap of valence and conduction bands results in semimetallic character and small fermi surfaces .",
    "the valence bands are quite anisotropic . looking at the valence bands along @xmath22-x , one might try to characterize them as one `` heavy - hole '' and one `` light - hole '' band , degenerate at @xmath22 , with the band maximum lying 0.13  ev above @xmath19 .",
    "however , the heavy hole band is actually almost perfectly flat for the first third of the @xmath22-x line , before dispersing downward across @xmath19 and farther below . due to this flatness",
    ", the band can not be characterized by an effective mass .",
    "the conduction bands contribute the pair of light electron bands described above .",
    "in addition , one conduction band dips slightly below the fermi level along @xmath22-m near m.    the fatbands representation in fig .",
    "[ bs ] that reveals the dominant band character shows that the si @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and al @xmath1 orbitals dominate the valence states near @xmath19 . as anticipated from consideration of the layered structure as mentioned earlier , the electronic structure is quasi-2d , with generally small dispersion along @xmath27 near @xmath19 .",
    "however , the small @xmath27 dispersion of one band is important in determining the geometry of the fss , as discussed in more detail below .     and",

    "[ dos ] shows the total , partial , and projected densities of states ( dos ) of naalsi .",
    "the na contribution near the fermi level is negligible and thus not shown . except for a strong dip ( `` pseudogap '' ) near the fermi level and a less severe dip in the @xmath30 to @xmath31 ev range",
    ", the dos hovers around 3 states / ev throughout both valence and conduction bands . within the pseudogap encompassing the fermi energy , there is an anomalous sharp and narrow peak with @xmath19 lying on its upper slope , as noted previously by kuroiwa _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the value of @xmath32 is 1.1 states / ev . we discuss below the fss of both hole ( si ) and electron ( al ) character .",
    "it seems clear that the transport properties and low - energy properties ( which have not yet been reported ) , and in particular the superconductivity of naalsi , are intimately associated with this sharp and narrow peak in the dos , which includes the fermi level .",
    "the projected dos shows the flat bands that give rise to this peak are very strongly si - derived .",
    "there is al @xmath1 character that turns on just below @xmath19 , but it is relatively small compared to the si character at @xmath19 , and its magnitude remains low and nearly constant through the peak .",
    "there is al @xmath23 character of the same magnitude in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the top edge of the peak coincides with the flat band along @xmath22-x at 0.13 ev .",
    "the width of the peak , about 0.35 ev , must be due to dispersion and anticrossings that are mostly not visible along symmetry directions and arise from mixing away from symmetry lines of the valence and conduction bands .",
    "nonetheless , the slope of the dos at @xmath19 is rather steep , and this may give rise to high thermopower for the material .",
    "the standard low - temperature limit of thermopower ( the seebeck coefficient tensor ) * s*@xmath33 in semiclassical bloch - boltzmann theory is @xmath34 the conductivity tensor @xmath35 can be written in terms of the average velocity ( @xmath36 ) product , dos , and scattering time @xmath37 over the constant energy ( @xmath38 ) surface : @xmath39 the thermopower thus picks up contributions from the energy variation of three quantities : the dyadic product @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath37 .",
    "often the energy dependence of @xmath42 is neglected , out of lack of detailed knowledge , though it also can be argued to follow roughly @xmath43 for elastic scattering .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath44 also counteracts the energy dependence of @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless it is observed that materials with large slope in @xmath41 frequently have large thermopower . for naalsi",
    "we calculate @xmath45 ev@xmath46 .",
    "this value can be compared with other materials that have fine structure near the fermi level : tibe@xmath10 , where @xmath47 = 1012 ev@xmath46 and @xmath32 also is much larger;@xcite and mgcni@xmath7 with its very impressive peak very near @xmath19 , for which @xmath47",

    "[ seebeck ] can also be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is ( a diagonal element of ) the inverse mass tensor ( second derivative of @xmath52 ) averaged over the constant energy surface .",
    "this form makes it clear that the expressions should , for any quantitative estimate , be generalized to two - band form , since the valence and conduction bands have differing signs of their effective masses , and the scattering time  and its energy variation  is likely to be very different for si - derived covalent valence bands and al - derived free - electron conduction bands .",

    "although the bands show little dispersion along @xmath22-z , the bands just above the the fermi level are quite different depending on whether @xmath57 or @xmath58 . in particular , the lowest band along r - a is rather flat , but the lowest conduction band along x - m has a dispersion of nearly 2 ev .",
    "similar comparisons can be made for the bands along @xmath22-x and z - r .",

    "moreover , in both compounds , the relevant bands involve only the ( si - al - si or as - fe - as ) trilayer .",
    "the top view of the fan - blade surfaces have characteristics in common with those of some of the fe pnictides,@xcite all of which have this same trilayer .",
    "the similarity is that the top view of the fan blades ( if one ignores the diamond - shaped cutout at the intersection , centered at @xmath22 ) appears to show intersecting fss , neither of which has the square symmetry of the lattice .    such occurrence of intersecting fss , each with lower symmetry than the lattice , has been analyzed for lafeaso ( a `` 1111 '' compound ) by yaresko _",
    "et al._@xcite a symmetry of the fe@xmath10as@xmath10 ( also al@xmath10si@xmath10 ) substructure is a non - primitive translation connecting fe atoms ( respectively , al atoms ) followed by @xmath60-reflection .",
    "this operation leads to symmetries that allow @xmath57 bands to be unfolded into a larger brillouin zone ( that is , a `` smaller unit cell '' having only one fe atom ) which _ un_folds the band structure and the intersecting fss .",
    "the naalsi fss appear to have this similar crossing ( albeit interrupted by the free - electron bands ) , and the highly anisotropic dispersion is due to distinct ( but symmetry - related ) hopping along each of the crystal axes . in this respect naalsi may clarify the electronic structure of the pnictides : by analogy , there are separate bands that disperse more strongly along the @xmath61 direction or the @xmath62 direction , and give rise to the intersecting , symmetry - related surfaces . in naalsi",
    "the bands are much more anisotropic in the plane ( approaching one - dimensional ) , making such character much clearer .",

    "the largest contribution to near - neighbor hopping in the al - si plane between @xmath65 and @xmath64 or @xmath65 is most likely due to this ring structure , as the @xmath21 lobes are confined to the inside of a square of near - neighbor al atoms , which are only edge sharing with the nearest si atoms along @xmath67 vectors .",

    "<S> isostructural naalge , which is not superconducting above 1.6 k , has almost exactly the same band structure except for one missing piece of small fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> certain deformation potentials induced by si and na displacements along the @xmath2-axis are calculated and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that the mechanism of pairing is related to that of several other lightly doped two - dimensional nonmagnetic semiconductors ( tincl , zrncl , hfncl ) , which is not well understood but apparently not of phonon origin . </S>"
