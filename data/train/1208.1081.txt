    "understanding the spin transport phenomena is one of the most important issues in the fast developing field of spintronics@xcite since it is crucial to the realization of the spintronic devices , such as spin - field - effect transistor.@xcite in the proposed datta - das transistor,@xcite the `` on '' and `` off '' states , distinguished by a @xmath1-phase difference in the spin precession mode , are switched by the gate voltage which controls the coherent spin precession ( csp ) of the passing carriers via the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc)@xcite acting as an effective magnetic field .",
    "to implement such devices , it is required that one is able to control and maintain spin polarization over a long enough distance , preferably at room temperature .",
    "experimentally , the real space spin transport in semiconductor is studied by using magneto - optic imaging,@xcite or through conductance / current modulation.@xcite an important development in the quantitative study of the spin transport is carried out by using spin transient grating spectroscopy.@xcite in these experiments , a spin density wave ( sdw ) with initial spin polarization @xmath2 is created by two orthogonal linear polarized light beams at time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wave vector of the sdw and @xmath5 is the position . under the influence of an applied in - plane electric field and the soc , sdw picks up a phase and evolves into @xmath6 . by optically monitoring the temporal evolution of the amplitude @xmath7 , one obtains the spin diffusion coefficient and relaxation rate.@xcite very recently ,",
    "the spin drifting and csp were studied by the doppler velocimetry which monitors the phase shift @xmath0.@xcite for pure spin drift without spin precession , the phase shift is simply @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the drift velocity .",
    "the linear increase of phase shift with time is equivalent to a doppler shift @xmath10 . when both the csp and drifting are present , the phase shift deviates from this simple relation and behaves anomalously . in ref .",
    "[ ] , yang _",
    "et al . _ reported that at low temperature ( @xmath11  k ) , @xmath0 deviates strongly from the simple relation of @xmath12 and clearly shows the anomalous behavior caused by the csp .",
    "however , once the temperature rises to 150  k , the anomalous behavior of the phase shift disappears in the time frame of the observation .",
    "it was then concluded that csp breaks down at high temperature , although the mechanism of the disappearance of csp is not clear.@xcite the disappearance of csp at high temperature was claimed to be in consistence with the previous experimental results in the prototypes of datta - das transistors.@xcite    the temporal evolution of the sdw contains all of the important information of spin transport , such as spin diffusion coefficient , spin mobility and csp .",
    "the transient spin grating spectroscopy together with the doppler velocimetry therefore enable one to quantitatively study the spin transport in semiconductors .",
    "however , the dynamics of sdw is quite complex when spatial inhomogeneity , applied electric field as well as the soc are present . to correctly extract the information from the experimental data , a thorough understanding of spin transport is in demand . without the electric field ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath7 decays biexponentially when the sdw diffuses along the @xmath13 $ ] crystal axis in ( 001 ) gaas quantum wells ( qws ) as spin rotates along the net effective magnetic field due to the soc and diffusion.@xcite based on the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite it is shown that the information about spin diffusion coefficient , csp and spin relaxation can be extracted from the wave - vector dependence of the two decay rates.@xcite in this paper we will further extend the theory to include the electric field and show , both analytically and numerically , that the theoretical and experimental results agree well with each other .",
    "we will demonstrate that the csp is robust even in high temperature regime for narrow qws and point out that to observe the effect of the csp at high temperature , one has to carry out the observation for a longer time than the case at low temperature .",
    "as will be shown later , the sdw transporting along the @xmath13 $ ] crystal axis with the wave vector @xmath4 in a @xmath14 gaas qw evolves as @xmath15/2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } \\times \\bigl\\{e^{-2dqq_0t}\\cos[qx - v_d(q+q'_0)t ] \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\mbox { } +   e^{2dqq_0t}\\cos[qx - v_d(q - q'_0)t ]    \\bigr\\ } \\ ; ,    \\label{eq : sdw_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the soc is weak enough .",
    "here @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath9 are the spin diffusion coefficient , spin relaxation time of the sdw and the drift velocity under the electric field @xmath18 , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 representing the effective mass",

    "the situation is more complex . for small time @xmath29 ,",
    "the fast and the slow modes share the same weights . therefore the phase shift of the sdw reads @xmath30/2    = v_dqt \\;.\\ ] ] nevertheless , for large time @xmath31 , the slow mode dominates and the phase shift becomes @xmath32 that is , in the presence of the csp , the phase shift first changes linearly with a slope @xmath28 , same as the normal doppler one without the csp . after some time , the slope deviates from the normal one and reduces to @xmath33 .",

    "the phase approaches a stationary value at large time .",
    "the crossover time of @xmath0 from the normal doppler behavior in the early stage to the anomalous one at the later stage is about @xmath36 . in the case of small diffusion coefficient ,",

    "equation  ( [ eq : sdw_t ] ) captures all of the qualitative features of the experimental results@xcite at low temperature , from the two modes in the temporal evolution of sdw when @xmath37 ( hence @xmath25 ) , to the details of how the phase changes with time and wave vector when @xmath38 .",
    "specifically , the temporal evolution of the phase can be divided into two stages . in the early stage ,",
    "the phase increases with time with a steeper slope .",
    "the slope becomes flatter in the later stage , or even reverses its sign for small wave vectors .",
    "the larger the wave vector is , the quicker the phase behavior changes from the early stage to the later stage .",
    "all these features qualitatively agree with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdw_t ] ) .    as a result of the increasing electron - phonon scattering and spin coulomb drag,@xcite",
    "the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath16 decreases with the increase of temperature .",
    "it is therefore expected that at high temperature the crossover time is larger than that at low temperature . with the correction of the cubic dresselhaus term",
    ", @xmath39 also reduces as the temperature rises and the crossover time is further prolonged . if the contribution from the cubic dresselhaus term is so large that @xmath39 approaches zero , then the csp breaks down completely at high temperature . in the recent experiments ,",
    "the csp is thought to be broken down at high temperature based on the lack of the clear anomalous behavior in the phase shift from the observation in a limited time regime .",
    "the cubic dresselhaus term is speculated to be the main cause for the breaking down.@xcite however , this is highly unlikely because @xmath39 at low temperature only differs by a few percents from the one at high temperature for the narrow qw used in the experiments .",
    "it should be pointed out that , since the behaviors of phase in the early stage are the same with or without the csp , one should be cautious in determining the existence of such csp from the experimental data in limited time regime , especially when the crossover time @xmath40 is large . in our opinion , purely from the existing experiments , it is inconclusive to determine whether the csp survives or not at high temperature .    to derive the solution [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdw_t ] ) ] and to determine if the csp is stable at high temperature , we turn to the full ksbes for the spin transport in a ( 001 ) gaas qw grown along the @xmath41-axis@xcite @xmath42 + \\left.{\\partial \\rho_{\\mathbf{k}}(x , t)\\over    \\partial t}\\right|_{\\mathtt{s}}. \\label{eq : kinetic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assume that the transport direction is along the @xmath5-axis .",

    "note that we have included the corrections from the cubic dresselhaus term .    by expanding the density matrix @xmath54 ,",

    "the result is similar to the one without the applied electric field : the temporal evolution of @xmath82 is composed of two modes , with decay rates being @xmath88 respectively.@xcite for small electric field , the difference between the decay rates is quadratic in the field .",
    "therefore , the electric field has only marginal effect on the decay rates .",
    "however , the electric field introduces additional spin precession , causing @xmath82 to oscillate with frequency @xmath89 which is linear to the electric field for small field . in the case with @xmath90 , such as in the system with weak soc or in the special case when @xmath91 ( in these cases @xmath92 becomes very large ) , the solution can be further simplified to @xmath93 and @xmath94 one then gets time evolution of the sdw as eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdw_t ] ) .",

    "for wave vector - dependent spin relaxation times at @xmath11  k , shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : phase](a ) , the theoretical and experimental results are also in very good agreement . to see the effect of the csp , we plot the phase shifts @xmath0 of the sdw under the influence of an applied electric field of @xmath111  v / cm at different gratings as function of time in fig .",
