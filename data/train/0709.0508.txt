    "one of the major challenges in nuclear many - body theory is to develop a microscopic and systematic approach that would account for the most relevant correlations in the description of nuclear properties .",
    "most existing methods can be divided into two major classes : the self - consistent mean field ( scmf ) approximation  @xcite , also known as density functional theory ( dft ) , and the configuration - interaction shell model ( cism ) approach  @xcite .",
    "scmf theories are often cast in terms of an energy density functional that is minimized to obtain the ground - state solution of the system . there",
    "exist parameterizations of this energy density functional that are valid globally through the table of nuclei .",
    "such parametrizations are usually based on the zero - range skyrme force  @xcite or on the gogny interaction  @xcite .",
    "the cism approach requires as input a large number of interaction matrix elements in a truncated space .",
    "while effective cism interactions can sometimes be traced back to the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction , it is often necessary to adjust them empirically . since the cism method requires a truncation to a finite number of shells , the single - particle energies and interaction matrix elements are specific to the mass region under consideration .",
    "thus the cism approach lacks the global validity of the scmf .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cism approach has the advantage that the underlying nuclear wave functions ( both ground and excited states ) are fully correlated .",
    "complete @xmath5 major shell calculations in @xmath6-  @xcite , @xmath1-  @xcite and @xmath7-shell  @xcite nuclei have successfully described many of the observed properties of these nuclei . in contrast , the scmf approach does not account for all correlations present in the nuclear ground state .",
    "partial correlations in a mean - field approach are often accounted for by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the ground state ( e.g. , the breaking of rotational symmetry by a deformed ground state )  @xcite .",
    "additional correlations beyond the mean - field approximation are included by restoration of this broken symmetry ( e.g. , by angular momentum projection )  @xcite , and by configuration mixing of symmetry - projected states via the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite .",
    "the gcm is also useful in providing information on excited states of the nucleus .",
    "angular - momentum and particle - number projected gcm has been applied successfully in global studies of binding energies  @xcite and of spectroscopic properties of the first excited @xmath8 state  @xcite in even - even nuclei .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we initiated an approach that takes advantage of the global validity of the scmf method and the higher accuracy of the cism approach .",
    "it is based on the idea of mapping an scmf theory onto an effective cism hamiltonian that is defined in a suitably chosen truncated model space .",
    "such an approach would enable us to start from an scmf theory with a global parametrization and construct effective cism hamiltonians in different mass regions . in heavy nuclei ,",
    "the required truncated shell model spaces are expected to be too large for conventional diagonalization of the cism hamiltonian . in such cases",
    ", one can apply methods that have been developed to treat very large model spaces , such as the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite , the monte carlo shell model  @xcite approach , and direct matrix methods  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use tractable approximations that go beyond the mean - field approximation such as the rpa  @xcite .    a mean - field approximation , based on a skyrme force ,",
    "was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the single - particle energies of a cism hamiltonian . in ref .",
    "we carried out the first step of mapping an scmf theory onto the cism and constructed an effective hamiltonian that includes quadrupolar correlations .",
    "the map was tested successfully in @xmath0 @xmath1-shell nuclei , using the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation of the so - called usd hamiltonian  @xcite as our starting point for an scmf theory .",
    "the usd hamiltonian was constructed empirically and is known to give a good description of the low - energy spectroscopy of @xmath1-shell nuclei . using the mapped cism hamiltonian , we found that quadrupolar correlations alone account for more than 50% of the full correlation energies contained in the usd hamiltonian .",
    "we then applied our mapping procedure to study quadrupolar correlations in @xmath0 @xmath1-shell nuclei starting from the sly4 parametrization of the skyrme energy functional as the scmf theory  @xcite .    here",
    "we explore the scmf to cism mapping idea further by including pairing correlations in the mapped effective cism hamiltonian in addition to quadrupolar correlations .",
    "the starting point is an scmf theory that includes pairing correlations .",
    "such a theory can be solved in the hf plus bcs approximation [ or more generally in the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) approach ] to provide the ground - state single - particle hf wave functions and energies , as well as the bcs occupation amplitudes .",
    "a similar hf+bcs approximation can be used to determine a spherical single - particle basis .",
    "this mean - field output is used to construct an effective cism hamiltonian in a truncated spherical model space that contains both quadrupolar and monopole pairing correlations . after testing the method using the hf+bcs approximation of the usd interaction as our initial scmf theory ,",
    "we apply it to deformed @xmath0 @xmath1-shell nuclei in the context of dft .",
    "the latter is based on the sly4 parameterization of the skyrme force in the particle - hole channel  @xcite plus a zero - range density - dependent force in the pairing channel  @xcite .",
    "it is solved in the hf+bcs approximation using the brussels - paris computer code ev8  @xcite .",
    "the mapping constructed here could also be useful in global studies of level densities within the smmc approach  @xcite .",
    "both quadrupolar and pairing correlations play an important role in the microscopic calculations of level densities .    pairing correlations are natural for spherical nuclei . here , however , we consider the addition of pairing correlations on top of quadrupolar correlations in the cism hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore focus on nuclei whose hf+bcs ground state is deformed . in principle , the method presented here can be extended to spherical nuclei by applying an external quadrupole field , thus effectively deforming the nucleus .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we discuss our mapping procedure when pairing correlations are included in the scmf theory .",
    "the ground state is solved in the hf+bcs approximation and its unique description requires both a density matrix and a pairing tensor ( or an anomalous density matrix ) .",
    "the cism hamiltonian is constructed in a truncated spherical space to include both quadrupolar and pairing correlations . in sec .",

    "[ map - dft ] we map a dft that is based on the sly4 skyrme interaction plus a zero - range density - dependent pairing force onto an effective cism hamiltonian for deformed @xmath0 @xmath1 shell nuclei .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the theoretical framework of mapping an scmf theory into a cism theory in the case where the scmf includes pairing correlations .",
    "we assume that the scmf theory is solved in the hf+bcs approximation  @xcite .",
    "this is for example the case of skyrme - type density functional theories in which pairing correlations are considered through the addition of a zero - range density - dependent force in the pairing channel  @xcite .",
    "the hf+bcs mean - field theory provides us with a set of single - particle hf orbitals @xmath9 and their corresponding single - particle energies @xmath10 and bcs occupation amplitudes @xmath11 , as well as the total energy @xmath12 of the hf+bcs ground state . for simplicity",
    "we assume that this solution , obtained as the global minimum of an energy density functional , is deformed . using the same scmf theory",
    "( i.e. , hf+bcs ) we can also find the spherical solution .",
    "our plan is to use this output of the scmf theory to construct an effective cism hamiltonian that is defined within a truncated shell model space . in particular",
    ", we will consider an cism hamiltonian that contains a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction and a monopole pairing interaction .",
    "the cism is defined in a spherical basis , and we determine such a basis from the spherical solution of the scmf theory .",
    "a spherical solution could be found by iterations when the initial guess for the density matrix is chosen to be spherically symmetric , and as long as the spherical symmetry is preserved in the iteration procedure . in ref .",
    "we used the hf approximation , in which case it was necessary ( for an open shell nucleus ) to use the uniform filling approximation or add a pairing - like interaction with a fixed gap to preserve spherical symmetry in the next iteration . here",
    ", the bcs approximation guarantees that the density matrix in the next iteration remains spherical .",
    "the construction of a standard spherical basis with good angular momentum @xmath13 and projection @xmath14 was discussed in sec .",
    "iv of ref .  .",
    "here we use @xmath15 as a generic label for the spherical basis , i.e. , @xmath15 includes the quantum numbers @xmath16 as well as other quantum numbers . to denote spherical states and lowercase roman letters @xmath17 to denote deformed states . ]    the transformation matrix between the deformed single - particle basis @xmath18 and the spherical single - particle basis @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the creation operator in a spherical state @xmath15 and @xmath22 is the creation operator in a deformed state @xmath18 .",
    "the deformed ground state in the hf approximation is a slater determinant @xmath23 which is uniquely described by a density matrix @xmath24 .",
    "however , in the hf+bcs approximation , the ground state @xmath25 is defined by the bcs amplitudes @xmath26 ( the product runs over half the number of single - particle states @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the state conjugate to @xmath18 ) .",

    ", the trace of @xmath24 must be equal to the total number of particles @xmath39 of a given type ( protons or neutrons ) @xmath40 in the framework of the hf+bcs approximation , this condition is satisfied by using a suitable chemical potential @xmath41 ( for each type of particle ) .    in the hf approximation , the ground state is a slater determinant and the corresponding density matrix must be a projector @xmath42 with all eigenvalues either 1 or 0 .",
    "however , in the hf+bcs ground state the matrix @xmath24 is no longer a projector and its eigenvalues @xmath43 are between 0 and 1 .",
    "the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath29 , which characterize uniquely the hf+bcs ground state , satisfy now the relations    [ new - conditions ] @xmath44    in the following , we assume that the scmf theory has time - reversal symmetry so that the single - particle orbitals come in degenerate time - reversed pairs @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the time - reversal operator ) . in the following we choose the @xmath48 orbitals to be the orbitals with positive @xmath49-signature  @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath50 with @xmath48 spans the complete single - particle space .",
    "we also assume that the ground state solution is axially symmetric , in which case @xmath51 is a good quantum number ( @xmath49 is the symmetry axis ) , and the positive @xmath49-signature orbitals have @xmath52 . similarly , the spherical states appear in degenerate time - reversed pairs @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the positive @xmath49-signature states .    the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath29 have the following simple form in the deformed hf basis ( for @xmath55 )    [ hf - basis ] @xmath56    the transformation matrix @xmath57 is real ( and thus orthogonal ) and the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath29 remain real in the spherical basis .",
    "since the spherical states also have good @xmath49-signature , the transformation @xmath57 does not mix states with different @xmath49-signature and for @xmath58 we have @xmath59 . applying the time - reversal operator to this relation and using the fact that @xmath57 is real , we find that the time - reversed states transform in exactly the same way @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath61 it follows that the density and anomalous density matrices have the block form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are real matrices whose dimension is half the total number of orbitals .",
    "it follows from eqs .",

    "the form ( [ block - form ] ) is equivalent to    [ spherical - basis ] @xmath67    it is convenient to define the density and anomalous density _ operators _ by    [ operator - form ] @xmath68    such that their matrix representation in the corresponding basis gives us the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ". equations ( [ a - b ] ) and ( [ spherical - basis ] ) follow then immediately from the operator form ( [ operator - form ] ) .    the basic relations ( [ new - conditions ] ) defining an hf+bcs state can be rewritten in terms of the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 as    [ a - b - conditions ] @xmath71    a more compact way of representing the relations ( [ new - conditions ] ) or ( [ a - b - conditions ] ) is to introduce a generalized density matrix @xmath72 whose dimension is twice the total number of orbitals  @xcite    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the identity matrix in a space whose dimension is half the number of orbitals . relations ( [ new - conditions ] ) or ( [ a - b - conditions ] ) are equivalent to the condition that @xmath72 is a projector @xmath75 thus the eigenvalues of @xmath72 must be 1 or 0 . this condition is formally similar to the one satisfied by @xmath24 in the hf approximation except that there are now twice as many eigenvalues . in our case ,",
    "the matrix @xmath72 is real symmetric and its eigenvalues are pairwise degenerate .",
    "as long as the spherical basis @xmath15 is complete , * u * is unitary and we have just generated a different representation of the same ground - state density matrix and pairing tensor .",
    "however , in constructing a shell model space , it is necessary to truncate to a valence subspace .",
    "we define such a subspace in terms of a projector @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes a sum over a subset of the single - particle orbitals @xmath15 . the density operator @xmath78 and anomalous density operator @xmath79 are then replaced by projected densities @xmath80 the corresponding matrices in the truncated spherical space are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    in choosing a suitable truncated subspace , we require the projected densities to preserve approximately their basic properties in the complete space . in the hf+bcs approximation ,",
    "the trace of the density matrix is constraint to give the total number of particles [ see eq .",
    "( [ trace - rho ] ) ] , and we require that a similar relation is satisfied approximately by the projected density @xmath83 with the number of particles replaced by the valence number of particles @xmath84 another requirement is that the conditions ( [ new - conditions ] ) are satisfied approximately by the projected densities @xmath85 and @xmath86 . alternatively , we require the matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 to approximately satisfy ( [ a - b - conditions ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to define the projected @xmath72 matrix @xmath89 and require that it satisfies approximately the condition ( [ r - proj_first ] ) , namely that its eigenvalues are close to either 1 or 0 .",
    "formally , this condition is similar to the one we require from the projected density matrix @xmath24 at the hf level  @xcite , except that the projected @xmath72 matrix is defined in twice the number of dimensions .    in general , we can calculate the expectation value of a one - body observable @xmath90 in the truncated cism space using the projected density @xmath91 where the sum is restricted to the truncated spherical space .",
    "the ratio between the expectation value of @xmath92 in the full and truncated spaces provides us with simple rescaling factors of one - body operators in the truncated cism space .      in this section",
    "we construct the cism hamiltonian given the hf+bcs ground - state solution .",

    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 are , respectively , quadrupole and pairing coupling constants . in comparison with the cism effective hamiltonian considered in ref .  , eq .  ( [ effective - h ] ) contains an additional monopole pairing interaction .",
    "we note that one might consider an isovector monopole pairing ( which contains also a proton - neutron component ) .",
    "however , in the dft applications we discuss in sec .",
    "[ map - dft ] , the resulting hf hamiltonian does not conserve isospin symmetry ( because of the coulomb interaction ) and we only consider here an hamiltonian of the form ( [ effective - h ] ) .",
    "we found that an isospin - invariant interaction constructed from an isovector monopole pair operator gives only a small correction to the correlation energy when compared with a hamiltonian of the form ( [ effective - h ] ) . ]",
    "both quadrupole - quadrupole and pairing interactions in ( [ effective - h ] ) are attractive ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) , leading to an cism hamiltonian that has a good monte carlo sign in the smmc approach  @xcite .",
    "the method outlined above determines the effective hamiltonian ( [ effective - h ] ) up to the two coupling constants @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in ref .",
    "we determine the coupling constant of the quadrupolar interaction by matching the deformation energy of the scmf theory with the deformation energy of the cism effective hamiltonian when the latter is solved in the hf approximation .",
    "when the effective hamiltonian has the form ( [ effective - h ] ) , it is necessary to match two energy scales in order to determine the two coupling constants @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "one energy scale is the deformation energy , here redefined in the hf+bcs approximation @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the energy of the spherical hf+bcs solution and @xmath12 is the hf+bcs energy of the deformed ground - state solution .",
    "the deformation energy in ( [ deformation - energy ] ) is usually smaller than the deformation energy calculated in the hf approximation .    to introduce a second energy scale ,",
    "we define @xmath115 to be the average interaction in the pairing channel @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the pairing gap matrix . , where @xmath118 is the anti - symmetrized two - body interaction . ]",
    "the energy @xmath115 can be calculated in both the spherical and deformed solutions and we define the pairing energy excess to be @xmath119 since @xmath115 is lower ( i.e. , more negative ) in the spherical solution , the energy difference in ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) is usually positive .",
    "the two coupling parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 are determined by matching simultaneously the two energy scales ( [ deformation - energy ] ) and ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) between the scmf theory and the cism hamiltonian when the cism is treated in the hf+bcs approximation .",
    "in general , the coupling parameters should be renormalized depending on the truncation used for the cism space .",
    "these renormalization effects are included implicitly in our procedure by matching the energy scales calculated in the scmf approach in the complete space with similar energy scales calculated in the truncated cism space within the hf+bcs approximation .",
    "an important application of our mapping is in the calculation of correlation energies .",
    "the correlation energy @xmath120 is defined as the difference between the ground - state energy in the hf+bcs approximation to the cism hamiltonian and the fully correlated ground - state energy @xmath121 of the cism @xmath122    quadrupolar and pairing correlations compete with each other ; the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction favors deformation in which pairing is suppressed , while pairing favors the spherical configuration .",
    "if we consider the spherical configuration alone , then the bcs approximation already takes into account some of the gain in pairing correlation energy .",
    "however , in the deformed nuclei considered here we effectively gain more in mean - field energy by deformation . in the deformed ground state ,",
    "bcs correlations are often significantly smaller than in the spherical solution ( or even vanish ) .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation energy described by ( [ e - corr ] ) is expected to increase when a pairing term is added to the quadrupolar cism hamiltonian .",
    "this increase arises from fluctuations of the pairing fields beyond the bcs approximation .",
    "in particular , these fluctuations sample the spherical configuration in which pairing correlations are significant .",
    "even in spherical nuclei ( which we do not treat here ) we expect to gain a finite correlation energy in ( [ e - corr ] ) when adding a pairing term to the cism hamiltonian , i.e. , there are pairing correlations beyond those described by the spherical bcs solution .",
    "the bcs approximation is valid in the limit when the pairing gap is much larger than the mean single - particle level spacing , and studies of pairing effects in ultra - small metallic grains revealed deviations from bcs theory in the crossover to the fluctuation - dominated regime  @xcite .",
    "nuclei belong to this crossover regime , in which the pairing gap is comparable to the mean - level spacing  @xcite .    in the remaining part of this section",
    "we further motivate our choice of the second energy scale ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) .",
    "as already noted , pairing effects are weaker in a deformed configuration and could vanish altogether ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) in the deformed ground state .",
    "for example , in our hf+bcs studies of the usd interaction in sec .",
    "[ map - usd ] , we observe such a collapse of the bcs solution in all three deformed @xmath0 @xmath1-shell nuclei .",
    "we then have @xmath124 , and only the spherical solution is relevant for determining the second energy scale .",
    "an alternative second energy scale that could be used in such cases is @xmath125 , the decrease in spherical energy in the hf+bcs approximation as compared with the hf approximation . in general @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the spherical one - body density and",
    "@xmath118 is the anti - symmetrized two - body interaction .",
    "the gain in pairing energy from @xmath128 is thus canceled in part by the increase @xmath129 of the one - body energy and the increase @xmath130 of the average interaction in the particle - hole channel . despite this partial cancelation , @xmath131 remains well correlated with @xmath125 and , as long as the deformed solution is unpaired , we find that both energy scales ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) and ( [ spherical - pairing ] ) lead to cism hamiltonians with similar coupling constants",
    ".    however , the deformed ground state can generally have a non - vanishing ( though weaker ) pairing solution , as we observe in our dft studies of sec .",
    "[ scmf - results ] . in such cases ,",
    "we find that matching the energy scale ( [ spherical - pairing ] ) results in a correlation energy ( [ e - corr ] ) of the cism ground state that is unphysically large .",
    "we therefore adopt ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) as the second energy scale to be matched when the deformed solution is paired .",
    "the scale ( [ delta - e - pair ] ) also has the obvious advantage that it is defined within a single scmf theory ( i.e. , hf+bcs ) and does not require the use of two different mean - field theories ( i.e. , hf and hf+bcs ) .",
    "in this section we test the mapping procedure discussed in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] by considering the hf+bcs solution of the usd hamiltonian  @xcite as our starting point of an scmf theory .",
    "the usd interaction provides a rather good description of binding energies , spectra and electromagnetic transition intensities of @xmath1-shell nuclei  @xcite . in these studies",
    "we compare the correlation energies found from the mapped cism hamiltonian with the full correlation energies of the usd hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ map - dft ] , we apply the mapping formalism to a dft that is defined by an sly4 skyrme force  @xcite in the particle - hole channel plus a zero - range density - dependent force in the pairing channel  @xcite .    here and in sec .  [ map - dft ]",
    "we focus on @xmath0 nuclei , in which isovector quadruple - quadrupole correlations could be ignored .",

    "the correlation energy of @xmath160 mev we find for @xmath2ne ( using a somewhat reduced value of @xmath154 ) is also consistent with the value of 3.1 mev reported in ref .  .",
    "in this work we have mapped an scmf theory onto an effective cism hamiltonian in the presence of both quadrupolar and pairing correlations . when compared with ref .",
    ", this is an important step forward in constructing a general map that would take advantage of the global validity of the energy density functional and the higher accuracy of the cism approach .",
    "the main differences compared with the study initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite are : ( i ) the scmf is now based on an hf+bcs approximation ( rather than hf ) , and the ground - state consistency conditions are recast in terms of both the density matrix and the pairing tensor .",
    "( ii ) the effective hamiltonian depends now on two coupling strengths , and consequently two energy scales must be matched to determine these coupling parameters .",
    "one energy scale is the deformation energy , similar to the one used previously but now redefined in terms of the hf+bcs energies .",
    "the second scale is determined by the difference of average pairing energy in the deformed ground state and spherical configurations .",
    "the new map constructed here provides improved correlation energies that are consistent with other methods that include quadrupolar and pairing correlations beyond the mean field .",
    "the dft application discussed here is based on a skyrme force in the particle - hole channel plus a zero - range density - dependent interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "one could alternatively start from a mean - field calculation with a finite - range gogny force .",
    "such an interaction includes pairing correlations consistently and is usually treated in the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) method .",
    "the map constructed here can be easily generalized to the gogny dft by replacing the hf+bcs approximation by the hfb approximation , both when solving the dft and in the mean - field solution of the cism hamiltonian .    as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite much remains to be done .",
    "nuclei that have no spherical pairing solution can be treated by introducing a constraining pairing field .",
    "the addition of an interaction term built from an isovector quadrupole operator would enable us to generalize our studies to @xmath161 nuclei and carry out systematic studies .",
    "a major challenge is the application to the heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "although the method presented here can in principle be adapted to such nuclei , outstanding issues are the ability of a spherical shell model to describe nuclei with large deformation in a truncated space and the practical issue of solving the cism hamiltonian in large model spaces .",
