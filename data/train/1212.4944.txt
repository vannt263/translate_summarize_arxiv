    "as time goes by , our confidence in what we are doing seems to be dwindling - so to look for `` superstring '' , etc .",
    ", as alternatives . nevertheless , the language which was built up during the last century , namely , renormalizable quantum field theory , may still be the language underlying the final standard model",
    ". it will be the language of this paper .    usually in a textbook",
    ", the qcd chapter precedes the one on glashow - weinberg - salam ( gws ) electroweak theory .",
    "nothing is wrong with it but the basic units ( or the building blocks ) are further divided into the left - handed and right - handed components",
    ". it would be nice ( in helping us in thinking ) if the framework is formulated all at once - in an extended standard model we could see everything consistent with one another .",
    "then , the questions which we pose could have broader meanings and implications . thus , this is what we wish to do .    we shall work with the lie group @xmath4 as the gauge group .",
    "thus , the basic units are made up from quarks ( of six flavors , of three colors , and of the two helicities ) and leptons ( of three generations and of the two helicities ) , together with all originally massless gauge bosons and the somewhat hidden induced higgs fields . in view of the search over the last forty years , we could assume `` minimum higgs hypothesis '' as the working rule .    if we look at the basic units as compared to the original particle , i.e. the electron , the starting basic units are all `` point - like '' dirac particles .",
    "dirac invented dirac electrons eighty years ago and surprisingly enough these `` point - like '' dirac particles are the basic units of the standard model .",
    "thus , we call it `` dirac similarity principle '' - a salute to dirac ; a triumph to mathematics .",
    "our world could indeed be described by the proper mathematics .",
    "the proper mathematics may be the renormalizable quantum field theory , although our confidence in it sort of fluctuates in time .",
    "there is no way to `` prove '' the above two working rules - `` dirac similarity principle '' and `` minimum higgs hypothesis '' .",
    "it might be associated with the peculiar property of our lorentz - invariant space - time . to use these two working rules ,",
    "we could simplify tremendously the searches for the new extended standard models .",
    "so far , we have decided on the basic units - those left - handed and right - handed quarks and leptons ; the gauge group is chosen to be @xmath0 .    in the gauge sector , the lagrangian is fixed if the gauge group is given ; only for a massive gauge theory , higgs fields are called for and we postpone its discussions until we have spelled out the fermion sector .    for the fermion sector , the story is again fixed if the so - called `` gauge - invariant derivative '' , i.e. @xmath5 in the kinetic - energy term @xmath6 , is given for a given basic unit @xcite .    thus , we have , for the up - type right - handed quarks @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and , for the rotated down - type right - handed quarks @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14    on the other hand , we have , for the @xmath15 quark doublets , @xmath16    for the lepton side , we introduce the family triplet , @xmath17 ( column ) , under @xmath18 .",
    "since the minimal standard model does not see the right - handed neutrinos , it would be a natural way to make an extension of the minimal standard model .",
    "we propose that neutrinos are only species seeing the family gauge sector . or , we have , for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 and , for the left - handed @xmath18-triplet and @xmath15-doublet @xmath22 ( all columns ) ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 if the right - handed charged leptons were singlets under @xmath18 , then the mass - generation terms for charged leptons would involve the cross terms , such as @xmath25 , which is not acceptable at all .",
    "thus , the right - handed charged leptons have to form another triplet @xmath26 under @xmath18 .    in other words ,",
    "the quark masses are given by the higgs mechanism in the minimal standard model while the masses of charged leptons are determined by @xmath27 , only a universal number in the leading - order sense .",
    "to make a reasonable theory @xcite , we have to make certain that all gauge bosons and the residual family higgs particles are very massive , i.e. @xmath28 a few tev .    as slightly differing from the previous effort @xcite , we would like to write down the @xmath29 standard model _ all at once_. we introduce the neutrino mass term as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the lepton multiplets just mentioned above ( with the first number for @xmath18 and the second for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the cross ( curl ) product is somewhat new @xcite , referring to the singlet combination of three triplets in @xmath32 - an @xmath32 operation ( and not a matrix product ) .",
    "the higgs field @xmath33 is new in this effort , because it carries some nontrivial @xmath15 charge .",
    "neutrinos have masses , the tiny masses far below the range of the masses of the quarks and charged leptons .",
    "neutrinos oscillate among themselves , giving rise to a lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "there are other oscillation stories , such as the oscillation in the @xmath34 system , but there is a fundamental difference here - the @xmath34 system is composite while neutrinos are `` point - like '' dirac particles .",
    "it is true that neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations may be regarded as one of the most important experimental facts over the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "in fact , certain lfv processes such as @xmath35 @xcite and @xmath36 are closely related to the most cited picture of neutrino oscillations so far @xcite . in recent publications by one @xcite of us , it was pointed out that the cross - generation or off - diagonal neutrino - higgs interaction may serve as the detailed mechanism of neutrino oscillations , with some vacuum expectation value of the new higgs field(s ) .    in the other words ,",
    "the first term in the last equation [ eq . ( 6 ) ] can be used as the basis to analyze the various lepton - flavor - violating decays and reactions .    to illustrate the point further , we calculate the golden lepton - flavor - violating decay @xmath35 as the celebrated example .",
    "we show in figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) , and 1(c ) three leading basic feynman diagrams . here",
    "the conversion of @xmath37 into @xmath38 is marked by a cross sign and it is a term from the off - diagonal interaction given above with the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath39 . here",
    "the higgs masses are assumed to be very large , i.e. , greater than a few @xmath40 , as in @xmath18 .",
    "the only small number ( coupling ) is @xmath41 , consistent with the tiny masses of neutrinos .",
    ".,width=384 ]    using feynman rules from wu and hwang @xcite , we write , for fig .",
    "1(a ) ,    @xmath42    with @xmath43 .    on the other hand ,",
    "feynman rules yield , for fig .",
    "1(b ) , @xmath44 and a similar result for fig .",
    "the four - dimensional integrations can be carried out , via the dimensional integration formulae ( e.g. ch .",
    "10 , wu / hwang @xcite ) , especially if we drop the small masses compared to the w - boson mass @xmath45 in the denominator . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath46    it is interesting to note that the wave - function renormalization , as shown by figs . 1(b ) and 1(c ) , yields @xmath47 noting that @xmath48 and @xmath49 would make the contribution from figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) to be of the opposite sign to that from fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the leading terms all cancel , a result of gauge invariance .",
    "we have computed some next - order terms but a complete result seems to be rather difficult to obtain .    in a normal treatment",
    ", one ignores the wave - function renormalization diagrams 1(b ) and 1(c ) in the treatment of the decays @xmath35 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .    comparing this to the dominant mode @xmath52 @xcite",
    ", we could obtain the branching ratio . even though the decay rate for @xmath53 would be of the order @xmath54 , which is extremely small .",
    "note that the cancelation does not exist for @xmath55 , nor for the conversion process",
    "so , the rates would be expected to be much larger .",
    "the off - diagonal mass matrix would be modified by the self - energy diagram since the neutrinos form a triplet under @xmath18 .",
    "it is presumed that these self - energy diagrams , after the ultraviolet divergences get subtracted , lead to masses of the right order .",
    "if the off - diagonal mass matrix is diagonalized alone , the three roots would be two negative and one positive , adding up to zero .",
    "this seems like one ordering in the masses of neutrinos - one up and two downs .    besides the golden decay @xmath53 ( much too small ) and neutrino oscillations ( already observed ) , violation of the @xmath57 universality",
    "is also expected and might be observed . as the baryon asymmetry is sometime attributed to the lepton - antilepton asymmetry , the current scenario for neutrino oscillations @xcite seems to be inadequate .",
    "if we take the hints from neutrinos rather seriously , there are so much to discover , even though the minimal standard model for the ordinary - matter world remains to be pretty much intact .",
    "let us come back to look at the statement of the extended standard model .",
    "we choose the basic units at first and then the gauge group .",
    "the higgs mechanism would be in the last step .",
    "if that is the case , we have some difficulty in writing down the left - right model @xcite .",
    "if we need to assign a certain left - handed or right - handed spinor into two basic units simultaneously , then the kinetic term appears twice - our language does not go ; we believe that a lagrangian should have only one kinetic term .",
    "so , our first question would be : could the above rationale rule out the right - handed sector , since the simultaneous presence of the left - handed and right - handed basic units as @xmath58 doublets are excluded ? experimentally , we should check this point .",
    "as long as we could argue , we note that , as long as the left - handed and right - handed components are split in the basic units , parity has to be violated , either v - a or v+a .    in a slightly different context @xcite ,",
    "it was proposed that we could work with two working rules : `` dirac similarity principle '' , based on eighty years of experience , and `` minimum higgs hypothesis '' , from the last forty years of experience .",
    "using these two working rules , the extended model mentioned above becomes rather unique - so , it is so much easier to check it against the experiments .",
    "the model stated in the paper is yet to be completed , in view of the `` minimum higgs hypothesis '' .",
    "the higgs mechanism in the previous @xmath18 family gauge theory is complete since the theory is treated _",
    "alone_. with @xmath18 and @xmath15 ( 3 , 2 ) higgs multiplet mentioned above plus one ( 3 , 1 ) higgs triplet , is it sufficient to do the higgs - mechanism job - no `` unwanted '' massless particles ?",
    "we would like to list this `` mathematical '' question as the second important question .",
    "we would be curious about how the dark - matter world looks like , though it is difficult to verify experimentally",
    ". the first question would be : the dark - matter world , 25 % of the current universe ( in comparison , only 5 % in the ordinary matter ) , would clusterize to form the dark - matter galaxies , maybe even before the ordinary - matter galaxies .",
    "the dark - matter galaxies would then play the hosts of ( visible ) ordinary - matter galaxies , like our own galaxy , the milky way .",
    "note that a dark - matter galaxy is by our definition a galaxy that does not possess any ordinary strong and electromagnetic interactions ( with our visible ordinary - matter world ) .",
    "this fundamental question deserves some thoughts , for the structural formation of our universe .",
    "of course , we should remind ourselves that , in our ordinary - matter world , those quarks can aggregate in no time , to hadrons , including nuclei , and the electrons serve to neutralize the charges also in no time",
    ". then atoms , molecules , complex molecules , and so on .",
    "these serve as the seeds for the clusters , and then stars , and then galaxies , maybe in a time span of @xmath59 ( i.e. , the age of our young universe ) .",
    "the aggregation caused by strong and electromagnetic forces is fast enough to help giving rise to galaxies in a time span of @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", the seeded clusterings might proceed with abundance of extra - heavy dark - matter particles such as familons and family higgs , all greater than a few @xmath40 and with relatively long lifetimes ( owing to very limited decay channels ) .",
    "so , further simulations on galactic formation and evolution may yield clues on our problem .      finally , coming back to the fronts of particle physics , neutrinos , especially the right - handed neutrinos , might couple to the dark - matter particles .",
    "any further investigation along this direction would be of utmost importance .",
    "it may shed light on the nature of the dark - matter world .",
    "the minimum higgs picture is as follows : the standard - model higgs doublet @xmath60 , the purely family higgs triplet @xmath61 , and the mixed family higgs @xmath33 . the triplet @xmath61 and the neutral part @xmath62 undergoes the spontaneous symmetry breaking as in @xcite . in the u - gauge ,",
    "the neutral part @xmath63 gets projected out and the mass term becomes negative while there remains to have no ssb in the charged part @xmath64 . for details , please consult @xcite .",
