    "although nonlinearity is an ubiquitous and fascinating feature of real - world dynamical phenomena , some aspects of such a fundamental property remain poorly explored , partly because they are rarely incorporated into the mathematical models which aim to describe even the simplest of such phenomena . in the context of nonautonomous systems ,",
    "one of these aspects is the nature of the periodic excitations which can act on a given nonlinear , dissipative or hamiltonian , system .",
    "since nonlinear systems represent the general case , it would be natural to model periodic excitations ( external or parametric ) by using periodic functions that are solutions of ( physically relevant ) nonlinear equations , instead of harmonic functions which are solutions of linear systems , even though the latter have been overwhelmingly used up to now . to consider nonlinear periodic excitations implies enlarging the amplitude - period parameter space to include the parameters , @xmath0 , that control the excitation shape .",
    "note that , in the general case , these parameters @xmath0 are the ( normalized ) fourier coefficients of the periodic function . in physical terms this means that , for a fixed amplitude and period , the parameters @xmath0 are responsible for the temporal rate at which energy is transferred from the excitation mechanism to the system . in the context of systems described by ordinary differential equations , this idea has led to the demonstration of the existence of new generic _ temporal _ chaos@xmath1order routes by changing only the shape of a nonlinear periodic excitation [ 1 - 3 ] .    in this present work",
    ", the onset of _ spatio - temporal _ chaos associated with the competition between sine - gordon - breathers and kink - antikink - pairs is investigated in a one - dimensional sine - gordon ( sg ) system @xmath2 ,   \\eqnum{1}\\]]when _ only _ the excitation shape is varied . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the jacobian elliptic function ( jef ) of parameter @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ) used _ solely _ as an example to illustrate the reshaping - induced order - chaos route . when @xmath6 , then @xmath7 = \\sin ( 2\\pi t / t)$ ] , i.e. , one recovers the previously studied case of harmonic excitation [ 4 ] .",
    "this is relevant in comparing the structural stability of the sg system when solely the excitation shape is varied . in the other limit , @xmath8 ,",
    "one obtains the fourier expansion of the square wave function : @xmath9 = \\left ( 4/\\pi \\right ) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } \\left ( 2n+1\\right ) ^{-1}\\sin \\left [ \\left ( 2n+1\\right ) 2\\pi t / t\\right ] $ ] . from an experimental standpoint",
    ", the choice of the above jef is motivated for the fact that only the excitation shape is varied by increasing @xmath4 from 0 to 1 , and there is thus a smooth transition from a sine function to a square wave .",
    "while these two limiting shapes are readily implemented in experiments , no theoretical analysis connecting them has been developed up to now in the context of sg systems .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , a collective coordinate approach [ 4 ]",
    "is used to obtain an effective equation of motion for the collective variables . in section 3 , melnikov s method",
    "is applied to the resulting effective equation of motion to estimate the parameter - space regions of the elliptic ac force where the onset of chaotic instabilities is expected .",
    "numerical evidence supporting the theoretical predictions from previous sections is presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 includes a summary of the findings .",
    "in this present work , a single - breather excitation is assumed to be present in the absence of dissipation and forcing ( @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that the simultaneous action of dissipative @xmath11 and spatially uniform harmonic forces @xmath12 can break the breather into a kink - antikink pair , which can then recombine into a breather soliton [ 4,5 ] . for fixed dissipation , this process may occur repeatedly yielding an intermittent chaotic sequence for certain values of amplitude and period .",
    "the above elliptic ac driving permits one to study such a competition between the breather and the kink - antikink pair for parameter values belonging to _ larger _ regions of the amplitude - period parameter space . to this end",
    ", one makes a severe mode truncation to the breather collective coordinates [ 6,7 ] , which yields a set of ordinary differential equations capable of being studied with the aid of melnikov s method [ 8,9 ] .",
    "such an effective equation exhibits a separatrix dynamics which is equivalent to the separatrix dynamics of the full sine - gordon equation .",
    "in particular , homoclinic bifurcations correspond to ( chaotic ) intermittent binding and unbinding of the kink - antikink pair . in order to determine the equations of motion for the breather collective modes ,",
    "one first needs the breather and kink - antikink solutions to the unperturbed sine - gordon equation ( @xmath13 in eq .",

    "this two - breather state has thus a spatial period @xmath70 and a temporal period 1 , and exhibits mirror symmetry with respect to the origin .",
    "the spatial symmetry is broken as the forcing shape deviates from sinusoidal .",
    "figure3 illustrates this phenomenon with the values @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this spatial symmetry breaking of the two - breather state appears to be an unavoidable precursor of the onset of spatio - temporal chaos via the kink - antikink collision mechanism , as can be appreciated in fig . 3 for the shape parameter @xmath73 , which corresponds to the theoretically predicted chaotic threshold ( cf .",
    "( 16 ) ) . for higher values of the shape parameter ,",
    "i.e. , when the driving shape is ever closer to a square wave , one finds the persistence of the chaotic dynamics ( cf . figs . 3 , @xmath74 ) predicted by the melnikov - method - based analysis",
    "in sum , it has been shown through the example of an elliptic ac driving that the competition between sine - gordon - breather and kink - antikink - pair solitons strongly depends on the shape of the spatially uniform ac driving .",
    "in particular , it was theoretically predicted and numerically confirmed that a square wave is more effective than a sinusoidal function to yield spatio - temporal chaos associated with the competition between sine - gordon - breathers and kink - antikink - pairs .",
    "potential application of the present results to reshaping - induced control ( suppression and enhancement ) of chaotic dynamics [ 1,14,15 ] range from dna molecules [ 16 ] to long josephson junctions and quasi - one - dimensional ferromagnets [ 17 ] .",
    "an interesting problem under current investigation is whether the above predictions on the chaotic threshold remain reliable in the so - called ( for @xmath6 ) nonlinear ( cubic ) schrdinger regime ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , where the chaotic dynamics is dominated by breather - breather transitions instead of the breather to kink - antikink transitions of the regime studied here ( @xmath68 ) , since both mechanisms involve homoclinic crossings [ 13 ] ."
