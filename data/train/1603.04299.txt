    "as discussed later on the @xmath125 and @xmath124 value can be slightly different for the two types of fronts .",

    "this diagram clearly shows that increasing either @xmath35 or @xmath51 , keeping the other constant , leads to the lack of frozen fronts .",
    "this can be easily at least qualitatively understood : increasing the flow velocity results in a frozen front closer to the disk for the upstream front and closer downstream branches for the downstream one . as a result",
    "the velocity increase promotes the front touching the disk from the left or the two downstream branches to merge .",
    "we observe the same effect by increasing @xmath24 . to be more quantitative , on the log - log plot of fig .",

    "[ eiksimul ] is the superposition of the iso - concentration map from the simulation and of the eikonal curve for @xmath138 and @xmath136 . even though for such a small @xmath24 we are already in the plateau [ selection ] of the full eikonal limit , there not a matching between the two",
    "of course we can not expect that the single concentration jump eikonal curve match with the @xmath139 iso - concentration of the simulation but the difference is surprising , especially far away from the solid disk where the velocity field is uniform @xmath140 .",

    "[ eiksimul ] : @xmath157 leading to @xmath158 is in agreement with eq .",
    "these observations deserve comments . even if the chemical length is very small compared to the disk size ( @xmath159 ) , we are not in the full eikonal regime @xmath94 as already observed @xcite .",
    "the extension of the front , @xmath160 still matters ; in this uniform flow region , the iso - concentrations adapt their spreading as well as their orientation to fulfill the convection reaction balance , the eikonal curve having only the orientation freedom .",
    "the experiments with the dipole design has proved the relevance of the eikonal to account for the shape of frozen fronts around an immaterial obstacle",
    ". the problem would not be so easy for a front originating from the solid surface . in the eikonal limit the front can not be static : at the solid surface the flow velocity vanishes @xmath161 and unless the curvature at the surface is of the order of @xmath24 , the only possibility left from eq .",
