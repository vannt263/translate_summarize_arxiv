    "<S> recent results from the cogent collaboration ( as well as the annual modulation reported by dama / libra ) point toward dark matter with a light ( @xmath0 ) mass and a relatively large elastic scattering cross section with nucleons ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) . in order to possess this cross section , </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter must communicate with the standard model through mediating particles with small masses and/or large couplings . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore with a model independent approach the particle physics scenarios that could potentially accommodate these signals . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how such models could produce the gamma rays from the galactic center observed in the data of the fermi gamma ray space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find multiple particle physics scenarios in which each of these signals can be accounted for , and in which the dark matter can be produced thermally in the early universe with an abundance equal to the measured cosmological density .    the cogent collaboration has recently reported an excess of low energy events that are not consistent with known backgrounds  @xcite . if interpreted as a signal of elastically scattering dark matter , this would imply a relatively light ( 510  @xmath3 ) mass for the dark matter ( dm ) , and a somewhat large cross section with nucleons  approximately ( 12 ) @xmath4@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this range of mass and scattering cross section is compatible with a dm explanation of the annual modulation reported by the dama / libra collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although null results from xenon10  @xcite and cdms - ii  @xcite place significant constraints on this interpretation , a region of parameter space remains open  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if cogent is in fact observing elastically scattering dm , then their rate is predicted to vary with an observable degree of annual modulation ( @xmath510% ) , providing a means with which to confirm or refute a dm interpretation of this signal in the coming months  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a recent analysis of the first two years of data from the fermi gamma ray space telescope has revealed a flux of gamma rays concentrated around the inner @xmath5@xmath6 of the milky way , with a spectrum that is sharply peaked at 2 - 4 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if interpreted as the products of dm annihilation , this signal implies that the dm particle ( which we will call @xmath7 ) has a mass between @xmath8 gev , similar to the cogent and dama / libra value .    following previous work  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we study the particle physics implications of these signals . working with perturbative uv completions , </S>",
    "<S> we explore the set of simple theories capable of explaining the observed signals , assuming that the cogent / dama signals arise from the elastic scattering of a particle that is the majority of our universe s dm and whose annihilations produce the fermi gamma ray signal . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by examining an inclusive list of mechanisms which could mediate the dm - nucleon interaction , then turning to the galactic center gamma ray signal and dm relic abundance . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that the bulk of the space of simple uv completions are likely to result in visible signals at colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> the elastic scattering of a dm particle with nuclei can be written as a combination of spin - independent and spin - dependent couplings , and may or may not be be velocity - suppressed . to generate the signals observed by both cogent and dama / libra </S>",
    "<S> , we must invoke spin - independent couplings , as the germanium used by cogent contains a small quantity of isotopes with net spin , and velocity - independent scattering because dm in the halo typically has small ( @xmath9 ) velocity . </S>",
    "<S> significant interactions of this type may result from scalar combinations of quarks @xmath10 or gluons @xmath11 , a vector bilinear of quarks @xmath12 , or a tensor bilinear @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume there are no new sources of chiral symmetry - breaking , the scalar and tensor quark operators for each flavor are normalized by the corresponding quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , contributions from the tensor operator and ( from light @xmath14 quarks in the scalar operator ) are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we are left with three cases : vector interactions involving light quarks , @xmath15 ( dominated by heavy quarks ) , and direct contributions to the gluon operator .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider contributions to the gluon operator or colored and charged tree - level mediators to ( scalar or vector ) dm - quark interactions . both result from integrating out a colored heavy particle , @xmath16 to mediate the interaction . in the case of a mediator for the quark operators , </S>",
    "<S> the exchanged particle must be a color triplet carrying fractional electric charge . </S>",
    "<S> familiar examples of such particles are the squarks of a supersymmetric theory . in order to derive conservative prospects for discovery of such colored mediators , we assume they have @xmath17 couplings to dm and quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the maximum estimate for the mediator mass consistent with perturbation theory , and a maximum suppression of production at a hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> a gluon operator capable of explaining cogent is already ruled out for @xmath18 fermionic dm by a combination of direct detection and collider searches for jets + missing energy @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . for scalar dm , the gluon operator is consistent with collider data , and requires a colored mediator of mass @xmath19  gev to run in the loop in order to produce a large enough cross section .    for a @xmath16 mediating a vector interaction between @xmath7 and quarks , </S>",

    "<S> the mass of a given @xmath16 is heaviest when the other is decoupled from the theory . in this regime ( _ i.e. _  when only @xmath25 or only @xmath26 mediates direct detection ) , the signals of cogent and dama / libra require that @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this places an upper limit of @xmath28 on the quark partner mass , assuming a perturbative coupling , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 mediating the scalar operator must have even smaller mass , assuming a spin flip requiring the insertion of a fermion mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the tevatron currently places an lower limit of @xmath30 on squark masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reach for fermionic quark partners profits from a four - fold increase in production cross section from the additional spin states . excluding the full mass range for the cogent / dama mediator will have to wait for lhc data . with @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that @xmath28 squarks can be ruled out with @xmath32  fb@xmath33 of luminosity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that these estimates are based on pair production cross section at the lhc through the dominant @xmath34 fusion channel . </S>",
    "<S> we expect an additional contribution of order @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 from 250 - 500 gev ) , due to @xmath37 through @xmath38-channel dm exchange , which will improve discovery prospects .    next , we consider the case of elastic scattering mediated by a @xmath39 vector boson with a coupling of @xmath40 to dm and @xmath41 to a standard model ( sm ) fermion @xmath42 . in terms of these couplings , </S>",
    "<S> the cross section between dm and nucleons is dominated by couplings to up and down quarks and is given by @xmath43 ^ 2 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : zprimecoupling}\\ ] ] cogent / dama needs @xmath44 tev@xmath45 .    to determine conservative collider constraints , we choose @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> a heavy @xmath39 with universal couplings to sm fermions is excluded by lep , although a lighter ( @xmath510 gev ) and thus more weakly coupled @xmath39 need not be leptophobic . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf collaboration has placed constraints on @xmath39 couplings to light quarks by searching for dijet events in 1.1 fb@xmath33 of data  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zprime ] , we show how the constraints from that analysis impact this dark matter scenario . a @xmath39 with couplings to light quarks equal to those of the standard model ( sm ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 boson is ruled out over a mass range of approximately 350 to 800 gev . </S>",
    "<S> if we set the couplings to those needed to accommodate cogent and dama / libra , and require that @xmath48 , @xmath39 masses between 350 and 1150 gev are excluded by cdf . </S>",
    "<S> 1 fb@xmath33 of 7 tev lhc data is likely to discover or exclude masses up to @xmath5@xmath49 @xcite , where the quark couplings saturate perturbativity . a light @xmath39 with mass below 350 </S>",
    "<S> gev and small couplings could explain the data while evading current or near future searches . </S>",
    "<S> the sm @xmath47 is also a viable mediator . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50 coupling necessary for cogent / dama ( @xmath51 ) is within the range allowed by measurements of the invisible @xmath47 width ( @xmath52 ) @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> production cross sections times the branching fraction to dijets  @xcite ( black line and data points ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted red line represents the values predicted for a @xmath39 with sm - like couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line indicates the prediction for a @xmath39 mediating the cogent and dama / libra signals ( for @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zprime ] ]    finally , we consider dm - nucleon interactions mediated by a scalar . </S>",
    "<S> naively , one might expect that such mediators could be either singlets or doublets of @xmath54 . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , the singlet can couple directly to gauge singlet dark matter and couple to the quarks indirectly via mixing with the higgs sector . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , the doublet mediator can couple directly to the quarks , but requires that the dark matter itself consists of a mixture of @xmath54 singlets , doublets , and/or triplets ( such as mssm neutralinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> this invariably introduces heavy charged states into the dark sector , however , which must be @xmath55 in order to avoid limits from lep - ii   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this requires a large splitting between the charged and neutral states , leading to primarily singlet dm , and unacceptably small effective couplings to quarks for mediators with masses above @xmath510 gev therefore , we are forced to consider either light scalars with direct couplings to both quarks and dark matter , or a gauge singlet scalar mediator  coupling directly with the dark matter and to the quarks only through mixing with the higgs fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the dm elastic scattering cross section from the exchange of a scalar , @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 @xmath58 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 are proportional to the matrix element , @xmath60 , of quarks in a nucleons , and @xmath61 accounts for the scattering with gluons through a heavy quark loop . </S>",
    "<S> couplings of the scalar to quarks through mixing with the sm higgs are given by @xmath62 , where the exchanged scalar is a mixture of singlet and sm - like higgs : @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a cross section @xmath64 constraints from lep - ii ( @xmath65 ) rule out @xmath66 for scalar masses above about @xmath510 gev  @xcite , although a very light singlet scalar mixed only slightly with the sm higgs ( and strongly coupled to dark matter ) could plausibly account for the cross section implied by cogent and dama / libra .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we could consider the possibility of a singlet scalar that mixes with the neutral scalar higgs bosons in a model with two higgs doublets ( as in many supersymmetric models , for example ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a higgs doublet with enhanced couplings to down - type quarks can provide a relatively large elastic scattering cross section with nucleons without requiring a sub-10 gev mass for the scalar : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets and @xmath69 denotes the fraction of the singlet that is down - type higgs doublet .    </S>",
    "<S> having established several scenarios in which the signals reported by cogent and dama / libra could potentially arise , we now turn our attention to the process of dark matter annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , we would like to identify cases in which both the gamma ray signal from the galactic center , and the measured cosmological density of dark matter can be accounted for . the spectrum and angular distribution of gamma rays from the region near the galactic center can be well described by a 7.3 - 9.2 gev dark matter particle which annihilates primarily to @xmath70 ( possibly among other leptonic final states ) with a cross section ( to @xmath70 ) in the approximate range of @xmath71 to @xmath72 @xmath73/s @xcite . in order for the process of thermal freeze out in the early universe to yield a density of dark matter in accordance with the measured value of @xmath74 , the dark matter must possess an annihilation cross section ( thermally averaged at the temperature of freeze out ) of @xmath75 @xmath73/s .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the case of dm interacting through vector boson ( @xmath39 ) exchange . for scalar dm particles </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an annihilation cross section that is suppressed by @xmath76 , and thus can not produce the gamma ray signal from the galactic center . if the dm is a dirac fermion , however , the @xmath77-wave ( non - velocity suppressed ) portion of the cross section can be sizable and is given by  @xcite : @xmath78+\\gamma^2_{z ' } m^2_{z ' } } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\sum_f g^2_{ffz ' } c_f ( 1-m^2_f / m^2_{\\chi})^{1/2 } ( 2+m^2_f / m^2_{\\chi } ) , \\label{zprimesigmav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 for quarks and 1 for leptons . again fixing @xmath80 , we find that we require a value of @xmath81  </S>",

    "<S> couplings of @xmath84 to light quarks are needed to produce the cogent and dama/ libra signals . </S>",
    "<S> if we generalize these couplings to all generations , we calculate a total cross section of @xmath85  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath86 \\times 10^{-26}$ ] @xmath73/s , consistent with that required to thermally produce the measured dark matter abundance .     </S>",
    "<S> masses and couplings that can accommodate the cogent , dama / libra , and galactic center gamma ray signals ( shaded area ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have fixed the quark-@xmath39 coupling to @xmath87 , as required by cogent and dama / libra , set @xmath53 , and the dm mass to 8 gev . in the lower region , the fraction of annihilations to quarks is too high to provide a good fit to the galactic center gamma ray signal . </S>",
    "<S> the upper - right region is excluded by lep - ii . in the left region , the dm annihilates to @xmath39 pairs rather than fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the lower ( upper ) dashed contour denote the region in which the dm annihilation to @xmath70 is @xmath71 @xmath73/s ( @xmath72 @xmath73/s ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zprimeregions ] ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zprimeregions ] , we plot the range of the @xmath39 masses and couplings that can accommodate all of the signals and constraints under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded areas are the regions in which the both gamma ray signal from the galactic center and the direct detection rates reported by cogent and dama / libra can be generated .    </S>",
    "<S> next on our list of potential uv completions is the exchange of a heavy colored ( and perhaps fractionally charged ) particle either at tree or loop level . </S>",
    "<S> such objects yield annihilations only to quarks and thus will not be able to provide the gamma ray signal from the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the annihilation cross section for this process will be very small compared to that needed to provide the desired dark matter abundance , and thus would play only a minor role in the early universe .    finally , we consider dark matter annihilations mediated by a scalar . </S>",
    "<S> if the dark matter is a scalar , then this process has a large @xmath77-wave component , and will lead to the underproduction ( over annihilation ) of dm in the early universe ( unless @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , if the scalar gets its couplings to sm fermions through mixing with a scalar higgs boson , then the respective yukawa couplings will likely lead annihilations to @xmath89 to dominate over those to @xmath70 , producing a gamma ray spectrum inconsistent with that observed from the galactic center ( for an exception , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if instead the dark matter is a fermion , then the annihilation cross section is @xmath77-wave suppressed  @xcite : @xmath90+\\gamma^2_{s } m^2_{s } } \\sum_f g^2_{ffs } c_f ( 1-m^2_f / m^2_{\\chi})^{3/2}.\\ ] ] intriguingly , for the combination of @xmath91 needed to generate the signal reported by cogent and dama / libra , this automatically leads to a thermal relic abundance near @xmath74  @xcite ( assuming @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the velocity suppression , no significant gamma ray signal is predicted from this process . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to generate the observed gamma ray flux , we must introduce another annihilation process , for example an additional vector coupling dark matter to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could consider annihilations through the @xmath38-channel exchange of a particle with the quantum number of a tau lepton . </S>",
    "<S> an mssm bino - like neutralino , for instance , annihilates to @xmath70 through the exchange of a stau with a cross section of @xmath93 @xmath73/s @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> one could also consider annihilations through a pseudoscalar , which are not @xmath77-wave suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have considered an inclusive list of simple uv completions which can account for the signals reported by cogent and dama / libra , and for the gamma rays observed from the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a number of promising scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , dark matter consisting of a dirac fermion which interacts with sm quarks and leptons through the exchange of a very weakly coupled @xmath510 - 25 gev vector boson could accommodate all of these signals while also producing the observed density of dark matter through the process of thermal freeze out in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , dark matter in the form of a fermion coupled to a singlet scalar which interacts with sm fermions through mixing with higgs bosons can account for the observed elastic scattering events and yield the desired dark matter abundance , although an additional process would be needed to produce the observed flux of gamma rays . </S>"
