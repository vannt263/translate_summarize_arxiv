    "there are many possible descriptions of the spinning particles with arbitrary spin spectrum .",
    "it seems , that the most promising ones are so called spinorial models @xcite-@xcite with the internal degrees of freedom ( spin ) realized by classical , ( anti-)commuting spinors , i.e the elements of irreducible or reducible representation modules of corresponding clifford algebras , most commonly @xmath0 . despite of the fact that their construction relies on direct generalization of superparticle models they contain the particles of arbitrarily high spins .",
    "however , the masses of these particles appear to be the same once the value of the mass parameter of the model is fixed .",
    "there are also constructions @xcite which lead to spin dependent masses of the particles but , in contrast to the models mentioned above , with spin variable introduced as a free parameter .",
    "+ from this point of view the classical model defined in @xcite and analyzed in details in @xcite seems to be particulary interesting .",
    "it s construction relies on minimal coupling of the particle trajectory with vector current build up of single @xmath0 real ( majorana ) spinor . due to this coupling the resulting first quantized model describes the infinite families of spinning particles with spin - dependent masses . as the analysis at the classical level strongly indicates this is this very coupling , which corresponds to , and is responsible for spinning particles `` zitterbewegung '' phenomenon @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , which is most clearly and efficiently described in clifford algebra language .",
    "+ besides of the `` dynamical '' spin - mass coupling , the spinning particle model of @xcite and @xcite has an additional advantage : the non degenerate mass levels .",
    "unfortunately , it has also important drawback .",
    "the first quantization results in the hilbert space of states , which contains orphaned particles and antiparticles , i.e. it breaks cpt symmetry @xcite .",
    "consequently , it does not allow one to construct the corresponding local quantum field theory by direct application of the second quantization procedures @xcite .",
    "+   + the main task of this paper is to present the extended spinorial model which cures the above weakness of the prototype proposed in @xcite .",
    "the appropriate modification consists in adding an additional spinorial degree of freedom with opposite spin - mass coupling constant .",
    "the model obtained in this straightforward way contains however the non - linear interaction of spinors .",
    "this interaction is eliminated by the substraction from the lagrange function the quartic term in spinorial variables ( see ( [ int ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", one gets after first quantization , the infinitly degenerate but cpt invariant spectrum of particles . + as in the case of @xcite the paper contains also covariant formulation of the model based on the complex polarization of the second class constraints and application of gupta - bleuler quantization procedure @xcite .",
    "the polarization leads to the description of the internal degrees of freedom in terms of weyl variables i.e. in the language of even subalgebra @xmath1 spinors .",
    "this approach results in a natural generalization of dirac type equations @xcite for the particles with `` dynamical '' spin - dependent mass .",
    "+   + since the above model has cpt invariant mass spectrum , it can serve as a starting point for the construction of the local quantum field theory @xcite for particles lying on regge trajectory .",
    "it would allow one , in particular , to investigate the different kinds of field theoretical interactions of the spinning particles with arbitrary spin and with spin dependent mass in four dimensional space - time .",
    "+ as far as we know , the quantum field theoretical description of the particles lying on regge trajectories was proposed many years ago in the series of papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "apart of that , such a description was also elaborated in the framework of dual model @xcite and string theory @xcite,@xcite , but only for the critical dimension of space - time . in the case of dimension four ,",
    "the direct constructions of this kind encounter serious difficulties and problems related to the presence of liouville modes @xcite .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in the first chapter the structure of the classical model is presented in lagrangian and hamiltonian form .",
    "the complex parametrization of the spinor degrees of freedom in terms of weyl spinors is introduced in order to make the transparent link with the commonly used formalism .",
    "+ the next chapter is devoted to the description of particle content of the corresponding quantum theory .",
    "the spectrum is divided into two series : the elementary trajectories and the sector describing clusters .",
    "+ finally , the results are summarized and some open questions and problems are raised .",
    "the classical model considered in this paper is a natural generalization and extension of the one presented in @xcite .",
    "the particle content of the model of @xcite appeared to be not cpt invariant : the particles and antiparticles were orphaned .",
    "+ from the form of the mass spectrum obtained in @xcite : @xmath2 for the particles of spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 for antiparticles , one may easily conclude that in order to get rid of this undesired orphancy , it is enough to add an additional spinorial degree of freedom with opposite spin - mass coupling .",
    "the classical model obtained in such a way was already proposed in the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the following lagrange function : @xmath5 which is a straightforward extension of the one presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the standard terms describing the scalar particle of mass @xmath6 it contains `` minimal '' couplings of the velocity with two spinor currents @xmath7 the currents are build out of two independent majorana spinors @xmath8 .",
    "for the majorana spinors to exist one should assume the spacetime metric in the form @xmath9 i.e. the clifford algebra generators present in ( [ currents_two ] ) should satisfy : @xmath10 the spinorial conjugation is defined in the standard way : @xmath11 and it defines the @xmath12 invariant scalar product : @xmath13 . the explicite form of this product is not in fact needed .",
    "the only property which is used further on is that it generates @xmath14 antiautomorphism of @xmath0 clifford algebra : @xmath15 .",
    "+ the classical model defined by ( [ action ] ) appears to generate non - linear classical equations of motion .",
    "+ besides of the standard algebraic equation or @xmath16-bein variable @xmath17 and momentum conservation law : @xmath18 it contains non - linear equations of motion for spinor variables : @xmath19 the interactions of this type are absent in single spinor model of @xcite as the spin vector currents built out of single @xmath20 clifford algebra spinors are light - like .",
    "this fact can be easily proved by the use of clifford algebra structural relations without any use of explicit matrix representation .",
    "this non - trivial `` interaction '' of spinors follows from the fact that both spinors are coupled to single particle trajectory . + for this reason the model defined by ( [ action ] ) is difficult to treat technically at both : classical and quantum levels .",
    "+ the form of the equations of motion ( [ spinoreqns ] ) strongly suggests that the interaction of spinors is of potential character .",
    "it is then sensible to ask for the corresponding linearized , free model .",
    "it appears that it can be obtained by adding to ( [ action ] ) the term which describes the cross interaction of spinor currents : @xmath21 it is not difficult to check ( using the property of spinor currents @xmath22 being null and schwartz inequality ) that ( [ int ] ) is non - negative .",
    "this means that the interaction present in ( [ action ] ) and in ( [ spinoreqns ] ) is governed by non - negative potential of fourth order . as it appears the term ( [ int ] ) cancels the non - linear interactions at the hamiltonian level and one is left with relatively simple system of constraints of mixed type . on the other hand its presence leads to essential modification of the proper time parameter . as it can be calculated from the equations of motion for @xmath16-bein @xmath17 , the corresponding density gets rescaled : @xmath23 the questions related to the above change of the internal geometry of the particle trajectory are by all means interesting , but they will be not pursued here .",
    "the considerations of this paper will be focused on the hamiltonian formulation and the corresponding first quantized theory . +   + at the canonical level the model defined by the sum of ( [ action ] ) and ( [ int ] ) describes the constrained system with constraints of mixed type .",
    "their structure is analogous to that of @xcite .",
    "+ there are two families of spinorial constraints : @xmath24 relating the canonical momenta @xmath25 of spinors with spinors @xmath26 themselves .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 is the inverse of the one defined in the following way : @xmath28 . ] .",
    "+ these constraints reflect the property of the system defined by ( [ action ] ) and ( [ int ] ) that the equations of motion for spinors are of first order in the evolution parameter .",
    "they are obviously of second class : @xmath29 there is in addition the kinematic constraint related to the reparametrization invariance of the corresponding action functional .",
    "it is given by canonical dirac hamiltonian : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the momenta canonically conjugated to the positions @xmath32 .",
    "the currents @xmath33 are bilinear in spinors and their conjugated momenta : @xmath34 .",
    "the 1-bein variable was eliminated by putting @xmath35 .",
    "+ the constraints ( [ secondclasscon ] ) together with ( [ diracham ] ) constitute the closed system of mixed type as one has : @xmath36 it should be stressed that the expression ( [ diracham ] ) and the relation ( [ poissonmixed ] ) are so simple exactly due to the substraction of the fourth order term ( [ int ] ) @xmath37 from the lagrange function ( [ action ] ) .",
    "+   + as it was noted in @xcite the system of constraints ( [ secondclasscon ] ) and ( [ poissonmixed ] ) can be replaced by an equivalent system of first class by polarization of ( [ secondclasscon1])@xcite . for massive momenta",
    "@xmath38 the polarization of constraints is necessarily complex .",
    "+ for this reason the system is most conveniently described in terms of minimal building blocks of @xmath39 representations i.e. in terms of complex weyl spinors .",
    "+ the real space of majorana spinors @xmath40 decomposes into , mutually complex conjugated .",
    "] , weyl components @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "they span the eigensubspaces of @xmath43 matrix corresponding to @xmath44 eigenvalues .",
    "+ the poisson brackets of the canonical weyl variables are given as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 are @xmath48 invariant tensors . + the second class constraints of ( [ secondclasscon ] ) relate the canonical weyl coordinates : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "their polarized counterparts can be expressed in the following way : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are ( mutually complex adjoint ) matrix elements of the real operator @xmath54 in the complex basis of weyl spinors . due to clifford algebra relations they do satisfy : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "+ the hamiltonian constraint rewritten in terms of weyl variables takes the form invariant tensors @xmath46 @xmath47 and their inverses @xmath57 @xmath58 respectively . ]",
    ": @xmath59 the poisson algebra of the complex constraints can be easily calculated . from ( [ poissoncomplex ] ) and ( [ gwp ] ) it follows that : @xmath60 the functions ( [ gwp ] ) are , under the poisson bracket",
    ", the mass - weighted eigenfunctions of ( [ kinetic ] ) : @xmath61 as one should expect , the constraints @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not independent : @xmath64 hence , according to ( [ zero ] ) and ( [ masseigen ] ) , the systems @xmath65 constitute polarized poisson algebras of first class . from @xmath66 and ( [ gg ] )",
    "it follows that they are mutually complex conjugated .",
    "the hilbert space of states corresponding to the classical system under consideration , consists in square integrable functions of space - time momentum @xmath67 and weyl spinor coordinates @xmath68 . in this representation space the canonically conjugated variables are realized as the following operators : @xmath69 and @xmath70,@xmath71 .",
    "+ it should be stressed that according to the conditions imposed already at the classical level , the momenta @xmath67 are restricted to the open domain @xmath72 supporting real massive particles . since this domain is the union of two disjoint cone interiors @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the hilbert space of states decomposes into the corresponding direct sum :",
    "@xmath75 the above direct components contain the functions of the future - pointed and past - pointed momenta respectively .",
    "+ in the representation space above the operators corresponding to the spinorial constraints ( [ gwp ] ) are expressed by : @xmath76 while the dirac hamiltonian ( [ kinetic ] ) takes the following operator form : @xmath77 in order to analyze the spectrum of the model it is useful to distinguish the differential part of ( [ qham ] ) : @xmath78 as it will appear clear the operator ( [ diff ] ) is responsible for spin - mass correlation in the spectrum of the model .",
    "for this reason it will be called the spin - mass coupling operator .",
    "+   + the space of physical states of the model is defined as a kernel of either @xmath79 or @xmath80 constraints@xcite ( off - shell physical states ) and @xmath81 kinematical constraint .",
    "+ according to @xcite and the detailed analysis of the paper @xcite the physical states should be looked for within the vectors of the form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the polynomials in the weyl variables with momentum dependent coefficients .",
    "+ the space ( [ sum ] ) of the functions ( [ states ] ) splits in a natural way into the sum of the direct integrals : @xmath84 of the hilbert spaces @xmath85 and @xmath86 localized at the momentum @xmath87 , contained in @xmath88 - the future - pointed and the past - pointed cone interiors respectively .",
    "+ the states @xmath89 ( the spin vacua ) are the gaussian solutions of spinorial constraints @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to check that ( up to multiplicative factors ) they are given by : @xmath91 according to the adopted conventions the momentum matrix @xmath92 is negatively defined in the future - pointed @xmath93 light - cone interior and it is positive in past - pointed @xmath94 domain .",
    "for this reason one should take @xmath95 spin vacuum in @xmath96 and @xmath97 state in @xmath98 .",
    "this choice guarantees that the states ( [ states ] ) belong to localized hilbert space of the quantum model , i.e. they are square integrable with respect to weyl variables .",
    "it also means , that any state from @xmath99 can be represented as a superposition of the following vectors : @xmath100 of fixed integral degrees @xmath101 in @xmath102 and @xmath103 complex variables respectively .",
    "+ in the light of the above considerations one should impose @xmath79 constraints in @xmath104 and @xmath80 in @xmath105 .",
    "hence , the space @xmath106 of physical off - shell states is necessarily of the form of the following direct sum : @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the kernels of @xmath62 operators correspondingly .",
