    "as it is well known , since the seminal paper by israel @xcite , the only static and asymptotically - flat vacuum space - time possessing a regular horizon is the schwarzschild solution .",
    "all the other weyl exterior solutions @xcite , exhibit singularities in the physical components of the riemann tensor at @xmath0 .",
    "for not particularly intense gravitational fields and small fluctuations off spherical symmetry , deviations from spherical symmetry may be described as perturbations of the spherically symmetric exact solution @xcite .",
    "however , such perturbative scheme will eventually fail in regions close to the horizon ( although strictly speaking the term `` horizon '' refers to the spherically symmetric case , we shall use it when considering the @xmath0 surface , in the case of small deviations from sphericity ) .",
    "indeed , as we approach the horizon , any finite perturbation of the schwarzschild spacetime becomes fundamentally different from the corresponding exact solution representing the quasi ",
    "spherical spacetime , even if the latter is characterized by parameters whose values are arbitrarily close to those corresponding to schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "this , of course , is just an expression of the israel theorem ( for observational differences between black holes and naked singularities see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , for strong gravitational fields , no matter how small the multipole moments of the source are ( those higher than monopole ) , there exists a bifurcation between the perturbed schwarzschild metric and all the other weyl metrics ( in the case of gravitational perturbations ) .",
    "examples of such a bifurcation have been brought out in the study of the trajectories of test particles in the @xmath1 spacetime @xcite , and in the m ",
    "q spacetime @xcite,@xcite , for orbits close to @xmath2 @xcite,@xcite .    also , the influence of the quadrupole moment on the motion of test particles within the context of erez ",
    "rosen metric @xcite has been investigated by many authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain the bifurcation mentioned above , in terms of the behaviour of super ",
    "energy @xcite in a neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "this quantity , which may be defined from the bel @xcite or the bel ",
    "robinson tensor @xcite ( they both coincide in vacuum ) , has been shown to be very useful when it comes to explaining a number of phenomena in the context of general relativity .",
    "thus , for instance , it helps to explain the occurrence of vorticity in both radiative @xcite , and stationary spacetimes @xcite .",
    "also , it renders intelligible the behaviour of test particles moving in circles around the symmetry axis in an einstein ",
    "rosen spacetime @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall see how the behaviour of the instantaneous radial acceleration of a test particle ( as measured by a locally defined lorentzian observer ) in a specific spacetime of the weyl family and in regions close to the horizon , becomes intelligible when contrasted with the corresponding behaviour of superenergy .",
    "the weyl metric to be considered here is the m ",
    "q spacetime .",
    "the rationale for this choice is that due to its relativistic multipole structure , the m ",
    "q solution ( more exactly , a sub  class of this solution m ",
    "q@xmath3 , @xcite ) may be interpreted as a quadrupole correction to the schwarzschild space  time , and therefore represents a good candidate among known weyl solutions , to describe small deviations from spherical symmetry .    for this metric we shall calculate the instantaneous radial acceleration of a test particle and the superenergy .",
    "then the very peculiar behaviour of the former ( close to the horizon ) will be be explained in terms of the behaviour of the latter .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we present the weyl family of metrics we shall be concerned with and briefly discuss some of its properties ; next , in section 3 , we calculate the radial four  acceleration of test particles in such setup . in section 4 we review and discuss the concept of superenergy . in section 5",
    "we briefly describe the m ",
    "q solution and particularize the expressions for the proper radial four  acceleration and the superenergy for the case of the m  q@xmath3 metric .",
    "finally results are discussed in last section .",
    "static axisymmetric solutions to einstein s equations are given by the weyl metric @xcite @xmath4 , \\label{elin}\\ ] ] for vacuum spacetimes , einstein s field equations imply for the metric functions @xmath5 and @xmath6    notice that ( [ meq1 ] ) is just the laplace equation for @xmath7 ( in 2dimensional euclidean space ) ; furthermore , it is precisely the integrability condition for ( [ meq2 ] ) , that is : given @xmath7 , a function @xmath8 satisfying ( [ meq2 ] ) always exists . since in the weak field limit @xmath7",
    "is related to the newtonian gravitational potential , this result may be stated as saying that for any `` newtonian '' potential there always exists a specific weyl metric , a well known result .",
    "an interesting way of writing the general solution of ( [ meq1 ] , [ meq2 ] ) was obtained by erez - rosen @xcite and quevedo @xcite , using prolate spheroidal coordinates , which are defined as follows @xmath9^{1/2 } \\\\ x & \\geq & 1 \\quad , \\quad -1 \\leq y \\leq 1 , \\label{pro } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant which will be identified later with the schwarzschild s mass .",
    "the prolate coordinate @xmath11 represents a radial coordinate , whereas the other coordinate , @xmath12 represents the cosine function of the polar angle .    in these prolate spheroidal coordinates , @xmath7 takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the legendre functions of first and second kind respectively , and @xmath16 a set of arbitrary constants . the corresponding expression for the function @xmath8 , may be found in @xcite .",
    "in order to find an expression for the instantaneous radial acceleration of test particles , it is useful to start from the geodesic equations .    these can be derived from the lagrangian @xmath17 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath18 , which for timelike geodesics coincides with the proper time .",
    "then , from euler - lagrange equations it follows , @xmath19 we shall not need the full set of geodesic equations , therefore we shall display only the one involving radial acceleration @xmath20 where , instead of cylindrical coordinates @xmath21 , we found useful to work with erez - rosen coordinates @xmath22 given by : @xmath23 \\rho & = ( r^2 - 2 m r)^{1/2 } \\sin\\theta \\end{aligned } \\label{(28)}\\ ] ] which are related to prolate coordinates , by @xmath24 y & = \\cos\\theta \\end{aligned } \\label{(29)}\\ ] ]    since we are concerned only with timelike geodesics , the range of our coordinates is : @xmath25    let us now consider the motion of a test particle along a radial geodesic , for an arbitrary value of @xmath26 . thus putting @xmath27 in ( [ ere ] ) , and using the constraint ( for radial geodesics )",
    "@xmath28    we obtain @xmath29    it should be kept in mind that we are not interested in a full description of the motion of test particles ( we are not going to integrate the full set of geodesic equations ) , but only in the expression for the radial acceleration of a test particle at any given time . accordingly we shall not need to take into consideration the constraints impossed on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and so on , from the the other geodesic equations , for the radial motion .    in order to express our results in terms of physically meaningful quantities ,",
    "let us introduce ( locally defined ) coordinates associated with a locally minkowskian observer ( or alternatively , a tetrad field associated with such a minkowskian observer ) .",
    "thus , let @xmath32 and @xmath33 it then follows that @xmath34 } } \\label{radial6}\\ ] ] and @xmath35 ^ 2- \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 \\frac{g_{rr , r}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2\\right]}{2(-g_{rr})^{3/2}}. \\label{radial7}\\ ] ] in the spherically symmetric case , ( [ radial7 ] ) reduces to @xmath36 \\left(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\right)^{-1/2 } , \\label{ss}\\ ] ] or , introducing the variable @xmath37 @xmath38(r-2)^{-1/2 } , \\label{ssr}\\ ] ] which is a known result . since @xmath39 is always smaller than one , the attractive nature of gravity for any value of @xmath40 ( larger than @xmath2 ) is clearly exhibited in ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "as it is known , in classical field theory , energy is a quantity defined in terms of potentials and their first derivatives . in general relativity",
    "however , it is impossible to construct a tensor expressed only through the metric and their first derivatives ( the equivalence principle ) .",
    "accordingly , a local description of gravitational energy in terms of true invariants ( tensors of any rank ) is not possible within the context of the theory .",
    "thus , one is left with the following three alternatives :    * looking for a non  local definition of energy * finding a definition based on pseudo  tensors * resorting to a succedaneous definition , e.g. : superenergy .    in this work",
    "we are going to explore the last alternative .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the motivations for doing so are given by the rich and profound physical meaning of such quantity .",
    "superenergy @xmath41 may be defined from either the bel or the bel ",
    "robinson tensor @xcite .",
    "since we are working with vacuum spacetimes both definitions coincide , and one then has :    @xmath42    with @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the weyl tensor , @xmath46 is the levi  civita tensor and @xmath47 is the four  velocity of observers at rest in the frame of ( [ elin ] ) , i.e. @xmath48    observe that since we are working with static spacetimes , the magnetic part of the weyl tensor ( @xmath49 ) vanishes identically .",
    "let us next briefly introduce the metric we shall consider here , and calculate the corresponding expressions for the radial acceleration of a test particle and the superenergy .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that it is possible to find a metric of the weyl family , such that the resulting solution possesses only monopole and quadrupole moments ( in the geroch sense @xcite ) . the obtained solution ( m  q )",
    "may be written as follows : @xmath51 where the zeroth order corresponds to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "@xmath52 with @xmath53 and it appears that each power in @xmath54 adds a quadrupole correction to the spherically symmetric solution .",
    "now , it should be observed that due to the linearity of laplace equation , these corrections give rise to a series of exact solutions . in other words ,",
    "the power series of @xmath54 may be cut at any order , and the partial summation , up to that order , gives an exact solution representing a quadrupolar correction to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "since we are interested in slight deviations from spherical symmetry , we shall consider the m ",
    "q solution , only up to the first order in @xmath54 ( m  q@xmath3 ) ; with @xmath55 corresponding to an oblate ( prolate ) source .",
    "thus , the explicit solution up to the first order , describing a quadrupolar correction to the monopole ( schwarzschild solution ) , may be interpreted as the gravitational field outside a quasi  spherical source , and it is given by ( note a missprint in equation ( 13 ) in @xcite ) @xmath56 & \\times \\bigg[\\left(\\frac{3x^2 - 1}4 -\\frac1{3y^2 - 1}\\right ) \\ln\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x+1}\\right ) \\\\[0.2 cm ] & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad -\\frac{2x}{(x^2-y^2)(3y^2 - 1 ) } + \\frac{3x}2 \\bigg ] \\ ; , \\label{(25 ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath57\\ln\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x+1}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{225}{1024}q^2(x^2 - 1)(1-y^2)(x^2+y^2 - 9x^2y^2 - 1 ) \\ln^2\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x+1}\\right ) \\label{(26 ) } \\\\ & - \\frac{15}4 q(1-y^2)\\left[1-\\frac{15}{64}q(x^2 + 4y^2 - 9x^2y^2 + 4)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & - \\frac{75}{16}q^2 x^2\\frac{1-y^2}{x^2-y^2 } - \\frac{5}{4}q(x^2+y^2 ) \\frac{1-y^2}{(x^2-y^2)^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & - \\frac{75}{192}q^2(2x^6-x^4 + 3x^4y^2 - 6x^2y^2 + 4x^2y^4-y^4-y^6 ) \\frac{1-y^2}{(x^2-y^2)^4 }   \\quad . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in @xcite it was shown that the behaviour of test particles in the m ",

    "we shall next discuss the results obtained so far .",
    "the first conclusion which emerges from figures and is that , close to the horizon , the behaviour of the test particle ( in what concerns @xmath69 ) is extremely abnormal , as expected from israel s theorem .",
    "thus for the m  q@xmath3 metric with @xmath70 it appears that a test particle placed on the axis of symmetry in the neighbourhood of the horizon does not feel any attraction from the source ( @xmath71 ) . still more shocking : as we move outwards ( always on the symmetry axis ) , the magnitude of @xmath66 increases with @xmath72 , until some value of @xmath72 , from which it starts to `` behave '' properly ( figure ) .",
    "this pathological behaviour of @xmath69 is fully consistent with that of superenergy in the same range of @xmath72 , as indicated in figure .",
    "indeed , @xmath41 also vanishes close to the horizon , increasing as we move outwards along the symmetry axis , until we are far away enough from the horizon and the expected behaviour is recovered .",
    "for @xmath73 the situation is still more unusual . indeed , on a neighbourhood of the horizon , on the axis of symmetry , @xmath74 , implying that the particle experiences a repulsive force .",
    "this effect is restricted to values of @xmath72 very close to @xmath75 .",
    "as we move away from the horizon the proper acceleration becomes negative , although still displaying an abnormal behaviour since it increases in magnitude with @xmath72 .",
    "moving further away from the origin ( along the symmetry axis ) we recover the `` normal '' behaviour ( @xmath69 ( negative and decreasing with @xmath72 ) . the dependence of @xmath41 with @xmath72 in this case , displayed in figure , is consistent with the graphics of @xmath69 above .",
    "indeed , in a neighborhood of the horizon , @xmath41 is singular and so is its derivative with respect to @xmath72 , this explaining the pathological behaviour of @xmath69 in that range of values of @xmath72 .",
    "as we move sufficiently far away from @xmath76 we recover the expected behaviour .",
    "thus we have seen that the concept of superenergy is a suitable measure of the strength of gravitational interaction , even in highly pathological situations .",
    "the fact that it is a true scalar ( obtained from a true tensor ) reinforces further its relevance in the study of self  gravitating systems .",
