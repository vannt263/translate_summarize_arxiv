    "light squeezing is an important physical concept that continues to attract attention of researchers due to its potential for implementing quantum information processing and quantum computing . as an alternative to single - photon schemes , the demonstration of the einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) paradox and quantum teleportation with continuous variables have been realized experimentally by using the entanglement from squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "moreover , experimental progress in the study of various quantum information processing with squeezed states generated from optical fibers has recently been reported  @xcite . to increase the entanglement fidelity of continuous variables ,",
    "the enhancement of squeezing effect becomes very vital .",
    "original proposals to generate squeezed states from optical fibers are based on the use of the fundamental solitons supported by the kerr nonlinearity of silica glass .",
    "temporal ( pulse ) solitons in optical fibers are described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) that can exhibit quadrature - field squeezing @xcite as well as amplitude squeezing  @xcite , and both intra - pulse and inter - pulse correlations  @xcite . besides the exact quantum soliton nlse solutions constructed by using the bethe ansatz  @xcite ,",
    "the quantum properties of temporal solitons are well described by the linearization approach  @xcite for the average photon number as high as @xmath1 .",
    "based on this linearization approach , many different numerical methods have been developed during the past two decades in order to study quantum noise associated with nonlinear pulse propagation , including the positive-@xmath2 representation  @xcite , back - propagation method  @xcite , and the cumulant expansion technique  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the soliton squeezing from a sagnac fiber interferometer , 1.7 db below the shot noise , was first observed in 1991 by rosenbluh and shelby  @xcite . since that , larger quadrature squeezing from fibers has been obtained with a gigahertz erbium - doped fiber lasers that allow to suppress the guided acoustic - wave brillouin scattering , and 6.1 db noise reduction below the shot noise has been reported  @xcite . as an attempt to enhance the soliton squeezing effect , one may increase the energy of an optical soliton enhancing the importance of nonlinear effects and , employing this idea , 7.1 db photon - number squeezing has been demonstrated by using spectral filters  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the basic model of the pulse propagation in optical fibers described by nlse possesses more general @xmath3soliton solutions which can be obtained , for example , by applying the inverse scattering transform  @xcite . as was demonstrated , such higher - order ( @xmath4 ) solitons can be more squeezed since they contain @xmath5 times of the energy than the fundamental soliton  @xcite ; as an example , up to 8.4 db enhancement was predicted for the @xmath6 soliton states  @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that all previous studies of the soliton quantum noise and quantum squeezing of higher - order solitons have employed a very special case of two - soliton states generated by a simple sech - like input pulse .",
    "however , a general nlse solution describing the @xmath7-soliton state is characterized by n free parameters which can be controlled independently . in this paper",
    ", we develop the theory of quantum noise and quantum squeezing in the context of the multi - soliton states and apply it to study squeezing of the general @xmath7-soliton bound states of nlse . in particular , we reveal that the conventional sech - like single - hump pulses are not the most suitable pulses for generating highly squeezed states and , using the case of the general two - parameter solution for @xmath6 solitons as an example , we show that an input double - hump soliton is better for generating strongly squeezed states , even such solitons have the same energy as the single - hump pulses .",
    "the enhancement of the squeezing effect is explained by the long collision period of a double - hump soliton , consequently the pulse profile is more stationary for getting squeezed .",
    "since these double - hump solitons have also been generated in the fiber laser systems , more strongly squeezed state from optical fibers are expected to be realized with the current technology .",
    "solitons with ( a ) @xmath8 , and ( b ) @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig_f3].,title=\"fig:\",width=153 ]    to describe the pulses propagating in optical fibers with the anomalous dispersion and kerr - type nonlinearity , one employ the nlse model written for the normalized variables , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pulse envelope . according to the results of the inverse scattering transform @xcite , this equation possesses exact solutions describing interaction of @xmath7 solitons , which are characterized by a set of complex variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the complex @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the `` poles '' and the `` residues '' of the corresponding scattering data @xcite .",
    "in particular , such solutions describe the so - called @xmath3soliton bound states ( also called `` breathers '' ) when all solitons have vanishing velocities at the infinity , and their interaction leads to the formation of a spatially localized but time - periodic state .",
    "the full set of such solutions for the @xmath6 soliton bound states can be written as  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21}\\\\\\nonumber & + & \\frac{4\\eta_1}{(\\eta_2-\\eta_1)^2}\\cos{[}2(\\eta_2 ^ 2-\\eta_1 ^ 2 ) z { ] } + { \\rm cosh}{[}2(\\eta_1+\\eta_2 ) z{]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two free parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are the imaginary parts of the poles in the scattering data , i.e. @xmath24 , and the residues are related to the poles by the relations @xmath25 when @xmath26 , the soliton solution at @xmath27 has a specific , sech - like single - hump initial profile , @xmath28 as shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig_f1](a ) .",
    "however , when the ratio of @xmath29 becomes larger than @xmath30 , the initial profile of the @xmath6 soliton solution becomes double - humped , as shown in the insert of fig .",

    "@xcite to calculate the quantum fluctuations of a full set of the @xmath6 soliton solutions . to evaluate the quantum fluctuations around the bound solitons , we replace the classical function @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) by the quantum - field operator variable , @xmath35 , which satisfies the equal - coordinate bosonic commutation relations .",
    "next , we substitute the expansion @xmath36 into eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) to linearize it around the classical solution @xmath37 for the soliton containing a large number of photons",
    ". then we calculate the quantum uncertainty of the output field by back - propagating the output field to the input field with the assumption that the statistics of the input quantum - field operators obey the poisson distribution .",
    "in particular , we calculate the squeezing ratio , defined below , of the output field based on the homodyne detection scheme  @xcite , @xmath38}{\\mathrm{var}[\\langle f_{l}(t)|\\hat{u}(0,t)\\rangle ] } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] stands for the variance , @xmath40 is the normalized classical pulse solution in the output with an adjustable phase shift , @xmath41 which acts as a local oscillator .",
    "the optimal ( minimum ) value of the squeezing ratio @xmath42 can be chosen by varying the parameter @xmath43 . when @xmath44 , the in - phase quadrature component is detected , and when @xmath45 , the out - of - phase quadrature component is detected .",

    "dashed line shows the optimal squeezing ratio curve for the case of the @xmath47 soliton.,width=288 ]    based on the formulation above , now we calculate the optimal quadrature squeezing ratios for a full set of the @xmath6 soliton bound states in fig .  [ fig_f2 ] . compared to the optimal squeezing ratio of the fundamental soliton ( dashed line ) , all @xmath6 solitons get more squeezed in the beginning of their propagation because they contain more energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , after a certain propagation distance , the optimal squeezing ratio of the @xmath6 soliton state change periodically due to the oscillating behavior of the breather , with the period of the @xmath6 soliton  @xcite , @xmath48 however , if we compare the optimal squeezing ratios between the @xmath6 solitons with different ratios @xmath29 , we find that solitons with larger @xmath29 are more squeezed , even all of them have the same energy .",
    "the reason that a @xmath6 soliton with a larger @xmath29 gets more squeezed can be inducted from the comparison of the optimal squeezing ratio with that of the @xmath47 soliton . when the propagation distance is large enough ( beyond the propagation range shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig_f2 ] ) , there is a oscillating tail in the optimal squeezing ratio of the @xmath47 soliton coming form the continuum part of the noise due to the use of the same pulse profile as the local oscillator .",
    "but basically the optimal squeezing ratio of the fundamental soliton increases monochromatically along the propagation distance due to the stationary characteristic of the pulses . on the contrary ,",
    "the oscillation nature of @xmath6 solitons prevent the increase of the optimal squeezing ratio after a certain degree . since a @xmath6 soliton with larger ratio of @xmath29 has a longer collision period , as shown in eq .",

    "this may be the reason that makes a double - hump @xmath6 soliton states get more squeezed than a single - hump one , although there are also some strongly anti - correlated patterns for a single - hump soliton in the far range where the soliton fourier component almost vanish . and",
    "only strongly _ positive _ correlated patterns occur in the center parts of both solitons , when the @xmath6 solitons merge into a single pulse .",
