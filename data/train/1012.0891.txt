    "the narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , which extend to several hundred or kilo parsec scale around the galaxy center , are the exclusive structure of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) where the spatially resolved observations are possible .",
    "therefore nlrs are often investigated as an important tool to study the ionization state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and/or chemical evolution in galactic scale ( e.g. , ) .",
    "although it is widely accepted that the nlr is photoionized by ionizing photons radiated from a central engine , the possibility of shock ionization induced by a jet in off nucleus regions can not be excluded since ionization photons decrease with distance from a nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , how much the shock contributes to the ionization of nlrs is very important to our understanding of agn structure and in examining the utility of nlrs as a tool to investigate galactic - scale phenomena .",
    "furthermore , the shock ionization of nlrs is getting a lot more attention .",
    "recent dramatic progress of theoretical simulations and observational studies of galaxy formation and evolution allow a quantitative comparison between both sides . in this context , a serious problem has arisen , i.e. , theoretical simulations predict too many massive galaxies due to long - duration star formations in contrast to early - time quenching of star formation in observed massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". this problem can not be solved even if a negative feedback effect on star formation activity caused by supernovae is involved and so agn feedback effect is considered as a potential candidate of a solution : a massive galaxy likely has a supermassive black hole at its galaxy center , and inflow of ism to a supermassive black hole invokes its agn activity which releases vast gravitational potential energy to ism resulting in suppression of star formation activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , how the agn activity transmits its energy to ism remains a mystery .",
    "one possible physical mechanism of the agn feedback is shock ionization of ism , i.e. , the agn activity inputs its energy to ism through a shock heating induced by a jet .    in previous studies of nlrs ,",
    "line - ratio diagnostics to distinguish between shock ionization and photoionization have been examined .",
    "optical diagnostics , however , can hardly discriminate between the two mechanisms , because optical nlr spectra predicted by photoionization and shock ionization models are very similar to each other @xcite . the near infrared line ratio of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m is one of the most powerful indicators to discriminate photoionization and shock ionization .",
    "both lines have similar critical densities and excitation temperatures , i.e. , this line ratio is roughly proportional to the ratio of gas - phase abundance of iron and phosphorous . in contrast , iron is a well known refractory species and is strongly depleted in dust grains , whereas phosphorous is a non - refractory species .",
    "photoionization alone ( including h ii regions and nlrs excited by ionizing photons from young stars and agn central sources , respectively ) is relatively incapable of destroying the tough iron based grains , while these are easily sputtered by shocks .",
    "the [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m ratio , therefore , is high ( @xmath4 ) in fast shock - excited regions and low ( @xmath5 ) in normal photoionized regions .",
    "the actual ionization state of nlrs would be determined by the combination of photoionization and shock ionization , and so the observed line ratios are expected to change with the locations in nlrs ranging from [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "ngc 1068 is one of the nearest agns , which has a compact radio jet around the nucleus and spatially extended radio lobe @xcite .",
    "this radio structure well coincides with a morphology of nlr @xcite .",
    "therefore , ngc 1068 is an ideal object with which to research the spatial distribution of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m . in this paper",
    ", we adopt 14.4 mpc as a distance to ngc 1068 and 1@xmath8 corresponds to 70 pc .",
    "before describing the details of observation and data reduction , we summarize the theoretical background of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1 m and [ p ii]1.188@xmath1 m emission lines .",
    "the emission line intensity is proportional to the product of the density of the ion responsible for the emission line process ( @xmath9 ) and the electron density ( @xmath10 ) , multiplied by a function @xmath11 giving the rate of the process .",
    "thus the intensity ratio of two emission lines radiated from ion 1 and 2 is written as @xmath12 assuming the same spatial distribution of both ions @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath11 involves the rate of emission line photons in the radiative transition from the excited level to the ground level written as @xmath13^{-1}.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the radiative transition probability , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are collisional excitation and deexcitation rate , which include collisional strength ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath11 can be calculated if @xmath18 and @xmath17 are known .",

    "( @xmath21 ) and p ( @xmath22 because of refractory species ) , equation ( [ abundance ] ) gives [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m close to unity , although the depletion factor of iron differs from object to object .",
    "actually , [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m is @xmath5 in normal photoionized region , e.g. , @xmath6 in orion bar .",
    "this is also true for nlr ionized by agn radiation because even ionizing photons from agn central source can hardly destroy the tough iron based grains in nlr .",
    "however if shocks exist the grains are easily destroyed and gas - phase iron increases . as a result shock ionized gas represents high [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m ratio .",
    "if we assume that iron based grains are completely sputtered by shocks , the ratio becomes @xmath23 for solar abundance .",
    "this is similar to that measured in supernova remnants ( e.g. , @xmath4 for lmc - n63a and lmc - n49 reported by ) .",
    "the actual observed line ratio in nlr of agn is expected to be between @xmath6 and @xmath7 since the ionization state would be determined by the combination of photoionization and shock ionization if these exist as mentioned in section [ introduction ] .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy was carried out from november 8 to 12 2009 with isle @xcite , which is a near - infrared imager and spectrograph for the cassegrain focus of the 1.88 m telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) .",
    "the camera used for the spectroscopic observations has a projected scale of 0@xmath8.25/pixel .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 1068 was obtained with a slit of 2@xmath8.0 (= 8 pixels ) width and @xmath0-band grating which yields a @xmath24 m spectrum with a dispersion of 0.166 @xmath1m / pix .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath25 1300 measured from an oh emission line at the central wavelength .",
    "the slit was oriented to e - w ( i.e. , position angle = 90@xmath26 ) and centered on the @xmath0-band continuum peak of ngc 1068 ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the position angle is fixed to 90@xmath26 in isle spectroscopic mode .",
    "therefore , the slit was not placed along the major axis of nlr and the direction of the radio structure , at a position angle of @xmath25 30 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it lies outside of the nominal bicone of nlr and away from the axis of radio emission .",
    "unfortunately other slit positions north and south of the nucleus could not be completed due to bad weather conditions .",
    "the acquisition consisted of a series of two 2-minute exposures with the object set at different positions along the slit followed by dome flats and calibration lamp of argon and xenon .",
    "the seeing size was 1@xmath8.0 - 2@xmath8.0 .",
    "since the weather conditions were not good throughout the observation , we excluded poor data from a total 6-hour exposure on source , resulting in the effective exposure time of 4.4 hours on source .",
    "the standard data reduction was performed for all selected spectra , i.e. , dark frame subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction using iraf software . to correct the atmospheric spectral response and the instrumental efficiency , spectra of ngc 1068",
    "were divided by spectra of some a - type rationing stars ( hip5310 , hip10795 , hip14077 , and hip22774 ) with the same airmass . in this reduction ,",
    "the black body and pa@xmath27 absorption features of rationing stars were removed by spectral fitting with a black body function and voigt profile , respectively .",
    "the assumed effective temperatures of rationing stars are 8270 , 7500 , 8200 , and 9230 k for hip5310 ( a3v ) , hip10795 ( a7v ) , hip14077 ( a5v ) , and hip22774 ( a1v ) , respectively .",
    "the obtained 2-d spectra of ngc 1068 are displayed in fig . [ figure2 ] .",
    "we detected [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1 m and [ p ii]1.188@xmath1 m lines as well as pa@xmath27 and [ s ix]1.252@xmath1 m .",
    "the spatial extent of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1 m and [ p ii]1.188@xmath1 m are @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ". these values are clearly larger than the typical seeing size of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we concluded that spatially extended [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1 m and [ p ii]1.188@xmath1 m were successfully detected .",
    "the line fluxes were measured from spectral fitting analysis with iraf @xmath31 task @xcite , assuming single gauss and underlying linear functions for each emission line .",
    "we summarized relative line fluxes normalized by [ p ii]1.188@xmath1 m in table [ table ] , extracted from central 2@xmath8.0 region and east and west neighbor regions .",
    "the detailed spatial distribution of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m line ratios is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( a ) .    reported that the line ratio in the central @xmath25 2@xmath8 region of ngc 1068 is about 1.5 . since this value corresponds with the photoionization scheme as mentioned above",
    ", they concluded that in the central region most iron is locked into grains and shock excitation is not the primary origin of [ fe ii ] line emission .",
    "this explanation is relatively straightforward because there would be a large number of ionizing photons near the nucleus , that is enough to dominate the ionization of surrounding gases .",
    "our measurement of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m @xmath25 1.3 in the central 2@xmath8 region is consistent with this value .",
    "however , this argument may not be valid at off nucleus regions .",
    "we found that [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m increases with distance from a central continuum peak .",
    "while observed line ratios around the nucleus are consistent with a prediction by photoionization models , the ratios at 3@xmath8 @xmath32 4@xmath8 east and west of the nucleus ( @xmath25 560 pc ) are slightly higher than the typical value of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m in the photoionized region .",
    "although there are only two research efforts devoted to the spatial distribution of [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m ratios of nlrs ( ngc 4151 by @xcite and mrk 1066 by @xcite ) , similar results were reported in both cases .",
    "@xcite found that [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m ratios are higher at @xmath25 130 pc away from the nucleus of ngc 4151 ( @xmath33 ) than that in its nucleus ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they also pointed out a possible spatial correlation between [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m and radio continuum structure .",
    "they suggested that shocks induced by a radio jet release the fe locked in grains and produce an enhancement of the [ fe ii ] emission at off nucleus regions .",
    "similarly @xcite found that mrk 1066 presents [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m @xmath34 at most locations within @xmath35 pc from the nucleus , but in some regions close to the borders of the radio continuum structure this ratio reaches values up to 9.5 .",
    "they concluded that shocks seem to play a more important role in these regions .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( b ) shows vla 4.86 ghz flux density as a function of distance from the nucleus of ngc 1068 extracted from a same slit aperture as our near - infrared observation with oao / isle .",

    "we find a possible association between [ fe ii]1.257@xmath1m/[p ii]1.188@xmath1 m and the radio continuum like ngc 4151 and mrk 1066 .",
    "the higher ratios at off nucleus of ngc 1068 is likely attributed to a mild contribution of shock ionization to ionized gases .",
    "this may indicate that the interaction between the jet and ism forms an expanding cocoon which induces the shock waves propagating perpendicularly in the direction of the jet axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while photoionization by central engine is dominant near the nucleus .",
