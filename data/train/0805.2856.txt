    "nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) is applicable for a description of ground - state properties throughout the nuclear chart  @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the theorem by hohenberg and kohn  @xcite , and its practical applications are based on the self - consistent mean - field theory with density - dependent energy functionals  @xcite . within nuclear dft ,",
    "the solution of the quantum nuclear many - body problem is relatively simple .",
    "the problem is , of course , with the construction of the energy functional .",
    "most approaches to the nuclear energy - density functional are empirical in nature , and the inclusion of pairing properties@xcite is particularly important and challenging .",
    "there are only a few non - empirical approaches to the nuclear energy - density functional .",
    "the density - matrix expansion pioneered by negele and vautherin  @xcite expands the non - diagonal one - body density matrix along its diagonal , and the expectation value of a hamiltonian thus leads to an energy - density functional . in another formal approach  @xcite , the energy - density functional",
    "is constructed as the legendre transform of the ground - state energy as a functional of external one - body potentials .",
    "this approach is closely related to the hohenberg - kohn theorem  @xcite . however ,",
    "its starting point , i.e. the ground - state energy of a quantum many - body system as a functional of any external potential , is only available for a few solvable or weakly interacting systems .",
    "furnstahl and co - workers  @xcite followed this path and derived energy - density functionals for dilute fermi gases with short - ranged interactions . for fermi gases in the unitary regime ,",
    "simple scaling arguments suggest the form of the energy density functional  @xcite .    in nuclear physics , energy - density functional theory is a practical tool that is popular due to its computational simplicity and success .",
    "the universality of the functional , i.e. the possibility to study nucleons in external potentials , is seldom used .",
    "this distinguishes nuclear dft from dft in coulomb systems and makes alternative formulations worth studying . for computational simplicity",
    ", we would like to maintain the framework of an energy functional .",
    "however , there is no need to focus on functionals of the density . the description and interpretation of nuclear systems",
    "is often based on shell - model orbitals rather than densities .",
    "for instance , in nuclear structure , one is often more interested in the occupation of a given shell - model orbital or the isospin - dependence of the effective single - particle energies than in the shape of the density distribution .",
    "this language is natural for shell - model hamiltonians that are based on single - particle orbitals .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study and construct the energy functional of such a system .",
    "recently , the energy functional ( in terms of occupation numbers ) was constructed for the pairing hamiltonian  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the three - level lipkin model  @xcite .",
    "this is another solvable model that is relevant for nuclei",
    ". we will be able to gain insight into the formulations of energy functionals for two - body interactions that exhibit a continuous symmetry , and will study the effect of symmetry - breaking one - body potentials .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ degen ] we construct the energy functional of the three - level lipkin model with degenerate excited levels .",
    "we study the implications of symmetry - breaking one - body potentials in sect .",
    "[ symbreak ] , and conclude with our summary .",
    "we consider the three - level lipkin model  @xcite and follow the work by hagino and bertsch  @xcite .",
    "this model consists of @xmath0 fermions that are distributed over three levels ( labeled as 0 , 1 , and 2 ) consisting of @xmath0 degenerate , single - particle states each .",
    "the single - particle energies are @xmath1 , and the two excited levels are degenerate , @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian is h&=&(_1+_2 ) + & & -(k_1k_1+k_2k_2+k^_1k^_1+k^_2k^_2 )  .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] here , _ = _",

    "we assume @xmath5 for the spacing to the degenerate levels 1 and 2 .",
    "the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 create and annihilate a fermion in state @xmath8 of level @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under the simultaneous orthogonal transformation of the @xmath0 orbitals belonging to each level , and this symmetry facilitates the numerical solution of this problem  @xcite .",
    "note that the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under orthogonal transformations of states belonging to the degenerate levels 1 and 2 , i.e. [ symmetry ] (    c c_1 i^ + c_2 i^    ) (    rr & + - &    ) (    c c_1 i^ + c_2 i^    )  .",
    "this symmetry will be broken by the hartree - fock ( hf ) solution ( see below ) , and we will study the explicit breaking of this symmetry by additional one - body terms of the hamiltonian in sect .",
    "[ symbreak ] .",
    "the energy functional is the legendre transform @xmath9 here [ nocc ] n ( ) is the ground - state occupation of levels 1 and 2 , while @xmath10 is the ground - state energy as a function of the spacing @xmath11 .",
    "the exact ground - state energy can be obtained numerically by diagonalizing a matrix of modest dimensions  @xcite , and one can thus construct easily the exact energy functional .",
    "however , we are interested in gaining analytical insight into the problem . for this reason , we employ the analytical expression by hagino and bertsch  @xcite that expresses the ground - state energy in terms of the hf energy and corrections due to the rpa .",
    "the hf result depends on the size of the parameter @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the effective strength of the two - body coupling @xmath14 in the @xmath0-body system .",

    "the approximate solution exhibits a cusp at the boundary @xmath20 between the spherical and deformed phases , but it agrees well with the exact result away from the phase boundary . note that the cusp renders the rpa solution non - convex , and its legendre transform is therefore not possible close to the phase boundary . within the rpa formalism",
    ", the occupation number  ( [ nocc ] ) attains non - physical negative values close to the cusp .",
    "we will avoid this problem in the construction presented below .",
    "let us start with the analytical construction of the energy functional  ( [ funcexact1 ] ) in the spherical phase . here , the rpa solution is convex .",
    "we have @xmath21 this equation can easily be solved for @xmath22 , and the functional thus reads @xmath23    thus , for small occupation numbers ( i.e. the weak coupling limit @xmath24 ) , the functional is nonanalytical and exhibits a square root singularity .",
    "this is a rather generic feature of energy functionals and is also seen in the energy functional for the pairing hamiltonian .",
    "we next turn to the deformed case @xmath25 .",
    "the occupation number is n()= -n-12 v-  .",
    "[ occnumdeformed ] equation  ( [ occnumdeformed ] ) is difficult to invert analytically because of the term involving the square root .",
    "note that this term also renders the occupation number negative as @xmath11 approaches @xmath26 .",
    "we avoid this problem by expanding eq .",
    "( [ occnumdeformed ] ) in powers of @xmath12 , approximate @xmath27 , and keep up to orders @xmath28 in the resulting expression .",
    "the result is @xmath29 insertion of this result and eq .",
    "( [ erg2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ funcexact1 ] ) yields the density functional in the deformed phase .",
    "note that the energy functional is analytical in the strong coupling limit @xmath30 .",
    "again , this is a generic feature of energy functionals and was also exhibited in the pairing problem .",
    "figure  [ funcfig ] compares the exact energy functional with the rpa solutions obtained in the spherical and deformed phase for @xmath19 .",
    "note that the spherical ( deformed ) phase corresponds to sufficiently small ( large ) occupation numbers .",
    "the inset shows that the rpa solution has a kink at the critical occupation number @xmath31 at the phase transition .",
    "note also that the solution of the deformed phase is a good approximation over the entire range @xmath32 , although its derivation employed the approximation @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath34 , see eq .",
    "( [ occnumdeformed ] ) .",
    "how severe is the presence of the kink at @xmath35 in the functional ? to address this question , we employ the rpa functional in practical calculations .",
    "we add the one - body term @xmath36 to the functional and numerically determine the occupation number @xmath37 that minimizes the ground - state energy @xmath38    the energy taken at the minimum is plotted as a function of the minimizing occupation number @xmath37 in fig .  [ functest ] . the result",
    "is also compared to the exact numerical result .",
    "we see that the energy functional , obtained via rpa , provides a good prediction of the ground state energy function of the three - level lipkin model . at the phase transition ,",
    "however , the functional predicts multiple values for the ground state energy , due to the discontinuity in the derivative at the phase transition .",
    "thus , for external potentials @xmath39 the energy functional does not provide good predictive power , and the relatively small kink visible in the inset of fig .",

    "the two - body interaction and the one - body terms of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are invariant under the symmetry transformation  ( [ symmetry ] ) . in this section",
    "we study the breaking of this symmetry by a one - body potential , i.e. we lift the degeneracy of levels 1 and 2 in the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and modify its one - body term as follows @xmath40 the two - body interaction remains the same .",
    "technically it is convenient to substitute @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) and to add the term @xmath42 to the resulting expression .",
    "this approach is particularly convenient for the rpa calculation .",
    "the question of symmetry - breaking is an important one .",
    "the energy functional corresponds to the symmetry - preserving two - body interaction that is probed by a symmetry - breaking one - body potential .",
    "thus , the functional depends on two variables ( the occupation numbers of levels 1 and 2 ) , and we are interested in the form of this functional and in its relation to the functional of the symmetry - preserving case .",
    "we thereby hope to get insights into energy functionals for atomic nuclei .",
    "the nuclear shell model , for instance , employs a spherically symmetric two - body interaction , but deformed nuclei are often described within a deformed mean - field basis that breaks the rotational invariance through one - body terms .",
    "the numerical calculations are simple and require only a minor modification of the matrix elements corresponding to the one - body terms . for the analytical construction of the functional , we have to perfom the hf and rpa calculations .",
    "we adapt the hf calculation of ref .",
