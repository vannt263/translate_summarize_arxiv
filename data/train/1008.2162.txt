    "one of the major unresolved questions in observational astrophysics is the role of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the evolution of galaxies . for over a decade the existence of smbhs in the centre of massive galaxies has been established ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , but the impact they have on their host galaxies is still hotly debated . in the local universe relations between the mass of the smbh and the luminosity of the host galaxy have been discovered ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , as well as tighter relations between the smbh mass and velocity dispersion , and hence mass , of the hosting bulge or spheroid ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 , marconi & hunt 2003 , haring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "these relationships indicate a causal link between galaxies and the smbhs that reside within them",
    ". however , the nature of this interdependence and its origin remain open issues in the field .",
    "a classic crucial question is : which evolves first , the host galaxy or its smbh ?",
    "this fundamental ` chicken and egg ' question can be resolved by measuring the masses of smbhs at higher redshifts and investigating whether they follow the local @xmath6 relationship , and if not , quantifying how they differ from it .",
    "smbhs are thought to be a near ubiquitous component of massive galaxies ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2003 , barger et al . 2005 ) although the exact fraction of massive galaxies that contain smbhs is still unknown , especially at higher redshifts .",
    "one probe of the evolution of smbhs is to look at the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) and examine how it evolves with redshift ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 , hasinger et al .",
    "2005 , barger et al .",
    "2005 , aird et al .",
    "these studies demonstrate that there is a steep positive evolution of the xlf with redshift out to z @xmath10 1.2 , followed by a less steep decline with redshift thereafter at even higher z. studies disagree on whether there is evolution in the fundamental shape of the xlf , but all agree that there is evolution in the x - ray luminosity density with redshift . as such",
    ", smbhs are known to be dynamic objects , subject to effects from the evolution of their host galaxies . in",
    "order to probe the evolution of agn over cosmic time one must be careful to compare populations that are fundamentally linked .",
    "with xlf studies one considers a range of x - ray luminosities and quantifies the evolution within this range , often ignoring the characteristics of the underlying host galaxy population . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our sample of agn to those with optical - nir detected host galaxies with well determined redshifts and stellar masses , allowing us to link objects at different redshifts for comparison via the stellar masses of their host galaxies .    measuring the mass of a smbh , however , is not trivial .",
    "often the most robust methods involve a virial mass estimation technique ( see e.g. mclure & dunlop 2002 ) , whereby one acquires detailed spectroscopy of the central most region of a galaxy and use the assumption of a virialised system to estimate the smbh mass from the broadening of spectral lines .",
    "the mass contained within a radius @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 can be deduced directly from the fwhm ( full width half maximum ) of any broad line emission ( most commonly @xmath18 ) .",
    "more challengingly , the radius at which the broad line emitting region resides must be known in this method .",
    "this can be deduced from the time delay between line emission from the accretion disc and re - emission from the broad line emitting region , in orbit around the disc .",
    "thus , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the time delay .",
    "this is only possible to measure in nearby systems with any accuracy , due to the high resolution required in this method .",
    "fortuitously , an empirical relationship has been demonstrated to exist ( e.g. mclure & jarvis 2002 , willott , mclure & jarvis 2003 , woo et al . 2008 ) between the monochrome luminosity of the 3000 @xmath21 line and the radius of the broad line emitting region .",
    "nonetheless , even this method requires good spatial resolution , and a bright ( most often quasar ) source for anything but the most local agn ( active galactic nuclei ) .    in order to estimate the smbh mass of a distant seyfert - luminosity active galaxy ,",
    "one may employ eddington arguments by setting the outward radiative force equal to the inward force of gravity .",
    "essentially this method gives a minimum value to the black hole mass given the luminosity of its accretion disc ( see e.g. alexander et al .",
    "essentially @xmath22 , with @xmath5 being a constant term related to the efficiency of the smbh . in the local universe , at z @xmath0 0.2 , @xmath23 ( see e.g. marconi et al .",
    "2009 ) , implying that the average smbh in the local universe is accreting matter at @xmath10 5 % of the eddington maximum .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disc may be calculated by employing a measured x - ray specific luminosity and utilising a spectral energy distribution .",
    "naturally , these eddington based methods are less reliable for calculating the mass of the central black hole because they contain an efficiency degeneracy .",
    "therefore , one can trace the evolution of the black hole mass only with assumptions about the evolution of the efficiency and vice versa . however ,",
    "for representative agn at intermediate to high redshifts ( z @xmath24 1 ) the eddington method is often the only method for calculating smbh masses for more than a few galaxies as it does not depend on obtaining very high resolution spectroscopy which frequently can not be obtained , especially for lower luminosity agn .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the eddington limiting ( minimum smbh ) mass for 508 x - ray active galaxies with known stellar masses and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts , taken from the goods and extended growth strip fields .",
    "we utilise deep x - ray data from the chandra x - ray observatory ( hereafter chandra ) and optical to near infrared data from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos and acs cameras , the palomar observatory and a host of other ground based observatories , including the cfht , vlt and keck observatories .",
    "we construct from this data set a volume limited sample of 85 ` seyfert ' galaxies with specific hard band luminosities @xmath25 and host galaxy stellar masses in the range @xmath26 ( selected to be not point like ) , where we are complete to z = 3 .",
    "we use this sample to probe the evolution of the @xmath6 relationship with redshift , and to compute the total active fraction ( at bright ` seyfert ' luminosities ) of massive galaxies over the past 11.5 billion years .",
    "this paper is structured as follows :  2 outlines the sources of our data and measures of photometric redshifts and stellar masses , ",
    "3 outlines the major sources of random and systematic error or biases affecting this work , and what we have done to parameterise and minimise their effects .",
    " 4 outlines our methods , including explanation of how we deduce lower limits to black hole masses . ",
    "5 presents our results in detail , as well as presenting a novel method for calculating agn lifetimes . ",
    "6 encompasses a discussion of our results , with  7 summarising our conclusions . throughout the paper we assume a @xmath27cdm cosmology with : h@xmath28 = 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath29 = 0.3 , @xmath30 = 0.7 , and adopt ab magnitude units .",
    "we utilise near - infrared and optical data from the goods acs and nicmos galaxy surveys ( acs , dickinson et al . 2003 ; gns , conselice et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) , the palomar observatory wide - field infra - red ( powir ) galaxy survey ( conselice et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , and davis et al . 2007 ) , and complementary surveys based in the goods field and extended growth strip ( egs ) .",
    "additionally , we compare these observations to x - ray catalogs from the chandra deep field north / south ( cdf - n / s , alexander et al . ( 2003 ) , luo et al . 2008 ) , and the aegis - x survey ( laird et al . 2009 ) . in so doing we construct two samples : an ` agn ' sample where we are not complete ( with all nir galaxy - x - ray source matches within a 1.5@xmath31 radius for hard band x - ray luminosities @xmath32 erg s@xmath4 in galaxies with stellar masses @xmath33 ; and a volume limited sample of ` seyfert ' galaxies ( defined to be not - point - like agn with hard band x - ray luminosities @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 in host galaxies with sellar masses @xmath2 ) where we achieve completion to z = 1.5 in the egs field and z = 3 in the gns fields .",
    "in general we use the first , and larger , sample to probe intrinsic agn properties , and the volume limited sample to probe the redshift co - evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies in the ` seyfert ' luminosity regime .",
    "we utilise the powir survey in the egs field to obtain redshifts and stellar masses for a large sample of galaxies and , after matching with chandra data , our sample of agn hosts out to redshifts of z = 1.5 .",
    "the powir survey obtained deep k and j band imaging over @xmath10 1.52 deg@xmath34 in the egs ( see fig . 1 for an illustration ) .",
    "limiting magnitudes reached in the k band are typically 22.5 - 23 ( 5 @xmath17 ) over the entire area . in total @xmath10 20,000 galaxies",
    "were imaged between z = 0.4 and z = 2 .",

    "we utilise both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the galaxies we study in both the egs and gns fields .",

    "deep2 spectroscopy was acquired through this magnitude limit , with no strong colour cuts applied to the selection .",
    "about 10,000 redshifts are measured for galaxies within the egs .",
    "the sampling rate for galaxies that meet the selection criteria is 60% .",
    "this deimos spectroscopy was obtained using the 1200 line / mm grating , with a resolution r @xmath38 covering the wavelength range 6500 - 9100  .",
    "redshifts were measured through an automatic method comparing templates to data , and we only utilise those redshifts measured when two or more lines were identified , providing very secure measurements . roughly 70% of all targeted objects result in secure redshifts .",

    ", photometric redshifts are based on the optical + near infrared imaging , in the brijk bands , and are fit in two ways , depending on the brightness of a galaxy in the optical . for galaxies that meet the spectroscopic criteria , @xmath37 , we utilise a neural network photometric redshift technique to take advantage of the vast number of secure redshifts with similar photometric data .",
    "most of the @xmath37 sources not targeted for spectroscopy should be within our redshift range of interest , at @xmath39 .",

    "the large range in possible values for t@xmath97 are indicative of a great deal of uncertainty in the field .",
    "this is in part because robust estimates of the qso lifetime , t@xmath97 , are often dependent on the eddington fraction , @xmath5 , which to determine directly requires independent measures of the smbh mass to the agn x - ray luminosity , which frequently proves extremely difficult to achieve for all but the most local active galaxies .",
    "measurements of the probable range of lifetimes allowable from the data for lower luminosity agn , such as seyfert galaxies , have also been estimated .",
    "constraints on these measures give t@xmath98 @xmath10 10@xmath99 - 10@xmath100 yrs , perhaps shorter than their brighter qso counterparts . in this section",
    "we aim to expand this prior work on agn lifetimes to more modest x - ray luminosities , looking specifically at ` seyfert ' luminosity galaxies over a wide range of redshifts .",

    "measured value of @xmath69 for each smbh we calculate the maximum time ( @xmath101 ) that a smbh can remain accreting at its current rate before it lies above the local relation , by assuming that it is accreting with an eddington fraction @xmath5 = 1 .",
    "values of @xmath5 less than this will lead to shorter timescales as this will imply that the actual smbh mass is closer to the local limit .",
    "further , we also assume that any increase in mass of the host galaxy ( i.e. through major mergers ) will result in proportional growth of the central smbh through corresponding black hole merging .",
    "thus we can write for the maximum time :    @xmath102    @xmath103    where @xmath74 is the accretion rate of the smbh , m@xmath91 ( z=0 ) @xmath104 m@xmath59 / 1000 ( from the local @xmath6 relation of haring & rix 2004 ) , which is the smbh s expected mass from the value of its host galaxy s mass at z = 0 , m@xmath91 ( z = z ) is the measured minimum black hole mass at each redshift ( z ) where @xmath5 = 1 , m@xmath59 is the stellar mass of the host galaxy , and m@xmath65 is the eddington minimum mass .",

    "this constant represents the minimum correction to the lifetime of agn considering the smbh s current minimum mass and actual accretion rate .",
    "effectively , the ratio @xmath106 is the minimum physically allowable time to construct a black hole of a given mass .",

    "6 it is apparent that hard x - ray sources fall systematically below their softer counterparts in units of @xmath69 .",

    "an additional trend may also be noted whereby the harder sources tend to be more biased towards the high stellar mass end of these plots , in the lower two redshift ranges . in the highest redshift range selection effects conspire to lead us to detect predominantly hard x - ray sources and to our measure of hardness being skewed to harder sources generally . to test this we compare the hardness of x - ray sources with the stellar mass of their host galaxies for our lower redshift points .",

    "therefore , we prefer to interpret our results as evolution with redshift of the eddington ratio , @xmath5 , further implying that the available fuel for smbhs declines over cosmic time , which is explicable within the current paradigm of galaxy evolution . as galaxies evolve",
    "they experience feedback from agn and sne which both remove the availability of cold gas , and furthermore merging and environmental effects may also contribute to this reduction in cool gas content of galaxies .",
    "as such , older galaxies have less available fuel at their centres for their smbhs and , hence , they accrete at lower fractions ( @xmath5 ) of the eddington maximum .",
    "one other possibility is that the evolution is @xmath5 is dramatic , and thus the local @xmath6 relationship evolves such that smbhs were _ less _ massive than expected for their host galaxies masses .",
    "we can quantify this maximum positive evolution in the @xmath162 ratio as being @xmath10 a factor of 10 , by setting @xmath5 = 1 , its maximum limit assuming sub - eddington accretion .",
    "thus , we conclude that either smbhs evolve more or less in proportion to their host galaxies , or else there is dramatic evolution in @xmath5 leading to smbhs growing later in mass than their host galaxies , through accretion of cool gas .    by way of comparison to the body of literature on the subject of possible evolution in the @xmath6 relationship with redshift , it is pertinent to note that a wide variety of methods and luminosity ranges have been used and studied , leading to a quite diverse set of conclusions .",
    "for example , borys et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that scuba galaxies have smbhs which are systematically lower than expected from the local relation for their stellar mass by up to a factor of 50 or so ( via eddington methods ) , and alexander et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also deduce that for smgs ( sub millimetre galaxies ) smbhs are also smaller than expected for their host galaxy s mass by a smaller factor of 3 or so ( via virial methods ) .",
    "however , jahnke et al . (",
    "2009 ) find that type-1 agn galaxies from the cosmos survey fit closely onto the local @xmath6 slope of haring & rix ( 2004 ) out to z @xmath10 2 .",
    "conversely , recent studies by merloni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and declari et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) using virial estimators of smbh masses in qso s both conclude that there is evolution in the local @xmath6 relation with redshift such that @xmath7 was lower at high z , by up to a factor of 7 ( declari et al .",
    "2010 ) or 3 ( merloni et al 2010 ) by z = 3 .",
    "our results are for lower luminosity agn , principally bright seyferts , than the majority of studies discussed above , and we rule out positive evolution in the @xmath7 ratio of greater than a factor of 2 , but we do not particularly well constrain evolution to higher values ( noting that this must be less than a factor of @xmath10 10 ) . despite the inconsistency in luminosity",
    "ranges probed and methods used for deducing smbh masses , there is very broad agreement between all of these approaches that the local @xmath6 relationship is not departed from by more than roughly one order of magnitude ( or a factor of 10 ) in either direction by z = 3 .",
    "our study particularly favours a close adherence to the local relationship of haring & rix ( 2004 ) for bright seyfert galaxies out to z = 3 , providing there is not drastic positive evolution in the eddington ratio , @xmath5 , with redshift .",
    "if this type of drastic increase in @xmath5 does occur then we are forced to conclude that smbhs in seyfert galaxies form their mass after their host galaxies , in apparent contradiction to the results for qso s in merloni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and declari et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) , but in accord with the conclusions based on studying smgs in borys et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and alexander et al .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that the most natural conclusion from our results is that smbhs and their host galaxies evolve principally together , in proportion to one another , preserving the local relation out to z = 3 , in agreement with jahnke et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , as this would require only mild and plausible evolution in @xmath5 with redshift .      we observe that the fraction of agn above our luminosity threshold ( @xmath55 @xmath24 2.35 @xmath11 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 ) rises with redshift , and that the true fraction , calculated via considering the maximum amount of time a given agn can continue accreting at its current rate before surpassing the local relation , also rises with redshift .",
    "this result reflects the rising mean eddington ratio with redshift , assuming the validity of the local @xmath6 relation at all redshifts .",
    "together this may all be interpreted as agn activity in the universe rising with redshift , and possibly levelling out at z @xmath10 1.5 - 3 where there is an optimum synergy between the mass of smbhs and available fuel at the centre of each galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with conclusions based on probing the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) , in e.g. ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , barger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , hasinger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and aird et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who all find a similar rise and then peak in x - ray luminosity within a similar redshift range .    we have constructed a novel method for estimating the maximum lifetimes of seyfert luminosity agn . using the timescales calculated from considering the maximum accretion permitted before a given agn will rise above the local @xmath6 relation , we have calculated the total fraction of @xmath2 galaxies which will be active , with @xmath55 @xmath24 2.35 @xmath11",

    "we find that at least 40% of all massive galaxies will reach seyfert level luminosities from accretion onto their central smbhs .",
    "perhaps all massive galaxies will undergo an active period in their evolution since z = 3 , but currently we can only be sure that at least a significant fraction will obtain this level of x - ray activity .    moreover , we have computed the energy density due to seyfert luminosity agn residing within massive galaxies in the universe as @xmath145 = 1.0 + /-",
    "2.5 @xmath11 10@xmath12 erg mpc@xmath13 gyr@xmath4 , noting that this corresponds to an average massive galaxy producing at least a factor of @xmath10 35 times its binding energy in agn emission .",

    "in fact in fig .",
    "10 we compare the total x - ray luminosity density in the universe at various redshifts ( found in aird et al .",
    "2009 ) to the contribution provided by sub - qso massive seyfert luminosity galaxies ( this paper ) , finding that the majority of the x - ray luminosity density of the universe is provided by this population at all redshifts up to z = 3 .",
    "it has been known for some time that the energy outpourings of agn will be greater than the binding energy of their host galaxies ( see e.g. silk & rees 1998 , fabian et al .",
    "1999 ) , but in this paper we have constrained this empirically per galaxy , as opposed to per agn .",
    "we now know that not only will active galaxies have a greater energy output by their agn than their total binding energy by some large factor ( up to 100 fold according to fabian et al .",
    "1999 ) , but that the energy released by agn ( even primarily in the seyfert regime ) is at least 35 times greater than the binding energy of all massive ( @xmath2 ) galaxies in the universe .",
    "however , it is clear that the crucial question still to be answered is , what fraction of this energy couples to the galaxy ?",
    "what we measure is the energy that escapes the galaxy to be later detected by us , whereas what matters for considerations of agn feedback on star formation is what magnitude of energy couples to the galaxy itself through radiative or momentum driven processes . to improve these minima ,",
    "apply them to average mass galaxies , and develop a deeper understanding of the coupling of agn emissions to galaxy evolution , we shall have to wait for next generation x - ray telescopes and surveys , as well as the jwst .",
    "in this paper we have detected 508 x - ray selected agn at 0.4 @xmath0 z @xmath0 6 across the egs and goods north and south fields , using the criteria set out in  3.1 .",
    "we have constructed a volume limited sample of 85 galaxies with @xmath55 @xmath24 2.35 @xmath11 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 and m@xmath59 @xmath24 10@xmath60 m@xmath61 at 0.4 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3 , with which we probe the co - evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies over the past 11.5 billion years .",
    "we adopt an eddington limit method to obtain minimum mass estimates for the smbhs residing at the centre of these active galaxies and compare these values to stellar masses of the host galaxies as a function of redshift ( see  a for data table ) .",
    "we find an active fraction of 1.2 + /-",
    "0.2 % at 0.4 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1 , which rises to 6.0 + /-",
    "0.8 % at 1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.5 , with a further modest rise to 7.4 + /-",
    "2.0 % at 1.5 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3 .",
    "we probe the @xmath161 relation across three redshift ranges ( see fig .",
    "6 ) and find that this relation appears in general lower in value , and less steep , than the local @xmath6 relation .",
    "we interpret these differences as lying with our inability to detect low mass host galaxies accreting with small values of @xmath5 and , further , interpret the offset between the local @xmath6 relation and our measured @xmath161 relation as an evolution in @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we measure the fraction of high accreting smbhs , accreting with @xmath5 @xmath24 0.1 ( assuming the local relation s validity at z @xmath24 0 ) , to rise from @xmath10 17% at z = 0.6 to @xmath10 22% at z @xmath10 2.5 ( representing a 3@xmath17 evolution ) .",
    "we calculate accretion rates for our sample of agn and plot the results of this in fig .",
    "we find that there is a high degree of scatter in the accretion rate across all redshifts and stellar masses .",
    "nonetheless , we identify a population of galaxies with very high accretion rates which are only found in high stellar mass galaxies .",
    "moreover , we find that higher mass host galaxies contain higher accreting agn to a 3@xmath17 significance .",
    "this is to be expected because more massive galaxies are predicted to contain more massive smbhs which may accrete at a higher rate .",
    "further , we calculate maximum timescales at which agn in our sample can continue to accrete at their current rate , noting that many of these timescales are quite short , with maximum values @xmath10 a few 100 myrs , and an expectation value of @xmath111 @xmath10 0.9 gyr . from this",
    "we calculate the true corrected fraction of ` seyfert ' luminosity agn in each redshift range , observing that it also rises with redshift .",
    "perhaps our largest contribution in this paper is computing a minimum fraction of galaxies at @xmath2 that will contain ` seyfert ' luminosity agn at some point over the past 11.5 gyrs ( since z = 3 ) .",
    "we find that at least @xmath10 40% of all massive galaxies",
    "will at some point during their evolution between z = 3 to the present be active with @xmath55 @xmath24 2.35 @xmath11 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "we also compute the x - ray luminosity density evolution due to massive galaxies , with seyfert luminosities and brighter , from our sample of agn , finding a close agreement with the latest estimates of the total x - ray luminosity density evolution from distinct x - ray luminosity based methods ( e.g. aird et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the x - ray luminosity function is generated by massive sub - qso galaxies .",
    "moreover , we use this total active fraction at ` seyfert ' luminosities to compute the average energy output due to agn per galaxy , and note that this is at least 35 times greater than the binding energy of an average massive galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with several previous studies in the literature ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 , fabian 1999 ) .",
    "we extend this prior work quoting this minima empirically and for each massive galaxy in the universe , as opposed to each agn . the impact of this much energy being released into the galaxies , as well as into the surrounding large scale environments , might have a profound influence on galaxies formation and evolution through agn feedback .",
    "but a crucial question remains : how much of this energy couples to the host galaxy through radiative or momentum driven processes , actually causing the feedback on star formation ?    in conclusion",
    ", we have provided evidence for the necessity of redshift evolution in @xmath5 to account for our data trends : @xmath5 must evolve with redshift to higher values , indicating that galaxies at higher redshifts were more rich in the cold gas used as fuel by the smbh .",
    "furthermore , we note an increase in the agn fraction with redshift which is also indicative of overall agn activity rising with redshift , as seen previously in many studies of the evolution of the x - ray luminosity function ( e.g. barger et al . 2005 , hasinger et al . 2005 ) . thus , there is a rise in agn luminosity out to z @xmath10 1.5 - 2 , with a possible levelling off thereafter to z = 3 , driven perhaps by an optimal balancing of available fuel and mass of smbhs .",
    "our results are consistent with no change in the local @xmath6 relation , providing there is modest and plausible evolution with redshift in @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we place a maximum limit on possible evolution in the @xmath7 ratio of less than a factor of two to lower values , and less than a factor of ten to higher values , for massive galaxy ` seyferts ' luminosity agn . therefore , we suggest that smbh masses and their host galaxy stellar masses evolve together , in direct proportion to one another , or else there is a dramatic increase in the eddington ratio with redshift and , thus , smbh masses are built up after their host galaxies .",
