    "clusters of galaxies are special environments in which to study the evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) because these massive structures contain a hot , diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) that is detectable in the x - ray .",
    "the disturbed appearance of extended radio emission from individual cluster galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 1265 in the perseus cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was the first indication that an icm existed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and early x - ray observations detected it at t@xmath1010@xmath12 k ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . with the high - resolution of the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , it was found that the radio - lobes of nearby agn in the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) appear to be coincident with cavities in x - ray surface brightness ( e.g. , perseus cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical connection suggested by this spatial coincidence allows an indirect measurement of the kinetic power produced by these agn .",
    "the connection between agn and galaxy evolution is not well - understood , but theoretical results suggest that the absence of extremely massive galaxies is due to the truncation of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "agn have been implicated as the mechanism to  shut - off \" star - formation by heating the surrounding gas and/or ejecting the gas reservoirs necessary for galaxy growth during outburst episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "heating by agn has also been suggested to account for anomalies in the scaling relationship between cluster x - ray luminosity and temperature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "particularly in low - mass clusters ( i.e. , clusters with low x - ray temperatures ) , an  entropy \" floor is observed ; @xcite suggest that preheating of the icm is required to explain this feature",
    ". this entropy floor may be due to the heat injection by agn in these clusters over time .",
    "in general the x - ray surface brightness of a cluster icm is well - fit by a @xmath13-model , which is similar to a king profile .",
    "however , some clusters display a strong peak of x - ray emission at their centers . assuming that thermal bremsstrahlung is the dominant cooling process in cluster cores , the cooling time for the x - ray emitting gas is shorter than the hubble time in these  cool - core clusters \" .",
    "therefore , prodigious amounts of star formation ( @xmath1100  m@xmath14/year ) are expected ; however , spectroscopic x - ray observations fail to detect line emission from this gas at kt@xmath81  kev @xcite , nor do optical observations reveal significant amounts of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of strong evidence for wide - spread star formation in cluster cores suggests that a source of heat is preventing the icm from cooling in cluster cores .",
    "agn are likely contributors to  feedback \" processes that are required to prevent this large - scale cooling .",
    "the connection between agn and their surrounding environments , both small and large , proves to be a difficult problem to simulate .",
    "many cosmological simulations are large volume boxes in which computational efficiency is balanced by the need to resolve small structures , such as galaxies , and to track cluster scale - properties that are several orders of magnitudes larger than galaxies .",
    "thus , in practice , some cosmological simulations inject a pre - determined amount of  heat \" at the centers of evolving clusters to simulate pre - heating of the cluster cores .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the plasma - filled lobes created by the agn in cluster bcgs can recreate the observed x - ray structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and halt the formation of strong cool - core clusters ; however , these simulations in general can not efficiently distribute the heat throughout the cluster core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one potential solution to this difficulty is that more than just the one agn in the bcg contribute to heating the icm .",
    "previous studies have found statistical excesses of radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and x - ray point sources , or xpss , in the vicinity of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the higher surface density of agn in and around clusters brings up some interesting questions : ( 1 ) is the enhanced surface density simply a direct result of a higher density of galaxies ? ( 2 ) are cluster agn triggered into activity as they pass through the dense cluster cores ? ( 3 ) is the cluster environment especially suited in some specific way to create agn activity ?",
    "radio galaxies and xpss are clearly associated with agn activity at the core of their host galaxies . in order to consistently study cluster agn , observations obtained in at least three wavelength regimes",
    "are required to detect these objects and to understand the energy feedback processes between them and the surrounding icm .    in @xcite , hereafter paper i",
    ", we examined the cluster radio galaxy and xps population in eleven  clusters . within 1 mpc from the cluster center",
    ", we detected 20 radio galaxies at and 8 xpss at @xmath1 , all spectroscopically - confirmed as cluster members with host galaxies at l@xmath1l@xmath7 .",
    "these cluster sources are hosted by cluster  red sequence \" ( crs ) ellipticals , but are more centrally concentrated than the crs galaxies as a whole .",
    "the cluster xpss in our low-@xmath9 cluster sample show little evidence for obscuration based both on their optical colors , which are consistent with the crs , and also on the absence of significant obscuration in the x - ray .",
    "based on the optical and x - ray properties of these cluster xpss , we suggested that these sources are most similar to low - luminosity , high - energy peaked bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects .",
    "based on the extrapolations of the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of radio galaxies and the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of bl lacs to lower radio and x - ray luminosities , we estimate that almost all crs galaxies are radio - loud at p@xmath0@xmath110@xmath15  and x - ray - loud at @xmath110@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , most crs galaxies possess agn jets which can deposit heat into the icm as they move through the inner cluster regions .",
    "paper i concluded that the radio - loud crs population between 10@xmath15@xmath8p@xmath0@xmath810@xmath17  can inject @xmath1855% of the total energy to the icm if we assume a shallow scaling law of agn jet power to radio luminosity , namely p@xmath19 l@xmath20 from @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite extended the @xcite sample to lower - power radio galaxies and measured a steeper slope for this scaling relationship ( p@xmath21 l@xmath22 ) , which decreases the estimated heat input by low - luminosity agn to 30% . in paper",

    "in particular , agn feedback is difficult to simulate in large - scale cosmological simulations because of the unknown range of agn powers and duty cycles , energy transport mechanisms through the icm , and feedback processes within the host galaxies themselves and their surrounding environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "although lacking a redshift , we have counted this object as a cluster radio galaxy in  [ sec : p2_rg ] .",
    "based upon a limited number of examples , the 7 spectroscopically - confirmed crs xpss appear similar in optical morphology and colors to their low-@xmath9 counterparts , suggesting that they are a similar agn population to what we found in paper i.",
    "based on our results from  [ sec : p2_rlf ] , we clearly detect evolution in the radio galaxy population in coma cluster progenitors from @xmath9@xmath101.1 to @xmath9@xmath100.2 . in paper",
    "i , we measured an raf of 2.5@xmath110.8% for the cluster radio sources and it is 3.8@xmath111.2% in our combined high-@xmath9 sample . referring to the right panel of figure  [ fig : p2_rlf_hist ] , the radio powers of the bcgs at  are also larger than the bcgs at .",
    "cluster radio sources are still hosted by crs galaxies and @xmath1875% of these radio sources are located within 500 kpc of the cluster core . at , the cluster radio galaxies remain more centrally concentrated than the crs galaxies , similar to our results from paper i. but , at , cluster radio galaxies do not appear as centrally concentrated , even though their percentage within 500 kpc is similar to those at low-@xmath9 and mid-@xmath9 .    in paper",
    "i , we used the scaling relationship between agn jet power and radio luminosity ( p@xmath81 @xmath82 l@xmath20 ) from @xcite to estimate that low - luminosity radio galaxies at @xmath121.4  contribute @xmath1855% of the total heat input to the icm .",
    "recently @xcite extended the @xcite radio galaxy sample to lower radio power ( l@xmath0@xmath610@xmath83 10@xmath84 ) and measured a steeper slope of 0.7 for this scaling relationship . with this steeper scaling relationship",
    ", we estimate that low - luminosity radio galaxies at @xmath121.4  contribute @xmath1830% of the total heat input to the icm , somewhat smaller than our previous estimate .",
    "we now use the updated @xcite scaling relationship , p@xmath81 @xmath82",
    "l@xmath22 , to estimate the increased jet power per cluster from the enhanced population of fr iis at 25.0@xmath8@xmath827.0  in our combined high-@xmath9 sample . no radio sources at @xmath125.0  were detected in our low-@xmath9 cluster sample from paper i. using figure  [ fig : p2_rlf_ledlow ] , the total integrated radio power per cluster is 3.4@xmath210@xmath42  at  and 8.9@xmath210@xmath69  at , approximately 26@xmath2 higher than the integrated luminosity in coma cluster progenitors at .",
    "this increase in radio power per cluster corresponds to a 910 fold increase in the integrated jet power and thus more heat is predicted to be available for deposition into the surrounding icm by these radio jets .",
    "figure  [ fig : p2_rxj1716_fr2 ] shows an excellent example of a high-@xmath9 ( @xmath9@xmath85.8 ) cluster from our sample in which three luminous radio galaxies are found , including in the bcg .",
    "however , the most luminous by - far is well - offset from the cluster center and so can provide significant icm heating which is both off - center and mobile with respect to the intra - cluster gas . a large majority ( 75% ) of cluster radio galaxies at @xmath9@xmath60.4",
    "are located within 500 kpc , so the additional sources of heating , at higher radio powers , will be concentrated in the inner icm regions as well .    the impact of cluster xpss on the heating of the icm is more difficult to assess due to the spectroscopic incompleteness of our sample , but is likely much less than the radio galaxy population .",
    "both this paper and @xcite find a marked increase in the x - ray active fraction in higher redshift clusters , comparable to the increase in the radio galaxy active fractions .",
    "the increase we have found is in the crs agn population close to the cluster core , which we have ascribed to low luminosity bl lac objects and thus to quite weak radio jets .",
    "@xcite find this increase predominantly in seyfert - like agn which are much further from the cluster center , near r@xmath79 ( although these authors do identify a few absorption line agn close to the cluster centers as well ) .",
    "the heat input provided by seyfert - like ( i.e. , radio - quiet ) agn is not well - known or measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but any heat they provide would be well outside the dense icm region .",
    "therefore , the radio galaxies provide the bulk of the icm heat input and so the analysis outlined above provides strong evidence for a greatly increased heat input to higher-@xmath9 cluster icm gas .",
    "but , based on the current work and @xcite , there is still much work to be done to better characterize the icm heat input , including a more complete census of the absorption and emission - line agn in high-@xmath9 clusters and their radial distribution relative to the icm .",
    "theoretical work which models the heat input by non - central , moving agn sources embedded in an evolving , less dense icm are needed to assess the efficiency of such input as a function of redshift .",
    "as a companion paper to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) , we have presented an extensive investigation of the multiwavelength nature of agn in a sample of 22 clusters of galaxies at 0.2@xmath8@xmath9@xmath81.2 , specifically chosen to be most similar to coma cluster progenitors at those redshifts . using the x - ray temperature of the icm as a proxy for cluster mass",
    ", we chose massive clusters ( or high x - ray temperature clusters ) at lower redshifts and less massive clusters ( or lower x - ray temperature clusters ) at higher redshifts to investigate the x - ray point source ( xps ) and radio galaxy populations . in both wavelength regimes ,",
    "the limiting luminosities were chosen to sample only the agn populations in l@xmath1l@xmath7 galaxies .    within 1 mpc of the cluster center , we detect 19 radio galaxies at  in our  clusters ( 11 of which are spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members and 8 of which are likely cluster members because they have colors similar to the cluster red sequence ( crs ) .",
    "because 8 crs agn do not have confirming spectroscopic redshifts , we conservatively reduce the total number of radio galaxies in this sample by 2 to 17 based upon the foreground / background agn contamination we found within the bounds of the crs in paper i. similarly , we detect 7 spectroscopically - confirmed cluster xpss .",
    "both the x - ray and radio agn have host galaxies with colors consistent with crs galaxies .",
    "there is some evidence that the radio galaxies become more centrally concentrated in these clusters at lower redshift . among the radio galaxies we have found a clear fr  ii morphology source at @xmath9@xmath100.8 with p@xmath0@xmath107.7@xmath210@xmath70 , while no fr  iis were detected at p@xmath0@xmath610@xmath69  in our low-@xmath9 sample .",
    "in addition to this one luminous fr - ii , we detect several other radio galaxies at p@xmath0@xmath610@xmath69  in our @xmath9@xmath60.4 clusters , including several bcgs .",
    "these sources are all more powerful than any we found at low-@xmath9 .    while previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has discovered clusters of galaxies around clear fr  ii morphology and power level sources at @xmath9@xmath60.4 , here we started with rich clusters at those redshifts and have discovered an fr  ii .",
    "therefore , there is no doubt that the morphology and power level of some cluster radio galaxies is changing between @xmath9@xmath101 and 0 .",
    "specifically , this study provides further support for a phenomenological model in which the power levels of subsequent outbursts of radio galaxies in clusters diminishes rapidly between these redshifts @xcite , the same range of redshifts over which the icm density and temperature dramatically increase ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "evidence presented herein and in paper i that radio galaxies are more centrally concentrated in their clusters than the crs elliptical galaxy population as a whole is further evidence for a link between agn activity and icm density ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that this agn / icm relationship may provide the necessary negative feedback mechanism to prevent runaway cooling in cluster cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison between the rlf of our  radio sources versus those in our sample reveals a larger number of high - power sources at earlier epochs , evidence for positive evolution of these sources in coma cluster progenitors .",
    "a comparison between the rlf of our  cluster radio sources to local ( z@xmath80.09 ) abell cluster radio sources shows that the two populations are similar , suggesting little evolution between  and @xmath9@xmath100 .",
    "the clear density and luminosity evolution of radio galaxies found in our sample of cluster agn is quite different from the absence of evolution found by @xcite using a flux - limited sample of emss clusters .",
    "we interpret this lack of agreement as support for our novel , physically - based method for selecting clusters for study , the `` road to coma '' concept presented in the  [ sec : p2_rtc ] .",
    "we suggest that both agn evolution results are correct and that @xcite failed to find cluster agn evolution because their high-@xmath9 sample has very similar icm properties to the low-@xmath9 sample of @xcite , to which they compared agn populations .",
    "for example , the hot , @xmath9@xmath100.8 cluster , ms 1045 - 03 ( see figure  [ fig : cluster_sim ] ) is a member of the @xcite high-@xmath9 sample and has a similar radio galaxy population to many @xmath9@xmath100 rich abell clusters .",
    "our sample was selected to avoid that pitfall and we conclude that sample selection is as critical for cluster galaxy and agn studies as it is for other evolutionary investigations",
    ".    we can be far less definitive concerning the evolution of cluster x - ray agn due to the large number of xpss in our high-@xmath9 cluster fields and to the absence of redshift information for most of them . however , there are sufficient redshifts ( 7 ) for crs xpss to show that the passive , absorption - line agn population that was identified in paper i persists at high-@xmath9 .",
    "although the statistics are quite sparse , a substantial increase in either the density and/or the luminosity of this agn class ( at least an order of magnitude increase in active fraction at @xmath15@xmath210@xmath5 when compared to low-@xmath9 ) is very similar to the rapid increase recently found in the cluster x - ray agn population by @xcite .",
    "however , our study is more complementary to this previous study than confirming because different agn classes are involved .",
    "optical spectroscopy , primarily derived from the sexsi study , and deep ground - based and hst imaging for our crs xpss finds that these passive agn are hosted in rather normal , giant elliptical galaxies positioned rather close to the cluster core , whereas the @xcite agn are largely emission - line galaxies similar to seyferts found further out in the clusters near r@xmath79 .",
    "since the energy and mass outflow from seyferts ( i.e. , radio - quiet agn population ) is still not well - measured @xcite , it is not known whether these agn contribute significantly to icm heating or not .",
    "paper i identified the crs xpss as low - luminosity bl lac objects , suggesting that they possess relativistic jets . but the absence of radio emission from these sources suggest that these jets are too weak to inject much heat into the icm ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "however , these crs x - ray agn are worthy of further study since deep x - ray imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) finds that a substantial fraction ( @xmath1820% ) of the faint xps population is due to passive agn like these cluster sources .",
    "so their detailed nature and cosmological evolution is of considerable interest .",
    "using the recent scaling law between agn jet power and the radio luminosity suggested by @xcite , p@xmath81 @xmath82 l@xmath22 , we determine that the excess power from luminous radio galaxies at 23@xmath8@xmath827  is @xmath1826@xmath2 higher in  clusters than in  clusters , which corresponds to 910 fold increase in the agn jet power if fr  ii jets have similar kinetic energies to fr  i jets .",
    "using the more shallow scaling between agn jet power and the radio luminosity from @xcite corresponds to a 56 fold increase .",
    "therefore , a larger amount of heat can be deposited into the icm at high-@xmath9 .",
    "the results presented herein and by previous studies of agn in high-@xmath9 clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) invites new theoretical work on the co - evolution of agn and the cluster icm and its effect on icm heating and cooling .",
