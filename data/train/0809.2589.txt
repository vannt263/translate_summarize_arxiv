    "casimir and related effects , where quantum effects depend upon the existence of boundary conditions for a quantum field , have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "many different points of view and approaches to this kind of problem have been followed , under quite different sets of assumptions regarding the system ; i.e. , its intrinsic properties , and the conditions under which one wants to evaluate the casimir force .    in particular , there has been much interest in studying the casimir effect at a finite temperature ( @xmath3 ) , a study that can be undertaken at different levels , distinguished by the way of taking into account all the possible @xmath3 effects .",
    "one could , for example , include thermal effects in the description of the matter on the mirrors ( a very active research topic  @xcite ) , or rather for the physical description of the vacuum field  @xcite , or for both .    in this article , we shall assume perfect ( at any temperature ) mirrors , with thermal effects restricted to the vacuum field .",
    "it has been noted that thermal and casimir - like effects share some similarities ; this should hardly be surprising , since both may be regarded , essentially , as finite - size effects , the former in the euclidean time interval @xmath4 $ ] ( with periodicity / antiperiodicity conditions ) , and the latter for a spacial coordinate with dirichlet or neumann conditions .    even though the nature of the boundary conditions is different , it should be expected that , when both effects are present , interesting relations ( ` dualities ' ) will arise between the dependence on the inverse temperaure @xmath5 and the distance between the mirrors .    in this article , we present an approach to the calculation of the casimir free energy for a scalar field at finite temperature in @xmath0 dimensions , subject to dirichlet boundary conditions , including self - interactions .",
    "this approach is based on the use of a path - integral formulation , whereby the @xmath0-dimensional problem is mapped to a dimensionally reduced one , with fields living on the boundaries .",
    "for all the cases considered we analyze the high and low temperature expansions , computing also perturbative corrections to the casimir free energy due to the non - interacting fields .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we present our approach , introducing conventions and definitions . in section",
    "[ sec : scalarfree ] we deal with the calculations and the corresponding results for a free real scalar field .",
    "interactions are introduced in  [ sec : scalarint ] and , in  [ sec : concl ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the main object we shall be interested in is the free energy @xmath6 for a real scalar field @xmath7 in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions , which is subject to dirichlet boundary conditions on two plane mirrors , separated by a distance @xmath2 along the direction corresponding to the @xmath8 coordinate .    in terms of the corresponding partition function @xmath9 ,",

    "accordingly , we use a coordinate system such that , if the euclidean coordinates are denoted by ( @xmath18 ) , the mirrors then correspond to the regions : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and will be parametrized as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    ", we assume that the ( @xmath1-dependent ) factor that comes from the integration over the canonical momentum has been absorbed into the definition of @xmath26 , so that performing the integral over @xmath7 does indeed reproduce the partition function ( without any missing factors ) .",
    "following  @xcite , the functional @xmath24-functions are exponentiated by means of two auxiliary fields , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , living in @xmath29 spacetime dimensions : @xmath30 where we introduced the singular current : @xmath31 whose support is the region occupied by the mirrors .",
    "since we shall treat interactions in a perturbative approach , it is convenient to deal first with the free theory , as a necessary starting point to include the interactions afterwards .",
    "when the theory is free ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 , and the integral over @xmath7 becomes gaussian .",
    "the resulting partition function , denoted by @xmath34 is then : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ( free ) partition function in the absence of the mirrors , and : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the free , imaginary - time , propagator .",
    "it may be written explicitly as follows : @xmath41 with .",
    "we have used the notation , and denotes the matsubara frequencies .",
    "@xmath40 is the inverse , in the space of @xmath42-periodic functions , of @xmath43 .",
    "expression ( [ eq : zint1 ] ) allows one to extract from the free energy the term that would correspond to a free field in the absence of mirrors , @xmath44 , plus another contribution , which we shall denote by @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xmath47 \\;,\\ ] ] which clearly contains the casimir effect information ( including thermal corrections ) .",
    "however , it also carries information that is usually unwanted , associated to the ever - present self - energy of the mirrors .",
    "indeed , we see that it includes a divergent contribution to the free energy , which can be neatly identified , for example , by noting that , when @xmath48 : @xmath49 ^ 2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the contribution corresponding to one mirror : @xmath51 we then identify @xmath52\\ ] ] as the free energy term that measures a mirror s self - interaction .",
    "it is , of course , independent of @xmath2 . extracting also this contribution",
    ", we have the following decomposition for @xmath44 @xmath53 where @xmath54 has a vanishing limit when .",
    "we can produce a more explicit expression for the interesting term @xmath55 , starting from its defining properties above .",

    ". then , to absorbe this divergence we shall rather consider the corresponding free energy _",
    ", obtained by dividing the extensive quantity by @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , @xmath67\\ ] ] where @xmath68 on the right hand side is evaluated for a system with a finite parallel volume .",
    "moreover , taking advantage of the translation invariance along the parallel coordinates , we may use a fourier transformation to write : @xmath69 where @xmath70 with : @xmath71^{-1 }      \\,{\\widetilde\\omega}_{12}^{(n)}({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel ) \\ ,      [ { \\widetilde\\omega}_{22}^{(n)}({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel ) ] ^{-1 } \\ ,      { \\widetilde\\omega}_{21}^{(n)}({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel ) \\;.\\ ] ] where the tilde denotes fourier transformation in both @xmath42 and @xmath72 . note the appearance of the reciprocals of the matrix elements of @xmath73 ( not to be confused with the matrix elements of the inverse of that matrix ) .",
    "the explicit form of the objects entering in ( [ eq : deft ] ) may be obtained from ( [ eq : omega ] ) : @xmath74 so that : @xmath75    it is then evident that the sum and the integral in ( [ eq : denercas ] ) converge , since the integrand falls off exponentially for large values of the momenta / indices .",
    "this behaviour should be expected , since we have constructed this object subtracting explicitly the would - be self - energy parts , the possible source of uv divergences .",
    "thus , the main result of the previous calculations is a ( finite ) expression for the free energy , which can be written as follows : @xmath76 \\;.\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the expression above has been obtained subtracting the free energy corresponding to a situation where the mirrors are separated by an infinite distance ; on the other hand , we note that , when the @xmath77 limit is taken , the sum is replaced by an integral , and we obtain : @xmath78 which is the casimir energy per unit area .    with this in mind , one may introduce yet another quantity ; the _ temperature dependent _ part of the free energy , whose area density we will denote by @xmath79 , and , from the discussion above , it is given by : @xmath80 by using a rather simple rescaling it the integral in the second term , we may write : @xmath81 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty   d\\nu \\ , \\ln\\big [ 1 \\,-\\ ,   e^ { - \\frac{2 a}{\\beta } \\sqrt{(2 \\pi \\nu)^2 + ( \\beta { \\mathcal e}({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel))^2}}\\big ] \\big\\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields the casimir free energy as a difference between a series and an integral , although the for the thermal part , since the sum over energy modes has already been ( implicitly ) performed .    before evaluating the free energy for different numbers of spacetime dimensions , we explore below some consequences of a duality between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .      the dual role played by @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the free energy",
    "may be understood , for example , by attempting to calculate that object by following an alternative approach , based on the knowledge of the exact energies of the field modes , emerging from the existence of dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the energies @xmath82 of the stationary modes are : @xmath83    since each one of these modes behaves as a harmonic oscillator degree of freedom , its free energy @xmath84 $ ] has the following form : @xmath85&= &       -\\frac{1}{\\beta } \\,\\ln \\big [ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty       e^{-\\beta w_l({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel ) ( n+\\frac{1}{2 } ) } \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\frac{1}{2 } w_l({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel )   + \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\ ,       \\ln \\big [ 1 \\ , - \\ ,   e^{-\\beta w_l({\\mathbf k}_\\parallel ) } \\big]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we consider @xmath79 , the _ temperature dependent _ part of the free energy density , obtained by summing the second term in the expression above over all the degrees of freedom , and dividing by the parallel area : @xmath86 \\;.\\ ] ] this may also be written as follows : @xmath87 \\nonumber\\\\        & - & \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\ , \\int \\frac{d^{d-1}{\\mathbf k}_\\parallel}{(2\\pi)^{d-1 } }",

    "then we may write : @xmath88 or : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an @xmath2-independent object , which corresponds to the free energy of a free field .",
    "thus , if we are going to be concerned with temperature and @xmath2-dependent quantities , for example , to study the temperature dependence of the casimir force , we only need derivatives with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the expression above , and we see that : @xmath91      \\,=\\,\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\beta   \\partial a }       \\big [ { \\mathcal f}_t^{(0)}(\\beta , a ) \\big]\\;,\\ ] ] or : @xmath92 where the tildes denote subtraction of any term which has a vanishing mixed second partial derivative .    on the other hand , from the explicit form of the free energy density as sum over modes ( matsubara or casimir ) , we find the identity : @xmath93 ( 2 a , \\beta/2 ) \\,=\\ ,   \\big [ \\beta \\widetilde{\\mathcal f}_c^{(0)}\\big ] ( \\beta , a ) \\;,\\ ] ] which , combined with ( [ eq : aux1 ] ) yields a duality between @xmath2 and @xmath1 : @xmath94 to proceed , we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath95 , and transform variables in the integral over @xmath96 to have a dimensionless integral , obtaining @xmath97 where @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is a constant factor that depends solely on the dimension @xmath29 .    now , using the duality formula ( @xmath102 ) , we obtain the an interesting relation involving @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) .",
    "note that this relation has immediate relevance to relate the low and high temperature regimes .",
    "indeed , writing the expression above more explicitly , we see that : @xmath107    this duality relation had been pointed out , for the @xmath108 case , by balian and duplantier  @xcite . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we apply the previous results and study some particular properties of the free energy corresponding the the free scalar field , firstly for the @xmath109 case , which we single out since it can be exactly solved , and then for @xmath110 .",
    "the free energy ( neglecting an irrelevant constant ) is given by the expression : @xmath111 which may be written as an infinite product : @xmath112 where @xmath113 , and @xmath114 < 1 for @xmath3 .",
    "using standard properties of ellipthic functions , we get a more explicit results for the free energy : @xmath115,\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is dedekind s eta function .",
    "although it has been obtained for @xmath3 , one can verify that it also yields the proper results for , namely , .    besides , the @xmath117-function satisfies the property : which , in this context , is tantamount to the duality relation .",
    "now , we exploit the duality relation to extract the high and low temperature behavior of the casimir energy , for @xmath118 . in a high temperature expansion , formula ( @xmath119 ) can be expanded for small @xmath120 .",
    "the infinite - temperature limit corresponds to @xmath121 , thus @xmath122 yields the leading contribution in this expansion , with the @xmath123 terms producing higher - order corrections .",
    "the explicit form of the leading high temperature term is : @xmath124 whereas aplying the duality formula ( [ eq : duality ] ) @xmath125 , we have the first order contribution in the low temperature regime , @xmath126 which is @xmath2 independent . the sub - leading contributions ( @xmath127 ) include more involved integrals ; nevertheless , when @xmath108 and @xmath121 , it reduces to terms like @xmath128 .",

    "let us now consider the theory that results from turning on the quartic self - interaction term , studying the corresponding corrections to the free energy .",
    "this can be done in ( at least ) two different ways .",
    "we shall consider first the would - be more straightforward approach , which amounts to expanding the interaction term in powers of the coupling constant first , postponing the integration over the scalar field until the end of the calculation .",
    "we call it ` perturbative ' since it is closer in spirit to standard perturbation theory",

    "it is quite straightforward to check that the propagator above does verify the dirichlet boundary conditions , when each one of its arguments approaches a mirror .",

    "the thermal correlation function @xmath153 above is composed of two contributions : one is the usual free thermal propagator in the absence of boundary conditions and the other come from reflexions on the surface boundaries . in this way",
    "we write @xmath154 where @xmath155 is given by : @xmath156 with @xmath157 equal to : @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "we apply now the previous approach to the calculation of the first - order correction to the free energy ( in fact , to the force ) and the self - energy function :      we want to evaluate thermal corrections to casimir energy in the interacting theory , in particular , to understand how its divergences should be dealt with . to automatically subtract @xmath2-independent contributions , we work with the derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , this is a force , and it has the same amount of information as an energy which has been subtracted to avoid @xmath2-independent infinities .",

    "we have derived two different approaches . in the first approach , perturbative expansion has been used to obtain the first order corrections to thermal casimir force , showing that it is finite once the standar renormalization of thermal field theory in the absence of mirrors is performed .    on the other hand",
    ", we also studied the selfenergies , showing that they have surface divergences in their coordinate dependence , and that those divergences are of a polynomial type , with a degree which depends on the dimension .",
    "finally , we have shown that a variation in the order used to integrate the auxiliary fields yields a different method , whereby the one particle irreducible functions naturally appear .",
