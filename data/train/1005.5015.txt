    "type - ii superconductors under the action of a transport current and a longitudinal magnetic field may exhibit the counter intuitive phenomenon of negative resistance within a certain set of experimental conditions .",
    "this property , together with other intriguing phenomena , such as the observation of paramagnetic moments , and the _ compression _ of the transport current by the action of a parallel magnetic field , have been reported in the course of intense experimental and theoretical activities.@xcite most of these works were primarily concerned with the arrangement of the macroscopic current density @xmath0 along the so - called nearly _ force free _ trajectories . recall that if @xmath0 is _ nearly parallel _ to the magnetic induction @xmath1 , moderate or weak pinning forces are needed for avoiding the detrimental flux - flow losses related to the drift of flux tubes driven by the magnetostatic force ( @xmath2 per unit volume ) .",
    "more specifically , negative voltages have been observed by different groups@xcite when recording the current - voltage characteristics at specific locations on the surface of the sample ( central region ) .",
    "in addition , the striking effect takes place within a definite interval of applied magnetic fields .    within such a complex scenario ,",
    "it was recognized early on that the observations could only be understood if new dissipation mechanisms , additional to the flux flow phenomena were considered . in particular , a prominent role happens to be played by the flux - line cutting ( crossing and recombination ) between adjacent tilted vortices.@xcite nevertheless , certain facts still remain to be fully understood .",
    "thus , the challenging problem of inhomogeneous electric fields , even changing sign along the specimen surface is hitherto open . on the other hand , important issues as the consideration of irreversible effects related to the thresholds for flux depinning and",
    "cutting phenomena have not been reported yet . in this contribution , we investigate the influence of such mechanisms on the establishment of critical negative current structures within the superconducting state .",
    "this is to be considered as a step forward for gaining knowledge on the processes that operate just previous to the dissipation regime .",
    "within such a physical scenario , the concentration of transport current towards the center of the sample and the appearance of negative flow at the surface will be predicted for a certain range of experimental conditions . to be specific ,",
    "the application of different components of magnetic field , their sequence and characteristic values will be identified as relevant issues for the observation of negative currents .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec.[seccs ] we put forward the basic ideas about the theoretical approach used , that is a general critical state theory for type - ii superconductors .",
    "an idealized slab geometry arrangement is proposed , aimed to introduce the lowest level of complexity for our purposes .",
    "then , in sec.[secanalytic ] we perform a simplified analytical evaluation that allows to capture the main underlying physical matters . in sec.[secnumeric ] a quasi-3d statement of the problem is solved by numerical means .",
    "this is needed for the consideration of inhomogeneities over the sample .",
    "a discussion about the scope of our investigation within the problem of negative currents is given in sec.[secdisc ]",
    "the fundamental concept on which the critical state theory relies is that , in many cases , the experimental conditions allow to analyze the evolution of the system in the quasistationary regime .",
    "thus , ampere s law becomes @xmath3 , and determines the distribution of supercurrents within the sample .",
    "when some external excitation ( magnetic field and/or transport current ) applies , the quasistationary evolution between successive equilibrium states is ruled by faraday s law @xmath4 . here",
    "the induced transient electric field is determined through an appropriate material relation @xmath5 , and is used to update the profile of @xmath6 .",
    "the material law encodes the mechanisms related to the breakdown of magnetostatic equilibrium , as well as the dissipation modes operating in the transient from one state to the other . in this sense ,",
    "there have been a number of theoretical proposals , and among them ( see refs . and the citations therein ) , here we choose the so - called _ double critical state model _ ( dcsm).@xcite this approach allows a straightforward connection between the mesoscopic flux depinning and cutting phenomena , and the field equations for the coarse grained quantity @xmath6 . on the one hand , the model establishes the critical conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 that relate to ( i ) the maximum pinning force on the vortex lines ( @xmath9 ) and ( ii ) to the maximum variation of the tilt angle between vortices ( notice that from eq.([eq : ampere ] ) one has @xmath10).@xcite on the other hand , as it was thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    ", the model also provides a rule that fixes the _ trajectory _ of the system through the dissipation excursion towards the new equilibrium state .",
    "thus , corresponding to a very sharp transition from the superconducting state to some regime of high losses , one can argue that the final state current density verifies a maximum projection law relative to the transient electric field , i.e. : @xmath11 that ensures the fastest return to equilibrium .",
    "notice that , in 1d situations ( infinite slab with a single component applied magnetic field ) this is trivially verified because by symmetry one has @xmath12 and both perpendicular to @xmath1 . in other words , one has @xmath13 with @xmath14 standing for the component of @xmath15 along the direction @xmath16 . in more general configurations ,",
    "the maximum projection condition is not so simple due to the vectorial character of the problem .",
    "thus , within the dcsm framework , the current density must transit from one state to another that fulfill the conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this may be expressed by a relation of the kind @xmath17 with @xmath18 having a rectangular section of size @xmath19 in this case . in summary , the critical state model in general 3d systems",
    "is posed by the system of equations @xmath20 notice that , as equilibrium magnetization is usually neglected in the critical state regime , @xmath21 is used .",
    "the integration of the above system of equations supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions may be cumbersome , so that an alternative formulation has been frequently used , that is fully equivalent , and states the problem in a variational form .",
    "it is briefly explained in the forthcoming paragraphs .      from the mathematical point of view , the above problem is equivalent to the incremental minimization of the functional ( field lagrangian ) @xmath22 \\equiv",
    "\\int_{\\ir ^3}\\left[\\frac{\\mu_0}{2}(\\delta{\\bf h})^2 + { \\bf p}\\cdot(\\nabla \\times { \\bf h } -{\\bf j})\\right]d^{3}{\\bf r } \\ , .\\ ] ]    here , one introduces the variable @xmath23 as a _",
    "lagrange multiplier _ for enforcing ampre s law . @xmath24 , on the other hand , represents the magnetic field increment for the time step under consideration .",
    "additionally , the algebraic condition @xmath25 should be fulfilled in the minimization .",
    "notice that the euler  lagrange equations for this variational problem are    @xmath26    that identify @xmath27 . from the mathematical point of view , here @xmath6 is no longer a variable , but plays the role of a parameter to be adjusted in a direct algebraic minimization , i.e. : @xmath28    as one can see , both ampere and faraday s laws are included in the variational formulation , as well as any domain @xmath18 for the critical current material law .",
    "technically , we emphasize that the shorter is the path step , the better agreement with the standard maxwell equation formulation . on the other hand , numerical methods for discrete constrained minimization",
    "can be used as an alternative to the integration methods for maxwell s equations , that happends to be very convenient for dealing with 3d problems .",
    "a further advantage of the methodology introduced above is that the constraint relation @xmath17 allows a pictorial representation that provides a useful tool for the understanding of the current flow structures that arise in the longitudinal configurations .",
    "notice , that in our case ( dcsm conditions ) @xmath18 may be depicted by the cylindrical region in fig.[fig_1 ] .    regarding the specific details about the mathematical technique for obtaining the numerical solution of eq.([eq : minprin ] )",
    ", the interested reader is addressed to our ref .. there , we analyzed a number of situations that are easily translated to the study within this work .",
    "here , we will just mention that our proposal consists of transforming the volume integral over the whole space in ( [ eq : minprin ] ) , into a double integration over the sample s volume .",
    "then , upon discretization , one solves for the distribution of current in a proper set of circuits , under the corresponding constraints for the components of @xmath0 parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "thus , when one chooses the infinite slab geometry depicted in fig.[fig_1 ] , such circuits are naturally defined by a collection of current layers within the @xmath29-plane , and each carrying a current density given by @xmath30 $ ] , with @xmath31 the position of the layer . notice that , owing to the planar translational symmetry , a @xmath32-component of @xmath0 may be ruled out .",

    "this configuration allows to clearly determine the mechanisms related to the negative currents . as a main fact",
    "it will be established that , when building the parallel configuration , the response of the superconductor depends on the limitations for the current density established by the depinning threshold @xmath37 , on the orientation of the local magnetic field , and eventually on the flux cutting restriction @xmath40 .",
    "this is easily understood at a qualitative level just by glancing at fig.[fig_1 ] .",
    "the critical current restriction is given by the region @xmath41 that is the intersection between the cylinder @xmath18 and the @xmath29-plane , where the current flows .",
    "for moderate values of the angle @xmath39 between the local magnetic field and the @xmath32-axis , @xmath41 is an ellipse of semi - axes @xmath37 and @xmath42 with    @xmath43    an increase of the in - plane magnetic field component will result in a tilt of the cylinder , by an increase of the angle @xmath39 .",
    "note in particular that , initially , the maximum value of the in - plane parallel current density , @xmath42 , grows with the angle @xmath39 , independent of @xmath40 ( which is , thus , absent from the theory ) until the maximum value @xmath44 is reached .",
    "then , the ellipse is truncated and eventually would be practically a rectangle of size @xmath45 when @xmath46 .",
    "outstandingly , for large values of @xmath47 ( long cylinders ) , the critical current along the parallel axis , @xmath42 increases more and more as the weight of @xmath33 decreases and , furthermore , this quantity is always beyond the individual values @xmath37 and @xmath40",
    "here , we show that some of the experimental features that will be obtained later on , from numerical calculations , may be already predicted by a simplified analytical model .",
    "let us consider the excitation process depicted in fig.[fig_1 ] for the particular case @xmath48 ( the region @xmath41 is a rectangle with axes defined by the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath49 ) .",

    ", one can show that such expressions may be transformed into the polar form @xmath51 with @xmath52 the modulus of the magnetic field vector , and @xmath53 the angle between such vector and the @xmath54-axis .",
    "now , the thresholds of flux depinning and cutting imply the in - plane conditions @xmath55 it is apparent that , in general , eq.([eq : ampere ] ) and the conditions in eq.([eq : critical ] ) would not straightforwardly lead to the solution of the problem .",
    "typically , one should also use faraday s law , either by explicit introduction of the related electric fields ( as in ref . ) , or by our variational statement .",
    "nevertheless , in this case ( @xmath56 ) , the resolution noticeably simplifies .",
    "in fact , for the situation considered , we will have a combination of the cases @xmath57 and @xmath58 and integration of eq.([eq : ampere ] ) is straightforward .",
    "for further mathematical ease , we will also consider @xmath40 and @xmath37 to be field independent constants in this work .",

    "we will refer to different zones within the sample that are , in brief , macroscopic regions where well defined dissipation mechanisms occur . inserting our normalized units",
    ", there can be t zones , where only flux depinning ( transport ) occurs ( @xmath63 ) , c zones , where only flux cutting occurs ( @xmath64 ) , and ct zones where both transport and cutting occur ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "finally , one will have o zones where neither flux transport nor cutting take place ( @xmath66 ) . introducing these possibilities in eqs.([eq : ampere ] ) and ( [ eq : critical ] ) one gets the following cases for the incremental behavior of the magnetic field in polar components @xmath67 and all that remains for obtaining the penetration profiles is to solve successively ( integrate ) for @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the corresponding boundary conditions ( evolutionary surface values @xmath70 ) .",

    "nevertheless , they are related by ampre s law ( eq.([eq : amperexy ] ) ) as one can easily check at qualitative level , i.e. : in the slab geometry @xmath119 is the slope of @xmath120 respectively .",
    "recall that negative values for the transport current density @xmath121 are neither obtained for the t or ct states when @xmath115 is high ( @xmath122 ) until extreme values of the longitudinal field ( @xmath123 ) are reached . on the contrary",

    "the @xmath126 structure becomes rather inhomogeneous as @xmath82 increases and takes the form of a highly positive layer in the center _ shielded _ by a prominent negative region .",
    "when @xmath125 is bounded ( ct states ) one observes a negative layer at the surface that eventually disappears when @xmath82 increases more and more ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "some fine structure details are also to be noticed : ( i ) for the magnetic process under consideration , the _ partial penetration regime _ in which the flux free core progressively shrinks to zero ( curves labelled @xmath128 ) is practically independent of the critical current model ( region ) used , ( ii ) the peaked structure of @xmath129 for the t - states at @xmath124 ( curves labelled @xmath130 ) is accompanied by a similar behavior in @xmath131 that relates to a subtle magnetic field reentry phenomenon in @xmath132 as outlined in the plot , ( iii ) the negative values of @xmath126 are obtained for smaller and smaller @xmath82 as @xmath115 also decreases .",

    "this will occur at the central region of the sample s lateral surface , where end effects are minimal .",

    "<S> the longitudinal transport problem ( current is applied parallel to some bias magnetic field ) in type - ii superconductors is analyzed theoretically . based on analytical results for simplified configurations and relying on numerical studies for general scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that a remarkable inversion of the current flow in a surface layer may be predicted under a wide set of experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> strongly inhomogeneous current density profiles , characterized by _ enhanced _ transport towards the center and reduced or even negative values at the periphery of the conductor are expected when the physical mechanisms of flux depinning and consumption ( via line cutting ) are recalled . a number of striking collateral effects such as local and global paramagnetic behavior are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> our geometrical description of the macroscopic material laws allows a pictorial interpretation of the physical phenomena underlying the transport backflow . </S>"
