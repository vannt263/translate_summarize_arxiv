    "with the advent of modern accurate nucleon - nucleon interactions and modern many - body computational schemes , nuclear structure calculations starting from the nucleonic degrees of freedom have become possible in the recent years .",
    "a major advancement has been the systematic construction of realistic nucleon - nucleon potential using chiral effective field theories which start from the most general lagrangian , consistent with the symmetries of qcd and the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , appropriate for low energy nucleons and pions ( ref.[1]-[4 ] ) .",
    "using these nucleon - nucleon interactions and sometimes even the three nucleon interaction derived from chiral effective field theory several nuclear structure calculations have been performed ( ref . [",
    "5]-[8 ] ] ) .",
    "typically these calculations are limited to light nuclei ( @xmath3 ) and in some cases , to closed shell medium mass nuclei ( ref.[8 ] ) .",
    "the nuclear structure methods mostly used are the no core shell model ( ref.[9]-[12 ] ) which pioneered ab - initio nuclear structure calculations , the coupled cluster method ( ref.[13]-[15 ] ) , the hyperspherical harmonics method ( ref.[16][17 ] ) and , to a lesser extent , the hybrid multideterminant method ( hmd ) ( ref .",
    "[ 18]-[20 ] ) .",
    "the no core shell model method is limited by the size of the hilbert space which become gigantic as the particle number is increased and is used for @xmath3 .",
    "the coupled - cluster method is used typically at or around shell closure , but it has been applied also to medium mass nuclei ( ref . [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the hyperspherical harmonics method has been used for very light systems .",
    "the hmd method , which is utilized in this work , is not limited by the size of the hilbert space as it can be easily used for medium mass nuclei , and it is equally applicable to closed and open shell nuclei ( ref . [ 21 ] ) . using realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "so far it has been used only in few cases .",
    "it is our goal to systematically apply this method to nuclei in several mass regions .",
    "this method belongs to the same family of the vampir methods ( ref.[22]-[24 ] ) , except that the hmd uses a linear combination of particle slater determinants instead of quasi - particle slater determinants as in the vampir methods .",
    "it is similar to the quantum monte carlo method ( ref.[25]-[27 ] ) , except that the variational method is not stochastic .",
    "it utilzes quasi - newtonian methods ( ref.[28 ] ) , and the slater determinants are parametrized differently . in this work",
    "we take the n3lo nucleon - nucleon interaction ( ref.[4]),and study the carbon isotopes , both even and odd , and evaluate ground state energies and few excited states for all isotopes under study . because of the large amount of calculations involved , especially for the odd isotopes , we limit ourselves to few harmonic oscillator frequencies , and renormalize the interaction up to 4 , and in some cases up to 5 , harmonic oscillator shells using the lee - suzuki ( ref.[28]-[31 ] ) renormalization procedure . in an ab - initio approach ,",
    "one considers several harmonic oscillator frequencies and an increasing number of harmonic oscillator major shells until the results are independent from the frequency and the number of major shells . in practice , at least for this chain of isotopes , this has never been done so far .",
    "such an approach would be necessary if both accurate binding energies and excitation energy are required .",
    "here we focus mostly on excitation energies and energy differences for which convergence is faster .",
    "some carbon isotopes have been considered in the framework of the umoa renormalization prescription and shell model diagonalization ( ref . [ 32 ] ) with a truncation in the number of allowed excitations .",
    "more recently they have been been considered in ref.[33 ] , although the renormalization method is applied in momentum space ( with a sharp cutoff at @xmath4 ) rather than in the harmonic oscillator space .",
    "moreover an inert @xmath5 has been assumed and the neutron single - particle space is restricted to the @xmath6 shell .",
    "in contrast , we use a no core approach up to the @xmath7 shell included , and in some case up to @xmath8 shell , with the effective interaction constructed for this space .",
    "the heaviest of the carbon isotopes @xmath9 has been recently found to be a borromean nucleus ( ref.[34 ] ) , that is , stable for particle emission although @xmath10 is particle unstable .",
    "all calculations discussed in this work have been performed using personal computers , two quad - core and four dual - core processors .",
    "the outline of this work is the following . in section 2",
    "we give a brief recap of the hmd method . in section 3 and subsections",
    "we discuss the results and compare with the experimental data . in section 4 we summarize the results .",
    "the hmd method ( ref.[18]-[20 ] ) consists in solving the many - body schrodinger equation using as ansazt for the yrast eigenstates @xmath11 a linear combination of slater determinants , i.e. @xmath12 the operator @xmath13 restores the desired exact quantum numbers ( angular momentum and parity ) , @xmath14 labels the slater determinants and @xmath15 is a general slater determinant ( that is , no symmetries are imposed ) .",
    "each slater determinant is built from the generalized creation operators @xmath16 @xmath17 is the creation operator in the harmonic oscillator single - particle state @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the dimension of the single - particle basis .",
    "the complex numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 are determined by minimizing the expectation values of the hamiltonian with quasi - newtonian methods ( cf . ref .",
    "[ 28],[35 ] and references in there ) .",
    "clearly the larger the number of slater determinants @xmath22 the more @xmath11 will approach the exact yrast eigenstate .",
    "the ansatz of eq.(1 ) is valid for yrast eigenstates , for excited eigenstates having the same quantum numbers we must in addition add terms containing the lower eigenstates with the same quantum numbers and the linear combination must preserve orthogonality with the previously determined eigenstates ( ref.[23 ] ) .",
    "the degree of accuracy of the ansatz of eq.(1 ) for finite @xmath22 has been recently analized in ref .",
    "[ 36 ] in order to construct extrapolation techniques , using the phenomenological @xmath23 realistic effective interaction .",
    "we have tested the accuracy and effectiveness of our quasi - newtonian variational method for @xmath24 . using @xmath25 angular momentum projected slater determinants we obtained for the ground state energy @xmath26 and with @xmath27 slater determinants we obtained @xmath28 and using @xmath29 slater determinants @xmath30 .",
    "this is to be compared with the exact shell model value of @xmath31 quoted in ref.[36 ] , and with the quantum monte carlo result ( prior extrapolation ) of @xmath32 which was obtained with @xmath33 slater determinants ( ref .",
    "[ 36 ] ) .    in practice , for ab - initio no - core calculations , we avoid the use of the full angular momentum projector since experience shows that , in such cases , we need a rather large number of fully angular momentum and parity projected slater determinants to obtain good approximations to the eigenstates and therefore , in order to reduce the computational cost , we proceed as follows .",
    "we add to the hamiltonian a term @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular momentum operator and @xmath36 is the desired value and we use , instead of the full angular momentum projector only the projector to good projection onto the z - axis @xmath37 , much in the same way it is done in standard shell model calculations .",
    "this device is very useful especially for odd and odd - odd mass nuclei .",
    "the wave functions obtained in this way are used to evaluate observables with the full three - dimentional angular momentum projector .",
    "experience shows that few hundreds slater determinants are relatively easy to obtain and the full re - projection of the wave function obtained this way is much less expensive than the use of the full projector from the beginning .",
    "however , if we desire excited states with the same exact quantum numbers , the use of the full projector seems necessary so far .",
    "as discussed in the next section , for no - core calculations , we need several hundreds @xmath38 projected slater determinants to reach a reasonable convergence to the energies , however the convergence to the excitation energies is much faster , provided wave functions with different @xmath38 undergo exactly the same sequence of computational steps . the number of slater determinants necessary to achieve convergence increases with the number of major shells .",
    "hence for 5 major shells calculations we only evaluate excitations energies .",
    "the intrinsic hamiltonian used in the calculations is obtained in the following way .",
    "first an harmonic oscillator potential is added to the a - particle hamiltonian , the resulting hamiltonian is a - dependent .",
    "the two - body interaction is obtained by renormalizing the two - particle a - dependent hamiltonian with the lee - suzuki procedure , much in the same way it is done in the no core shell model ( cf . ref .",
    "[ 9 ] for a detailed description ) .",
    "the two - particle interaction is restricted to some number of relative coordinate harmonic oscillator shells @xmath39 .",
    "the two - body matrix elements of the intrinsic hamiltonian for the a - particle system can then be constructed . using the talmi - moshinski transformations brackets , the matrix elements of this intrinsic hamiltonian",
    "are evaluated up to @xmath40 major shells in the frame of the single - particle coordinates .",
    "this is the hmd - a version of the method ( cf .",
    "[ 20 ] for more details ) .",
    "usually , in order to prevent center of mass excitations in the evaluation of excited states a term proportional to the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian for the center of mass @xmath41 is added at the end .",
    "the variational calculation is carried out progressively .",
    "that is , we start with a single slater determinant and add trial slater determinant one at a time and always optimize the last added slater determinant . at specific numbers of slater determinants",
    "we vary anew all slater determinants one at a time .",
    "for example when @xmath42 all slater determinants are varied anew , and after we reach , say , @xmath43 we re - optimize all slater determinants etc .. the numbers @xmath44 are somewhat a free choice . by",
    "far this is the most expensive part of the calculation , especially if we consider the full angular momentum and parity projector , hence the choice to replace it with a partial projector and only after a sufficiently large number of slater determinants has been constructed , we use the full projector to evaluate expectation values .    both the method and the set of computer codes have been extensively tested .",
    "for all the cases discussed below the coefficient of the center of mass hamiltonian is fixed to @xmath45 , the harmonic oscillator frequency is for most of the cases @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath47 of the @xmath48 term is set to @xmath49 for the even - even isotopes to @xmath50 or @xmath51 for the odd - mass isotopes . in the following ,",
    "the experimental values of the binding energies are taken from ref .",
    "[ 37 ] and the excitation energies form ref .",
    "[ 38 ] . for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the experimental data is taken from ref . [ 39 ] , for @xmath54 from ref . [ 40 ] and for @xmath55 from ref .",
    "[ 41 ] . in what follows",
    "we also discuss the variation of the number of nucleons in the single particle shells and define @xmath56 where @xmath57 is any of the excited states , @xmath58 is the ground state energy , @xmath59 is any of the single - particle shells and @xmath60 denotes the type of particles ( neutrons or protons ) .",
    "only the largest variations will be given , the ones that are omitted are too small compared with the others .",
    "this is a very simple way to classify the type of excitation , e.g. neutron excitation , proton excitation or both .",
    "as previously mentioned , in some cases we have performed calculations also with 5 major shells .",
    "we find that the absolute binding energies are different from the ones obtained with 4 major shells , however the excitation energies are rather similar .",
    "this reflects the fact that energy differences converge much better than the energies .",
    "also the value of @xmath46 is close to the energy minimum as a function of @xmath61 , thereby decreasing the dependence of the energies on @xmath61 .",
    "a systematic calculation for several values of @xmath61 , for 4 and 5 major shells , for all these isotopes is too lengthy on personal computers . unless explicitely stated we consider @xmath46 and 4 major shells .",
    "the experimental binding energy of @xmath62 is @xmath63 . using @xmath64 slater determinants , optimized as explained in the previous section with @xmath65 and then re - projecting to @xmath66 , in order to evaluate the expectation values",
    ", we obtained a binding energy of @xmath67 .",
    "the behavior of the ground state energy as a function of the inverse of the number of slater determinants , @xmath68 , is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the behavior of the energies in fig . 1 is typical if the number of slater determinants is large enough .",
    "it is reasonable , due to the linear behavior of the energy as a function of @xmath69 to extrapolate in order to estimate the uncertainty of the calculation .",
    "the extrapolated value for the ground - state energy is @xmath70 , hence our result has an uncertainty of @xmath71 .",
    "we found this @xmath69 behavior in most of the cases . only in few cases",
    "the number of slater determinants was not sufficiently large .",
    "we use anyway a linear extrapolation in order to have an estimate of the uncertainty of the calculations .",
    "these uncertainties should not be confused with the statistical uncertainties as in monte carlo calculations .",
    "they are simply an estimate of the possible decrease of the energies if we would increase the number of slater determinants , that is , how far we are from the exact values .    for the light carbon isotopes",
    "we find that theoretical binding energies are underestimated compared to the experimental values , while for the heavy carbon isotopes the theoretical values overestimate the corresponding experimental values .",
    "the experimental value of the excitation energy of the @xmath72 state is @xmath73 .",
    "our calculation gives @xmath74 .",
    "in fig.2 we show the behavior of the excitation energy as a function of the number of the slater determinants .",
    "as it can be seen the value of the excitation energy is rather stable and the oscillation for large @xmath68 have an amplitude of about @xmath75 for this nucleus .",
    "the reason for this remarkable stability is that both calculations for the @xmath76 and the @xmath77 energy have almost the same error and of the same sign ( these are variational calculations ) and this error cancels out in the evaluation of the excitation energy .",
    "this is the reason why excitation energies converge much better than the absolute value of the energies .",
    "it should be stressed however that the relative uncertainty in the binding energy is small .",
    "it is interesting to look at the variation of the population of nucleons as we go from the ground - state to the excited state .",
    "we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "although small , the number of neutrons ( protons ) excited above the @xmath80 and @xmath81 shells is non - zero : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    for this nucleus",
    ", we performed also a calculation with @xmath86 with 4 major shells .",
    "the binding energy becomes @xmath87 ( compared with @xmath67 for @xmath46 ) , however the excitation energy of the @xmath72 is @xmath88 and it is well converged as a function of the number of slater determinants , and it is almost the same as the one obtained for @xmath46 , which is @xmath89 . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath72 state obtained with @xmath91 slater determinants , becomes @xmath92 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that although the energies have a non negligible @xmath61 dependence , the excitation energies are nearly constant .    using @xmath46",
    "we have also performed a calculation with 5 major shells .",
    "however we used only @xmath93 slater determinants , and obtained @xmath94 .",
    "the calculation is not entirely converged since the excitation energy has a small increase with the number of slater determinants ( about @xmath95 in the last @xmath96 slater determinants ) , but it is consistent with and it approaches the values obtained with 4 major shells .",
    "this shows that working with 4 major shells and @xmath46 , gives reliable results for the excitation energies for this nucleus .    at this point",
    "a few comments are in order about the convergence of our method .",
    "the hmd method is applicable regardless of the dimensionality of the hilbert space , however we do not know yet how many slater determinants we have to optimize in order to obtain the energies within , say @xmath97 accuracy .",
    "we do know however that larger hilbert spaces require a larger number of slater determinants .",
    "using @xmath98 major shells , we need a few hundreds slater determinants ( perhaps even @xmath99 ) , for calculations utilizing @xmath100 major shells this number is higher , hence it is not so surprising that the excitation energy for the @xmath72 state in the case of @xmath100 major shells is not entirely converged with @xmath93 slater determinants . presumably , the optimal way to calculate binding energies is to evaluate differences of binding energies and to perform an accurate binding energy calculation on just one isotope .",
    "an other possibility is to explore , in the context of ab - initio calculations , the extrapolation method of ref.[36 ] .",
    "the experimental value of the binding energy of @xmath101 is @xmath102 and the ground state has @xmath103 , which is reproduced by our calculation .",
    "the theoretical value is @xmath104 . as before for large @xmath68",
    "the energy is linear as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "and the extrapolated value is @xmath105 giving a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath97 .",
    "the energy of the first excited state ( @xmath106 ) is not well reproduced .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath50 , while our calculation gives @xmath107 .",
    "the first @xmath108 state has an experimental excitation energy of @xmath109 , our calculation gives @xmath110 .",
    "in fig.3 we show the behavior of the excitation energies as a function of the number of slater determinants . the number of neutrons ( protons ) for the ground - state in the @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 shells are @xmath111 respectively .",
    "moreover for the @xmath106 state @xmath112 @xmath113 the @xmath108 state is primarily a neutron excitation .",
    "in fact @xmath114 @xmath115      @xmath116 has been extensively investigated , both experimentally and theoretically because of its astrophysical importance . as in the no core shell model calculations the @xmath117 state ( the hoyle state ) , is missing at low energy .",
    "a small number of harmonic oscillator major shells is not sufficient to reproduce the position of this state .",
    "the experimental binding energy is @xmath118 , the calculated value with @xmath93 slater determinants is @xmath119 and the extrapolated value is @xmath120 .",
    "we performed another calculation using @xmath121 slater determinants and obtained @xmath122 and a corresponding extrapolated value of @xmath123 . in this case",
    "the @xmath69 behavior seen in the previous cases is not entirely correct .",
    "this example shows that the extrapolated values give simply an uncertainty of the calculated ones .",
    "also in this case the uncertainty is about @xmath97 .",
    "the calculated excitation energy of the @xmath72 state is @xmath124 to be compared with the experimental value of @xmath125 .",
    "the behavior of the excitation energy as a function of the number of slater determinants is show in fig .",
    "the occupation numbers for the ground state are nearly equal for neutrons and protons , and a small number of neutrons and protons is moved from the @xmath126 to the @xmath127 shell ( @xmath128 ) for the @xmath77 state .",
    "odd - mass isotopes allow to study whether the single - particle properties of the hamiltonian are correct .",
    "the experimental binding energy of @xmath129 is @xmath130 and the ground - state has @xmath131 .",
    "some low - lying yrast levels of negative parity are ( in mev ) @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "our calculation reproduces the correct @xmath131 of the ground - state with a binding energy of @xmath134 ( with @xmath64 slater determinants and an uncertainty of @xmath135 ) . for the above negative parity levels we obtained @xmath136 and @xmath137 regarding the nature of these states , we have @xmath138 @xmath139 and for the @xmath108 state @xmath140 @xmath141 these variations show that the @xmath108 is primarily a proton excitation .    the positive parity levels involve the @xmath6 shell .",
    "the experimental locations in mev are ( we consider only few yrast levels ) @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding theoretical values are @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , nearly @xmath148 too high .",
    "the variations of the occupation numbers reveal the nature of these levels .",

    "were not considered .",
    "the rather large excitation energy across major shells remains to be understood , that is , whether it is an artifact of the restriction to @xmath98 major shells , or it is a feature of this @xmath161 interaction .",
    "eventually , this nucleus will be studied in the future in a more detailed way ( i.e. a larger number of major shells and several values of @xmath61 ) .",

    "the ground state has @xmath235 and the known excited state have @xmath236 and @xmath237 for this nucleus we considered only @xmath33 slater determinants and therefore the calculated binding energy is not well determined ( we did not see in this case a linear behavior as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "the calculated binding energy is @xmath238 .",
    "more importantly the ground - state has @xmath186 in disagreement with the experimental value .",
    "although less accurate than the excitation energies in the previous cases , we have @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the experimental binding energy for @xmath53 is @xmath241 and the ground - state has @xmath186 , the first excited state has @xmath242 and the second excited state has @xmath243 .",
    "the calculated binding energy is @xmath244 with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath245 .",
    "the ground - state has @xmath235 in disagreement with the experimental value .",
    "although we have seen , in this model space , a systematic underbinding for light isotopes and overbinding for the heavy ones , it is interesting to extract the neutron separation energies and to compare them with the experimental data .",
    "this is done in fig.6 .",
    "the overall trend is rather well reproduced , especially the even - odd effect . in all these calculations the binding energies",
    "are not fully converged ,    that is , we need a larger number of slater determinants .",
    "however this does not represent a problem as previously mentioned , since these calculations are variational .",
    "in other words , the theoretical errors have all the same sign and such errors tend to cancel out in the evaluation of the separation energies .",
    "this seems to be especially true for the evaluation of the excitation energies . as a final point ,",
    "let us mention that the sizes of the hilbert spaces with @xmath98 major shells , range from @xmath246 ( in the case of @xmath62 ) to about @xmath247 in the case of @xmath9",
    "in this work we have studied carbon isotopes in a fully microscopic way using the chiral n3lo interaction properly renormalized to @xmath98 ( in some cases @xmath100 ) major shells . in this treatment",
    "there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "we have evaluated binding energies , separation energies and few low energies levels .",
    "there seems to a systematic discrepancy with the experimental data whenever energy levels involve cross - shell excitation .",
    "moreover , although by a small amount , @xmath9 is not bound .",
    "this is not very surprising since the model space is not well suited to describe loosely bound systems .",
    "the first @xmath77 state of heavy even isotopes are dominated by neutron excitation and for light odd isotopes the proper spin of the ground state is reproduced .",
