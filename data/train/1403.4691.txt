    "in this paper , we consider a sampled - data switched linear system with a memoryless quantizer in fig .",
    "[ fig : wsdsls ] .",
    "the available information to the controller is only the quantized state and switching signal at each sampling time .",
    "we then raise the questions : _ what conditions are needed for the stability of the closed - loop system under such imcomplete information ?",
    "if the system is stable , how close can the trajectories get to the origin ?",
    "_    switched systems and quantized control have been studied extensively but separately ; see , e.g. , @xcite for switched systems and @xcite for quantized control .",
    "few works examine the state behavior of a switched system with quantization and the effect of switching between sampling times .",
    "recently , @xcite has proposed an encoding and control strategy that achieves sampled - data quantized state feedback stabilization of switched systems .",
    "this strategy is rooted in the non - switched case in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the input of the controller is a discrete - valued and discrete - time signal , whereas the controller generates a continuous - valued and continuous - time output signal .",
    "in contrast , here we consider a controller whose _ output as well as input _ are _ discrete - valued _ and _ discrete - time _ signals .",
    "@xcite have studied the stability analysis of a sampled - data non - switched system of a memoryless quantizer . since a memoryless quantizer does not give an accurate value of the state near the origin , asymptotic stability can not be generally achieved .",
    "however , such a quantizer is useful because of the simplicity in implementation . @xcite",
    "have developed a sufficient condition for a non - switched system to be quadratic attractive .",
    "the authors have also provided a randomized algorithm to verify this stability property in a computationally efficient way . in the present paper ,",
    "we use this algorithm and a scheduling function with the revisitation property introduced in @xcite .",
    "the combined method constructs a common lyapunov function guaranteeing the quadratic attractiveness of each subsystem .",
    "we face two challenges in the stability analysis of the switched system in fig .",
    "[ fig : wsdsls ] .",
    "first , since only at sampling times we know which subsystem is active , we do not always use the feedback gain designed for the subsystem active at the present time .",
    "therefore the closed - loop system may become unstable when switching occurs between sampling times .",
    "second , after arriving at a certain neighborhood of the origin , the trajectory may not approach the origin anymore due to the coarseness of quantization .",
    "this implies that the trajectory can leave the desired neighborhood if switching makes the system unstable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we state the switched system and the information structure together with basic assumptions . in section  3",
    ", we first investigate the growth rate of the common lyapunov function when switching occurs in a sampling interval .",
    "next we develop a stability analysis method for the sampled - data switched system by using the _ total mismatch time _ , the total time when the modes mismatch between the plant and the controller . in section  4",
    ", we briefly discuss the relationship between the mismatch time and the dwell time of the switching signal .",
