    "the energy of the flux tube between static quark sources in 4d su(3 ) has been studied in detail @xcite : the grouping of excited states into bands and the corresponding energy gap dependence on @xmath0 at large distances is suggestive of the string picture , but there is a significant fine structure .",
    "recent studies in 3d z(2 ) , su(2 ) and compact u(1 ) @xcite confirmed a string formation at large separation with less pronounced fine structure . in the following calculations we analyse the spectrum of the qcd periodic flux tube .",
    "the torelon has no fixed colour sources and so provides a particularly favourable theoretical environment in which to observe the onset of string behaviour @xcite .",
    "on the lattice , torelons may be created using colour - singlet traces of ordered product of link matrices encircling a spatial lattice direction .",
    "excitations are obtained by projection onto longitudinal momentum @xmath1 eigenstates and onto different irreps of rotations in the plane transverse to the flux .",
    "the energy spectrum of a qcd flux tube is then estimated by monte - carlo measurement of the correlation function , @xmath2 . because the signal decreases exponentially as t",
    "is increased , it is very important to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the correlator as quickly as possible . in order to do",
    "so we choose operators for which the overlap with the lightest state is as large as possible .",
    "we use an anisotropic lattice in which the temporal spacing @xmath3 is much smaller than that in the spatial directions @xmath4 to exploit the enhanced signal - to - noise of the correlation function at smaller temporal separations .",
    "the center symmetry of the lagrangian allows us to restrict our torelon operators to be positive under charge conjugation .",
    "the lattice symmetry of rotations about the winding axis @xmath5 , is @xmath6 for @xmath7 or @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 contains rotations of @xmath11 and the reflection in the @xmath12 plane ( @xmath13-parity ) and has five irreducible representations : @xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the two - element group consisting of the identity operation and the reflection about the midpoint on the principal axis @xmath5 ( @xmath20-parity ) .",
    "states that are even / odd under @xmath20-parity are labeled by the subscripts @xmath21/@xmath22 respectively .",
    "simulations were performed on three different lattices of extent in the @xmath5 direction of 8 , 12 and 16 @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice action was symanzik improved and included a two - plaquette term , designed to reduce cut - off artefacts in the scalar glueball mass .",

    "for long qcd torelons , the two transverse oscillations of the tube are the only degrees of freedom forced to be low - lying goldstone modes .",
    "these are the degrees of freedom of an oscillating string . in @xmath27",
    "however , quantisation spoils lorentz invariance and the string picture must then be regarded as an effective theory .",
    "an important question is whether or not sufficiently long qcd torelons can be well described by an effective string theory , such as the nambu - goto string in @xmath27 , or the polchinski - strominger proposal @xcite .",
    "note that the simplest theories do not naturally include a number of effects that might also be relevant , such as rigidity terms or interactions with the qcd bulk .",
    "at lowest order in an expansion about @xmath28 , all these pictures give a common spectrum of states with energy gaps @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum numbers of some of these excitations for states up to @xmath30 are given in table [ table:1 ] .",

    "this spectrum can be computed for the nambu - goto action and a computation of the @xmath31 corrections in the polchinski - strominger scheme is also under investigation .",
    "the picture emerging from the analysis of these simple classes of effective string theories is that the fine structure is predominantly dependent on the longitudinal momentum along the string .",

    "the energy gap of all levels is qualitatively in agreement with the first order string prediction @xmath35 as shown in the last figure .",
    "the second figure shows the @xmath36 level is close to the lowest - order string prediction , although deviations are resolved .",
    "the difference between the lowest - order string model and this excitation appears to grow as l is increased .    in the @xmath37 states , significant structure",
    "is seen below 2 fm , while an extremely interesting pattern of degeneracies emerges at @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here ,",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath40 states form two degenerate clusters .",
    "this is in agreement with indications from the effective string calculations that the fine structure is dependent on @xmath1 alone .",
    "the splitting between these clusters decreases as @xmath41 increases .    at @xmath30 , for @xmath42 fm , there appears to be a single degenerate set ( notice from table .",
    "[ table:1 ] all 3 states have @xmath43 ) but a clear split between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states is found . in the continuum",
    "these two states are expected to be degenerate and tests on possible lattice artifacts are under investigation .",
    "extra operators for these states are being studied .",
