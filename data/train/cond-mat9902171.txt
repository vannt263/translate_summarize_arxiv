    "the physical vacuum is a complicated condensed matter @xcite . at the moment we know only the low - energy properties of this substance , i.e. the properties at energies much smaller than the planck energy scale , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is newton s constant .",
    "we know that at the low - energy edge our vacuum has many different symmetries : @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge symmetries , lorentz invariance , general coordinate invariance , and dicrete cpt symmetry . with increasing energy more elements of symmetry",
    "are added : @xmath5 symmetry of weak interactions , probably the gut symmetry and even supersymmetry .",
    "when the temperature dicreases such symmetries become spontaneously broken . this is the traditional point of view , which is supported by the observation of the similar symmetry breaking in different ( many - body ) condensed matter systems : superfluids , superconductors , magnets , liquid and ordinary crystals .",
    "however there is another and actually opposite point of view : all symmetries known in the universe spontaneously ( but without any phase transition ) appear at the low - energy corner@xcite . they become more and more pronounced the lower the energy .",
    "the symmetries disappear at higher energies when the planck energy is approached .",
    "this conjecture is also supported by the condensed matter analogy .    here",
    "we discuss the topological origin of such enhanced symmetry in the infrared limit .",
    "it is caused by the so - called topologically stable fermi points in the spectrum of the fermionic system .",
    "we show that if such points exist in quantum condensed matter , then at low enough temperature this system exhibits fully or partially the lorentz invariance , general covariance , and gauge invariance",
    ". moreover the collective modes which describe such a system at low @xmath6 all are represented by the chiral relativistic fermions , gauge fields , and gravity .",
    "all are the low - energy phenomena , which are absent at higher energies , where the condensed matter has only a very limited set of the global symmetries .    from the second point of view some directions in physics",
    "look artificial . in particular , since the gravity exists only as the infrared phenomenon one should not quantize gravity : only low - energy gravitons can be quantized @xcite .",
    "the same concerns the multidimensional string theories , which also give rise to gravitation in the infrared limit .",
    "the fermi point mechanism does not require a high dimensionality for the space - time : the topologically stable fermi point is just a property of the conventional 3 + 1 dimensional space - time .",
    "the fermi point is a particular case of the topologically stable manifolds of zeroes in the fermionic spectrum .",
    "let us start with the simplest such manifold  the fermi surface .",
    "the fermi surface appears in the noninteracting fermi gas , where the energy spectrum of fermions is @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the chemical potential .",
    "the fermi surface bounds the volume in the momentum space where the energy is negative , @xmath9 , and where the particle states are all occupied at @xmath10 . in this isotropic model",
    "the fermi surface is a sphere of radius @xmath11 .",
    "it is important that the fermi surface survives even if interactions between particles are introduced .",
    "such stability of fermi surface comes from the topological property of the feynman quantum mechanical propagator ",
    "the one - particle green s function @xmath12 let us write the propagator for a given momentum @xmath13 and for the imaginary frequency , @xmath14 .",
    "the imaginary frequency is introduced to avoid the conventional singularity of the propagator `` on the mass shell '' , i.e. at @xmath15 . for noninteracting particles",
    "the propagator has the form @xmath16 obviously there is still a singularity : on the 2d hypersurface @xmath17 in the 4-dimensional space @xmath18 the propagator is not well defined .",
    "this singularity is stable , i.e. can not be eliminated by small perturbations .",
    "the reason is that the phase @xmath19 of the green s funtion @xmath20 changes by @xmath21 around the path embracing this 2d hypersurface in the 4d - space ( see fig .",
    "[ fermisurfaceasvortex ] ) .",
    "the phase winding number @xmath22 can not change continuously , that is why it is robust towards any perturbation .",
    "thus the singularity of the green s funtion on the 2d - surface in the momentum space is preserved , even when interactions between particles are introduced .",
    "exactly the same topological conservation of the winding number leads to the stability of the quantized vortex in superfluids and superconductors , the only difference being that , in the case of vortices , the phase winding occurs in the real space , instead of the momentum space .",
    "the complex order parameter @xmath23 changes by @xmath24 around the path embracing vortex line in 3d space or vortex sheet in 3 + 1 space .",
    "the connection between the topology in real space and the topology in momentum space is , in fact , even deeper ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ) . if the order parameter depends on space - time , the propagator in semiclassical aproximation depends both on 4-momentum and on space - time coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "the topology in the 4 + 4 dimensional space describes : ( i ) the momentum space topology in the homogeneous system ; ( ii ) the defects of the order parameter in real space ; and ( iii ) topology of the energy spectrum within the topological defects @xcite .    in the more complicated cases ,",
    "when the green s function is the matrix with spin and band indices , the phase of the green s function becomes meaningless . in this case",
    "one should use a general analytic expression for the integer topological invariant which is responsible for the stability of the fermi surface : @xmath26 here the integral is taken over an arbitrary contour @xmath27 in the momentum space @xmath28 , which encloses the fermi hypersurface ; and @xmath29 is the trace over the spin and band indices .",
    "the topological class of systems with fermi surface is rather broad .",
    "in particular it contains the conventional landau fermi - liquid , in which the propagator preserves the pole .",
    "close to the pole the propagator is @xmath30 evidently the residue @xmath31 does not change the topological invariant for the propagator , eq.([invariantforfs ] ) , wihch remains @xmath32 .",
    "this is essential for the landau theory of an interacting fermi liquid ; it confirms the assumption that in fermi liquids the spectrum of quasiparticles at low energy is similar to that of particles in a fermi gas .",
    "it is also important for the consideration of the bosonic collective modes of the landau fermi - liquid .",
    "the interaction between the fermions can not not change the topology of the fermionic spectrum , but it produces the effective field acting on a given particle by the other moving particles .",
    "this effective field can not destroy the fermi surface owing to its topological stability , but it can locally shift the position of the fermi surface",
    ". therefore a collective motion of the particles is seen by an individual quasiparticle as a dynamical mode of the fermi surface .",
    "these bosonic oscillative modes are known as the different harmonics of the zero sound .",
    "an example is shown in the upper part of fig.[collectivemodes ] .",
    "note that the fermi hypersurface exists for any spatial dimension .",
    "in the 2 + 1 dimension the fermi hypersurface is a line  the vortex line in the 2 + 1 momentum space as is shown in fig . [",
    "fermisurfaceasvortex](a ) .      in the 1 + 1 dimension the green s function looses its pole , but nevertheless the fermi surface is still there @xcite . in 1 + 1",
    "dimension the landau fermi liquid transforms to another states within the same topological class .",
    "example is provided by the luttinger liquid .",
    "close to the fermi surface the green s function for the luttinger liquid can be approximated as ( see @xcite ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to fermi velocities of spinons and holons and @xmath36 .",
    "the above equation is not exact but reproduces the topology of the green s function in luttinger fermi liquid . if @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the singularity in the @xmath39 momentum space occurs on the fermi surface , i.e. at @xmath40 .",
    "the topological invariant in eq.([invariantfor fs ] ) remains the same @xmath32 , as for the conventional landau fermi - liquid .",
    "the difference from landau fermi liquid occurs only at real frequency @xmath41 : the quasiparticle pole is absent and one has the branch cut singularities instead of the mass shell , so that the quasiparticles are not well defined .",
    "the population of the particles has no jump on the fermi surface , but has a power - law singularity in the derivative @xcite .",
    "another example of the non - landau fermi liquid is the fermi liquid with exponential behavior of the residue @xcite .",
    "it also has the fermi surface with the same topological invariant , but the singularity at the fermi surface is exponentially weak .      in this section",
    "we do not consider the bifurcations which lead to the overall reconstruction of the particle spectrum , which occur , say , during the transition to superconducting state .",
    "we assume that the temperature , though is small compared to the `` planck '' scale @xmath42 , is still above the superfluid transition : @xmath43 . but even in the superconducting region @xmath44 the winding number for the conventional green s function is preserved : the invariant in eq.([invariantfor fs ] ) is again @xmath32 . only instead of pole at @xmath45 in the green s function of the normal state",
    ", one has zero at @xmath45 in the superconducting state : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "this demonstrates the stability of the singularity in the green s function , though the fermi surface as the manifold of zeroes in the energy spectrum disappears in the superconductor .",
    "although the systems we have discussed contain fermionic and bosonic quantum fields , this is not the relativistic quantum field theory which we need for the simulation of quantum vacuum : there is no lorentz invariance and the oscillations of the fermi surface do not resemble the gauge field even remotely .",
    "the situation is somewhat better for superfluids and superconductors with fully gapped spectra ; examples , which provide useful analogies with dirac fermions and spontaneously broken symmetry in quantum fields , are conventional superconductors @xcite and superfluid @xmath0he - b @xcite . in @xmath0he -",
    "b the hamiltonian of free bogoliubov quasiparticles is the @xmath48 matrix : @xmath49 where the pauli @xmath50 matrices @xmath51 describe the conventional spin of fermions and @xmath50 matrices @xmath52 describe the bogoliubov isospin in the particle - hole space .",
    "the bogoliubov hamiltonian asymptotically approaches the dirac one in the low @xmath53 limit .",
    "this is however is not the low energy limit , which for the typical @xmath0he - b parameters occurs for @xmath53 close to @xmath54 .",
    "the low @xmath53 and low @xmath55 limits coincide at large negative @xmath56 , which is not the case in @xmath0he - b .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath0he - b also serves as a model system for simulations of many phenomena in particle physics and cosmology including experimental verification @xcite of the kibble mechanism describing formation of cosmic strings in the early universe @xcite .    note that even for the fully gapped systems there can exist the momentum - space topological invariants , which characterize the vacuum states .",
    "typically this occurs in 2 + 1 systems , e.g. in the 2d electron system exhbiting quantum hall effect @xcite ; in thin film of @xmath0he - a ( see @xcite and sec.9 of ref.@xcite ) ; and in the 2d superconductors with broken time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the quantum ( lifshitz ) transition between the states with different topological invariants occurs through the intermediate gapless regime @xcite .",
    "now we proceed to the topological class which most fully exhibits the fundamental properties needed for a realization of the relativistic quantum fields , analogous to those in particle physics and gravity .",
    "it is the class of systems , whose representatives are superfluid",
    "@xmath0he - a and the vacuum of relativistic left - handed and right - handed chiral fermions ( another example of this class in condensed matter has been discussed for gapless semiconductors @xcite ) .",
    "this class is characterized by points in the momentum space where the ( quasi)particle energy is zero . in particle physics",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath57 is characteristic of the massless neutrino ( or any other chiral lepton or quark in the standard model ) with @xmath58 being the speed of light .",
    "the energy of a neutrino is zero at point @xmath59 in the 3d momentum space .",
    "the hamiltonian for the neutrino  the massless spin-1/2 particle  is a @xmath50 matrix @xmath60 which is expressed in terms of the pauli spin matrices @xmath61 .",
    "the sign @xmath62 is for a right - handed particle and @xmath63 for a left - handed one : the spin of the particle is oriented along or opposite to its momentum , respectively .",
    "the bogoliubov matrix for the @xmath0he - a fermions is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are real vectors , which in equilibrium or ground state are unit orthogonal vectors .",
    "the energy of the fermions @xmath67 is zero at 2 points , at @xmath68 .",
    "let us show that zeroes in the spectrum of the chiral fermions and in the spectrum of @xmath0he - a fermions are topologically stable and described by the same topological invariant .",
    "let us again consider the propagator of the particle @xmath69 on the imaginary frequency axis , @xmath14 .",
    "one can see that this propagator still has a singularity , which is now not on the surface but at the points in the 4d momentum space : @xmath70 and @xmath71 for chiral fermions and @xmath0he - a fermions respectively .",
    "an integer topological invariant which supports the stability of the point zeroes is expressed in terms of the propagator in the following way @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the 3-dimensional surface embracing the point node in the 4-momentum space .    for the chiral fermions in eq.([neutrino ] ) this invariant is @xmath74 , where the sign is determined by the chirality of the fermion .",
    "the meaning of this topological invariant can be easily visualized .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the particle spin @xmath75 as a function of its momentum @xmath13 in the 3d - space @xmath76 . for right - handed particles @xmath77 ,",
    "while for left - handed ones @xmath78 . in both cases",
    "the spin distribution in the momentum space looks like a hedgehog ( see fig .",
    "[ fermisurfaceasvortex]b ) , whose spines are represented by spins : spines point outward for the right - handed particle and inward for the left - handed one . in the 3d - space",
    "the hedgehog is topologically stable .      for the @xmath0he - a fermions in eq.([aphasefermions1 ] )",
    "@xmath79 , where the sign is determined by the position of the node , @xmath80 .",
    "the topological invariant is twice larger because of the double degeneracy of the fermi point over the conventional spin of the @xmath0he atom . for each projection of spin",
    "one has @xmath81 .",
    "note that the bogoliubov spin @xmath82 in @xmath0he - a plays the same role as the conventional spin @xmath83 of chiral fermions in eq.([neutrino ] ) .",
    "on the other hand the conventional spin of the @xmath0he atom is responsible for the degeneracy , but not for chirality , and thus plays the part of the isospin ( see also sec.[degeneracy ] ) .",
    "this means that the origin of the spin responsible for the chirality of the ( quasi)particle is fully determined by the matrix structure of the fermi point . in this sense",
    "there is no principle difference between spin and isospin : changing the matrix structure one can convert isospin to spin , while the topological charge of the fermi point remains invariant .        the high - temperature superconductors in cuprates most probably contain zeroes in their quasiparticle energy spectrum .",
    "the arpes experiments @xcite show that these are four lines in the 3d momentum space where the quasiparticle energy is zero or , equivalently , four point zeroes in the 2d cuo@xmath84 planes .",
    "the high - t superconductors thus belong to class of systems with fermi lines : the dimension @xmath85 of the manifold of zeroes is @xmath86 , which is intermediate between a fermi surface with @xmath87 and a fermi point with @xmath88 .",
    "the energy spectrum of quasiparticles near each of the 4 gap nodes can be written as @xmath89 the `` speeds '' of light @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the `` fundamental '' characteristics determined by the microscopic physics of the cuprates .",
    "this means that the system belongs to the same class as 2 + 1 qft with massless relativistic fermions .",
    "as in the other two classes of fermionic systems with the gapless quasiparticles , all low - energy ( infrared ) properties of cuprate superconductors are determined by zeroes .",
    "in particular , the density of the fermionic states is determined by the dimension of the zeroes : @xmath92 many low - temperature properties of these superconductors are obtained from a simple scaling arguments .",
    "for example , an external magnetic field @xmath93 has dimension of @xmath94 and thus of @xmath95 . at finite @xmath93 , the density of states is nonzero even at @xmath96 .",
    "substituting @xmath97 to eq.([dosgeneral ] ) one obtains @xmath98 and the following scaling law for the heat capacity : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is some function with the known asymptotes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an experimental indication of such scaling with @xmath101 was reported for yba@xmath84cu@xmath102o@xmath103 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lines of zeroes generally have no stability : there is no corresponding @xmath104 invariant , which can support the topological stability . the singular line in the momentum space from which the spines ( now the vector @xmath82 ) point outward ( see fig .",
    "[ fermisurfaceasvortex]c ) can be elmininated by the escape of the @xmath82-vector to a third dimension .",
    "this can be accomplished by an operation similar to the folding of an umbrella ( see fig .",
    "[ fermisurfaceasvortex]d ) .",
    "existence of the nodal lines can be prescribed , however , by the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "there are many nontrivial classes of superconductors , whose symmetry supports the existence of nodal lines in symmetric positions in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "the symmetry violating perturbations , such as impurities , an external magnetic field , etc .",
    ", destroy the lines of zeroes @xcite .",
    "one could expect different types of transformations of these lines of zeroes which depend on the perturbation .",
    "impurities , for example , can : ( i ) produce the gap in the fermionic spectrum @xcite ( see fig.[fermisurfaceasvortex]d ) , which corresponds to appearance of mass for the 2 + 1 relativistic fermions ; ( ii ) lead to the finite density of states @xcite , thus transforming the system to class ( 1 ) ; ( iii ) produce zeroes of fractional dimension , which means that the exponent in the density of states @xmath105 is non - integral @xcite and thus corresponds to a fractional @xmath85 of the manifold of zeroes ; and ( iv ) lead to localization @xcite .",
    "an open question is : can the quantum fluctuations do the same , in particular , can they change the effective dimension of the zeroes ?",
    "close to the fermi point @xmath106 in the 4d space one can expand the propagator in terms of the deviations from this fermi point , @xmath107 .",
    "if the fermi point is not degenerate , the general form of the propagator is @xmath108 here we returned back from the imaginary frequency axis to the real energy , so that @xmath109 instead of @xmath14 ; and @xmath110 .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath111 is given by the poles of the propagator : @xmath112 thus in the vicinity of the fermi point the massless quasiparticles are described by the lorentzian metric @xmath113 .",
    "it is most important that this is the general form of the energy spectrum in the vicinity of any fermi point , even if the underlying fermi system is not lorentz invariant ; superfluid @xmath0he - a is an example . the fermionic spectrum necessarily becomes lorentz invariant near the fermi point , _",
    "i.e._. if one applies this reasoning to our quantum vacuum , one may conclude that possibly the observed lorentz invariance of the physical laws is not a fundamental but a low - energy property of the vacuum which results from the existence of the topologically stable fermi points .",
    "let us consider the collective modes in such a system .",
    "the effective fields acting on a given particle due to interactions with other moving particles can not destroy the fermi point .",
    "that is why , under the inhomogeneous perturbation of the fermionic vacuum the general form of eqs.([generalpropagator]-[generalenergy ] ) is preserved .",
    "however the perturbations lead to a local shift in the position of the fermi point @xmath106 in momentum space and to a local change of the vierbein @xmath114 ( which in particular includes slopes of the energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ collectivemodes ] ) .",
    "this means that the low - frequency collective modes in such fermi liquids are the propagating collective oscillations of the positions of the fermi point and of the slopes at the fermi point .",
    "the former is felt by the right- or the left - handed quasiparticles as the dynamical gauge ( electromagnetic ) field , because the main effect of the electromagnetic field @xmath115 is just the dynamical change in the position of zero in the energy spectrum : in the simplest case @xmath116 .",
    "the collective modes related to a local change of the vierbein @xmath114 correspond to the dynamical gravitational field .",
    "the quasiparticles feel the inverse tensor @xmath117 as the metric of the effective space in which they move along the geodesic curves @xmath118 therefore , the collective modes related to the slopes play the part of the gravity field ( see fig .",
    "[ collectivemodes ] ) .    thus near the fermi point",
    "the quasiparticle is the chiral massless fermion moving in the effective dynamical electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "another important property which results from the above equation is that the fermionic propagator in eq.([generalpropagator ] ) is gauge invariant and even obeys the general covariance near the fermi point .",
    "for example , the local phase transformation of the wave function of the fermion , @xmath119 can be compensated by the shift of the `` electromagnetic '' field @xmath120 .",
    "these attributes of the electromagnetic ( @xmath121 ) and gravitational ( @xmath113 ) fields also arise spontaneously as the low - energy phenomena .",
    "now let us discuss the dynamics of collective bosonic modes , @xmath121 and @xmath113 . since these are the effective fields their motion equations do not necessarily obey gauge inariance and general covariance .",
    "however , in some special cases such symmetries can arise in the low energy corner .",
    "what are the conditions for that ?",
    "the effective lagrangian for the collective modes is obtained by integrating over the vacuum fluctuations of the fermionic field .",
    "this principle was used by sakharov and zeldovich to obtain an effective gravity @xcite and effective electrodynamics @xcite , both arising from fluctuations of the fermionic vacuum .",
    "if the main contribution to the effective action comes from the vacuum fermions whose momenta @xmath13 are concentrated near the fermi point , _ i.e. _ where the fermionic spectrum is linear and thus obeys the `` lorentz invariance '' , the result of the integration is necessarily invariant under gauge transformation , @xmath120 , and has a covariant form .",
    "the obtained effective lagrangian then gives the maxwell equations for @xmath121 and the einstein equations for @xmath117 , so that the propagating bosonic collective modes do represent the gauge bosons and gravitons .",
    "thus two requirements must be fulfilled ",
    "( i ) the fermionic system has a fermi point and ( ii ) the main physics is concentrated near this fermi point . in this case",
    "the system acquires at low energy all the properties of the modern quantum field theory : chiral fermions , quantum gauge fields , and gravity .",
    "all these ingredients are actually low - energy ( infra - red ) phenomena .",
    "there is another important symmetry obeyed by massless relativistic weyl fermions , the conformal invariance ",
    "the invariance under transformation @xmath122 . in the extreme limit when the vacuum fermions are dominatingly relativistic",
    ", the effective action for gravity must be conformly invariant .",
    "such gravity , the so - called weyl gravity , is a viable rival to einstein gravity in modern cosmology @xcite : the weyl gravity ( i ) can explain the galactic rotation curves without dark matter ; ( ii ) it reproduces the schwarzschild solution at small distances ; ( iii ) it can solve the cosmological constant problem , since the cosmological constant is forbidden if the conformal invariance is strongly obeyed ; etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider what happens in a practical realization of systems with fermi points in condensed matter  in @xmath0he - a .",
    "close to the gap nodes , _",
    "i.e. _ at energies @xmath123 , where @xmath47 is the maximal value of the gap in @xmath0he - a which plays the part of the planck energy , the quasiparticles do obey the relativistic equation @xmath124 here @xmath125 is the `` electric charge '' and simultaneously the chirality of the quasiparticles .",
    "let us consider the simplest situation , when the @xmath0he - a is in its vacuum manifold , which is characterized by two unit mutually orthogonal vectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and neglect the spin degeneracy of the fermi point . when we consider the low - energy collective modes , these vectors are slowly changing in space - time .",
    "in this situation the effective metric and effective electromagnetic field are given by : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the superfluid velocity given by @xmath130 .",
    "from above equations it follows that the fields , which act on the `` relativistic '' quasiparticles as electromagnetic and gravitational fields , have very strange behavior . for example , the same texture of the @xmath131-vector is felt by quasiparticles as the effective magnetic field @xmath132 according to eq.([emfieldinaphase ] ) and simultaneously it enters the metric according to eq.([gravfieldinaphase ] ) .",
    "such field certainly can not be described by the maxwell and einstein equations together .",
    "actually the gravitational and electromagnetic variables coincide in @xmath0he - a only when we consider the vacuum manifold : outside of this manifold they split .",
    "@xmath0he - a , as any other fermionic system with fermi point , has enough number of collective modes to provide the analogs for the independent gravitational and electromagnetic fields . but some of these modes are massive in @xmath0he - a .",
    "for example the gravitational waves correspond to the modes , which are different from the oscillations of the @xmath131-vector . as distinct from the photons ( orbital waves  propagating oscillations of the @xmath131-vector ) the gravitons are massive @xcite .",
    "all these troubles occur because in @xmath0he - a the main contribution to the effective action for bosonic fields come from the vacuum fermions at the `` planck '' energy scale , @xmath133 .",
    "these fermions are far from the fermi points and their spectrum is nonlinear .",
    "that is why in general the effective action is not symmetric .",
    "there are , however , exclusions , for example , the action for the @xmath131-field contains the term with the logarithmically divergent factor @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "it comes from the zero charge effect , experienced by the vacuum of the massless fermions for whom the @xmath131-field acts as electromagnetic field . due to its logarithmic divergence",
    "this term is dominanting at low frequency @xmath135 : the lower the frequency the larger is the contribution of the vacuum fermions from the vicinity of the fermi point and thus the more symmetric is the lagrangian for the @xmath136-field . as a result , in the very low - energy limit , when the non - logarithmic contributions can be neglected , the effective lagrangian for the @xmath121 becomes gauge invariant and even obeys the general covariance : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the strength of the effective electromagnetic field @xmath121 from eq.([emfieldinaphase ] ) and @xmath113 is the effective gravitational field from eq.([gravfieldinaphase ] ) . in this regime",
    "the @xmath121 field does obey the maxwell equations in a curved space .      on the other hand the `` einstein '' action for @xmath117 is highly contaminated by many noncovariant terms , which come from the integration over the `` nonrelativistic '' high energy degrees of freedom at `` planck '' scale . in this sense",
    "the @xmath0he - a , with its given physical parameters , is not a perfect model for quantum vacuum . to remove the polluting noncovariant terms",
    ", the integration must be spontaneously cut - off at energies much below the `` planck '' scale , @xmath139 , for example , due to strong quasiparticle relaxation .",
    "the main reason why @xmath0he - a is not a good substance , is that the fermi points of the left particles , i.e. at @xmath140 , and the fermi points of the right particles , i.e. at @xmath141 , are far from each orher in equilibrium .",
    "the `` perfect '' condensed matter would be such where all the fermi points are at the origin , at @xmath142 , as it happens in the standard model .",
    "however , inspite of the absence of general covariance even in the low - energy corner , many different properties of the physical vacuum with a fermi point , whose direct observation are still far from realization , can be simulated in @xmath0he - a .",
    "one of them is the chiral anomaly .",
    "the chiral anomaly is the phenomenon which allows the nucleation of the fermionic charge from the vacuum @xcite .",
    "such nucleation results from the spectral flow of the fermionic charge through the fermi point to high energy .",
    "since the flux in the momentum space is conserved , it can be equally calculated in the infrared or in the ultraviolet limits . in @xmath0he -",

    "the radiation can occur without excitation of the detector vacuum , via direct interaction of the particles in the minkowski vacuum with the rotating body ( cluster ) , but the contribution of this process the quantum friction is smaller @xcite .",
    "the rotational friction experienced by the body rotating in superfluid vacuum at @xmath10 , is caused by the spontaneous quantum emission of the quasiparticles from the rotating object to the `` minkowski '' vacuum in the ergoregion .",
    "the emission is not thermal and depends on the details of the interaction of the radiation with the rotating body . in the quasiclassical approximation",
    "it is mainly determined by the tunneling exponent , which can be approximately characterized by the effective temperature @xmath254 .",
    "the vacuum friction of the rotating body can be observed only if the effective temperature exceeds the temperature of the bulk superfluid , @xmath255 .",
    "for the body rotating with @xmath256rad / s , @xmath6 must be below @xmath257k .",
    "however , high rotation velocity can be obtained for clusters .",
    "the cluster containg two vortices rotate around their center of mass with @xmath258 , where @xmath206 is the radius of the circular orbit .",
    "if the radius @xmath206 is of order of superfluid coherence length , the effective temperature can reach @xmath259k .",
    "the process discussed in this section occurs only if there is an ergoplane in the rotating frame .",
    "if the superfluid is contained in a finite external cylinder of radius @xmath260 , this process occurs only at high enough rotation velocity , @xmath261 , when the ergoplane is within the superfluid . on the instability of the ergoregion in quantum vacuum towards emission",
    "see also in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath262 and ergoregion is not present , then the interaction between the coaxial cylinders via the vacuum fluctuations becomes the main mechanism for dissipation .",
    "this causes the dynamic casimir forces between the walls moving laterally ( see review @xcite ) . as in @xcite",
    "the nonideality of the cylinders , i.e. violation of the rotational symmetry by the body , is the necessary condition for quantum friction .",
    "in the above examples of the nontrivial space , the effective gravitational field acts as a fixed external field .",
    "the dynamics of this field has not been discussed here . in most cases",
    "the effective gravity field do not obey the einstein equations .",
    "this is the main drawback of superfluid @xmath0he - a : since the fermi points in @xmath0he - a are too far apart from each other , the dynamical equations for the gravitational field are clumsy .",
    "nevertheless the above textures allow us to simulate many phenomena related to quantum vacuum in the presence of the strong gravity field .",
    "this is because many properties of the quantum vacuum in curved space , which are determined by the geometry , do not depend on the dynamical origin of the geometry .",
    "for example , it is well known that the hawking radiation is a purely kinematic effect and occurs in any geometry , if it exhbits an event horizon @xcite .",
    "that is why the @xmath0he - a quantum vacuum is a right object for simulation of many aspects of physics of vacuum in a curved space .",
    "for example what is the effect of the breakdown of the lorentz invariance at higher energy on hawking radiation .",
    "the entropy of the black hole can be also investigated using the above model , since the microstates within the horizon are well determined and ( at least in principle ) are completely known in the whole energy range including the `` transplanckian '' region .",
    "all these are different aspects of the problem of stability of the vacuum in strong gravitational and other fields .",
    "the superfluids provide many examples of the instability of the superfluid vacuum , and thus allow us to investigate different mechanisms of relaxation of the physical vacuum  the ether ."
