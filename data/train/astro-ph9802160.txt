    "the may 10.98 ut observations occured at maximum light ( see fig .",

    "we note , however , that the introduction of a constant to the power law fit has not improved the @xmath53 substantially ; we conclude that the evidence for a flattening of the light curve at late times is not yet convincing .    the optical fluence @xmath54 ( 3000-10000 , @xmath55 ; sect .",
    "[ sec : spec ] ) , is about 5% of the batse 20 - 1000 kev and 20% of the wfc 2 - 26 kev grb fluences . a similar comparison with the x - ray afterglow ( piro et al . 1997a ; @xmath56 = 7.3@xmath57 erg@xmath6 2 - 10 kev , from an extrapolation of the x - ray light curve for @xmath58 @xmath59 27 s ) shows that the optical afterglow fluence is @xmath1 20 % of the x - ray afterglow fluence .",
    "the optical spectrum of the ot becomes redder before reaching maximum light ( fig .",

    "phases i and ii are not in agreement with the simple and beamed fireball models , that predict less steep or even inverted spectral slopes @xmath34 .",
    "however , these early phases might be explained by a continuous distribution of lorentz factors ( rees & mszros 1997 ) .",
    "lower @xmath63 ( redder ) material takes longer to sweep up a significant amount of external matter and hence its emission is delayed with respect to the higher @xmath63 ( bluer ) material .",
    "the lower @xmath63 material catches up gradually with the decelerated higher @xmath63 material .",
    "hence the rise of the light curve and evolution from blue to red can be explained with building up the emission from material with lower @xmath63 , while the power law decay ( phase iii ) sets in when most of the material has been mixed to a single @xmath63 .",
