    "<S> we apply the procedure to two types of double - dot qubits : the singlet - triplet ( st ) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit . we investigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state : a dc pulsed gate , an ac gate based on logical qubit resonance ( lqr ) , and a gate - like process known as stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) . </S>",
    "<S> these gates are all mediated by an exchange interaction that the interdot tunnel coupling @xmath0 and the detuning @xmath1 , which sets the energy difference between the dots . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure has two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , we optimize the gate fidelity ( @xmath2 ) for fixed @xmath0 as a function of the other control parameters ; this yields an @xmath3 that is universal for different types of gates . </S>",
    "<S> next , we identify physical constraints on the control parameters ; this yields an upper bound @xmath4 that is specific to the qubit - gate combination . </S>",
    "<S> we show that similar gate fidelities ( @xmath5% ) should be attainable for st qubits in isotopically purified si , and for hybrid qubits in natural si . considerably lower </S>",
    "<S> fidelities are obtained for gaas devices , due to the fluctuating magnetic fields @xmath6 produced by nuclear spins .        </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental building block of a quantum information processor is a two - state quantum system , or qubit . </S>",
    "<S> solid state qubits based on electrons confined in top - gated quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite are promising , due to the promise of manipulability , and the overall maturity of semiconductor technology . because charge qubits are subject to strong coulomb interactions , they can be manipulated quickly , at gigahertz frequencies , using control electronics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they also couple strongly to environmental noise sources , such as thermally activated charges on materials defects , leading to short , sub - nanosecond decoherence times  @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , because magnetic couplings are weak , gate operations between spin qubits are slow . for this reason , in most gating protocols spin qubits adopt a charge character briefly during gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> successful gate operations generally entail a tradeoff : charge - like for faster gates vs.  spin - like for better coherence .    </S>",
    "<S> several types of logical qubits have been designed to enable electrically controlled manipulation and measurement of qubits encoded in spin degrees of freedom formed of two or more electrons in two  @xcite or three  @xcite coupled dots . </S>",
    "<S> these logical qubits share experimental control knobs ; however , their spin - charge characteristics vary widely , yielding variations in gating speeds , dephasing rates , and gating protocols .    when characterizing quantum gates , instead of considering the gating time and decoherence time separately , it is important to consider the gate fidelity , a measure of the fraction of the wavefunction that is in the targeted state , which depends on the ratio of the gating time to the decoherence time . </S>",
    "<S> here we argue that achieving meaningful comparisons between logical qubits and gating schemes is greatly facilitated by first optimizing the specific gate operations , taking into account the different dephasing rates of the spin and charge sectors . </S>",
