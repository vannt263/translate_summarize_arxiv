    "both low - velocity sne are possibly pure deflagration of wds .",
    "their low expansion velocities and large amount of intermediate mass elements are consistent with incomplete subsonic burning of carbon and oxygen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the spectra of iptf14dpk were obtained at @xmath20 days with respect to its peak with the double spectrograph ( dbsp ; @xcite ) on the palomar 200-inch hale telescope , and at @xmath21 and @xmath22 days with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) on the keck- telescope at mauna kea .",

    "the spectra are made public through wiserep @xcite .    in order to correct for the galactic extinction , we use the @xcite model assuming @xmath23 . regarding the host galaxy extinction ,",
    "since the equivalent widths of d absorption lines are correlated with the local extinction @xcite , the absence of d absorption at the host galaxy redshifts in the spectra suggests that neither iptf14atg nor iptf14dpk is embedded in a dusty circumstellar medium .",
    "in fact , using the highest signal - to - noise ratio spectra of iptf14atg and iptf14dpk , assuming the width of the d doublet is 200@xmath24 , we derived 3@xmath25 upper limits on the equivalent width of the doublet : @xmath26 for iptf14atg and @xmath27 for iptf14dpk . according to the empirical relation in @xcite , these upper limits on the equivalent width corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . in the following analysis , we do not correct for local extinction .",

    "[ fig:14dpk : lc],scaledwidth=49.5% ]    , scaledwidth=49.5% ]    next , in order to determine their peak magnitudes and dates , we use gaussian process regression to interpolate the light curves ( figure [ fig:14dpk : lc ] ) . a squared exponential function is chosen as the autocorrelation function and the autocorrelation length is determined by the maximum likelihood estimation based on available data .",
    "thanks to the almost nightly photometric sampling , the regression analysis determines both the peak dates and magnitudes with small uncertainties , as shown in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we calculate _ k_-correction in the mould _",
    "r_-band for these two sne using their spectra .",
    "we find that the _ k_-correction is @xmath31mag . hence , going forward , we neglect the _ k_-correction .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:14dpk : lc ] , apart from the first few days after explosions , the light curves of both iptf14atg and iptf14dpk are quite similar . since the mould _ r _",
    "filter is similar to the sdss _",
    "filter @xcite , light curves of both iptf14atg and iptf14dpk also resemble the _",
    "r_-band light curve of sn2002es around maximum , though iptf14atg does not show the fast decline seen in sn2002es after @xmath32 .",
    "the peak magnitudes of iptf14atg ( @xmath33mag ) , iptf14dpk ( @xmath34mag ) and sn2002es ( @xmath35mag ) are also comparable within the slight filter difference .    as can be seen in figure [ fig:14dpk : spec ] , the spectra of iptf14atg and iptf14dpk around and after maxima also match those of sn2002es at similar phases .",
    "in particular , both iptf14atg and iptf14dpk show the low - velocity absorption lines and troughs , hallmark of sn2002es - like sne .",
    "next , the spectra of iptf14atg and iptf14dpk taken at @xmath20days share broad absorption features , although the continuum emission of iptf14dpk appears bluer than that of iptf14atg",
    ". this color difference might be due to residuals from imperfect subtraction of galaxy light in the spectra of iptf14dpk , as iptf14dpk is located close to the center of its apparently blue and compact host galaxy in an interacting galaxy pair .",
    "therefore , we do not think that the blueness of the iptf14atg indicates significant difference from iptf14dpk .    integrating the spectra and calibrating to the broadband photometry",
    ", we obtain an optical luminosity of @xmath36 for both sne around maximum .",
    "since sn radiation around maximum is concentrated in the optical , the optical luminosity is a good approximation to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "in the case of iptf14atg , the explosion date is tightly constrained by the sn - companion collision and therefore its rise time to the @xmath1-band maximum is @xmath37 days .",
    "the total @xmath38ni mass can be estimated from the peak luminosity and the rise time via the following equation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the instantaneous radioactive power at the light curve peak that can be expressed as @xmath41 \\frac{m_{\\textrm{ni}}}{{m_\\odot}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is in units of days .",
    "@xmath43 is an efficiency factor of order unity , depending on the distribution of @xmath38ni .",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath44 here following @xcite .",
    "then we estimate a total @xmath38ni mass of @xmath45 for iptf14atg .",
    "in contrast , as discussed in  [ sec:14dpk : difference ] , iptf14dpk may experience a `` dark '' period after the explosion .",
    "therefore its light curve only provides an upper limit on the actual explosion date , or equivalently a lower limit on the rise time , and thus a lower limit of @xmath46 on the @xmath38ni mass .",
    "in addition , we would like to clarify that the main difference of sn2002es - like events from `` classical '' subluminous sn1991bg - like events is that the former exhibit low velocity absorption features .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:14dpk : spec ] , around maximum , although the overall spectral shapes look similar among sn2002es - like events and sn1991bg , the velocities of the absorption lines , such as , are obviously lower in sn2002es - like events than in sn1991bg by several thousand @xmath24 . at late time , sn2002es - like events develop multiple narrow features between 5000  and 7000  while these features are blended in the spectra of sn1991bg - like events @xcite .",
    "as noted in the previous section , iptf14atg and iptf14dpk exhibit different photometric behavior at early phases . in particular , iptf14atg took more than a week to rise to @xmath3mag with a mean rise rate of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , iptf14dpk shows a steep rise to @xmath47mag within one day of its last non - detection of @xmath48mag , indicating an initial rise rate @xmath4 . in the subsequent epoch ,",
    "the apparent decline in the iptf14dpk light curve is not statistically significant .    at first blush",
    ", the pre - discovery 5-@xmath25 upper limits of iptf14dpk in the magnitude plot may mislead the readers into concluding that the upper limits of iptf14dpk are roughly consistent with the early detections of iptf14atg .",
    "however , when plotted in @xmath30 , the early detections of iptf14atg are distinct from the non - detections of iptf14dpk at similar epochs by more than 3 @xmath25 ( see the inset of figure [ fig:14dpk : lc ] ) . if we approximate measurement noises with gaussian distributions , the probability that the iptf14dpk pre - sn non - detections are consistent with the early - phase detections of iptf14atg is less than @xmath49 .",
    "next , we seek an explanation to the distinct early - phase light curves of the two otherwise similar sne . given the spectroscopic typing and almost identical light curves ( apart from the early rise ) , we make a simple and reasonable assumption that _ all _ sn2002es - like events arise from the same progenitor channel .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the observed early declining uv pulse from iptf14atg provides evidence for the sd progenitor channel .",
    "three energy resources may power the optical light curve of a sn from the sd channel : sn shock breakout , sn - companion collision , and radioactive decay of @xmath38ni .",
    "the shock breakout of a sn ia lasts for less than a second @xcite , so we do not consider this energy resource to explain the iptf14atg and iptf14dpk light curves .    both the sn - companion - collision powered and radioactively powered components are seen in the light curve of iptf14atg . specifically , its uv / optical light curve before @xmath3 days is dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sn - companion interaction signature , and the light curve after @xmath3 days is mainly from radioactive decay . in order to show this",
    ", we fit the sn - companion collision model @xcite to its early uv light curve , noting that a factor of @xmath50 is missing in the @xcite calculation , we find a good fit with an explosion energy of @xmath51ergs , an ejecta mass of @xmath52 , and a binary separation of @xmath53",
    ". then we calculate the _",
    "r_-band light curve from this model and compare it to the observed _",
    "r_-band light curve .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig:14dpk:14atg ] , the light curve before @xmath3 days can be entirely attributed to the rayleigh - jeans tail emission from the sn - companion collision . in later epochs ,",
    "radiation from the sn - companion interaction becomes minor and the light curve has to be powered by the radioactive energy .",
    "in fact , as noted by @xcite , given typical mass ratios of a few for sd progenitor binaries of sne ia , only less than 10% of the resulting explosions would have geometry that would allow the sn - companion collision signature to be seen by a randomly located observer . for the remaining @xmath54 events",
    ", we can only see the radioactively powered light curves .",
    "this provides a natural explanation to iptf14dpk : the observed iptf14dpk light curve is purely powered by its radioactive decay .    if we make a further assumption that both iptf14atg and iptf14dpk have similar ejecta structures , then the radioactively powered light curves of iptf14atg and iptf14dpk have similar shapes . despite the observed @xmath55mag difference at peak magnitudes which is probably due to the exact amount of synthesized @xmath38ni , the light curve of iptf14atg can be roughly treated as a superposition of the sn - companion collision light curve and the iptf14dpk light curve ( figure [ fig:14dpk:14atg ] ) .",
    "-band light curve of iptf14atg has two component : the earlier component ( blue dashed curve ) is the rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal emission computed from sn - companion collision model .",
    "the later component ( red dashed curve ) , powered by @xmath38ni , is represented by the iptf14dpk light curve offset by @xmath56 to match the peak magnitude of iptf14atg . _",
    "lower panel : _ the early @xmath1-band light curve of iptf14dpk is purely powered by @xmath38ni .",
    "the post - explosion `` dark '' period is highlighted in gray .",
    "[ fig:14dpk:14atg ] , scaledwidth=49.5% ]      the sharp rise of iptf14dpk was initially considered to be a possible sn - companion interaction signature , but our further analysis soon rejected this hypothesis . according to the scaling relations in @xcite , the luminosity from a sn - companion collision @xmath57 and the effective temperature @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the binary separation , @xmath60 is the explosion energy and @xmath61 is the total ejecta mass . since the temperature is very high , the radiation flux in the @xmath62 band can be approximated by the rayleigh - jeans law , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the @xmath1-band flux is insensitive to the binary separation .",
    "if iptf14dpk has an ejecta mass similar to iptf14atg , then in order to fit the first detection of @xmath64 of iptf14dpk , its explosion energy has to be @xmath65ergs .",
    "such a large explosion energy would then lead to an expansion velocity significantly higher than the low expansion velocity of iptf14dpk derived from its spectral lines .",
    "furthermore , as the effective temperature remains high , the expansion of the sn would make the @xmath1-band flux increase rapidly with time .",
    "however , we do not see a fast - rising light curve after the first epoch of iptf14dpk .      given a binary separation of @xmath53 and an ejecta velocity of @xmath66 , the sn ejecta of iptf14atg hit its companion star within three hours of sn explosion . here",
    "the sn - companion signature provides an accurate approximation to the explosion date for iptf14atg , i.e. , at @xmath67 days .",
    "given the similarity between iptf14atg and iptf14dpk , it is reasonable to assume that the rise time of iptf14dpk is similar to that of iptf14atg .",
    "under this framework we explore the physical consequences below .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig:14dpk:14atg ] , the radioactively powered light curve of iptf14dpk was not visible until @xmath68 days .",
    "this soon leads to an interesting result that iptf14dpk had a `` dark '' period between its explosion and the first light of its radioactively powered light curve . in our framework",
    ", this `` dark '' period also existed in iptf14atg , but was lighted by the sn - companion interaction signature . if iptf14atg had been observed in a different viewing angle , then the sn - companion interaction signature would become invisible and hence the `` dark '' period would appear .",
    "the `` dark '' period is essentially the timescale for the radioactive decay energy to reach the sn photosphere . during the expansion of the sn ejecta , in the lagrangian point of view , the photosphere moves inwards while the energy diffusive front from the shallowest layer of @xmath38ni moves outwards .",
    "as shown in a toy model in figure [ fig:14dpk : deposition ] , a deep deposition of @xmath38ni will delay the first light of a sn by a few days , compared to a shallow deposition .",
    "a `` dark '' phase has also been suggested in the normal type ia sn2011fe @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite performed similar but more sophisticated calculations on the durations of the `` dark '' period for normal type ia sne with different @xmath38ni depositions .",
    "they used more realistic wd models from mesa @xcite , added @xmath38ni at different deposition depths , and performed radiative transfer calculations with snec @xcite .",
    "they found that deep deposition of @xmath38ni in a normal type ia sn may lead to a `` dark '' period of a couple of days .",
    "-axis is the mass coordinate of the sn ejecta .",
    "the location of photosphere ( blue solid curve ) is calculated for a @xmath69 white dwarf model with a constant opacity @xmath70 and a sn expansion velocity @xmath71 .",
    "the dashed red , green and purple curves correspond to diffusive wavefronts for the shallowest @xmath38ni layer located at @xmath52 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the propagation of the diffusive wavefront is approximated by @xmath74 .",
    "the intersection points between the solid curve and the dash curves represent the time of sn first light .",
    "[ fig:14dpk : deposition ] , scaledwidth=49.5% ]",
    "in this letter , we present optical observations of two low - velocity type ia supernovae , iptf14atg and iptf14dpk , from the intermediate palomar transient factory . both are photometrically and spectroscopically similar to the prototypical sn2002es @xcite . despite their similarities around and after maximum , we observed different initial rise behaviors in these two events .",
    "while iptf14atg experiences a steady and slow rise which lasts for 22 days , iptf14dpk shows a sharp initial rise to @xmath75mag within a day of discovery and then joins the rise behavior of iptf14atg .",
    "the apparent rise time of iptf14dpk is only 16 days .    based on the spectroscopic typing and similar photometric evolution , and based on the observed early declining ultraviolet pulse in iptf14atg @xcite",
    ", we make a reasonable assumption that all sn2002es - like events arise from the single - degenerate progenitor channel . by analyzing the early _",
    "r_-band light curves of iptf14atg and iptf14dpk , we show that :    * the light curve of iptf14atg can be decomposed into the early sn - companion interaction component and the late radioactively powered component .",
    "the latter component resembles the full light curve of iptf14dpk .",
    "the absence of the early component in iptf14dpk is due to an unfavored viewing angle along which the sn - companion interaction is blocked by the optically thick ejecta . *",
    "an sn2002es - like event , or for that matter any type ia supernova in general @xcite , may experience a `` dark '' phase between the actual explosion and the first light of its radioactively powered light curve . the duration of the `` dark '' phase is the timescale for the radioactive decay energy to reach the sn photosphere . * in the case of iptf14atg , the `` dark '' phase was lighted by rayleigh - jeans emission from the sn - companion collision .    moving forward , collecting",
    "a large sample of young sn2002es - like light curves will be valuable to verify the viewing geometry effect as well as the `` dark '' periods .",
    "this sample will also put constraints on the geometry of the progenitor binaries for sn2002es - like events and thus the mass ratio .",
    "for example , if the mass ratio between the donor and the primary white dwarf is one , then we would have to find 14 young sn2002es - like events , before we could observe the sn - companion interaction again .",
    "the upcoming zwicky transient facility ( ztf ; @xcite ) and the planned wide - field fast - cadence ultraviolet surveys , such as ultrasat @xcite , will provide opportunities to collect the sample in both the optical and ultraviolet , respectively . assuming that the sn2002es - like event rate is about @xmath76 of the normal type ia supernova rate",
    ", we estimate that ztf will discover eight young sn2002es - like events every year and that ultrasat will find one dozen in its two - year mission lifetime .",
    "these two projects , together with other ongoing and planned fast - cadence surveys , will provide a big sample to estimate the observational occurrence of the sn - companion interaction and therefore to put constraints on the geometry of the progenitor binaries .",
    "additionally , since the presence of a companion star in a sn explosion adds asphericity of the sn ejecta , spectropolarimetric follow - up observations of sn2002es - like supernovae will also provide independent constraints on the viewing angles @xcite .",
