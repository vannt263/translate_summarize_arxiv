    "@xcite , the presence of the statistical errors @xmath170 and the matrix @xmath167 makes it difficult to evaluate the eigenvalues analytically , so only in this appendix , we will take the limit @xmath171 which may be justified in the present setup with the total numbers of events @xmath172 10,000 @xmath173 .    to diagonalize the matrix ( [ rho ] ) with @xmath174",
    ", we first note that the matrix @xmath166 can be diagonalized as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a diagonal matrix and @xmath177 is a @xmath99 unitary matrix .",
    "thus @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be diagonalized as @xmath180 where @xmath181    now ( [ rho ] ) can be cast into a block diagonal by @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a @xmath184 unitary matrix whose matrix elements are given by @xmath185 @xmath186 , @xmath187 are @xmath105 matrices defined as follows and are diagonalized as @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the pauli matrix , @xmath190 and @xmath104 are introduced to diagonalize each matrix and are given by @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the eigenvalues given by @xmath193 \\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda^{(\\pm)}_2&\\equiv & n\\left [ \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\text{db}}+\\sigma^2_{\\text{db}}}{n } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n^f}+\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & { \\ } & \\pm\\left.\\left\\ { \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{n^f}-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\text{db}}}{n } \\right)^2 \\right\\}\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last expression , we have factored out @xmath88 from the eigenvalues for later convenience , and we have introduced the total numbers of events @xmath194 .      putting everything together , we obtain @xmath197 where both the numerators and denominators are divided by the number @xmath88 of bins , because the numerators are almost independent of @xmath88 after being divided by @xmath88 in the limit of infinite statistics  @xcite .    in the present case , assuming that the total numbers of events @xmath93 and @xmath94 are of order @xmath95 and that the number @xmath88 of bins is 32 , our reference values ( [ error ] ) satisfy @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
