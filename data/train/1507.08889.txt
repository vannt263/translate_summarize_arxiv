    "<S> polarized cross - correlation spectroscopy on a quantum dot charged with a single hole shows the sequential emission of photons with common circular polarization . this effect is visible without magnetic field , but becomes more pronounced as the field along the quantization axis </S>",

    "<S> we interpret the data in terms of electron dephasing in the @xmath0 state caused by the overhauser field of nuclei in the dot . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the correlation timescale can be increased by accelerating the emission rate with cavity - qed .    </S>",
    "<S> spins in quantum dots ( qds ) provide a promising platform for manipulating and storing quantum information in the solid state . </S>",
    "<S> optical measurements have demonstrated spin preparation @xcite coherent spin control @xcite and electron - spin @xmath1 photon entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also proposals for achieving photon entanglement @xcite and non - destructive measurement of photons @xcite using charged qds . however , the time evolution of the carrier spin is unavoidably affected by the 10@xmath2 @xmath1 10@xmath3 nuclei in the dot , all with non - zero spin . </S>",
    "<S> one example of the utility of the electron - nuclear interaction is its use in spin pumping the hole into the spin down state in zero external field , by pumping on the spin up state of @xmath0 @xcite . from a fundamental point of view </S>",
    "<S> then , the hyperfine interaction provides an interesting system for manipulating a mesoscopic nuclear ensemble and observing its dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> it has now been established that the electron - nuclear hyperfine interaction is dominated by the contact interaction and is isotropic in a qd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of this interaction manifests itself in studies of polarized photo - luminescence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contrastingly , the hole s </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4-like wave - function has a node at each nucleus leaving the dipole - dipole interaction between the hole and nuclear spins to dominate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction has a strength one order of magnitude below that of the electron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there has been interest in using the hole - spin as quantum bit with reduced decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> direct measurements of the hole spin relaxation time in a vertical magnetic field , @xmath5 , have shown it is hundreds of microseconds @xcite . without applied magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> some experiments suggest the hole spin @xmath5 time is 13 ns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several studies have now estimated the hole dephasing time , @xmath6 in magnetic field is approximately 1 @xmath7 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we study here the emission from the @xmath0 state in a dot deterministically charged with a hole using a diode ( figure [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show photons from this transition display polarization correlation over a timescale one order of magnitude greater than the radiative lifetime when excited by a linearly polarized laser . </S>",
    "<S> this time is short relative to some reports of the hole spin polarization lifetime @xcite and we show that this is a result of dephasing caused by the electron when the system is excited . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the magnitude of the effect as a function of applied external magnetic field and radiative lifetime .     </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0 eigenstates are degenerate and labeled by the spin of the electron ( figure [ fig1]b ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> radiative decay from @xmath0 to the single hole ground state occurs with a change in total angular momentum @xmath10 , the polarization of the photon being correlated with the initial and final spin state . in a dot where the hole is  heavy \" ( @xmath11 ) only the vertical transitions in figure [ fig1]b are allowed : the detection of a left - handed photon ( l ) photon ensures the decay occurred by the left hand transition on figure [ fig1]b .    </S>",
    "<S> the strain , shape anisotropy and inversion asymmetry in ingaas / gaas qds ensures the optically active transition has a mixed heavy- ( @xmath11 ) and light- ( @xmath12 ) hole character @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the state is given by @xmath13 , which we denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> recombination of an electron and a mixed heavy / light - hole now results in elliptically polarized photons from @xmath0 , and @xmath16 may be determined from the emission pattern ( figure [ fig1]d ) @xcite ) . within the sample </S>",

    "<S> a 75% algaas barrier on the @xmath21-side prevents electron charging , so the @xmath0 dominates at 1.2 - 1.3 v. emission from @xmath0 at an energy of 1349.2 mev is excited quasi - resonantly by a linearly polarized laser at 1317.2 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation scheme equally excites both transitions in figure [ fig1]b and the absence of spin pumping ensures there is no build up of nuclear spin polarization , but it does not populate other carrier combinations such as neutral and negatively charged excitons ( figure [ fig1]c ) .    the experiment is shown in figure [ fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> after filtering , the emission is passed to polarization - maintaining fibre - optics which enable 4 simultaneous measurements of correlation in a basis selected by the quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) and the polarizing coupler ( pbs ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2]b presents correlations recorded at zero external field at an excitation power @xmath2210 below saturation , in the circular basis . comparing the sum of the two co- and cross - polarized measurements ( @xmath18 in black and @xmath19 in red , respectively ) , we see a clear difference . </S>",
    "<S> note that both @xmath18 and @xmath19 show a reduced signal within @xmath23 1 ns of zero - time delay due to the anti - bunched nature of the light . </S>",
    "<S> outside the central @xmath23 1 ns there is an enhanced probability of the source emitting two photons of the same circular polarization over the case of emitting photon of opposite circular polarization .    the degree of polarization correlation , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is defined as @xmath24 from which a least squares fit with a function @xmath25 extracts the polarization correlation at zero delay @xmath26 and the timescale , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , this function is a good fit to @xmath20 ( figure [ fig2]b ) . @xmath28 and the decay time of the correlation @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , measurements in the linear - polarization basis ( h / v ) show an absence of polarization correlation ( figure [ fig2]c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> non - zero heavy - light hole mixing is an obvious source of reduced polarization correlation . taking the heavy : light hole oscillator strength of 3:1 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we see that recombination of a @xmath30 hole and an electron in the @xmath0 level leads to an elliptical photon with state @xmath31 , and a @xmath32 hole . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , decay involving a @xmath32 hole and an electron leads to a @xmath33 photon . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b is in the circular basis so detection of a left - handed photon implies the decay came from @xmath30 with @xmath34 probability . in the absence of dephasing in the upper or lower states , this reduces the probability of obtaining sequential left - left photo - detections to @xmath35 . for this qd </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 0.092 , so the probability of co - polarized photon emission is reduced to 0.994 . </S>",
    "<S> this is higher than we have measured , so we conclude an additional factor must be included .     a measurement of the timescale of correlation at zero external magnetic field , @xmath27 , as a function of the normalized intensity of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the data is fitted with an inverse relationship.,width=226 ]    in fact , the data can be explained by the fast dephasing of the electron spin in the upper state , which dominates any dephasing from the hole spin . a coincidence detection event arises as follows : the transition emits a photon that is detected with circular polarization and the hole spin is left in the corresponding state . </S>",
    "<S> some time later , the system is re - excited to the upper state , where electron spin dephasing occurs during the radiative lifetime of the @xmath0 state , following which a second photon is emitted from the spontaneous decay . </S>",
    "<S> these two photons form a single coincidence in figure [ fig2]b . we stress that our model implicitly assumes the hole spin lifetime is greater than the measured @xmath27 , though we envisage that future experiments that reduce the effect of electron dephasing it will be necessary to include the contribution of the hole .    </S>",
    "<S> our studies provide four pieces of evidence electron spin dephasing is the factor limiting the polarization correlation . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the degree of polarization correlation from the @xmath0 observed in figure [ fig2]b is 1/3 . </S>",
    "<S> when excited , the unpaired electron spin evolves through a hyperfine interaction with the nuclei . only those nuclear field fluctuations in the two directions perpendicular to the spin will cause precession . </S>",
    "<S> if this precession is faster than the radiative lifetime of the upper state , its effect is to randomize the spin . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin parallel to the nuclear field is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the mean spin projection along * z * is reduced to 1/3 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the timescale over which polarization correlation is observed is inversely proportional to pump rate , as shown in figure [ fig2b ] . </S>",
    "<S> this can not be explained by dephasing occurring in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the increased excitation increases the number of times the system is excited between photon detection events , and this increases the rate at which the polarization correlation is lost . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , there is no polarization correlation in the linear basis ( figure [ fig2]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a dephasing of the electron spin state in a time faster than the @xmath0 radiative lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we shall show that change in @xmath26 with magnetic field is explained by the dynamics of the electron spin .     </S>",
    "<S> energy level diagram for the @xmath0 transition with finite z - magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the degree of correlation , @xmath26 as a function of external faraday magnetic field ( black points ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated variation with field is shown as a red line . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) variation in the timescale of correlation , @xmath27.,width=302 ]    we next discuss the application of a faraday magnetic field , which removes the degeneracy of the upper and lower states , shown in figure [ fig3]a . </S>",
    "<S> the net field experienced by the spins is the sum of the external field @xmath36 and the internal nuclear field , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this stabilizes the electron spin along * z * and causes it to precess about the sum of the two fields , which is predominantly along the * z * when the @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the application of vertical field increases the value of @xmath26 as shown in figure [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3]c plots the polarization correlation timescale , @xmath27 , versus magnetic field at constant laser intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this value changes from 9.0 @xmath39 0.4 ns at zero field to 14.5 @xmath39 0.5 ns at 300 mt .    a model of the dephasing of electron spin in qds </S>",
    "<S> was presented by merkolov , efros and rosen @xcite . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that on timescales below 1 @xmath7 the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclei in the dot can be considered semi - classically as a  frozen \" magnetic field , of finite variance , but no directional preference . </S>",
    "<S> the electron @xmath40-factor is assumed isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the electron spin @xmath41 , ( initially along @xmath42 ) is given by :    @xmath43sin(\\omega t)\\ ] ]    @xmath44\\ ] ]    where the distribution of nuclear field strengths , @xmath45 is parameterized by the gaussian width of fluctuations , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4]a shows how the spin projection along the * z * direction @xmath47 varies with the external magnetic field @xmath48 @xcite . at fields of a few times @xmath49 the spin - projection along * z * is stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> this has not eliminated the nuclear spin fluctuations , it has merely overwhelmed them at the cost of increased rate of precession about the net field . </S>",
    "<S> any measurement along an orthogonal polarization direction will reveal the increased precession rate .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) projection of the electron spin along the z - direction as a function of magnetic field and time , assuming a nuclear field fluctuation of width @xmath50 100 mt and an electron @xmath40-factor of 0.5@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the averaged projection of the z - component of the spin over the radiative lifetime , scaled in terms of the electron spin dephasing time.,width=302 ]    from equation [ equ1 ] we extract the expected final electron spin projection along * z * , @xmath47 , which is equal to the polarization correlation @xmath26 ( solid line in figure [ fig3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only fitting parameter is the width of the fluctuations in the nuclear - field @xmath46 , set to 100 mt . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing time for this electron @xcite is therefore @xmath51 , which is , as expected , much less than the 1 ns radiative lifetime of the upper state . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a good fit to the data , reproducing the value of @xmath26 and width around zero field . </S>",
    "<S> the model fits less well at the higher fields . </S>",
    "<S> partly , this can be explained by non - zero @xmath16 , but the discrepancy requires further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath46 is within the range derived from a spin - noise measurement @xcite but is greater than inferred from dephasing of the @xmath52 state in similar dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the smaller wave - function extent of the electron when the dot additionally contains two holes . as @xmath46 scales with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volume of spins overlapping with the wave - function </S>",
    "<S> there is a variation in the effective @xmath46 between states . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same reason the electron @xmath40-factor changes in the presence of additional holes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to increase @xmath26 one could employ a host semiconductor without nuclear spin , a qd of greater volume or reduce the fluctuations in the nuclear field . alternatively , figure [ fig4]b shows that reducing @xmath55 to the electron spin - lifetime leads to a significant increase in polarization correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved by placing the dot into a cavity that equally enhances the radiative decay , independent of polarization .    in conclusion , despite the long hole spin coherence time in quantum dots the emission of polarization - correlated photons from the @xmath0 state is limited by electron spin dephasing . a significant increase in the polarization correlation time should be achieved by reducing the radiative lifetime of the @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the degree of polarization correlation can be increased by applying an external magnetic field greater than the nuclear field . </S>"
