    "staggered fermions preserve enough chiral symmetry to calculate the weak matrix elements for cp violations ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and have an advantage over dwf @xcite of requiring less computing , which makes dynamical simulations possible below the physical strange quark mass . in the previous attempt to calculate @xmath4 using unimproved staggered fermions @xcite",
    ", we observed , in @xmath5 , a large dependence on the implementation chosen for the quenched approximation as well as large perturbative corrections at the one loop level .",
    "in addition , it has been known that unimproved staggered fermions have large scaling violations of order @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "some of these problems can be alleviated by improving staggered fermions using fat links .    in order to find the best improvement scheme to reduce perturbative correction and taste symmetry breaking",
    ", we calculated explicitly one loop matching coefficients for various improved staggered fermion actions and operators @xcite . as a result of this study , it turned out that the fat7 @xcite and hyp @xcite fat links , after a higher level of mean field improvement , lead to the greatest reduction .",
    "in addition , the key features of fat links of hyp type are ( i ) that they are local in the sense of involving only gauge links contained in hypercubes connected to the original links ; ( ii ) that they lead to the largest reduction in taste symmetry breaking in the spectrum @xcite ; and ( iii ) that the one - loop renormalization is identical between the hyp ( ii ) ( perturbatively improved coefficients ) and @xmath7 ( su(3 ) projected fat7 ) @xcite .",
    "several useful properties of hyp and @xmath7 links are presented in @xcite .",
    "recently we have calculated the current - current diagrams to obtain the perturbative matching coefficients for the four - fermion operators constructed using the hyp/@xmath7 links @xcite .",
    "we find that the perturbative corrections are reduced down to about 10% level by using the hyp/@xmath7 links .",
    "we also have calculated the penguin diagrams and the results are reported separately @xcite .",
    "these two calculations provides a complete set of matching formula to calculate @xmath4 using the hyp/@xmath7 staggered fermions .    here",
    ", we will present preliminary estimates of @xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 calculated using the hyp ( ii ) staggered fermions at @xmath11 on a @xmath12 lattice with 218 configurations .",
    "[ fig : b_k ] shows @xmath3 as a function of @xmath13 , where the mesons are made of degenerate quarks .",
    "we fit @xmath3 to the form suggested by ( quenched ) chiral perturbation theory : @xmath14 .",
    "the cross symbol in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to the value interpolated to the physical kaon mass .",
    "our preliminary result is @xmath15 , which is consistent with the continuum extrapolated value calculated using unimproved staggered fermions @xcite . in the chiral limit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath16 , which is also consistent with those results obtained using the nlo , large @xmath17 calculation @xcite .",
    "the value for @xmath18 is consistent with the predictions of quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite within large errors .",
    "a major contribution to the @xmath1 amplitudes comes from @xmath8 and @xmath9 the results are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : b_7 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : b_8 ] .",
    "we fit @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the form suggested by chiral perturbation theory : @xmath21 .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that we calculated @xmath8 at the scale @xmath24 using the hyp staggered fermions , which would not have been meaningful for unimproved staggered fermions due to large perturbative corrections .",
    "compared with previous calculation done using landau - gauge operators @xcite , the systematics of the hyp staggered operators are significantly reduced and the results are more reliable .",
    "a major contribution to @xmath2 amplitudes comes from @xmath10 .",
    "there are two independent methods to calculate @xmath10 : the standard ( std ) method and the golterman - pallante ( gp ) method @xcite .",
    "[ fig : b_6 ] shows @xmath10 as a function of @xmath13 . note that unlike the unimproved staggered fermion calculations where the perturbative corrections to the std calculation are @xmath25 , the perturbative corrections in this calculation are modest for both the std and gp methods .",
    "we also observe that the gap between the std and gp methods is reduced at the physical kaon mass using the hyp staggered fermions compared that of the unimproved staggered fermions .",
    "we fit @xmath5 to the form suggested by chiral perturbation theory : @xmath26 .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass are @xmath27",
    "we use the formula given in @xcite to convert @xmath10 and @xmath9 into @xmath4 .",
    "when we use the std method for @xmath10 , @xmath28 . for the gp method for @xmath10 , @xmath29 .",
    "these values are very preliminary and we have not included an analysis of the systematic errors .",
    "in addition , we did not use lattice values for any @xmath30 except for @xmath10 , since we have not yet extracted them .",
    "hence , we plan to calculate all the @xmath31 and incorporate all of them into the calculation of @xmath4 .",
    "we also plan to obtain the optimal matching scale , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we plan to extend our calculation to dynamical simulation using the hyp staggered fermions .",
