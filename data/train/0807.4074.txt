    "@xmath71 there are zero entries . to be specific ,",
    "observe that the first eight columns of rate-@xmath10 code @xmath499 given in contains as many zero as the number of non - zero entries in it , while there is no zero in the remaining columns of the matrix .",
    "when the number of transmit antennas @xmath0 is more than @xmath495 , the total number of zeros in the codeword matrix is equal to @xmath500 .",
    "hence the fraction of zeros in the codeword matrix is equal to @xmath501 for @xmath502 .",
    "now in the remaining part of this section , we show that one can further reduce the number of zeros in @xmath71 by suitably choosing a post - multiplication matrix to it without increasing signaling complexity @xcite of the code .",
    "as seen easily , only the first eight column contain zeros while the others do not .",
    "moreover , the zeros in @xmath241-th column and the @xmath503th column occupy complementary locations , so is also for the pairs of columns given by @xmath504 and @xmath505 .",
    "what it essentially suggests is that we can perform some elementary column operations which will result in a code in which all the entries are non - zero . in other words ,",

    "we formally present this fact as :    the matrix @xmath506 when post - multiplied with a rate-1/2 scaled cod @xmath71 given by @xmath513.\\ ] ] always gives a cod with no zeros .",
    "moreover , the matrix @xmath506 does not depend on any particular construction procedure ( namely the maps @xmath188 and @xmath207 ) used to obtain the constituent rate-1 rods .",
    "it is clear that the first @xmath160 columns of the matrix has @xmath5 zeros in it and in the remaining @xmath514 columns formed by @xmath366 and @xmath367 , there are no zeros as both these matrices are constructed from rate-1 rod by substituting all the variables in it with appropriate @xmath160-tuple column vectors .",

    "this paper gives rate-@xmath10 cods for @xmath0 transmit antennas with decoding delay equal to @xmath46 .",
    "the decoding delay of these codes is half of that of the rate-1/2 cods given in tarokh et al @xcite .",
    "as the maximal rate of a scaled cod is close to @xmath10 for large number of transmit antennas , the codes constructed in this paper are better than the codes constructed by liang @xcite or lu et al @xcite when considered for large number of transmit antennas .",
    "another advantage with the designs reported in this paper is that they do not contain zero entries leading to low papr .",
    "all the four constructions namely adams , lax and phillips construction from quaternions , octonion , geramita - pullman construction and the construction given in this paper will give the same square rod if number of transmit antennas is less than or equal to @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , these four construction will generate the same rate @xmath10 scaled cod if the number of transmit antennas ( of the scaled cod ) is less than or equal to @xmath487 . for more than @xmath487 antennas , rate-1/2 scaled cods will vary with the methods chosen for the construction of rate-1 rods .",
    "due to the largeness of the matrices involved , it is not possible to display two distinct rate-1/2 scaled cods for @xmath516 transmit antennas , obtained by two different construction procedures for rate-1 rods .",
