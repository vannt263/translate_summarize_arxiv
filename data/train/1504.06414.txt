    "for @xmath0 pure or random quantum ising chains of @xmath1 spins coupled via a single star junction or via two star junctions at the two ends , we have introduced a sequential self - dual real - space renormalization procedure that can be explicitly solved in terms of kesten variables containing the initial couplings and and the initial transverse fields .",
    "we have described the properties of the renormalized couplings and renormalized transverse fields in the ferromagnetic phase , in the paramagnetic phase and at the critical point . in particular , we have discussed the finite - size properties of the energy gap @xmath177 at criticality :    \\(i ) in the pure case , the dynamical exponent @xmath178 governing the power - law decay of the gap @xmath2 was found to be @xmath3 for the single star junction and @xmath6 for the watermelon geometry ( for the case @xmath4 corresponding to a single chain with open or periodic boundary conditions , both dynamical exponents reduce to @xmath116 as it should ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the random case , the gap was found to follow the infinite disorder fixed point scaling @xmath7 with the same activated exponent @xmath8 as the single chain corresponding to @xmath4 , so that the number @xmath11 of chains and the geometry ( star or watermelon ) only enter in the probability distribution of the @xmath10 random positive variable @xmath9 .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us mention some link with the recent studies concerning the shannon and rnyi entropies of the ground state wavefunction of the pure quantum ising chain @xcite .",
    "the rnyi entropy of index @xmath179 of the quantum chain amounts to study the binding of the ising book ( see fig . 4 of @xcite ) where @xmath180 half - planes of classical two - dimensional ising models are glued together . taking the anisotropic limit in the other direction leads to the pure quantum star junction discussed in section [ sec_pure ] .",
    "although the present study does not deal with observables that are directly relevant for the rnyi entropy , we feel that the expansion of the dynamical exponent @xmath181 for @xmath182 around the ising plane @xmath183 @xmath184 suggests that the appropriate finite - size scaling variable could be @xmath185 with @xmath186 for the periodic quantum chain , grgoire misguich and jean - marie stphan have replotted their numerical data showned on fig .",

    "the double logarithm @xmath188 found numerically at criticality for @xmath183 by jean - marie stphan @xcite and the singular logarithmic terms in @xmath189 found at criticality for @xmath190 via conformal field theory in ref @xcite also points towards the finite size scaling variable of eq .",
