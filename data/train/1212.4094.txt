    "the present time accelerated expansion of the universe discovered in the observations of the supernovae ia @xcite revived the discussion about the fate of our universe .",
    "a psychologically jeopardy variant of the universe future is that the permanently increasing scale factor @xmath0 and the hubble function @xmath1 can reach infinite values during a finite time interval .",
    "the life - time of such universe is finite , and the catastrophe of this type produces cosmic inertial ( tidal ) forces , which destroy the bounds in all physical systems .",
    "various aspects of the singular scenaria of the future stage of the universe evolution were discussed during last two decades ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) . the specific term big rip ( or doomsday ) entered the scientific lexicon after publication of the paper @xcite ;",
    "nowadays this term indicates a new trend in theoretical cosmology ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it seems to be uncomfortable for physicist to think that the big rip is the fate of our universe , probably , it is a reason that many authors consider the models , in which the big rip can be _",
    "avoided_. in particular , the big rip can be avoided in the @xmath2 , @xmath3-gravity models and their modifications , in the models with chaplygin gas , in the model for the dark energy with various effective time - dependent equations of state ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) . as a more optimistic variant of the universe behavior one could consider the case",

    "the asymptotic regime of this type appears , in particular , in the @xmath5cdm model , which converts at @xmath6 into the de sitter model with @xmath7 ( @xmath5 is the cosmological constant ) .",
    "more general case , when @xmath8 , but @xmath9 is not necessary equal to @xmath10 , is indicated as pseudo rip in @xcite .",
    "various intermediate scenaria with the infinite universe s life - time , in which the scale factor , the hubble function and ( probably ) its time derivative tend to infinity , belong to the class indicated by the term little rip ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite for references ) .      in order to classify the models of three types mentioned above in more detail",
    ", we use the terminology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) based on the asymptotic properties of the scale factor @xmath0 , hubble function @xmath11 , and its time derivative @xmath12 , which are the basic quantities in the isotropic spatially homogeneous cosmological models of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw)-type with the metric @xmath13 \\ , .",

    "in fact this classification is originated from the idea that two bonded particles are influenced by the inertial force proportional to the quantity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the acceleration parameter .",
    "the internal structure of the physical system is assumed to be destroyed , when this inertial force exceeds the internal ( e.g. , intermolecular ) forces .",
    "we think that such force can also be indicated as a _ tidal _ force , if we take into account the following motives .",
    "let us start with the well - known equation of the world - line deviation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity four - vector , @xmath19 is the deviation four - vector , @xmath20 is the world - line parameter and @xmath21 is the parameter describing the world - line family .",
    "the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ devi1 ] ) describes the contribution of the force of the non - gravitational origin ( its structure for the electromagnetic interactions is described , e.g. , in @xcite ) . the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ devi1 ] ) is interpreted as the tidal ( curvature induced ) force proportional to the convolution of the riemann tensor @xmath22 with the deviation four - vector . taking into account that in the flrw model the velocity four - vector is of the form @xmath23 , we can choose arbitrary direction , say @xmath24 , and calculate the corresponding tidal force component @xmath25 .",
    "the result is @xmath26 , thus the interpretation in terms of tidal force is equivalent to the one in terms of inertial force .",
    "this force tends to infinity , when @xmath12 or @xmath27 ( or both of them ) tend to infinity .",

    "this paper is considered to be the third ( final ) one describing the fundamentals of the model of the archimedean - type interaction between the dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) . in @xcite",
    "we established the self - consistent model in which the dark matter is influenced by the force proportional to the four - gradient of the dark energy pressure .",
    "in @xcite we classified the corresponding scenaria of the universe evolution with respect to a number of the transition points , in which the acceleration parameter @xmath43 takes zero values , and thus the epochs of decelerated expansion is replaced by the epoch of the accelerated expansion . in @xcite we considered the application of the model to the problem of light propagation with non - minimal coupling in a cosmic dark fluid with an archimedean - type interaction between the de and dm , and described the so - called unlighted cosmological epochs , for which the effective refraction index @xmath44 , the phase and group velocities , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , were imaginary functions of time .",
    "in @xcite we focused on the solutions with asymptotically _",
    "hubble function and finite acceleration parameter , and claimed that the case of _ infinite _ @xmath27 and @xmath47 is the topic of special discussion .",
    "now we systematically consider the last case in terms of big rip and little rip solutions .",
    "why this consideration might be interesting for readers ?",
    "there are at least three motives to complete our investigation .",
    "the first motif is the following .",
    "the dark energy is considered in @xcite as a fluid with the simplest rheological property : the equation of state is of the relaxation type , i.e. , it takes into account a retardation of the dark energy response , and includes an extra parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "the first question arises : is it possible to avoid the big rip by the appropriate choice of the relaxation parameter @xmath48 ?",
    "the second motif is connected with the effective constant of the archimedean - type coupling , @xmath49 .",
    "when this coupling is absent , the energy density and pressure of the dark matter decrease in the course of the universe expansion , so that the dark matter does not play any role in the asymptotic regime .",
    "however , when the pressure of the dark energy , being negative , becomes infinite in the course of accelerated expansion of the universe , the archimedean - type coupling leads to an effective heating of the dark matter , so that the de and dm contributions happen to be of the same order .",
    "the second question arises : for what values of the coupling parameter @xmath49 the archimedean - type interaction is able to protect the universe from the big rip singularity ?",
    "the third motif is that the pressure of the dark energy , @xmath38 , is the key element in our model , which guides the behavior of both state functions of the dark matter , the energy - density @xmath50 and pressure @xmath51 ( via the archimedean - type force ) , the energy - density @xmath39 of the dark energy ( via the equation of state ) , thus predetermining the behavior of the hubble function @xmath27 and its derivative @xmath12 ( via the einstein equations ) .",
    "this means that in the model under consideration one can classify the asymptotic types of the universe behavior using only one element , just the function @xmath52 .",
    "this function , @xmath52 , satisfies the key equation , which is the nonlinear differential equation of the second order and includes six guiding parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 coming from the three - parameter equation of state for the dark energy , the effective coupling constant of the archimedean - type interaction @xmath49 , the starting energy , @xmath55 , and temperature , @xmath56 , of the dark matter .",
    "thus , ( keeping in mind the initial data @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) we have a possibility to classify all the types of asymptotic behavior of the model using eight parameters .",
    "the question arises : in what domains of the 8-dimensional effective space of the guiding parameters the big rip is reliably avoided ?    in order to answer these questions we organized this paper as follows . in section",
    "ii we remind briefly the master equations for the de and dm evolution in the framework of the archimedean - type model ( subsections iia - iic ) . in subsection",
    "iid we describe our classification scheme , which is based on eight parameters and includes three bifurcation points : @xmath59 ( @xmath49 is the archimedean - type coupling constant ) ; @xmath60 ( @xmath48 is the de relaxation parameter ) ; @xmath61 , the phantom - crossing point . in section iii",
    "we focus on the analysis of the models indicated as models with asymptotic de domination , for which the contribution of the dm to the universe expansion is asymptotically negligible . in subsection",

    "we indicated this asymptotic situation as the de domination ( the coupling constant @xmath49 is not equal to zero , but it becomes a _ hidden _",
    "parameter of the model ) . in this case",
    "only the appropriate choice of the constitutive parameters @xmath48 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 can protect the universe from the big rip singularity . to summarize the analytical results for the de domination epochs we prepared fig.1 .    when @xmath60 , the big rip can be realized on the interval @xmath123 ( or in other words @xmath461 ) .",
    "it can be indicated as the `` classical '' big rip domain .",
    "when @xmath307 this `` classical '' big rip zone contracts along the line @xmath53 to the interval @xmath308 , and disappears at all when @xmath309 . in this sense , the retardation of the de response to the universe expansion , can avoid the big rip , if the relaxation parameter @xmath48 exceeds the critical value @xmath235 .",
    "in other words , when the de relaxation time @xmath310 is bigger than @xmath311 , where @xmath312 is the universe expansion scalar , the regime of the big rip can not be supported .",
    "if @xmath48 is negative , the interval @xmath123 again refers to the big rip scenario of the universe expansion .",
    "the choice of the parameter @xmath54 can not provide the avoidance of the big rip scenario , but it predetermined the type of the big rip : the power - law type , hyperbolic or trigonometric ones .",
    "when @xmath138 , there was no `` classical '' big rip at @xmath60 .",
    "the same fact can be indicated at @xmath198 . however ,",
    "if the parameter @xmath48 is negative , the big rip scenario is possible for @xmath138 , since , instead of retardation , the de displays the acceleration of the response to the universe expansion .",
    "when @xmath139 ( or , in other words , @xmath462 ) , there was no `` classical '' big rip at @xmath60 , however , the big rip becomes possible at @xmath139 for positive relaxation time parameter , @xmath198 .",
    "the most interesting case studied in the paper concerns the model with asymptotic behavior @xmath113 , for which the archimedean - type coupling leads to the effective heating of the dark matter component of the dark fluid . due to the force proportional to the four - gradient of the de pressure",
    "the dm becomes effectively ultrarelativistic and thus plays an active role in the energy redistribution processes inside the dark fluid .",
    "the reviving of this second player in the late - time scenario of the universe evolution change essentially the character of expansion : at @xmath63 the big rip scenaria happen to be _ avoided _ and instead of them the little rip scenaria become typical for the universe late - time evolution .",
    "this avoidance is typical both for the cases @xmath60 and @xmath62 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the so - called anti - gaussian type solutions for the scale factor @xmath0 appearing as some specific exact solution in @xcite , become typical asymptotic solutions in the case under discussion ( see , e.g. , ( [ ar17 ] ) and ( [ toy5 ] ) ) .",
    "these anti - gaussian type solutions correspond to the little rip scenario @xcite , since @xmath463 , @xmath464 , @xmath465 and @xmath466 .",
    "in other words , in this model the life - time of the universe is infinite , the hubble function and scale factor tend to infinity without vertical asymptotes .",
    "discussing the mechanism of the big rip avoidance in the presence of the archimedean - type interaction , we would like to attract the attention to the following feature .",
    "when the coupling constant @xmath49 vanishes , the de pressure behaves as the power - law function of the scale factor . in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath329 and @xmath328 ( see ( [ ar4 ] ) ) this power - law function is predetermined by the first term in ( [ ar6 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath359 , and the dm contribution to the total energy - density gains the same order as the de energy - density , the de pressure behaves according to the super - logarithmic law ( [ ar9 ] ) , which is typical for the little rip . super - logarithmic law for @xmath329 means that the de pressure grows more slowly than in the case of @xmath59 . in other words , since the de transfers energy to the dm due to the archimedean - type interaction , the rate of the de pressure growth decreases , thus protecting the universe from the big rip singularity .",
    "the model under discussion displays that there are three _ critical _ values of the guiding parameters .",
    "the first one is the value @xmath61 , which corresponds to the well - known phantom - crossing value @xmath467 for the de equation of state parameter @xmath468 .",
    "the symptom of criticality is that the term @xmath469 systematically appears in the key equations and expressions ( see , e.g. , ( [ key1119 ] ) and ( [ key0167 ] ) ) .",
    "the manifestation of the criticality is that the solutions with @xmath470 differ principally from the ones with @xmath471 , so that we considered the last case as the special one . in this sense",
    ", one can see some analogy between this model and the critical behavior of the magnetic and electric fields affected by the gravitational wave : we obtained principally different solutions for the case , when the refractive index tends to one , @xmath472 , and for the case , when this parameter is equal to one identically , @xmath473 , since the term @xmath474 appeared in the denominators of the sought - for functions @xcite .",
    "the second critical value is @xmath59 .",
    "again , the parameter @xmath49 appears in the denominators in the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , ( [ ar17 ] ) , ( [ ar199 ] ) , as the symptom of criticality , and the solutions with @xmath59 ( we mean the solutions of the big rip type ) differ principally from the solutions with @xmath63 ( the solutions of the little rip type ) . the third critical value is connected with the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the value @xmath60 can be considered as the critical one , since crossing the vertical line @xmath358 on fig.1 , we see the structural rearrangement of the domains corresponding to the big rip type solutions . in addition , according to ( [ rootsqq1 ] ) , this parameter appears in the denominator , indicating that the situation with @xmath313 ( there are two roots of the characteristic equation ) differs essentially from the situation with @xmath475 ( there exists only one root ) .",
