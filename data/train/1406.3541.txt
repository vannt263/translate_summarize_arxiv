    "since the proton s magnetic moment was revealed to be 2.79 times the size of the dirac magnetic moment  @xcite , studying the internal structure of the proton has been a vibrant field of physics research .",
    "early deep - inelastic electron - nucleon scattering ( dis ) experiments found that leptons were elastically scattered off of partons  @xcite , and further measurements have led to detailed understanding of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) that can be used to describe the collinear quark and gluon structure of the nucleon . at leading order in a perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) expansion in the strong coupling @xmath14 , pdf @xmath15 represents the probability of a parton of flavor @xmath16 carrying momentum fraction @xmath7 of the total proton momentum .",
    "the pdfs themselves are nonperturbative and can not be calculated directly in pqcd ; they must instead be extracted from experimental measurements . from the development of qcd until the 1990s , experimental and theoretical studies focused on the one - dimensional momentum structure of the nucleon , in which the partons are treated as moving collinearly with the parent nucleon . over the last two decades , a variety of theoretical and experimental tools have been developed to study other aspects of nucleon structure , including parton transverse dynamics within the nucleon .",
    "the measurement of transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) provides one window into dynamical spin - momentum correlations both in qcd bound states and in the process of partonic hadronization .",
    "leading - twist pqcd calculations predict very small transverse single spin asymmetries , less than @xmath17 at high-@xmath18 ( @xmath18@xmath19few gev/@xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "however , strikingly large transverse ssas , up to @xmath20% , have been measured at forward rapidity for hadrons produced from transversely polarized proton collisions ( @xmath21 ) , revealing significant spin - momentum correlations in the nonperturbative structure of the proton .",
    "these asymmetries have been observed for collision energies ranging from @xmath22=4.9  to  500gev  @xcite and for hadron transverse momenta ( @xmath10 ) up to 7gev/@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the persistence of transverse ssas into kinematic regimes where pqcd is applicable offers an opportunity to describe this nonperturbative behavior in terms of well - defined functions using the framework of pqcd . at midrapidity ,",
    "no significant @xmath0 has been observed @xcite .",
    "multiple approaches have been proposed to describe the large transverse ssas observed in hadronic reactions .",
    "transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) pdfs include explicit dependence not only on the partonic collinear momentum fraction but also on the partonic transverse momentum ( @xmath23 ) within the nucleon .",
    "similarly , tmd fragmentation functions ( ffs ) depend on both the collinear momentum fraction of the scattered parton acquired by the produced hadron as well as the transverse momentum of the hadron with respect to the direction of the scattered parton .",
    "reactions involving scattering of a proton with its spin perpendicular to its momentum inducing the production of a hadron can provide sensitivity to both initial - state ( pdf ) and final - state ( ff ) effects .",
    "sivers proposed a tmd pdf  @xcite as a possible origin of the large observed transverse ssas , corresponding to a correlation between the spin of the proton and the transverse momentum of the quarks .",
    "semi - inclusive dis experiments have found evidence for a nonzero sivers tmd pdf  @xcite .",
    "collins alternatively proposed a tmd ff  @xcite that generates transverse ssas , corresponding to a correlation between the ( transverse ) polarization of a scattered quark and the angular distribution of pions in the quark jet .",
    "the outgoing quarks in collisions will have a net transverse polarization if the transversity distribution in the proton is nonzero .",
    "electron - positron annihilation , as well as semi - inclusive dis measurements , have now found evidence for a nonzero collins tmd ff as well as a nonzero transversity distribution  @xcite .",
    "all these results indicate that there are sizable spin - momentum correlation effects in qcd bound states as well as in the process of hadronization",
    ".    while these spin - momentum correlations are present in the proton and in the process of hadronization , inclusive hadron production in collisions can not probe tmd pdfs and ffs directly as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "however , these asymmetries do have sensitivity to the tmd pdfs and ffs integrated over @xmath23 , and attempts to describe the data phenomenologically using the sivers and collins effects have been done  @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations using collinear higher - twist quark - gluon correlations  @xcite can be performed and compared to data for inclusive ssas in hadronic collisions .",
    "while these correlation functions do not contain direct information on the transverse momentum distributions of partons , this approach has been related to @xmath23-moments of tmd pdfs and ffs such as the sivers and collins functions for multiparton correlations in the initial and final state , respectively  @xcite .",
    "prior rhic transverse ssa measurements for inclusive hadron production have been described relatively well by a combination of twist-3 effects in the initial and final states  @xcite , but further refinement in both the theoretical calculations , for example through a better understanding of uncertainties , and in experimental measurements , for example through multi - differential measurements in more than one kinematic variable simultaneously , will be needed to test and understand these correlations in detail .",
    "it has been predicted that tmd - factorization may be broken when the partonic transverse momentum is explicitly taken into account , and the partons in the two incoming protons can no longer be described by independent pdfs but instead become correlated across the two protons  @xcite . in this case",
    "any phenomenology used to describe the asymmetries might become more complex , depending on the size of the effects from factorization breaking .",
    "the breakdown of tmd - factorization leads to the prediction of additional spin asymmetries in the case of hadron production in collisions  @xcite , with the possible magnitude of any new asymmetries still unknown .",
    "these effects , due to color exchange , will be interesting to explore further at rhic once phenomenological predictions become available .",
    "this paper reports on measurements of the cross section and transverse single spin asymmetry for @xmath1 mesons at forward pseudorapidity ( 3.0@xmath24@xmath25@xmath243.8 ) from the 2008 rhic data taking period at @xmath22=200  gev .",
    "a total integrated luminosity of @xmath26=6.65  pb@xmath27 was sampled for these results .",
    "the measurement of different produced particle species will help to advance our understanding of the transverse ssas ( @xmath0 ) observed in collisions .",

    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is a particle accelerator located at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "rhic has the capability of bunching , storing , accelerating , and colliding polarized protons  @xcite , as well as other ions , over a broad range of center - of - mass energies ( @xmath22=62.4  to  510gev for polarized protons ) .",
    "the injected beam into rhic is typically made up of 111 bunches of polarized protons , which contain up to @xmath30 protons per bunch for @xmath28+@xmath28 collisions and are collided at several different points around the ring .",

    "a key aspect of the asymmetry measurements is the ability to align the spin vectors of the protons in the beam in a desired direction .",
    "the net fraction of protons in the beam with their spin vectors aligned along this desired direction is called the polarization ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this must be measured to provide the correct scale for any asymmetry measurement .",
    "the polarization of the beams in rhic is determined to within an uncertainty @xmath32 using two different kinds of polarimeters : a proton - carbon polarimeter  @xcite and a hydrogen - jet polarimeter  @xcite .",
    "the proton - carbon polarimeter provides fast relative measurements of the polarization several times during a fill , while the hydrogen - jet polarimeter measurement takes several hours but yields the absolute polarization .",
    "the polarization direction alternates for consecutive bunches which minimizes potential time - dependent and spin - dependent systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , detector efficiency and acceptance effects are minimized , as spin direction alternation in bunches allows use of the same detector for both polarization directions . during the 2008 rhic run , the average clockwise beam ( also known as the blue - beam ) polarization was measured to be @xmath31=0.490@xmath330.017 , while the average counter - clockwise beam ( yellow ) polarization was @xmath31=0.410@xmath330.015 .",
