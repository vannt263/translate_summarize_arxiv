    "there is considerable current interest in studying the collision of two black holes , since these events could be primary sources of gravitational waves for interferometric gravitational wave detectors currently under construction . on the theoretical side",
    ", it is expected that the problem of colliding two black holes will be tackled by some combination of full numerical and semi - analytical methods .",
    "the first three dimensional collisions of black holes are starting to be numerically simulated , albeit with very limited resolution and grid size .",
    "long time stability of the codes is also an issue .",
    "it is therefore of interest to have at hand approximate results which in certain regimes could be used to test the codes . among such approximation methods",
    "is the `` close limit '' approximation @xcite in which the spacetime of a black hole collision is represented as a single distorted black hole .",
    "this approximation has been used successfully to test codes for the evolution of black hole space - times that are axisymmetric and tests are under way for `` grazing '' inspiralling collisions @xcite .",
    "another realm of application of perturbative calculations is to provide `` outer boundaries '' and to extend the reach of cauchy codes into the radiation zone far away from the black holes , as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "finally , perturbative codes can be used after a full non - linear binary black hole code has coalesced the holes to continue the evolution in a simple and efficient fashion as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the perturbative approach requires specifying both a background metric and a coordinate system when performing calculations . for evolutions in the time domain such as the ones we are considering",
    ", one also has to specify an initial slice of the spacetime . in all perturbative evolutions",
    "performed up to now the background spacetime has either been the schwarzschild solution in ordinary coordinates or the kerr spacetime in boyer  lindquist coordinates .",
    "these backgrounds are adequate for instance , for the study of the evolution of `` close limits '' of the bowen  york @xcite and `` puncture '' @xcite families of initial data , which reduce in the `` close limit '' to those background space - times .",
    "there have been two recent proposals for alternative families of initial data that have some appealing features @xcite .",
    "both these proposals are based on the use of the kerr ",
    "schild form of the schwarzschild ( or kerr ) solutions to represent each of the black holes in the collision .",
    "some of these solutions do not have an obvious close limit in which they yield a single black hole , although the close limit can be arranged with a simple modification of the original proposal . in the case",
    "in which the close limit exists , the initial data appear as a perturbation of the schwarzschild or kerr spacetime , but in kerr  schild coordinates .",
    "if one wishes to evolve perturbatively the spacetime , this requires having the perturbative formalism set up on a background spacetime in kerr - schild coordinates . to our knowledge , this has never been done in the past .",
    "the use of kerr  schild coordinates appears quite desirable in the context of numerical evolutions of black holes .",
    "the coordinates penetrate the horizon of the holes without steep gradients in the metric components .",
    "this makes them amenable to the numerical technique of singularity excision , which is sometimes viewed as the key to long term binary black hole evolutions such as the ones needed for gravitational wave data analysis purposes @xcite .    since the kerr ",
    "schild coordinates are horizon - penetrating , developing a perturbative formalism in these coordinates could , in principle , allow the study of perturbations arbitrarily close to the horizon and even inside the horizon .",
    "the traditional perturbative formalisms , based on schwarzschild and boyer  lindquist ( in the kerr case ) coordinates can not achieve this .",
    "having a perturbative formalism that works close to the horizon is desirable in the context of the recently introduced `` isolated horizons '' @xcite .",
    "one could exhibit perturbatively the validity of several new results that are emerging in such context .    in this paper we will develop perturbative equations in kerr ",
    "schild coordinates , taking advantage of the fact that the teukolsky formalism is coordinate invariant .",
    "we will end by constructing a perturbative equation that is well behaved inside , across and outside the horizon .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the teukolsky formalism ( including the setup of initial data for cauchy evolution ) . in section",
    "iii we derive the teukolsky equation in horizon penetrating eddington ",
    "finkelstein coordinates and display a numerical evolution of it . in an appendix",
    "we discuss the equation in outgoing eddington  finkelstein coordinates .",
    "fortunately , the perturbative formalism due to teukolsky @xcite is amenable to a reasonably straightforward ( but computationally non - trivial ) change of background .",
    "the teukolsky formalism is based on the observation that the einstein equations written in the newman ",
    "penrose formalism naturally decouple in such a way that one obtains an equation for the perturbative portion of the weyl spinor . in the notation and conventions of teukolsky ( which in turn follows those of newman and penrose ) , the resulting equation ( in vacuum )",
    "is , @xmath0\\psi_4=0 , \\label{teukor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantities in brackets are computed using the background geometry and @xmath1 is a first order quantity in perturbation theory .",
    "a similar equation can be derived for the @xmath2 component of the weyl tensor .",
    "we will not concentrate on this equation , however , since it has not proven as useful for evolutions in the time domain @xcite .    if we now particularize to a background spacetime given by the kerr metric in boyer  lindquist coordinates , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( and should not be confused with the newman ",

    "therefore the only adjustment needed to specify initial data for the evolution equations we will derive in the next two sections is to insert the appropriate background quantities in the above formulae .",
    "the initial data proposed by @xcite is constructed using ingoing eddington  finkelstein ( ief )",
    "coordinates ( strictly speaking , since the initial data might include net angular momentum , one is really talking about the generalization of ief coordinates to the rotating case , commonly referred to as kerr coordinates ) .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that these families of initial data are currently being evolved using a numerical code where the black holes are treated using the `` excision '' technique .",
    "this technique requires coordinates that penetrate the horizon , such as the ief ones .",
    "the ief coordinates @xmath22 for the kerr metric are defined through a redefinition of the time coordinate of the boyer ",
    "lindquist coordinates as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the natural generalization to the kerr case of the usual schwarzschild `` tortoise '' coordinate , and is defined by , @xmath25    the codes currently being used to evolve the initial data in ief are written in terms of a coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "we will therefore derive the teukolsky equation in the @xmath27 coordinates .",
    "the kerr metric in these coordinates , @xmath28 in addition to changing coordinates , it is immediate to see that one needs also to change tetrads .",
    "the usual kinnersley tetrad is singular at the horizon , and therefore leads to a teukolsky equation that is singular .",
    "however , it is easy to fix this problem by just rescaling @xmath29 by a factor of @xmath30 and dividing @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",

    "the penetrating teukolsky code ( ptc ) evolves the following equation , where @xmath37 is the teukolsky function : @xmath38    to implement this equation numerically , we break the above equation down into a 2 + 1 dimensional one , using a decomposition of the teukolsky function into angular modes , @xmath39 .",
    "the teukolsky equation for each @xmath40 mode now looks like the following : @xmath41 we use lax - wendroff technique to numerically implement these simplified set of equations exactly as done in @xcite .",
    "a full discussion of the applications of this code will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we just highlight in the figures how the code indeed evolves perturbations inside and outside the horizon as expected .",
    "we have set up the black hole perturbation framework in kerr  schild type coordinates . this framework will be useful for comparisons with fully nonlinear numerical codes currently being implemented that run naturally in kerr  schild coordinates .",
    "we have also discussed the numerical implementation of the perturbative evolution equation and how to set up initial data in terms of the initial value data that will be available for black hole collisions .",
    "implementation of this framework for numerical computations is essentially complete .",
    "this formalism allows us to study in a natural way perturbations close to the horizon and may also be of interest to study and test in a concrete fashion several attractive properties of `` isolated horizons '' @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows us to make several predictions about quantities defined with notions intrinsic to the black hole ( like a concept of local mass and angular momentum ) , and their evolution .",
    "several attractive formulae , for instance relating the adm mass to the `` local horizon mass '' and the `` radiation content '' can be worked out . having a perturbative formalism that operates correctly near and on the horizon will allow us to test the validity of these formulae .",
