    "the fe / mg abundance ratio , one of the most important parameters for estimating the age of a stellar system after its initial starburst , is based on the delay of iron enrichment by type ia supernovae and compared with the formation of such @xmath4-elements as magnesium by type ii supernovae ( see hamann & ferland 1999 for a review ) . the delay of iron formation was generally thought to be @xmath5 gyr ( e.g. , yoshii et al . 1996 ) , while more recent studies suggest that this delay can be @xmath6 gyr , depending on environmental conditions of the star formation process @xcite .",
    "the ( uv)/ emission - line ratio of qsos is considered a probable indicator of the fe / mg abundance ratio , which has been measured in various redshift ranges : @xmath7 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter the99 ) , @xmath8 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , @xmath9 by @xcite , @xmath10 by @xcite , and @xmath11 by @xcite .",
    "the median values of the / emission - line ratios are almost constant at all redshifts , while large scatter dominates the distribution of the ratios at @xmath2 , indicating the diversity of the formation histories of high - redshift qsos . on the other hand ,",
    "recent photoionization calculations of fe@xmath12 atoms in the broad - line regions of qsos show that the ( uv)/ emission - line ratio is sensitive not only to fe and mg abundance but also to physical conditions , including microturbulence @xcite .",
    "however , the median value of the / emission - line ratio is expected to converge on a significantly smaller value when the age of the universe becomes less than @xmath6  1 gyr , assuming that the substantial scatter caused by the diverse characteristics ( or microturbulence velocities , etc . ) of the broad - line regions in qsos has the same contribution at any redshift .    in this paper , we report the / emission - line ratios of four qsos at @xmath0 observed by the oh - airglow suppressor ( ohs ; iwamuro et al .  2001 ) and cisco @xcite mounted on the subaru telescope .",
    "in @xmath13 we analyze the data by the same method as in paper  i , and then we compare the results with other observations in @xmath14 . in @xmath15",
    "we discuss the expected fe / mg abundance evolution of qsos using the combined samples of these results , the new sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archival data , and the previous samples in paper  i. throughout the paper we adopt a cosmology with @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the observations were carried out on 2002 february  27 and march  2 and again on 2003 march  20 and 21 , using ohs and cisco mounted on the subaru telescope . since the and are redshifted to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands , respectively , for @xmath0 qsos , the @xmath21-band spectra were obtained by cisco and the @xmath22-band spectra by ohs separately in each observation run .",
    "the typical exposure sequence is 200  s @xmath23 3 @xmath23 4 positions ( cisco ) or 1000  s @xmath23 4 positions ( ohs ) , in which the object is moved about @xmath24 along the slit by nodding the telescope after every three exposures ( cisco ) or one exposure ( ohs ) .",
    "the slit widths were @xmath25 ( cisco ) and @xmath26 ( ohs ) , providing spectral resolutions of 330 and 210 , respectively .",
    "after this exposure sequence , a nearby sao star with a spectral type of a or f was observed as a spectroscopic standard to remove the telluric atmosphere absorption features and to correct the instrumental response .",
    "the pixel scale was @xmath27/pixel with the infrared secondary mirror of the telescope , while the seeing size was @xmath28 . to calibrate the relative flux between the @xmath21- and @xmath22-band spectra , short imaging exposures of 20  s @xmath23 3 @xmath23 4 positions",
    "were executed by cisco in both the @xmath29 ( 1.972.30  @xmath30 m ) and @xmath20 ( 1.501.79  @xmath30 m ) bands , except for sdss  1030 + 0524 .",
    "the observation log is summarized in table  1 .",
    "the obtained data were reduced using iraf with typical reduction procedures for infrared images ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the resultant one - dimensional spectra in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands were combined using the photometric results of the imaging observation by cisco . as a result , through a circular aperture of 22 diameter , the average fluxes between 1.972.30 and 1.501.79  @xmath30 m correspond to the @xmath29- and @xmath20-band magnitudes respectively .",
    "the extraction procedure for and emission lines from the combined spectra is the same as in paper  i : nonlinear @xmath31 fitting for the ( moffat function ) and for the continuum ( power law ) profile with six free parameters , after subtraction of the template from the composite qso spectrum of the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; francis et al .",
    "1991 ) and the balmer continuum template from the uv spectrum of 3c  273 @xcite with various multiplying factors ( see eq .",
    "( 1)(4 ) in paper  i ) .",
    "the fitting range is 21503300 , which is also the wavelength range for our definition of flux .",
    "note that the strength of the emission is determined by shape comparison between our template and the observed spectral features ( large bumps and small depressions ) , which does not require the assumption of the power - law continuum level ( we need the assumption of the shape of the template instead ) .",
    "although the moffat function is very useful for fitting the various profiles of emission lines with the minimum number of parameters , a serious problem is that the fitted profile sometimes has very broad wings . to prevent such unexpected broad wings , we set the lower limits at @xmath32 for the moffat power ( eq . ( 1 ) in paper  i ) and reanalyzed all the data fitted with @xmath33 in paper  i ( see appendix ) .",
    "the object spectra with fitted components are shown in figure  1 , and the numerical results are listed in table  2 .",
    "the spectra with wavelengths longer than 1.80  @xmath30 m are obtained by cisco , and the shorter parts by ohs . the strength of the emission is mainly determined by the break feature at rest 2200 , which is observed by ohs with superior signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the wavelength range between 1.80 and 1.95  @xmath30 m corresponds to the atmospheric absorption band , whose contribution to the fitting results is very small because of large errors .",
    "as shown in figure  1 and table  2 , we detected strong emission from sdss  j1148 + 5251 , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "sdss  j1048 + 4637 also shows significant emission , while the / ratio is not as much as the value of @xmath348.1 reported by @xcite .",
    "the absorption - line feature at 1.29  @xmath30 m in sdss  j1048 + 4637 is the broad absorption line component of ] reported by @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra of these objects fit well into our template spectrum of in every detail .",
    "although @xcite reported a smaller / ratio of @xmath344.7 for sdss  j1148 + 5251 , this inconsistency is mostly caused by the difference in the template under emission .",
    "on the other hand , sdss  j1030 + 0524 and sdss  j1630 + 4012 show almost no emission or any break feature at rest 2200 .",
    "these results for sdss  j1030 + 0524 are consistent with freudling et al.(2003 ) , as well as the unknown absorption - line feature at 1.57  @xmath30 m . as a result ,",
    "even at @xmath0 , the ( uv)/ emission - line ratios still show large diversity .",
    "figure  2 shows the / ratio and the absolute ab magnitude at rest 2500  as a function of redshift , for which we reanalyzed the sdss data on the basis of the dr1 quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath1 data are the same as those plotted in figure  7 of paper  i , except for four objects listed in the appendix .",
    "the median values and the standard deviation of the sample distribution are shown by the squares with the cross bars in this figure whose numerical values are listed in table  3 . although the number of samples at @xmath2 is insufficient to make a statistical argument , we can deduce the trends of the evolution of the / ratio from figure  2 .",
    "first , the median / ratios at @xmath2 are almost constant , while the upper envelope of the distribution plotted by the dashed line in figure  2 shows a probable declination toward high redshift .",
    "second , the median distribution settles into lower ratios at @xmath3 , with small scatter compared to the other redshift . here ,",
    "the downward error bars from these median points are almost equal to the typical fitting errors of the samples in each bin ( column 3 in table  3 ) , while the longer upward error bars are affected by the substantial scatter of the / ratios .",
    "assuming that the fe / mg abundance ratio affects these rough trends , these small / ratios at @xmath3 originated with the dilution of the fe abundance with the outflow gas from low - mass stars after @xmath343 gyr from the initial starburst @xcite .",
    "the scatter of the sample at this redshift ( a factor of @xmath342 between the top and bottom of the cross bars ) corresponds to the maximum contribution of the scatter caused by the differences in the physical conditions of the broad - line regions in high - redshift qsos @xcite .",
    "if this substantial scatter of factor of @xmath342 is the universal nature of the qsos , independent of the redshift , the larger scatter of the @xmath2 samples are affected by the difference in the fe / mg abundance ratio or the time passage after the initial starburst .",
    "this idea is also consistent with the declination of the upper envelope of the / distribution toward high redshift , which is expected to be the initial abundance evolution of qsos .",
    "an alternative explanation for the variation of the / ratios at @xmath35 may be their luminosity dependence such that the qsos of higher luminosities , in a low - redshift ( @xmath360.1 - 0.6 ) sample from _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath37 ) uv archives @xcite as well as in a high - redshift ( @xmath363 - 5 ) sample from near - infrared observations @xcite , are found to have higher / ratios .",
    "the larger variation of the / ratios for the brighter qsos suggests that either the ionizing photon flux arriving at the broad - line - emitting clouds or the physical characteristics of the clouds would scatter more significantly for brighter qsos . to estimate their respective contributions to",
    "the / ratio is a theoretical challenge that requires an elaborate photoionization model of fe@xmath12 in the broad - line regions of qsos .",
