    "supernovae of type iip ( sne iip ) form a major group of core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne ) characterized by a @xmath18 months long phase of almost constant luminosity , called the plateau .",
    "these events originate from the collapse of massive stars that , at the time of explosion , retain a massive hydrogen envelope .",
    "the ejecta , that is fully ionized by the initial shock breakout , cools down with the expansion of the sn and recombines powering the long plateau phase .",
    "a number of papers have shown that sne iip can be fruitfully used as distance indicators .",
    "different methods have been applied to successfully determine extragalactic distances , including the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectral - fitting expanding atmosphere model ( seam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the standardized candle method @xcite .",
    "the application of all of these techniques requires well monitored light curves and high - quality spectral time series .",
    "unfortunately only a limited number of type iip sne fulfill the required criteria .",
    "one well - tested approach to determine the properties of the progenitors of sne iip is through the modeling of the sn data with hydrodynamical codes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the results of type iip sn modeling have confirmed that these sne are produced by the explosions of massive ( @xmath19 ) red supergiant ( rsg ) stars .",
    "an alternative approach for studing cc sne is to search for their progenitors in deep pre - explosion images ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review )",
    ". this has been done for a sample of sne by @xcite , who showed that the sne iip progenitor masses were confined to the range @xmath20 , although dust effects may increase this upper limit @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the theoretical expectation is that stars with masses up to 25@xmath2130 m@xmath7 becames rsgs and explode as type iip sne .",
    "since no star with mass above 15@xmath2117 m@xmath7 has been seen to follow this path , there is an apparent discrepancy between theory and observations that has been termed the _ red supergiant problem _ @xcite .",
    "however , we note that there have been claims of a discrepancy between hydrodynamical and direct progenitor mass measurements for specific sne @xcite that , in view of the still large uncertainties of both approaches , leave the issue still open to discussion . therefore any opportunities for a direct comparison between these techniques are worthy of study .",
    "sn  2012a exploded in a very nearby host galaxy ( d@xmath2210 mpc ) and is a first - rate target for studying the properties of the explosion and the progenitor star .",
    "this , and the fact that sn  2012a has good pre - explosion images available in public image archives , made this object as an ideal target for an extensive follow - up campaign at multiple wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we present the results of this monitoring campaign and discuss the implication for the sn progenitor star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give some information about the discovery and the follow - up observations of sn  2012a , in section 3 we present the optical and nir photometric evolution of sn  2012a and we compare light curves , colour curves and the computed bolometric luminosity with those of other type iip sn . in section 4 we analyze the spectroscopic data , in section 5 we discuss the nature of the progenitor of this sn , both by direct detection in the pre - discovery images and by modeling of the observed data .",
    "finally , in sections 6 and 7 we discuss and summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "sn  2012a was discovered by @xcite in an image of the irregular galaxy ngc  3239 taken on 2012 jan 7.39 ut . the discoverers reported that the transient was not visible on 2011 dec 29 providing a useful constraint on the explosion epoch .",
    "spectroscopic classification obtained on jan 10.45 ut confirmed that the transient was a type ii sn close to explosion @xcite .",
    "indeed a comparison with a library of supernova spectra via the gelato spectral classification tool @xcite gives a best match with the type iip sn  1999em @xcite soon after explosion .",
    "the sn caught our interest when it turned out that deep , high spatial resolution prediscovery images were available allowing for the possible identification of the sn progenitor .",
    "we immediately commenced an extensive campaign of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring that started three days after discovery and ended 407 days later .",
    "the main information on the sn and host galaxy is reported in table  [ info ] .",
    "we note that the sn was also detected in @xmath23-rays based on _ swift _ observations obtained in the first three weeks after explosion @xcite . as discussed in section  [ bolometric ] , it turned out that the @xmath23-ray detection corresponds to a negligible contribution to the bolometric flux .",

    ", the sn magnitude was measured via psf fitting . in our implementation of the psf fitting procedure",
    "first the sky background at the sn location is estimated by a low order polynomial fit and subtracted from the image before performing a simultaneous fit of the sn and the nearby companion stars ( that is all stellar sources in a radius of @xmath53fhwm from the sn ) using the psf model derived from isolated field stars .",
    "the fitted sources are removed from the original images , an improved estimate of the local background is derived and the psf fitting procedure iterated .",
    "the residuals are visually inspected to validate the fit .",
    "an alternative approach for the measurement of transient magnitudes is template subtraction .",
    "the application of this technique requires exposures of the field obtained before the sn explosion or after the sn has faded .",
    "the template images need to be in the same filter and have good s / n and seeing .",
    "while in principle they should be obtained with the same telescope as the specific sn observation ( to guarantee the same bandpass ) , in practice we are bound to what is actually available in the accessible image archives . in the case of sn",
    "2012a we could retrieve deep pre - discovery exposures in @xmath54 bands obtained with the vatican advanced telescope technology ( vatt ) and @xmath55 and @xmath56 band exposures from sdss . for the @xmath57 infrared bands we rely on moderate quality 2mass exposures .    for template subtraction ,",
    "first the template image is geometrically registered to the same pixel grid as the sn frame , and thereafter the psf of the two images is matched by means of a convolution kernel determined by comparing a number of reference sources in the field .",
    "after matching the photometric scale , the template image is subtracted from the sn image and a difference image is obtained where only the transient is present .",
    "again , the instrumental magnitude of the transient in the difference image is measured through a psf fit , where the model psf is derived from the image with the worst seeing .",
    "it is found that the latter procedure is more robust with respect to plain aperture photometry in particular concerning the background level determination .",
    "when we compare the psf fitting vs. template subtraction measured magnitudes we find that they are in excellent agreement when the transient is bright . as a rule we kept the psf fitting magnitudes when the discrepancy is @xmath58 mag and instead adopted the template subtraction magnitudes when the discrepancy is larger .",
    "for the optical bands this occurs for mag @xmath59 whereas for infrared the same threshold is mag @xmath60 .",
    "error estimates were obtained through artificial star experiments in which a fake star , of magnitude similar to that of the sn , is placed in the psf fit residual image in a position close to , but not coincident with that of the real source .",
    "the simulated image is processed through the psf fitting procedure and the dispersion of measurements out of a number of experiments , with the fake star in slightly different positions , is taken as an estimate of the instrumental magnitude error , that mainly accounts for the background fitting uncertainty .",
    "this is combined ( in quadrature ) with the psf fit error returned by daophot , and the propagated errors from the photometric calibration .",
    "the final calibrated sn magnitudes are listed in table  [ opticalphot ] and [ sdssphot ] for the optical bands and in table  [ infraredphot ] for the infrared .",
    "our light curves were complemented with @xmath1-optical photometry of sn  2012a obtained using uvot on board of the _ swift _ satellite and recently published by @xcite .",
    "this includes measurements in three @xmath1 filters with central wavelengths in the range @xmath61  , most useful for the derivation of the bolometric luminosity ( cf . section  [ bolometric ] ) , as well as additional @xmath62 optical photometry .",

    "indeed , as is well known , the redshift of nearby galaxies is perturbed by the influence of the virgo cluster , the great attractor ( ga ) , and the shapley supercluster . it turns out that updated models of the local velocity field yield a distance that is about 20% larger than the above value , that is @xmath103 mpc as also reported by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",

    "when no observation in a given filter / epoch was available , the missing measurement was obtained through interpolation of the light curve in the given filter or , if necessary , by extrapolating the missing photometry assuming a constant colour from the closest available epoch .",
    "the fluxes , corrected for extinction , provide the spectral energy distribution at each epoch , which is integrated by the trapezoidal rule , assuming zero flux at the integration boundaries .",
    "the observed flux is converted into luminosity for the adopted distance .",
    "we note that , shortly after discovery , the sn was not detected in radio setting a fairly restrictive upper limit to the radio luminosity @xcite and that the @xmath23-ray detection , even neglecting the probable contamination by nearby sources , corresponds to a negligible contribution to the bolometric flux of about @xmath117 @xcite , that is @xmath118 of the bolometric flux in the first month after explosion .",
    "the bolometric light curve is presented in figure  [ bol ] together with those of sne 1999em , 2005cs and 2009bw computed with the same prescription .",
    "sn  1999em was selected as reference because it provided the best match with the early spectrum of sn 2012a as given by the automatic classification tool ( cf .",
    "section  2 ) , while sne 2005cs and 2009bw were chosen because they appear to encompass the observed properties of sn 2012a being fainter and brighter than sn  2012a , respectively .",
    "in fact it appears that the early luminosity of sn  2012a well matches that of sn  1999em .",
    "we emphasize that at very early phases the far @xmath1 spectral range contributes almost 50% of the total bolometric luminosity , but in two weeks it drops to less than 10% .",
    "this should be taken into account when comparing with other sne without far @xmath1 coverage .",
    "as noted before , in sn  2012a the _ plateau _ luminosity is not really constant showing a monotonic decline up to @xmath119 days from explosion .",
    "the drop , marking the end of the hydrogen envelope recombination , begins @xmath74 days earlier than in most type iip sne , including sne  1999em and 2005cs , and the late linear tail sets in earlier .",
    "also we note that in sn  2012a the drop in luminosity from the plateau to the light curve tail is deeper than in sne  1999em or 2005cs and similar to sn  2009bw",
    ". moreover the luminosity of the linear late tail is intermediate between those of sne 1999em and 2005cs , resembling sn  2009bw .",
    "as mentioned previously , in typical type ii sne the linear tail is powered by the energy input from @xmath5co decay .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed luminosity decline rate of sn  2012a that , as seen in figure  [ bol ] , matches fairly well the predicted decline assuming that all the high energy photons and positrons from the radioactive decay are fully trapped and converted into @xmath1-optical radiation . in this case , the tail luminosity is a direct indicator of the amount of @xmath5ni ( the parent element in the radioactive chain ) produced in the explosion .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the @xmath5ni mass of sn  2012a was about half that of sn  1999em and about twice that of sn  2005cs .    for a more accurate determination of the @xmath5ni mass",

    "solar metallicity models were used , although as shown by @xcite the precise metallicity has negligible effect on the final luminosity of the models . @xcite also compare the output of the stars code with other stellar evolutionary codes , and find good agreement .    comparing the luminosity of the progenitor to the luminosity of stellar evolutionary models at the beginning of core neon burning , we find that a 10.5 m@xmath141 progenitor is the best match",
    ". the lower limit to the luminosity is 4.6 dex , corresponding to a progenitor with a zero - age main sequence mass of 8.5 m@xmath141 .",
    "if the progenitor were less massive than this , it would also likely be much more luminous , having undergone second dredge - up , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we set a conservative upper limit to the progenitor mass of 15 m@xmath141 from comparing the maximum luminosity of the progenitor to the luminosity of the stars models at the end of core he burning .",
    "the progenitor mass found for sn 2012a , 10.5@xmath142 m@xmath141 , is comparable to the low progenitor masses found for other type iip sne @xcite .",
    "we note that the fact that our progenitor detection is in @xmath67 makes it much less sensitive to extinction .",
    "as found for sn 2012aw by @xcite and @xcite , and discussed in detail by @xcite , there is evidence that some type iip sne have circumstellar dust which is destroyed in the sn explosion , and so the extinction towards the sn can not be taken as a measure of the extinction towards the progenitor .",
    "however , given that the typical extinction of a few magnitudes in @xmath50 seen towards galactic rsgs by @xcite would correspond to a few _ tenths _ of a magnitude in @xmath67 ( a value which is well within our uncertainties ) , this is not of great concern for this sn .      an independent approach to constrain the sn  2012a progenitor s physical properties at the explosion ,",
    "namely the ejected mass , the progenitor radius and the explosion energy , is through the hydrodynamical modeling of the sn observables , i.e.  bolometric light curve , evolution of line velocities and continuum temperature at the photosphere .",
    "we adopt the same approach used for other cc  sne ( e.g.  sne 2007od , 2009bw , and 2009e ; see @xcite , and @xcite ) , in which a simultaneous @xmath143 fit of the observables against model calculations is used .    for computing the models we employ two codes : i ) a semi - analytic code ( described in detail by * ?",
    "* ) which solves the energy balance equation for an envelope with constant density in homologous expansion , and ii ) the general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics lagrangian code presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter is able to simulate the evolution of the physical properties of the ejected material and the behavior of the main observables up to the nebular phase , solving the equations of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics for a self - gravitating fluid which interacts with radiation , taking into account both the gravitational effects of the compact remnant and the heating effects linked to the decays of the radioactive isotopes synthesized during the cc  sn explosion .",
    "the semi - analytic code is used to perform a preparatory study aimed at individuating the parameter space describing the cc  sn progenitor at the explosion and , consequently , to guide the more realistic , but time consuming simulations performed with the general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics code .",
    "foe , initial radius @xmath16 cm , envelope mass @xmath17 ) .",
    "top , middle , and bottom panels show the bolometric light curve , the photospheric velocity , and the photospheric temperature as a function of time . to better estimate the photosphere velocity from observations , we use the minima of the profile of the sc  ii lines .",
    "the crosses indicate the observational data taken at early phases ( @xmath22 20 d ) not considered in the @xmath143 fit ( see text for details ) . ]    in performing the @xmath143 fit , we do not include the observational data taken at phase @xmath144 days that is approximately the time needed for the bolometric light curve to relax to the plateau . at earlier epochs",
    "all the observables are significantly affected by emission from the outermost shell of the ejecta ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "after shock passage , this shell , that contains only a small fraction of the envelope mass , is accelerated to very high velocities and is not in homologous expansion .",
    "the structure , evolution and emission properties of this shell can not be probed in our simulations because at present we adopt an _ ad hoc _ initial density profile , not consistently derived from a post - explosion calculation .",
    "in addition , we point out that our modeling is appropriate when the emission from the cc  sn is dominated by the expanding ejecta with no contribution from interaction with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "in fact , as shown by @xcite , the presence of a csm around the sn ( i.e. the remnant of the red supergiant wind ) can heavily affect the early evolution of the light curves .",
    "in particular , following the collision of the sn ejecta with the csm , kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy , which is emitted as radiation . as a consequence ,",
    "the sn appears @xmath1 bright at early times as was observed in sn  2009kf @xcite .",
    "a similar effect may explain the bright initial @xmath1 peak of sn 2012a .",
    "the interaction of the sn ejecta with a csm can also have signatures either in the radio or in the @xmath23-ray wavelength regions ( cf . for example * ? ? ?",
    "as already remarked in section  [ bolometric ] , sn  2012a was not detected in the radio domain @xcite , while the @xmath23-ray detection corresponds to a negligible contribution to the bolometric flux @xcite .",
    "hence we can safely state that in sn  2012a the contribution from ejecta - csm interaction to the observed luminosity is negligible .",
    "based on the adopted explosion epoch ( section  [ photo_evol ] ) , bolometric luminosity and nickel mass ( @xmath145 , section  [ bol ] ) , the best - fitting model shown in figure  [ model ] has a total ( kinetic plus thermal ) energy of @xmath146 foe ( 1 foe @xmath147 erg ) , initial radius of @xmath16 cm , and envelope mass of @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to a total stellar mass at the time of explosion of @xmath148 , if we account for a @xmath149 compact remnant .",
    "the estimated uncertainty on the total stellar mass is about 15% .    from figure  [ model ]",
    "( middle panel ) one can notice a small ( @xmath810% ) systematic offset between the observed photospheric velocity and the modeling .",
    "this discrepancy could be reduced , at least for the first two months of evolution , by adopting for the model a slightly higher total energy of @xmath150 foe and an envelope mass between 10 and @xmath151 .",
    "however in this case we would get a worse fit to the observed light curve , with a slightly shorter ( by about 3 d ) plateau .",
    "sn  2012a is an excellent sn for intensive study thanks to a number of reasons .    our detailed photometric and spectroscopic optical monitoring , combined with near - infrared photometry and the early @xmath1 photometry from _ swift _ ,",
    "allow us to reconstruct the evolution of the bolometric luminosity and derive accurate estimates of the expansion velocity and photospheric temperature . from our photometric",
    "converge during the radioactive tail of the light curve we could measure a @xmath5ni mass .",
    "our effort was facilitated by a number of favorable circumstances .",
    "thanks to the high resolution spectra we can derive an accurate estimate of the line of sight extinction , which turned out to be very low .",
    "also , the pre - discovery non - detections and early discovery ( in the rising branch of the light curve ) allow to constrain the epoch of the explosion , making sn  2012a an ideal case to test hydrodynamic models .",
    "most importantly , thanks to fortuitous deep , high resolution , archival images and the relatively nearby distance to the host galaxy , we could directly identify a progenitor candidate for sn 2012a .",
    "here we focus on the attempts to constrain the progenitor mass using the two different approaches , namely the direct detection of the progenitor in pre - explosion archival images and the hydrodynamical modeling of the expanding ejecta .",
    "it has been noted that , at least in some cases , the two methods lead to very different results , with the hydrodynamic modeling - derived mass being systematically higher than that obtained from direct measurements @xcite . for instance , through modeling of sn  2005cs and sn  2004et , @xcite found progenitor masses of @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively .",
    "these masses are a factor of @xmath154 time larger than the values obtained from an analysis of pre - explosion imaging , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively @xcite .",
    "in other cases the discrepancy is not so large ( cf .",
    "table  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but always noticeable .",
    "this is also the case for sn  2012a where although the two values are fully consistent within the errors , the best estimate from the hydrodynamic modeling ( @xmath157 including the compact remnant ) is about 30% higher that the direct mass estimate ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "@xcite speculated that hydrodynamic models could overestimate the progenitor mass due to the neglect of multi - dimensional effects .",
    "they argued that explosion asymmetries , which are not included in the modeling , may explain the disagreement between progenitor mass determinations for sn  2004et . in that case , a possible bi - polar structure was suggested based on the line profile of the h@xmath159 and [ o  i ] 6300 , 6364  nebular emissions @xcite .",
    "a similar feature , namely a double peaked h@xmath159 profile observed in late - stage spectra of sn  2012a ( see section  [ spec_evol ] ) could also be an evidence of the asymmetry in the sn ejecta or , most likely , in the radioactive @xmath5ni bubble .    for direct progenitor detections ,",
    "a major source of uncertainty is the presence ( or absence ) of circumstellar dust . in the case of",
    "sn  2012aw , @xcite and @xcite estimated a very low extinction after explosion , but found evidence for pre - existing circumstellar dust which was destroyed in the explosion . for sn 2012a ,",
    "the possible effect of dust is reduced because the progenitor luminosity was derived from a near - infrared magnitude .",
    "a separate source of error arises from the stellar evolutionary models used . as emphasized by @xcite , a different treatment of mixing processes",
    "can change the stellar core mass and hence affect the final luminosity .",
    "in particular , the choice of convective overshooting parameter will alter the final configuration of stellar models , with lower overshooting leading to lower luminosity progenitors for a given mass .    as an independent constraint of the progenitor mass",
    ", we measured the relative intensities of emission lines in the nebular spectrum and compared these values with the predictions of the spectral synthesis model of @xcite .",
    "we found that the [ oi ] and na  i  d line intensities ( relative to the total radioactive energy input ) are close to the predicted values for a 15  m@xmath141 star , also consistent with the estimates given above .",
    "in conclusion , all evidence points toward a moderate @xmath160 m@xmath141 red supergiant star as the progenitor of sn  2012a .",
    "we have presented our extensive data set for sn  2012a , starting from a few days after shock breakout , and covering over one year of evolution to when the sn had completely entered the nebular phase .",
    "the collected observations , which consist of @xmath161 photometry , low and high - resolution optical spectroscopy and a near-@xmath116 spectrum , make this type iip sn one of the most comprehensively observed ever .",
    "the analysis of the observations of sn  2012a show that this is a type iip supernova with own identity .",
    "in particular the plateau appears shorter that in prototypical type iip sne , while the plateau luminosity is never really constant .",
    "the luminosity in the radioactive tail is moderate , which implies a @xmath5ni mass which is intermediate between those of prototypical type iip and faint iip sne . in the future ,",
    "a larger sample of such well studied events exploring the subtle diversity among `` normal '' sne iip , may help to elucidate the details of the explosion mechanism and progenitor properties .    comparing the bolometric light curve of sn  2012a with that of sn  1987a",
    ", we derive for sn  2012a an ejected @xmath5ni mass of @xmath162 m@xmath141 .",
    "this value is intermediate between sn  1999em and the @xmath5ni - poor sn  2005cs @xcite , and close to that of sn  2009bw @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution spectra allow us to estimate the metallicity of a h  ii region close to the site of sn  2012a .",
    "the estimated oxygen abundance is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath163 ( using @xmath164 ) .",
    "the derived metallicity shows that the host of sn  2012a , was in the metal - poor tail of the distribution for the hosts of type ii sne .",
    "a double peaked structure in h@xmath159 profile clearly arises in sn  2012a by day + 112 and disappears at around day + 173 .",
    "this may indicate a bipolar structure of the hydrogen excitation and can be interpreted as a result of the asymmetric ejection of @xmath5ni in the spherically - symmetric envelope @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of the progenitor of sn  2012a in archival images indicates that the progenitor star had a moderate mass of 10.5@xmath142 m@xmath141 .",
    "the hydrodynamical modeling of the explosion ( bolometric luminosity , t@xmath165 and expansion velocity evolution ) and the analysis of [ o  i ] and na  i  d nebular lines fluxes @xcite seem to favor a slightly higher mass , around 14@xmath2115 m@xmath7 . considering the errors on the observables , the assumptions of the evolutionary models , the approximations in the hydrodynamical model , and the uncertainties introduced by a different @xmath5ni mass for sn 2012a compared to that in the spectral models of @xcite , we find that all three mass estimates are consistent with each other .",
