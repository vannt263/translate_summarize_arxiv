    "+ we should emphasize here that fitting has to be done for both real and imaginary part of @xmath1 $ ] , thus the actual compensator structure is twice that depicted in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] .",
    "+        simulation parameters for system * s * are as follows : symbol rate @xmath2 , carrier frequency @xmath3 , with 64qam input symbol sequence .",
    "nonlinear distortion subsystem * f * of * s * , used in simulation , is defined in , where the delays @xmath4 are given by the vector @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 .",
    "digital simulation of the continuous part of * s * was done by representing continuous signals by their discrete counterparts , obtained by sampling with high sampling rate @xmath7 .",
    "as input to * s * , we assume periodic 64qam symbol sequence , with period @xmath8 .",
    "this period length is used for generating input / output data for fitting coefficients @xmath0 , as well as generating input / output data for performance validation .",
    "+ in figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] we present evm obtained for different compensator structures , as well as output evm with no compensation , and case with ideal compensator @xmath9 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] , compensator fitted using the proposed structure in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] outperforms other compensators , and gives output evm almost identical to the ideal compensator .",
    "this result was to be expected , since model in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] approximates the original system * s * very closely , and thus is capable of approximating system @xmath10 closely as well .",
    "this is not the case for compensators modeled with simple volterra series , due to inherently long ( or more precisely infinite ) memory introduced by the lti part of * s*. even if we use noncausal volterra series model ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , which is expected to capture true dynamics better , we are still unable to get good fitting of the system * s * , and consequently of the compensator @xmath12 .",
    "+ advantage of the proposed compensator structure is not only in better compensation performance , but also in that it achieves better performance with much more efficient strucuture .",
    "that is , we need far less coefficients in order to represent nonlinear part of the compensator , in both least squares optimization and actual implementation ( table  [ table ] ) . in table",
    "[ table ] we can see a comparison in the number of coefficients between different compensator structures , for nonlinear subsystem parameter value @xmath13 .",
    "data in the first column is number of coefficients ( i.e. basis elements ) needed for general volterra model , i.e. coefficients which are optimized by least squares .",
    "the second column shows actual number of coefficients used to build compensator .",
    "least squares optimization yields many nonzero coefficients , but only subset of those are considered significant and thus used in actual compensator implementation .",
    "coefficient is considered significant if its value falls above a certain treshold @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is chosen such that increas in evm after zeroing nonsignificant coefficients is not larger than 1% of the best achievable evm ( i.e. when all basis elements are used for building compensator ) . from table",
    "[ table ] we can see that for case 3 volterra structure , 10 times more coefficients are needed in order to implement compensator , than in the case of our proposed structure . and",
    "even when such a large number of coefficients is used , its performance is still below the one achieved by this new compensator model .",
    "the potential significance of the result presented in this paper lies in revealing a special structure of a digital pre - distortion compensator which appears to be both necessary and sufficient to match the discrete time dynamics resulting from combining modulation and demodulation with a dynamic non - linearity in continuous time .",
    "the `` necessity '' somewhat relies on the input signal @xmath15 having `` full '' spectrum . while , theoretically , the baseband signal @xmath15 is supposed to be shaped so that only a lower dt frequency spectrum of it remains significant , a practical implementation of amplitude - phase modulation will frequently employ the a signal component separation approach , such as linc @xcite , where the low - pass signal @xmath15 is decomposed into two components of constant amplitude , @xmath16 , @xmath17|\\equiv|u_2[n]|=\\text{const}$ ] , after which the components @xmath18 are fed into two separate modulators , to produce continuous time outputs @xmath19 , to be combined into a single output @xmath20 .",
    "even when @xmath15 is band - limited , the resulting components @xmath21 are not , and the full range of modulator s nonlinearity is likely to be engaged when producing @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
