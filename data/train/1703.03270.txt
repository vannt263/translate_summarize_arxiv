    "in the last two decades rapid advancement in the theory and applications of complex networks has taken place related to the widespread recognition of their importance in social life , natural sciences and technology @xcite .",
    "an important part of this trend was development of research on complex systems in which interactions among their constituent parts are determined by the underlying structure of complex networks @xcite . in this context",
    "much effort was devoted to study the effect of the complex structure of interactions on the behavior of generic models of statistical physics exhibiting collective phenomena such as phase transitions .",
    "for example , ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition in the ising model on complex , possibly heterogeneous networks was studied by means of various analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite methods .",
    "also spin glass ( sg ) transition @xcite in the ising and related models on complex networks with quenched disorder of fm and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions was investigated using , e.g. , variants of the replica method @xcite , effective field theory @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite . in connection with recent interest in even more complex structures ( `` networks of networks '' ) much attention has been devoted to multiplex networks ( mns ) which consist of a fixed set of nodes connected by various sets of edges called layers @xcite .",
    "mns naturally emerge in many social systems ( e.g. , transportation or communications networks ) , and interacting systems on such structures exhibit rich variety of collective behaviors and critical phenomena .",
    "for example , percolation transition @xcite , cascading failures @xcite , diffusion processes @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite , etc .",
    ", were studied on mns .",
    "also the fm transition in the ising model @xcite as well as diversity of first - order , second order and mixed - order transitions in a related ashkin - teller model @xcite were investigated in the above - mentioned models with the structure of mns .    as a natural extension of the above - mentioned research in this paper the sg transition",
    "is studied in the ising model with the quenched disorder of the exchange interactions superimposed on the underlying structure of a mn . in sec .",
    "2 the hamiltonian of the model is defined , with spins placed on a fixed set of nodes and with separately generated sets of edges ( layers ) , with possibly different distributions of the degrees of nodes , corresponding to randomly assigned fm and afm exchange interactions ; the layers can have , e.g. , the structure of random erds - rnyi ( er ) graphs @xcite or heterogeneous scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite and are generated from the so - called static model @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 the thermodynamic properties of the above - mentioned model are investigated by means of the replica method @xcite . the approach used here follows the study of the dilute sg model with infinite - range interactions @xcite and is a direct generalization to the case of mns of a procedure applied successfully to investigate the fm and sg transitions in the ising model on random er graphs @xcite , heterogeneous sf networks @xcite and the fm transition in the ising model on mns @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 the fm and sg transitions from the paramagnetic state are investigated in the above - mentioned model , the corresponding critical temperatures are evaluated from the replica symmetric ( rs ) solution and the effect of the distributions of the degrees of nodes within consecutive layers as well as the influence of the correlations between them on the phase diagram is emphasised . besides , these analytic results are partly compared with mc simulations . in sec .",

    "mns consist of a fixed set of nodes connected by several sets of edges ; the set of nodes with each set of edges forms a network which is called a layer of a mn @xcite . in this paper",

    "mns with @xmath0 nodes and only two layers denoted as @xmath1 , @xmath2 are considered .",
    "the layers ( strictly speaking , the sets of edges of each layer ) are generated separately , and , possibly , independently . as a result",
    ", multiple connections between nodes are not allowed within the same layer , but the same nodes can be connected by multiple edges belonging to different layers .",
    "the nodes @xmath3 are characterized by their degrees @xmath4 , @xmath5 within each layer , i.e. , the number of edges attached to them within each layer .",
    "the , possibly heterogeneous , distributions of the degrees of nodes within each layer are denoted as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the mean degrees of nodes within each layer as @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    in the ising model on a mn with two layers two - state spins @xmath10 are located in the nodes @xmath11 and edges within the layers @xmath1 , @xmath2 connecting pairs of nodes @xmath12 , @xmath13 correspond to exchange interactions with integrals @xmath14 , @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the exchange integrals are quenched random variables .",
    "it should be emphasised that in the model under study there is only one spin @xmath16 located in each node which interacts with all its neighbors within all layers .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath17 where the sums are over all edges belonging to the layer @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "following the studies of the dilute ising sg models with infinite - range interactions on random er graphs @xcite and sf networks @xcite in this paper it is assumed that the exchange integrals within each layer can assume only two values @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and",

    "however , these two ising models are not equivalent to each other since in a mn the layers are generated separately ( although not necessariliy completely independently ) and thus , e.g. , probabilities for the pairs of nodes to be connected by an edge or statistical averages over different realizations of the sets of edges should be evaluated separately for each layer .",
    "this difference is particularly imporatnt in the case of mns with heterogeneous layers , where it was shown in ref .",

    "@xcite sg transition was investigated in the ising model on heterogeneous networks generated from the static model @xcite . using this model networks with a fixed number of nodes @xmath0 and desired distributions of the degrees of nodes",
    "can be generated as follows .",
    "first , a weight @xmath33 is assigned to each node so that the condition @xmath34 was fulfilled .",
    "then , nodes are linked with edges in accordance with the prescribed sequence of weights , by selecting a pair of nodes @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath35 ) with probablities @xmath33 , @xmath36 , respectively , linking them with an edge and repeating this process @xmath37 times . in this way a network is obtained with the probability that the nodes @xmath12 , @xmath13 are linked by an edge @xmath38 , with the mean degree of nodes @xmath39 , and with the distribution of the degrees of nodes depending on the choice of the weights . in particular , random er graph is obtained if @xmath40 is assumed for all @xmath12 . for a sequence @xmath41 associated with the nodes @xmath3 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , sf network is obtained with the distribution of the degrees of nodes @xmath44 , @xmath45 . in an ensemble of networks generated from the static model the mean degree of a given node @xmath12 is @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , in this paper the ising model on a mn with layers generated from the static model is studied .",
    "the mn with a fixed set of nodes and two layers @xmath1 , @xmath2 is generated by associating weights @xmath47 , @xmath48 with the nodes separately to generate each layer . in this way",
    "the layers can have different distributions of the degerees of nodes @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "let us note that the numbering of nodes @xmath3 while generating each layer can be assumed the same or different . in the case of random er layers",
    "this distinction is unimportant , however , in the case of sf layers it can introduce correlations between the two sequences of weights @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath3 , where now and henceforth @xmath12 denotes the index of the node in a mn , common for all layers . in particular , a mn with independent layers is obtained by randomly and independently associating weights from the two appropriate sets of weights with the nodes and then linking them with edges according to the prescribed sequence of weights within each layer .",
    "the starting point to study the thermodynamic properties of the ising model on mns is to evaluate the free energy averaged over a statistical ensemble of mns generated according to a given rule and with given quenched disorder of the exchange integrals .",

    "@xcite generation of a mn takes place in two stages : first , in which the weights @xmath47 , @xmath48 are separately assigned to the nodes @xmath3 , and second , in which the nodes are connected with edges taking into account the prescribed weights within each layer . at the first stage the weights from the two sets of weights can be assigned to the nodes either independently or certain correlations between the two weights assigned to the same nodes can be present ( e.g. , higher weights from both sets can be assigned to the same nodes ) .",
    "such correlations can change substantially the thermodynamic properties of the model , e.g. , the critical temperature for the fm transition @xcite .",
