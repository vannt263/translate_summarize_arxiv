    "studies on the broad subject area of confined atomic systems have been started soon after the advent of quantum mechanics . a paradigm shift in the facility for doing controlled experiment on confined atom and modern high - speed",
    "computational resource opens up a new horizon for this subject .",
    "the modification of the structural and spectral properties of the atom or the molecule depending upon the number and degree of confining parameters is the interesting aspect of the problem both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "comprehensive reviews @xcite are now available on this topic .",
    "theoretically , different types of confinement model can be realized depending on different physical situations _",
    "e.g. _ atoms under plasma environment @xcite , endohedrally confined atoms and molecules in fullerene cages @xcite , impurities in quantum dots or nano crystals @xcite , matter under extreme pressure in zeolite sieves @xcite or in the walls of nuclear reactors @xcite _ etc_. moreover the confined atom models assume contemporary significance in understanding the cores of jovian planets such as jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "vast applicability of the outcomes from such studies in different branches of science and technology makes the subject a topic of immense interest in the recent times . + hydrogen atom confined in impenetrable spherical cavity was first studied by michels _",
    "@xcite to model the effects of pressure on it s energy and polarizability .",
    "subsequently , many workers @xcite have addressed this problem from different angles to develop a comprehensive understanding about such confined systems .",
    "helium atom confined by such spherical cavity is a much complicated numerical problem as compared to the hydrogen - like ions for obvious reasons . for ions having two or more electrons ,",
    "the effect of electron correlation plays an important role in the structure of the wavefunctions and energy levels .",
    "this effect also undergoes some modifications inside the confinement and it is extremely necessary to adopt an appropriate methodology so that the correlation is properly taken care of . in order to achieve high numerical accuracy in structure calculations of helium - like systems in non - relativistic regime , it is well known that the trial wave function should be expanded in hylleraas type basis set ( an explicit function of inter - electronic distance @xmath9 ) consistent with the dirichlet s boundary condition and the basis integrals are to be evaluated within a finite domain to incorporate the effect of impenetrable confinement .",
    "recently bhattacharyya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite solve the integral analytically in such a way that the problem of linear dependency for larger dimension is clearly avoided even for very strong confinement regime . as a result",
    ", the correlated hylleraas basis set becomes flexible for a complete range of confining parameters and produces accurate energy levels for helium - like ions .",
    "although there exists several investigations @xcite on the series of @xmath10 states of helium - like systems , the progress of studies on the series of @xmath11 states of the same are rather scanty @xcite . to be specific , patil and varshni @xcite first estimated the energy values of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) state of helium under the perturbative framework with a simple single - term uncorrelated wavefunction satisfying proper boundary condition for @xmath14 and the electron - electron interaction was replaced by an effective screening of the nuclear charge .",

    "it is to mention that due to the presence of @xmath18 factor in the generalized hylleraas basis , the solution of the generalized eigenvalue equation within a finite domain becomes extremely difficult for larger dimensions due to linear dependency problems .",
    "_ @xcite carried out the estimations of energy levels of box confined helium - like atoms ( @xmath19 ) using a combination of quantum genetic algorithm ( qga ) and hartree - fock roothaan ( hfr ) method .",
