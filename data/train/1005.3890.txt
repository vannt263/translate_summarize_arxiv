    "the field of stellar evolution has matured to the point that we generally understand the entire evolution of an isolated star if we know its initial mass .",
    "while many details remain to be solved , it is unlikely that sim lite will provide a revolution in our understanding of the evolutionary processes for single stars of low and intermediate mass .",
    "the same can not be said for binary star systems , where there are at present a number of outstanding issues that remain unsolved . among the most difficult",
    "is how mass transfer proceeds during the common envelope stage that occurs in the post - main sequence lives of close binaries .",
    "the formation of nearly every mass transferring binary requires a common envelope phase where the secondary star helps to strip the atmosphere of the primary while driving mass from the system , and shrinking the binary s orbit .",
    "current theory ( c.f .",
    "* ) has a difficult time explaining the creation of systems with massive black hole primaries ( m@xmath0 @xmath1 9 m@xmath2 ) and very low mass secondary stars ( m@xmath3 @xmath4 0.7 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "similar problems exist across the mass spectrum of close and interacting binaries ( ibs ) , which for the purposes of the current study include systems with a black hole , neutron star , or white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a non - degenerate companion .",
    "for example , @xcite explores the well known 2 - 3 hr period gap observed in cataclysmic variable ( cv ) systems , which is postulated to be a result of cessation of mass - transfer from the main - sequence , low - mass secondary star to the white dwarf companion for periods between 2 - 3 hours .",
    "@xcite runs binary population synthesis models that show this theory is only correct if the secondary stars in these systems are up to 50% oversized , and thus both components are really much less massive than has been typically assumed via standard main - sequence mass - radius - temperature relations .",
    "thus , if accurate masses can be determined for these systems , their formation theories can be directly tested .    typically in binary star work ,",
    "radial velocity curves are used to obtain masses for the components .",
    "while it can be quite simple to get a radial velocity curve for one component of an ib , ( the secondary star if it dominates the luminosity , else typically the disk ) , it is difficult , or even impossible , to get such data for their black hole , neutron star , or wd primaries .",
    "thus , along with the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary or disk , one must also assume a mass and know the binary orbital inclination in order to solve for the component masses .",
    "it is especially difficult to determine the binary inclination . in a large number of",
    "ibs the secondary star can be quite prominent at infrared wavelengths , and since the object is distorted , it exhibits ellipsoidal variations as it orbits the primary ( c.f .",
    "the amplitude of these variations are dependent on the orbital inclination , and to a lesser extent , the properties of the secondary star .",
    "however , even a small amount of contamination by the accretion disk introduces considerable uncertainty in this method , and nearly all interacting binary systems have some level of contamination from the accretion process .",
    "thus , this technique of using infrared ellipsoidal variations to determine the inclination fails if one can not ascertain the spectrum and level of the contaminating source .",
    "this paper will show how sim lite , with multi - wavelength , microarcsecond astrometry , will be the first mission capable of determining the multi - wavelength astrometric orbits of ibs .",
    "the field of optical astrometry has recently been making great progress from both ground - based observations , as well as is posed to make dramatic leaps with the upcoming space - based missions gaia and sim lite .",
    "the limits of ground - based astrometry have been recently pushed by both chara and prima / vlti , but neither are capable of the kind of astrometric measurements needed to probe ibs .",
    "chara has multi - wavelength capabilities , but can only provide angular resolution to @xmath5200 @xmath6as @xcite , which is far larger than the reflex motions to be discussed in this paper , and requires very bright targets .",
    "prima / vlti will achieve @xmath530 - 40 @xmath6as precision @xcite , which may be at the limit of usefulness for these systems , but only in k - band , which does not help distinguish individual component orbits , as will be shown .",
    "the gaia mission will provide astrometry for @xmath510@xmath7 objects with 4 - 160 @xmath6as accuracy , for stars with v=10 - 20 respectively , and does posses multi - wavelength capabilities @xcite . however , gaia is a scanning satellite and can not perform pointed or time - critical observations , and in fact only achieves this accuracy by averaging @xmath580 individual measurements , the individual errors of which range from 36 - 1,431 @xmath6as , again for stars with v=10 - 20 respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , gaia can not provide the high - precision , time - critical pointed observations needed to study ibs .",
    "in contrast , sim lite will be able to point at any desired object for any length of time , providing single - measurement accuracy of @xmath51 @xmath6as @xcite .",
    "as well , sim lite will have @xmath580 spectral channels , spanning 450 to 900 nm , thus providing multi - wavelength , microarcsecond astrometry @xcite .",
    "sim lite will offer the first chance at measuring astrometric orbits for a large number of ibs , thus directly yielding inclinations and allowing for the precise measurement of the masses of both components in these systems . determining the inclination of a zero - eccentricity system from astrometry is as straightforward as determining the ratio the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the projected ellipse on the sky .",
    "ideally , one can derive accurate values for the masses of both components from the astrometry of a single component @xcite , but to do so requires that one knows the orbital period , the semi - major axis of the apparent orbit , the parallax of the system , and the mass ratio of the two components .",
    "sim lite can provide the first three of these four parameters , but the mass ratios must be estimated for many of the main systems of interest . however , for binaries where there is a significant amount of light from more than one component , _ sim lite can determine absolute masses for both components_. since sim lite only measures the location of the photocenter of the system , the observed reflex motion of the system will be wavelength - dependent .",
    "for example , in a binary where one component is hotter than the other , the measured motion in the blue part of the spectrum will be different from that measured in the red , with shorter wavelengths tracing the motion of the hotter component , and vice - versa .",
    "thus , if one has at least two astrometric orbits at different wavelengths , and one knows the ratio of luminosities in each bandpass , ( i.e. the spectra of the components ) , then one could reconstruct the individual orbits of each component and obtain absolute masses for both .",
    "since sim lite is currently designed to have @xmath580 spectral channels , and since multi - color photometry and spectroscopy already exists for most ibs of interest , this technique should be quite feasible for most ibs .    in the next section",
    "we describe the procedure and code used to model the reflex motions of ibs . in section 3",
    "we examine the results for `` proto - typical '' systems , including both x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables , and estimate the required observing time required by sim lite to obtain reasonably accurate parameters for each system .",
    "we also briefly investigate how the presence of disk temperature gradients and hotspots in the systems affect the derived orbits . in section 4 we present a full modeling of simulated sim lite data for one system , and show the precision and accuracy of recovered astrometric parameters and derived system masses . we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "refluxis a code that computes the flux - weighted astrometric reflex motions of binary systems . at its core is the eclipsing light curve ( elc ) code , which is normally used to compute light curves of eclipsing binary systems ( orosz & hauschildt 2000 ) . besides specifying the primary and secondary stars",
    ", elc allows for the inclusion of an accretion disk . as with other light curve modeling programs , an array of physical effects",
    "are taken into account , such as non - spherical geometry , gravity brightening , limb darkening , mutual heating , and reflection effects .",
    "the program can either use a blackbody formula for local intensities of the stellar components , or interpolate from a large grid of nextgen model atmospheres ( hauschildt et al .",
    "elc also allows for up to two hot or cool spots to be placed on each star , and on the accretion disk .",
    "thus , elc can reproduce nearly any binary system , including complicated systems such as cataclysmic variables , rs cvn systems , and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "additionally , we have modified the elc code to allow for a mixture of blackbody and model atmosphere intensities for use among different system components , and to allow for the possibility of a free - free , or bremsstrahlung , accretion disk , which follows the form @xmath8 , where t is the temperature in kelvin , and f@xmath9 is the flux in power per unit area per unit wavelength , @xmath10 .",
    "reflux takes input parameters for a specified system and feeds them to the elc program , which generates an intensity map of the system at a specified phase and wavelength , composed of n points evenly spaced on a grid around each star and the disk , if present .",
    "reflux then computes the system s center of light position using the formula @xmath11 where ( @xmath12 ) is the system s center of light ( `` photocenter '' ) , with the center of mass located at ( 0,0 ) , and f@xmath13 is the flux of a grid point @xmath14 , located at ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is done for a complete orbit at 8 different wavelengths , currently chosen to be the standard @xmath16 bandpasses , with the astrometric reflex motion output in @xmath6as using an estimate of the system s distance .",
    "reflux also calculates the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of both the sum and the individual components ( as seen at quadrature ) for comparison to multi - wavelength photometry to help constrain system parameters .",
    "reflux will also output a 3d animated gif of the system , the apparent multi - wavelength astrometric orbit , and the @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of this motion versus orbital phase .",
    "the actual light curves over an orbit are written to a text file for comparison with existing phased - resolved photometric data .    while sim lite only operates in the 4500 to 9000   bandpass ,",
    "we include @xmath19 photometry into the modeling process to help constrain the seds for systems of interest .",
    "we do this because it is often possible to detect the secondary star in the near - infrared , allowing one to better quantify its contribution at the wavelengths accessible to sim lite .",
    "( for consistency and possible comparison to future work in nir astrometry , we also include the j and k - band astrometric motions in the output plots . )",
    "thus , before one can model the expected reflex motions for an ib , it is critical to have both reasonable parameters for the system , as well as multi - color photometry .",
    "reflux requires as inputs estimates of the masses of the two stellar components , their temperatures , their radii , the orbital period , and orbital inclination .",
    "the eccentricity of the binary is assumed to be zero since in the majority of these systems the companion star fills its roche lobe , indicating a close orbit with strong tidal forces .",
    "in addition , the @xmath20 magnitude and distance must be input for model normalization .",
    "if the system has an accretion disk , the temperature at its inner edge , the power - law index for the radial dependence of its temperature , and the radius of the inner and outer edges must be inputted .",
    "alternatively , one can choose whether the disk follows a blackbody or free - free emission law . in the latter case",
    ", one has to specify and adjust a normalization constant for the luminosity of the disk emission to best match the observed sed . to demonstrate the use of reflux , we model several proto - typical ib systems below .",
    "it is critical that one uses reasonable system parameters to first match the observed sed before relying on the output reflex motions .",
    "there are three main scenarios for the visual seds of ibs : 1 ) systems where one stellar component dominates the optical sed , 2 ) where more than one component contributes to the optical sed , and 3 ) disk - dominated systems .",
    "besides the stellar components , and symmetric accretion disks , there are a number of other features that are present in ib systems such as accretion disk hot spots , accretion streams , magnetic structures , jets , and other outflows that both affect the sed _ and _ which might have appreciable astrometric signatures .",
    "we investigate some of these features below , but to completely cover all of the behavior exhibited by ibs is beyond the scope of the current investigation . in the following we perform case studies for three different ib scenarios , using several well known objects .",
    "additionally , we examine how accretion disk or photospheric `` hotspots '' can distort the reflex motions of an ib .",
    "finally , for each system we also examine the feasibility of observing the system with sim lite , providing rough estimates for the amount of time that will be required of sim lite to observe the system at a given precision , using the sim differential astrometry performance estimator ( dape ) @xcite .",
    "there are quite a number of ibs where the primary or secondary star completely dominates the sed of the system . for these systems , determining an astrometric orbit is straightforward .",
    "we examine two cases : 1 ) qz vul , a lmxb with a black hole primary and a cool , main sequence secondary star , and 2 ) cyg x-1 , a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) with an o supergiant primary , and a black hole `` secondary '' .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the sed of qz vul appears to be that of a reddened k2 dwarf from the optical through the mid - infrared .",
    "the system parameters are shown in table  [ qzvultable ] .",
    "these parameters were input into reflux to model the astrometric motions , with a nextgen model atmosphere used for the secondary star .",
    "the model sed , a 3d model of the system , and its wavelength - dependent reflex motions are shown in fig .  [ qzvulmainfig ] .",
    "since there is only a single visible component , qz vul does not exhibit any discernible wavelength dependency to its reflex motions .",
    "however , since the black hole is @xmath524 times more massive than the secondary star , the k2 dwarf has a large apparent motion , and thus even at a distance of 2.29 kpc , the system s astrometric reflex motion ( @xmath58 @xmath6as ) , in theory , would be detectable with microarcsecond astrometry .",
    "however , in practice , this particular system is so faint ( v = 21.2 ) , and has such a short period ( 0.3342 days ) , that , according to dape , sim lite can not reach the needed precision without integrating for longer than the orbital period .",
    "thus , one would need to find a much closer , and thus brighter , lmxb to observe with sim lite .",
    "the estimated orbital inclination for qz vul is 64@xmath21 @xcite , and the only effect one would see with a qz vul type system with a different inclination is a reduction or amplification of the y - component of the astrometric motion , corresponding to an increase or decrease of the inclination respectively .",

    "the x - ray luminosity of sco x-1 is very close to the eddington limit for a 1.4 m@xmath2 neutron star .",
    "the secondary star in sco x-1 has never been directly detected , though an orbital period of 0.787 days was detected through the analysis of 85 years of visual photometry @xcite , and from radial velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected narrow hi emission lines that they showed are from the irradiated secondary star . from these data they estimate masses for the components in this system of m@xmath24 = 1.4 m@xmath2 and m@xmath3 = 0.42 m@xmath2 , thus making the secondary star a significantly evolved subgiant . since the accretion disk dominates the spectrum , we have simply assumed a roche lobe - filling m type secondary star corresponding to the observed mass , and an invisible neutron star .",
    "the stellar and accretion disk parameters are listed in table  [ scox1table ] , and the accretion disk model we employ is similar to that for v592 cas .",

    "thus , as also seen in figure  [ scox1mainfig ] , the reflex motion has a weak wavelength dependence , but sim lite can not observe in the near infrared where the reflex motion reverses , and thus it will be difficult to disentangle the components with such a weak wavelength dependence in the optical .",
    "however , it might be possible to recover the contribution to the astrometric reflex motion for systems with slightly more prominent secondary stars ( e.g. , cyg x-2 ) . as seen in figure  [ scox1mainfig ]",
    ", cyg x-1 has a very small reflex motion , only @xmath51.25 @xmath6as , and can get relatively faint , ( v = 14.1 at its faintest ) , and thus this system is just at the limit of sim lite s capabilities . adopting the faintest magnitude of 14.1 of the system to be conservative , and limiting ourselves to observations of 110 minutes , ( 0.1 of the orbital period ) , to prevent orbital smearing",
    ", we find via dape that we can achieve individual measurements with precisions of 2.2 @xmath6as , almost twice the semi - major axis of the system .",
    "thus , assuming we would need at least 50 measurements to begin to derive a reasonable orbit for this system , this system would require at least 4 days of sim lite mission time , which may prove more expensive than the scientific payoff justifies .",
    "if we are able to observe in its high state when v = 11.1 , we could achieve 30 measurements with 1.5 @xmath6as precision in only 20 hours of mission time , which is far more reasonable . when varying the inclination of a sco x-1 type system , the contribution from the secondary star becomes more significant as more of the disk becomes self - eclipsed and its total luminosity decreases , and thus alters the individual wavelength reflex motions accordingly .",
    "ar uma is a `` polar '' , a cv with a highly magnetic wd primary and a roche lobe filling m5/6 dwarf @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath20-band light curve is complex , being dominated by phase - dependent cyclotron emission .",
    "the near - ir light curve shows normal ellipsoidal variations , allowing @xcite to estimate an orbital inclination of 70@xmath22 .",
    "the magnetic field strength in ar uma has been estimated to be as high as b = 240 mg , though @xcite argue for a lower value of 190 mg . in these systems , at some point after material from the secondary star has passed through the inner lagrangian point , it is captured by the magnetic field of the white dwarf , producing a `` magnetic threading region '' that can be a significant source of luminosity in h@xmath25 .",
    "we investigate the possibility of astrometrically detecting this region via the following modeling process .",
    "we model the system as a white dwarf + red dwarf system without an accretion disk , using the parameters shown in table  [ arumatable ] , but for _ only _ the h@xmath25 bandpass add a narrow `` accretion '' disk halfway between the inner lagrangian point and the wd .",
    "this disk then has a hot spot leading the inner lagrangian point by 45@xmath22 in phase .",
    "the actual contribution from the disk has been made to be completely negligible , but the spot itself makes the system 25% brighter in h@xmath25 . in effect , it is an isolated emission spot located between the wd and secondary star , mimicking a threading region .    as can be seen in figure  [ arumamainfig ]",
    ", there is a large amount of wavelength dependent astrometric reflex motion as expected , ranging from @xmath510 - 20 @xmath6as in the optical , with the wd dominating at short wavelengths and the secondary star dominating at long wavelengths .",
    "this should easily allow the determination of both component masses with orbital coverage at a few passbands . according to dape , limiting individual observations to 12 minutes , ( 0.1 of the orbital period ) , to prevent orbital smearing",
    ", one could obtain individual measurements of @xmath56 @xmath6as precision at the system s brightest , ( v = 14.5 ) , or @xmath548 @xmath6as at its faintest , ( v = 18.0 ) .",
    "thus , in its high state one could obtain 30 , @xmath56 @xmath6as precision , measurements in as little as 9 hours of total mission time , but in its low state , assuming 100 , @xmath548 @xmath6as precision , measurements would yield a meaningful solution , a total mission time of 30 hours would be required , which is still a reasonable amount of time for the scientific payoff in our opinion .    of particular interest",
    "is that in h@xmath25 the threading region produces a detectable astrometric signature that has a phase offset of @xmath515@xmath22 from the broadband wavelengths , due to the original 45@xmath22 offset of the hot spot diluted by the light from the rest of the system .",
    "thus , through use of narrow - band astrometry , one could recover the location of the threading accretion regions in these types of systems . when varying the inclination angle for a ar uma type system , the y component of the astrometric motion decreases with increasing inclination angle for all wavelengths as expected , but at large inclination angles eclipse effects produce significant deviations from simple sinusoidal reflex motions .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to perform a full simulation of exactly what parameters and to what precision one could extract with a given amount of sim lite time at specific wavelengths for each system , we can present a basic analysis for the ss cyg system . to test the accuracy and precision to which we can recover system parameters",
    ", we generated simulated astrometric data for ss cyg in the u and v bands , using the parameters listed in table  [ sscygtable ] , but with an inclination of 54.0@xmath22 , comprised of 10 measurements at random phases with 1.7 @xmath6as gaussian noise added to each measurement .",
    "we then simultaneously solved for the astrometric parameters of period , semi - major axis , inclination , the position angle of the line of nodes , and the angle in the plane of the true orbit between the line of nodes and the major axis , while fixing the the eccentricity and the epoch of passage through periastron to be zero , using the gaussfit program @xcite , with a procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we recover inclinations of 55.6 @xmath26 5.1 and 54.0 @xmath26 3.8 degrees , and semi - major axes of 13.58 @xmath26 0.94 and 23.58 @xmath26 1.28 @xmath6as , each for the u and v - bands respectively .",
    "given the distance to the system of 159.5 parsecs @xcite , and assuming that 58% of the u - band astrometric motion results from the white dwarf , and 69% of the v - band flux results from the secondary star , as per the modeling , ( see  3.2.1 ) , this yields masses of 0.559 @xmath26 0.070 and 0.815 @xmath26 0.096 m@xmath2 for the secondary star and white dwarf respectively , compared to the input masses of 0.555 and 0.812 m@xmath2 .",
    "thus , one will be able to disentangle individual component masses with reasonable uncertainties for this system with only @xmath58 hours of sim mission time .",
    "we have presented a modeling code , reflux , that is capable of modeling the multi - wavelength astrometric signature of interacting binaries . we have presented models for multiple ib systems , and find that for primary or secondary star dominated systems , the contamination of the photocenter is minimal and sim lite will provide good astrometric orbits if the system is bright enough , yielding absolute inclinations and indirect masses . for mixed component systems , sim lite will be able to directly determine absolute masses for both components when multi - wavelength astrometric curves are obtained and combined with existing spectroscopy and multi - color photometry . for disk - dominated systems ,",
    "sim lite will only be able to obtain astrometric orbits for a few systems , due to the small relative motion of the compact object that the disk surrounds , but these should yield accurate inclinations .",
    "we find that while multi - wavelength sim lite data will be unable to distinguish between various disk temperature gradients and disk hotspots , it should be able to determine the location of magnetic threading regions in polars , and thus similar effects in other systems , via narrow wavelength astrometry . in total ,",
    "sim lite should contribute greatly to our understanding of interacting binary systems , especially if its multi - wavelength capability is maintained in the final design .",
