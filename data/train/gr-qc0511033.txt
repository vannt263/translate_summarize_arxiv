    "the search for gravitational waves is one of the most challenging projects of 21st century physics . inspiraling compact binaries are among the most promising sources for gravitational waves that could be detected by gravitational waves observatories , such as ligo , virgo and geo600 . during most of the inspiral time the gravitational waves emitted by a compact binary system are much to weak , the frequencies are much to small to be detectable by existing gravitational wave observatories .",
    "however , at orbital distances corresponding to the last 10 or 15 minutes of the inspiral time , the orbital frequency increases from around 1 hz up to 1000 hz , while in the same time the amplitude of the gravitational waves increases , thus improving the chance of actually detecting the weak signals .",
    "+ in order to extract a possible signal from the detector noise the gravitational waveforms emitted by inspiraling binary systems must be known in great detail , in particular during the last stages of the inspiral process before the final plunge .",
    "the frequency gap covered by contemporary gravitational wave observatories ranges from 1 to 1000 hz . in this regime post - newtonian ( pn )",
    "effects become important and have to be included into the analysis . for non spinning point - particle binaries",
    "an analytic solution is available up to the 3rd pn approximation @xcite . incorporating the spin leads to enormeous complifications . until now there exists a solution only for point - mass binaries with either two equal masses and arbitrary spins , or two arbitrary masses and only one spinning object @xcite .",
    "+ however , while the components of black hole - black hole binaries can be treated as pointlike objects eventually up to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , yet another effect has to be incorporated into the analysis for all other binary systems : the internal structure of the components .",
    "lai and wiseman argue that during most of the final inspiral process even the neutron stars can be treated as pointlike objects @xcite .",
    "this is true if one considers only a few orbits .",
    "if , however , one is interested in the long - term evolution of the system , the tidal interaction of the neutron stars will lead to a phase shift in the gravitational waveforms , which is not neglegible anymore .",
    "+ in this paper we shall focus on the problem of including tidal interaction into the equations of motion and we discuss the influence of the internal stellar dynamics on the binary s dynamics as well as on the gravitational waveforms in leading order approximation .",
    "post - newtonian effects will be included in a forthcoming paper . +",
    "a detailed description of the tidal interaction and the corresponding changes in the gravitational waveforms requires the application of three - dimensional numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "this is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead we shall consider an approximative formulation of the problem .",
    "this strategy allows an analytic formulation of the equations of motion .",
    "moreover , we are able to run long - term calculations of the system s dynamics with sufficient accuracy .",
    "there are basically two approaches for an approximate description of the tidal interaction .",
    "the first one is based on a linear adiabatic theory , describing small derivations from equilibrium .",
    "assuming an adiabatic equation of state , the linearized equations of hydrodynamics have been derived by ledoux and walraven @xcite and dziembowski @xcite .",
    "press and teukolsky @xcite developed a technique for calculating normal modes of non - radial stellar oscillations in the presence of tidal forces . using the formulation of dziembowski , kokkotas and schfer studied the leading order dynamics and gravitational waveforms of an ns - ns binary system , in particular taking into account the influence of tidal interaction on the actual waveforms @xcite .",
    "resonant tidal excitations of a binary neutron star with polytropic equations of state have been investigated by ho in leading order approximation @xcite .",
    "+ however , there are scenarios when the linear adiabatic theory is not applicable .",
    "in particular the theory fails when the stellar oscillations can not be considered as small derivations from equilibrium .",
    "thus far only little investigation has been undertaken in this direction . for a rotating ,",
    "oscillating disk of dust there exists an analytic solution up to first post - newtonian order @xcite",
    ". a system of an rotating , osillating dusty disk and a point - mass object has been studied by the author in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "a so - called affine stellar model for polytropic , ellipsoidal configurations has been developed by carter and luminet @xcite . here",
    "the density contours in the star are assumed to form homologeous ellipsoids .",
    "the model allows for the discussion of arbitrary large amplitudes of the tidally generated oscillations , but fails to give accurate results for small oscillations .",
    "the excited mode roughly corresponds to the @xmath1-mode of the oscillations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "later on lai and shapiro extended this model to allow for the investigation of riemann - s binaries @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall follow the approach of lai and shapiro , pointing out some discrepancies in the authors formulation of the equations of motion as well as for the gravitational waveforms .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly recapitulate the lagrangian formulation of the dynamics of riemann - s binaries derived by lai and shapiro in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this model",
    "the stars are considered as rotating and oscillating triaxial ellipsoids with a polytropic equation of state . to keep the analysis as simple as possible , the tidal interaction potential is truncated",
    ", only the leading order ( i.e. quadrupole ) tidal interaction is taken into account .",
    "for later reasons we shall also present the hamiltonian formulation of this problem . in particular we shall specialize to axially symmetric polytropic stars in the equations of motions gives rise to divergent terms . ] .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the derivation of the leading order gravitational reaction terms appearing in the dynamical equations .",
    "we shall point out some discrepancies between our approach and the approach taken by lai and shapiro .",
    "the leading order gravitational waveforms are derived in section 4 .",
    "in particular we shall apply the quasi - static approximation to the internal stellar dynamics .",
    "the corresponding equations are derived for general triaxial riemann - s binaries , but for simplicity we restrict ourselves to axially symmetric configurations in the numerical calculations .",
    "the numerical results and some possible physical applications of our model are discussed in section 5 .",
    "in particular we study the influence of the polytropic index and hence of the equation of state on the dynamics as well as on the leading order gravitational waveforms .",
    "we shall show that the effect of the internal stellar structure on the long term evolution of the binary is quite significant .",
    "we argue that the exact knowledge of the polytropic equation of state is essential in order to calculate the leading order gravitational waveforms emitted by the binary system correctly .",
    "on newtonian order the lagrangian equations of motion for compressible riemann - s binaries have been derived by lai and shapiro in several papers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and we shall therefore only shortly recapitulate their strategy .",
    "we then turn our attention to the hamiltonian formulation of the problem which will be more suitable for numerical calculations .",
    "the case of axially symmetric , polytropic stars is of particular interest for us , but requires some special care in order not to overcount the degrees of freedom .",

    "the model is based on two assumptions : first , we shall require the vorticity to be uniform , and second , the surfaces of constant density inside the stars are assumed to form self - similar ellipsoids . in other words ,",
    "each star is described by only five degrees of freedom : the three semi - major axes @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , and the two angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are introduced in figure 1 .",
    "+ consider now an isolated star @xmath2 .",
    "if the assumptions given above are to be fullfilled , it is immediately clear that the fluid velocity in the body fixed system , which rotates with angular velocity @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with respect to an inertial system centered at @xmath2 , obeys the following ansatz : @xmath16 here @xmath17 are constants and @xmath18 denote coordinates in the body fixed frame .",
    "the second requirement yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vorticity in the body fixed frame and @xmath21 is the angular velocity of the internal fluidal motion . on the other hand ,",
    "observing the stellar matter in an inertial system centered at @xmath2 it s velocity is given by @xmath22 the rotational energy of the star reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant , which can be obtained from the lane - emden equation ( see appendix ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the inertial tensor @xmath25 in the body fixed system takes a very simple form , @xmath26 in particular , for @xmath27 the rotational energy reduces to @xmath28 the total kinetic energy of star @xmath2 is given by @xmath29 and the lagrangian @xmath30 of the star reads @xmath31 the gravitational self - energy @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , the internal energy of the star , have been computed by @xcite .",
