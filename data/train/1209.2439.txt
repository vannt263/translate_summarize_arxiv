    "@xcite ) . typically , that error is as large as the error deduced from the width of the maximum of the likelihood function .",
    "valid conclusions on agreement with rmt predictions can be drawn only if that error is properly taken into account in the data analysis .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the maximum - likelihood method as used in the analysis of neutron resonance data with a cutoff .",
    "section iii illustrates how the combination of applying a cutoff procedure to the data and finite - size - of - data effects can produce maximum - likelihood results that are very different from the underlying data . in section iv",

    "removes the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath0-wave neutron widths .",

    "cutoffs that depend both linearly  @xcite and non - linearly  @xcite on resonance energy have been employed .",
    "all measured neutron widths smaller than the cutoff were removed from the data set .",
    "the distribution of the remaining widths was then analyzed using a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method .",
    "the method tests for agreement with the porter - thomas distribution ( ptd ) predicted by rmt .",
    "the ptd is a @xmath6-distribution with a single degree of freedom ( @xmath7 ) . for comparison ,",

    "the probability density function for finding a width @xmath23 for a resonance with energy @xmath18 is then @xmath24 .    when the energy - dependent cutoff procedure is applied to a set of @xmath25 reduced widths , there remain @xmath26 included resonances with energies @xmath18 , @xmath27 and with reduced widths @xmath28 .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath29 is the product of the corresponding probabilities , @xmath30 the maximum of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath10 determines the most likely values of these parameters . the width of @xmath31 in the vicinity of the maximum determines the statistical significance with which a value of @xmath8 that differs from the value at the maximum , is rejected .",

    "the resulting weighted average of @xmath8 for the nde when the cutoff error is included is @xmath85 , as compared to the value @xmath86 listed in ref .",
    "even though the overall uncertainty is larger when @xmath79 is included in the analysis , the weighted average of @xmath8 has also increased so that the level of significance changes very little from the figure given in ref .",
    "most of the increase occurs because the overall uncertainty for the largest data set , @xmath87th , is increased by a relatively smaller amount than the other data sets , and the value of @xmath8 for these data is rather high . to put this in perspective , the weighted average of @xmath8 when @xmath87th is not included is @xmath88 , a value which does not show nearly as significant a difference from the rmt expectation of @xmath7",
    "it has been known for a long time that various eigenvalue statistics ( such as @xmath89  @xcite ) are extremely sensitive to missing or spurious levels .",
    "the effects of spurious or missing levels on the reduced - width distribution have not been nearly as well studied .",
    "koehler  @xcite has analyzed the reduced neutron widths in the nuclear data ensemble using a cutoff method to remove the smallest reduced widths , many of which probably belong to @xmath1-wave resonances .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure also carries the risk of removing small @xmath0-wave resonances that should be included in the data set .",
    "we have studied in detail how applying a constant cutoff affects the maximum - likelihood analysis of sets of theoretical and of computer - generated neutron widths generated from a ptd . expressing the condition for the maximum of the likelihood function @xmath31 in terms of two equations , we have investigated numerically the dependence of these two equations on the cutoff @xmath38 and on the number @xmath25 of resonance widths .",
    "we have found it convenient to represent the two equations graphically , their point of intersection giving the values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 that correspond to the maximum of @xmath31 .",
    "we have focused on a realistic cutoff value @xmath90 amounting to @xmath91 per cent of the mean value of all widths . for @xmath49 ,",
    "i.e. , in the absence of finite - size - of - data - errors , the cutoff rotates the two curves in such a way that they run almost parallel .",
    "therefore , any changes in the values of @xmath46 or of @xmath45 that occur for finite values of @xmath25 can cause significant shifts in the values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 that maximize the likelihood function @xmath29 .",
    "the rotation persists for finite values of @xmath25 but in addition each of the two curves is deformed , causing the wide scatter of solutions @xmath8 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for realistic cutoff values @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the full width at half maximum of both distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is about unity .",
    "we conclude that in realistic cases systematic errors ( due to the cutoff ) and finite - size - of - data errors ( due to the finite number @xmath25 of resonance widths experimentally available ) combine in such a way that the resulting error on @xmath8 is of order unity .",
    "we refer to the combination of both errors as the cutoff error .",

    "@xcite the overall error is significantly increased for every nucleus .",
    "the weighted average over all nuclei gives @xmath94 .",
    "as expected , the total error is larger than that obtained in ref .",
    "however , the mean value of @xmath8 is also increased in such a way that the significance of the deviation of @xmath8 from the rmt value remains nearly the same .",
    "we conclude that inclusion of the cutoff error does not remove the strong discrepancy ( first displayed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) between the distribution of neutron widths as predicted by rmt and the nde .",
