    "likewise , in superconducting rings the order parameter responds periodically to magnetic flux , as implied by the requirement of a single - valued superconducting wave function in the presence of a supercurrent @xcite",

    "this degeneracy is however lifted for discrete systems @xcite , which was implicitly understood already in the early works of byers and yang @xcite and by brenig @xcite .",
    "the lifting of the degeneracy can be made explicit through the evaluation of the supercurrent in sufficiently small rings @xcite .",
    "recently , nodal superconductors have been in the focus of research @xcite as they allow for striking differences in the excitation spectrum for flux sectors centered around integer and half integer @xmath4 values , respectively .    for rings of @xmath5-wave superconductors ,",
    "it is expected , that the @xmath0 periodicity is restored if , the ring diameter is smaller than the coherence length @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 periods are well understood in metallic and superconducting rings , it has remained unaddressed how the periodicity evolves for such a small ring when the normal metal turns superconducting .",

    "the gap equation for the current carrying superconducting state is solved for finite size rings to evaluate the field dependence of the discrete energy spectrum and the supercurrent .",
    "we identify two components of the current with @xmath0 and @xmath1 periodicity , respectively , whose magnitudes shift with the opening and increase of the energy gap in the superconducting state . when the coherence length of the superconducting ring is of the order of the ring size , only the @xmath1-periodic component remains .",
    "a similar analysis for the temperature driven crossover in clean and dirty 1@xmath6 rings has recently been published by wei and goldbart @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a long - range ordered superconducting state does not exist in 1@xmath6 . however , whereas thermal phase slips suppress a transition into the superconducting state at finite temperature , quantum phase slips at zero temperature are rare events . even if phase coherence is broken at certain instants in time and space , the supercurrent does not decay in the ring .",
