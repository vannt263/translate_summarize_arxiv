    "the non - parametric approach to statistics was introduced by @xcite via the method of permutation testing .",

    "many rank tests were developed for specific applications , such as the comparison of populations or testing hypotheses for determining the location of a population .",
    "the geometry of these tests was explored in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the search for patterns in large datasets has spurred the development and exploration of new tests .",

    "this application motivated us to develop a mathematical theory of rank tests .",
