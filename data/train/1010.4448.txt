    "as is well known , the yang - mills action needs to be gauge fixed in order to define the path integral .",
    "one way to do this is trough the gauge fixing proposed by faddeev and popov .",
    "however , as is shown by gribov , this gauge fixing suffers from gribov copies @xcite .",
    "if we take e.g.  the landau gauge , @xmath0 , it is very easy to show that there exist gauge equivalent fields @xmath1 also fulfilling the landau gauge @xmath2 when having zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator @xmath3 therefore , gribov proposed to restrict the region of integration to @xmath4 @xmath5 the region which is free of zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator @xmath6 .",
    "we should mention however , that there are still gribov copies inside the gribov region @xcite . in 1989 , zwanziger implemented this restriction to the gribov region to all orders : the gribov - zwanziger action was born @xcite .",
    "let us here immediately present the localized version of this action , namely @xmath7 with @xmath8 the usual faddeev - popov action , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 given by @xmath12 the fields @xmath13 are a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields , while @xmath14 are anticommuting fields .",
    "@xmath15 is not free , but fixed by a horizon condition , @xmath16 .",
    "looking at this horizon condition , we see that it is equivalent with a dimension two condensate .",
    "therefore , we could investigate other dimension two condensates , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 . including these condensates",
    "gives rise to the refined gz ( rgz ) action @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this can be done in a renormalizable way .",
    "we stress that the masses related to the condensates respectively @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dynamically generated .",
    "let us now look at the ghost and the gluon propagator .",
    "firstly , it is sure that perturbation theory fails in the infrared region as perturbatively , the gluon propagator blows up , while all lattice calculations show that there is infrared suppression .",
    "secondly , the gribov - zwanziger predicts a gluon propagator which is infrared suppressed , and therefore clearly goes beyond perturbation theory .",
    "unfortunately , at zero momentum , this gluon propagator vanishes , which contradicts the current numerical simulations that this propagator is non - vanishing at zero momentum @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ghost propagator shows infrared enhancement , which is also no longer observed in the infrared .",
    "therefore , something is still missing in the gz framework .",
    "thirdly , let us investigate the refined gz action . in this case , the tree level gluon propagator behaves like @xmath21 this propagator is clearly infrared suppressed , also violating positivity and is no longer zero at zero momentum .",
    "also the ghost propagator is no longer enhanced as an effect of the condensates .",
    "this agrees again qualitatively with the latest lattice results .",
    "+ in @xcite , we have investigated our specific form of the gluon propagator on the lattice .",
    "two main conclusions could be drawn : 1 ) if @xmath22 , the fits are of low quality , therefore , the condensate @xmath23 is indispensable ; 2 ) nice fits for the form were found when including the condensate @xmath24 .",
    "let us recall some estimates : @xmath25gev@xmath26 , @xmath27 gev@xmath26 and @xmath28 gev@xmath26 . from the estimate of @xmath20 , we find that @xmath29 which is in the same ballpark as other , rather independent , approaches @xcite . + in conclusion",
    ", we could state that the rgz framework provides a possible explanation of the behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagator .",
    "in fact , one can show that more condensates can be present , and alternative rgz frameworks exist @xcite .",
    "+ let us also stress that in 2d , the ghost propagator is still enhanced , while the gluon propagator is zero at zero momentum , @xcite .",
    "we have also provided evidence that in 2d , the gz formalism still holds the right results as refinement is impossible in 2d @xcite .",
    "now that the propagators match with the lattice , we can wonder whether the rgz also holds information about the particles of ( quenched ) qcd ?",
    "the idea to proceed is the following : we want to find an operator @xmath30 , so that the correlator @xmath31 can be put into a spectral representation : @xmath32 we then introduce @xmath33 so that when going to minkowski space , i.e. @xmath34 , we find a discontinuity along the positive real axis . in addition",
    "we want @xmath35 to be positive for @xmath36 in order to give a particle interpretation to the correlator is proportional to the cross section , and thus has to be positive . ] and obviously @xmath37 has to be renormalizable .",
    "+ we have worked out two different angles to attack this problem . in the first approach , we have introduced @xmath38-particles @xcite @xmath39 to make the quadratic part of the action diagonal . with the @xmath38-field strengths , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we have proposed the following operator @xmath42 the corresponding correlator @xmath43 can be put in a spectral representation : @xmath44 whereby @xmath45 .",
    "unfortunately , the operator @xmath46 is not renormalizable .",
    "+ let us therefore also discuss the second angle . in @xcite , we have investigated the renormalization of the typical scalar glueball operator @xmath47 with the gz action .",
    "let us start by noting that the faddeev - popov action @xmath48 is invariant under the brst transformation @xmath49 : @xmath50 , @xmath51 this brst invariance lies at the origin of the slavnov - taylor identity , which allows us to prove the renormalizability .",
    "moreover , the brst charge allows us to define the sub - space of the physical states and to establish the unitarity of the @xmath52 matrix .",
    "unfortunately , the gz action is no longer invariant under the brst transformation @xmath49 .",
    "the new fields transform as @xmath53 and thus the breaking is proportional to @xmath15 , @xmath54 . despite this breaking ,",
    "the gz action is still renormalizable , due to a rich set of ward identities .",
    "moreover , only two renormalization constants are needed , which is the same as in the yang - mills theory .",
    "let us also mention that by introducing extra fields , a symmetry can be restored again @xcite . with the breaking in mind",
    ", we can renormalize @xmath47 within the gz framework as done in @xcite .",
    "this renormalization is however far from trivial due to the breaking of the brst symmetry .",
    "we find that @xmath47 mixes with the following operator : @xmath55 moreover , we have constructed a renormalization group invariant given by @xmath56 therefore , we would propose the following correlator @xmath57(x )    \\left [ \\frac { \\beta } { g^2 } f^2   -2 \\gamma_c",
    "\\mathcal e \\right](y ) } \\nonumber\\\\                                   & \\not= \\left ( \\frac { \\beta } { g^2}\\right)^2 \\braket {   f^2(x ) f^2(y ) } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the breaking of the brst symmetry is the reason that this correlator contains extra terms beside @xmath58 . in ordinary yang - mills theory , a similar correlator can be found , but it reduces the @xmath59 due to the presence of the brst symmetry . unfortunately , with this correlator , we are unable to find a good spectral representation .",
    "this was already found in @xcite : @xmath60 whereby the unphysical part , @xmath61 , displays cuts along the imaginary axes beginning at the unphysical values @xmath62 and the physical part , @xmath63 , has a cut beginning at the physical threshold @xmath64 .",
    "+   + for further clarification , let us show the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . at lowest order",
    ", we have that @xmath67 and thus it are in fact the two last terms which cause the bad spectral representation in @xmath59 , and the question remains how we can find a renormalizable operator with a good spectral representation .",
    "+ we can already mention that so far , we have only investigated spectral representations within the gz framework .",
    "the hope is that within the rgz framework , we can still find an operator with the required properties as some aspects change of the analysis .",
    "also , the study of glueballs looks very promising within the ( r)gz framework , see , for example , the recent results in @xcite .",
    "this question of finding descent operators is not only relevant within the gribov - zwanziger context , but for all people involved in infrared propagators qcd . how to find good spectral operators starting from unphysical operators ?",
