    "macromolecules with a comb - like chemical architecture , where flexible side chains are densely grafted to a ( also flexible ) polymer acting as `` backbone '' have found abiding current interest , see , e.g. , the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "these so - called `` bottle - brush polymers '' exhibit an interesting competition due to the steric repulsion between the side chains and the configurational entropy of the backbone : varying the grafting density of the side chains and their length , the effective stiffness of these cylindrical brushes can be controlled over a wide range . since the overall conformation of the bottle - brush polymer is sensitive to external stimuli such as solvent quality , ph value and ionic strength of the solution , or temperature , electromagnetic fields , various possible applications of these bottle - brush polymers have been discussed ( actuators , sensors , building blocks of new nanostructures or templates for producing metallic nano - wires .",
    "a fascinating aspect is also the importance of biomolecules with bottle - brush architecture , such as proteoglycans @xcite ( polyelectrolytes consisting of a protein backbone and carbohydrate side chains , performing biological functions from cell signaling and cell surface protection to joint lubrication @xcite ) .",
    "of course , under many circumstances these functions of bottle - brushes occur when they are attached to a substrate surface ( e.g. a cell membrane in a biological context , or an inorganic flat solid surface for nano - technological applications , including also special surface coatings @xcite ) .",
    "bottle - brush molecules attached to surfaces are also of particular interest , since additional experimental tools become available to study their structure ( e.g. , one can directly visualize their large - scale conformation by scanning force microscopy @xcite , or one can use atomic force microscopes to measure force vs. extension curves @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while rich information on the structure of bottle - brush polymers at surfaces already is available @xcite , it is not so clear which of these features are intrinsic properties of these complex macromolecules , and which features are only induced by their adsorption to the substrate .",
    "we recall that basic aspects of bottle - brush polymers in dilute solution away from any constraining surfaces are still incompletely understood ( e.g. the relation between the persistence length of these macromolecules and their microscopic characteristics such as side - chain and backbone chain lengths @xmath3 and @xmath0 has been controversial , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are already some indications from theoretical work @xcite that strongly adsorbed bottle - brushes exhibit properties different from the bulk .",
    "thus the present paper intends to contribute to a clarification of this problem , by presenting a comprehensive computer simulation study of ( large ) bottle - brush polymers near surfaces , over the full range extending from a repulsive surface ( applying only the constraint that one backbone chain end is grafted to this surface ) through the region of the adsorption transition , where the overall conformation of the macromolecule changes from a three - dimensional `` mushroom '' to a quasi - two - dimensional `` pancake '' , to the strongly adsorbed almost two - dimensional case . using side chain lengths up to @xmath5 we",
    "ensure that statistical concepts of theoretical polymer physics @xcite start to become applicable @xcite , and we also note that our range of side chain lengths can be nicely mapped to experiments @xcite . while the adsorption transition of flexible linear chains has been studied extensively by various theoretical methods @xcite ,",
    "the present work is the first one to present large - scale simulations on the adsorption of bottle - brush polymers . clearly , the interplay of the conformational changes due to adsorption with the chain stiffness ( tunable via the side chain length variation ) is of particular interest @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : section ii describes the model and the simulation techniques while section iii presents the numerical results .",
    "section iv gives a summary and an outlook on both pertinent experimental work and on open questions .",
    "the bond fluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice @xcite has been extended in previous work to simulate bottle - brush polymers in dilute solution under good solvent conditions @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we extend these studies to bottle - brush polymers tethered with one chain end of their backbone to a flat impenetrable surface , which is chosen to be the xy - plane ( z = 0 ) of the lattice . besides the excluded volume interactions between the monomers of the side chains and/or the backbone chain , and the infinitely repulsive interaction between monomers and the grafting surfaces ( which prevents that monomers can occur with z - coordinates @xmath12 in the system ) , we also consider the effect of an additional attractive short range interaction @xmath7 between the grafting surface and the monomers of the bottle - brush polymer . recall that in the bond fluctuation model each effective monomer blocks all 8 sites at the corners of an elementary cube of the lattice from further occupation .",
    "thus , an energy @xmath7 is won if 4 sites of such a cube are in plane @xmath13 , while the remaining 4 sites of the cube then have to be in the adjacent plane @xmath14 ( note that we use the lattice spacing as the unit of length ) .",
    "the bond vectors connecting two adjacent monomers along a chain are chosen from the set \\{[2,0,0 ] , [ 2,1,0 ] , [ 2,1,1 ] , [ 2,2,1 ] , [ 3,0,0 ] , and [ 3,1,0 ] } , including also all possible rotations , reflections and reversions of these bond vectors .",
    "we use the same set of bond vectors , irrespective of whether we consider side chains of the bottle - brush or the backbone chain . note that this model is one of the standard models used for monte carlo simulation of macromolecular systems , many physical properties of polymers",
    "are rather well accounted for , and very efficient simulation algorithms can be formulated for this model @xcite .",
    "the chemical architecture of a bottle - brush polymer is arranged such that at a backbone monomer that acts as a grafting site one side chain is anchored , and the chemical distance ( i.e. , difference in the consecutive labels of the backbone monomers ) is the inverse of the grafting density , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , only integer numbers @xmath15 are possible , and side - chains are anchored at regular chemical distances . note that both next to the first grafting site and next to the last grafting site of the backbone we add one extra backbone monomer .",
    "thus if we have @xmath16 side chains , the total number of monomers in the backbone is @xmath17 + 2 $ ] , and the total number of monomers in the bottle - brush then is @xmath18 , when @xmath3 denotes the number of monomers per side chain .",
    "now , we also require that one of the two extra monomers at a chain end of the backbone is attached to the adsorbing surface at @xmath13 , and hence our simulation deals with a `` bottle - brush mushroom '' ( recall that an isolated polymer chain @xcite , end - grafted to a planar surface traditionally is called a `` polymer mushroom '' , and we extend this nomenclature to bottle - brushes ) . in the present work ,",
    "only @xmath6 is considered .",
    "the initial configuration of the bottle - brush polymer is constructed by assuming that the structures of the backbone chain and of the side chains are both rod - like .",
    "namely , the backbone is oriented in the direction along the + z - direction , setting all bond vectors between monomers equal to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a unit vector along the z - axis .",
    "the bond vectors between monomers on each side chain are chosen randomly from one of the allowed bond vectors in the x - y plane .",
    "this initial configuration , of course , is very far from equilibrium , and needs to be carefully relaxed towards equilibrium in the first part of the monte carlo run .    in order to speed up the dynamics of the model",
    ", we do not move the monomers from their previous positions to only one of the six nearest neighbor sites of the monomer , as is traditionally done , but allow attempts to move a monomer to one of the 26 sites surrounding the current position of the monomer .",
    "this `` l26 move '' allows bonds to cross each other and has been shown to yield a significant speedup of the algorithm in comparison with the standard `` l6 '' move @xcite .",
    "in addition to the local moves , the pivot algorithm @xcite is employed in the following ways : ( a ) a monomer on the backbone is chosen randomly and the part of the bottle - brush polymer containing the free end of the backbone is exposed to a trial move , by randomly choosing one operation from the 48 symmetry operations of the lattice ( no change , rotations by @xmath21 and @xmath22 angles , reflections , and inversions ) .",
    "of course , the trial configuration is accepted as a new configuration only , if it does not violate any excluded volume constraints and if it passes the metropolis acceptance test ( where the change in adsorption energy enters ) . the same is true for the attempted `` l26 '' moves , of course .",
    "( b ) a monomer is chosen randomly from the monomers on all side chains , and the trial move is effected by transforming the part of the side chain from the selected monomer to the free end by one of the same 48 symmetry operations as mentioned above .",
    "a monte carlo step ( mcs ) in our simulation then consists of a sequence of @xmath23 `` l26 '' moves ( each monomer on average is attempted to be moved once ) , @xmath24 pivot moves of choosing a backbone monomer randomly , and @xmath25 pivot moves of choosing a side chain monomer randomly .",
    "we set @xmath26 and adjusted @xmath24 such that the acceptance ratio was about 30 % to 40% for small values of @xmath7 .",
    "however , when a bottle - brush polymer becomes strongly adsorbed to the surface successful pivot moves are more difficult . to avoid the problem that in the regime of the strong adsorption the bottle - brush configurations are frozen , 16 to 512 different equilibrium configurations are generated as initial configurations for the start of monte carlo simulations in equilibrium . during the equilibration process , the convergence of the time series for the energy and the gyration radius components of the bottle - brush polymer are monitored . for the measurements at each parameter set in total about 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath28 statistically independent configurations",
    "were generated .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows typical snapshot pictures of such configurations for 4 choices of @xmath7 .",
    "when a single flexible polymer chain of chain length @xmath0 tethered with one end to a flat impenetrable surface experiences an energy @xmath7 that monomers win when they are adjacent to the surface , a transition of this `` polymer mushroom '' occurs from an essentially three - dimensional configuration to a quasi - two - dimensional `` pancake '' configuration when the adsorption energy exceeds a critical value @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this transition is a second order transition , involving a nontrivial exponent @xmath29 ( the `` crossover exponent '' @xcite ) such that the fraction of monomer - surface contacts @xmath30 behaves as ( in the limit @xmath8 ) @xcite    @xmath31    despite a lot of effort ( see @xcite and references therein ) the value of the ( universal ) exponent @xmath29 is not yet very precisely known , some estimates being compatible with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , the most recent estimate from monte carlo simulations of the bond fluctuation model yielded  @xcite @xmath33 , a value close to the early estimate  @xcite @xmath34 .",
    "this adsorption transition also shows up in the chain linear dimensions , of course .",
    "while for @xmath35 all linear dimensions are of the same order @xcite @xmath36 for @xmath37 the perpendicular component of the gyration radius ( related to the thickness of the `` pancake '' configuration ) remains finite @xcite , @xmath38 while the parallel component exhibits a scaling compatible with two - dimensional self - avoiding walks @xcite , @xmath39 hence when one plots the ratio @xmath40 vs. @xmath7 for several finite large values of @xmath0 , one should see a family of curves which exhibit an intersection point for @xmath41 .",
    "motivated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , we plot the fraction of monomer - surface contacts @xmath42 versus @xmath7 ( fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) , @xmath23 being the total number of effective monomers in the bottle - brush polymer , as well as the ratio @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "inspection of these `` raw data '' ( figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] ) already indicates that the adsorption transition occurs near @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig034 ] , a close view of the ratio @xmath40 in the vicinity of @xmath44 ) ; if @xmath45 depends at all on side chain length @xmath3 , the dependence is rather weak .",
    "however , it is remarkable that @xmath42 increases for @xmath46 clearly much faster for the linear chains @xmath47 than for the bottle - brush polymers ; @xmath42 seems to converge to a limiting function for large @xmath3 that is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the ratio @xmath48 varies more steeply the larger @xmath3 , and there is no universal behavior ; in particular , in the non - adsorbing regime @xmath40 increases monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is plausible , since the longer the side chains are the more the excluded volume interaction with the planar substrate surface is felt .            of course , it would be desirable to extract more precise estimates of @xmath45 from a scaling analysis of the data , similar to the scaling analysis done in refs .  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as explained in the appendix , no significant gain in accuracy in comparison with the simple intersection method of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) could be gotten .",
    "an obvious question with respect to the adsorption transition of bottle - brush polymers is the clarification whether the behavior of the side chains and of the backbone is fully analogous , or whether some characteristic differences occur .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] disentangles in both the fraction of adsorbed monomers and in the ratio @xmath40 the contributions of the backbone from the contributions of the side chains .",
    "one sees remarkable differences between the behavior of the side chains and the backbone : while the ratio @xmath49 is essentially constant for @xmath50 and then decreases only rather gradually ( almost linearly ) , the ratio @xmath51 shows most of its decrease before @xmath52 is reached . on the other hand , for large @xmath3",
    "a significant rise of @xmath53 only starts at about @xmath54 .",
    "some aspects of this behavior can be attributed to the fact that in the adsorption of bottle - brushes it easily happens that the monomer density in the layer adjacent to the adsorbing wall gets rather high , thus there is not enough empty space in this layer to allow for the adsorption of all the side - chain monomers .",
    "since some of the side chains near the backbone chain end which is grafted to the substrate surface necessarily are rather close to the adsorbing surface , while this is not true for the side chains in the vicinity of its free ends , it also is interesting to resolve the side - chain properties as a function of their position along the backbone ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the linear dimensions of the side chains near to the grafted backbone chain end are strongly reduced for non - adsorbed chains , while an analogous effect near the free backbone end is much smaller .",
    "no such asymmetry can occur for free bottle - brush polymers in bulk solution , of course , since there both backbone chain ends are strictly equivalent .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that this asymmetry effect vanishes almost completely when the bottle - brush polymer gets adsorbed : then also the free chain end of the backbone is close to the surface , and it does not matter whether it actually would be grafted or not .",
    "a similar asymmetry is found , however , when one considers the mean square end - to - end distance of the side chains parallel to the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) : of course , then the magnitude of @xmath55 strongly increases with @xmath7 , unlike @xmath56 , due to the tendency of the adsorbed polymers to form `` pancake '' conformations , cf",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) , and therefore these ratios systematically increase with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "similar observations can be made when one studies the mean square gyration radius components ( figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "thus , if one would normalize the data for @xmath57 with @xmath58 with @xmath59 instead of @xmath60 with @xmath61 , as done in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one finds plateau values for @xmath62 in the center of the bottle - brush @xmath63 at about @xmath64 for n = 6 and at about @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "these values are of the same order as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath67 , where the side chains still take the configuration of three - dimensional coils .",
    "of course , side chain lengths @xmath68 , as studied here , are too short to reveal the asymptotic behavior @xmath69 in the regime @xmath70 clearly .",
    "a rather unexpected feature , however , emerges when we examine the variation of the radii with @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . the side chain linear dimensions are almost independent of @xmath0 for @xmath71 .",
    "the adsorbtion process for @xmath72 , however , seems to be an @xmath3-dependent two - step process : first a rather rapid decrease of @xmath73 ( and a rather rapid increase of @xmath74 ) occurs , and the behavior for all three values of @xmath3 is rather similar ; then , near @xmath75 , the behavior changes , and the further variation depends distinctly on @xmath3 and for @xmath73 and @xmath76 even is non - monotonic .",
    "near @xmath77 the three sets of curves intersect each other .",
    "we speculate that for @xmath78 the adsorption is controlled by the side chains near the grafted end of the backbone while for @xmath79 it is controlled by all the side chains and the backbone , but clearly this point needs further study .",
    "of course , @xmath73 can be considered as a measure of the thickness of the `` pancake '' .",
    "alternative information on this thickness can be obtained when one simply studies the monomer density profile @xmath80 , which again can also be resolved distinguishing contributions from the backbone only , from the side chains only , or even from the free chain ends of the side chains only ( figs .",
    "[ fig9]-[fig13 ] ) .    while for @xmath4 the monomer distribution of the bottle - brush as a whole for the non - adsorbed bottle - brush mushroom as well as the distribution of the backbone and the side chain monomers are very similar to each other and similar to corresponding data for simple non - adsorbed polymer mushrooms , the distribution gets a more complicated shape the longer the side chain length @xmath3 becomes .",
    "the strong shift of the maximum of all distributions with increasing @xmath3 to larger @xmath81 clearly can be attributed to the increasing backbone stiffness and the corresponding increase of the linear dimensions of the bottle - brush .",
    "when now the adsorption energy is switched on , the distributions show little change for @xmath82 ( not shown ) , while near the adsorption transition a profound change of the character of the distribution has occurred ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) : all distributions now exhibit a second maximum near the surface , for large enough @xmath3 , and also the main maximum occurs now much closer to the adsorbing surface ( but its position @xmath83 strongly increases with @xmath3 , presumably because the bottle - brush needs to avoid `` crowding '' of monomers near the adsorbing surface ) . in the adsorbed regime ( figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] ) one observes layering type oscillations near the wall , similar to the behavior of off - lattice models for fluids close to hard walls . while the backbone monomers still have a pronounced maximum in @xmath80 away from the surface , fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) the corresponding results for the side - chain monomers do not show this maximum any more .",
    "this observation corroborates our interpretation of the non - monotonic variation of @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , namely that adsorption occurs in two steps - first the adsorption of the monomers near the grafted end of the backbone takes place , while the adsorption transition of the rest of the bottle - brush is not yet completed at @xmath84 for the side chain lengths @xmath3 studied here . for @xmath85 , on the other hand , all profiles show only very little dependence on the side chain length ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) : the lengths of still non - adsorbed `` tails '' and `` loops '' @xcite then are rather short , and therefore the side chain length no longer is important .    from the profiles , one can easily estimate the average thickness @xmath86 defined as @xmath87 , and study its dependence on @xmath7 ( fig .  [ fig14 ] ) . again the two - step character of adsorption for long enough side - chains @xmath88 is very clearly seen .    as a final point of this study",
    ", we address the scattering function @xmath11 where the orientation of the wave vector @xmath89 has been averaged over . hence @xmath90 \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the total number of monomers , from which the scattering is considered , and the average @xmath92 includes both a statistical average over the conformations of the bottle - brush and a spherical average over the direction of @xmath89 .",
    "a distinctive advantage of the simulation is that the scattering from the total bottle - brush , the scattering only from the backbone , or only from the side chains are easily accessible .",
    "[ fig15 ] correspondingly compares data for @xmath11 considering the total scattering from all the monomers of the bottle - brush , comparing data for 4 choices of @xmath3 and 3 choices of @xmath0 , as indicated , and including data for both @xmath93 and @xmath62 .",
    "while the data for @xmath93 closely resemble the scattering function of isolated bottle - brush polymers in dilute bulk solution , as studied previously , revealing a law @xmath94 for small @xmath3 and intermediate @xmath95 , and a rod - like behavior @xmath96 for large @xmath95 , for the strongly adsorbed case @xmath97 for large @xmath95 the rod - like behavior is not seen for @xmath76 and @xmath5 , rather one finds in the decade @xmath98 a behavior proportional to @xmath99 : the side chains in the strongly adsorbed case behave like two - dimensional self - avoiding walks : since there so many more monomers occur in the side chains than in the backbone , the rod - like characteristics of the latter is only revealed when one focuses on the scattering from the backbone only ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "then one can clearly see two crossovers , @xmath100 at small @xmath95 of order @xmath101 crosses over to @xmath102 in @xmath103 and to @xmath104 in @xmath105 dimensions , while near @xmath106 a crossover to @xmath107 occurs , both for adsorbed and for non - adsorbed bottle - brushes .",
    "in this paper a monte carlo simulation study of the adsorption of bottle - brush mushrooms  ( i.e. bottle - brush polymers with a backbone chain end grafted to a flat structureless impenetrable surface ) has been presented , using the bond - fluctuation model and assuming very good solvent conditions . the same range of backbone chain lengths @xmath108 and side chain lengths @xmath109 as used in a previous study of the same model in dilute solution in the bulk",
    "@xcite has been used , since evidence has been presented that this range is fully appropriate to allow a comparison with experiment @xcite .",
    "every backbone monomer carries one side chain .",
    "both the backbone chain and the side chains are assumed to be fully flexible , and a short range attractive energy @xmath7 ( putting temperature @xmath110 throughout ) is assumed that attracts both monomers of the side chains and of the backbone to the surface in the same way .",
    "we show that near @xmath111 the mushrooms cross over from a three - dimensional configuration ( for @xmath112 ) to the adsorbed , quasi - two - dimensional configuration for @xmath113 .",
    "these transitions occur roughly at the same value of @xmath114 irrespective of @xmath3 , but the latter has a pronounced effect deeper in the adsorbed region , where chain linear dimensions reveal a two - step adsorption process ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "we tentatively associate the first step of the adsorption ( near @xmath9 ) to the side chains near the grafted end of the backbone , while the backbone as a whole for @xmath7 not much larger than @xmath9 exhibits only a very small fraction @xmath115 of adsorbed monomers ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "thus , most of the backbone monomers still occur in the tail or in rather long loops stretching away from the adsorbing surface . only at somewhat larger values of @xmath7 ( namely for @xmath116 in our case )",
    "the `` trains '' @xcite of consecutively adsorbed backbone monomers get longer and more frequent , and the tail and the loops get correspondingly shorter .",
    "this behavior must cause an interesting interplay with the behavior of the side chains : a side chain grafted to a backbone monomer that is part of an adsorbed `` train '' behaves basically like a small mushroom , and hence such a side chain gets easily adsorbed .",
    "however , side chains grafted to a backbone monomer that belongs to the tail or to a large loop can not yet get adsorbed easily , simply because typically the grafting site of this side chain is not close enough to the adsorbing surface",
    ". however , when @xmath7 increases and the loops in the backbone would get smaller , the grafting site gets close to the adsorbing surface , and then the side chain easily can adsorb ( and if it is long enough , the side chain adsorption will have a kind of feedback effect on the backbone , dragging the remaining part of the non - adsorbed loop towards the surface as well ) . clearly , this picture is qualitative and somewhat speculative , but it suggests that through a cooperative interplay of side chains and backbone a much more intricate behavior is possible than for the adsorption of linear polymers .",
    "one can even speculate that due to the strong crowding effects upon adsorption , occurring especially for long side chains , a complete adsorption of the bottle - brush can not occur from a configuration where both ends are already adsorbed and a train is still present in the interior of the polymer .",
    "rather the adsorbed part towards the free end of the backbone would have do desorb again first and then the complete adsorption proceeds in a zipper - like fashion starting from the grafted chain end . of course , development of an analytical model that could describe data such as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig14 ] would be highly desirable .",
    "we have also verified that strongly adsorbed bottle - brush polymers exhibit lateral linear dimensions that scale with the exponent @xmath117 of two - dimensional self - avoiding walks , and in the scattering function of the total bottle - brush this behavior is seen as well ( fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) .",
    "however , the expected rod - like behavior on intermediate length scales is only seen when the scattering from the backbone is isolated ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "our data also imply rather different structures of adsorbed vs. non - adsorbed bottle - brush polymers making it difficult to reason from adsorbed structures on the behavior of free bottle - brushes in solution ! we emphasize this simple point , as a warning to premature interpretations of corresponding experiments .",
    "our study reveals many details ( bimodal behavior of the density distribution @xmath80 of the monomers as a function of distance from the surface near adsorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) , characteristic effects due to the backbone chain ends ( figs .  [ fig4 ] - [ fig7 ] ) , etc . , which all reflect in some way the interplay between the enthalpy won by adsorbing monomers , and various entropic effects .",
    "more work is clearly required to clarify the reasons for these detailed observations . also , it would be very interesting to clarify the nature of the cross - sectional structure of the adsorbed bottle - brush on a coarse - grained scale ( in the bulk , the bottle - brush can be viewed as a more or less flexible cylinder : should we view the cross section of an adsorbed bottle brush as a sphere cap rather than a sphere ? )",
    "a further interesting aspect is the question of the persistence length of adsorbed bottle - brushes @xcite , and its relation to the persistence length of bottle - brushes in the bulk .",
    "other interesting issues concern the effect of solvent quality  @xcite and possible irreversibility effects in the adsorption of the side arms  @xcite .",
    "our study only considers adsorption under very good solvent conditions .",
    "it also is a very interesting problem ( and relevant for experiment ) to consider adsorption under poor solvent conditions where much more compact  pancake \" structures should result  @xcite rather than the configurations obtained here , that resemble two dimensional self - avoiding walks .",
    "finally , we mention the possibility that for strong adsorption @xmath118 the left - right distribution of the side chains with respect to the backbone is quenched , i.e. , random fluctuations in this distribution have not enough time to relax .",
    "such effects are predicted to have interesting effects on the conformation of such strongly adsorbed bottle - brush polymers  @xcite .",
    "we intend to study some of these issues in forthcoming work .",

    "the statement of scaling is that quantities such as the fraction @xmath30 of adsorbed monomers do not depend on the two variables @xmath0 , @xmath119 in the most general way , but are essentially a function of a simple scaling variable , @xmath120 , apart from a power law prefactor . thus @xmath121 the power laws quoted in the main text \\{eq .",

[ figa1]-[figa4 ] show some typical attempts to do this with our data ( each figure has four parts to show the results for the four side chain lengths @xmath10 ( no side chains ) , @xmath4 , @xmath142 , and @xmath76 , respectively ) . here",
    "we have used as a further constraint the  universality principle \" , namely the crossover exponent @xmath29 should be a universal constant , independent of irrelevant microscopic details such as the length @xmath3 of the side chains ( as long as @xmath3 is finite , while the limit @xmath8 is considered ) .",
    "note also that the ratio @xmath143 according to eq .",
    "( [ eqa2 ] ) should be a function of @xmath144 alone , and plotted vs. @xmath7 should have a unique intersection point at @xmath9 .",
    "( however , as shown in fig .  [ fig034 ] , one would need data for larger @xmath0 and very good statistical accuracy to show this ) .",
    "the straight lines included in these log - log plots of the resulting estimates for the scaling functions that they must converge to for @xmath145 yield the power laws quoted in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eq4 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath146 and @xmath147 is independently known , it is again only the exponent @xmath29 ( as in the scaling variable @xmath148 ) which matters . to simplify matters , we only present the two extreme choices for @xmath29 here : the estimate @xmath149 ( which happens to coincide with the crossover exponent for adsorption of gaussian chains  @xcite , but is supported by a renormalization group estimation  @xcite and some monte carlo studies  @xcite ) and the most recent estimate @xmath33 from monte carlo studies  @xcite .",
    "comparison of figs  [ figa1 ] , [ figa2 ] for @xmath150 shows that we confirm the finding of descas et .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath33 yields a slightly better data collapse on the master curve @xmath139 , @xmath45 being always chosen such that for @xmath151 the master curve has the correct slope .",
    "for @xmath70 the data for large @xmath144 fall systematically somewhat below the expected power law , if @xmath149 is chosen .",
    "however , as a caveat we mention that for finite @xmath0 the data are not expected to follow the master curve for very large @xmath144 , since @xmath152 ( for the case @xmath10 and large enough @xmath7 , where the chain is adsorbed in a two dimensional configuration ) .",
    "so , it must happen that for large @xmath144 the curves bend away from the power law that describe the asymptotic limit of the scaling function , and this  saturation effect \" occurs the later the larger @xmath0 is , and this is exactly what one sees in fig .",
    "[ figa1](a ) , while in fig .",
    "[ figa2 ] ( a ) the same effect is somewhat less pronounced .",
    "however , in our opinion the evidence from these plots that @xmath33 is  better \" than @xmath153 is somewhat weak , and much longer chains would be needed to reach a really firm conclusions .    when one chooses @xmath153 , the resulting estimates for @xmath45 would be @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , for side chain lengths @xmath10 , 6 , 12 , 24 , respectively . when one chooses @xmath33 , on the other hand , most of the estimate are a little bit larger , namely 1.00 , 1.03 , 1.05 , and 1.00 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the best estimates for @xmath29 and @xmath45 are correlated .",
    "however , it must be admitted that slightly different choices of @xmath45 than those that are shown here yield a data collapse that is only slightly worse .",
    "given the fact that eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eq4 ] ) and ( [ eqa1])-([eqa3 ] ) are only asymptotically valid in the double limit @xmath126 and @xmath8 , while for finite @xmath0 and finite nonzero @xmath158 corrections to scaling may be present , a reliable judgment of accuracy for the estimates @xmath45 is difficult .",
    "for this reason , we have quoted @xmath159 as an estimate for all choices of @xmath3 studied in the main text .",
    "in fact , the estimation is not really improved when one considers the scaling of the mean square gyration radius ( figs .",
    "[ figa3 ] , [ figa4 ] ) . for @xmath10 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the quality of the data collapse for @xmath153 and @xmath33 is of comparable quality . for @xmath142 and @xmath76",
    ", scaling seems to work well only for large @xmath144 , not for small @xmath144 , indicating clearly a more complex behavior right at the adsorption transition .",
    "the data show that the choices for @xmath45 quoted above are compatible with the behavior of the chain dimensions too , at least roughly .",
    "the result that the addition of side chains ( that are still short , of course ) has so little effect on the location of the adsorption transition clearly is surprising and unexpected .",
    "therefore we have presented in this appendix our evidence for this fact in some detail , not withstanding the uncertainty about the best value of the crossover exponent ; this problem is not solved by our analysis .",

    "<S> the adsorption of a bottle - brush polymer end - grafted with one chain end of its backbone to a flat substrate surface is studied by monte carlo simulation of a coarse - grained model , that previously has been characterized in the bulk , assuming a dilute solution under good solvent conditions . applying the bond fluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice , we vary the backbone chain length @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 effective monomeric units , the side chain length @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and the grafting density @xmath6 , i.e. , parameters that correspond well to the experimentally accessible range . when the adsorption energy strength @xmath7 is varied , we find that the adsorption transition ( which becomes well - defined in the limit @xmath8 , for arbitrary finite @xmath3 ) roughly occurs at the same value @xmath9 as for ordinary linear chains ( @xmath10 ) , at least within our statistical errors </S>",
    "<S> . mean square end - to - end distances and gyration radii of the side chains are obtained , as well as the monomer density profile in the direction perpendicular to the adsorbing surface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for longer side chains the adsorption of bottle - brushes is a two step process , the decrease of the perpendicular linear dimension of side chains with adsorption energy strength can even be non - monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> also the behavior of the static structure factor @xmath11 is analyzed , evidence for a quasi - two - dimensional scaling is presented , and consequences for the interpretation of experiments are discussed . </S>"
