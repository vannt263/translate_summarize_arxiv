    "discrete symmetries have been used extensively in models of fermion masses for several years now ( for an extensive list of references please see  @xcite ) .",
    "the finiteness in their number of representations lets one imagine the possibility of a predictive scenario .",
    "their actual implementation into a realistic model , however , usually comes with a plethora of assumptions and additions to the standard model ( sm ) that , depending on the specific setup and ambition , may or not be experimentally testable .    the recent results on neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences have given more impetus to the flavor model builders , particularly the observation that the neutrino mixing angles closely match the so - called tribimaximal mixing  @xcite .",
    "this observation alone has led to a close analysis on the symmetry properties needed ( inherent ) in the lepton sector  @xcite . among the most popular - and prolific - groups explored in this regard",
    "is @xmath1 , the group of even permutations on four elements ( same as @xmath2 , the group of orientation - preserving symmetries of a tetrahedron )  @xcite .",
    "it is not a settled matter whether or not quarks and leptons are both touched by the same flavor symmetry . on the one hand",
    "the _ unexpected _ maximality in the neutrino mixing sector  , compared to the hierarchical and small mixing observed in the quark sector , could be an indication that they should be treated independently .",
    "on the other hand models that incorporate a single symmetry in both sectors do exist and thus , from a model building perspective , it is certainly possible to have both sectors connected through a single flavor symmetry .",
    "this last possibility can also be motivated in grand unified scenarios .",
    "models in this category contain a large number of additional fields to those of the sm ( or other frameworks such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , grand unified theories ( guts ) , etc . ) .",
    "most of these new additional fields are scalar fields needed to break the flavor symmetry and/or to generate hierarchies through ratios of their vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to high energy flavor scales . in most cases these so - called flavon fields",
    "are taken to be heavy and do not lead to detectable phenomenology ( for a study of possible flavon effects at the lhc see  @xcite ) . a possible alternative to this situation is provided by renormalizable flavor models in which the scalars responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) are also charged under the flavor symmetry  @xcite . in such a scenario",
    "the scalar fields may have significant phenomenology at accessible energy scales .",
    "neutrino mass generation plays an important role on both approaches .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses has to be attributed to some additional mechanism that must be incorporated into the models , the seesaw being the most popular and perhaps successful  @xcite .",
    "the end result is the need to add more scalars and/or energy scales . in some renormalizable models non - renormalizable operators",
    "are introduced to generate neutrino masses and this requires also the introduction of some high energy scale ( without the introduction of right - handed neutrinos ) . as a side note",
    "we mention that for models with right - handed neutrinos , there has been a recent interest in the possibility of lowering down the scale associated to neutrino mass generation close to the electroweak ( ew ) scale and thus , perhaps , make it accessible to experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "see  @xcite for an incomplete list of examples .",
    "the two general approaches described above are then useful and have led to interesting possibilities . if one is interested in explaining the observed hierarchies in the masses without assuming a hierarchical structure for the yukawa couplings , then the first ( flavon based ) approach seems appropriate at the expense of introducing high energy - unobservable - scales .",
    "if one is instead interested in the possibility of accessing the phenomenology associated to a possible flavor model , then the second approach may seem more appropriate - at the expense of assuming hierarchical couplings .",
    "nothing is for free .",
    "as mentioned above , one of the attractive features of renormalizable models is that the su(2 ) doublet scalar fields transform non - trivially ( at least some of them ) under the flavor symmetry and this can , in principle , be reflected phenomenologically .",
    "most models however require a large number of su(2 ) doublets ( and sometimes triplets ) in order to obtain realistic fermion mass matrices and mixing angles .",
    "most models have in their construction the strong requirement for the symmetry to determine the tribimaximality in the lepton sector .",
    "the quark sector is then accommodated through the incorporation of more scalars and/or additional abelian symmetries .",
    "an interesting question is to determine if it is possible to create a renormalizable model with a few ( compared to @xmath3 for models in the literature ) su(2 ) doublet scalar fields that would in principle lead to interesting - more tractable - ew scale phenomenology .    in this work",
    "we address this question and find that , under certain conditions , it is possible to create models with a minimum of four su(2 ) doublet scalar fields .",
    "the starting point for our approach relies on the study of the fritzsch - like textures  @xcite in the quark sector in order to determine which groups can be used to reproduce them with the minimum number of su(2 ) doublets ( we only consider non - supersymmetric models ) .",
    "once this is determined , the charged lepton sector can be obtained automatically in analogy with the down - type quarks - note however that this determines the representation of left - handed neutrinos under the flavor symmetry and so it must be checked whether or not that same representation leads to acceptable results for neutrino mass differences and mixing angles ( in general it does not ! ) . as for the neutrino sector",
    ", the models do not include right - handed neutrinos and masses are generated radiatively  @xcite . in order to accomplish this at least two additional su(2 ) singlet scalar fields are needed with non - zero hypercharge , charged under lepton number , and with non - trivial representations under the flavor symmetry .",
    "the smallest group we find that can be used in this scenario is the quaternion group @xmath0 and a model based on it is presented in detail .",
    "the model successfully accommodates all data on both quark and lepton sectors only for an inverted hierarchy in the neutrino sector and without exact tribimaximality ( @xmath0 has been used before as a flavor symmetry in different scenarios , see for example  @xcite ) .    in section  [ model ]",
    "we present the general description of the model based on @xmath0 including the results and discussion of the numerical analysis .",
    "the scalar potential and vacuum alignment for the model is discussed in section  [ potential ] .",
    "the phenomenological study associated to the scalar sector is under investigation and will be presented in another publication .",
    "we then present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "we have included three appendices where we give some details on the group @xmath0 , the analysis of the yukawa mass matrices in the quark sector , and finally the radiative generation of neutrino masses .",
    "consider the sm gauge and fermion content plus four additional su(2 ) scalar doublets ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and two su(2 ) singlet scalar fields ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) with hypercharge @xmath8 and lepton number @xmath9 ( note that no right - handed neutrinos are present ) . now",
    "assume there is an additional flavor symmetry @xmath0 under which the fields above transform in the following way : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the su(2 ) doublets for left - handed quarks and leptons respectively and fields with subscript @xmath13 denote su(2 ) singlet right - handed fermion fields .",
    "note in particular that the ordering of first and second generation fields in the doublet of @xmath0 for the right - handed up - type quarks is reversed compared to the down - type quarks .",
    "this is necessary in order to obtain the same texture in both sectors ( see appendix  [ textures ] for a possible alternative ) .",
    "this is interesting since one naively could expect that the ordering of families should have no effect , i.e. it would amount to a basis rotation .",
    "nevertheless , the non - trivial transformation under the flavor symmetry does produce an effect  @xcite .",
    "another thing to note is the difference in representations between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we alluded to this in the introduction and as it turns out , letting @xmath14 does not accommodate acceptable results in the neutrino sector .",
    "this is an interesting result that shows that the symmetry does play a role in the determination of the mixing angles and mass differences in the neutrino sector as well .",
    "we now present the consequences of these charge assignments for the quarks and lepton mass matrices .",
    "the down - type quark mass matrices are obtained from the following gauge and flavor invariant terms ( see appendix  [ q4details ] ) : @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    where the @xmath0 products are shown explicitly and where the @xmath20 represent numerical unknown coefficients to be determined later .",
    "we have omitted their hermitian conjugates for simplicity .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , which we assume is triggered by the cp - even vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the su(2 ) doublets @xmath4 , the following mass matrix is obtained : @xmath21 where the @xmath22s denote the vevs @xmath23 .    for the up - type quark sector",
    "we obtain @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 .",
    "after ewsb these expressions lead to @xmath30    in order to obtain a fritzsch - like pattern for these matrices the following assumptions are made : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "we were not able to obtain the condition on the unknown coefficients from the flavor symmetry without enlarging the model by using larger groups and more scalars , and thus it is our strongest assumption .",
    "the vacuum alignment condition is analyzed in section  [ potential ] where it is shown that it is consistent with vacuum stability .    under these assumptions",
    "the mass matrices acquire the following textures : @xmath34 where we have parametrized the products of the unknown coefficients @xmath35 with the vevs in terms of the new coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .    following the analysis presented in  @xcite and taking @xmath40 , we rewrite the mass matrices above in terms of the quark masses and free parameters @xmath41  @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and where @xmath48 are matrices with real entries obtained from the phase factorization of @xmath49  @xcite through @xmath50 with @xmath51 diagonal phase matrices such that @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the situation is different .",
