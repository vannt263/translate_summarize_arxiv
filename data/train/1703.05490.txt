    "thermodynamics and statistical physics allow us to describe equilibrium states of systems consisting of many particles by a few variables .",
    "this approach is very effective for many physical and chemical applications , and particularly , when we are dealing with closed systems .",
    "it would be very tempting to find such reduced macroscopic descriptions for large ecological and economic systems .",
    "recently , in the paper @xcite a very reduced description is proposed for a class of ecological models .",
    "it is based on an analog of the mean field theory and aims to describe possible bifurcations . in the present paper",
    ", we suggest a variant of a reduced description for other large class of ecosystems , where many species compete for a few resources . our second goal is to consider one of the most intriguing puzzles in ecosystem theory ,",
    "namely , the biodiversity problem : why can such a large number of similar species share the same habitat and how to estimate this number . aquatic ecosystems is a typical example where many different phytoplankton species do coexist .",
    "the principle of competitive exclusion @xcite asserts that different species sharing the same resource can not coexist and it predicts that an assembly of competing species will converge to a single species . in general , competition models show that the number of species that can coexist in equilibrium can not be greater than the number of limiting factors @xcite .",
    "however , hundreds of species of phytoplankton coexist although only nitrate , phosphate , light and carbon are resources regulating phytoplankton growth @xcite .",
    "the reasons of this fact are poorly understood although the problem rests under a great attention of ecologists ( see , for example , @xcite , among many others ) and they have suggested numerous different approaches to that problem based on game theory , chaos , stochastics , space inhomogeneities , turbulence etc .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model of an ecological system where many species share the very same resource .",
    "our dynamical equations are close to eqs .",
    "considered in @xcite but we extend the model of @xcite to take into account species extinctions and self - limitation effects ( which are important , in particular , for plankton populations , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a number of works devoted to evolution in a multi species context as food - webs , for example , @xcite as well as the effect of species extinctions @xcite .",
    "these papers have used the lotka volterra model where species interactions slowly evolve in time ( that may be connected with foraging @xcite or an adaptation of species behaviour ) and species extinctions are possible when the abundances attain a critical threshold . in our model ,",
    "all parameters are random but , opposite to @xcite , fixed in time and the primary effect on evolution is species extinctions .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "we introduce a specific numerical characteristics , which we will call the stress parameter @xmath0 . that characteristics is a natural dimensionless multiplicative combination of some main parameters involved in the model formulation , namely , the resource turnover rate , the maximum supply of the resource , self - limitation coefficient and averaged specific growth rates .",
    "the stress parameter appears , in a natural way , as a result of a model rescaling and it can be interpreted as a magnitude of selection pressure on ecosystem species induced by the interaction between the ecosystem and its environment .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is large if the resource amount or the resource turnover rate is small . for large values of the stress parameter",
    ", the model exhibits an effect of convergence to similarity as in the competitive lotka - volterra systems studied earlier in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we obtain a complete analytical description of the system behaviour .",
    "we show that the model with or without extinction thresholds are sharply different .",
    "namely , the simpler model without critical extinction threshold exhibits a global stability , when all positive trajectories converge to the same equilibrium independent of initial state . the model with extinctions dynamics is fundamentally non - predictable .",
    "the trajectories tend to different equilibria , and these final states depend on initial data . the biodiversity level , which we observe after a long evolution , can be expressed via the initial number of species , the stress parameter and other ecosystem characteristics in an explicit way .",
    "this convergence to similarity in a species trait can be called a `` concentration effect '' . however",
    ", this concentration effect does not mean that all species are completely identical : other traits defined by species parameters can still differ .",
    "the concentration effect leads to interesting phenomena .",
    "let us suppose that initially an ecosystem contains a number of species with random parameters and consider the limit system , which is a result of a long evolution .",
    "we compare how a sharp change of environment can affect initial and final systems . by our analytical relations",
    "one can estimate the number of species that may go to extinct .",
    "the limit system is more stable than the initial one .",
    "the limit ecosystem , arising as a result of a long evolution , has interesting properties : its dynamics is governed by a simple differential equation of the second order .",
    "this equation describes a nonlinear oscillator with a friction and a memory .",
    "if the friction is small and the memory is negligible the dynamics of this oscillator is defined by a hamiltonian system .",
    "formation of this universal limit system is a result of species extinctions and a selection pressure on some species parameters , namely those important for species survival .",
    "we consider the following system of equations : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 here @xmath4 are species abundances , @xmath5 is the number of species , @xmath6 is resource amount , @xmath7 is the resource turnover rate , @xmath8 is the maximum supply of resource @xmath6 . in total",
    "there are five species specific parameters : @xmath9 are species mortality , @xmath10 is the fraction of resource consumption by individuals of the @xmath11 species , @xmath12 defines species specific self - limitation , the coefficients @xmath13 are species specific growth rates , and @xmath14 are species specific resource constants indicating reduction of resource effect by half . for @xmath15",

    "this variable can be called malthusian parameter .",
    "the second variable @xmath311 does not admit a simple explicit interpretation .",
    "it is a generalization of the quality of life introduced by volterra s .",
    "note that @xmath311 is the integral of @xmath325 , i.e. , it can be considered as an integral malthusian parameter . since",
    "this is a parameter expressing a trait over long time we can call @xmath325 the sustainable malthusian parameter .",
    "( [ hv1da ] ) can be simplified in two cases : for @xmath327 and for bounded times , @xmath328 ( an initial stage ) and for @xmath329 ( large times , the final stage ) . in the first case from we have @xmath330",
    "we obtain an oscillator , which is a perturbed hamiltonian integrable system without memory . in this case for small @xmath7 the solutions of ( [ hv1da ] ) tend to the equilibrium in an oscillating manner ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated a model of ecosystems exploiting a single resource and interacting with the environment .    until may s seminal works @xcite",
    ", ecologists believed that large complex ecosystems , involving a larger number of species and interconnections , are stable .",
    "may @xcite considered a community of @xmath331 species with connectance @xmath332 that measures the number of realized links with respect to the number of all possible links .",
    "r. may s analysis of local stability of an equilibrium gave quite revolutionary results that inspired a great discussion .",
    "it was shown that for large systems with random interaction parameters the instability can occur for large @xmath332 .",
    "more connected communities are more unstable .",
    "this approach is developed in @xcite , where more complicated networks with interactions of different types ( predator - prey , amensalism , mutualism , competition ) were studied .",
    "all these fundamental results hold under the assumption that , at an equilibrium , ecosystems have a random structure , namely , the entries of the matrix , that defines the linearization of system at the equilibrium , are distributed according to smooth densities , for example , gaussian ones .    in this paper",
    ", we use a similar assumption but on the initial choice of species traits .",
    "the initial distribution of species traits is defined by continuous densities with non - empty supports , i.e. , roughly speaking , the species traits are distributed homogeneously in a domain .",
    "we show that in the evolution process the distribution of species traits becomes more concentrated when ecosystem evolves under a stress or as a result of species extinctions . during the evolution process",
    "the domain of species trait localization shrinks .",
    "that small domain of localization means that species become more and more similar ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we do not use any specific assumptions on the adaptation of system parameters . we have found a parameter , which defines the stress level .",
    "this parameter depends on the supply level , turnover rate , and resource consuming intensity .",
    "the most interesting effect of species trait concentration is as follows . for large times",
    "a stable and simple limit ecosystem appears just because of most species goes extinct under stress . for large times ecosystem dynamics and extinctions of species under stress produces a self - organized community consisting of species with close consumer efficiencies ( note that these species can be different in other traits ) . in some cases , dynamics of this limit community",
    "can be described by a simple equation , which describes a nonlinear oscillator with a friction and a memory , which is close to a hamiltonian system .",
    "we have found an asymptotic approach to study this system .",
    "note that the reduction mechanism differs from previously found one in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a mean field approach is applied to complex ecosystems and gene networks .",
    "this approach exploits the system topology , when species ( genes ) can interact with many others .",
    "complicated systems of equations were reduced to a single differential equation of the first order .",
    "such equations do not exhibit time oscillations whereas our equation simulates a perturbed nonlinear oscillator and it can describe slowly decreasing oscillations . in @xcite",
    "a reduction to hamiltonian systems is also based on topological properties of interactions in ecosystems .",
    "so , the reduced descriptions of complex systems proposed in @xcite can be called a topological one .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , in the present paper the reduced description is based not only on the system topology ( i.e. , the fact that species share the same resource ) but also on others phenomena : extinctions and selection by a tough environment ( which can be measured by the stress parameter ) .    these results can be useful for understanding why ecosystems where species feeds on few resources can have a large biodiversity , and how mass extinctions depend on environment and ecosystem parameters .",
    "the intriguing effect is that we observe a picture similar to statistical physics : the state of a ecosystem which arises as a product of a long evolution can be described by two quantities @xmath333 having a biological interpretation .",
    "namely , @xmath325 can be called malthusian parameter , and this quantity determines a balance between mean mortal and growth rates . the second quantity @xmath311 can be named sustainable malthusian parameter , and it can be obtained by integrating @xmath325 over time .",
    "we have computed analytically the number of finally coexisting survived species and how to this number depends on main ecosystem parameters ( the resource supply , the mortality rates , the resource turnover etc ) .",
    "it is shown that the main quantity that determines final biodiversity is the stress parameter .",
    "the authors are thankful to referee for useful remarks .",
    "the second author was supported by linkoping university and by the government of the russian federation through mega - grant 074-u01 , and rfbr grant 16 - 01 - 00648 .",
    "assume that all @xmath334 .",
    "then the eigenvalue problem for the linear part of the right - hand side of ( [ hx1 ] ) , ( [ hv1 ] ) at the equilibrium point @xmath76 has the form @xmath335 @xmath336 where @xmath337 is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath338 . solving the first system with respect to @xmath288 and inserting the solution into the second equation we obtain @xmath339 and @xmath340 since @xmath341 at the equilibrium point we arrived at ( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "we apply a special method based on the theory of decreasing operators in banach spaces ( see @xcite and references therein ) that allows us to prove this assertion without any additional assumptions .",
    "this approach is applicable here due to special properties of monotonicity of our problem .",
    "our next step is to rewrite system , as an integral equation for unknown function @xmath346 .",
    "let @xmath347 be a given non - negative , continuous , bounded function on @xmath348 having a limit @xmath349 at infinity .",
    "we can resolve eqs .",
    "( with @xmath6 replaced by @xmath50 ) following section [ lim ] . as a result , we obtain @xmath350 where @xmath351 and @xmath352      next , we can solve eq .",
    "with respect to @xmath6 , where @xmath4 is given by ( [ appx ] ) and @xmath355 .",
    "we denote this solution by @xmath356 .",
    "we can not write this solution explicitly but we need in what follows only some of its properties .",
    "first , this solution is a decreasing function with respect to @xmath4 and consequently with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "second , @xmath357 where @xmath358 .",
    "thus the unique solution to the problem , with the cauchy data ( [ idata ] ) can be obtained by solving the following fixed point problem @xmath359 and then @xmath360 to solve the equation @xmath361 in the class of bounded , continuous , non - negative functions ( denoted by @xmath362 ) , we use the following iterations @xmath363 then @xmath364 ( here @xmath365 denotes the partial order on @xmath362 : @xmath366 if @xmath367 $ ] ) .    to show the convergence of the odd and even iterations , we observe that we can consider the fixed point equation ( [ appw ] ) on a finite interval @xmath368 .",
