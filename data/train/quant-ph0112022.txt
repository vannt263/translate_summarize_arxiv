    "the different systems are totally factorized , so the state vector of the composite system reads @xmath133 ( we note that superscripts do not denote the power , but they serve as indices . )",

    "as before we have @xmath140 which yields @xmath141 the right - hand side of the congruence is equal to @xmath142 which affects only the global phase .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath143 consequently a set of @xmath144 unmeasured particles becomes entangled due to the bell - type measurement performed on the @xmath145 particles .",

    "let us subject the last @xmath3 particles from @xmath129-th ( @xmath150 ) system to the bell - type measurement in the basis formed by vectors . given the result of the measurement the @xmath144 unmeasured particles collapse into the maximally entangled state @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    "in this paper we have presented a general formalism describing entanglement swapping between multi - qudit systems .",
    "we have shown that by performing bell - type measurements one can create entangled states ( with an arbitrary number of particles ) from particles which have never interacted before .",
    "even though our formalism has been developed for finite - dimensional hilbert space , it can be generalized for continuous variables , i.e. @xmath154 . in this case",
    "qudits are replaced by harmonic oscillators ( e.g. quantized modes of an electromagnetic field ) .",
    "formally , in the limit @xmath154 we can substitute a two - qudit maximally entangled state by a two - mode correlated state , i.e. @xmath155 where @xmath156 once these states are defined one can formally perform the same manipulations as in the case of qudits , i.e. generalized bell measurements , etc .",
    "nevertheless , we remind ourselves that the maximally correlated states as well as require infinite energy for their creation . for this reason",
    "it is desirable to consider two - mode ( and multi - mode ) squeezed states which in the limit of infinite squeezing are equal to and , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to describe these two mode state in term of their wigner functions . in particular ,",

    "if we trace over one of the modes , i.e. , if we perform an integration over the parameters @xmath159 and @xmath160 we obtain from ( [ 2.33 ] ) a wigner function of a thermal field where @xmath161 is the mean excitation number in the two - mode squeezed vacuum under consideration .",
    "we note that the thermal state is a maximally mixed state ( i.e. the state with the highest value of the von neumann entropy ) for a given mean excitation number .",
    "this means that the pure state ( [ 2.33 ] ) is the most entangled state for a given mean excitation number . from this",
    "it follows that to create a truly maximally entangled state , i.e. the state ( [ 2.33 ] ) in the limit @xmath162 , an infinite number of quanta is needed and so infinite energy .    from one",
    "can easily find the wigner functions of other states @xmath163 .",
    "we remind ourselves that wigner functions are invariant under canonical transformations .",
    "taking into account that states @xmath163 can be obtained from @xmath157 by a canonical transformation ( see ) @xmath164 its wigner function can be obtained via a simple substitution of variables from the wigner function .",
    "the generalized bell measurement in this representation corresponds to a povm measurement of the artur - kelly type @xcite .",
