    "the isobaric analogue resonances ( iar ) have been discovered about four decades ago .",
    "they are the consequences of the approximate isospin symmetry . in the absence of isospin symmetry braking forces",
    "the analogue state would be degenerate with corresponding state of the parent nucleus .",
    "the coulomb forces and isospin dependent interactions shift up the position of the analogue state and the analogue state may acquire a small width and may become a resonance .",
    "the iar has attracted interest in the latest development of the study of the light exotic nuclei .",
    "the unusual properties of neutron reach nuclei can provide insights into the nuclear structure far from the valley of stability .",
    "the extreme neutron to proton ratios may help to understand the nuclear matter at extreme conditions .",
    "however the experimental study of the neutron rich nuclei around the neutron drip line are difficult .",
    "since the iar has essentially the same structure as the parent state it was suggested that instead of the neutron reach exotic nuclei ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) @xcite their less exotic analogue states should be studied ( with inverse kinematics ) to gain information about the properties of these exotic nuclei .",
    "recent developments in experimental facilities opened the possibility for identifying large number of exotic nuclei . to understand the structure of these nuclei new theoretical methods",
    "have been introduced for describing the dynamics of weakly bound or unbound nuclei from which nucleons can be emitted .",
    "some of the new methods is e.g. the shell model in the complex energy plane ( cxsm ) @xcite or the gamow shell model @xcite use the berggren basis @xcite . in the berggren basis bound and resonant states are treated on equal footed and scattering states taken along a contour @xmath4 of the complex energy sheet are included as it will be discussed later in detail . in the last few years this basis has been used successfully in a serious of works @xcite . since the extended use of this basis started not very long ago",
    "therefore we think that it is worthwhile to accumulate more experience concerning its accuracy and its dependence on their parameters .",
    "another well established method for calculating resonances is the complex scaling ( cs ) method .",
    "cs has a strict mathematical foundation given in refs.@xcite .",
    "the possible applications and the details of the cs method are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the iar states phenomenologically can be described by the lane equations @xcite or they can be studied by microscopically @xcite .",
    "coupled channel ( cc ) lane equations offer a simple but not trivial ( the simplest multichannel ) example on which both the cxsm and the cs approaches can be checked .",
    "our aim in this work is to compare the parameters of the iar calculated by different methods .",
    "we shall compare the characteristic features of the two methods working on the complex energy plane .",
    "the conclusion of such a methodical work can be useful later in analyzing experimental data in more realistic calculations .",
    "the cs can be applied only for dilatation analytic potentials and interactions .",
    "however some of the widely used potentials in nuclear physics are not dilatation analytic or dilatation analytic only in a limited range of the rotation angle , i.e. below the critical value of the angle .",
    "therefore we repeated our calculation with a slightly modified coulomb potential which is dilatation analytic .",
    "this comparison is very useful to compare the accuracy of the cxsm and cs methods if they give the same results in cases when both methods can be applied .    in section [ sec : lane ]",
    "we summarize the features of the lane equations . in section [ sec : cxres ] we describe the approximate solution of the lane equations using the cxsm , while in section [ sec : cslane ] we make a short description of the solution of the lane equations using cs . in chapter [ numeres ]",
    "we give the numerical results of the calculations .",
    "in the first part of chapter [ numeres ] we compare the positions of the poles of the s - matrix calculated by the cxsm method with that extracted from the solution of the lane equations .",
    "the results of the cs method are also presented here .",
    "the similarities and differences of the cxsm and cs methods are also discussed in that chapter .",
    "finally in the last chapter we summarize the main conclusions of the paper .",

    "if we neglect the mass difference between the neutron and proton and denote the additional coulomb energy of the analogue nucleus by @xmath19 then the eigenvalue of the internal motion of the analogue state is simply @xmath20 and we have @xmath21 .",

    "this agreement suggests that the two method are basically equivalent in those cases when both methods can be applied .",
    "besides the similarities and differences of the cxsm and the cs methods discussed so far there are further important differences between them .",
    "the application of the uniform cs method used here is restricted to dilatation analytic potentials and the range of the rotational angle could also be limited . on the other hand in the cxsm method the shape of the contour can be chosen with large flexibility although to go too deep into the complex energy might spoil a bit the accuracy of the calculated results .",
    "another advantage of the cxsm is that the structure of the resonant state can be seen directly from the coefficients of the perturbed wave function . in the cs method",
    "the same information can be explored in a more indirect way .",
