    "<S> devices based on magnetic semiconductors represent a novel generation of information technology where mram functionalities arise simply from bulk properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the magnetic state of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) can be quickly and conveniently characterized by transport measurements by taking advantage of the unusually large anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) . </S>",
    "<S> while ahe is one of the prominent key properties of ferromagnetic semiconductors , it represents a situation of general interest but little firm knowledge .    in general , ahe may arise from scattering processes involving spin - orbit coupling . in the skew scattering and side - jump models </S>",

    "<S> we test this possibility experimentally by modifying the scattering process via application of hydrostatic pressure .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative class of descriptions relates ahe to the berry phase acquired while the electrons propagate in spin - orbit coupled bloch bands . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the ahe arises from near degeneracy points of the bands @xcite where interband processes become relevant . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit coupling and the lack of inversion symmetry may result in this type of ahe even for collinear ferromagnets @xcite . our high magnetic field experiments aim to reveal an ahe contribution arising from the relative displacement of the various spin - up and spin - down bands .    </S>",
    "<S> insb has the largest spin - orbit coupling among the iii - v semiconductors , and becomes a ferromagnetic metal a when few percent of mn@xmath0 ions are inserted into the in@xmath1 sites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is well known @xcite , including the parameters of the partially filled heavy hole ( hh ) and light hole ( lh ) bands . </S>",
    "<S> ( in , mn)sb is an ideal system to study ahe , and our purpose is to distinguish between the possible ahe mechanisms experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> the in@xmath2mn@xmath3sb sample was grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) in a riber 32 r@xmath4d mbe system on closely lattice matched hybrid ( 001 ) cdte / gaas substrates to a thickness of @xmath5 nm ( for further growth details and structural characterization , see refs . and ) . </S>",

    "<S> the samples were mounted in a self - clamping cell , with kerosene as the pressure medium .    </S>",
    "<S> in ferromagnetic systems the hall - resistivity is often described as a sum of two terms , @xmath6 a normal hall contribution due to the lorentz force , plus an anomalous hall term ( @xmath7 ) that is proportional to the magnetization @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a similar separation can be made in the hall - conductivity , @xmath9    mn@xmath3sb at various temperatures , up to magnetic field @xmath10t.,width=240 ]    here the first term corresponds to the normal hall effect related to the carrier concentration ( @xmath11 ) , while the second term defines the anomalous hall conductivity , @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the ahe in terms of @xmath7 or @xmath12 is not a simple technical question . </S>",
    "<S> the description by @xmath7 implicitly assumes that the hall signal arising from different processes is additive in the scattering rate , 1/@xmath13 . on the contrary , in the berry phase picture the transverse current due to </S>",
    "<S> the ahe is additive , and does not depend on the electron scattering that determines the longitudinal current .    in most materials - including ( in , </S>",
    "<S> mn)sb - the hall - resistivity ( @xmath14 ) is at least by one order of magnitude smaller than longitudinal resistivity ( @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the hall conductivity defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 can not be distinguished from the off - diagonal conductivity derived by matrix inversion from eq .  1 , as @xmath16 .    in magnetic semiconductors at low magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz term gives usually a negligible contribution compared to the ahe , and the hall resistivity seems to be simply proportional to the magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is exemplified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 by the temperature dependence of the hall - signal in ( in , mn)sb : the development of a large nonlinear contribution to @xmath17 and the onset of hysteresis loops signify the crossing of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary @xcite .    the hall phenomenon at high magnetic fields , however , is more complex : the anomalous hall effect is not simply proportional to the magnetization , i.e. the ahe coefficient - either @xmath18 or @xmath19 - is not a constant , but strongly field dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the upper panel in fig .  2 displays the hall - resistivity up to @xmath20 t , at various pressures . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the two terms of eq . ( 1 ) play different roles in the different field ranges . at low fields , </S>",
    "<S> the negative contribution of the ahe overcomes the positive normal hall term , while at high fields the linear contribution due to the lorentz force is dominating . </S>",
    "<S> subtracting the linear term from the total hall signal the resulting the anomalous hall term has a non - monotonic dependence on the magnetic field : following a sharp peak it slowly decays , changes sign ( see inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , then saturates at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> as the magnetization gradually increases with increasing magnetic field , it is clear that the @xmath21 relation is not valid .    </S>",
    "<S> mn@xmath3sb at various pressures , up to magnetic field @xmath20 t . </S>",
    "<S> the gray line crossing the origin corresponds to the normal hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> lower panel : illustration of the possible field dependence of the normal hall resistivity due to multiband effects ; the two gray curves represent the very extreme limits for the field dependence in the normal hall resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the high - field behavior , where @xmath7 saturates at a constant , positive value.,width=278 ]    before proceeding , we note that the separation of the normal hall effect by subtracting a linear term - which is often applied as a first step of the analysis - assumes that the linear field dependence of the normal hall resistivity is not affected by the multiband nature of the electrical conductivity . in materials where various bands contribute to the conductivity , however , a deviation from the linear variation is expected , since the contribution of the different types of carriers is not simply additive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this is true , the characteristic field above which this effect may influence the normal hall term is quite high , given by @xmath22 which is @xmath23 t for ( in , mn)sb . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that the subband hall contributions to the normal hall effect themselves are field dependent due to the change in the population of the spin - split bands . as both the band parameters @xcite and the value of the exchange coupling is known @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is easy to show that in the magnetic field range of the experiments this leads to less than @xmath24 correction to @xmath25 .    the normal hall effect may however be field dependent for a third reason . in case of different types of carriers </S>",
    "<S> any difference in the magnetic field dependence of the subband resistivities influences the relative weights of the subband hall contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the contributions of the two subbands to the normal hall effect can not be determined separately , the limiting bounds of the field dependence can easily be evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to the situations when one of the two subbands makes the dominant contribution to the hall effect , while the magnetoresistance arises solely either from this or from the other subband . </S>",
    "<S> these limiting curves can be derived from the experimentally determined magnetoresistance . as a result , the area enclosed by the gray curves in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 represents the possible field dependence of the normal hall resistivity arising from the multiband nature of ( in , mn)sb . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the observed hall signal is far beyond even the extreme limits of the normal hall term . </S>",
    "<S> thus the strong field dependence has to be attributed to the anomalous hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> note also that , due to the identical ( positive ) sign of @xmath25 in the heavy- and light - hole bands , a negative peak can not arise from multiband effects under any circumstances .        </S>",
    "<S> next we briefly discuss the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure effects on the magnetotransport have been investigated in detail previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we only recall that while the number of charge carriers is not influenced by pressure ( as demonstrated by the high field behavior of the hall resistivity shown on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , the longitudinal resistivity is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observations shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 and 4(b ) suggest that @xmath26 has the form of @xmath27 , indicating that resistivity change is due to the pressure induced enhancement of the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal resistivity increases by more than @xmath28 for the applied pressure of @xmath29gpa . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the anomalous part of the off - diagonal conductivity is independent of pressure ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c and 5a ) , indicating a dissipationless anomalous hall current @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the above observation is in disagreement with the extrinsic scattering picture . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the strong field dependence of the ahe is also suggestive of an intrinsic mechanism , which is independent of the scattering processes and is rather determined by the singularities in the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the anomalous hall conductivity changes sign as a function of magnetic field ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5a ) , which is not expected in the scattering models of the ahe .    </S>",
    "<S> berry phase calculations of the ahe are based on the four band spherical luttinger model of the ( iii , v ) semiconductors which takes into account parabolic dispersions for heavy - hole and light - hole bands in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite . furthermore , in the ferromagnetic case an additional term , @xmath30 has to be introduced into the total hamiltonian @xcite , which represents the exchange interaction between the localized magnetic moments on mn@xmath0 ions ( @xmath31 ) and the spins of the charge - carrying holes ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling results in the spin splitting of the valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> jungwirth et al . </S>",
    "<S> have shown that if both spin - orbit and exchange coupling ( @xmath33 ) are important , then ahe is generally nonlinear in the magnetization , and it may have both positive and negative signs . their numerical calculations - including the influence of the split - off band and also the nonparabolic nature of the valence bands - gave good estimates for the magnitude of the ahe in ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as .     as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath8 is clearly seen to be linear over a wide field range above about @xmath35 t . </S>",
    "<S> the dash - dotted line corresponds to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4).,width=326 ]    the luttiger parameters of insb @xcite indicate that for in@xmath2mn@xmath3sb , where the hole concentration is @xmath36@xmath37 , the fermi level is only @xmath38mev away from the lower lying split - off band . due to the exchange splitting , </S>",
    "<S> the majority and minority spin bands move about @xmath39mev apart from each other . in the berry - phase picture , the dominant contributions to ahe arise from the nearly degenerate points of the bands located close to the fermi energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vicinity of the split - off band - even without band - crossing - may then have a significant effect on the berry phase acquired by the heavy and light holes , and the large shift of up- and down - spin bands may be responsible to the measured field dependence of the ahe .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that as the magnetic field is varied , the relative position of the bands shifts linearly with the absolute value of the magnetization ( due to the exchange origin of the splitting ) . assuming that the corresponding correction in the anomalous hall coefficient is also linear in band shift , i.e. @xmath40 , one obtains the anomalous hall conductivity varying as @xmath41 such a behavior is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 , where the experimentally determined @xmath42 and the corresponding @xmath43 curves are plotted in the from of @xmath44 versus @xmath8 . the observed linear variation above @xmath45 t confirms the above phenomenological picture ( using only one fitting parameter , @xmath46@xmath47emu ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we showed that - in contrast to the general belief - in ( in , mn)sb the ahe not simply proportional to magnetization . the anomalous hall signal ( either @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) </S>",
    "<S> can even reverse sign before saturating at high field . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this behavior of ahe to berry phase effects , and we propose a qualitative description of the field - dependent ahe , where exchange splitting leads to a relative shift between the valence bands and the nearby split - off band . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic nature of the ahe was also confirmed by high pressure experiments : we demonstrated that the off - diagonal terms of the conductivity tensor are not influenced , while the diagonal terms are reduced due to the pressure - induced enhancement of the scattering process . </S>"
