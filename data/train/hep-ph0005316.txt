    "at the next generation of colliders center - of - mass energies will be reached that largely exceed the electroweak scale .",
    "for instance , the energy at a future linear @xmath6 collider is expected to be in the tev range  @xcite . at these energies",
    "one enters the realm of large perturbative corrections .",
    "even the effects arising from weak corrections are expected to be of the order of @xmath7 or more  @xcite , i.e.  just as large as the well - known electromagnetic corrections . in order not to jeopardize any of the high - precision studies at these high - energy colliders ,",
    "it is therefore indispensable to improve the theoretical understanding of the radiative corrections in the weak sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in particular this will involve a careful analysis of effects beyond first order in the perturbative expansion in the ( electromagnetic ) coupling @xmath8 .",
    "+ the dominant source of radiative corrections at tev - scale energies is given by logarithmically enhanced effects of the form @xmath9 for @xmath10 , involving particle masses @xmath2 well below the collider energy @xmath11 .",
    "a natural way of controlling the theoretical uncertainties would therefore consist in a comprehensive study of these large logarithms , taking into account all possible sources ( i.e.ultraviolet , soft , and collinear ) . in first approximation the so - called sudakov logarithms @xmath12 , arising from collinear - soft singularities  @xcite , constitute the leading contribution to the large electroweak correction factors .",
    "recent studies have focused on these sudakov effects in the process @xmath13 @xcite@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the three independent studies are in mutual disagreement , exhibiting strikingly different higher - order results already for the virtual corrections .",
    "the main cause for the differences can be traced back to the use of different assumptions concerning the exponentiation properties of the sudakov logarithms in the sm .",
    "many of these assumptions are based on the analogy with unbroken theories like qed and qcd , where the resummation of the higher - order effects amounts to an exponentiation of the one - loop corrections ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite@xcite ) . however , the sm is a broken gauge theory with a large mass gap in the neutral sector between the massless photon and the massive @xmath4 boson , making it a theory with more than one mass scale . as",
    "such it remains to be seen how much of the analogy with unbroken theories actually pertains to the sm .",
    "+ in this letter we therefore focus on the virtual sudakov logarithms in the reaction @xmath5 , in an attempt to clarify how the @xmath14 effects relate to the @xmath15 ones . in this way we identify to what extent",
    "the sm behaves like an unbroken theory at high energies .",
    "moreover , since the sudakov logarithms originate from the exchange of soft , effectively on - shell gauge bosons , many of the features derived for the virtual corrections are intimately related to properties of the corresponding real - gauge - boson emission processes .",
    "in order to facilitate the calculation of the one- and two - loop sudakov logarithms , we work in the coulomb gauge for both massless and massive gauge bosons ( the subtleties associated with the coulomb gauge for massive gauge bosons will be discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . working in this special gauge has the advantage that all virtual sudakov logarithms are contained exclusively in the self - energies of the external on - shell particles  @xcite or the self - energies of any intermediate particle that happens to be effectively on - shell .",
    "the latter is , for instance , needed for the production of near - resonance unstable particles .",
    "the elegance of this method lies in its universal nature , with the sudakov logarithms originating from vertex , box etc .",
    "corrections being suppressed .",
    "once all self - energies to all on - shell / on - resonance sm particles have been calculated , the prediction of the sudakov form factor for an _ arbitrary _ electroweak process becomes trivial .",
    "the relevant self - energies for the calculation of the sudakov logarithms involve the exchange of collinear - soft gauge bosons , including their potential mixing with the corresponding would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "the collinear - soft exchange of fermions and ghosts leads to suppressed contributions , since the propagators of these particles do not have the required pole structure .      as mentioned above , in order to determine the sudakov logarithms in the process @xmath5 one has to calculate the external self - energies ( i.e.  the wave - function factors ) of all fermions involved in the process .",
    "+ consider to this end the fermionic one - loop self - energy @xmath16 , originating from the emission of a gauge boson @xmath17 with loop - momentum @xmath18 and mass @xmath19 from a fermion @xmath20 with momentum @xmath21 : +    self    ( 140,140 )    -i ^(1)(p , n , m_1 ) =     + here @xmath22 is the unit vector in the time direction , which enters by virtue of using the coulomb gauge . in the high - energy limit",
    "the fermion mass in the numerator of the fermion propagator can be neglected and similarly the contribution involving a mixed gauge - boson  goldstone - boson propagator can be discarded .",
    "the self - energy @xmath23 then contains an odd number of @xmath24-matrices , leading to the following natural decomposition in terms of the two possible structures @xmath25 and @xmath26 : ^(1)(p , n , m_1 ) & & e^2_ff_1v_1^^2  .",
    "the coupling factor @xmath27 is defined according to _ ff_1v_1 & = & v_ff_1v_1 - _",

    "finally the square root should be taken of the external wave - function factor , i.e.  the one - loop contribution should be multiplied by the usual factor @xmath34 . for an initial - state fermion ,",

    "@xcite that only rainbow diagrams contribute in physical gauges like the axial or the coulomb gauge .",

    "@xcite the extra term was interpreted as a source of non - exponentiation , we observe that it in fact cancels against a specific term originating from the triple gauge - boson diagrams of set ( d ) .",

    "hence , the cancellations that take place automatically in unbroken gauge theories also hold in the sm , in spite of it being a theory with more than one scale in the sense that the on - shell poles for photons and @xmath4 bosons do not coincide and therefore lead to different on - shell residues ( see sect .
