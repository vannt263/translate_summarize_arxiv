    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is currently operating between the 2/3 and 7/10 resonances with a beam  beam parameter of approximately 0.015 leaving little space for significant increase in luminosity . the rhic luminosity upgrade program @xcite aims at an increase of the luminosity by a factor of 2 .",
    "in order to accommodate the significant increase in beam  beam tune spread it was decided to install electron lenses to compensate for the beam  beam non - linearities and effectively reduce the tune spread at constant bunch intensity .",
    "this technology was first developed at the tevatron where it was tested for head - on compensation @xcite and then successfully used for long - range compensation , abort gap cleaning @xcite and collimation studies @xcite .",
    "the rhic collider consists of two rings where the beams are colliding in interaction points ip6 and ip8 as shown in fig .",
    "the two electron lenses , one for each ring , will be located close to ip10 .",
    "studies regarding dynamic aperture were performed and showed improvements for high beam  beam parameter @xcite .",
    "the details about the status and construction of the electron lens can be found in ref .",
    "these simulations however did not cover the coherent beam  beam effects related to the electron lens .",
    "the failure in increasing the luminosity in the dci ( dispositif de collisions dans ligloo ) four - beam experiment ( @xmath0 ) was attributed to coherent effects @xcite , which should therefore be carefully investigated .",
    "this paper reports on strong  strong beam  beam simulations performed using the rhic lattice and upgrade parameters and related beam experiments to understand the impact of the coherent beam  beam effects in the presence of electron lenses .",
    "the simulation code beambeam3d @xcite was used for this study .",
    "beambeam3d is a fully parallelized three - dimensional code allowing for self - consistent field calculation of arbitrary distributions and tracking of multiple bunches .",
    "the transport from one ip to the other is done through linear transfer maps .",
    "the beam fields are calculated by solving the poisson equation using a shifted integrated green function method which is efficiently computed with a fft - based algorithm on a uniform grid .    in order to correctly model the rhic lattice the twiss parameters are extracted at each ip , including the one where the head - on compensation takes place , and used to compute the transfer maps . as shown in fig . [ rhic ] , the symmetry of the different colliding ips allows one to reduce the number of bunches to three per beam to simulate the full collision pattern .",
    "the electron lens is modelled as a thin - lens gaussian beam located exactly at ip10 for both beams .",
    "the size of the electron beam is determined by the lattice parameters . the phase advance between ip8 and ip10",
    "is set exactly to @xmath1 by artificially shifting the phase between these two ips and evenly compensating the global tune change with the other arcs .",
    "protons per bunch with and without compensation .",
    "no compensation in red , half compensation in blue.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fp ] shows the footprints calculated with beambeam3d for an intensity of @xmath2 protons per bunch without compensation and with half compensation .",
    "the footprint with compensation was artificially shifted for better visibility .",
    "as expected , we observe a reduction of the tune spread by a factor of 2 .",
    "one can also see that the footprint without compensation is crossing the @xmath3 resonance , indicating that the machine can not be operated with such high beam  beam parameter .",
    "in addition to the single - particle effects described in the previous sections , colliding beams will experience coherent dipole oscillation driven by the beam  beam force . in the simplest case of one interaction point two main modes",
    "arise corresponding to the two bunches oscillating in phase ( @xmath4-mode ) or out of phase ( @xmath1-mode ) .",
    "the @xmath4-mode will oscillate at the betatron frequency and the @xmath1-mode will be shifted , negatively for equally charged beams , with respect to the @xmath4-mode by an amount @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the yokoya factor and @xmath7 the beam  beam parameter @xcite .    the collision pattern at rhic can be reduced to three colliding bunches theoretically giving rise to six coherent dipole modes . in reality , only two modes are observed as the other ones are located inside or very close to the incoherent tune spread and are landau damped .",
    "figure [ modes ] shows a strong  strong simulation of the rhic lattice with and without compensation .",
    "the bare lattice tunes used for this simulation are ( 0.695 , 0.685 ) as defined in the design and the beam  beam parameter @xmath7 per ip is 0.011 . only the vertical plane is shown but a similar picture is observed in the horizontal plane .",
    "the coherent modes are excited with an initial kick of 0.1  @xmath4 .    as predicted by the weak ",
    "strong simulations in fig .",
    "[ fp ] , the incoherent continuum is reduced by the head - on compensation . the bare lattice tunes , or @xmath4-mode in this plot , are shifted by @xmath8 corresponding to the coherent beam  beam tune shift induced by the quadrupolar part of the beam  beam force .",
    "this effect can be easily predicted and corrected for .",
    "the phase advance between ips is also modified leading to slightly different relative frequencies of the modes .    in the presence of head - on compensation ,",
    "the distance in tune space covered by the coherent modes therefore remains approximately constant while the incoherent tune spread is significantly reduced .",
    "all six coherent modes are now observed as they are moved out of the continuum and not landau damped any more .",
    "head - on compensation with electron lenses reduces the intrinsic stabilizing properties of the beam ",
    "beam interaction .",
    "this could give rise to coherent dipole instabilities driven by external sources of excitation or impedance .",
    "as seen in fig . [ modes ] , even if the incoherent tune spread is reduced , the tune space covered by the coherent modes remains constant and will overlap the 2/3 resonance in the case of the rhic working point .",
    "while it is difficult to experimentally reproduce the reduction of the tune spread induced by the electron lenses , we verified experimentally that driving the @xmath1-mode onto this resonance would not excite coherent dipole motion or degrade the beam lifetime .",
    "for this experiment we moved only the two tunes of the blue beam towards the 2/3 resonance keeping the difference @xmath9 , see figs .",
    "[ qscan ] and [ btf_qscan ] .",
    "this was done with a beam  beam parameter estimated to be 0.011 .",
    "the onset of losses is observed at ( 0.687 , 0.683 ) ; at these tunes the location of the @xmath1-mode is 0.669 and the zero - amplitude particles are at 0.672 : no emittance blow - up is observed at that point .",
    "losses are observed only in the blue beam , indicating that the @xmath1-mode , which has the same frequency for both beams , is insensitive to the 2/3 resonance .",
    "the stop band of the 2/3 resonance with non - colliding beams was estimated to be around 0.005 , which is consistent with losses of low - amplitude particles in our case . as we moved the beam closer to the resonance strong losses associated with emittance blow - up",
    "were observed only in the blue beam .",
    "in addition , no unusual activity was observed in the tune spectrum during the whole experiment , pointing towards a reduction of the dynamic aperture rather than the excitation of coherent modes .",
    "the tune scan was reproduced in numerical simulations .",
    "figure [ fft_qscan ] shows the fft of the centre of motion during the the tune scan .",
    "it is observed that even when the @xmath1-mode is on top of the 2/3 resonance it remains stable .",
    "figure [ emit_qscan ] shows the vertical emittance growth for both beams . only the blue beam , pushed towards the resonance ,",
    "is affected and a blow - up is observed only when the beam  beam tune spread overlaps the resonance .",
    "this is very consistent with experimental data and confirms that the 2/3 resonance is not a concern for beam stability .",
    "the only non - linear element in the model is the beam  beam interaction .",
    "the absence of sextupoles explains why the stop band of the resonance is narrower in the numerical simulation .",
    "coherent beam  beam mode suppression has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the following techniques can be used to damp the modes :    * phase advance adjustment between colliding ips * synchro  betatron coupling .",
    "if @xmath10 , the @xmath1-mode can be damped by the sidebands of the continuum * beams colliding on different working points ( tune split )    although these effects could all be reproduced in simulations , one has to consider the constraints associated with the machine layout and beam parameters . due to the magnet powering scheme in the rhic",
    "there is very little flexibility to adjust the phase advance between the colliding ips ( ip6 and ip8 ) .",
    "the synchrotron tune @xmath11 is of the order of @xmath12 , which is much smaller than the expected beam  beam parameter in the presence of head - on compensation ( @xmath130.03 ) making it impossible to profit from synchro  betatron coupling .",
    "this leaves the tune split as the only option for coherent mode suppression in the rhic .    to fully suppress the coherent modes the tune split between the two beams has to be larger than the beam  beam parameter , in which case the coherent modes will cluster inside the incoherent continuum and experience landau damping @xcite",
    "this can be achieved at the rhic with tunes of about ( 0.695 , 0.685 ) for the blue beam and ( 0.74 , 0.73 ) for the yellow beam .",
    "figure [ split_btf ] shows an example of a btf measurement with the beams on different tunes .",
    "the coherent modes are completely suppressed , as expected from the theory .",
    "figure [ split_emit ] shows emittance measurements over four consecutive stores with split tunes .",
    "a strong emittance blow - up is observed in three fills out of four as soon as the beams are brought into collision , leading to poor luminosity performance . for comparison ,",
    "the emittance at the beginning of the stores is generally around 15mmmrad for normal operation .",
    "this behaviour for colliding beams with unequal tunes had been predicted in past simulations and theoretical analysis @xcite , where it was stated that operating a collider with unequal tunes could lead to coherent beam ",
    "beam resonance excitation and , providing the modes lie inside the incoherent continuum , emittance blow - up .            using the estimated working points ( 0.689 , 0.691 ) and ( 0.74 , 0.73 ) and beam  beam parameter ( 0.013 ) one can compute the frequencies of the coherent modes using a rigid bunch model . in this specific case",
    "the machine was operated in the vicinity of a resonance of the form @xmath14 , which is excited by offset collisions .",
    "numerical simulations were carried out to assess the impact of this resonance on emittance .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ split_emit_sim ] , where three cases were considered :    * head - on collisions with tunes close to the resonance ( experimental conditions ) * collisions with an offset of 1@xmath4 in the horizontal plane with tunes close to the resonance * collisions with an offset of 1@xmath4 in the horizontal plane with tunes away from the resonance    a strong emittance blow - up is observed in the case of offset collisions with working points close to the resonance condition .",
    "when the beams are colliding head - on or the working points are moved away from the resonance the conditions simulated for equal tunes are almost recovered .",
    "simulations appear to confirm the hypothesis of a coherent beam  beam resonance of odd order .",
    "we could expect that by properly setting the working points to avoid resonances nominal luminosity performance could be achieved .",
    "another important parameter in the rhic is the polarization . during the split tune experiment",
    "a very poor polarization was measured for the yellow beam ( 0.74 , 0.73 ) , ruling out the possibility of running the rhic in this configuration .",
    "figure [ emit_wn ] shows the emittance growth due to white - noise excitation . in this case ,",
    "beam parameters were set to be away from any low - order resonance .",
    "it is clearly observed that colliding the beams with unequal tunes degrades the situation and makes the beams more sensitive to external excitation .",
    "this was not verified experimentally and would need confirmation but could become an issue if operation with split tunes is considered for a collider .",
    "head - on compensation with electron lenses will significantly reduce the beam  beam tune spread and landau damping . the interplay with machine impedance",
    "was studied in numerical simulations using the rhic impedance model which takes into account the contribution of stripline bpms ( beam position monitor ) , bellows and resistive wall .",

    "the bottom plot is a scan in octupolar detuning with impedance only .",
    "stability is achieved for a detuning coefficient @xmath15m@xmath16 .",
    "table [ tab : dq ] summarizes the stabilizing coefficient obtained from tracking simulations and the detuning coefficients derived from the rhic non - linear model .",
    "considering the uncertainties from the impedance model and the difficulty in accurately computing the stability threshold from tracking simulation , it is not unlikely that the machine non - linearities provide sufficient detuning to stabilize the beam .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that instabilities are generally not observed during rhic polarized proton runs .",
    "even when half - compensated the beam  beam non - linearities will provide significantly larger detuning than the results from table [ tab : dq ] .",
    "machine impedance is therefore not considered to become an issue for stability .",
    "this was confirmed by simulations as shown in the top plot of fig .",
    "[ imp ] , where the beam is fully stable with electron lenses running at half compensation .",
    "when a proton bunch interacts with the electron beam it will drive larmor oscillations of the electrons along the interaction region resulting in an @xmath17-dependent kick onto the proton bunch .",
    "this can be interpreted as an electron lens impedance comparable to or larger than the machine impedance .",
    "its strength depends on the electron lens parameters and under certain conditions can lead to transverse mode coupling instabilities ( tmci ) .",
    "this effect was studied in detail in ref .",

    "the variable @xmath24 is defined as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the relativistic @xmath27 of the electron beam , @xmath28 is the speed of light and @xmath29 is the larmor angular frequency defined as    @xmath30    using this wake function and considering uniform and equal transverse distributions for the proton and electron beams , it is possible to analytically derive the tmci threshold and hence the required solenoid field to ensure stability .",

    "this six - dimensional electron lens interaction was built into the code beambeam3d to study beam stability with an electron lens in multi - particle tracking simulations .",
    "benchmarking with theoretical predictions was done using linearized beam  beam kicks , which allows for direct comparison .",
    "figure [ el_only ] shows the results of this benchmarking using the same beam parameters as the field threshold computation from eq.([bth ] ) .",
    "the transverse mode coupling instability occurs at around 14 t , which is consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "these results only include interactions with an electron lens ; in the presence of beam  beam ( proton  proton ) interactions coherent motion is driven by these additional interactions and the mode frequencies are modified .",

    "the mode coupling instability in the presence of coherent beam  beam effects is reduced by a factor 2 for these parameters with respect to theoretical expectations without coherent beam  beam effects ( the threshold in terms of solenoid field scales with @xmath44 ) .",
    "the above simulations were carried out using a linearized model which does not include the amplitude detuning related to the non - linearities of the beam  beam force and hence its contribution to landau damping .",

    "the proton  proton interactions are computed using a poisson solver , making no assumption on the beam distribution , while the interaction with the electron lens is done assuming elliptical gaussian shapes but allowing for a tilt angle of the phase - space distribution in order to account for the coupling introduced by the solenoid field ; more detailed studies would be required to verify the validity of the gaussian approximation and its impact on landau damping .",
    "the proton bunch is sliced longitudinally into 50 slices , which correspond to 10 times the wavelength of the larmor oscillations .",
    "although the high - frequency component of the wake function should not have a significant impact on stability , it is necessary to perform systematic studies regarding the effect of the number of slices .",
    "this may introduce some aliasing issues when sampling the electron oscillations and eventual smoothing approximations could apply .",

    "the theoretical threshold was estimated to be approximately 14 t . including landau damping , this threshold is significantly reduced and stability is achieved for a solenoid field between 1 t and 6 t , which is within the rhic electron lens design .",
    "unfortunately , the degradation due to coherent beam  beam effects is also observed in the presence of landau damping and the beam could not be stabilized for a field up to 20 t , which is well above design .",

    "head - on beam  beam compensation with electron lenses reduces the beam  beam tune spread allowing one to accommodate larger bunch intensity at the current rhic working point . in return , the contribution from the beam  beam tune spread to landau damping is reduced while the coherent beam ",

    "beam @xmath1-mode was driven onto the 2/3 resonance without effect on beam stability or cross talk between beams . losses and emittance blow - up were observed in the beam moving towards the resonance , which is attributed to incoherent effects when the tune spread overlaps the resonance stop band .",

    "it was shown that the intrinsic machine non - linearities provide almost sufficient detuning to stabilize instabilities driven by machine impedance .",
    "this is consistent with experimental data , as instabilities are generally not observed in regular operation .",
    "the electron lenses are foreseen to compensate for only half of the full beam  beam tune spread .",
    "the remaining tune spread would still be significantly larger than the simulated stabilizing octupolar detuning , leading to the conclusion that machine impedance is not a limitation for operation with electron lenses .",
    "another aspect investigated in this paper is the electron lens driven tmci .",
    "it was found that the rhic design field is not sufficient to ensure stability with the current machine layout and beam parameters .",
    "a possible solution to overcome this issue would be the implementation of a bunch - by - bunch transverse damper combined with slightly higher than nominal chromaticities .",
    "these results are preliminary and more systematic studies and model refinements are required to draw final conclusions . the electron lens driven tmci",
    "could also be mitigated using beam parameters such as the distance between the horizontal and vertical tunes or the @xmath27-function at the electron lens .",
