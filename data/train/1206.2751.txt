    "an algebraic theory of the above kind is the theory of baer rings and algebras developed by kaplansky @xcite .",
    "a unital ring @xmath88 is called the baer ring , if each left ( or , equivalently , each right ) annihilator in @xmath88 is generated by an idempotent element .",
    "this property was proved by baer @xcite for the ring of all endomorphisms of a vector space of an arbitrary dimension .",

    "it is of type ii , if it has a faithful finite idempotent , but no nonzero abelian idempotents , and of type iii , if it has no nonzero finite idempotents .",
    "these classes are subdivided further into finite and infinite ones .",
    "a typical example of a type i baer ring is the ring of all linear transformations of a vector space of countable dimension . under some additional conditions , an arbitrary baer factor of type",
    "i is of this form @xcite .",
    "for other examples of baer rings see @xcite .",
    "the main result @xcite of the theory of baer rings is the unique decomposition of every baer ring into a direct sum of rings of the above types .",

    "therefore * the operator ring @xmath114 with the baer reduction is an orthogonal sum of rings with reductions of types i , ii , and iii*.    the simplest example of algebras with the baer reduction of type i is the algebra of all bounded operators on a banach space of countable type ( that is , @xmath107 with a countable set @xmath112 ) . the very existence of other operator algebras ( moreover , factors ) with this property is far from obvious . below",
