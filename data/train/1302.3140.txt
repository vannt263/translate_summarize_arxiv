    "the study of sample path continuity and hlder regularity of stochastic processes is a very active field of research in probability theory .",
    "the existing literature provides a variety of uniform results on local regularity , especially on the modulus of continuity , for rather general classes of random fields ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite on gaussian processes and @xcite for more recent developments ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of pointwise regularity is often more complex , in particular as it often happens to behave erratically as time passes .",
    "such sample path behaviour was first put into light for brownian motion by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they respectively studied _ fast _ and _ slow points _ , which characterize logarithmic variations of the pointwise modulus of continuity , and proved that the sets of times with a given pointwise regularity have a particular fractal geometry .",
    "@xcite recently extended the fast points study to fractional brownian motion .",
    "as exhibited by @xcite , lvy processes with a jump compound also display an interesting pointwise behaviour .",
    "indeed , for this class of random fields , the pointwise exponent varies randomly inside a closed interval as time passes .",
    "this seminal work has been enhanced and extended by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "particularly , the latter proves that markov processes have a range of admissible pointwise behaviours much wider than lvy processes . in the aforementioned works , _ multifractal analysis",
    "_ happens to be the key concept for the study and the characterisation of local fluctuations of pointwise regularity . in order to be more specific ,",
    "let us first recall the definition of the different notions previously outlined .",
    "a function @xmath1 belongs to @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , if there exist @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a polynomial @xmath7 of degree less than @xmath0 such that @xmath8 the _ pointwise hlder exponent _ of @xmath9 at @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 , where by convention @xmath12 .",
    "multifractal analysis is concerned with the study of the level sets of the pointwise exponent , usually called the _ iso - hlder sets _ of @xmath9 , @xmath13 to describe the geometry of the collection @xmath14 , and thereby to determine the arrangement of the hlder regularity , we are interested in the _ local spectrum of singularities _ of @xmath9 . it is usually denoted @xmath15 and defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the collection of nonempty open sets of @xmath18 and @xmath19 the hausdorff dimension ( by convention @xmath20 ) .    although @xmath14 are random sets , stochastic processes such as lvy processes @xcite , lvy processes in multifractal time @xcite and fractional brownian motion happen to have a deterministic multifractal spectrum .",
    "furthermore , these random fields are also said to be _ homogeneous _ as the hausdorff dimension @xmath21 is independent of the set @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "when the pointwise exponent is constant along sample paths , the spectrum is described as _ degenerate _ , i.e. its support is reduced to a single point ( e.g. the hurst exponent in the case of f.b.m . ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite provided examples of respectively markov jump processes and wavelet random series with non - homogeneous and random spectrum of singularities .    as stated in equations and , classic multifractal analysis deals with the study of the variations of pointwise regularity",
    "unfortunately , it is known that common hlder exponents ( local and pointwise as well ) do not give a complete picture of the local regularity ( see e.g the deterministic chirp function @xmath24 detailed in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , they also lack of stability under the action of pseudo - differential operators .    _",
    "2-microlocal analysis _ is one natural way to overcome these issues and obtain a more precise description of the local regularity .",
    "it has first been introduced by @xcite in the deterministic frame to study properties of generalized solutions of pde .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite developed a stochastic approach based on this framework to investigate the finer regularity of stochastic processes such as gaussian processes , martingales and stochastic integrals . in order to the study sample path properties in this frame ,",
    "we need to recall the concept of _",
    "space_.    [ def:2ml_spaces ] let @xmath3 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "a function @xmath1 belongs to the _ 2-microlocal space _",
    "if there exist @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a polynomial @xmath7 such that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .    the time - domain characterisation of 2-microlocal spaces has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "the original definition given by @xcite relies on the littlewood - paley decomposition of tempered distributions , and thereby corresponds to a description in the fourier space .",
    "another characterisation based on wavelet expansion has also been exhibited by @xcite .",
    "the extension of definition [ def:2ml_spaces ] to @xmath31 relies on the following important property satisfied by 2-microlocal spaces ( see theorem @xmath32 in @xcite ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 designates the fractional integral of @xmath9 of order @xmath0 . as a consequence of",
    ", the application of equation to iterated integrals or differentials of @xmath9 provides an extension of definition [ def:2ml_spaces ] to any @xmath35 , which is sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",
    "similarly to the pointwise hlder exponent , the introduction of 2-microlocal spaces leads naturaly to the definition of regularity tool named the _",
    "2-microlocal frontier _ and given by @xmath36 2-microlocal spaces enjoy several inclusion properties which imply that the map @xmath37 is well - defined and display the following features :    * @xmath38 is a concave non - decreasing function ; * @xmath38 has left and right derivatives between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    as a function , the 2-microlocal frontier @xmath38 offers a more complete description of the local regularity .",
    "in particular , it embraces the local hlder exponent since @xmath41 . furthermore , as stated in @xcite , if the modulus of continuity of @xmath9 satisfies @xmath42 , the pointwise exponent can also be retrieved using the formula @xmath43 .",
    "note that the previous formula can not directly deduced from equation [ eq : def_2ml_spaces ] since definition [ def:2ml_spaces ] does not stand when @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite provides an example of generalized function which does not satisfy this relation .",
    "as observed @xcite , brownian motion provides a simple instance of 2-microlocal frontier in the stochastic frame : almost surely for all @xmath3 , @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46    in this paper , the 2-microlocal approach is combined with the classic use of multifractal analysis to obtain a finer description of the regularity of stochastic processes . following the path of @xcite ,",
    "we refine the multifractal description of lvy processes ( section [ sec:2ml_levy ] ) and observe in particular that the use of the 2-microlocal formalism allows to capture subtle behaviours that can not be characterized by the classic spectrum of singularities .",
    "this finer analysis of sample path properties of lvy processes happens to be very useful for the study of another class of processes named linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) .",
    "the lfsm is a common @xmath0-stable self - similar process with stationary increments , and can be seen as an extension of the fractional brownian motion to the non - gaussian frame .",
    "since it also has long range dependence and heavy tails , it is of great interest in modelling . in section [ sec:2ml_lfsm ]",
    ", we completely characterize the multifractal nature of the lfsm , and thereby illustrate the fact that 2-microlocal analysis is well - suited to study the regularity of unbounded sample paths as well as continuous ones .      as it is well known , an @xmath47-valued lvy process @xmath48 has stationary and independent increments .",
    "its law is determined by the lvy - khintchine formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) : for all @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 } } = e^{t\\psi(\\lambda)}$ ] where @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 @xmath54 is a non - negative symmetric matrix and @xmath55 a lvy measure , i.e. a positive radon measure on @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .    throughout this paper",
    ", it will always be assumed that @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise , the lvy process simply corresponds to the sum of a compound poisson process with drift and a brownian motion whose regularity can be simply deduced .",
    "sample path properties of lvy processes are known to depend on the growth of the lvy measure near the origin .",

    "@xcite proved that @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",

    "@xcite studied the spectrum of singularities of lvy processes under the following assumption on the measure @xmath55 , @xmath65 under the hypothesis , theorem 1 in @xcite states that the multifractal spectrum of a lvy process @xmath66 is almost surely equal to @xmath67}}.    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] note that equation still holds when @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite extended this result to hausdorff @xmath69-measures , where @xmath69 is a gauge function , and @xcite generalized the study to multivariate lvy fields .",

    "the collection of sets @xmath71 illustrates the fact that 2-microlocal analysis can capture particular behaviours that are not necessarily described by a classic multifractal spectrum .",
