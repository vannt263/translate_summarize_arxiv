    "a standard shock model of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows has now been well established , in which the grb outflow ( jet ) drives a relativistic expanding blast - wave that sweeps up and heats the grb ambient medium to produce the long - term x - ray , optical and radio afterglow by synchrotron / inverse - compton ( ic ) emission ( see zhang & 2004 or piran 2004 for recent reviews ) .",
    "the remarkable supernova signature in grb 030329 afterglow ( hjorth 2003 ) has confirmed that grbs , at least the long - duration ones , are originated from explosions of massive stars .",
    "their progenitors are believed to form black hole - disk systems in their cores , and produce double - sided jets , which are responsible for the grb emission , along the spinning axis of the black hole ( 2002 ) . for the observed hard grb photons to escape freely ,",
    "avoiding electron / positron pair formation , the outflows are reguired to be ultra - relativistic with lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "because of the relativistic beaming effect , the grb emission is confined in a narrow cone , and can only be observed when the light of sight is within the cone .",
    "interestingly , it was this beaming effect that made many authors expect the present of `` orphan afterglows '' ( rhoads 1997 ; dalal , griest , & pruet 2002 ; granot 2002 ; granot & loeb 2003 ) which correspond to off - axis grbs without gamma - rays associated , but with afterglows detected when the shocks decelerate .    the previous works , except for granot & loeb ( 2003 ) , only discussed the emission from the preceding jet ( pj ) , which is pointing toward us , and neglected that from the other receding jet ( rj ) , since it always points away from us .",
    "however , in this letter we discuss specially the emission from the rj , which will emerge when the rj become non - relativistic ( nr ) and the radiation becomes isotropic . because of the light travel time delay , the rj contribution will overlay above the late - time , already decayed pj emission . in the nr phase the afterglow peak emission has moved to radio frequencies , so the re - brightening from the rj",
    "is only expected in late - time radio afterglows .",
    "we predict the late - time radio re - brightening ( rrb ) of grb 030329 and discuss the long - term radio observations for two grbs 970508 and 980703 .",
    "the observation of rrbs will be particularly important due to its straightforward implication of the existence of double - sided jets in grbs .",
    "consider two collimated jets , that are ejected in opposite directions from the central engine of a grb .",
    "for an observed grb , the observer should be almost on the jet axis .",
    "we assume the two jets have the same characteristics , such as the half opening angle @xmath6 , the initial lorentz factor @xmath7 , and the kinetic energy @xmath8 ( or with equivalent isotropic energy @xmath9 ) .",
    "since most afterglow fits seem to favor a uniform medium ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , we assume a constant particle density @xmath3 for both jets .    in the above assumptions we have take the standard view of a homogeneous jet with sharp edge ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "recently , a structured jet model ( 1998 ; dai & gou 2001 ; rossi 2002 ; zhang & 2002 ) was proposed , but detailed fits to afterglow data are still needed to determine whether it is consistent with current observations ( granot & kumar 2003 ) . since the standard jet model have been well successful in the data fits ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , we only discuss homogeneous jets here .",
    "we first discuss the pj .",
    "the pj evolution can be divided into four phases .",
    "( 1 ) initially , @xmath10 , the transverse size of the jet is larger than that of the causally connected region , therefore the jet evolves as if it was a conical section of a spherical relativistic blast wave .",
    "the pj undergoes first a coasting phase with @xmath11 .",
    "( 2 ) after the jet - induced shock sweeps up enough medium , the jet kinetic energy is mostly transferred into the shocked medium , and the jet begins to decelerate significantly .",
    "this occurs at the deceleration radius @xmath12 at an observer time @xmath13 , where a relation @xmath14 has been taken for surperluminal motion . at the deceleration phase",
    ", the dynamics could be well described by the blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) self - similar solution , where @xmath15 .",
    "( 3 ) as the jet continues to decelerate , the lorentz factor drops to @xmath16 at a time @xmath17 , corresponding to a radius @xmath18 . from the time on the transverse size of causally connected regions",
    "exceeds that of the jet , therefore the sphere approximation breaks down , and the jet starts expanding sideways .",
    "the dynamical evolution in this stage depends on the degree of sideways expansion .",
    "if the lateral velocity in the comoving frame equals to the local sound speed , the jet will spread quickly with the opening angle increasing and @xmath19 dropping exponentially ( rhoads 1999 ) . at this stage ,",
    "the radius hardly increases and may be regarded as a constant @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "( 4 ) finally the jet goes into nr phase with @xmath22 at @xmath23 , where the evolution can be well described by sedov - taylor solution @xmath24 , with @xmath25 . in summary ,",
    "the evolution is : @xmath26 using the above simplified dynamical relation , the nr time and radius , defined as where @xmath27 , are able to be calculated as @xmath28 they are independent of @xmath7 and @xmath6 . with typical values @xmath29  ergs and @xmath30  @xmath31 ( e.g. , frail 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , we have @xmath32 note that this @xmath1 refers to the pj .    as for the rj , it also transits into nr phase at a radius @xmath33",
    ". however , due to the light travel time the observer time epoch is delayed by a time @xmath34 , so the observed nr time for the rj is @xmath35 5 times that of the pj .",
    "there are uncertainties about the lateral spreading of jets , and it might be that little spreading occurs , as shown in some numerical simulations ( e.g. , cannizzo 2004 ) . if we assume the extreme case that the lateral velocity is zero , then the jet remains conical geometry and continues to evolve as if it was a conical section of a spherical relativistic blast wave after @xmath36 .",
    "in this case , the nr time for the pj is @xmath37  d , with @xmath38 , and the corresponding radius is @xmath39 , therefore for the rj , the nr time is @xmath40  yr .",
    "these may be regarded as upper limits , while the values in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nr]-[eq : rjtnr ] ) for the fastest spreading cases as lower limits .      for the detailed discussion of afterglow emission in nr phase",
    ", the readers might refer to frail , waxman & kulkarni ( 2000 ) , livio & waxman ( 2000 ) and waxman ( 2004 ) , we here only give brief introduction .",
    "consider also the pj emission first .",
    "after @xmath1 , the evolution is described by the spherical nr self - similar evolution , with the pj radius given by @xmath41 , and the swept - up particle number is @xmath42 .",
    "simply assume that the shocked material forms a thin and uniform shell , with the width @xmath43 and the post - shock thermal energy density @xmath44 .",
    "the electron and magnetic - field energy densities are assumed to be constant fraction @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , of the post - shock thermal energy density @xmath47 .",
    "the electrons are believed to be accelerated to form a power law distribution , @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "based on the above assumptions , it can be found that the magnetic field strength and the minimum electron lorentz factor evolve as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the accelerated electrons will give rise to synchrotron emission .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron frequency of electrons with @xmath52 is @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the peak specific luminosity is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the synchrotron power of an electron with @xmath52 .",
    "the observed radio frequency is usually beyond @xmath59 at nr stage , the specific luminosity is therefore @xmath60 , and given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 has been taken .",
    "the nr light curve flattens , compared with the decay , @xmath63 , in the spreading phase ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "as for the rj , when it is still relativistic the emission is always beamed away from us and hence invisible . at the time @xmath64 after the grb ,",
    "the rj becomes non - relativistic and the emission becomes isotropic .",
    "the observed rj luminosity at this point should be comparable to that of the pj at @xmath1 , because of the same characteristics of the pj and rj .",
    "if neglect the nr jet velocity with respect to the light speed , the time delay between the emission from the pj and rj could be roughly fixed as @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 is not @xmath67 ) .",
    "the rj specific luminosity , then , could be written as , for @xmath68 , @xmath69 a schematic plot is given in figure 1 for both pj and rj radio light curves .",
    "after rapid increase in flux , the rj emission reaches the peak at around @xmath64 , and then decreases as a delayed light curve of the nr - phase pj , but showing a steeper decline in the logarithmic plot .",
    "note that the transition to nr phase might be gradual , and the jet edge might be not sharp , therefore both these can smooth the rrb feature on the plot .",
    "as discussed above , if a grb can be monitored for a long time in radio bands , e.g. , a few years , the rrb may be able to be detected .",
    "so far , there are two grbs that have been reported in the literatures with radio monitoring longer than one year : grb 970508 and grb 980703 ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ; berger , kulkarni & frail 2001 ; frail 2003 ) .",
    "frail , waxman & kulkarni ( 2000 ) report an extensive monitoring of the radio afterglow of grb 970508 , lasting 450 days after the burst . in the data analysis they found that the spectral and temporal radio behavior indicate a transition to nr expansion at @xmath70  d , therefore , we should expect the rrb at around day 500 . however , this is unfortunately behind the last observation of this burst , so we might have missed that apparent phenomena .",
    "grb 980703 was monitored even longer , up to @xmath71  d , as shown in figure 1 of frail ( 2003 ) .",
    "two obvious flattening appear in the radio light curves : while the late - time transition to a constant flux is thought to be the host galaxy contribution , the earlier flattening at @xmath72  d is attributed to the transition into nr expansion ( berger , kulkarni & frail 2001 ) . modelling the @xmath19 evolution",
    "has also inferred a similar value of @xmath73  d ( frail 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the expected rrb should arise at @xmath74  d , and then after another time interval of 200  d , around 400  d from the burst , the radio flux should decline to a value similar to just before the rrb . at first glance of figure 1 of frail ( 2003 )",
    ", the radio light curves , somewhat more extensive at 8.5 and 4.8  ghz , seem to show only decays without any re - brightening .",
    "however , we notice that there is no observation data collected between 210  d and @xmath75  d , therefore the rrb may be missed once again due to the lack of observation .",
    "grb 030329 is the nearest cosmological burst ( @xmath76 ) , and has a bright afterglow at all wavelengths .",
    "berger ( 2003 ) have reported its bright radio afterglow up to @xmath77  d after the burst .",
    "since no radio flattening ( due to transition to nr evolution ) appears yet , we should calculate @xmath1 using @xmath78 derived from available data .",
    "the early breaks ( @xmath79  d ) in the r band ( price 2003 ) and x - ray ( tiengo 2004 ) light curves infer a small jet opening angle , leading to a small jet - corrected energy release in grb 030329 , which is more than one order of magnitude below the average value around which most grbs are narrowly clustered ( frail 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "two models have been proposed to solve this problem : a refreshed - shock model with 10 times more energy injected later ( granot , nakar & piran 2003 ) ; and a two - component model with most energy in a wider jet component ( berger 2003 ) .",
    "both models have the same result : the kinetic energy corresponding to the late - time radio afterglow is typical for all grbs . based mainly on the early multi - frequency data , a typical value for medium density , @xmath30  @xmath31 , was also derived by willingale ( 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , the estimated value of @xmath1 should be typical as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnr ] ) , hence @xmath80  d. in fact , the radio angular size measurement of this burst shows relativistic expanding 83  d after the burst ( taylor 2004 ) , consistent with the estimation here .",
    "in addition , berger ( 2003 ) have inferred @xmath81 from a snapshot spectrum at @xmath82  d , where @xmath83  hz is the cooling frequency .",
    "this parameter value leads to a too early nr phase , @xmath84  d ( from eq .",
    "[ eq : tnr ] ) , conflicted with the observed superluminal expansion ( taylor 2004 ) . however , in the parameter derivation , the assumption of jet break time at @xmath82  d might be incorrect , because the millimeter observation shows that the light curves have already steepened at @xmath85  d at both 100 and 250  ghz ( sheth 2003 ) , implying that @xmath86  d. moreover , the angular size evolution can also give constraints to the model parameters .",
    "for grb 030329 , granot , ramirez - ruiz & loeb ( 2004 ) derive @xmath87 ( see also oren , nakar & piran 2004 ) from the observation by taylar ( 2004 ) .",
    "this yields a later transition at @xmath88  d.    we will take the more reasonable value @xmath89  d ( it should be noticed that this might still be the lower limit since the most rapid sideways spreading has been assumed ) , and hence the expected rrb should arise at @xmath90  yr after grb 030329 , with the fluxes comparable to that at the time @xmath1 . assuming the same temporal slope for late time , an extrapolation of the available radio light curves ( berger 2003 ) to @xmath91  d gives a flux @xmath4  mjy at 15  ghz , or @xmath92  mjy at 44  ghz .",
    "dense monitoring campaign around @xmath90  yr after grb 030329 is required to obtain a well - observed rrb profile .",
    "in this work we suggest that rrbs are common for grbs with double - sided jets , which come from the rj transition to nr evolution .",
    "if we assume the same properties for both pj and rj and also for the ambient medium on both sides , the rrb would arise at a time @xmath93  yr after the burst , with a flux comparable to that at the time @xmath1 .",
    "after @xmath64 , the afterglow behaves as a delayed emission of that behind @xmath1 , with the time lag of @xmath94 ( eq . [ eq : lnurj ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , no radio data could be collected when rrbs occur for grb 970508 and grb 980703 , two longest observed grbs so far .",
    "we suppose the rrb of grb 030329 around 1.7  yr after the burst with @xmath4  ( 0.3 )  mjy at 15  ( 44 )  ghz , and urge dense monitoring campaign during that time . it should be noticed that for weak jet - spreading , the rrb might be more delayed since @xmath64 is much larger ( see in the end of  2.1 ) .    there has been growing evidence for collimated jets in grbs over the past several years , which is coming mainly from observations of achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 1999 ; stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , there are still other explanations for the light curve breaks , for example , the transition from the relativistic to nr phase of the blast wave at a few days due to highly dense medium ( dai & lu 1999 ; wang , dai & lu 2000 ) ; the effects of ic scattering flattening or steepening the light curves ( wei & lu 2000 ) ; a sudden drop in the external density ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) ; a break in the energy spectrum of radiating electrons ( li & chevalier 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "though black hole - disk system with twin jets is generally assumed in grbs , magnetized , rapidly rotating neutron stars remain contenders , and an off - center dipole could lead to a one - sided jet . since rrbs are only associated with collimated , double - sided , relativistic outflows , the detection of rrbs would provide straightforward evidence of double - sided jets in grbs , and prove the black hole - disk system formation in the cores of progenitors .",
    "this make rrb observations significantly important ."
