    "in recent years a lot of effort has been devoted to measure gravitomagnetic effects due to earth s rotation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite predicted by the theory of general relativity ( gr )",
    ". in particular , the lense - thirring effect on the orbital motion of a test body can be measured by using the satellite laser ranging ( slr ) technique , whose data are provided by the ilrs . by analyzing the laser ranging data of the orbits of the satellites lageos and lageos ii , a measurement of the lense - thirring effect was obtained by ciufolini and pavlis @xcite .",
    "slr missions can also be useful to test modifications of gr , such as torsion theories of gravity .",
    "a class of theories allowing the presence of torsion is based on riemann - cartan spacetime , which is endowed with a metric @xmath0 and a compatible connection .",
    "the resulting connection @xmath1 turns out to be nonsymmetric , and therefore it originates a non - vanishing torsion tensor .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite for the details .    in standard torsion theories",
    "the source of torsion is considered to be the intrinsic spin of matter @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which is negligible when averaged over a macroscopic body .",
    "therefore spacetime torsion would be observationally negligible in the solar system . nevertheless , in @xcite mao , tegmark",
    ", guth and cabi ( mtgc ) argue that the presence of detectable torsion in the solar system should be tested experimentally , rather than derived by means of a specific torsion model . for this reason , in @xcite a theory - independent framework based on symmetry arguments is developed , and it is determined by a set @xmath2 of seven parameters describing torsion and three further parameters @xmath3 describing the metric . here , by theory - independent framework , we mean the following : the metric and the connection are parametrized , around a massive body , with the help of symmetry arguments , without reference to a torsion model based on a specific lagrangian ( or even on specific field equations ) .    this parametrized framework can be used to constrain @xmath2 from solar system experiments . in particular",
    ", mtgc suggest that gpb @xcite is an appropriate experiment for this task , and in @xcite they compute precessions of gyroscopes and put constraints on torsion parameters from gpb measurements . in hehl and obukhov",
    "argue that measuring torsion requires intrinsic spin , and criticize the approach of mtgc , since gpb gyroscopes do not carry uncompensated elementary particle spin .",
    "nevertheless , we accept the general idea that the precise form of the coupling of torsion to matter should be tested experimentally , and that actual experimental knowledge leaves room for nonstandard torsion theories which could yield detectable torsion signals in the solar system . in the present paper",
    "we apply the parametrized framework developed by mtgc for the computation of satellites orbits around earth and we put a different set of constraints on torsion parameters from slr measurements .",
    "mtgc also address the question of whether there exists a specific gravitational lagrangian fitting in the parametrized framework and yielding a torsion signal detectable by the gpb experiment . as an example they quote the theory of hayashi and shirafuji ( hs ) in @xcite where a massive body generates a torsion field , and they propose what they call the einstein - hayashi - shirafuji ( ehs ) lagrangian , interpolating gr and hs lagrangians in a linear way .",
    "however , mtgc consider only a gravitational lagrangian in vacuum , so that they can not derive the equations of motion of test bodies from the gravitational field equations , which would require a suitable matter coupling .",
    "the ehs model has been criticized by various authors . in the paper @xcite , flanagan and rosenthal",
    "show that the linearized ehs theory becomes consistent only if the coefficients in the lagrangian are constrained in such a way that the resulting predictions coincide with those of gr . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "puetzfeld and obukhov derive the equations of motion in the framework of metric - affine gravity theories , which includes the hs theory , and show that only test bodies with microstructure ( such as spin ) can couple to torsion . in conclusion , the ehs theory does not yield a torsion signal detectable for gpb . for these reasons , in @xcite the ehs lagrangian is proposed not as a viable physical model , but as a pedagogical toy model fitting in the parametrized framework , and giving an illustration of the constraints that can be imposed on torsion by the gpb experiment . in the present paper",
    "we will not consider such a toy model .",
    "as also remarked by flanagan and rosenthal in @xcite , the failure of constructing the specific ehs lagrangian does not rule out the possibility that there may exist other torsion theories which could be usefully constrained by solar system experiments .",
    "such torsion models should fit in the above mentioned theory - independent framework , similarly to a parametrized post - newtonian framework including torsion .",
    "we remark that the parametrized formalism of mtgc does not take into account the intrinsic spin of matter as a possible source of torsion , and in this sense it can not be a general torsion framework .",
    "however , it is adequate for the description of torsion around macroscopic massive bodies in the solar system , like planets , being the intrinsic spin negligible when averaged over such bodies",
    ".    therefore we think it is worthwhile to continue the investigation of observable effects in the solar system of nonstandard torsion models within the mtgc parametrized formalism , under suitable working assumptions .",
    "in particular , our aim is to extend the gpb gyroscopes computations made in @xcite to the case of motion of satellites .    in the present paper",
    "we compute the corrections to the orbital lense - thirring effect due to the presence of spacetime torsion described by @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the motion of a test body in the gravitational field of a rotating axisymmetric massive body , under the assumption of slow motion of the test body .",
    "since we use a parametrized framework without specifying the coupling of torsion to matter , we can not derive the equations of motion of test bodies from the gravitational field equations .",
    "therefore , in order to compute effects of torsion on the orbits of satellites , we will work out the implications of the assumption that the trajectory of a test body is either an extremal or an autoparallel curve .",
    "such trajectories do not need to coincide when torsion is present .",
    "as in the original paper of lense and thirring @xcite , we characterize the motion using the six orbital elements of the osculating ellipse . in terms of these orbital elements ,",
    "the equations of motion then reduce to the lagrangian planetary equations .",
    "we calculate the secular variations of the longitude @xmath4 of the node and of the longitude @xmath5 of the pericenter .",
    "the computed secular variations show how the corrections to the orbital lense - thirring effect depend on the torsion parameters , and it turns out that the dependence is only through @xmath6 .",
    "the data from the lageos satellites are then used to constrain the relevant linear combinations of the torsion parameters .",
    "more precisely , we constrain two different linear combinations of @xmath7 by using first the measurements of the nodes of lageos and lageos ii , and then the measurements of the nodes of lageos and lageos ii and of the perigee of lageos ii . in particular , torsion parameters can not be constrained by satellite experiments in the case of extremal trajectories .",
    "while the torsion perturbations to the lense - thirring effect depend only on @xmath8 , it turns out that another relevant relativistic effect , namely the geodetic precession ( or de sitter effect ) , depends on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and on a further parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this latter parameter is involved in a higher order parametrization of torsion , which is necessary for the description of the geodetic precession effect , while it is not necessary at the order of accuracy required in the present paper .",
    "all computations of orbital geodetic precession with torsion of a satellite are performed in the companion paper @xcite , to which we will sometimes refer for details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spator ] we briefly recall the notion of spacetime with torsion . in section [ sec : geodet ] we discuss the case of extremal trajectories . in section",
    "[ sec : autopa ] we analyze the equations of autoparallel trajectories and derive the related system of ordinary differential equations to first order .",
    "the expression of the system clearly reveals the perturbation due to torsion with respect to the lense - thirring equations . in section [ sec : comput ] we derive the time evolution of the orbital elements , by applying the classical perturbation theory of celestial mechanics , in particular the gauss form of the lagrange planetary equations . in section",
    "[ sec : correz ] we calculate the secular variations of the orbital elements . in section [ sec : desitter ] we recall some results from @xcite where torsion solar perturbations are computed .",
    "these results will be used in section [ sec : simone ] , where we give the observational constraints that the lageos experiment can place on torsion parameters .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclus ] .",
    "for convenience of the reader , in the appendix ( section [ sec : append ] ) we recall from @xcite how to parametrize the metric and torsion tensors , and hence how to parametrize the connection , under suitable symmetry assumptions .",
    "a manifold equipped with a lorentzian metric @xmath12 and a connection @xmath13 compatible with the metric is called a riemann - cartan spacetime @xcite , @xcite .",
    "compatibility means that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "we recall in particular that for any vector field @xmath16 @xmath17 the connection is determined uniquely by @xmath12 and by the torsion tensor @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the levi - civita connection , defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the contortion tensor . in the particular case",
    "when @xmath23 is symmetric with respect to @xmath24 the torsion tensor vanishes .",
    "we will be concerned here with the case of nonsymmetric connections @xmath25 .",
    "the case of vanishing torsion tensor corresponds to riemann spacetime of gr , while the case of vanishing riemann tensor corresponds to the weitzenbck spacetime @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we use the natural gravitational units @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume that earth can be approximated as a uniformly rotating spherical object of mass @xmath28 and angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "following @xcite , we use spherical coordinates @xmath30 for a satellite moving in the gravitational field of earth , and we introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 . since the radii of the lageos orbits ( about 6000 km altitude ) are much larger than earth s schwarzschild radius , it follows that @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , since earth is slowly rotating , we have @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , all computations will be carried out perturbatively to first order in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    under spherical axisymmetry assumptions ,",
    "the metric tensor @xmath12 and the torsion tensor @xmath37 have been parametrized to first order in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath12 is parametrized by three parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath37 is parametrized by seven parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 therefore @xmath43 becomes an explicit function of all metric and torsion parameters .",
    "it turns out that @xmath44 contribute to geodetic precession , while @xmath7 contribute to the frame - dragging precession . in the appendix",
    "we report the explicit expressions of the parametrized metric and torsion tensors , and of the connection , that will be needed in the sequel of the paper .",
    "in gr structureless test bodies move along geodesics . in a riemann - cartan spacetime",
    "there are two different classes of curves , autoparallel and extremal curves , respectively , which reduce to the geodesics of riemann spacetime when torsion is zero @xcite .",
    "autoparallels are curves along which the velocity vector is transported parallel to itself by the connection @xmath45 .",
    "extremals are curves of extremal length with respect to the metric @xmath12 . the velocity vector is transported parallel to itself along extremal curves by the levi - civita connection . in gr",
    "the two types of trajectories coincide while , in general , they may differ in presence of torsion .",
    "they are identical when the torsion is totally antisymmetric @xcite , a condition which is not satisfied within our parametrization .",
    "the equations of motion of bodies in the gravitational field follow from the field equations due to the bianchi identities .",
    "the method of papapetrou @xcite can be used to derive the equations of motion of a test body with internal structure , such as for instance a small extended object that may have either rotational angular momentum or net spin . in standard torsion theories",
    "the trajectories of test bodies with internal structure , in general , are neither autoparallels nor extremals @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while structureless test bodies , such as spinless test particles , follow extremal trajectories .",
    "the precise form of the equations of motion of bodies in the gravitational field depends on the way the matter couples to the metric and the torsion in the lagrangian ( or in the gravitational field equations ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we do not specify a coupling of torsion to matter , hence we do not specify the field equations . moreover , in our computations of orbits of a satellite ( considered as a test body ) , we will neglect its internal structure . in a theory - independent framework we can not derive the equations of motion from the gravitational field equations , hence we need some working assumptions on the trajectories of structureless test bodies : we will investigate the consequences of the assumption that the trajectories are either extremal or autoparallel curves . assuming the trajectory to be an extremal is natural and consistent with standard torsion theories .",
    "however , extremals depend only on the parameters of the metric , so that new predictions related to torsion can not arise . we will quickly report the computations for the sake of completeness , since the metric parameters can be immediately related to the parametrized post newtonian ( ppn ) parameters ( see ) , and the orbital lense - thirring effect in the case of extremal trajectories and a ppn metric is known .",
    "the system of equations of extremal trajectories reads as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the proper time . for slow motion of the satellite we can make the substitution @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the velocity of the satellite is small enough so that we can neglect the quadratic terms in the velocity .",
    "then , being @xmath51 we have @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "all perturbations considered here are so small that can be superposed linearly . since we are only interested in the perturbations due to earth s rotation , as in the original lense - thirring paper @xcite we are allowed to neglect the quadratic terms in the velocities which yield an advance of the perigee of the satellite .",
    "the value of the advance of the perigee for an extremal orbit and a ppn metric can be found in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 7 , formula ( 7.54 ) ) .",
    "we use for @xmath54 spherical coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "the levi - civita connection @xmath20 can be obtained from the expression of @xmath13 given in the appendix by setting to zero all torsion parameters @xmath55 .",

    "we now transform in rectangular coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we compute the second derivatives of @xmath63 with respect to time in the approximation of slow motion . neglecting all terms containing squares and products of first derivatives with respect to @xmath30 , we get @xmath64 using and we obtain the following system for the equations of motion : @xmath65 , \\\\ \\\\",

    "however , new predictions related to torsion may arise when considering the autoparallel trajectories . in the following",
    "we give some motivations which make worthwhile the investigation of autoparallel trajectories .",
    "since in spacetime with torsion parallelograms are in general not closed , but exhibit a closure failure proportional to the torsion , kleinert and pelster argue in @xcite that the variational procedure in the action principle for the motion of structureless test bodies must be modified . in the standard variational procedure for finding the extrema of the action , paths are varied keeping the endpoints fixed in such a way that variations form closed paths . however",
    ", in the formalism of @xcite , the closure failure makes the variation at the final point nonzero , and this gives rise to a force due to torsion . when this argument is applied to the action principle for structureless test bodies it turns out that the resulting torsion force changes extremal trajectories to autoparallel ones ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "kleinert and shabanov find an analogous result in @xcite where they show that the geometry of spacetime with torsion can be induced by embedding its curves in a euclidean space without torsion .",
    "kleinert et al . also argue in @xcite , @xcite that autoparallel trajectories are consistent with the principle of inertia , since a structureless test body will change its direction in a minimal way at each time , so that the trajectory is as straight as possible .    the approach of kleinert et al .",
    "has been criticized by hehl and obukhov in since the equations of autoparallel trajectories have not been derived from the energy - momentum conservation laws .",
    "kleinert investigates this issue in @xcite and finds that , due to the closure failure , the energy - momentum tensor of spinless point particles satisfies a different conservation law with respect to the one satisfied in torsion theories such as @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the resulting conservation law yields autoparallel trajectories for spinless test particles .",
    "kleinert then addresses the question of whether this new conservation law allows for the construction of an extension of einstein field equations to spacetime with torsion .",
    "the author gives an answer for the case of torsion derived from a scalar potential ( see @xcite for a discussion of this kind of torsion ) . in this case",
    "the autoparallel trajectories are derived from the gravitational field equations via the bianchi identities , though the field equation for the scalar field , which is the potential of torsion , is unknown .    in @xcite dereli and tucker",
    "show that the theory of brans - dicke can be reformulated as a field theory on a spacetime with dynamic torsion determined by the gradient of the brans - dicke scalar field .",
    "then in @xcite they suggest that the autoparallel trajectory of a spinless test particle in such a torsion geometry is a possibility that has to be taken into account . in @xcite",
    "the autoparallel trajectories of massive spinless test particles are analyzed in the background of a spherically symmetric , static solution to the brans - dicke theory and the results are applied to the computations of the orbit of mercury . in @xcite the autoparallel trajectories of spinless particles are analyzed in the background of a kerr brans - dicke geometry . in @xcite , @xcite the equations of autoparallel trajectories are derived from the gravitational field equations and bianchi identities , in the special case of matter modeled as a pressureless fluid , and torsion expressed solely in terms of the gradient of the brans - dicke scalar field .",
    "the above quoted results show that there is an interest in the autoparallels in spacetime with torsion , which make worthwhile their investigation in the present paper .",
    "the system of equations of autoparallels reads as @xmath76 where @xmath47 is the proper time @xcite .",
    "observe that only the symmetric part @xmath77 of the connection enters in ; moreover , starting from the totally antisymmetric part of @xmath78 can not be measured .",
    "the trajectory of a test body has to be a time - like curve . since the connection is compatible with the metric , the quantity @xmath79 is conserved by parallel transport .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath80 to the trajectory undergoes parallel transport by the connection along the autoparallel .",
    "therefore , an autoparallel that is time - like at one point has this same orientation everywhere , so that the trajectory is strictly contained in the light cone determined by @xmath12 , in a neighbourhood of every of its points .",
