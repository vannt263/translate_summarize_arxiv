    "methods based on the mean - field approach represent the tool of choice for the study of all atomic nuclei but the lightest .",
    "a fairly good approximation of the mass and size of doubly magic heavy nuclei can be obtained at the mean - field level , often called the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , while the properties of other nuclei can be obtained by using a hierarchy of refinements from the inclusion of pairing correlations to the description of the fluctuations of collective degrees of freedom using the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) and projection techniques ( for symmetry restoration ) .    the key object",
    "to build is the energy density functional ( edf ) .",
    "usually , its expression is derived from an effective interaction like the gogny@xcite or skyrme@xcite ones that depend on a small number of parameters .",
    "the skyrme interaction being of zero - range type , the obtained edf depends on local densities only when the usual slater approximation is adopted for the coulomb contribution .",
    "the calculation of the average value of the skyrme interaction in a vacuum that is a product of occupied quasiparticle states generates all the terms of the functional in a consistent way , _",
    "i.e. _ the contributions of the normal and anomalous ( pairing ) densities as well as the contributions of the time - even and time - odd densities .    on the one hand ,",
    "the effective character of this approach justifies the omission of certain terms in the functional ( as , for example , the so called `` @xmath0 '' terms ) or the use of different parameters for its normal and pairing parts .",
    "moreover , since most of the time , the procedures used to adjust the parameters of the skyrme interaction use only informations from time - even systems , one can also neglect several time - odd terms in the functional .",
    "when such a choice is done , the backward link between the functional and an effective interaction is broken .",
    "on the other hand , it was recently realized that the use of a functional not exactly derived from an effective interaction leads to spurious contributions in the energy in calculations beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "these spurious contributions can be removed using a procedure recently formulated.@xcite it was also shown that if the effective interaction does depend on non integer powers of the density , other spurious contributions pollutes the energy in beyond mean - field calculations and the aforementioned correction procedure can not be used.@xcite    the use of a single effective interaction with only integer powers of the density ( or with explicit three and four body interactions ) to generate all the terms of the functional would be the ideal choice to avoid or to be able to handle correctly the pathologies in beyond mean - field calculations .",
    "such interactions do not exist at this moment and their developments are only at their early stages.@xcite    the present work is devoted to the study of finite size spin and isospin instabilities in nuclei that appear at the mean - field level .",
    "we use a set of effective interactions that are built following the same protocol as the one used for the famous sly interactions.@xcite these interactions are supplemented by an effective two - body zero range tensor term .",
    "since only doubly magic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter in its normal phase are calculated , the choice for the interaction in the pairing channel is not in question here .",
    "the parts of the functional that depend on the time - odd densities are obtained from the effective interaction and are all kept in the calculations . having",
    "a non - integer power of the isoscalar density @xmath1 in the density dependent term is not a problem since we do not perform beyond - mean - field calculations here .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : pp ] we present and discuss the form of the skyrme interaction used in this study and its parameters fitting procedure is recalled in section  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "examples of finite size instabilities are shown in section  [ sec : inst ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : lr ] , the linear response formalism is briefly exposed and its ability to predict and avoid the regions in the parameters space that lead to instabilities is demonstrated .",
    "the interactions and functionals used in this article to illustrate the appearance of finite size instabilities are : ( i ) a serie of functionals obtained by modifying only one coefficient on the functional derived from the sly5 interaction@xcite and leaving the other coefficients unchanged ; ( ii ) the serie of t@xmath2 interactions built for the study of the effect of tensor couplings on the properties of even - even nuclei.@xcite    in the t@xmath2 intaractions , the central and spin - orbit parts are of the same form as for the sly interactions , the tensor part being @xmath3 + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,t_o\\left\\ { \\left[3 \\left(\\boldsymbol\\sigma_1\\cdot\\mathbf k'\\right)\\delta(\\mathbf r ) \\left(\\boldsymbol\\sigma_2\\cdot\\mathbf k\\right ) -\\left(\\boldsymbol\\sigma_1\\cdot\\boldsymbol\\sigma_2\\right)\\mathbf k ' \\cdot\\delta(\\mathbf r)\\mathbf k \\right ] + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\right\\}\\ , , \\label{vtens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where h.c . stands for `` hermitian conjugate '' . the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , along with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 determine the eight coupling constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the isoscalar and isovector parts of the functional ) .",
    "the definitions of the operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as the list and expressions of the coupling constants appearing in the functional can be found in the article of lesinski _ _ et al.__@xcite",
    "the method used to fit the parameters of a skyrme interaction or functional consists in constructing a merit function that measures the deviation between targeted and calculated quantities .",
    "these quantities are generally several properties of the infinite nuclear matter , masses and charge radii of a set of doubly magic nuclei and one splitting between two single particle states , this latter being added to optimize the spin - orbit strength .    for the serie of functionals built from the sly5 interaction , we have modified the coefficient @xmath20 given by @xmath21 with the parameters of sly5 the value of this coefficent is @xmath22 .",
    "the serie of functional used here is then obtained by varying this coefficient without modifying the other ones . changing a single coupling constant without refitting the entire functional deteriorates the properties of the functional itself ( _ i.e. _ the reproduction of some physical observables ) , but this is not crucial in the present work since this modification is only used to explore the relation between the appearance of instabilities and the value of one term of the functional .",
    "the set of t@xmath2 interactions are obtained by setting @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 integers from 1 to 6 and with @xmath27 all the parameters of the interactions being then adjusted in order to minimize a given merit function@xcite with an iterative procedure nearly identical to that used for the construction of the sly parameterizations.@xcite",
    "to adjust the parameters of an effective interaction , one starts from an initial set of parameters that can at least provide with a saturation point in symmetric infinite nuclear matter and this set of parameters is modified iteratively in order to minimize a merit function . during the iterations , some instabilities can be experienced .",
    "for example , one can observe domains in finite nuclei where the isovector density becomes large .",
    "this phenomenon can ultimately lead to a total separation between protons and neutrons and a disappearance of nuclei as bound states .",
    "the regions of the parameters space that lead to these unwanted situations should be avoided and it would be helpful to have a criterium that predicts where those regions are .    in a previous work,@xcite",
    "it was shown that the coefficient @xmath20 of the skyrme functional can be related with this kind of isospin instability .",
    "we illustrate this correspondance by the following schematic serie of calculations for @xmath28ca .",
    "we start from the effective interaction sly5 which is stable in the isospin channel and for which @xmath29 .",
    "we keep all the other coefficients of the functional constant and vary @xmath20 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 where an isospin instability appears in this nucleus ( the limit value can change from one nucleus to an other ) .",
    "we observe that the total energy of @xmath28ca calculated at the hf approximation decreases with @xmath20 ( from -415.9  mev to -417.2  mev ) and that this gain of energy is due to the appearance of strong oscillations of the isovector density @xmath32 as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] .",
    "for @xmath33 the nucleus @xmath28ca is disrupted in finite size domains of neutrons and protons .",
    "this kind of instabilities can be detected during the fit procedure but the situation is obviously more complicated for the instabilities in the spin channel since one has to break the time reversal symmetry to observe it .",
    "a possible constraint on the landau parameters ( as it was the case for the sly functionals ) would only avoid global polarizations of infinite nuclear matter,@xcite but not the finite size instabilities .",
    "unfortunately , these spin instabilities have been identified recently in mean - field calculations where the time reversal symmetry is broken ( cranked calculation@xcite and calculations of odd - even nuclei@xcite ) when the functional is explicitely derived from the effective interaction ( _ i.e. _ all time - even and time - odd terms are kept ) .",
    "calculations of systems where the time reversal symmetry is broken are two much time consuming to be easily incorporated in the fit procedure of the parameters , one needs an efficient tool to predict and avoid all possible finite size instabilities both in the spin and isospin channels .",
    "the basic formalism of linear response theory has been already explained in several articles , in our work we follow the formalism used in the article of garcia - recio _ _ et al.__@xcite in this work , we restrict our study to the response to an external probe of an infinite system initially unpolarized both in spin and isospin spaces ( symmetric nuclear matter , snm ) at zero temperature .",
    "the excitations of the system result from the residual particle - hole interaction between particles below and above the fermi level . in the theory of fermi liquids ,",
    "this interaction is given by the second functional derivative of the energy functional @xmath34 $ ] , with respect to the densities taken from the hartree - fock solution .",
    "its matrix elements read @xmath35}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{q } ,   \\mathbf{k}_1)\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{k}_2 , \\mathbf{k}_2+\\mathbf{q } ) } \\,,\\ ] ] where we denote by @xmath36 the spin and isospin in the particle - hole ( p - h ) channels with @xmath37 ( or 1 ) for the non spin - flip ( or spin - flip ) channel , @xmath38 ( or 1 ) for the isoscalar ( or isovector ) channel , and @xmath39 being the projection of the spin on the quantization axis .",
    "as usual , we have chosen as independent variables the initial ( final ) momentum @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) of the hole and the external momentum transfer @xmath42 .",
    "to calculate the response of the medium , it is convenient to introduce the green s function , or p - h propagator , at the energy @xmath43 : @xmath44 , which in the hartree - fock approximation , does not depend on the spin - isospin channel ( @xmath45 ) and reads@xcite @xmath46 considering now the residual interaction of equation  ( [ eq : matr : el ] ) , we can calculate the rpa correlated green s function by solving the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath47 for a detailed discussion on the solution of equation  ( [ bseq ] ) we refer to the work of davesne _ _ et al.__@xcite finally the response function @xmath48 of the infinite medium is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor ( @xmath51 for snm ) . within this formalism",
    ", an unstable mode is marked by the occurrence of a pole in @xmath52 at @xmath53 , corresponding to zero excitation energy .",
    "the occurrence of a pole at finite @xmath54 characterizes a system that is unstable within respect to the appearance of a spatial oscillation of a given type with a given wavelength @xmath55 .",
    "we search for the density @xmath56 in the @xmath57 plan that corresponds to a pole in equation  ( [ eq : chirpa ] ) at zero excitation energy .",
    "these densities are represented on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] for three modified sly5 functionals in the @xmath58 channels .",
    "@xmath59{iso.eps } \\,&\\ , \\includegraphics[angle=270,width=6.15cm]{sly5.eps } \\end{matrix}$ ]    one can see that there is a clear relation between the instabilities discussed in section  [ sec : inst ] and the critical densities represented on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] , in particular we observe that the poles of the response function in the scalar - isoscalar channel approach the saturation density @xmath60 for increasing values of @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig : tij ] we show the minimal value @xmath63 of the critical densities @xmath56 for any @xmath54 for all the t@xmath2 interactions in the channels with @xmath64 . to have a stable interaction , it is necessary that the functional satisfies the minimal condition @xmath65 in all channels . as a result",
    "we observe that none of the t@xmath2 interactions is stable , this is in agreement with recent cranked hfb calculations in finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "we have given and illustrated an example of the finite size spin and isospin instabilities that can occur in nuclei .",
    "we have also reported that finite size instabilities are known to appear in calculations that break the time reversal symmetries with several skyrme interactions .",
    "the terms of the functional that are responsible for the appearance of the instabilities can be indentified and omitted , but this rough method breaks the link between the functional and an underlying effective interaction .",
    "calculations beyond the mean - field approximation are then more involved since one has to remove spurious contributions from the energy . if one wants to keep the link that relates the interaction to the functional and avoid those spurious contributions in the energy , one needs a method that can predict there appearance and this method must be numerically fast enough to be usable during the fitting procedure of the parameters .",
    "the method of the linear reponse that we present here seems to be an efficient tool to reveal these finite size instabilities , although the exact correspondance between the instabilities in infinite nuclear matter and nuclei needs to be studied in more details .",
    "first of all , finite size and shell effects being non trivial in nuclei , one has to test whether there is a robust correspondance between instabilities in infinite nuclear matter and nuclei .",
    "if this is confirmed , one has to estimate how close the critical densities can be from the saturation density before an instability shows up .    the calculations of the linear response and critical densities being very fast , they will be incorporated in the fitting procedure of effective forces and functionals in the future .",
