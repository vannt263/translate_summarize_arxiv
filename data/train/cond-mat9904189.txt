    "ferrofluids  @xcite are oil- or water - based colloidal suspensions of permanently magnetized particles . in an applied magnetic field the particles align creating a strong paramagnetic response in the ferrofluid . because they are fluids , these suspensions can flow in response to forces .",
    "for example , ferrofluid droplets elongate parallel to applied fields  @xcite and undergo tip - sharpening transitions  @xcite . when a ferrofluid droplet is confined between two plates in a `` thin film '' geometry , surrounded by an immiscible fluid , and a field",
    "is applied perpendicular to the plates , it undergoes field induced bifurcations  @xcite leading to intricate labyrinthine patterns  @xcite .",
    "ferrofluid emulsions  @xcite undergo structural transitions under an applied field from a randomly dispersed structure of the emulsion droplets to droplet chains , columns and worm like structures  @xcite depending on volume fraction , sample geometry and the rate of field application .",
    "a droplet of ferrofluid elongates under applied field because of the demagnetizing fields of magnetic poles on the surface of the droplet .",
    "surface poles arise wherever the droplet magnetization has a component perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the demagnetizing field that they create opposes the magnetization , creating a demagnetizing energy that depends on the shape of the droplet .",
    "the droplet elongates to reduce its demagnetizing field and energy . because elongation increases the surface energy of the system ,",
    "an equilibrium shape is reached when the magnetic forces balance against the surface tension forces .",
    "the elongation of freely suspended , 3-dimensional droplets has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "the droplets can be assumed to be ellipsoids for small elongation .",
    "the demagnetizing field is thus uniform and the elongation ( major axis minus minor axis divided by minor axis ) is found to be proportional to the undeformed droplet radius .",
    "the case of droplets confined in `` thin film geometry '' however , involves two length scales , droplet thickness and its undeformed diameter . in the limit of small aspect ratio ( droplet thickness divided by its undeformed diameter ) the demagnetizing fields are stronger near the edges of the droplet than at its center .",
    "we find that the elongation divided by droplet thickness in this geometry is proportional to the logarithm of the aspect ratio .",
    "prior experiments  @xcite have proposed droplet elongation as a tool for measuring surface tension between the ferrofluid and the surrounding immiscible fluid .",
    "we improve on the existing theory  @xcite by incorporating spatial variation of the demagnetizing field inside the droplet .",
    "we perform an experiment supporting our predicted logarithmic behavior .",
    "section  [ theory ] of this paper presents our theoretical study of the elongation of a ferrofluid droplet confined within a thin film .",
    "our principal result is a predicted logarithmic dependence of elongation on droplet aspect ratio .",
    "we contrast this result with the corresponding elongation of unconfined droplets .",
    "section  [ expt ] describes an experiment done with ferrofluid emulsions that tests our theory .",
    "the experiment is in qualitative agreement with our theoretical prediction , but differs quantitatively in at least one respect . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss a possible explanation of the discrepancy based upon droplet contact angles with the confining plates .",
    "consider a paramagnetic liquid droplet confined in a thin film between two parallel plates with a gap , @xmath0 , in the @xmath1 direction ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "an immiscible liquid surrounds the droplet .",
    "let the thickness , @xmath0 , be much smaller than the radius of the undeformed droplet , @xmath2 .",
    "this small aspect ratio @xmath3 provides the pseudo - two - dimensional character of the problem . if a uniform , weak , field @xmath4 is applied parallel to the plate , the droplet magnetizes .",
    "the magnetization creates an opposing demagnetizing field whose strength depends on the droplet shape .",
    "the droplet elongates to decrease its magnetic energy , reaching equilibrium when the magnetic forces balance against the restoring forces due to surface tension . in this section",
    "we define the elongation of the droplet and calculate the surface energy , @xmath5 , and the magnetic energy , @xmath6 , of the droplet as a function of its elongation . by minimizing the total energy with respect to the elongation we obtain the elongation as a function of @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0",
    ".    for simplicity assume the elongated droplet has a uniform cross section , @xmath7 , independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to a contact angle of @xmath9 between the paramagnetic liquid , the surrounding fluid and the glass plates , and a plate spacing much less than the capillary length of the two liquids .",
    "thus the droplet has straight edges if viewed from the side ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the role of contact angle will be discussed later in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we write the equation for @xmath7 in polar coordinates as a generic smooth perturbation to a circle , @xmath10 we only include a single harmonic , since we expect coefficients for the higher harmonics to be much smaller than @xmath11 for small perturbations . the cross section @xmath7 has semi - major axis @xmath12 , and semi - minor axis @xmath13 ( see figure 1b ) , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we define the elongation of the droplet @xmath16 we assume that the elongation , @xmath17 , is much less than @xmath18 . imposing the constraint that the volume of the droplet ( @xmath0 times cross - sectional area ) remains constant we calculate @xmath19 where @xmath20 .    the surface energy is the sum of interfacial areas times surface tensions between all pairs of the three phases ( solid glass , ferrofluid droplet and immiscible fluid ) . for the case of uniform cross - section ( @xmath9 contact angle )",
    "droplets , the glass - ferrofluid and glass - immiscible fluid interfacial areas are independent of the shape of @xmath21 due to the fixed volume constraint . hence we concern ourselves with the droplet - surfactant solution interface , the area of which is @xmath0 times the perimeter . the perimeter of cross section @xmath7 can be calculated as a power series in @xmath17 , @xmath22 as expected ,",
    "the leading correction to @xmath23 is second order in @xmath17 since the perimeter should increase regardless of the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "the relevant surface energy of the droplet is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the surface tension of the ferrofluid - immiscible fluid interface .",
    "the total magnetic energy of any paramagnetic body under applied field is  @xcite @xmath26 the magnetization @xmath27 is determined by the self consistent equation @xmath28 for linear susceptibility @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the demagnetizing field due to the magnetization @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the outward normal at any point on the surface .",
    "the surface integral gives the demagnetizing field due to the surface poles which appear wherever the magnetization has a component normal to the surface .",
    "the volume integral gives the contribution to the demagnetizing field due to volume charges which appear at points where the magnetization has non - zero divergence .    to calculate the magnetic energy we expand @xmath33 and @xmath34 in power series in the susceptibility @xmath29 , @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "equating terms in  ( [ m ] ) of equal order in @xmath29 we get @xmath40 and @xmath41 note that @xmath42 is independent of @xmath43 because the applied field is uniform whereas @xmath37 may depend on @xmath44 for @xmath45 because @xmath46 may be non - uniform .",
    "to second order in @xmath29 we write the magnetic energy of the droplet in  ( [ magnetic - nrg ] ) as @xmath47    the first term in equation  ( [ mag - nrg2 ] ) for the magnetic energy is independent of the shape of the droplet and hence unimportant for our consideration .",
    "the second term in the energy is the demagnetizing energy @xmath48 due to a uniform magnetization @xmath49 . because @xmath50 is uniform there are no volume charges , and the surface poles appear only along the droplet - immiscible fluid interface , to first order in @xmath29 .",

    "the term in the brackets can be identified as @xmath70 times the demagnetizing factor  @xcite of the droplet along the direction of applied field .",
    "additional terms in the series in equation  ( [ expansion ] ) are of higher order in @xmath17 or in @xmath71 . for small elongation and large aspect ratio we may neglect these higher order terms .    minimizing the total energy @xmath72 with respect to @xmath17 gives @xmath73 corrections to this result are higher order in aspect ratio @xmath71 or higher order in @xmath17 itself .",
    "interestingly , the elongation depends only logarithmically on the undeformed radius @xmath2 , and has a much stronger dependence on the thickness , @xmath0 , of the droplet .",
    "this result differs from an earlier theory  @xcite which omits the logarithm because it assumes that the demagnetizing field is uniform inside the droplet .    in the case of unconfined , nearly ellipsoidal droplets  @xcite ,",
    "the demagnetizing field is quite uniform inside the droplet .",
    "the demagnetizing energy is therefore proportional to the volume ( @xmath74 ) of the droplet according to equation  ( [ mag - nrg2 ] ) .",
    "the surface energy is proportional to the area ( @xmath75 ) and the elongation is thus proportional to @xmath2 . in the case of thin film geometry , however , the demagnetizing field is very non - uniform . for distances",
    "much less than @xmath0 near the droplet edge , the component of the demagnetizing field is of order @xmath76 , since the edge acts like an infinite sheet of charge in the first approximation . for distances much greater than @xmath0",
    "the demagnetizing field is of order @xmath77 since the edge acts as a line charge in this case .",
    "the contribution to the integral for the demagnetizing energy in equation  ( [ mag - nrg2 ] ) mainly comes from the bulk of the droplet and goes like @xmath78 .",
    "the surface energy is proportional to @xmath79 and the elongation is therefore proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "the logarithmic variation of elongation with the aspect ratio is thus a signature of the non - uniform nature of the demagnetizing field inside the droplet .",

    "a solution of a commercial detergent made the best emulsions while solutions with other pure anionic surfactants either showed hardly any elongation of the ferrofluid droplets under applied field or produced droplets without sharp boundaries with the aqueous phase . in contrast , our stable , well behaved emulsions allowed us to probe and confirm the fundamental aspects of our model .    to prepare the emulsions , a single drop of ferrofluid ( @xmath81 ml )",
    "was added to @xmath82 ml of surfactant solution which was a @xmath83 times dilution of the commercial detergent .",

    "there is substantial scatter in the data , but the deviations from a straight line are random and consistent with the error bars .",
    "the chief source of uncertainty was the @xmath88 uncertainty in thickness due to the variation observed across the sample .",

    "it may be possible to explain this discrepancy by considering the effect of the contact angle of the ferrofluid - immiscible fluid interface with the glass plates . in the discussion section below",
    "we explore the qualitative effect of the contact angle .    in figure 6(a ) we plot @xmath111 versus @xmath112 on a linear scale .",
    "if the demagnetizing field inside the droplet was uniform like in the case of unconfined droplets , the plot would be a straight line .",
    "however , the plot is clearly not a straight line and the deviations from the best fitted straight line are systematic ( see figure 6(b ) ) .",
    "this further supports our theoretical result that the demagnetizing field inside a confined droplet is non - uniform and the elongation divided by thickness is proportional to the logarithm of the aspect ratio .",
    "the results discussed in section  [ expt ] agree with our theoretical prediction  ( [ elongation ] ) of logarithmic variation of @xmath113 with a proportionality constant of @xmath114 . however , our theoretical value for @xmath115 is @xmath116 whereas the experimentally measured value for @xmath115 is @xmath117 .",
    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy in the value of @xmath115 is that the ferrofluid / glass contact angle is not @xmath9 and consequently the cross - section of the droplet is not uniform .",
    "our calculations are for uniform droplet cross - section , which corresponds to a contact angle @xmath118 between the glass plate and liquid droplet .",
    "the experiment , however , was performed with an oil - based ferrofluid in a surfactant solution for which the oil - glass contact angle @xmath119 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "a contact angle of other than @xmath9 will affect the elongation in two ways : by changing interfacial areas to alter the functional form of @xmath5 and by redistributing the magnetic surface poles to alter the functional form of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider these two effects in turn .",
    "first , however , we must address an ambiguity in the definition of aspect ratio and elongation which results from the non - uniformity of droplet cross - section .",
    "our experiment observes the profile of the largest cross - section of the droplet . for a circular droplet with @xmath120",
    "this is the radius @xmath121 defined as the radius at mid - gap as shown in figure 7 . for an elongated droplet we measure the semi - major and -minor axes @xmath122 and @xmath123 and , through equation  ( [ definition ] ) , the elongation @xmath124 .",
    "we also define @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 associated with the ferrofluid - immiscible fluid - glass plate contact line ( see figure 7 ) . since @xmath0 is much less than the capillary length of the ferrofluid / immiscible fluid , to a good approximation  @xcite the profile of the droplet will be an arc of a circle , so the difference between @xmath121 and @xmath125 is of order @xmath0 , and likewise for the semi - major and -minor axes .",
    "the difference @xmath129 is of order @xmath130 relative to the elongation .",
    "recall that our result  ( [ elongation ] ) for the elongation is only the lowest order term in a series expansion in the aspect ratio .",
    "thus the distinction between @xmath121 and @xmath125 , and between @xmath124 and @xmath128 , does not alter our result at the lowest order in aspect ratio .",
    "when the contact angle differs from @xmath9 , the cross section of the droplet depends on @xmath8 . consequently , the contact areas of the glass plates with the droplet and with the surfactant solution may vary as the droplet elongates .",
    "all the three interfacial areas must be taken into account to calculate the surface energy .",
    "the total surface energy is @xmath131 where the three surface tensions between ferrofluid - immiscible fluid , ferrofluid - glass , and surfactant solution - glass , are denoted by @xmath132 , and @xmath133 respectively , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are defined below and the total area of the sample is denoted by @xmath136 .",
    "the factors of @xmath85 in the second and third terms of the surface energy account for the two glass surfaces .",
    "the area of the droplet - surfactant solution interface @xmath137 is given approximately by the circumference of @xmath7 multiplied by the arc length of the bulge @xmath138 we use @xmath121 here to calculate the circumference of the droplet because is the radius observed during the experiment .",
    "to first order in the aspect ratio , using @xmath121 or @xmath125 in equation  ( [ ac ] ) yields the same result .",
    "the droplet s contact area with the glass plates must be adjusted to maintain a constant total volume of ferrofluid as the droplet elongates .",
    "we approximate the volume of the bulging region by the circumference of @xmath7 multiplied by the projected area of the bulge .",
    "the contact area @xmath135 must be adjusted so that @xmath139 changes by the negative of the change in volume of the bulge .",
    "thus we write @xmath140}.\\ ] ] using @xmath125 instead of @xmath121 makes the above result exact for zero elongation .",
    "the area of ferrofluid in contact with the glass plates decreases with elongation for an acute contact angle because the volume of the fluid contained in the outward bulge of the droplet increases and therefore the fluid contained in the bulk of the droplet decreases . for obtuse contact angles",
    "exactly the opposite happens for similar reasons .    to understand how the contact angle affects the magnetic energy ,",
    "consider the work done by the magnetic field as we change the contact angle from @xmath9 to @xmath141 while keeping the volume of the droplet constant .",
    "this work , divided by the circumference , must be independent of @xmath121 in the limit @xmath121 going to infinity , since the magnetic field near the surface of the droplet will not depend on @xmath121 in the large @xmath121 limit .",
    "the work done by the magnetic field is the difference in energy between the straight edge droplet with contact angle of @xmath9 and the bulging droplet with a contact angle of @xmath141 .",
    "the demagnetizing energy of the bulging droplet must therefore have the same dependence on @xmath142 as the straight edge droplet or the difference in the demagnetizing energies divided by the circumference will be proportional to @xmath143 and will blow up in the large @xmath121 limit .",
    "hence , the demagnetizing energy for the bulging droplet must be identical to equation  ( [ expansion ] ) but with different values @xmath144 and @xmath145 replacing the constants @xmath146 and @xmath115 .    as the droplet bulges inward or outward the charges on the surface get distributed over a larger area , decreasing the demagnetizing energy .",
    "the constant @xmath144 therefore has a smaller value for a bulging ( inward or outward ) droplet than @xmath146 , the value for a straight - edged droplet .",
    "however , since the demagnetizing energy is always positive , smaller demagnetizing energy ( @xmath147 ) implies a weaker dependence of demagnetizing energy on elongation .",
    "thus , we expect the value of @xmath145 to be smaller for a bulging droplet than the value @xmath115 for a straight - edged droplet .",
    "finally , consider how the contact angle dependence of surface and magnetic energies affect the elongation calculated in equation  ( [ elongation ] ) for the case @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of the surface energy remains quadratic , but the coefficient now depends upon a linear combination of the three surface tensions @xmath25 , @xmath149 and @xmath133 .",
    "this combination will replace @xmath25 in equation  ( [ elongation ] ) .",
    "the functional form of the magnetic energy remains unchanged , but the values of @xmath146 and @xmath115 depend on contact angle",
    ". thus the smaller value @xmath145 replaces @xmath115 in equation  ( [ elongation ] ) . for @xmath150",
    "the experiment can not be used to determine @xmath151 unless @xmath149 and @xmath133 are known . since the @xmath141 in general is not @xmath9 , it is only possible to measure the effective surface tension during elongation , and",
    "not @xmath25 itself .",
    "we study the elongation ferrofluid droplets , confined in thin film geometry , under weak applied field .",
    "our theoretical calculations predict the elongation of a droplet depends logarithmically on aspect ratio .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the case of unconfined 3-dimensional droplets where elongation is directly proportional to undeformed droplet radius .",
    "we measured the elongation of ferrofluid droplets in an experiment performed on ferrofluid droplets in a ferrofluid / water / surfactant emulsion .",
    "the results of our experiment agree with the functional form our theoretical prediction , however the experimentally measured value of @xmath115 differs from the predicted value.we suggest the droplet contact angle with the confining plates as a source of this discrepancy ."
