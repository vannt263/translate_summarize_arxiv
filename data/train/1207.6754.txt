    "ricci curvature lower bounds in general metric measure spaces were studied by the second author in @xcite and at the same time with a similar approach by lott and villani in @xcite . there",
    "the lower bound @xmath1 on the ricci curvature without a reference to the dimension of the metric measure space was defined as @xmath0-convexity of the entropy functional along wasserstein geodesics ( see section [ sec : preli ] for details ) .",
    "these spaces are called ( weak ) @xmath2-spaces .",
    "the word _ weak _ is sometimes used to emphasize that the convexity is required only along one geodesic between any two given probability measures .    a property of the @xmath2-spaces which complicates the theory is the possibility to have branching geodesics .",
    "for example the space @xmath3 with the @xmath4-norm is a @xmath5-space and it has lots of branching geodesics .",
    "being the limit as @xmath6 ( in any reasonable sense ) of the spaces @xmath3 with the @xmath7-norm  which are non - branching cd@xmath8-spaces  this example in particular illustrates that being non - branching is not a stable property .",
    "a number of results in @xmath2-spaces have been proven only under the extra assumption that there are no branching geodesics in the space .",
    "although in some of the results this assumption has recently been removed ( see for example @xcite ) , in many it still remains .",
    "because branching geodesics are hard to deal with , it is reasonable to consider more restrictive definitions that exclude spaces with branching geodesics or at least limit the amount of branching that can occur .",
    "one of the essential properties of the definitions of ricci curvature lower bounds in metric measure spaces is the stability under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence . therefore any stable definition that extends",
    "the riemannian case should include the limit spaces of riemannian manifolds with uniform ricci curvature lower bounds .",
    "while riemannian manifolds are known to be non - branching , to our knowledge it is not known whether this holds for their limit spaces .",
    "the spaces we consider in this paper cover also these limit spaces .",
    "although our result does not rule out the possibility to have some branching geodesics , it still says that there has to be so few branching geodesics that optimal transports between any two absolutely continuous measures do not see them .    before stating our main result we fix some terminology . in this paper",
    "we will always assume @xmath9 to be a complete separable geodesic metric space and @xmath10 to be a locally finite borel measure .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : preli ] for some details on optimal mass transportation and @xmath2 condition in such spaces .",
    "we call a space @xmath11 _ essentially non - branching _ if for every @xmath12 which are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath10 we have that any @xmath13 is concentrated on a set of non - branching geodesics .",
    "the space @xmath14 is said to be a strong @xmath2-space if the entropy @xmath15 is @xmath0-convex along every @xmath13 for every @xmath12 .",
    "[ thm : main ] every strong @xmath2-space is essentially non - branching .",
    "one of the cases which is covered by theorem [ thm : main ] are the @xmath16-spaces , that is , spaces with riemannian ricci curvature bounded from below by some constant @xmath1 .",
    "these spaces were recently defined and studied in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "they were obtained by reinforcing the @xmath2-spaces with a requirement that the local structure of the space must be hilbertian .",
    "the hilbertian structure immediately rules out spaces like the above mentioned @xmath3 with the @xmath4-norm . in @xcite it was shown that one of the equivalent formulations of @xmath16-spaces is that any probability measure with finite second moment is the starting point of an @xmath17-gradient flow of the entropy .",
    "this condition is known to imply @xmath0-convexity of the entropy along every geodesic @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was also proven that the definition of @xmath16 with a finite reference measure is stable under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence ( or under the @xmath18-convergence introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "later in @xcite the stability was proven with more general reference measures .",
    "when we combine the stability with theorem [ thm : main ] we arrive at the following corollary which in fact was our main motivation to write this paper .",
    "[ cor : rcd ] the @xmath16 condition is stable under measured gromov - hausdorff convergence ( or under the @xmath18-convergence ) and it implies essential non - branching .    as we already mentioned , we are not aware of any other non - branching results even for the gromov - hausdorff limits of riemannian manifolds with ricci curvature bounded from below by some constant .",
    "another corollary of our result is that the @xmath16 condition implies the formulation of @xmath2 that was used by lott and villani @xcite .",
    "they required convexity type inequalities for a class of functionals instead of just @xmath15 , and hence their definition was at least a priori more restrictive than the definition of @xmath2 we use here , following @xcite .",
    "corollary [ cor : lvcd ] is proven exactly as in the non - branching @xmath2-spaces . for the proof ,",
    "see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 30.32 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) .",

    "* theorem 3.3 ) where the existence of optimal maps in non - branching @xmath2-spaces was shown we can make a refinement of the statement of theorem [ thm : main ] . regarding this refinement , stated in corollary [ cor : maps ]",
    ", we note that in @xcite there was an extra assumption for the measures @xmath19 and @xmath20 to have finite entropy .",
    "this assumption was needed for showing that all absolutely continuous measures with respect to a measure @xmath13 satisfying also satisfy .",
    "here this conclusion is already as an assumption so finiteness of the initial and final entropies are not needed .",
    "[ cor : maps ] let @xmath14 be a strong @xmath2-space .",
    "then for every @xmath12 that are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath10 there is a unique @xmath13 and it is induced by a map .",
    "although corollary [ cor : maps ] follows quite easily from the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) together with theorem [ thm : main ] we will give at the end of the paper an outline of the proof together with some details that are different from the proof by gigli .",
    "in the classical situation of euclidean spaces the existence of optimal transport maps was proven by brenier in @xcite . since then",
    "there have been several generalizations of this result .",
    "most relevant in the context of this paper are the generalizations of mccann @xcite for riemannian manifolds , of bertrand @xcite for alexandrov spaces , and the most recent results of gigli @xcite in non - branching @xmath21 and @xmath2-spaces and of ambrosio and the first author @xcite in strongly non - branching metric spaces .",
    "notice that as in the approach by gigli @xcite our proof for the existence of optimal transport maps does not use kantorovich potentials .",
    "let us first recall some definitions and results related to optimal mass transportation and ricci curvature lower bounds using optimal mass transportation .",
    "more details on this subject can be found for example in the book by villani @xcite .    in this paper",
