    "the appearance of three generations of leptons and quarks and the related issue of their masses started to baffle us three quarters of a century ago . over the years",
    "the problem has become further complicated by the presence of inter - generation mixing , as revealed in weak interactions .",
    "fortunately , various approximate regularities have been found in the observed pattern of particle masses and mixings . among the many possible parametrizations of these regularities",
    ", there might be some whose simplicity could help us in deciphering physics beyond the standard model .",
    "+ one of the most interesting of such regularities is an empirical relation between the charged - lepton masses discovered by koide @xcite ( for a brief review see @xcite ) : @xmath8 with @xmath9 equal exactly @xmath10 . when the experimental @xmath11 and @xmath12 masses ( here taken from @xcite ) are inserted into eq .",
    "( [ koideformula ] ) , this relation predicts the tauon mass within one standard deviation from its observed value : @xmath13 discussions of this success of koide s formula ( [ koideformula ] ) are naturally formulated in a @xmath2-symmetric framework by parametrizing the masses of any three given fermions @xmath14 in terms of three parameters @xmath15 as @xcite : @xmath16 this choice of parametrization of masses is particularly suited to koide s formula as not only @xmath17 but also @xmath3 drop out of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ koideformula ] ) . +",
    "since @xmath3 is free we may assume @xmath18 without any loss of generality . from eq .",
    "( [ koideparametrization ] ) one then gets a counterpart of eq . ( [ koideformula ] ) ,",
    "in which it is now @xmath9 that drops out of the formula : @xmath19 from the experimental values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath20 masses one finds : @xmath21 which , as observed by brannen and rosen @xcite , is extremely close to @xmath22 conversely , assuming @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ tandeltal ] ) predicts the value of the tauon mass in terms of experimental @xmath11 and @xmath12 masses . just as in the case of koide s formula ,",
    "the relevant prediction is within one standard deviation from the measured @xmath20 mass : @xmath24 assuming that the koide and the brannen - rosen observations do not reflect mere coincidences , the @xmath2-symmetric parametrization ( [ koideparametrization ] ) should be rightly called ` doubly special ' .",
    "a peculiar feature of this parametrization is that the simple numbers of @xmath10 and @xmath25 work well at the _ low_-energy scale and not at some high mass scale .",
    "for example , taking the values of charged - lepton masses at the mass scale of @xmath26 , the extracted values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 deviate from their ` perfect ' values of @xmath10 and @xmath25 by about @xmath28 % and @xmath29 % respectively .",
    "apparently , an explanation of the success of predictions ( [ taukoideprediction ] , [ taurosenprediction ] ) should not be sought at the high - mass scale of some grand unified theory ( see eg .",
    "if there is some physical reason behind the appearance of simple numbers such as @xmath10 and @xmath25 in the charged - lepton sector , one would expect its analogs working in the quark and neutrino sectors as well .",
    "however , it is known that the original koide formula ( [ koideformula ] ) does not work when replacing the charged - lepton masses with those of neutrinos or quarks . for neutrinos one estimates directly from experiment that @xmath30 @xcite ( the mathematically allowed region being @xmath31 ) . for quarks",
    ", using their mass values appropriate at @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for the down ( up ) quarks respectively @xcite .",
    "if a higher energy scale @xmath35 is taken , even larger values are obtained , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "going from @xmath38 towards the low energy scale leads to smaller values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , the top quark mass is so large that one certainly can not bring @xmath40 into the vicinity of @xmath10 .",
    "+ on the other hand , it has been observed recently @xcite from the quark sector analogs of eq .",
    "( [ tandeltal ] ) that at the _ low_-energy",
    "scale the relevant phase parameters acquire approximate values : @xmath41 due to the problem of quark confinement we obviously can not check how precise the above equalities are .",
    "however , given the accuracy of their lepton counterpart ( eq .",
    "( [ taurosenprediction ] ) ) we may expect that they are nearly exact .",
    "therefore , we will assume this from now on and _ conjecture _ that at the low energy scale the charged - lepton and quark mass bases are characterised by eqs .",
    "( [ deltal29 ] , [ deltaud ] ) .",
    "the problem then remains how to interpret the value of @xmath6 and how it should be generalized to the quark sector .",
    "here we accept the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath42 is a feature of the weak basis .",
    "thus , according to @xcite , the masses of charged leptons are described by @xmath6 because for charged leptons the mass and the weak bases coincide .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix ( for simplicity we assume here dirac neutrino masses ) , i.e. @xmath43 is then wholly assigned to the contribution from neutrinos ( for which @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 in other words , if @xmath46 were different from @xmath10 , one would not expect the simplicity of koide s formula to persist .",
    "+ since the analogs of the charged - lepton equality @xmath6 do not hold in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 quark sectors , one expects that the quark counterpart of the decomposition ( [ leptondecomposition ] ) will be also modified .",
    "thus , in the ckm matrix @xmath49 both of the factor matrices @xmath50 and @xmath51 are expected to be different from @xmath10 .    for fermion type @xmath52",
    "the general connection between the mass and the weak bases is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass matrix in the weak basis . in the above formula @xmath55 , while @xmath56 may be chosen equal to @xmath10 . as a result , in the weak basis one",
    "deals with ` pseudo - masses ' @xmath57 defined as @xcite @xmath58 for charged leptons ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) these pseudo - masses coincide with the observed masses , i.e. @xmath61 . on the other hand , for quarks ( @xmath62 with @xmath63 ) the pseudo - masses are different from the observed mass values .",
    "it is for these ` pseudo - masses ' that , according to the proposal of @xcite , the analogs of koide s formula ( [ koideformula ] ) are supposed to hold with @xmath64 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used quark masses at the @xmath65 mass scale and found that it is possible to get @xmath66 provided one takes a value of the strange quark mass @xmath67 that is larger by a factor of 2.5 ( ! ) from the theoretical estimate at that scale . since the koide and the brannen - rosen observations work best at the _ low_-energy scale ( and not at the @xmath65 mass ) , and since at the low - energy scale the masses of quarks ( and especially @xmath68 , see @xcite ) are naturally expected to be larger than at the @xmath65 mass , a question appears if it is possible to recover koide s formula for quarks using low - energy quark masses corresponding to phases of formulas ( [ deltaud ] ) .",
    "this is the question asked here .",
    "thus , the present paper constitutes a low - energy - scale study of the idea of ref.@xcite .",
    "as the assumption of koide s formula for pseudo - masses imposes constraints upon matrices @xmath70 and @xmath50 ( and , consequently , upon @xmath71 ) , we have to discuss these matrices in some detail .    in @xcite fritzsch and",
    "xing convincingly argued that the hierarchical structure of quark mass terms suggests certain particular parametrizations of @xmath51 and @xmath50 as ` most physical ' ( i.e. that it selects one of the nine possible parametrizations of the @xmath71 matrix @xcite as probably the most suitable for the description of the quark - mixing phenomenon ) .",
    "the same parametrization was also advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite where the conjecture that koide s formula holds in the weak basis was originally formulated .",
    "consequently , we think that it is justified to accept the fritzsch - xing parametrization here .",
    "the relevant ` natural ' parametrizations of @xmath51 and @xmath50 are then : @xmath72 with ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) @xmath75 thus , the induced parametrization of the @xmath71 matrix can be read from : @xmath76 the product @xmath77 may be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ r23form ] ) with a single phase @xmath78 and a single rotation angle @xmath79 , ( with @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) @xmath82 the ckm matrix is then parametrized as @xmath83 since quark fields can be freely rephased , all of the three angles @xmath84 can be arranged to lie in the first quadrant so that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are all positive ( the phase @xmath87 can not be so restricted ) .",
    "we use the following absolute values of the elements of the ckm matrix most relevant for our parametrization @xcite : @xmath88 inserting the above numbers , we find from ( [ ckmparametrization ] ) : @xmath89 since formula ( [ pseudomasses ] ) involves absolute values , the actual sizes of @xmath90 and @xmath91 and , consequently , the experimentally imposed restriction on the cp - violating phase parameter @xmath78 are irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , together with the low - energy ratios @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( see e.g. @xcite ) suffice to fix the pattern of low - energy quark masses up to two overall mass scales ( in the up and down sectors ) .",
    "these scales are irrelevant for the discussion of koide s formulas for pseudo - masses . for illustrative purposes , however , one may set @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this choice leads to the following representative values of _",
    "low_-energy quark masses ( in @xmath98 ) : @xmath99        for a given value of @xmath5 , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 dropping from expression ( [ pseudomasses ] ) for the pseudo - masses , the condition @xmath100 imposes two constraints : between @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the down quark sector , and between @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the up quark sector .",
    "thus , @xmath102 becomes dependent on @xmath101 ( and @xmath104 on @xmath103 ) . for @xmath64",
    "there are two possible solutions for function @xmath105 and two possible solutions for function @xmath106 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with solid lines marked as @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) . however , only the combination @xmath110 is positive .",
    "specifically , taking the central experimental values of @xmath103 and @xmath101 , one finds @xmath111 which is only slightly different from the value given in eq .",
    "( [ anglesexp ] ) .",
    "a question thus emerges how big a departure of @xmath112 from 1 is needed to fit the current experimental value of @xmath113 .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] correspond to @xmath114 and @xmath115 as obtained for @xmath116 .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath113 is then @xmath117 , which is in good agreement with experiment . for completeness",
    ", we also show the contour plot of @xmath113 as a function of @xmath101 and @xmath103 for @xmath64 ( fig . [",
    "fig2]a ) and @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "dashed lines correspond to contours @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 ) .",
    "although it might seem that the above results indicate that one can not obtain @xmath120 , this is not the case .",
    "one has to remember that while parametrizations ( [ uduuparametrizations ] ) have been suggested as the most appropriate ones @xcite , they may be ` naturally ' modified .",
    "indeed , the same @xmath71 is obtained if one substitutes @xmath121 and @xmath122 , provided @xmath123 and @xmath124 denote the same arbitrary unitary matrix .",
    "if @xmath125 , but both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are very close to @xmath10 , a minor modification of our results is expected .",
    "such a natural modification of @xmath126 is obtained if we put @xmath127 with very small @xmath128 . since the inclusion of two new parameters @xmath129 introduces additional freedom into the scheme",
    ", it does not make sense to study it here .",
    "however - keeping this freedom in mind - the parametrization of eq.([uduuparametrizations ] ) and our numerical results may be viewed as capturing the dominant effects only .    in conclusion ,",
    "the data are consistent with the statement that low - energy quark masses satisfy phase relations @xmath130 , while the expected koide relations @xmath131 hold approximately for masses transformed to the weak basis , as suggested in @xcite",
