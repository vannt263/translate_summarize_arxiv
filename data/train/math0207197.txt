    "it is initially surprising that perfect codes of the same length can have different numbers of codewords , but this is explained by the fact that the balls @xmath96 have different sizes .    in view of this and the result in ( [ eqvt5 ] ) , it is tempting to make the following conjecture .",
    "[ th4 ] the codes @xmath106 are optimal for all @xmath28 .",
    "this is true for @xmath119 , as already mentioned , but for larger @xmath28 it is possible that other , smaller , perfect codes may exist , or even that smaller , optimal but non - perfect codes may exist .",

    "can be replaced by 111000 and 000111 .",
    "the former pair cover eight vectors of length 5 , but the latter only cover four vectors of length 5 , leaving four vectors uncovered .",
    "this suggests the possibility that in some larger code @xmath106 it may be possible to replace @xmath87 vectors by @xmath125 vectors , which would prove that these codes are not optimal .    in view of these remarks , conjecture [ th4 ] does not seem especially compelling !",
    "as can be seen from ( [ eqvt1a ] ) , the codes @xmath106 are linear for @xmath126 .",
    "they are never again linear , since , for @xmath127 , @xmath106 contains the vectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 but not their sum .    in particular , even though @xmath130 , this code is not linear .",
    "one might wonder if it is possible to find a linear code that will do as well , but a computer search has shown that no such code exists .    on the other hand , by adapting a construction of tenengolts @xcite , one can modify the varshamov - tenengolts construction to obtain linear codes , with only a small increase in the length of the code .",
    "[ de22 ] given @xmath131 , let @xmath132 the linear single - deletion - correcting code @xmath133 has dimension @xmath87 and consists of all vectors @xmath134 , where @xmath135 are information symbols and the @xmath136 check symbols @xmath137 are chosen so that @xmath138 @xmath139 .",

    "the number of check symbols in these codes is of the order of @xmath143 , compared with @xmath144 for the @xmath106 codes .",

    "as mentioned in section [ secti ] , the entry for sequence in @xcite indicates that these numbers also arise in the enumeration of shift register sequences @xcite .",
    "we will show here that indeed this is the same sequence .",
    "but whether this is anything more than a coincidence remains an open question .",
    "of course there are well - known connections between shift - register sequences and conventional error - correcting codes ( cf .",
    "@xcite , chapter 7 ) , so there should be a deeper explanation .    the context in which sequence a16 appears in golomb s book @xcite is the enumeration of the ( infinite ) output sequences from certain types of @xmath28-stage binary shift registers .",
    "we consider four kinds of shift registers : the _ pure cycling register _ ( or pcr ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , the _ complemented cycling register _",
    "( or ccr ) , the _ pure summing register _ ( or psr ) and the _ complemented summing register _ ( or csr ) .",
    "if the shift register has @xmath28 cells , initially containing @xmath145 @xmath146 or 1 ) , then @xmath147 is appended to the output stream , symbols @xmath148 move to the left , and the symbol @xmath149 is fed back to the right - most cell .",
    "difg1.pstex_t    the problem is to determine the numbers of different possible output sequences from these registers , which we denote by @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "for example @xmath154 , corresponding to the sequences @xmath155 all having period 6 ( or a divisor of 6 ) .",

    ".number of ouput sequences from @xmath28-stage shift registers of types pcr , ccr , psr , csr .",

    "actually ( [ eqg3 ] ) is due to michael somos ( personal communication ) , golomb s version ( given in ( [ eqg4 ] ) below ) being slightly more complicated .",
    "the numbers @xmath150 ( sequence ) in the first column are also familiar as the number of binary irreducible polynomials of degree dividing @xmath28 , and the number of @xmath28-bead necklaces formed with beads of two colors , when the necklaces may not be turned over ( cf .",

    "fredricksen @xcite shows that @xmath157 is the number of 1 s in the truth table defining the lexicographically least de  bruijn cycle .",
    "note that sequence appears in two places in the table , for ccr registers of length @xmath28 and csr registers of length @xmath158 .",
    "we begin by explaining this , and thus proving that @xmath159 suppose for concreteness that @xmath160 . the output sequences from the four types of register are ( omitting plus signs , and writing @xmath161 rather than @xmath162 , etc . ) : @xmath163 in general these sequences have periods @xmath28 , @xmath164 , @xmath58 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "if we replace ( ii ) by the sums of adjacent pairs we get @xmath165 a csr(3 ) sequence .",
    "conversely , given a csr(3 ) sequence , say @xmath166 of period 4 , there is a unique ccr(4 ) sequence of period 8 corresponding to it , namely @xmath167 applying this argument in the general case establishes ( [ eqg3a ] ) .    in the rest of the proof we make use of burnside s lemma ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which states that the number of orbits of a finite permutation group @xmath168 is equal to the average number of points that are fixed by the elements of @xmath168 .",
    "let us first prove ( [ eqg1 ] ) .",
    "( this is golomb s proof @xcite . )",
    "we take @xmath168 to be the cyclic group of order @xmath28 generated by @xmath169 , acting on @xmath98 .",
    "the permutation @xmath170 @xmath171 contains @xmath172 cycles , each of length @xmath173 , and has order @xmath173 .",
    "there are precisely @xmath174 vectors fixed by @xmath170 , since each cycle must consist of all 0 s or all 1 s .",
    "hence , by burnside s lemma , @xmath175    to establish ( [ eqg2 ] ) , we note from ( iv ) that @xmath176 is equal to the number of orbits of the same group , but now acting on binary vectors of length @xmath28 and odd weight .",
    "the number of odd weight vectors fixed by @xmath170 is @xmath177 if the cycle lengths @xmath173 are odd , and zero otherwise .",
    "hence @xmath178    finally , we prove ( [ eqg3 ] ) , by determining @xmath179 .",
    "the group is the same , but now ( see ( iii ) ) acting on even weight vectors",
    ". if @xmath180 is even there are @xmath181 fixed vectors , but if @xmath30 is odd only @xmath182 fixed vectors .",
    "hence @xmath183 since @xmath184 if @xmath30 odd , @xmath185 if @xmath30 even .",
    "but a mystery still remains : is the fact that the number of codewords in @xmath106 equals @xmath150 just a numerical coincidence , or is there a one - to - one correspondence between the codewords and the ccr shift register sequences ?",
    "( this is essentially equivalent to a research problem stated by stanley in @xcite , chapter 1 , problem 27(c ) . )",
    "furthermore , why is @xmath90 ( sequence in @xcite ) , equal to the number of @xmath186-bead necklaces with beads of two colors and primitive period @xmath58 , when the two colors may be interchanged but the necklaces may not be turned over ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) ?",
    "this is also the number of irreducible polynomials over @xmath187 of degree @xmath58 in which the coefficient of @xmath188 is 1 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the entry for in @xcite also indicates that this sequence arose in brouwer s enumeration @xcite of locally transitive tournaments .",
    "a tournament is a directed graph with one directed edge between any two nodes .",
    "it is transitive if there are no directed cycles .",
    "a locally transitive tournament is a tournament such that the subgraphs on the predecessors of a point and the successors of a point are both transitive .",
    "brouwer , answering a question raised by p. j. cameron , determined the number of locally transitive tournaments on @xmath28 nodes .",
    "he began by calculating the first few values by computer .",
    "then he looked up this sequence in @xcite , and found the reference to golomb s book @xcite . with this hint alone , and without having access to the book , he established a one - to - one correspondence between these tournaments and output sequences from shift registers of ccr type . from this he obtained the formula @xmath189 where odd(i ) is 0 or 1 according to whether @xmath190 is even or odd , and @xmath191 is the mbius function ( ) . using the identity @xmath192 ( @xcite , p.  26 ) , ( [ eqg5 ] ) immediately reduces to ( [ eqg2 ] ) .",
