    "entanglement , the non classical correlation between separated quantum systems , represents the physical resource lying at the very basis of quantum information ( qi ) , quantum computation and quantum communication . the current proliferation of relevant applications of quantum entanglement , ranging from the one - way quantum computation @xcite to the emerging fields of quantum metrology , lithography , etc .",
    "@xcite strengthens the need of new flexible and reliable techniques to generate entangled states with increasing dimension .",
    "entangled photonic qubit pairs generated under suitable phase - matching conditions by the spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) process in a nonlinear ( nl ) crystal have been central to many applications ranging from teleportation @xcite to various quantum key distribution protocols @xcite . today the realization of reliable spdc sources with large efficiency , i.e. with large  brilliance ",
    ", able to generate entangled pure states is of key interest as they largely determine the range of applications of the sophisticated optical methods required by modern qi .",
    "recently , high brilliance sources have been realized by using bulk @xcite and periodically poled @xcite nl crystals , and fiber coupled spdc radiation @xcite .",
    "the extension of the attained results to higher dimensional qi qubit carriers could lead to new information processing tasks @xcite and requires the development of appropriate technological and theoretical tools .",
    "significant results in this field are the spdc  generation of  four - photon entangled states with or without ",
    "_ quantum - injection _  @xcite . at the same time , the sophisticated level attained by qi processing of photonic qubits has directed a consistent part of the experimental endeavour towards the solution of more technical problems .",
    "for instance , since the losses due to the photon transmission represent a restriction to the realization of several qi protocols , classes of entangled states robust against losses have been investigated and a few experimental schemes to generate such states have been proposed @xcite . in the case of three qubits",
    ", entangled states can be classified as  ghz - type  or as  w - type  , the latter exhibiting a larger robustness in bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "the w - states can be generalized to an arbitrary number of qubits and can be generated efficiently by spontaneous or stimulated emission in a high gain @xmath1 regime , i.e. when the parametric  gain ",
    "is large : @xmath2 .",
    "the first experimental realization of 3 photons w - states by spontaneous emission have been recently reported @xcite .    in  this framework",
    "the investigation of the multiphoton state generated in @xmath3 condition is of fundamental importance , both on a conceptual and practical sides , e.g. for non - locality test @xcite or for qi applications .",
    "recently multiphoton entangled states created by @xmath4 spdc have been observed @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate relevant aspects of the output wavefunction of the @xmath4 scheme . in section",
    "ii , the density matrix representing the 2-photon reduced state arising from @xmath4 spdc after propagation over lossy channels is analyzed theoretically .",
    "we find that , for any value of @xmath0 , the resulting 2-photon state is a ",
    "werner state  @xcite , i.e. , a superposition of a maximally entangled ( singlet ) state with a fully mixed state .",
    "this condition is investigated thoroughly by exploiting the extensive knowledge available on the werner states and modern techniques like the  entanglement witness  and the various forms of state entropy @xcite .",
    "resilience of entanglement is theoretically demonstrated for any value of @xmath0  in the high loss @xmath5  approximation @xcite .  in section iii ,",
    "the results of the theory are compared with the corresponding experimental data obtained by conventional quantum state tomography @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we theoretically analyze the effect of losses on @xmath4 spdcmultiphoton state .",
    "recently durkin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the persistence of some kind of symmetries implying entanglement in multiphoton spdc states in presence of polarization independent photon losses .",
    "here we explicitly derive the expression of the spdc density matrix in regime of induced high photon losses through coincidence measurements and demonstrate that it corresponds to a werner state for any value of @xmath0 . in the present model effects of both losses and imperfect detections on the output states are simulated , as usual , by the insertion of beam splitters on the two propagation modes @xmath7 @xmath8 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the results of this study demonstrate the resilience of bipartite entanglement for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that , even in absence of these induced losses , the initial spdc  state is entangled for any @xmath0 , because of the basic impossibility of creating or enhancing the entanglement by means of local operations acting on non entangled state @xcite .",
    "the  main motivations for the present investigation resides in the experimental entanglement assessment on multi - photon hg fields by introducing light absorbing filters on the correlated photons paths .",
    "the approximate expression of the density matrix also provides an intuitive explanation of the behavior of spdc states in the hg  and hl regimes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spdc process in the interaction picture reads @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the creation operators associated with the spatial propagation mode @xmath7 , with polarization @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for horizontal and vertical polarization .",
    "@xmath14 is a coupling constant which depends on the crystal nonlinearity and is proportional to the amplitude of the pump beam .",
    "this hamiltonian generates a unitary transformation @xmath15acting on the input vacuum state @xmath16 .",
    "the output state @xmath17 is easily obtained in virtue of the disentangling theorem @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-generated pairs term : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 . the parameter @xmath24 expresses the nl gain of the parametric process , being @xmath25 the interaction time .",

    "furthermore , perfect detectors with @xmath30 measure the output state @xcite ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the symmetry of the entangled state after losses is preserved by assuming @xmath29 to be mode- and polarization- independent .",
    "the contribution @xmath19 to the spdc state is expressed in terms of the bs operators @xmath31 associated with the input modes @xmath32 : @xmath33    the bs s couple the input modes @xmath32 with the transmitted modes @xmath34 and the reflected modes @xmath35 the output state expression is found by substituting the operators @xmath36 with their expressions in term of the operators @xmath37 , associated with the output transmitted modes @xmath38 , and the operators@xmath39 , associated with the output reflected modes @xmath40 , through the bs input - output matrix @xcite : @xmath41 the input state @xmath19 evolves into an output state @xmath42 which is defined over the four transmitted modes and the four reflected modes .",
    "this state is expressed through the fock states : @xmath43 where the first term in the tensor product represents modes transmitted by the bs and hence detected ( @xmath44modes ) while the second term expresses the reflected modes ( @xmath45modes ) .",

    "since we are interested in the reduced density matrix @xmath51 defined over the transmitted modes @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath51= @xmath52 ^{out}$ ] , we need to trace @xmath46 over the undetected reflected modes .",
    "the result is : @xmath53    the final expression for the @xmath20-pair contribution to the spdc density matrix is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "up to now we have considered arbitrary , polarization - symmetric losses . in the following we make the  additional assumption of very large losses , i.e. hl , which greatly simplifies our task .",
    "such approximation is expressed by the relation @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the average number of photon transmitted by the bs per mode .",
    "this condition enables us to take into account only the terms of the sum eq.7 of order @xmath60 , hence considering only matrix element corresponding to no more than two photons transmitted . as final step , we assume to detect one photon on each mode @xmath61 by a 2-photon coincidence technique . in this way the vacuum terms affecting one or both vectors @xmath61 are dropped . in summary ,",
    "this coincidence procedure guarantees , by post - selection , that we are dealing only with matrix elements arising from the tensor product of the states:@xmath62 , which correspond to the states @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath20-pair contribution @xmath64 to the spdc 2-photon density matrix hence reads @xmath65 we note that the above density matrix has the form of a werner state @xmath66 , with @xmath67 which is a mixture with probability @xmath68 of the maximally entangled state@xmath69 and of the  maximally chaotic state @xmath70 being @xmath71  the identity operator on the overall hilbert space .",
    "these states are commonly adopted in qi , since they model a decoherence process occurring on a singlet state traveling along an isotropic noisy channel @xcite .",
    "the complete density matrix for the spdc output state is obtained by substituting the @xmath64 matrices into the expression @xmath72 .",
    "all the terms @xmath64 sum up incoherently .",
    "let us explain the latter procedure .",
    "in the actual conditions any @xmath73 $ ] leads , after the bs action , to two transmitted photons and @xmath74 reflected photons .",
    "different @xmath20 number of input pairs lead to the discard of a different numbers of reflected photons , hence any mutual coherence is destroyed after the tracing operation .",
    "the normalized density matrix turns out to be : @xmath75    the spdc density matrix @xmath76 , given by the sum of werner states , is a werner state itself , with singlet weight @xmath77 with @xmath78 . in the limit @xmath79 , @xmath80 . for large values of @xmath0  ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath81 , and in the hypothesis of very high losses , the singlet weight @xmath82 approaches the minimum value @xmath83 .",
    "since the condition @xmath84 implies the well known non - separability condition for a general werner state , we have demonstrated for large @xmath0 the expected high resilience against de - coherence of the entangled singlet state @xcite .",
    "the graph of fig.2 shows the behavior of singlet weight @xmath68 as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the previous theoretical results have been experimentally tested for different values of the parametric nl - gain @xmath0 : fig.3 . the main source was a @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 mode - locked laser further amplified by a @xmath85 regenerative @xmath86 @xmath88 @xmath89 device @xmath90  operating with pulse duration @xmath91 the amplifier could operate either at a repetition rate @xmath92 or @xmath93 leading to an energy per pulse , respectively , of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
