    "meta - materials with negative permittivity and negative permeability , which were first suggested in @xcite , have attracted much attention recently . a meta - material which has simultaneously negative permittivity @xmath0 and negative permeability @xmath1 within a certain frequency band at microwave frequencies has been introduced recently @xcite .",
    "this structure consists of two lattices : a lattice of infinitely long parallel wires , and a lattice of relatively small ( compared to the wavelength @xmath2 in the host medium ) particles which are called _ split - ring resonators _ ( srr : s ) . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "two analytical models of srr ( similar to each other ) have been developed for the resonant permeability at microwave frequencies .",
    "lattices of wires at low frequencies ( when the lattice period @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath4 ) were considered as homogenuous dielectric media long time ago in @xcite and were studied again recently in the low - frequency region @xcite . at these low frequencies",
    "the negative permittivity is due to the lattice of wires according to the models of @xcite ( for waves propagating normally to the wires with the electric field polarized along these wires ) .",
    "these results were combined in @xcite to form a simple model predicting simultaneously negative @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the resonant band of a srr . in @xcite",
    "this prediction has been qualitatively confirmed by numerical simulations using the mafia code .",
    "dispersion curves obtained numerically contain the pass - band within the srr resonant band ( due to the presence of the srr lattice ) . this pass - band",
    "can also be predicted by the analytical model .",
    "however , the numerical dispersion data obtained in @xcite have not been used to extract the material parameters .",
    "the experimental observation of the negative refraction of a wave in such a structure is reported in @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of the negative refraction was predicted in @xcite for media with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and according to this theory they correspond to the backward wave region ( where the poynting vector of the eigenwave is opposite to the wave vector ) .",
    "does the experimental observation of @xcite mean that the structure suggested in @xcite can be described through @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are both negative within the srr resonant band ? based on",
    "@xcite one can only assert that the backward wave region necessarily exists within this frequency band .",
    "backward waves in a lattice correspond to negative dispersion , i.e. , the group velocity ( the derivative of the eigenfrequency with respect to the wave number ) is in the opposite direction of the phase velocity .",
    "negative dispersion for a lattice is quite common in high frequency bands ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wave number in the host medium ) .",
    "however , at low frequencies ( @xmath9 ) negative dispersion is an abnormal phenomenon .",
    "when @xmath9 the wavelength @xmath2 is high enough as compared to the lattice period and the srr size and thus the homogenization of the lattice may be possible .",
    "in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite the lattice at low frequencies was treated as a continuous medium and the concept of the negative dispersion is equivalent to the concept of negative material parameters .",
    "however , is it possible to describe the structure formed by lattices of wires and srr : s ( studied in @xcite and @xcite ) in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the resonant band of srr : s ?",
    "this question remains open since the analytical model @xcite with which these material parameters were introduced is incomplete and can be wrong .",
    "in @xcite the negative refraction was observed only for waves whose electric field is parallel to the wires and the wave vector is perpendicular to the wires .",
    "thus , the permittivity @xmath0 considered in @xcite and @xcite are the @xmath10component of the permittivity tensor ( we assume the wires are along the @xmath11-axis ) and the permeability @xmath1 considered there are the transversal component of the permeability tensor @xmath12 ( there are two orthogonal srr : s in each unit cell of the structure studied in @xcite ) .",
    "if one considers only the propagation in the transversal plane ( i.e. , the @xmath13 plane in our case ) , one can neglect the spatial dispersion in the wire lattice and consider it as a medium with negative permittivity @xcite . in the case of perfectly conducting wires",
    "one has @xcite : = 1-_p^2 ^ 2 where @xmath14 is the analogue of the plasma frequency . in @xcite",
    "the following frequency dependencies of the effective medium parameters were suggested for their structure when both the srr particles and the wires are made of real metal : = 1-_p^2-_e^2 ^ 2-_e^2-j = 1-_mp^2-_m^2 ^ 2-_m^2-j where @xmath15 is the analogue of the resonant frequency of a magnetic plasma , @xmath16 is the electronic resonant frequency and @xmath17 is the magnetic resonant frequency ( i.e. , , the resonant frequency of the magnetic polarizaibility for an individual srr ) .",
    "these formulas correspond to the conventional quasi - static model for the permittivity and permeability , which takes into account only the local interaction in the structure under the homogenization ( i.e. , the electromagnetic interaction between the ssr : s and wires are neglected ) . in the present paper , we take into account the electromagnetic interaction ( including the plane - wave interaction ) between the ssr : s and the wires .",
    "we consider the lossless case ( corresponding to @xmath18 in and ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we also discuss the following two questions :    * is it possible to consider the structure formed by lattices of wires and srr : s as a medium that its @xmath0 is the same as the effective permittivity of a wire medium and its @xmath1 is the same as the effective permeability of the lattice of srr : s ( i.e. , is it possible to neglect the electromagnetic interaction between the srr : s and the wires when calculating the material parameters of the whole structure ) ? * how to find the frequency region within the resonant band of srr scatterers in which the homogenization of the whole structure is allowed ? at some frequencies within the srr resonant band",
    "the homogenization model may give so high values of the effective permeability that the product @xmath19 becomes very large .",
    "though the wavelength @xmath2 in the host medium is much larger than the lattice period @xmath3 , the effective wavelength @xmath20 of the eigenmode at these frequencies can be of the order of @xmath3 or even smaller and thus the homogenization model becomes contradictory .",
    "however , within the band of the resonance there are frequencies at which the product @xmath19 is not so large .",
    "thus , the problem is how to separate quantitatively the frequencies at which the homogenization is forbidden from the frequencies at which the homogenization is allowed .",
    "the first question has been considered briefly in @xcite .",
    "it was indicated that the structure considered in @xcite was fortunately built so that each srr is located exactly at the center of two adjacent wires and thus there is no quasi - static interaction between the wire lattice and the srr lattice ( i.e. , the magnetic fields produced by the two adjacent equivalent line currents cancel out at the center where the srr is located ) .",
    "if one considers @xmath0 and @xmath1 as quasi - static parameters ( as was done in @xcite ) , the absence of the quasi - static interaction should lead to the following result : the effective permittivity of the structure is identical to the effective permittivity of the lattice of wires and the effective permeability of the structure is identical to the effective permeability of the lattice of srr : s .",
    "however , we will show in the present paper that this is not correct since the electromagnetic interaction between the wires and the srr : s in such a structure is not quasi - static ( or local ) and will dramatically influence the effective permittivity .",
    "the consideration of structure as lattice of wires positioned in a host negative magnetic suggested in @xcite is not adequate , because it also does not describe electromagnetic interaction correctly .    for the second question",
    ", one must be very careful in the homogenization of the complex structure studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the results of @xcite can not be interpreted quantitatively in terms of the permittivity and permeability used in @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this has been revealed in @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we develop an analytical model for a structure similar to the one studied in @xcite ( i.e. , formed by combined lattices of infinitely long wires and split - ring resonators ) .",
    "the model allows the structure to be homogenized and its valid frequency domain to be identified .",
    "a self - consistent dispersion equation is derived and then used to calculate correctly the effective permittivity and permeability in the frequency band where the lattice can be homogenized .",
    "the backward wave region ( which is a part of the resonant band of srr ) in which both the effective permittivity and permeability are negative is analysized . since our homogenization",
    "is based on the dispersion characteristics of the structure , the extracted material parameters are not quasi - static ( i.e. , not only the local but also the non - local interactions are considered among the elements of the structure ) .",
    "our results have shown that the homogenization is allowed only over part of the resonant band of the srr scatterers and the homogenization is forbidden in a sub - band inside the srr resonant band ( even though the frequencies of this sub - band are low and the spatial dispersion exists there ) .",
    "the srr particle considered in @xcite and @xcite is a pair of two coplanar broken rings .",
    "since the two loops are not identical the analytical model for this particle is rather cumbersome ( srr models more complete than those suggested in @xcite and @xcite have been developed in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is not correct that the srr particle can be described simply as a resonant magnetic scatterer @xcite .",
    "the structure considered in @xcite ( if homogenized ) has to be described through three material parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 ( the magnetoelectric coupling parameter ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a srr is actually a bianisotropic particle and the role of bianisotropy is destructive for negative refraction .",
    "the bianisotropy is not the only disadvantage of this srr particle .",
    "another disadvantage is its resonant electric polarizability ( i.e. , the polarization produced by the electric field ) , which was also ignored in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "electric polarizability resonance occurs at frequencies very close to the resonant frequency of the magnetic polarizability @xcite . if the srr : s are made of real metal , the resonant electric polarizability will lead to a dramatic increase in the resistive loss .",
    "the resonant electric polarizability also makes the analytical modelling of the whole structure very complicated .",
    "a modified srr which does not possess bianisotropy was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this srr also consists of two loops but they are identical and parallel to each other ( located on both sides of a dielectric plate in practice ) . fig .",
    "[ marques ] shows two kinds of srr .",
    "the left one is the srr considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the right is the srr introduced in @xcite and the one considered in the present paper .",
    "it has been mentioned in @xcite that the magnetic resonant frequency of their srr is lower than that of the srr considered in @xcite and @xcite ( for the same size ) .",
    "this is because the mutual capacitance @xmath22 between the two parallel broken rings is now the capacitance of a conventional parallel - plate capacitor and is significantly higher than the mutual capacitance of two coplanar split rings considered in @xcite .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ marques ] : if the upper half of ring 1 is charged positively the negative induced charges appear in the upper half of ring 2 .",
    "the same situation happens for the srr shown in the left part of this figure , but not so effectively since the strips are coplanar and weakly interacted .",
    "therefore , the homogenization is more appropriate within the resonant band of the particle since the ratio of the particle size to @xmath2 is small .",
    "there is one more advantage that was not mentioned in @xcite for the srr of two parallel broken rings .",
    "the resonances of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of this particle do not overlap in frequency . actually , particle suggested in @xcite is a special case of the bi - helix particle introduced ( with the aim to create novel low - reflective shields ) and studied in @xcite . unlike the srr considered in @xcite this bi - helix particle contains four stems orthogonal to the loop planes .",
    "note that the theory of @xcite remains valid even if the length of these stems becomes zero .",
    "both rings 1 and 2 ( see the right diagram of fig .",
    "[ marques ] ) have the same radius @xmath23 and area @xmath24 .",
    "the impedance @xmath25 for each broken ring can be calculated by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the admittance for the corresponding closed ring and @xmath28 is the admittance for the split ( associated with the capacitance between the two broken ends ) .",
    "the magnetization arises due to the magnetic field orthogonal to the ring plane ( i.e. , the @xmath29 plane in fig .",
    "[ marques ] ) .",
    "resonant electric polarization is caused by the @xmath30component of the external local electric field @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath11-component of @xmath31 has no influence over the resonant polarization and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , voltages ( electromotive forces ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 will be induced in each loop by the external local electric and magnetic fields , respectively @xcite , @xcite : ^h =- j_0 sh_z^loc , and ^e=4r j_1(kr)z_0ja_1(kr ) ( 1 + j(y_ring+y_split ) ) e_y^loc , where @xmath34 is the derivative ( with respect to the argument ) of the bessel function , and @xmath35 is one of the so - called king s coefficients known in the theory of loop antennas ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then the induced currents @xmath36 ( due to the changing of the charges at the tips of the split arms ) at the split gaps of rings 1 and 2 satisfy the following equations , @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mutual impedance of the two broken rings .",
    "it is clear from and that there are two eigenmodes of currents in the srr .",
    "the first mode corresponds to @xmath39 when the electric dipole moment of the srr is zero and the magnetic dipole moment @xmath40 is twice the magnetic moment of a single ring ( see fig .",
    "[ marques ] ) .",
    "the second mode corresponds to @xmath41 when the magnetic moment is zero and the electric dipole moment @xmath42 of the srr is twice the electric dipole moment of a single ring .",
    "the first mode in the srr is excited by the local magnetic field , and the second mode is exceited by the local electric field . the more the two rings are mutually coupled , the more is the difference between the resonant frequencies of the electric and magnetic resonantors @xcite .",
    "the electric resonant frequency ( at which the electric polarizability resonates ) is always higher than the magnetic resonant frequency @xcite .",
    "the relative difference of these two resonant frequencies may exceed @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "if the distance @xmath44 between the two parallel broken rings is very small , we can assume that the mutual coupling is so strong that the electric polarizability of the ssr is negligible within the frequency band of the magnetic resonance .",
    "note that @xmath44 is also the thickness of the dielectric layer between the two parallel broken rings in fig .",
    "[ marques ] since the rings are assumed to be perfectly conducting with infinitesimal thickness .",
    "therefore , unlike the ssr considered in @xcite and @xcite , the ssr suggested in @xcite is appropriate for creating artificial magnetic resonance without resonant electric properties within the frequency band of interest .",
    "this is the reason why we choose the ssr shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ marques ] to study in the present paper ( the analysis will be much simpler ) .    in the present paper we introduce an analytical model for an individual srr particle used in @xcite .",
    "this model is simpler than the one considered in @xcite ( due to the absence of the stems ) .",
    "assume that the srr shown in figure [ marques ] is made of perfectly conducting strip and is excited by magnetic field @xmath45 .",
    "also assume that the dielectric plate separating the two parallel rings has the same permittivity as the background medium ( then we can avoid the influence of the dielectric plate which can be very strong if there is a mismatch in the permittivity ) .",
    "the model used in this section is quasi - static since it refers to an isolated particle of small size ( with respect to the wavelength ) .",
    "if the non - uniformity of the azimuthal current distribution in both rings and srr : s can be neglected , the magnetic polarizability can be written as a_mm = mh_z^loc=2i_0sh_z^loc where @xmath46 . from and it follows that i = e^hz_0+z_mut =- js_0h_z^locz_0+z_mut    calculating the total impedance of the loop by taking into account the mutual coupling of the loops ( as it was done in @xcite and @xcite for srr of coplanar rings ) , we obtain @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the radiation resistance of the whole particle , @xmath49 is the ring inductance : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the width of the strip from which the ring is made of , and @xmath52 is the mutual inductance of the two parallel coaxial rings : @xmath53\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .",
    "the total capacitance @xmath55 attributed to the split can be calculated ( taking into account the capacitive mutual coupling ; cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) as half of the mutual capacitance formed by the two parallel rings @xmath56 in this formula the capacitance of the split is neglected since it is small as compared to @xmath22 .    from",
    "and we obtain a_mm= 2_0 ^ 2s^2(l+l_mut)(_0 ^ 2 ^ 2 - 1)-jr_r where _",
    "0 ^ 2=1c_tot(l+l_mut ) in a similar way one can show that the electric polarizability resonates at the frequency @xmath57 ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we will also use the following result of : ( 1a_mm)=(l+l_mut)(_0 ^ 2 ^ 2 - 1)2_0 ^ 2s^2    the radiation resistance @xmath48 can be found from the following condition @xcite : ( 1a_mm)=k^36_0 in the dispersion equation for a lattice , @xmath48 cancels out and does not influence the result .",
    "the structure we study in the present paper is similar to the one studied experimentally in @xcite , however , instead of the coplanar srr : s we use the parallel srr : s ( as described in the previous section ) .    when the wave propagates along the @xmath60 axis the electric field excites the @xmath61directed current @xmath62 in the wire numbered @xmath63 ( for the reference wire we have @xmath64 ) .",
    "the magnetic field excites those srr : s which are parallel to the @xmath65 plane .",
    "their magnetic moments are parallel to the @xmath66 axis . then the lattice can be considered as a set of 2d grids parallel to the @xmath67 plane and orthogonal to the propagation direction .",
    "each grid contains magnetic and electric polarizations .",
    "the magnetic moments as well as the currents are tangential to the grid plane , and each grid can be considered as a sheet of surface magnetic moment @xmath68 and a surface electric current @xmath69 ( or surface electric polarization @xmath70 ) .",
    "similar situation holds for the wave propagation along the @xmath66 axis .",
    "then one has @xmath71 and @xmath69 , and the electric and magnetic polarizations for each 2d grid ( parallel to the @xmath65 plane ) is again tangential to the grid and orthogonal to the propagation direction .",
    "the wire lattice and the srr lattice have the same periods along the @xmath66 and @xmath60 axes and are denoted as @xmath72 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the period of the srr lattice along the @xmath11 axis is denoted as @xmath73 .",
    "[ marques ] shows the two orthogonal sets of srr : s separated with each other by @xmath74 along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "this separation plays no role in our model since we do not consider the electromagnetic interaction between these two orthogonal sets of magnetic dipoles . when the wave propagates along the @xmath60 axis or @xmath66 axis , one of the two sets of srr : s is not excited and the interaction is completely absent .",
    "in the case @xmath75 such a structure behaves ( within the frequency band where the homogenization is possible ) like a uniaxial magneto - dielectric medium with relative axial permittivity @xmath76 ( mainly due to the presence of the wires ) and relative transversal permeability @xmath77 ( mainly due to the srr particles ) .",
    "this indicates that in order to find the effective material parameters of the whole structure we can consider only the case of the normal propagation ( along the @xmath60 or @xmath66 axis ) .",
    "note that the transversal permittivity and the axial permeability of the structure are equal to those of the background medium . for simplicity",
    "we assume this background medium is vacuum .",
    "we will see that the srr : s strongly interact with the wires at each frequency .",
    "their interaction is not quasi - static and influences the propagation constant starting from zero frequency . in this way it influences the material parameters of the whole structure .",
    "let the wave propagate along the @xmath60 axis with propagation factor @xmath78 ( to be determined ) .",
    "consider the whole structure as a set of parallel 2d grids which are parallel to the @xmath67 plane and denote the surface magnetic moments @xmath79 and the surface currents @xmath80 at those grids numbered @xmath81 .",
    "then we choose an arbitrary srr in the grid with @xmath82 as the reference particle and an arbitrarily chosen wire ( in the same grid ) as the reference wire .",
    "when we evaluate the magnetic moment @xmath83 of the reference srr ( which is related to the surface magnetic moment @xmath84 by @xmath85 ) , we take into account its electromagnetic interaction with all the other srr : s following the work of @xcite where a simple model of 3d dipole lattice was suggested . as to the influence of the wires to the reference srr",
    ", we can replace each grid of wires with a sheet of current @xmath80 because of the absence of the a quasi - static interaction between srr : s and wires .",
    "this gives the well - known plane - wave approximation of the electromagnetic interaction in lattices ( see @xcite and the references cited there ) .",
    "when we evaluate the current @xmath86 of the reference wire ( which is related to the surface electric current by @xmath87 ) , we take into account its interaction with all the other wires following the work of @xcite where a simple model of doubly - periodic wire lattice was suggested .",
    "the influence of the srr lattice on the reference wire is taken into account under the plane - wave approximation and the reciprocity principle is satisfied .",
    "each sheet of electric or magnetic polarization produces a plane wave @xcite .",

    "the existence of this real part of @xmath78 reflects the fact that the directions of the currents in the wires are alternating along the propagation axis ( two adjacent currents have opposite directions and this can be interpreted as the phase shift @xmath140 between them due to the real part of the complex propagation factor ) .",
    "therefore , the homogenization is possible within one ( the upper ) half of the srr resonant band but impossible within another ( the lower ) half of the srr resonant band ( though for these frequencies the structure periods are much smaller than the wavelength in the background medium ) .",
    "let us try to consider the structure ( in the case @xmath141 ) as a uniaxial magneto - dielectric medium .",
    "then the interacting wave ( propagating along the @xmath60 axis with @xmath122,@xmath123 ) also satisfies the following constitutive equations : @xmath142 @xmath143 define the following ratio : = = 1 ( _ xx-1)e_xh_y where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the field components averaged over the cubic cell @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 are the bulk electric and magnetic polarizations related with the surface current @xmath89 and surface magnetic polarization : @xmath149 from maxwell s equations we easily obtain =    substituting and into , we obtain : @xmath150 - from and it follows that = ( _ xx-1 ) in the above equation @xmath151 is already known from the dispersion curve and @xmath152 .",
    "equating the propagation factor @xmath78 to the value @xmath153 , we obtain _ t=^2k^2_xx substituting this expression for @xmath154 into , we obtain : _",
    "xx()=c^2 ^ 2()^2 + c()1 + ( ) k ( ) after @xmath76 is found , we then evaluate @xmath154 through ( cf . and ) _",
    "t()= 1+c()()1+c ( ) ( )    we have taken into account the non - local interaction in the structure in formulas and though the effective permittivity and permeability are introduced as the parameters relating @xmath155 with @xmath156 at the same point . therefore , unlike formulas and , our material parameters are not quasi - static .",
    "frequency dependencies of both @xmath76 and @xmath154 are shown in fig .",
    "[ wide ] for the case @xmath131 mm . outside the resonant band of the srr particles the frequency dependence of the permittivity",
    "repeats the known result for wire media ( treated as artificial dielectric media ) @xcite .",
    "the permeability is practically equal to the unity outside the resonant band of srr : s . within the complex - mode band",
    "the homogenization is forbidden @xcite and this frequency region is removed in this figure ( both @xmath76 and @xmath154 calculated through and are complex within this band ) .",
    "let us consider the resonant frequency behavior of the material parameters in details .",
    "[ wide2 ] shows the same curves as those in fig .",
    "[ wide ] , however , in another scale starting from the upper limit of the complex - mode band . from fig .",
    "[ wide2 ] one sees that the permittivity and permeability are both negative between 5.970 and 6.020 ghz . from fig .",
    "[ respas ] it follows that the backward wave propagates between 5.980 ghz and 6.045 ghz .",
    "thus , the backward - wave region almost coincides with the region where both the permittivity and permeability are negative .",
    "note that this coincidence is only approximate .",
    "also we have indicated in fig .",
    "[ wide2 ] the point at which permittivity and permeability are equal ( at about 6.005 ghz ) . at this frequency , the medium is impedance - matched with the free space ( this is useful for some applications ) and the values of @xmath76 and @xmath157 are not very high ( the homogenization is then allowed ) .    as a main result , one can see from fig .",
    "[ wide2 ] that the permittivity does not follow ( within the resonant band ) the law ( even qualitatively ) suggested in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it s the frequency dependence of the permittivity is non - monotonous ( from fig .",
    "[ wide2 ] one sees that @xmath76 decreases over 5.96 - 6.09 and increases after 6.090 ghz as the frequency increases ) .    in the theory of continuous media",
    "one can prove that both the permittivity and permeability must grow as the frequency increases in the lossless case @xcite . in our case",
    "the permeability grows everywhere as the frequency increases ( until the first spatial resonance of the lattice , i.e. , @xmath158 when it loses the physical meaning ) .",
    "thus , the frequency behavior of the permeability is normal .",
    "however , the permittivity grows as the frequency increases only at the frequencies when the magnetization of srr is small and the interaction of the srr : s and wires is negligible . within the band of the backward wave",
    "the permittivity decreases as the frequency increases .",
    "therefore , the homogenization procedure we have developed is not completely consistent with the theory of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this disagreement is that the material parameters considered in @xcite are quasi - static ( i.e. , the polarization of the medium at a given point is determined by the field at this point ) while our model takes into account the non - local interaction of the srr lattice and the wire lattice .",
    "we found that the visible difference between the quasi - static model and our model is within the srr resonant band .",
    "however , the influence of the non - local interaction is revealed in the permittivity of the wire lattice disturbed by the presence of the srr : s .",
    "the lattice of infinite wires is spatially dispersive at all frequencies since the wires are longer than any possible wavelength .",
    "when the wave propagates strictly in the plane orthogonal to the axis of the wires one can still neglect the spatial dispersion since all parameters are independent of the @xmath11-coordinate .",
    "thus , the problem is two - dimensional and possible to be homogenized @xcite .",
    "however , if there is a lattice of scatterers with which the wires interact , the situation becomes quite different ( even for propagation orthogonal to the wires ) . here",
    "the problem is not two - dimensional and the wire current is influenced by all the srr particles positioned along its infinite length .",
    "it results in the abnormal frequency behavior of the effective permittivity of the structure .",
    "in the present paper we have developed an analytical model for a structure similar to the one for which the negative refraction at microwave frequencies was first observed ( formed by combined lattices of infinitely long wires and split - ring resonators ) @xcite .",
    "we have derived a self - consistent dispersion equation and studied the dispersion properties of the lattice .",
    "the explicit dispersion equation clearly confirms the existence of the narrow pass - band within the resonant band of the split - ring resonators . in this pass - band",
    "the group and phase velocities of the propagating wave are in opposite directions ( i.e. , a backward wave ) .",
    "negative refraction is the direct consequence of the backward wave ( instead of the negative values of permittivity and permeability as thought in many works @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the experimental observations of @xcite are consistent to our model .",
    "our model also allows the homogenization of the composite structure .",
    "the obtained dispersion curves have been used to calculate correctly the effective permittivity and permeability in the frequency band where the structure can be homogenized .",
    "it is interesting to see that the dispersion curves agree well with the veselago theory which predicts backward waves when both permittivity and permeability are negative .",
    "outside the resonant band of the srr particles , the effective permittivity of the whole structure is the same as that of the wire lattice and the effective permeability is equal to 1 .",
    "however , within the srr resonant band , there is a sub - band where the homogenization is forbidden since the complex mode satisfies the dispersion equation at these frequencies .",
    "we found that the frequency region in which both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are negative coincides approximately with the backward wave band . in this region",
    "the frequency dependence of the effective permittivity is abnormal .",
    "we interpret this as the result of the low - frequency spatial dispersion which is inherent for the wire medium in the presence of the resonant scatterers .",
