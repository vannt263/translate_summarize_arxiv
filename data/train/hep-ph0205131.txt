    "with the evidences for neutrino mass becoming stronger , we have reached a stage where it is becoming possible to contemplate probing the detailed structure of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the initial evidences for neutrino mixing from solar and the atmospheric neutrino data have now been confirmed by several experiments@xcite . from the recent results of super - kamiokande and sno experiments",
    ", it now appears that the choice for neutrino mixings and therefore the possible profiles for the neutrino mass matrix within the three neutrino framework have been considerably narrowed .",
    "there are also evidences for new structures in neutrino masses from the lsnd@xcite and heidelberg - moscow neutrinoless double beta decay experiments@xcite .",
    "these latter results need confirmation .",
    "however , if they are included in the neutrino mass analysis , they have a profound effect the nature of new physics- for example confirmation of the lsnd results would imply that there are four neutrinos rather than three , the fourth one being a `` sterile '' neutrino . similarly ,",
    "if the present results of the heidelberg - moscow @xmath4 are confirmed@xcite , then for the first time , we would have at hand a piece of information that oscillation experiments are unable to provide , i.e. the overall scale of the neutrino masses . in this paper",
    ", we will take the conservative approach and consider the implications of only the solar and the atmospheric neutrino results within a three neutrino framework . in this case",
    ", the mixing pattern is very nearly fixed by the solar and atmospheric data along with important constraints coming from chooz - palo - verde experiments@xcite .",
    "the general majorana mass matrix for three neutrinos has nine parameters ; three mass eigenvalues , @xmath5 , three mixing angles and three phases .",
    "of the three phases , only one is observable in oscillation expriments .",
    "the final goal of neutrino physics is to determine all these parameters , assuming there are only three neutrinos ( as we do in this paper ) .    to fit the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments",
    ", we will make the following choice of mixing angles , which we will incorporate into our analysis , i.e.    \\(i ) mixing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is nearly maximal and    \\(ii ) there is large mixing between @xmath8 and the other active neutrinos .",
    "the next piece of information necessary for our analysis is the mass pattern for neutrinos .",
    "the data at the moment does not choose between    \\(i ) hierarchical , i.e. @xmath9 ,    \\(ii ) inverted , i.e. @xmath10 or    \\(iii ) degenerate , i.e. @xmath11 patterns .",
    "we will choose for our discussion the inverted pattern since that corresponds to a very elegant leptonic symmetry , @xmath0@xcite .",
    "models with this symmetry have been extensively discussed in literature@xcite .",
    "we will here follow the spirit of the paper@xcite , where two plausible models for approximate @xmath0 symmetry were considered :    \\(i ) where the symmetry was broken by planck scale effects and    \\(ii ) where the charged lepton mass matrix was the source of leptonic symmetry breaking .",
    "the first case leads to the so called low solution for the solar neutrino problem and predicts that kamland experiment currently running@xcite should not see a signal .",
    "it also predicts that the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the second case , for large @xmath13 susy models leads to the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem and has a correlation between the @xmath3 and @xmath1 . in this note",
    "we present a detailed phenomenological analysis of the most general class of such models .",
    "the motivation for exploring such symmetries of leptonic sector are manyfold .",
    "historically , symmetries have played a guiding role in the progress of particle physics as exemplified by symmetries such as isospin , su(3 ) , color , electrweak symmetries etc . secondly ,",
    "if the existence of leptonic symmetries is established , that would make the leptons completely different from quarks and ideas such as quark - lepton unification would not be indicated in physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this will have implications for the nature of possible grand unification theories e.g. with leptonic symmetries , it will be hard to envision unification such as so(10 ) ; instead unification schemes based on [ su(3)]@xmath14 may be preferred .",
    "this note focusses on three issues : ( a ) first , the numerical analysis of the most general majorana neutrino mass matrix consistent with weakly broken @xmath0 symmetry in a basis where charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and ( b ) a second case , where the symmetry is exact in the neutrino mass matrix but broken in the charged lepton masses as in ref.@xcite and ( c ) theoretical scenarios that make definite predictions for the pattern of @xmath0 breaking in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we derive sumrules involving the parameters of the mass matrix and the observables @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the mixing parameter @xmath3 for case ( a ) and find strong correlation between these parameters . in particular we find that @xmath1 in this case is necessarily more than @xmath17 .",
    "this makes it possible to confront these models with the next generation neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we then discuss case ( b ) which will be one way to proceed in this framework if the value of @xmath1 determined by kamland and future solar neutrino experiments turns out to be smaller than @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", we observe a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "for the specific breaking pattern in the charged lepton sector described in @xcite , we find a somewhat relaxed lower bound of @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "case ( c ) presents an example of a model , where @xmath12 is a natural consequence without contradicting any known results .",
    "we also apply our sumrules to discuss the effective three neutrino models derived from 3 + 1@xcite models for lsnd@xcite based on the same symmetry @xciteusing the seesaw mechanism@xcite . depending on whether these models are ruled out or confirmed , it can provide important information on the direction of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "before discussing the phenomenology of the model of interest , we repeat a few basic formulae well known in the literature in order to set the notation .",
    "we express the flavor ( or weak ) eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath20 where we will use @xmath21 , @xmath22 for the flavor index and @xmath23 , @xmath24 for the mass eigenstates index .",
    "@xmath25 are element of the mixing matrix which diagonalizes the mass matrix of the neutrinos .",
    "the basic formula for the transition probability between two weak eigenstates is given by @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath28    experimental data suggest ( i ) two distinct mass scales that characterize the solar and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations : @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 and ( ii ) @xmath3 very small . in this approximation",
    ", the analysis of the two oscillations can be separated effectively into @xmath32 oscillations .",
    "+ under the first approximation , the survival probability is , for atmospheric neutrino , @xmath33 for solar neutrino @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are both proportional to @xmath37 and so the oscillation amplitude of atmospheric @xmath8 is suppressed .",
    "note that the analysis becomes effectively that of two neutrino oscillation . from the above equation",
    ", we can read out the mixing angle @xmath38 note that the above formulae for the survival probabilities remain valid even in the presence of complex phases in the mixing matrices .",
    "we will use these formulae in deriving the effective mixing angles for the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "in order to explore the possible existence of symmetries in the lepton sector of physics beyond the standard model , we consider two cases in this section . in the first one we allow the most general small symmetry breaking terms in the neutrino mass mass matrix keeping the charged lepton sector completely symmetry conserving and in the second case , we keep the neutrino sector symmetry conserving and allow small breakings in the charged lepton sector .",
    "in the subsequent section we discuss physics scenarios where these two cases can arise .      in this section , we will consider the neutrino mass matrix for the case with weakly broken @xmath0 symmetry in the neutrino sector .",
    "we will assume the dominant terms to respect @xmath0 symmetry with the symmetry breaking terms to be less than one third of the symmetry preserving ones and work in the perturbative approximation of these parameters .",
    "we find sumrules that relate the symmetry breaking parameters to the observables in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "one can then use these to test for the possible existence of the leptonic symmetry @xmath0 .    to proceed with the derivation of the sumrules ,",
    "we write down the neutrino mass matrix in the exact symmetry limit i. e. @xmath39 we add to it the symmetry breaking matrix of the following general form : @xmath40 the full neutrino mass matrix is @xmath41 .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix can be cast into a diagonal form in this basis in the symmetry limit by redefining the parameters @xmath42 and angle @xmath43 . in this example",
    "we do not assume any symmetry breaking terms in the charged leptn sector .    in the perturbative approximation , we find the following sumrules involving the neutrino observables and the elements of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the two obvious relations are @xmath44 the nontrivial relations that also hold for this model are : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 in eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) represents the small parameters in the mass matrix .",
    "these equations represent one of the main results of this paper .",
    "below we study their implications .",
    "finally , there is the relation @xmath50 .",
    "this is an exact relation with no @xmath51 corrections .",
    "note that in the first of the two equations in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , if we set @xmath52 , we get a relation which is similar to the one that holds in the zee model@xcite but apparently valid for a wider class of models",
    ".    experimental data requires @xmath53 , which implies that our model predicts @xmath54 for @xmath55 . combining this with the mean value for the @xmath56",
    ", we predict that the effective neutrino mass in the neutrinoless double beta decay in this case is given by @xmath57 ev . the detailed correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath58",
    "is given in fig .",
    "it includes also the second order perturbation effects not present in eq.(9 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we present the predictions for @xmath3 in this model . we see that @xmath3 is pretty much allowed up to its present limit .",
    "therefore , this model can be tested once the kamland experiment is complete assuming that it confirms the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "an immediate implication of our result above is that if @xmath1 is found to be smaller than the above value @xmath17 , then either @xmath59 symmetry has to be very badly broken or there must be contributions to symmetry breaking from the charged lepton sector .",
    "we now include the charged lepton sector and following the suggestion of ref.@xcite , consider the charged lepton mass matrix of the form @xmath60 we work in the charged lepton mass eigenstate basis . in this basis",
    ", the neutrino mass matrix can be rotated from its original mass matrix by @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath61 is defined by @xmath63 is diagonal .",
    "the charged lepton masses require @xmath64 we need @xmath65 to be relatively big to be able to generate the large mixing angle solution to the solar neutrino problem ; @xmath66 is then has to be small and we approximate it to be zero . in the charged lepton mass eigenstate basis , the neutrino mass matrix is found to be @xmath67 to this mass matrix , we must add the renormalization group corrections due to the charged lepton mass , which then induces the solar mass splitting .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , this process of rotation of the charged lepton and the renormalization group corrections lead to a nonzero value for the @xmath3 parameter correlated with the solar mixing angle , @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the correlation between these two parameters .",
    "we note that as @xmath3 reduces , the value of @xmath1 increases .",
    "for @xmath19 , we get @xmath68 .",
    "this can therefore be used to test the model .",
    "it is important to note that the solar mixing angle @xmath1 will be more precisely measured by kamland ( down to the level of @xmath69 ) if the lma solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is correct .",
    "there are many experimental projects ( such the off axis numi beam@xcite , jhf and the neutrino factory proposals ) whose main goal is to measure ( or limit ) @xmath3 down to the level of a few percent .",
    "clearly this will then very severely constrain or rule out the case where the @xmath0 symmetry is broken in the charged lepton sector .",
    "in this section , we will discuss possible theoretical origin of the mass matrices analyzed above in simple gauge models . we will first present a simple extension of the standard model by adding two additional singlet right handed neutrinos , @xmath70 assigning them @xmath59 quantum numbers of @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . denoting the standard model lepton doublets by @xmath73 ,",
    "the @xmath59 symmetry allows the following new couplings to the lagrangian of the standard model : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the higgs doublet of the standard model ; @xmath76 is the dirac charge conjugation matrix .",
    "we add to it the symmetry breaking mass terms for the right handed neutrinos , which are soft terms , i.e. @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "these terms break @xmath59 by two units but since they are dimension 3 terms , they are soft and do not induce any new terms into the theory .",
    "it is clear from the resulting mass matrix for the @xmath79 system that the linear combination @xmath80 is massless and the atmospheric oscillation angle is given by @xmath81 ; for @xmath82 , the @xmath83 is maximal .",
    "the seesaw mass matrix then takes the following form ( in the basis @xmath84 with @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 the diagonalization of this mass matrix leads to the mass matrix of the form discussed in eq .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with the constraint that @xmath87 .",
    "this has the implication that @xmath12 .",
    "one could get nonzero values for @xmath3 by further extending the model to include another heavy right handed neutrino .",
    "in this section , we consider an application of our sumrules to a four neutrino model which accomodates the lsnd results within the 3 + 1 scenario@xcite and where the mass matrix in the three active neutrino subsector obeys @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the only symmetry breaking terms in this case are due to the mixing of the active neutrinos with the sterile one .",
    "the mass matrix in this case is given by : @xmath88 such patterns are predicted by minimal quark lepton symmetric seesaw models for the sterile neutrino as discussed in @xcite . in this mass matrix @xmath89 ; the diagonalization of this mass matrix can be carried by using the seesaw technique@xcite which leads to the effective @xmath90 active neutrino submatrix of the form that now has induced @xmath0 breaking terms .",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 has new small contributions from the diagonalization ( terms of the form @xmath93 ) . in order to fit the lsnd results",
    ", we must have @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath95 , this implies that roughly @xmath96 . using this along with the sumrules of section 2",
    ", we immediately conclude that the model predicts @xmath97 ev@xmath98 , which is much too large a value .",
    "this simple version of the model is therefore in contradiction with data .",
    "if we want to fit the solar neutrino data in the context of such a model , then it would predict a maximum value for the @xmath99 transition probability at the level of @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately this is below the sensitivity of mini - boone@xcite for detecting this process .",
    "in summary , we have outlined the predictions of the assumption that the neutrino mass matrix obeys a softly broken @xmath0 symmetry either in the neutrino or in the charged lepton sector .",
    "these predictions if confirmed will constitute evidence both for an inverted mass hierarchy among neutrinos as well as for the existence of an approximate @xmath0 symmetry , a new symmetry of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it is interesting that these predictions can be tested in the current round of solar neutrino experiments such as kamland and more definitively once future neutrino projects are able to improve the limits on the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the presence or absence of such leptonic symmetries will clearly be of fundamental significance for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the authors ( rnm ) is grateful to the institute for nuclear theory at the university of washington for hospitality when part of the work was completed .",
    "he would also like to thank k. s. babu and b. kayser for discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the national science foundation grant no .",
    "phy-0099544 .",
    "note added : after this paper was posted in the archives , it was brought to our attention that the model presented in section ( iv ) of this paper was also discussed by w. grimus and l. lavoura in the paper now cited in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was also brought to our attention that mass matrices with inverted hierarchy were analyzed in @xcite .",
