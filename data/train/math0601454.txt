    "the present paper is devoted to the computation of the fundamental groups related to three infinite families of quadric arrangements .",

    "secondly , @xmath7 contributes to the study of the galois coverings @xmath8 branched along @xmath9 .",
    "many interesting surfaces have been constructed as branched galois coverings of the plane .",
    "one example is the arrangement @xmath10 ( shown in figure [ a3 ] below ) , which has galois coverings @xmath11 branched along it ; @xmath12 , or @xmath13 is either an abelian surface , a @xmath14 surface , or a quotient of the two - ball @xmath15 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , some line arrangements defined by unitary reflection groups studied in @xcite are related to @xmath10 via orbifold coverings . for example , if @xmath16 is the line arrangement given by the equation @xmath17 then the image of @xmath16 under the branched covering map @xmath18\\in { { \\mathbb p}^2}\\to[x^2:y^2:z^2]\\in{{\\mathbb p}^2}$ ] is the arrangement @xmath10 , see @xcite for details .",
    "= 3.5 cm    we use the algorithm of moishezon - teicher @xcite in order to compute the braid monodromy of each one of the arrangements .",
