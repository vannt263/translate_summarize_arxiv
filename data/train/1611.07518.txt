    "<S> in contrast to conventional double - slit interference patterns , the probability density shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pilot - wave](b , c ) originates only from the lower slit . at later times </S>",
    "<S> , the probability density still covers only values in the lower part behind the double - slit , but interference can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> similar patterns were created by zheng et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pilot - wave](b ) it looks as if the upper maximum is not connected to the others , but there is , as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pilot - wave](c ) , just a low probability to find the particle . in a de - broglie bohm interpretation </S>",
    "<S> this would mean that the particles move fast at these positions .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> i have rewritten the schrdinger equation in a way that it allows the propagation of fractions of the quantum mechanical probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the derived propagation process itself depends on the complete phase of the actual solution of the schrdinger equation .    </S>",
    "<S> i have shown that the propagation equation goes over into the guiding equation of the de - broglie bohm theory . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that results of the de - broglie bohm theory can formally agree with results of the schrdinger equation .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , i have applied the propagation equation in the case of a double - slit experiment . </S>",
    "<S> here , i used the phase of the whole double - slit wave function in order to propagate only the probability density of a particle located at the lower slit . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted in a final probability distribution which covers only positions located in the lower part of the area behind the double slit , while interference is still visible .    </S>",
    "<S> because a result like this can not be obtained by the common usage of the schrdinger equation , this example demonstrates that my reformulation of the schrdinger equation provides an additional degree of freedom to the conventional use of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> it needs to be checked if it proves helpful to resolve controversies in different interpretations of quantum mechanics . </S>"
