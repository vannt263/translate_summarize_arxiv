    "energy markets have been liberalised worldwide in the last two decades .",
    "since then we have witnessed the increasing importance of such commodity markets which organise the trade and supply of energy such as electricity , oil , gas and coal .",
    "closely related markets include also temperature and carbon markets .",
    "there is no doubt that such markets will play a vital role in the future given that the global demand for energy is constantly increasing .",
    "the main products traded on energy markets are spot prices , futures and forward contracts and options written on them .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing research interest in the question of how such energy prices can be modelled mathematically . in this paper , we will focus on modelling energy _",
    "prices , which include day - ahead as well as real - time prices .",
    "traditional spot price models typically allow for _ mean - reversion _ to reflect the fact that spot prices are determined as equilibrium prices between supply and demand .",
    "in particular , they are commonly based on a gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , see schwartz  @xcite , or more generally , on weighted sums of ou processes with different levels of mean - reversion , see , for example , benth , kallsen and meyer - brandis  @xcite and klppelberg , meyer - brandis and schmidt  @xcite . in such a modelling framework , the mean - reversion is modelled directly or physically , by claiming that the price change is ( negatively ) proportional to the current price . in this paper",
    ", we interpret the mean - reversion often found in commodity markets in a _",
    "weak sense _ meaning that prices typically concentrate around a mean - level for demand and supply reasons . in order to account for such a weak form mean - reversion , we suggest to use a modelling framework which allows to model spot prices ( after seasonal adjustment ) directly in _",
    "stationarity_. this paper proposes to use the class of volatility modulated lvy - driven volterra ( @xmath0 ) processes as the building block for energy spot price models . in particular , the subclass of so - called lvy semistationary ( @xmath1 ) processes turns out to be of high practical relevance .",
    "our main innovation lies in the fact that we propose a modelling framework for energy spot prices which ( 1 ) allows to model deseasonalised energy spot prices directly in _ stationarity _ , ( 2 ) comprises _ stochastic volatility _ , ( 3 ) accounts for the possibility of _ jumps _ and _ spikes _ , ( 4 ) features great flexibility in terms of modelling the _ autocorrelation structure _ of spot prices and of describing the so - called _ samuelson effect _ , which refers to the finding that the volatility of a forward contract typically increases towards maturity .",
    "we show that the new class of @xmath0 processes is analytically tractable , and we will give a detailed account of the theoretical properties of such processes .",
    "furthermore , we derive explicit expressions for the forward prices implied by our new spot price model .",
    "in addition , we will see that our new modelling framework encompasses many classical models such as those based on the schwartz one - factor mean - reversion model , see schwartz  @xcite , and the wider class of continuous - time autoregressive moving - average ( carma ) processes . in that sense , it can also be regarded as a unifying modelling approach for the most commonly used models for energy spot prices .",
    "however , the class of @xmath0 processes is much wider and directly allows to model the key special features of energy spot prices and , in particular , the stochastic volatility component .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the class of @xmath0 processes in section  [ sectionlss ] .",
    "next , we formulate both a geometric and an arithmetic spot price model class in section  [ sectionmodel ] and describe how our new models embed many of the traditional models used in the recent literature . in section  [ sectionforward ] , we derive the forward price dynamics of the models and consider questions like affinity of the forward price with respect to the underlying spot .",
    "section  [ emp ] contains an empirical example , where we study electricity spot prices from the european energy exchange ( eex ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sectionconclusion ] concludes , and the contains the proofs of the main results .",
    "throughout this paper , we suppose that we have given a probability space @xmath2 with a filtration @xmath3 satisfying the ` usual conditions , ' see karatzas and shreve  @xcite , definition  i.2.25 .",
    "let @xmath4 denote a cdlg lvy process with lvy ",
    "khinchine representation @xmath5 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the lvy measure @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 and @xmath13 . we denote the corresponding characteristic triplet by @xmath14 . in a next step ,",
    "we extend the definition of the lvy process to a process defined on the entire real line , by taking an independent copy of @xmath15 , which we denote by @xmath16 and we define @xmath17 for @xmath18 . throughout the paper",
    "@xmath19 denotes such a two - sided lvy process .",
    "the class of volatility modulated lvy - driven volterra ( @xmath0 ) processes , introduced by barndorff - nielsen and schmiegel  @xcite , has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant , @xmath22 is the two - sided lvy process defined above , @xmath23 are measurable deterministic functions with @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are cdlg stochastic processes which are ( throughout the paper ) assumed to be _ independent _ of @xmath22 . in addition , we assume that @xmath28 is positive .",
    "note that such a process generalises the class of convoluted subordinators defined in bender and marquardt  @xcite to allow for stochastic volatility .",
    "a very important subclass of @xmath0 processes is the new class of lvy semistationary ( @xmath1 ) processes : we choose two functions @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 whenever @xmath33 , then an @xmath1 process @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 note that the name lvy semistationary processes has been derived from the fact that the process  @xmath36 is stationary as soon as @xmath28 and @xmath37 are stationary . in the case that @xmath38 is a two - sided brownian motion , we call such processes brownian semistationary ( @xmath39 ) processes , which have recently been introduced by barndorff - nielsen and schmiegel  @xcite in the context of modelling turbulence in physics .",
    "the class of @xmath1 processes can be considered as the natural analogue for ( semi- ) stationary processes of lvy semimartingales ( @xmath40 ) , given by @xmath41    the class of @xmath0 processes can be embedded into the class of ambit fields , see barndorf - nilsen and schmiegel  @xcite , barndorff - nielsen , benth and veraart  @xcite .    also , it is possible to define @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes for _ singular _ kernel functions @xmath42 and  @xmath43 , respectively ; a function @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) defined as above is said to be singular if @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) does not exist or is not finite .      in order to simplify the exposition ,",
    "we will focus on the stochastic integral in the definition of an @xmath0 ( and of an @xmath46 ) process only .",
    "that is , throughout the rest of the paper , let @xmath47 in this paper , we use the stochastic integration concept described in basse - oconnor , graversen and pedersen  @xcite where a stochastic integration theory on @xmath48 , rather than on compact intervals as in the classical framework , is presented . throughout the paper , we assume that the filtration @xmath49 is such that @xmath22 is a lvy process with respect to @xmath49 , see basse - oconnor , graversen and pedersen  @xcite , section 4 , for details .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the lvy triplet of @xmath22 associated with a truncation function @xmath50 .",
    "according to basse - oconnor , graversen and pedersen  @xcite , corollary 4.1 , for @xmath51 the process @xmath52 with @xmath53 is integrable with respect to @xmath22 if and only if @xmath52 is @xmath49-predictable and the following conditions hold almost surely : @xmath54 when we plug in @xmath55 , we immediately obtain the corresponding integrability conditions for the @xmath1 process .",
    "[ ex1 ] in the case of a gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck process , that is , when@xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then the integrability conditions above are clearly satisfied , since we have @xmath59      for many financial applications , it is natural to restrict the attention to models where the variance is finite , and we focus therefore on lvy processes @xmath22 with finite second moment . note that the integrability conditions above do not ensure square - integrability of @xmath60 even if @xmath22 has finite second moment .",
    "but substitute the first condition in ( [ mart - int - cond ] ) with the stronger condition @xmath61 \\,\\mathrm{d}s<\\infty,\\ ] ] then @xmath62 is square integrable . clearly , @xmath63 $ ] is constant in case of stationarity . for the lebesgue integral",

    "schwarz inequality , we find @xmath65\\leq\\int _ { -\\infty}^t\\bigl|g(t , s)\\bigr|^{2a } \\,\\mathrm{d}s\\int _ { -\\infty } ^t\\bigl|g(t , s)\\bigr|^{2(1-a ) } \\mathbb{e}\\bigl [ \\omega_s^2\\bigr ] \\,\\mathrm{d}s\\ ] ] for any constant @xmath66 .",
    "thus , a sufficient condition for ( [ leb - int - l2-cond ] ) to hold is that there exists an @xmath66 such that @xmath67 \\,\\mathrm{d}s < \\infty,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which simplifies to @xmath68 \\,\\mathrm{d}s<\\infty,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath1 case . given a model for @xmath28 and @xmath43 , these conditions are simple to verify .",
    "let us consider an example .",
    "in example  [ ex1 ] , we showed that for the kernel function @xmath69 and in the case of constant volatility , the conditions ( [ mart - int - cond ] ) are satisfied . next , suppose that there is stochastic volatility , which is defined by the barndorff - nielsen and shephard  @xcite stochastic volatility model , that is @xmath70 , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and a subordinator @xmath73 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath73 has cumulant function @xmath74 for a lvy measure @xmath75 supported on the positive real axis , and that @xmath76 has finite expectation . in this case",
    ", we have that @xmath77 = \\int_0^{\\infty}z \\ell_u(\\mathrm{d}z)<\\infty$ ] for all @xmath78 .",
    "thus , both ( [ mart - int - l2-cond ] ) and ( [ leb - int - l2-cond ] ) are satisfied ( the latter can be seen after using the sufficient conditions ) , and we find that @xmath79 is a square - integrable stochastic process .",
    "this section presents the new modelling framework for energy spot prices , which is based on @xmath0 processes . as before , for ease of exposition , we will disregard the drift part in the general @xmath0 process for most of our analysis and rather use @xmath80 with @xmath81 as the building block for energy spot price , see ( [ eqsimpleambit ] ) for the precise definition of all components . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that the corresponding integrability conditions hold",
    ". we can use the @xmath0 process defined in ( [ defyspot ] ) as the building block to define both a geometric and an arithmetic model for the energy spot price .",
    "also , we need to account for trends and seasonal effects .",
    "let @xmath82 denote a bounded and measurable deterministic seasonality and trend function .    in a _",
    "geometric _ set up",
    ", we define the spot price @xmath83 by @xmath84 in such a modelling framework , the deseasonalised , logarithmic spot price is given by a @xmath0 process .",
    "alternatively , one can construct a spot price model which is of _ arithmetic _ type .",
    "in particular , we define the electricity spot price @xmath85 by @xmath86 ( note that the seasonal function @xmath87 in the geometric and the arithmetic model is typically not the same . ) for general asset price models , one usually formulates conditions which ensure that prices can only take positive values .",
    "we can easily ensure positivity of our arithmetic model by imposing that @xmath22 is a lvy subordinator and that the kernel function @xmath42 takes only positive values .",
    "we have formulated the new spot price model in the general form based on a @xmath0 process to be able to account for non - stationary effects , see , for example , burger _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , burger , graeber and schindlmayr  @xcite .",
    "if the empirical data analysis , however , supports the assumption of working under stationarity , then we will restrict ourselves to the analysis of @xmath1 processes with stationary stochastic volatility . as mentioned in the , traditional models for energy spot prices",
    "are typically based on mean - reverting stochastic processes , see , for example , schwartz  @xcite , since such a modelling framework reflects the fact that commodity spot prices are equilibrium prices determined by supply and demand .",
    "stationarity can be regarded as a weak form of mean - reversion and is often found in empirical studies on energy spot prices ; one such example will be presented in this paper .      in order to be able to have a stationary model , the lower integration bound in the definition of the @xmath0 process , and in particular for the @xmath1 process , is chosen to be @xmath88 rather than  0 .",
    "clearly , in any real application , we observe data from a starting value onwards , which is traditionally chosen as the observation at time @xmath89 .",
    "hence , while @xmath0 processes are defined on the entire real line , we only define the spot price for @xmath90 .",
    "the observed initial value of the spot price at time @xmath89 is assumed to be a _ realisation _ of the random variable @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "such a choice guarantees that the deseasonalised spot price is a stationary process , provided we are in the stationary @xmath1 framework .      since @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes are driven by a general lvy process",
    "@xmath22 , it is possible to account for price jumps and spikes , which are often observed in electricity markets . at the same time , one can also allow for brownian motion - driven models , which are very common in , for example , temperature markets , see , for example , benth , hrdle and cabrera  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of our new modelling framework which sets the model apart from many traditional models is the fact that it allows for stochastic volatility .",
    "volatility clusters are often found in energy prices , see , for example , hikspoors and jaimungal  @xcite , trolle and schwartz  @xcite , benth  @xcite , benth and vos  @xcite , koopman , ooms and carnero  @xcite , veraart and veraart  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to have a stochastic volatility component , given by @xmath28 , in the model .",
    "note that a very general model for the volatility process would be to choose an @xmath0 process , that is , @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes a deterministic , positive function and @xmath73 is a lvy subordinator . in fact , if we want to ensure that the volatility @xmath96 is stationary , we can work with a function of the form @xmath97 , for a deterministic , positive function @xmath98 .      the kernel function @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) plays a vital role in our model and introduces a flexibility which many traditional models lack : we will see in section  [ secevarcov ] that the kernel function  together with the autocorrelation function of the stochastic volatility process  determines the autocorrelation function of the process @xmath99 .",
    "hence our @xmath0  based models are able to produce various types of autocorrelation functions depending on the choice of the kernel function @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to stress here that this can be achieved by using _",
    "one _ @xmath0 process only , whereas some traditional models need to introduce a multi - factor structure to obtain a comparable modelling flexibility . also due to the flexibility in the choice of the kernel function",
    ", we can achieve greater flexibility in modelling the shape of the samuelson effect often observed in forward prices , including the hyperbolic one suggested by bjerksund , rasmussen and stensland  @xcite as a reasonable volatility feature in power markets .",
    "note that we obtain the modelling flexibility in terms of the general kernel function @xmath42 here since we specify our model directly through a stochastic integral whereas most of the traditional models are specified through evolutionary equations , which limit the choices of kernel functions associated with solutions to such equations . in that context , we note that a @xmath0 or an @xmath1 process can not in general be written in form of a stochastic differential equation ( due to the non - semimartingale character of the process ) . in section  [ sectsmcond ] , we will discuss sufficient conditions which ensure that an @xmath1 process is a semimartingale .",
    "as already mentioned above , energy spot prices are typically modelled in stationarity , hence the class of @xmath1 processes is particularly relevant for applications . in the following",
    ", we will show that many of the traditional spot price models can be embedded into our @xmath1 process - based framework .",
    "our new framework nests the stationary version of the classical one - factor schwartz  @xcite model studied for oil prices . by letting @xmath22",
    "be a lvy process with the pure - jump part given as a compound poisson process , cartea and figueroa  @xcite successfully fitted the schwartz model to electricity spot prices in the uk market .",
    "benth and altyt .",
    "e benth  @xcite used a normal inverse gaussian lvy process @xmath22 to model uk spot gas and brent crude oil spot prices .",
    "another example which is nested by the class of @xmath1 processes is a model studied in benth  @xcite in the context of gas markets , where the deseasonalised logarithmic spot price dynamics is assumed to follow a one - factor schwartz process with stochastic volatility .",
    "a more general class of models which is nested is the class of so - called carma - processes , which has been successfully used in temperature modelling and weather derivatives pricing , see benth , altyt .",
    "e benth and koekebakker  @xcite , benth , hrdle and lpez cabrera  @xcite and hrdle and lpez cabrera  @xcite , and more recently for electricity prices by garca , klppelberg and mller  @xcite , benth _ et al .",

    "@xcite , it is shown that if all the eigenvalues of @xmath116 have negative real parts , then @xmath117 defined as @xmath118 is the ( strictly ) stationary solution of ( [ multi - ou - carma ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath119 is a @xmath120 process .",
    "hence , specifying @xmath121 in ( [ carma ] ) , the log - spot price dynamics will be an @xmath1 process , but without stochastic volatility .",
    "garca , klppelberg and mller  @xcite argue for @xmath122 dynamics as an appropriate class of models for the deseasonalised log - spot price at the singapore new electricity market .",
    "the innovation process @xmath22 is chosen to be in the class of stable processes . from benth ,",
    "e benth and koekebakker  @xcite , brownian motion - driven @xmath123 models seem appropriate for modelling daily average temperatures , and are applied for temperature derivatives pricing , including forward price dynamics of various contracts .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of wind speeds have been modelled by a brownian motion - driven @xmath124 model , and applied to wind derivatives pricing , see benth and altyt .",
    "e benth  @xcite for more details .    finally note that the arithmetic model based on a superposition of @xmath1 processes nests the non - gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck model which has recently been proposed for modelling electricity spot prices , see benth , kallsen and meyer - brandis  @xcite .",
    "we emphasis again that , beyond the fact that @xmath1 processes can be regarded as a unifying modelling approach which nest many of the existing spot price models , they also open up for entirely _ new _ model specifications , including more general choices of the kernel function ( resulting in non - linear models ) and the presence of stochastic volatility .",

    "hence , when dealing with , for example , electricity spot prices , this assumption is not valid since electricity is essentially non - storable .",
    "hence , such a spot price can not be part of any financial portfolio and , therefore , the requirement of being a martingale under some equivalent measure @xmath163 is not necessary .",
    "guasoni , rsonyi and schachermayer  @xcite have pointed out that , while in frictionless markets martingale measures play a key role , this is not the case any more in the presence of market imperfections .",
    "in fact , in markets with transaction costs , _ consistent price systems _ as introduced in schachermayer  @xcite are essential . in such a set - up ,",
    "even processes which are not semimartingales can ensure that we have _ no free lunch with vanishing risk _ in the sense of delbaen and schachermayer  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if a continuous price process has _",
    "conditional full support _",
    ", then it admits consistent price systems for arbitrarily small transaction costs , see guasoni , r ' asonyi and schachermayer  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown by pakkanen  @xcite , that under certain conditions , a @xmath39 process has conditional full support .",
    "this means that such processes can be used in financial applications without necessarily giving rise to arbitrage opportunities .",
    "let us briefly point out some model extensions concerning a multi - factor structure , non - stationary effects , multivariate models and alternative methods for incorporating stochastic volatility .",
    "a straightforward extension of our model is to study a superposition of @xmath1 processes for the spot price dynamics .",
    "that is , we could replace the process @xmath36 by a superposition of @xmath164 factors : @xmath165 and where all @xmath166 are defined as in ( [ defyspot ] ) for independent lvy processes @xmath167 and independent stochastic volatility processes @xmath168 , in both the geometric and the arithmetic model .",
    "such models include the benth , kallsen and meyer - brandis  @xcite model as a special case .",
    "a superposition of factors @xmath169 opens up for separate modelling of spikes and other effects .",
    "for instance , one could let the first factor account for the spikes , using a lvy process with big jumps at low frequency , while the function @xmath43 forces the jumps back at a high speed .",
    "the next factor(s ) could model the `` normal '' variations of the market , where one observes a slower force of mean - reversion , and high frequent brownian - like noise , see veraart and veraart  @xcite for extensions along these lines .",
    "note that all the results we derive in this paper based on the one factor model can be easily generalised to accommodate for the multi - factor framework .",
    "it should be noted that this type of `` superposition '' is quite different from the concept behind supou processes as studied in , for example , barndorff - nielsen and stelzer  @xcite .    in order to study various energy spot prices simultaneously",
    ", one can consider extensions to a multivariate framework along the lines of barndorff - nielsen and stelzer  @xcite , veraart and veraart  @xcite .",
    "in addition , another interesting aspect which we leave for future research is the question of alternative ways of introducing stochastic volatility in @xmath0 processes .",
    "so far , we have introduced stochastic volatility by considering a stochastic proportional of the driving lvy process , that is , we work with a stochastic integral of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "an alternative model specification could be based on a stochastic time change @xmath170 , where @xmath171 .",
    "such models can be constructed in a fashion similar to that of volatility modulated non - gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck processes introduced in barndorff - nielsen and veraart  @xcite .",
    "we know that outside the brownian or stable lvy framework , stochastic proportional and stochastic time change are not equivalent .",
    "whereas in the first case the jump size is modulated by a volatility term , in the latter case the speed of the process is changed randomly .",
    "these two concepts are in fact fundamentally different ( except for the special cases pointed out above ) and , hence , it will be worth investigating whether a combination of stochastic proportional and stochastic time change might be useful in certain applications .",
    "in this subsection , we are concerned with the calculation of the forward price @xmath172 at time @xmath6 for contracts maturing at time @xmath173 .",
    "we denote by @xmath174 a finite time horizon for the forward market , meaning that all contracts of interest mature _ before _ this date .",
    "note that in energy markets , the corresponding commodity typically gets delivered over a delivery period rather than at a fixed point in time .",
    "extensions to such a framework can be dealt with using standard methods , see , for example , benth , altyt benth and koekebakker  @xcite for more details .",
    "let @xmath175 denote the spot price , being either of geometric or arithmetic kind as defined in ( [ eqgambit - spot ] ) and ( [ eqaambit - spot ] ) , respectively , with @xmath176 where the stochastic volatility @xmath28 is chosen as previously defined in ( [ eqambitsv ] ) .",
    "clearly , the corresponding results for @xmath1 processes can be obtained by choosing .",

    ", one usually uses equivalent martingale measures @xmath163 , meaning that the equivalent probability measure @xmath163 should turn the discounted price dynamics of the underlying asset into a ( local ) @xmath163-martingale .",
    "however , as we have already discussed , this restriction is not relevant in , for example , electricity markets since the spot is not tradeable .",
    "thus , we may choose any equivalent probability @xmath163 as pricing measure . in practice",
    ", however , one restricts to a parametric class of equivalent probability measures , and the standard choice seems to be given by the esscher transform , see benth , altyt benth and koekebakker  @xcite , shiryaev  @xcite .",

    "<S> this paper introduces the class of _ volatility modulated lvy - driven volterra _ ( @xmath0 ) processes and their important subclass of _ lvy semistationary _ ( @xmath1 ) processes as a new framework for modelling energy spot prices . </S>",
    "<S> the main modelling idea consists of four principles : first , deseasonalised spot prices can be modelled directly in stationarity . </S>",
    "<S> second , stochastic volatility is regarded as a key factor for modelling energy spot prices . </S>",
    "<S> third , the model allows for the possibility of jumps and extreme spikes and , lastly , it features great flexibility in terms of modelling the autocorrelation structure and the samuelson effect . we provide a detailed analysis of the probabilistic properties of @xmath0 processes and show how they can capture many stylised facts of energy markets . </S>",
    "<S> further , we derive forward prices based on our new spot price models and discuss option pricing . </S>",
    "<S> an empirical example based on electricity spot prices from the european energy exchange confirms the practical relevance of our new modelling framework .    , </S>"
