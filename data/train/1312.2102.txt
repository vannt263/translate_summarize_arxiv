    "for a nearly integrable systems @xmath7    kam theory assures that the set of kam tori occupies a rather large - measured part in phase space , but it s still a topologically sparse set .",
    "it indicates that for a system with a freedom not bigger than two degrees , every orbit will be confined in the ` cells ' formed by energy surface and kam tori , and the oscillations of action variables do not exceed a quantity of order @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this disproved the ergodic hypothesis formulated by maxwell and boltzmann : + * for a typical hamiltonian on a typical energy surface , all but a set of zero measure of initial conditions , have trajectories covering densely this energy surface itself . *",
    "+ however , if the number of degrees of freedom @xmath9 greater than two , the n - dimensional invariant tori can not divide each ( 2n-1)-dimensional energy surface into disconnected parts and the action variables of trajectories not laying on the tori are unrestrained .",
    "so it s reasonable to modify the ergodic hypothesis and raise :    [ q h ] for a typical hamiltonian on a typical energy surface , there exists at least one dense trajectory .",
    "the first progress towards this direction is made by v. arnold @xcite in 1964 . in his paper",
    ", he constructed a 2.5 degrees of freedom system which has an unperturbed normally hypobolic invariant cylinder ( nhic ) and a ` homoclinic overlap ' structure .",
    "this ` homoclinic overlap ' structure assures the existence of heteroclinic trajectories towards different lower - dimensional tori located in the nhic , and along these heteroclinic trajectories the slow action variable of shadowing orbits changes of @xmath10 in a rather long time .",
    "we can simplify this mechanism and raise the following :    [ a d ] typical integrable hamiltonian systems with n degrees of freedom @xmath11 is topologically instable : through an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any point there passes a phase trajectory whose slow variables drift away from the initial value by a quantity of order @xmath10 .",
    "celebrated progress has been made through the past twenty years and we can give a quite positive answer to this conjecture [ a d ] . for results of _ a priori _ unstable case , the readers can see @xcite and @xcite of _ a priori _ stable case .",
    "but a definite answer whether conjecture [ q h ] is right or wrong is still far from the reach of modern dynamical theory .",
    "+ one instinctive idea towards quasi - ergodic hypothesis is to use the same method in solving conjecture [ a d ] to construct trajectories to fill the topologically open - dense complement of kam tori .",
    "so to find asymptotic trajectories of kam tori is the first difficulty we must overcome .",
    "the first exploration was made by r. duady@xcite :    for a fixed diophantine rotation vector @xmath3 , there exists a nearly integrable system @xmath12 which is @xmath13-approached to an integrable system @xmath14 , such that for any open neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath4 , there exists one trajectory @xmath16 of system @xmath17 entering @xmath18 from the place @xmath10 far from @xmath4 .    from this theorem , we could deduce that kam torus is of lyapunov instability .",
    "but as @xmath19 , @xmath16 is different from each other .",
    "so his construction is invalid to find asymptotic orbits of kam torus .",
    "+ we can generalize arnold s construction of @xcite to a certain type of nearly integrable systems , which is known by _ a priori _ unstable ones .",
    "this condition actually assures that the existence of nhic ( normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder ) with considerable length .",
    "based on the celebrated theory developed by j. mather , @xcite and @xcite first found the generic existence of diffusion orbits in this case from the variational view .",
    "more generalized nearly integrable systems are called _ a priori _ stable systems .",
    "we will face new difficulties in solving this case comparing to _ a priori _ unstable one : +    1 .",
    "non - existence of long - length nhic .",
    "complicated resonance - relationship divides the 1-resonance lines into short segments , so we ca nt just use the overlap mechanism to find @xmath10 diffusion orbits .",
    "+ 2 .   coming out of 2-resonance .",
    "nhics corresponding to different 1-resonance segments are separated by the chaotic layer caused by 2-resonance .",
    "we need to find trajectories in this layer to connect them ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    since diophatine vector @xmath20 is non - resonant , we have to overcome these two difficulties in finding asympytotic orbits .",
    "the first announcement of _ a priori _ stable case was given by j. mather in 2003 .",
    "he defined a conception ` cusp residue ' to measure the ` size ' of a set in topological space .",
    "later , c - q .",
    "cheng verified the cusp genericity of diffusion orbits in _ a priori _ stable case . in @xcite , he proposed a plan to overcome the difficulties caused by 2-resonance : + * around the lowest flat @xmath21 there exists an incomplete intersection annulus @xmath22 whose width we could precisely calculate and the ma set @xmath23 ranges as a broken lamination structure , @xmath24 . besides , the cohomology classes corresponding to nhics could plug into @xmath25 .",
    "* + based on this idea , we can connect different nhics in this annulus @xmath25 with mather s mechanism diffusion orbits discovered in @xcite .",
    "these orbits can be connected with the arnold mechanism diffusion orbits of nhics and we succeed to construct @xmath10 diffusion orbits in _ a priori _ stable case . + from now on we only consider the case of @xmath26degrees of freedom .",
    "as a special case of _ a priori _ stable systems , finding asymptotic trajectories of kam torus will face another new difficulty : infinitely many changes of 1-resonance lines will be involved in . here",
    "we can give a rough explanation on this .",
    "from @xcite we know that the ` cusp genericity ' is caused by the restrictions of hyperbolic strength on different 1-resonant lines .",
    "since @xmath27 is non - resonant , it s unavoidable to face infinitely many 1-resonant lines .",
    "these lines cause infinite times ` cusp remove ' to the perturbed function space @xmath28 on the contrary .",
    "so we only have a ` porous ' set @xmath29 left , of which we have the chance to find asymptotic trajectories . recall that this set @xmath30 is not open in @xmath28 !    [ main1 ] for nearly integrable systems written by @xmath31 here @xmath2 is strictly convex , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is strictly positively definite . for a fixed diophantine vector @xmath34",
    ", we could find @xmath35 such that for @xmath36 and @xmath37 with self - similar and weak - coupled structures , of which we can find asymptotic trajectories of kam torus @xmath4 .    here",
    "the self - similar and weak - coupled structures are proposed to the fourier coefficients of @xmath38 . to avoid the collapse of infinitely many times cusp - remove",
    ", we should control the speed of decline of hyperbolicity along the resonance lines tend to @xmath27 , and then the fourier coefficients are involved in .",
    "later we will see that the fourier coefficients corresponding to different resonant lines are independent from each other .",
    "we could benefit from this and raise a self - similar structure to simplify our treatment of infinite resonance relationships to finite ones .    for a system of a form ( [ 2 ] ) , we can ensure the persistence of @xmath4 as long as @xmath39 is sufficiently small . then the following holds :    @xcite[change ] there exists a smooth exact symplectic transformation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a small neighborhood of @xmath42 . for @xmath36 and under this transformation , we can convert hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) to @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a quadratic polynomial with @xmath45 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is strictly positively definite",
    ".    it s a direct cite of lemma ( 6.1 ) in @xcite for details .",
    "moreover , we can use finite steps of ` birkhoff normal form ' transformations to raise the order of polynomial and get    [ robust ] there exists another smooth exact symplectic transformation @xmath46 under which system ( [ 3 ] ) can be changed into @xmath47 with a sufficiently large @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    in the above theorem",
    "we omit the small number @xmath50 which assures the existence of kam torus @xmath4 , since we can restrict diam@xmath51 much smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "we just need to find asymptotic trajectories in this domain . from now on ,",
    "we will write @xmath52 as @xmath53 for short without confusion",
    ".    based on theorem [ change ] and lemma [ robust ] , we could convert theorem [ main1 ] into the following    * ( main result)*[main2 ] for the system of a form ( [ 4 ] ) , we can find proper @xmath54 with a self - similar and weak - coupled structure of which there exists at least one asymptotic trajectory to the kam torus @xmath4 .",
    "at last , we sketch out our plan : to find the proper @xmath55 , we need a list of ` rigid ' conditions to be satisfied . owing to these conditions",
    ", we can give a ` skeleton ' of @xmath55 which is not easy to be destroyed .",
    "then we use ` soft ' generic perturbations to construct diffusion orbits which finally tends to @xmath4 . here , ` soft ' means the perturbations can be chosen arbitrarily small and arbitrarily smooth , which is known from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . + from the proof the readers can see that the frame we made in order to get the asymptotic orbits is ` firm ' enough and small perturbations ca nt destroy it .",
    "our method is neither the same with the way v. kaloshin and m. saprykina used in @xcite , nor the same with the way p. calvez and r. douady used in @xcite(in their papers they considered some close problems with ours ) .",
    "our new approach benefits us with the chance to find more systems satisfying our demand .",
    "+ we also recall that other two papers related with our result : one is @xcite in 2010 and the other is @xcite in 2004 .",
    "the latter one considered the asymptotic trajectories of resonant elliptic points , which is different from our situation and only finitely many resonant lines are involved in .",
    "+ this paper is our first step to find preciser diffusion orbits in general systems .",
    "there s still a long way to go for the target of giving a rigorous answer to the quasi - ergodic hypothesis , and it s still open to find alternative mechanisms to construct diffusion orbits .",
    "interestingly , t. tao found an example of cubic defoucusing nonlinear schrdinger equation of which energy transports to higher frequencies in @xcite .",
    "his construction shares some similarities with arnold diffusion .",
    "moreover , a self - similar resonant structure with special arithmetic properties is also applied in his construction .",
    "aware of these , we are confident that it must be a hopeful direction to apply our diffusion mechanisms to pde problems . recently , m. guardia and v. kaloshin have made some progress in this domain@xcite .",
    "we just need to prove theorem [ main2 ] which is a special form of theorem [ main1 ] via a @xmath13 symplectic transformation .",
    "as we can see , system ( [ 4 ] ) is a tonelli hamiltonian , of which @xmath56 is actually unperturbed .",
    "we could find a skeleton of infinitely many resonant lines @xmath57 in the frequency space , along which @xmath58 approaches to diophantine vector @xmath27 as @xmath59 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we could divide this skeleton into * 1-resonant lines , transitional segments from 1-resonance to 2-resonance and 2-resonant points * according to different resonant relationships .",
    "each of them we need different mechanisms to deal with . +     +    for the former two cases , to supply the nhics with enough hyperbolicity",
    ", we need several ` rigid ' conditions * u2,3 * for the fourier coefficients of @xmath55 corresponding to the current resonant line @xmath58 of considerations . for the 2-resonant case @xmath60 , a ` weak - coupled ' structure can be available by properly choosing the mixed fourier coefficients according to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this simplifies the dynamic behaviors of 2-resonance greatly .",
    "also several ` rigid ' conditions * u@xmath63 * are needed in this case to generate an incomplete intersection annulus with certain width and to persist the bottom parts of crumpled nhics .",
    "+ notice that there exist extra 2-resonant points inside @xmath58 , which we call * sub 2-resonant * points .",
    "since there is nt any transition between different resonant lines at these points , our diffusion orbits just need to cross them and go on along the nhics according to 1-resonant lines . to achieve this , rigid condition * u3 * is needed .",
    "+ recalls that infinitely many resonant relationships are considered in our case , so these ` rigid ' conditions have to be uniformly satisfied according to all of these resonant lines .",
    "that s why we mark the ` rigid ' conditions with a letter ` u ' .",
    "it s the cost to avoid the collapse caused by infinite times cusp remove .",
    "but the self - similar structure simplifies the complexity and gives us a universal treatment for all the resonant relationships .",
    "+ now we explain why these ` rigid ' conditions can be satisfied without conflict and give a sketch of the construction .",
    "we begin with such a tonelli hamiltonian : @xmath64    @xmath65 first , we choose a proper resonant plan @xmath66 which approximate @xmath27 steadily .",
    "+ @xmath65 second , along these resonant lines , we can transform system ( [ 5 ] ) to a resonant normal form @xmath67 with finite kam iterations in a neighborhood of @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69_{\\omega^*}$ ] is the average term corresponding to the current frequency @xmath70 .",
    "all these conditions and structural demands can all be satisfied by @xmath71 as long as the @xmath72 sequence of fourier coefficients @xmath73 are properly chosen , where @xmath74 subspace of @xmath72 .",
    "we can see that different resonant lines will decide different subspaces of @xmath72 which are independent from each other .",
    "this point is very important for our case .",
    "+ @xmath65 third , at the 2-resonance @xmath60 , we need to connect different nhics of their bottoms .",
    "a weak - coupled structure can be available by the mixed terms of fourier coefficients according to @xmath60 .",
    "this structure does nt damage the hyperbolicity of nhics and are strong enough to supply us a chaotic layer with sufficient width , which we called * incomplete intersection annulus * here .",
    "in this part we mainly used the same method proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ it s remarkable that this ` weak - coupled ' structure reduces the complexity of dynamical behaviors greatly at the 2-resonant domain , which can be considered as an application of melnikov s approach .",
    "we take @xcite for a convenient reference .",
    "+ @xmath65 at last , since all the ` rigid ' conditions have been satisfied , we can perturb system ( [ 5 ] ) step by step to find diffusion trajectories which extend towards to @xmath4 gradually .",
    "based on the matured methods of genericity and regularity developed by @xcite and @xcite , the perturbation functions are very ` soft ' , i.e. they can be made arbitrarily small and smooth .",
    "here we use a list of perturbations @xmath75 to modify system ( [ 5 ] ) and get a system of a form ( [ 4 ] ) , for which we indeed get an asymptotic trajectory of @xmath4 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the rest part of this section",
    "we will give a sketch of the mather theory and fathi s weak - kam method , also several properties about global elementary weak - kam solutions in the finitely covering space@xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we give a resonant plan @xmath66 to approximate @xmath27 and get its fine properties .",
    "section 3 supplies a stable normal form with finite kam iterations which is unified for all the @xmath76 . in this part",

    ", we prove the existence of nhics in every case separately , 1-resonance , transitional segments from 1-resonance to 2-resonance and then 2-resonance . in the later two cases ,",
    "a homogenized method is involved . in the 2-resonance case ,",
    "a weak - coupled structure is used and we could give a precise estimate about the lowest positions where the bottoms of nhics could persist . besides , we get the conclusion that aubry sets just locate on these nhics . in section 5 ,",
