    "the diffusion is called anomalous if the mean squared displacement of the brownian particle does not rise with time linearly , as it is the case for the usual brownian motion , but slower ( subdiffusion ) or faster ( superdiffusion ) .",
    "there are many examples of physical systems which exhibit such anomalous transport ; they involve complex systems , disordered systems , semiconductors , polymers , glasses , turbulent plasma , and many others ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "physical situations in which the deviation of the linear dependence is expected comprise : a porous and inhomogeneous environment with traps and barriers , a coupling to a fractal heat bath via a random matrix interaction @xcite , long - range and/or long - time correlations .",
    "also the transport phenomena in dynamical hamiltonian systems often exhibit anomalous behaviour because the corresponding phase space can contain some regular structures which act as dynamical traps @xcite .",
    "a trajectory sticks to such self - similar hierarchy of islands in chaotic environment and abide on regular paths for a long time .",
    "the emergence of the anomalous diffusion means that the traditional approach , involving the standard fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) with the diffusion constant , is no longer valid .",
    "usually , the anomalous diffusion is attributed to memory effects , which are especially pronounced in non - markovian descriptions , e.g. by means of the generalized langevin equation @xcite and the continuous - time random walk models ( ctrw ) @xcite . in the diffusive limit ,",
    "those approaches resolve themselves to the fractional equations formalism @xcite which contain the riemann - liouville operator as the fractional time - derivative ; the step - size distribution is the gaussian . as a direct consequence of the nonlocality in time and , therefore , of the lack of markovian property , the uncoupled ctrw predicts subdiffusive solutions in this case @xcite .",
    "however , the anomalous behaviour is possible also for the markovian processes ; they are described by fpe with the position - dependent diffusion term and physically can correspond e.g. to the diffusion on fractal objects @xcite or to the langevin equation with the multiplicative noise @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss another example of such markovian process .",
    "a more general approach considers the lvy distribution which is defined , in its symmetric version , via the characteristic function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . if @xmath2 the second moment is infinite and the generalized central limit theorem must be applied .",
    "physically , lvy processes can reflect self - similarity : they are the stable solutions of the renormalization group method and are invariant under the scaling of position and time .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian distribution , they include large fluctuations .",
    "the lvy distributions are present in many problems connected with various branches of since , including not only physics but also biology , economy , financial market research , etc .",
    "the diffusion equation for the lvy process involves a fractional derivative over the process value @xcite and for @xmath3 it resolves itself to the ordinary fpe .",
    "since the variance diverges for @xmath4 and the traditional description of the diffusion process is no longer valid , one has to introduce new concepts , e.g. to study fractional moments @xcite or to restrict the integration in averaging to a finite box which scales with time in a prescribed way @xcite .",
    "problems related to generalized diffusion equations , which contain either anomalous behaviour of the variance or infinite fluctuations , are the subject of the present paper .",
    "we deal with a jumping process which is markovian , defined in terms of a jump - size distribution @xmath5 and the waiting time distribution @xmath6 .",
    "a peculiarity of the distribution @xmath6 consists in a position - dependent jumping rate .",
    "the process is defined in sec.ii . in sec.iii",
    "we derive the fpe as a small step limit of the master equation .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to the fractional diffusion equation which is an approximation of the master equation in the diffusion limit for @xmath7 given by the lvy distribution ; we solve this equation , discuss its diffusion properties and compare with numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "the results of our analysis are discussed in sec.v .",
    "the jumping process we are to deal with in this paper is a stepwise constant stochastic process @xmath8 defined in terms of two probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the waiting time density distribution determines the time intervals @xmath9 between consecutive jumps and it is assumed in the poissonian form : @xmath10 where the jumping rate @xmath11 depends on the process value ( the position ) .",
    "the size of the jumps is determined by a given normalized distribution @xmath12 . then the infinitesimal transition probability can be easily constructed and the master equation derived .",
    "it is of the form @xmath13    because of the variable jumping rate @xmath11 , the above process can be regarded as a version the kangaroo process @xcite .",
    "the difference consists in the jump - size dependence of @xmath7  in the kangaroo process @xmath7 depends only on the current position . due to that property , the eq.([fpkp ] ) can describe transport phenomena @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the process constitutes a special case of the coupled ctrw .",
    "taking into account the position dependence of jumping rate is an important generalization of traditional random walk approaches .",
    "such dependence is expected in many phenomena in which inhomogeneity of the environment can not be neglected @xcite .    the stationary solution of eq.([fpkp ] ) can be easily obtained : @xmath14 .",
    "the normalization condition imposes restrictions on the function @xmath11 : it must rise sufficiently fast in the infinity and sufficiently slow near zero . if , in turn , @xmath15 has poles at some @xmath16 , the stationary solution also exists and it is in the form of a combination of the delta functions . in the other cases",
    "@xmath17 does not exist .",
    "a special version of the stationary process , defined on the circle , exhibits long - time correlations and can serve as a model of the @xmath18 noise @xcite .",
    "the general , time - dependent solution of the eq.([fpkp ] ) can be obtained by using the laplace transforms .",

    ", we yield the following result : @xmath23 the simple case @xmath24const can be solved completely and the eq.([var ] ) predicts the normal diffusion . however , if @xmath25 does not vanish , the diffusion becomes ballistic @xcite . for @xmath7 with divergent second moment , in turn , @xmath26 is infinite .",
    "the expression ( [ pwarl ] ) is difficult to handle and one has to resort to approximations . in the limit of small jumps ,",
    "the process becomes continuous both in space and time and fpe may be a candidate for such approximation . in order to construct it ,",
    "we apply the kramers - moyal expansion @xcite of the master equation . in that method ,",
    "one changes the integration variable in the eq.([fpkp ] ) by introducing the step size @xmath27 and , after the expansion of the function @xmath28 around @xmath29 , one obtains the master equation in a form of the following series @xmath30\\ ] ] which is still exact .",
    "the approximation consists in neglecting all terms of the order higher than two .",
    "obviously , all moments of @xmath7 must be finite .",
    "finally , we obtain the fpe : @xmath31}{\\partial x^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",

    "takes the form of the ordinary diffusion equation which describes the wiener process and is characterized by the normal diffusion .",
    "an interesting case is the power - law form of the jumping frequency : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant parameter and @xmath37 ensures proper units ; in the following we assume @xmath38 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient in the form ( [ nux ] ) has been used to describe the diffusion on fractal objects @xcite , the transport of fast electrons in a hot plasma @xcite , turbulent two - particle diffusion @xcite .",
    "the fpe with that diffusion coefficient has been analyzed from the point of view of the first passage time in ref .",
    "the fpe ( [ rfp ] ) with @xmath39 given by eq.([nux ] ) can be solved exactly @xcite : @xmath40 where latexmath:[$c_{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{2 \\gamma(\\frac{1+\\theta}{2+\\theta } ) }    @xmath36 must be excluded . since for @xmath42 the eq.([fpkp ] ) has the stationary solution ( in the form of the delta function ) , the approximation by the fpe is not valid ; the diffusion in this case is local .",
    "moreover , for @xmath43 the distribution ( [ rozw ] ) is not normalized .",
    "therefore , we have either @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",

    "the agreement is good already for @xmath47 .",
    "the diffusion properties of the system follow directly from the solution ( [ rozw ] ) .",

    "in fact , the lvy distribution in its most general form can be expressed as a fox function @xcite . that formalism is useful in describing stable processes because it reflects scaling properties of the underlying phenomena . the definition and some properties of the fox functions",
    "are presented in appendix .",

    "@xmath86 identically because the gamma function in the denominator is infinite .",
    "similarly , for the function @xmath19 we have : @xmath87 where we imposed the condition @xmath88 to get the exponent @xmath69 for the term @xmath70 .",
