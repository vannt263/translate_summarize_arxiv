    "it is well known that a shock wave in a compressible fluid is characterized by a steep jump in gas velocity , density , and temperature across which there is a dissipation of energy due fundamentally to collisions of particles .",
    "the aim of this article is to present experimental and numerical evidence of a different type of shock wave which is generated in a quantum fluid that is a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in this case , the shock front is dominated not by dissipation but rather dispersion . viewed locally , these dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) with large amplitude oscillations and two associated speeds bear little resemblance to their classical , dissipative counterparts .",
    "however , we demonstrate that a direct comparison is possible when one considers a mean field theory , corresponding to the _ average _ of a dsw .    since extensive theoretical work has been done in the field of compressible gas dynamics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is important to relate this work to the `` dispersive gas dynamics '' which bec embodies .",
    "the present work contrasts and compares dissipative and dispersive shock waves through multidimensional numerical simulation and analytical studies .",
    "we also provide an explanation of what a bec shock wave is in the context of the well understood concept of a classical shock wave in gas dynamics .",
    "early experiments studying shock - induced dynamics in bec were reported in @xcite where a slow - light technique was used to produce a sharp density depression in a bec .",
    "direct experimental imaging of bec blast waves has been performed in the rotating context and numerical solutions of the governing gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation were used to describe the wave dynamics @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the zero dissipation limit of classical gas dynamics as applied to bec was discussed in @xcite where it was shown that a shock wave could develop .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite the shock wave in the small dispersion limit of the one dimensional repulsive gp equation was analyzed using the whitham averaging method and the attractive gp equation was analyzed in @xcite .    in the present paper , for the first time a comparison between dissipative and dispersive shock waves",
    "is carried out through a careful investigation of new experiments and theory in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section [ sec : non - dimens - gross ] we give the relevant dynamical equation , i.e. the gp equation , and we put it in non - dimensional form and give the associated conservation laws . in section [ sec : experiment ] we present new experimental results depicting `` blast '' waves in a non - rotating bec . in section [ sec : numerical - results ] we show that direct three dimensional numerical simulations , with radial symmetry using the gp equation give excellent agreement with these experiments . in section [ sec : class - disp - shock ]",
    "an analysis of dissipative and dispersive shock waves in two types of one - dimensional systems , the inviscid burgers equation and the euler equations , is provided .",
    "two types of limiting behavior for conservation laws , the _ dissipative regularization _ ( small dissipation limit ) and _ dispersive regularization _ ( small dispersion limit ) are considered .",
    "we then present numerical evidence showing that the three dimensional and two dimensional calculations agree extremely well ( less than one percent relative difference ) .",
    "it is also found that the one dimensional approximation of the 3d blast wave experiments is in good qualitative agreement .",
    "using one dimensional theory , we explain why the experimentally observed blast waves may be viewed as dsws .",
    "an analogy between the classical equations of fluid flow , the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations , and the density , phase equations for the wave function ( order parameter ) associated with a bec is well known @xcite . the crucial difference from ns is a dispersive term that replaces the dissipative term in classical fluid dynamics .",
    "the gp equation models the mean - field dynamics of the bec wave function @xmath0 and has been shown to be an effective approximation in many situations .",
    "experiments in rapidly rotating becs have provided evidence of dynamics similar to what is often considered to be `` blast waves '' .",
    "moreover , simulations with the gross - pitaevskii equation were compared with experiment giving support to the validity of the gp equation in such extreme circumstances @xcite .",
    "the dimensional gp equation is @xcite @xmath1 with conservation of particle number @xmath2 the coefficient of nonlinearity , @xmath3 , is characterized by the inter - particle scattering length @xmath4 ( here positive representing repulsive particles ) and the number of condensed atoms @xmath5 ; the other parameters are the atomic mass of the species considered ( @xmath6 ) and planck s constant divided by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the standard confining harmonic potential ( trap ) is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the radial and axial trap frequencies respectively .",
    "a convenient normalization for our purposes is to take @xcite @xmath12 after dropping primes , equation becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 with the normalization of the wavefunction ( [ eq:16 ] ) preserved and the trap potential @xmath15 the coefficient @xmath16 represents the asymmetry in the harmonic trap . in the experiments considered , the parameters are : @xmath17 particles , @xmath18 nm and @xmath19 kg for the species @xmath20 , @xmath21 hz , and @xmath22 .",
    "this normalization shows that the dispersion is extremely small , @xmath23 .",
    "conservation of `` mass '' and `` momentum '' for the gp equation are , @xmath24 since it will be useful for later discussions , we give the local conservation laws in the 1d case ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath25      ( \\rho u)_t + \\left ( \\rho u^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2 } \\rho^2 \\right)_x      & = \\frac{{\\varepsilon}^2}{4 } ( \\rho ( \\log \\rho)_{xx } ) _ x - \\rho v_x ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where subscripts denote differentiation .",
    "the condensate `` density '' @xmath26 and `` velocity '' @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28    equations give an alternative formulation of the gp equation in terms of `` fluid - like '' variables . since the @xmath29 term is obtained from the linear dispersive term in eq .",
    ", we call this the dispersive term .",
    "the navier - stokes equations for a 1d compressible gas with density @xmath26 and velocity @xmath27 can be written @xcite @xmath30      ( \\rho u)_t + \\left ( \\rho u^2 + p \\right)_x      & = { \\varepsilon}^2",
    "u_{xx } + \\rho f ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the pressure and @xmath32 is an external force per unit mass .",
    "the positive coefficient @xmath29 represents dissipative effects due to viscous shear and heat transfer . if the pressure law @xmath33 is assumed ( for example , a perfect , isentropic gas with adiabatic constant @xmath34 or , equivalently , the shallow water equations for height @xmath26 and velocity @xmath27 ) , then the ns equations correspond to the gp conservation equations when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "equations for the case @xmath35 and @xmath37 are called the euler equations . to compare different types of shock waves , we are interested in the dispersive regularization ( @xmath38 in ) as compared to the dissipative regularization ( @xmath39 in ) of the euler equations ( @xmath40 ) .    a remark regarding the form of the above equations .",
    "many authors use the velocity form @xmath41      u_t + \\left ( \\tfrac{1}{2 } u^2 + \\rho \\right)_x & = \\frac{{\\varepsilon}^2}{4        \\rho } ( \\rho ( \\log \\rho)_{xx } ) _ x - v_x ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] of equation by implicitly assuming differentiability and that @xmath42 . as we will be interested in",
    "_ weak _ , hence not everywhere smooth , solutions to the dissipative regularization of the euler equations , it is necessary to maintain the form of the conservation laws as derived directly from the original integral formulation .",
    "it is well known that weak solutions to different forms of the same conservation law can be quite different .",
    "one must also be careful when dealing with the vacuum state @xmath43 as in classical gas dynamics .",
    "the momentum equation ( [ eq:19 ] ) takes both of these issues into account .",
    "in order to investigate the fundamental nature of shock waves in a quantum fluid , we have performed new experiments that involve blast pulses in becs .",
    "in contrast to the experiments described in @xcite , the experiments analyzed in this work are all done with non - rotating condensates . we have succeeded in directly imaging dispersive shock waves in these systems , and the particular geometry of these experiments makes them amenable to the theoretical analysis presented in this paper .    condensates consisting of approximately 3.5 million rb atoms were prepared in an axisymmetric trap with trapping frequencies of @xmath44 hz ; @xmath10 is the radial frequency and @xmath11 is the axial frequency .",
    "after the condensate was formed , a short , tightly focused laser beam was pulsed along the @xmath45-axis through the center of the bec .",
    "the wavelength of the laser was 660 nm , which is far red - detuned from the rb transitions .",
    "the pulse rapidly pushes atoms from the center of the bec radially outward , leading to the formation of a density ring . before imaging ,",
    "an anti - trapping technique was used to enlarge the features of the blast wave . in brief , a rapid expansion of the bec is created by changing the internal state of the atoms such that they are radially expelled by the strong magnetic fields forming the trap .",
    "details about the anti - trapped expansion are described in @xcite .",
    "while the anti - trapped expansion changes the scale of the features involved , it does not alter the qualitative appearance of the shock phenomena , as is confirmed by our numerical simulations .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented new experimental evidence for dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) in a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "numerical simulations of the experiments and comparisons with lower dimensional approximations show that the experimentally observed ripples correspond to dsws .",
    "a dsw has two associated speeds ( front and rear of the oscillatory region ) and large amplitude oscillatory structure .",
    "a detailed comparison between classical , dissipative shock waves and dispersive shock waves has been undertaken in this work . on a large scale ,",
    "a dsw has some similarities to a dissipative shock , but there are fundamental and critical differences . using the notions of averaging and weak limits , we have shown that a dsw has one behavior similar to that of a classical shock  i.e .",
    "it has a steep front .",
    "however , the key difference between a dsw and a dissipative shock is in the shock speed and its structure .",
    "these properties are compared using dissipative and dispersive regularizations of conservation laws .",
    "a dispersive regularization for conservation laws gives rise to a _ weak _ limit in the sense that one must appropriately average over the high frequency oscillations across a dsw .",
    "on the other hand , a dissipative regularization for conservation laws is a strong limit which , in the case of a classical shock wave , converges to a discontinuity propagating with a speed that satisfies the well known jump conditions ."
