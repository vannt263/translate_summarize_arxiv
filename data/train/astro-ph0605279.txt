    "it has been known for many years that galaxies in denser environments are in general redder and brighter ( e.g. @xcite ) and are more likely to be early - type galaxies showing little signs of recent star formation than those in less dense environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent galaxy surveys have shown that the density at which the observed properties of galaxies change from those of the field to those of more dense environments is @xmath10 virial radii in clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that the galaxy density at these radii is equivalent to that of the density in poor galaxy groups ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the proposed mechanisms to transform the properties of galaxies are , therefore , environmentally dependent .",
    "the processes acting on galaxies in the group environment are different to those acting in the cluster environment : ram pressure stripping ( e.g. @xcite ) and harassment @xcite are more likely to be dominant in the dense , but rare , environments of clusters .",
    "however , mergers and strangulation are more likely in the group environment , where the velocity dispersion of the group is similar to that of its constituent galaxies @xcite and galaxies are predicted to be falling into a dense environment from the field for the first time .    due to the small numbers of galaxies in an individual group and their wide spatial distribution compared to a cluster ,",
    "groups are a relatively understudied environment .",
    "however , galaxy groups are significantly more abundant than galaxy clusters and most galaxies in the local universe are found in group , rather than cluster , environments ( e.g. @xcite ) . considering the importance of this environment it is vital that this is remedied .",
    "it is therefore important to study the properties of groups and their constituent galaxies .",
    "multi - wavelength observations are vital to determine which evolutionary processes are dominant in this environment .",
    "while optical spectra and near - infrared imaging provide dynamical information on the groups and morphologies of individual galaxies , x - ray observations provide information on the mass and dynamical state of the group and neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations show us regions of potential star formation , and provide direct evidence of interactions through tidal material .",
    "the group evolution multiwavelength study ( gems ; @xcite ) is an on - going study of 60 groups with a range of optical and x - ray properties .",
    "the group selection is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in addition to calculating the x - ray luminosity of each group , which is proportional to the gas density in the potential and hence mass , @xcite also determine whether the groups have intra - group x - ray emission , x - ray emission solely from a galaxy halo or , if the x - ray flux was @xmath11 above the background level , defined the group as undetected .",
    "wide - field neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations of 16 gems groups in the southern hemisphere were made with the parkes radiotelescope ( kilborn et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite defined the optical properties of the gems groups within a radius corresponding to an overdensity of 500 times the critical density  @xmath12 .",
    "galaxies were obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) within @xmath12 .",
    "the optical data were used to calculate the mean velocity , @xmath13 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , of the groups and the updated values were used to refine the search criteria . the selection and recalculation",
    "were repeated until the values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 were stable .",
    "the dynamical properties of the groups were then calculated for the galaxies within @xmath12 .",
    "in some cases there was only 1 galaxy member within @xmath12 preventing a measurement of dynamical properties .",
    "here we re - analyse the optical properties of the 16 groups with hi observations using a ` friends - of - friends ' percolation algorithm ( fof ; @xcite ) to determine group membership .",
    "we then compare the groups optical properties with their x - ray properties .",
    "the hi properties of these groups will be analysed in kilborn et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    unlike @xcite where galaxies are defined as group members",
    "if they are within a specific radius and velocity range of each centroid , fof determines which galaxies are associated with one another in position and velocity space and does not rely on any _ a priori _ assumption about the geometrical shape of groups .",
    "we use the 6-degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; @xcite ) to obtain galaxy velocities for this sample of 16 groups and emphasize that every galaxy in our analysis has measured recession velocities , freeing our statistical analyses from projection effects and providing a significant advantage over some previous studies .",
    "we examine the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) near - infrared magnitudes and colours of the constituent galaxies .",
    "these magnitudes provide an advantage over the @xmath14-band magnitudes used by @xcite as the light from the near - infrared is more closely related to galaxy mass .",
    "we also stack galaxies in the groups to create a composite group with galaxy numbers comparable to those in a cluster , in order to better understand the properties of the groups .",
    "the dynamical properties of two of these groups , ngc 1332 and ngc 1407 were discussed in @xcite .",
    "those results are updated and the remaining 14 groups presented and discussed in this paper . the group properties and x - ray attributes of the groups derived by @xcite are given in table  [ osmond_groups ]  g indicates groups with intra - group x - ray emission ( i.e. x - ray extent @xmath15 kpc ) , h indicates groups with only galaxy - halo emission ( i.e. emission @xmath16 kpc ) and u indicates that the x - ray flux from that region was @xmath11 above the background level and the group is therefore undetected in x - rays .",
    "eight of the groups in this sample show x - ray emission , 6 show solely galaxy - halo emission and 2 are undetected in x - rays .",
    "the ngc 3783 , ngc 7144 and ngc 7714 groups had less than 4 members within @xmath12 in @xcite and do not appear in their final statistical analysis .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we introduce our data in section  [ data_sect ] and in section  [ members_sect ] we discuss our method of determining group membership using these data .",
    "the dynamical properties of the groups based on that membership are presented in section  [ dynamics_sect ] and the properties of the individual groups are discussed in section  [ indiv_sect ] .",
    "the relations between the x - ray and dynamical properties of the groups are presented in section  [ scaling_sect ] and the properties of the brightest group galaxies in section  [ section_bggs ] .",
    "our analysis of the galaxies in each group stacked to create a composite group is presented in section  [ composite_sect ] and we draw our conclusions in section  [ concl_sect ] . as in previous gems papers we assume @xmath17 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",

    "<S> here we present an investigation of the properties of 16 nearby galaxy groups and their constituent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the groups are selected from the group evolution multi - wavelength study ( gems ) and all have x - ray as well as wide - field neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> group membership is determined using a friends - of - friends algorithm on the positions and velocities from the 6-degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) and nasa / ipac extra - galactic database ( ned ) . for each group </S>",
    "<S> we derive their physical properties using this membership , including : velocity dispersions ( @xmath0 ) , virial masses ( @xmath1 ) , total k - band luminosities ( @xmath2 ) and early - type fractions ( @xmath3 ) and present these data for the individual groups . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gems x - ray luminosity is proportional to the group velocity dispersions and virial masses : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , consistent with the predictions of self - similarity between group and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that @xmath6 , i.e. mass grows faster than light and that the fraction of early - type galaxies in the groups is correlated with the group x - ray luminosities and velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the brightest group galaxies ( bggs ) , finding that , while the luminosity of the bgg correlates with its total group luminosity , the fraction of group luminosity contained in the bgg decreases with increasing total group luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that bggs grow by mergers at early times in group evolution while the group continues to grow by accreting infalling galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we form a composite galaxy group in order to examine the properties of the constituent galaxies and compare their properties with those of field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there are clear radial trends , with group galaxies becoming fainter , bluer and morphologically later types with increasing radius from the group centre , reaching field levels at radii @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the composite group by group x - ray luminosity and find that galaxies in high x - ray luminosity groups ( log@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ) are redder with a higher giant - to - dwarf ratio and are more likely to be early - type galaxies than are those galaxies in low x - ray luminosity groups . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that harrassment and ram pressure stripping processes are unlikely to cause these differences . </S>",
    "<S> the differences are more likely to be due to galaxy - galaxy mergers and possibly some further mechanism such as strangulation . </S>",
    "<S> if mergers are the dominant mechanism then the properties of galaxies in the higher x - ray luminosity groups are a result of mergers at earlier epochs in smaller mass groups that have since merged to become the structures we observe today , while lower x - ray luminosity groups are still undergoing mergers today .    </S>",
