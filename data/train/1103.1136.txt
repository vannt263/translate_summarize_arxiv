    "the noon state , an @xmath0-particle fock state with two modes maximally entangled , has attracted many interests since it has the potential to enhance the measurement precision by employing quantum entanglement @xcite . attributed to the property of superresolution and supersensitivity , the noon state has been experimentally realized in various photonic systems @xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of noon state - the atomic spin wave ( sw ) noon state - was proposed , and a heralded second - order sw noon state as well , was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the scheme @xcite employs raman transitions to generate the atom - photon entanglement and the sw noon state is created in a herald way by detecting the photons .",
    "the sw noon state can be used as an atomic sw interferometer and can in principle be implemented in a scalable way . however , owing to the probabilistic nature , this sw interferometer works in a very low efficiency and thus can not be put into practical measurement .    in recent years , the ryberg atom draw extensive concern in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it has large size and can exhibit large electric dipole moment .",
    "this property introduces strong interactions between two rydberg atoms .",
    "consequently , in a small volume , when an atom is excited to the rydberg state @xmath1 , the energy level of state @xmath1 for other atoms will be shifted by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the probability for other atoms being excited to @xmath1 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath3 . in the limit @xmath4 , only one atom is excited to @xmath1 .",
    "this is the so - called rydberg blockade mechanism .",
    "the rydberg blockade has been proposed to deterministically implement quantum computer and quantum repeater @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an efficient way to implement the sw interferometer by deterministically generating the sw noon state with rydberg blockade .",
    "an elaborate error analysis shows that the @xmath5th - order sw noon state can be generated with @xmath6 fidelity under realistic parameters , and accordingly a high fidelity sw interferometer with @xmath7 can be realized .",
    "this rydberg - based sw interferometer is much more efficient than the one based on photon detection and might be used as an inertial sensor , for measuring position and displacement , or further , for measuring acceleration and platform rotation .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii describes an envisioned setup and presents the scheme to generate and measure the sw noon state .",
    "error analysis in practical implementations is given in sec .",
    "experimental realization is suggested in sec .",
    "iv , and finally we conclude in sec .  v.",
    "we envision a setup as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) . an ensemble of @xmath8 atoms",
    "is confined in a volume @xmath9 , where the blockade mechanism is effective . in other words ,",
    "the scale of @xmath9 is smaller than the blockade radius .",
    "the working atomic energy levels are chosen to be of the double-@xmath10 type , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) .",
    "they are labeled as the ground state @xmath11 , the rydberg state @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the metastable state @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the atoms are coupled by four types of classic light pulses propagating along two spatial modes @xmath16 , whose wave vectors are denoted as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "they will also be used to denote the corresponding light pulses if no ambiguity arises .",
    "these light pulses couple @xmath21 and @xmath12 , @xmath12 and @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 , and @xmath23 and @xmath15 respectively , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) .    before giving the detailed scheme",
    ", we shall first introduce some definitions .",
    "we define a collective ground state @xmath24 , a collective operator @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xmath27 to describe a collective state with wave vector @xmath28 , @xmath29 namely , state @xmath26 is a coherent superposition of states which have a specific atom at @xmath30 with the position - dependent phase under the wave vector @xmath28 .",
    "the same applies to the higher - order collective state @xmath31 , with @xmath32 a positive integer . on this basis ,",
    "a @xmath32th - order sw noon state can be written as @xmath33     an ensemble of n atoms trapped in volume v. the atoms are coupled by four types of light pulses , propagating along two spatial modes @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath34 the double-@xmath10 type energy levels",

    "( 1 ) , the atom number is exactly known , i.e. , @xmath36 ; ( 2 ) , the rydberg blockade mechanism is perfect , i.e. , @xmath37 ; ( 3 ) , the lifetime of the rydberg state is infinite and thus no spontaneous decay occurs ; ( 4 ) , the atomic cloud remains still during the whole process . on this basis",
    ", our scheme to generate a @xmath38th - order sw noon state can be described as    1 .",
    "prepare an ensemble at the ground state @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   apply sequentially a collective @xmath40 pulse @xmath41 and a single - atomic @xmath42 pulse @xmath43 .",
    "the former flips one of the @xmath0 atoms from @xmath44 to the rydberg state @xmath45 and the latter flips @xmath45 to the equal superposition of the first - order sw state @xmath46 and @xmath45 , where @xmath47 @xmath48 .",

    "repeatedly apply a sequence of four collective @xmath40 pulses @xmath41 , @xmath52 , @xmath50 , @xmath43 for @xmath54 times , and one obtains @xmath55 6 .",
    "apply a collective @xmath56 pulse to flip the atom from @xmath57 and take into account the normalized factor , and one obtains a @xmath32th - order sw noon state latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle_{\\ell}=(|\\bm{\\ell},\\bm{k}_{gr_{a}s_{a}}\\rangle_{s_{a}}+     according to the above procedure , the generation of a @xmath32th - order sw noon state needs totally @xmath59 light pulses , the number of which is linear to @xmath38 .",
    "note that one needs two @xmath56 pulses @xmath41 and @xmath43 to produce a first - order sw state @xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , two @xmath38th - order sw states @xmath61 and @xmath62 would consume @xmath63 light pulses . the @xmath32th - order sw noon state is the superposition of two @xmath32th - order sw states at the @xmath64 and @xmath65 modes .",
    "thus , we consider the above protocol close to being optimal , albeit the possibility of further improvement is not entirely excluded .",
    "here we demonstrate how the sw noon state can be utilized as an atomic interferometer .",
    "let s assume that , after the @xmath32th - order sw noon state is prepared , the atomic cloud moves to a new position with a displacement @xmath66 . to measure @xmath66 , we apply a sequence of operations reverse to the generation procedure , until the last operation , i.e. , the collective @xmath40 pulse @xmath41 .",
    "detailed calculations show that we obtain the superposition state @xmath67 where @xmath68 . note that , by applying an ionizing electric field , the rydberg state @xmath69 will be ionized and a free electron will fly out of the atomic ensemble .",
    "thus , the state  ( [ eq_final ] ) can be measured onto the @xmath69 basis , and the average result will reflect the phase shift @xmath70 . since the wave vectors of the light pulses are known , this gives the displacement @xmath71 .",
    "the phase shift is proportional to the order @xmath32 , and thus the larger @xmath32 would bring @xmath66 the better precision .",
    "in actual implementations , errors can always occur .",
    "for instance , the precise number @xmath0 of atoms in the ensemble is normally unknown , and the atom number @xmath0 also varies for different experimental trials .",
    "this leads to an uncertainty @xmath72 of the atom number , which is @xmath73 for large @xmath0 .",
    "since the collective rabi frequency @xmath74 of the @xmath40 pulse @xmath75 @xcite is related to the atom number @xmath0 as @xmath76 , @xmath72 would induce an imprecision in @xmath74 as @xmath77 .",
    "this means that , when a collective @xmath40 pulse @xmath75 is applied to flip one of the atoms from @xmath39 to @xmath78 , there exists a probability @xmath79 that the flip fails . to generate a @xmath32th - order sw noon state",
    ", the total error introduced by @xmath72 is about @xmath80 . in lab",
    ", one can prepare an ensemble of @xmath81 atoms , and thus the error is about @xmath82 for order @xmath83 .    aside from the error induced by the uncertainty of the atom number , the imperfect blockade mechanism and the finite lifetime of the rydberg state also introduces errors . attributed to these factors , each operation in our scheme is implemented with a non - unity probability .",
    "we step by step analyze all the operations from step @xmath84 to step @xmath85 , and find that , these non - unity probabilities can be categorized into five types , denoted as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the generated @xmath32th - order sw noon state should be rewritten approximately as @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "symbol @xmath93 stands for the order of the sw state during the generation process , and it increases from @xmath84 to @xmath32 as one produces the @xmath32th - order sw noon state .",

    "( the error induced by the uncertainty of atom number is not included in @xmath96 . ) before evaluating @xmath96 , we shall first analyze the origins of these probabilities .",
    "the probability @xmath86 is introduced by the imperfect blockade that occurs between the atoms of the same mode when the pulse @xmath75 flips one of the atoms from @xmath44 to @xmath78 . in other words",
    ", there is an error that two atoms are excited to the rydberg state @xmath97 due to the non - infinite energy shift .",

    "symbol @xmath103 is the effective finite energy shift , and @xmath104 are the corresponding two collective rabi frequencies , which have been assumed to be real . since the amplitudes for the states of more than two atoms being excited are significantly suppressed due to the rydberg blockade , we have neglected them here and in the following . besides",
    ", we have assumed the number of atoms @xmath105 and the coupling light pulses are all in resonance .",
    "the initial condition describing this mechanics is @xmath106 . after applying the collective @xmath40 pulse @xmath75 with the operation time @xmath107",
    ", one can express the probability for generating @xmath100 from @xmath44 , as @xmath108 .",
    "the probability @xmath87 characterizes the imperfect blockade that takes place between the atoms of the different modes during @xmath109 .",
    "that is to say , there is an error that the pulse @xmath75 would flip one of the atoms from @xmath44 to @xmath100 when another atom has already been excited to @xmath110 .",
    "accordingly , this mechanics is governed by the following equations , @xmath111 the initial condition describing this mechanics is @xmath112 , and one can express the probability for holding the atoms at the ground state , as @xmath113 .    the probability @xmath114 is contributed by the decay rate of the rydberg state . the finite lifetime will inevitably cause some loss when the atom is still at the rydberg state during @xmath109 , thus the probability for the atom remaining at the rydberg state is @xmath115 .",
    "these three types ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath114 ) are all determined by a shared rabi frequency @xmath116 or a shared operation time @xmath109 . note that there is tradeoff between the imperfect rydberg blockade and the loss caused by the decay , and a simple argument",
    "is that if we enhance the the magnitude of the rabi frequency to shorten the operation time , which reduces the loss from the rydberg state , it will be associated with more errors from the imperfect blockade .",

    "the origin of @xmath90 is similar to @xmath114 , it reflects the probability that the atom remains at the rydberg state during @xmath128 , and thus @xmath129 .",
    "the value of @xmath130 is determined by a shared rabi frequency @xmath131 or a shared operation time @xmath128 .",
    "likewise , one can calculate the maximal value of @xmath130 by numerically solving eqs .",
    "( [ e6]-[e8 ] ) with @xmath93 from @xmath84 to @xmath32 .    to evaluate @xmath96",

    "accordingly , eq.([eq_p2 ] ) can be calculated in a numerical way .",
    "we obtain the error @xmath96 versus the energy shift @xmath103 , shown in fig.[figure2 ] .     versus the energy shift @xmath103 under various order @xmath32 after generating the sw noon state . the solid data and the open one respectively denote the lifetime of the rydberg state with @xmath137 @xmath138 and @xmath139 @xmath138.,width=321 ]    from the figure , we see that the larger the energy shift , the smaller the error , and the error vanishes as @xmath103 tends to infinity .",

    "an intrinsic limitation originates from the average distance of two rydberg atoms , which should be larger than the radius of each rydberg atom . in the limit of high density where the rydberg atoms remarkably overlap ,",
    "our blockade model is inappropriate , and a more elaborate mechanism should be taken into account .",
    "this mechanism goes beyond the extent of our paper and will not be discussed .",
    "besides , as one readily expects , the figure shows that the error is suppressed as the lifetime of the rydberg state becomes longer , and is intensified when the order @xmath32 of the sw noon state increases .",

    "enables the energy shift @xmath151 @xmath136 , which ensures the error @xmath152 , as illustrated in fig.[figure2 ] . in a volume of @xmath153 , a density of @xmath154 @xmath155 allows @xmath81 atoms in an ensemble . based on these estimated parameters above",
    ", we suggest to employ the one - dimensional optical lattice as the experimental setup , where the size of the ensemble can be controlled by tuning the angle between the trapping light fields @xcite .",
    "finally , we should point out that , to detect the displacement of atomic cloud by the interferometer , the reverse operations to those in the generation procedure should be considered , and thus the total error is doubled .",
    "fortunately , the field ionization can be implemented with near - unity detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "therefore , taking into account the error induced by the uncertainty of atom number , our proposed atomic sw interferometer with a high precision ( @xmath83 ) can reach a high fidelity as @xmath156 .",
