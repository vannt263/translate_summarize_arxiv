    "we study strong solutions of the obstacle - type problem : @xmath0 where we look for @xmath1 ( we use einstein summation notation throughout the paper . ) a strong solution to a second order partial differential equation is a twice weakly differentiable function which satisfies the equation almost everywhere .",
    "( see chapter 9 of @xcite . )",
    "we will assume that the matrix @xmath2 is symmetric and strictly and uniformly elliptic , i.e. @xmath3 or , in coordinates : @xmath4 our motivations for studying this type of problem are primarily theoretical , although as observed in @xcite the mathematical modeling of numerous physical and engineering phenomena can lead to elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients .",
    "the best specific example of which we are aware for a motivation to study nondivergence form equations with discontinuous coefficients is the problem of determining the optimal stopping time in probability .",
    "although we do not want ( or even need ) any further assumptions for many of our results about the regularity of solutions to our obstacle problem , it turns out that the question of existence of solutions will require us to assume some regularity of our @xmath5 in fact , there is an important example due to c. pucci ( found in @xcite ) which shows that the strict uniform ellipticity of the @xmath6 ( i.e. equation (  [ eq : uniformellip ] ) ) is in general not even enough to guarantee the existence of a solution to the corresponding partial differential equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the space of vanishing mean oscillation ( vmo ) turns out to be a suitable setting for existence results and a priori estimates as was shown in papers by chiarenza , frasca , and longo ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and it will also turn out to be an appropriate setting for getting some initial results about the regularity of the free boundary . ( without using the language of vmo , caffarelli proved very similar results in @xcite . to compare these results , chapter 7 of @xcite and remark 2.3 of @xcite are very helpful . )",
    "it is worth noting that there are results due to meyers which require a little bit less smoothness of the coefficients if one is content to work in @xmath7 spaces with @xmath8 close to @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) , but in this case , one can not use the sobolev embedding to get continuity of a first derivative except in dimension two . in any case",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath10 belong to vmo when proving existence , and again when we turn to study the regularity of the free boundary .",
    "it is also worth noting that elliptic and parabolic equations in both divergence and nondivergence form with coefficients in vmo have received a fair amount of attention lately from krylov and his coauthors .",
    "( see in particular @xcite and @xcite and the references therein . )",
    "after we prove a key lemma for compactness and a corollary which leads us to nontrivial blowup limits we establish the following theorem ( see theorem (  [ cams ] ) in this paper ) which is modeled after caffarelli s main results in @xcite :    we assume that @xmath11 satisfies equation (  [ eq : basicprob ] ) , we assume that @xmath12 and satisfy equation (  [ eq : uniformellip ] ) , and finally we assume that @xmath13 under these hypotheses , for any @xmath14 there exists an @xmath15 and a @xmath16 such that if there exists a @xmath17 such that @xmath18 then for all @xmath19 we have @xmath20 the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 depend on @xmath23 and on the @xmath24 but they do _ not _ depend on the function @xmath25    on the other hand , in the final section of the paper we show that the vmo assumption is not , by itself , enough to ensure uniqueness of blowup limits at free boundary points .",
    "indeed , the final theorem states :    there exists @xmath26 which satisfies equation (  [ eq : uniformellip ] ) with @xmath27 and @xmath28 there exists a nonnegative solution @xmath29 to equation (  [ eq : basicprob ] ) with this matrix @xmath24 and there exists @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath22 is a rotation , and where the limits have the same convergence as in theorem (  [ ebl ] ) ( and where as usual we let @xmath33 ) .",
    "we turn to an outline of how the paper is laid out .",
    "we start by giving definitions and background .",
    "next , after showing the existence of nontrivial solutions when the @xmath10 belong to vmo , we turn to some of the basic questions in the introductory theory of the obstacle problem .",
    "namely , we follow caffarelli s treatment ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and show nondegeneracy and optimal regularity of the solutions .",
    "once we have these tools , we turn to a study of the free boundary regularity and some of our main results .",
    "we start with a technical lemma which gives us a compactness property of solutions to the obstacle problems that we are studying . in spite of numerous hypotheses , we use this lemma twice in fundamental ways .",
    "the first time , we use it to show a measure stability property of our solutions .",
    "namely , if our matrix of coefficients @xmath10 is sufficiently close to the identity matrix , then the solution to our nondivergence form problem will have a zero set which is very close ( in lebesgue measure ) to the zero set of the solution to a new obstacle problem with the same boundary data , but where we replace our general nondivergence form operator with the laplacian .",
    "the second time we use our compactness lemma , we prove that if our @xmath10 belong to vmo and our solution has @xmath34 in its free boundary , then we can find a sequence of quadratic rescalings : @xmath35 which converge to a solution of an obstacle problem with constant coefficients on all of @xmath36 these results in turn are then used to first show a measure theoretic version of caffarelli s alternative and second they are used in a construction of a solution with two different blow up limits at the origin .",
    "our measure theoretic caffarelli alternative is the first theorem that we stated above , and it shows that at every point of the free boundary the density of the zero set will be well defined and will be either @xmath34 or @xmath37 indeed , just as in the obstacle problem for the laplacian , the so - called `` regular points '' ( which for us are the points where the density of the zero set is @xmath38 ) form an open subset of the free boundary . on the other hand , in the final section , since the averages of vmo functions do not need to converge , by rescaling along different radii where the limits of the averages converge to different numbers , we show the existence of the counter - example described in the second theorem stated above .",
    "we will use the following basic notation throughout the paper : @xmath39 for sobolev spaces and hlder  spaces , we will follow the conventions found within gilbarg and trudinger s book . in particular for @xmath40 will denote the banach space of functions which are @xmath41 times weakly differentiable , and whose derivatives of order @xmath41 and below belong to @xmath42 and for @xmath43 will denote the banach space of functions which are @xmath41 times differentiable on @xmath44 and whose @xmath45 derivatives are uniformly @xmath46-hlder  continuous .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . )",
    "when we are studying free boundary regularity , we will frequently assume + @xmath47 for convenience .",
    "we will make use of the following terminology .",
    "we define : @xmath48 we will omit the dependence on @xmath11 when it is clear .",
    "note also that `` @xmath49 '' and `` @xmath50 '' each have double duty and it is necessary to interpret them based on their context .",
    "we use `` @xmath49 '' for both the zero set and for one of the constants of ellipticity , and we use `` @xmath50 '' for the both the laplacian of a function and for the symmetric difference of two sets in @xmath36 ( if @xmath51 then @xmath52 )    we will also be using the bmo and the vmo spaces frequently , and we gather the relevent definitions here .",
