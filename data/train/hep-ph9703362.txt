    "majorana particles are natural representations of massive neutrinos since the most general mass term for a four component fermion field describes two majorana particles with different masses .",
    "majorana neutrinos also appear in many extensions of the minimal standard model ; this is the case , for example , in so(10 ) grand unified theories  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos in general , and in particular majorana neutrinos , can be used to probe the core of some of the most interesting cosmological objects . due to their small cross sections",
    "these particles can stream out unaffected from even the most violent environments such as those present in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the presence of several neutrino flavors and spin states modifies this picture : in their trek from their source to the detector the neutrinos can undergo flavor and/or spin transitions which can obscure some of the features of the source . because of this , and due to the recent interest in neutrino astronomy ( e.g. amanda , nestor , baikal , etc .",
    "@xcite ) , it becomes important to understand the manner in which these flavor - spin transitions can occur , in the hope of disentangling these effects from the ones produced by the properties of the source .",
    "without such an understanding it will be impossible to determine the properties of the agn core using solely the neutrino flux received on earth .    in a previous publication  @xcite we considered the effects of the agn environment on the neutrino flux under the assumption that all neutrinos were of the dirac type . in this complementary publication",
    "we will consider the case of majorana neutrinos and provide a deeper phenomenological study of this system , concentrating on the dependence of the effects on the magnitude of the neutrino magnetic moment and on the energy dependence of the predicted neutrino fluxes .",
    "the evolution of majorana neutrinos in agn is influenced both by its gravitational and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the latter are due to the coupling with the magnetic field through a transition magnetic moment  .",
    "the combination of these effects leads to @xmath2 or @xmath3 transitions . for simplicity we will deal with two neutrino species only ,",
    "the extensions to three ( or more ) species is straightforward ( though the analysis can become considerably more complicated  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief description of neutrino production and gravitational oscillation in agn environment in section 2 .",
    "this is followed by a calculation of transition and survival probabilities of oscillating neutrinos and the resulting flux modifications ( sections 3 and 4 ) . in section 5 we give our conclusions .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most luminous objects in the universe , their luminosities ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ergs@xmath6sec .",
    "they are believed to be powered by a central supermassive black hole whose masses are of the order of @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "high energy neutrino production in an agn environment can be described using the so - called spherical accretion model  @xcite from which we can estimate the matter density and also the magnetic field ( both of which are needed to study the evolution of the neutrino system ) .",
    "neutrino production in this model occurs via the @xmath9 decay chain  @xcite with the pions being produced through the collision of fast protons ( accelerated through first - order diffusive fermi mechanism at the shock  @xcite ) and the photons of the dense ambient radiation field .",
    "these neutrinos are expected to dominate the neutrino sky at energies of 1 tev and beyond  @xcite .    within this model",
    "the order of magnitude of the matter density @xmath10 for typical cases can be estimated at @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic field , for reasonable parameters , is of the order of @xmath12 g  @xcite .    in order to determine the effective interactions of the majorana neutrinos in an agn environment we start , following  @xcite , from the dirac equation in curved space including their weak and electromagnetic interactions   @xmath13 \\p = 0 ,   \\label{aaaa}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the tetrads , @xmath15 the usual gamma matrices",

    "we used greek indices ( @xmath22 ) to denote space - time directions , and latin indices ( @xmath23 ) to denote directions in a local lorentzian frame .",
    "the method of extracting the effective neutrino hamiltonian from ( [ aaaa ] ) is studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore provide only a brief description of the procedure for completeness .",
    "the first step of the semiclassical approximation is to consider a classical geodesic @xmath24 parameterized by an affine parameter @xmath25 . along this curve",
    "we construct three vector fields @xmath26 such that @xmath27 satisfies the geodesic differential equation to first order in the @xmath28 .",
    "we then use @xmath29 as our coordinates ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "next we consider the classical action as a function of the coordinates which satisfies the relation @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the classical momentum ) , and define a spinor @xmath32 via the usual semiclassical relation @xmath33    in our calculations it proves convenient to define a time - like vector @xmath34 corresponding to the component of momentum @xmath31 orthogonal to the @xmath35 @xmath36 it can be shown that @xmath37 are constants  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the length - scale of the metric , so that , for example , @xmath39 ; and let @xmath40 be the order of magnitude of the momentum of the neutrinos .",
    "we then make a double expansion of @xmath41 , first in powers of @xmath42 and then in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "we substitute these expressions into the dirac equation and demand that each term vanish separately .",
    "it is then possible to reduce the resulting equations to a schrdinger - like equation involving only @xmath41 which reads @xmath44 where , @xmath45 ( the over - bar indicates that the quantities are evaluated on the geodesic : @xmath46 ) .",
    "( [ schr ] ) determines the evolution of the 8-component ( for two flavors ) spinor @xmath32 .",
    "we are interested , however only in the 4-components representing the spinors with positive momenta  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ those directed from the source to the observer ) . projecting @xmath47 into this 4-dimensional subspace yields the effective hamiltonian @xmath48 for the states of interest @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the magnetic field and the effective current @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 in terms of the weak - interaction current @xmath53 and the  gravitational current \" @xmath54 where @xmath55 the term @xmath56 in ( [ heff ] ) is flavor and spin diagonal and can be eliminated by redefining the overall phase of @xmath32 with no observable consequences .",
    "the evolution of majorana neutrinos through matter in the presence of strong gravitational fields incorporating magnetic effects is thus , @xmath57 where @xmath25 is the affine parameter  .",

    "it is worth noting that , in contrast to the dirac case , antineutrinos exhibit matter interactions .",
    "this hamiltonian includes gravitational as well as electroweak effects ; the latter have been studied previously ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in our calculations we will use the kerr metric to allow for the possibility of rotation of the central agn black hole ( we also have assumed that the accreting matter generates a small perturbation of the gravitational field ) .",
    "the metric for a kerr black hole contains two parameters , @xmath69 , the horizon radius and @xmath70 the total angular momentum of the black hole per unit mass .",
    "the geodesics in this gravitational field have three constants of the motion , commonly denoted by @xmath59 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the first corresponds to the energy , the second to the angular momentum along the black - hole rotation axis ; the third constant @xmath72 has no direct interpretation , but is associated with the total angular momentum  @xcite .    using the agn models mentioned above we can compare the weak interaction current @xmath73 , to @xmath74 , its gravitational counterpart .",
