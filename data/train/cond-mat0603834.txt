    "in recent years it has been recognized that the precise ion distribution next to charged macromolecules is a key problem for understanding biological processes such as cell signaling , membrane fusion or dna replication and is also of fundamental relevance in many industrial applications .",
    "ample theoretical and experimental effort , reviewed in @xcite , have been devoted to the problem .",
    "the standard theoretical approach for describing ions in solution next to charged interfaces is the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory .",
    "pb theory , however , ignores correlations , which are believed to play a fundamental role when the interfaces are strongly charged and the solution contains multi - valent ions .",
    "a new strong coupling ( sc ) regime , defined by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a typical counterion separation near the interface and @xmath2 is the gouy - chapman length , has been identified , and different sc theories have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these theoretical descriptions usually assume that the charge at the interface is smeared to a uniform density , whereas realistic interfaces consist of discrete charges .",
    "theoretical models incorporating the discreteness of interfacial charges have been introduced recently , both within sc @xcite and pb @xcite .    rather surprisingly",
    ", there are many experimental examples that show that pb theory combined with a langmuir adsorption theory ( lpb ) @xcite , where ion adsorption to the interface is empirically included by binding - constants , adequately describes divalent ion distributions , both near membranes@xcite and langmuir monolayers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that divalent ion distributions near fatty acid charged langmuir monolayers ( @xmath3 ) are described by lpb with a striking accuracy @xcite .",
    "this result is somewhat unexpected , as it seems inescapable that tightly bound divalent ions to the interface are laterally correlated , which should result in an additional contribution to the lpb free energy ( the madelung energy ) which is given by ( @xcite and references therein ) @xmath4 where @xmath5  is the bjerrum length and @xmath6  is the lattice constant of a fatty acid in the crystalline phase . as shown below ( see fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] ) , when the madelung contribution eq .",
    "[ madelung ] is accounted for within lpb , the agreement between theory and experiment is completely ruined . in this letter , we consider _ transverse _ ( as opposed to _ lateral _ ) correlations ( see fig .  [ f.0 ] ) between the counterions and the discrete interfacial charges and show that they induce binding by generalizing bjerrum theory @xcite .",
    "the free energy of the system becomes equivalent to lpb but now the binding - constants are electrostatic in origin and can be computed explicitly .",
    "the bjerrum pairing theory establishes that opposite charged ions of valence @xmath7 and @xmath8 and radii @xmath9 and @xmath10 in bulk solution form pairs , with an association constant @xmath11 ( defined by @xmath12/[a^+][b^-]$ ] , where @xmath13 $ ] is the electrolyte concentration ) given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we interpret bjerrum pairing as implying that if two oppositely charged ions come closer than a distance @xmath17 .",
    "bjerrum theory has been recently emphasized in many contexts such as , for example , in coulomb criticality @xcite .",
    "in some electrostatic problems , insight into finite temperature regimes can be obtained from the analysis of the zero temperature limit @xcite . as a simple model for quantitatively analyzing correlations",
    ", we consider the extreme case of @xmath18 charged particles arranged as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular crystal , interacting with @xmath18 oppositely charged particles arranged as another 2d triangular crystal , see fig .",
    "both crystals have the same lattice constant @xmath19 and area of unit cell @xmath20 .",
    "we compute the electrostatic energy as a function of the distance @xmath21 between the two planes for two situations , where the lattices are either opposite or staggered to one another ( see fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) .",
    "this calculation is performed exactly by ewald summation techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "figure  [ f.1 ] shows that the opposite configuration has lower electrostatic energy and we therefore analyze it in more detail .    as a function of the separation ( @xmath21 ) , the electrostatic energy can be divided into two regimes .",
    "the transverse correlation ( tc ) regime ( @xmath22 ) , where the energy is dominated by the attraction of close opposite sign charges @xmath23 and the lateral correlation ( lc ) regime ( @xmath24 ) where the energy consists of the two madelung energies @xmath25 ( one for each individual lattice ) plus the energy of a planar capacitor with the smeared surface charge of the lattices and width @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely @xmath26    we characterize the two regimes ( schematically shown in fig .  [ f.0 ] ) by defining two ratios measuring deviations of the electrostatic energy @xmath27 relative to their asymptotic values eqs .",
    "[ tot_energy_l ] and [ tot_energy_s ] @xmath28 the transition separating the two regimes is sharp ( fig .  [ f.2 ] ) , defining a new characteristic length @xmath29 separating the tc and lc regimes .",
    "the length @xmath30 is a property of the interface , independent of solution conditions ( ionic strength , temperature , etc . ) .",
    "we first discuss the simpler situation of a uniform charged interface with counter - ions of valence @xmath31 .",
    "the first equation of the ybon - born - green ( ybg ) hierarchy is an exact relation between the ion distribution @xmath32 , and the counterion - counterion pair distribution function @xmath33 @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 . if @xmath36 ( no correlations ) the above equation is equivalent to pb . if , however , we assume a strong electrostatic repulsion where each ion excludes every other like - sign ion @xmath37 then the calculated density profile is @xmath38 where @xmath2 is the gouy - chapman length .",
    "this result is the counter - ion density profile within sc @xcite . the second equation in the ybg hierarchy",
    "can now be used to obtain the correction to @xmath39 , leading to @xmath40 .",
    "this result establishes the range of validity for the approximation @xmath41 as defined by the condition @xmath42 .",
    "we now consider discrete interfacial charges . if @xmath8 is the valence of the discrete interfacial charges , the same steps as above give the counterion density @xmath43 which is asymptotically exact for @xmath44 .",
    "mobile ions `` see '' the interfacial charge as if no other charges are present in the system . from the bjerrum argument outlined in the introduction , interface - ion pair - association then follows with a binding constant @xmath45 where @xmath11 has been defined in eq .",
    "[ bjerrum ] .",
    "the @xmath46 prefactor in eq .",

    "[ t.2 ] . in order to assess the validity of using the bare radius for oxygen in eq .",
    "[ chem_const_bare ] , we included binding constants to small soluble molecules containing the same groups , which are described by eq .",
    "[ bjerrum ] .",
    "the agreement with experiment is satisfactory .",
    "fatty acids are strongly charged systems ( @xmath3 ) and are appropriate for investigations of the sc limit .",
    "a first qualitative prediction of our approach is that divalent ions should form a tight `` stern '' layer , with almost negligible distribution , next to the interface .",
    "this is well established experimentally from many x - ray reflectivity studies after the pioneering work by kjaer et al .",
    "on a more quantitative level , we use the data on arachidic acid ( aa ) obtained by infrared reflection - absorption spectroscopy ( irras)@xcite .",
    "figure  [ f.4 ] shows irras experimental results @xcite .",
    "the solid line plots the degree of dissociation expected from the lpb free energy eq .",
    "[ free_energy ] .",
    "we used the expected pk@xmath58 of the carboxyl group and fitted the association constant to the experimental data . for calcium ,",
    "pk @xmath59 is obtained .",
    "this value is one order of magnitude smaller than the predicted value in table .",
    "[ t.1 ] , but this should be expected given eq .",
    "[ langm ] and the fact that typical interfacial charge separation ( the lattice constant for aa ) satisfies @xmath60@xmath61 . for cd@xmath56",
    "pk @xmath62 is obtained .",
    "this value seems in contradiction with table  [ t.2 ] and eq .",
    "[ langm ] .",
    "however , cd@xmath56 ions do not have a noble gas structure and covalent bonding with oxygen is possible .",
    "this has been confirmed from irras data @xcite .",
    "we should note that if the binding is indeed covalent , the pk value obtained should be identical with the critical stability constants @xcite pk@xmath62 , in agreement with our result .",
    "the constant for mg@xmath56 is pk@xmath63 . given that mg@xmath56 ion has a smaller radius than ca@xmath56 , eq .",
    "[ chem_const_bare ] predicts a stronger mg@xmath56 binding than ca@xmath56 .",
    "in @xcite it is argued that mg@xmath56 may bind covalently with aa , but by analogy with the cd@xmath56 case , we should expect an enhanced value for the binding constant as compared with ca@xmath56 .",
    "it is well known that mg@xmath64 has a very stable hydration sheath @xcite and we suggest that mg@xmath56 binds electrostatically to oxygen retaining its hydration sheath , ( with a hydrated radius @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "when the hydrated radius is used in eq .",
    "[ chem_const_bare ] ( see table .  [ t.1 ] ) , the calculated association constant is consistent with the experimental values . for na@xmath55 ions we find no binding ( pk@xmath66 ) .",
    "in general , we infer that the small lattice constant of aa results in a reduction of the binding constants by an order of magnitude or more from those obtained by eq .",
    "[ chem_const_bare ] .",
    "this is in agreement with our own reflectivity data for @xmath67 ions ( @xmath68 ) next to phosphate groups @xcite @xmath69 .",
    "we also analyzed older experimental data @xcite and found complete consistency with the results .",
    "we were not able to find similar data for trivalent ions .",
    "in this paper we have identified two correlation regimes , namely the tc and lc ( fig .  [ f.0 ] ) .",
    "the tc regime results in electrostatic binding to the interface , for which the association constants are computed by generalizing the bjerrum theory @xcite .",
    "our approach accounts for ion specificity ( see table .  [ t.1 ] ) by including the finite size of the ions and the nature of the head group charge through its size and from its pk@xmath70 value , which accounts for proton transfer and release .",
    "we compared our theoretical calculations with different experimental results and found good agreement , see table  [ t.2 ] and fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] .    the theory presented differs from previous theories @xcite in that these theories assume a smeared interfacial charge distribution , where tc is absent , and deal with the lc .",
    "a scenario for the lc would be , for example , when interfacial charges are buried a distance @xmath71 inside the interface .",
    "our approach differs from previous theories on charge modulations @xcite in that it incorporates binding by bjerrum pairing into lpb . for slightly charged modulated interfaces ( defined by a small contact value potential relative to @xmath72 ) at low monovalent salt concentrations pb including modulations",
    "@xcite still applies .    in some situations ( defined by amphiphile geometry and valence )",
    "we speculate that ions may penetrate inside the head group in a staggered configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , forming a `` molten salt '' state consisting of the charged head groups and the mobile ions .",
    "this `` molten salt '' state has a madelung energy ( given by the limit @xmath73 in the corresponding fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) , and may lead to charge reversal . for moderate salt concentrations ( defined by a debye length smaller than @xmath19 , the typical separation of charged interfacial groups ) , charge reversal of the interface by binding",
    "is also possible .",
    "charge reversal has been experimentally observed in both membranes @xcite and monolayers @xcite .",
    "we have not discussed in any detail geometries other than the plane .",
    "we expect our arguments on bjerrum induced correlation binding to apply for other geometries , such as cylinders , where equal charge attraction follows from binding @xcite .    it is imperative to compare theoretical ion distributions to experimental distributions that include points distant from the interface . only recently , however , with the use of anomalous x - ray reflectivity techniques , ion distributions are becoming available @xcite .",
    "we hope to provide more detailed comparisons with those experimental results in the near future ."
