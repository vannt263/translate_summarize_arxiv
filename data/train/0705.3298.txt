    "<S> we study the bogoliubov spectrum of an elongated fermi superfluid confined in a one - dimensional superfluid along the bose - einstein - condensate ( bec)-bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) crossover . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic expressions for the effective mass and the bogoliubov excitation spectrum of the axial quasiparticles along the crossover based on the hydrodynamic theory . our investigation reveal interesting signatures of bec - bcs crossover in an optical lattice which deserve experimental investigation . </S>"
