    "typically , the double - scaling limit of a quantum field theory is a correlated limit characterized by a _",

    ". this universal function , which is _ entire _",
    "( analytic for all @xmath2 ) , reveals the essential features of the theory while being insensitive to specific details . in quantum field theory the correlated limit of an o(@xmath0)-symmetric vector model represents a discretized branched polymer @xcite .",
    "this paper examines the double - scaling limit of an o(@xmath0)-symmetric quartic quantum field theory in one - dimensional spacetime . as in our previous paper on the double - scaling limit in zero - dimensional spacetime @xcite",
    ", we argue here that the conventional double - scaling limit in one - dimensional spacetime is inconsistent because the critical value of the coupling constant is negative .",
    "we then show that the double - scaling limit _ is _ consistent for the associated @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theory . however , we do not follow the procedures used in ref .",
    "@xcite because this would require the introduction of a functional - integral representation for the partition function , which is an infinite - dimensional integral . analyzing stokes wedges in this context is complicated and difficult . fortunately , the one - dimensional quantum field theory is equivalent to an o(@xmath0)-symmetric quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillator , and thus the theory is described by a schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it is easier and more physically transparent to study the properties of a wave function than the boundary conditions and convergence of an infinite - dimensional integral .",
    "the conventional coordinate - space anharmonic - oscillator hamiltonian is @xmath3 to obtain the double - scaling limit of this theory , we begin by constructing the uncorrelated large-@xmath0 expansion in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "this expansion is a divergent asymptotic series in powers of @xmath4 and has the general form @xcite @xmath5 where the coefficients @xmath6 have a nontrivial dependence on the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the hamiltonian .",
    "only the first few terms in the @xmath4 expansion are calculable with reasonable effort .    to study the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) for @xmath9 , we rewrite the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath10 in polar coordinates by substituting @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and we let @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we then seek a spherically - symmetric solution @xmath14 , which obeys the differential equation @xmath15 we can convert ( [ e3 ] ) to the form of a radial schrdinger equation by making the change of variable @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation has the form @xmath17 where for large @xmath0 @xmath18 ( originally , the coefficient of @xmath19 in the potential is @xmath20 , so for large @xmath0 we replace this coefficient by @xmath21 . ) note that @xmath4 plays the role of @xmath22 in the schrdinger equation ( [ e4 ] ) and thus the large-@xmath0 expansion ( [ e2 ] ) is just the standard semiclassical ( wkb ) expansion .    to find the double - scaling limit of the wkb expansion we must take the limits @xmath23 and @xmath24 in a _ correlated _ fashion . in this limit the wkb series ( [ e2 ] ) undergoes a transmutation in which all terms become of comparable size ;",
    "the series is no longer dominated by early terms and @xmath25 in the @xmath26th term is balanced by a large coefficient @xmath6 @xcite . in this correlated limit",
    "the perturbation series still diverges .",
    "the question is whether we can apply a summation procedure such as borel summation to the series . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that in the double - scaling limit the series was _ not _ borel summable because the terms did not alternate in sign , and the lack of borel summability was the indication that the conventional quartic o(@xmath0)-symmetric theory did not in fact have a double - scaling limit .",
    "we emphasize that the solution to the schrdinger equation ( [ e4 ] ) is required to be normalizable and thus it must vanish as @xmath27 .",
    "however , the correlated limit is defined by the pair of equations @xcite @xmath28 solving these equations simultaneously , we find that the critical value of @xmath29 is _ negative _ : @xmath30 this result reveals the problem with taking the double - scaling limit of the quantum theory whose potential @xmath31 is given in ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath29 is positive , @xmath31 confines bound states and the eigenfunction is normalizable ( fig .",
    "[ f12 ] , left panel ) .",
    "however , as @xmath29 moves downward toward its critical value ( [ e7 ] ) , the potential turns over as @xmath27 . when @xmath29 becomes negative , the quartic term in @xmath31 allows particles to tunnel out to @xmath32 .",
    "the states of the theory become quasi - stable ( fig .",
    "[ f12 ] , right panel ) and the solutions to the schrdinger equation ( [ e4 ] ) are not normalizable . as @xmath29 continues to decrease towards its critical value , the potential barrier decreases in size ( fig .",
    "[ f34 ] , left panel ) and at the critical value the potential barrier _ disappears entirely _",
    "[ f34 ] , right panel ) .",
    "thus , there are no longer any quasi - stable states ; quantum particles flow unimpeded and without tunneling out to infinity .",
    "this gives a physical picture of the transition that occurs at the double - scaling limit and demonstrates the physical problem with taking the double - scaling limit of the conventional hermitian o(@xmath0)-symmetric anharmonic oscillator .     in ( [ e5 ] ) for @xmath33 and for two values of @xmath29 .",

    "unlike the conventional anharmonic oscillator , the @xmath1-symmetric anharmonic oscillator has a _ negative _ quartic term in the potential .",
    "however , it still possesses normalizable eigenfunctions because the schrdinger equation for the @xmath1-symmetric theory is posed in the complex plane and is normalized in appropriate complex stokes wedges .",

    "this hamiltonian describes an @xmath45-component harmonic - oscillator , but as @xmath46 approaches @xmath47 the hamiltonian becomes quartic and a negative quartic term arises naturally . as in sec .",

    "the possible values of @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "we then make the assumption that @xmath0 is even so that @xmath60 is single - valued at the origin .",
    "this allows us to extend the range of @xmath61 from the positive-@xmath61 axis to the whole real-@xmath62 axis .",
    "the case of even @xmath0 is special because the parity reflection operator in ( @xmath63)-dimensional space , which has the effect of changing the sign of all spatial components of the coordinate vector , is distinct from a rotation .",
    "[ when @xmath0 is odd , parity reflection in @xmath64-dimensional space is just a rotation and thus there is no distinct parity operator . ]",
    "the existence of a distinct @xmath65 operator is crucial in a @xmath1-symmetric theory .",
    "( it should be noted that a similar result regarding the dimension of space , namely , that @xmath0 is odd , was found in ref .",

    "this procedure defines a @xmath1-symmetric quantum theory that has a positive real spectrum . in the next section",

    "it is convenient to write @xmath106 , where @xmath107 .",
    "away from criticality the positions of the extrema are determined by the condition @xmath108 .",
    "hence , @xmath109 we seek a perturbative expansion for @xmath110 in the form @xmath111 , where the coefficients @xmath112 are real .",
    "substituting this series for @xmath110 into ( [ e18 ] ) allows us to calculate the coefficients @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
