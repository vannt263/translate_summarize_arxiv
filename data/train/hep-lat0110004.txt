    "a lattice investigation of the large @xmath0 limit of su(@xmath0 ) gauge theories  @xcite is interesting in many respects : it can improve our understanding of su(3 ) gauge theory as a base for full qcd and allows a direct comparison with predictions derived from theories beyond the standard model , often rigorous only when @xmath2 .",
    "existing lattice results suggest that su(2 ) and su(3 ) may be close to the large @xmath0 limit . for this reason",
    ", we have investigated su(@xmath0 ) gauge theories in 3 + 1 dimensions for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "if as @xmath2 a smooth limit exists , corrections to this limit can be expressed as a power series in @xmath5 .",
    "of course , a priori it is unknown whether observables at small @xmath0 can be continued analytically to @xmath6 and how many terms of the series are needed to relate quantities at finite @xmath0 to their @xmath6 values . to answer those questions ,",
    "we have studied the dependence on @xmath0 of the fundamental string ( sect .",
    "[ secstring ] ) , of the mass of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 glueballs ( sect .",
    "[ secglueballs ] ) and of the topological susceptibility ( sect .",
    "[ sectopology ] )  @xcite .",
    "as soon as @xmath9 other strings appear in the spectrum that are stable  @xcite .",
    "these strings are denoted as @xmath3-strings , @xmath10 being an integer identifying the class of the representations of the gauge group under which sources connected by a @xmath3-string transform .",
    "the values of the ratios of the string tensions @xmath11 ( the denominator being the tension of the fundamental string ) give insights on the mechanism of colour confinement . a numerical investigation of those ratios  @xcite",
    "is reported in sect .",
    "[ seckstrings ] .",
    "in our calculations we have used the wilson action @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the coupling constant .    the string tension has been extracted by looking at the decay of correlation functions of blocked polyakov loops . to the lowest order in @xmath15 ,",
    "the string tension @xmath16 is related to the smallest mass governing this decay by the formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the length of the string and @xmath19 is the number of dimensions . if the infrared behaviour of the string can be described by an effective string theory , the coefficient @xmath20 is universal  @xcite and depends only on the number of bosonic and fermionic modes propagating along the string .",
    "a reliable extraction of the string tension must keep into account the term proportional to @xmath15 . for this reason",
    ", we have determined @xmath20 for the gauge group su(2 ) in @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "our fits give @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "those values are compatible at the 2@xmath16 level with an effective string theory of the bosonic type and are incompatible with other simple string models . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath25 , i.e. that the long range fluctuations of the string are described by an effective string theory and that the string is bosonic .",
    "the string tension is used to set the scale of physical quantities at different @xmath0 .",
    "equivalent quantities are identified by equivalent couplings . in the original t hooft s idea , equivalent couplings in",
    "the large @xmath0 limit correspond to fixed @xmath26 .",
    "we have verified that the string tensions for different @xmath0 lie on an universal curve as a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the tadpole improved coupling  @xcite . as a guidance , equivalent @xmath29 at different @xmath0 can be identified by using the relationship @xmath30 .",
    "with the method described in  @xcite , we have determined the mass of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 glueballs at various @xmath0 .",
    "results are available also for the @xmath31 , but they are preliminary .    our analysis has firstly involved an extrapolation to the continuum limit for each @xmath0 , then an extrapolation to the large @xmath0 limit of the continuum results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] we plot the masses in units of @xmath32 of the above states as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath33 works for all these states and all the way down to su(2 ) .",
    "hence for these quantities a smooth @xmath2 limit exists and the first expected correction explains the finite @xmath0 results all the way down to su(2 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 values extracted for @xmath34 are @xmath35 for the @xmath7 , @xmath36 for the @xmath8 and @xmath37 for the @xmath31 .",
    "large @xmath0 arguments were the framework used to derive the witten - veneziano formula  @xcite , which relates the topological susceptibility @xmath38 to the mass of the @xmath39 .",
    "this formula does work even when the large @xmath0 limit of the susceptibility is replaced by its su(3 ) value .",
    "this fact possibly implies that su(3 ) is close to su(@xmath40 ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : chi ] we report results for @xmath41 , which has discretisation artifacts proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "our fit gives @xmath43 for @xmath44 .    as @xmath0 increases and for large values of the lattice size large correlations appear in the time series of the topological charge .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the suppression of instantons of small size at large @xmath0 , whose distribution as a function of @xmath0 and of the size @xmath45 is expected to behave as @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "our data confirm this behaviour .",
    "we have studied the ratio @xmath11 in both d=3 + 1 and d=2 + 1 @xcite .",
    "our results for its zero temperature value at various @xmath0 and @xmath3 are reported in table 1 .",
    "those values should be compared to predictions based on various scenarios for the confining vacuum .",
    "our data immediately exclude unbound strings ( @xmath47 ) ; also the bag model @xcite ( @xmath48/2n}$ ] ) is excluded .",
    "our results in d=3 + 1 are in agreement at the @xmath49 level with both the casimir scaling  @xcite ( @xmath50/(n-1)$ ] ) and the mqcd  @xcite ( @xmath51 predictions . other calculations for d=3 + 1 su(6 ) find a better agreement with mqcd  @xcite . our results in d=2 +",
    "1 seem to favour casimir scaling .    at high temperature",
    "the spatial @xmath3-string tensions are found to be closer to casimir scaling than to mqcd ( the evidence being more striking in d=2 + 1 ) .",
    "our d=3 + 1 high @xmath52 results for the spatial @xmath3-string tensions agree with a recent model calculation @xcite .",

    "we have shown that this limit seems to exist . moreover ,",
    "the values of observables like the masses of the lowest - lying glueballs and the topological susceptibility at finite @xmath0 are related to their @xmath6 counterpart by a simple @xmath5 correction .",
    "we have also investigated the ratios @xmath11 for stable @xmath3-strings .",
    "while those ratios seems to fulfill casimir scaling in d=2 + 1 in various regimes and possibly in d=3 + 1 for the high @xmath52 spatial string tensions , our data can not resolve between that prediction and the one based on mqcd at zero temperature in d=3 + 1 .",
