    "( 2001 ) found that @xmath6 quasars are not likely to be the sources responsible for reionizing the universe , or keeping the universe ionized at high redshift , assuming a slope of @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , we are approaching this limit with the current analysis .    in a flux - limited sample ,",
    "the lensing probability of the brightest observed objects is boosted by magnification bias ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the fraction of strongly - lensed quasars at high redshift could be be of order unity for a sufficiently steep luminosity function ( e.g. wyithe & loeb 2002a , comerford , haiman & schaye 2002 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) and richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used the lack of multiply - imaged quasars among the sdss @xmath6 quasar sample to constrain the shape of the quasar luminosity function to be @xmath119 at the 3-@xmath43 level .",
    "the lensing fraction increases by a factor of @xmath47 by assuming a slope of @xmath120 rather than @xmath121 ( wyithe & loeb 2002b ) .",
    "the quasar emissivity and lensing fraction also depends strongly on the faint - end quasar slope , which is currently completely unknown .    in this paper , we present the first quasar discovered in the faint quasar survey using co - added catalogs from the sdss southern survey region . in fall 2003 , we also started to use co - added _ images _ of the sdss southern survey from @xmath122 sdss observations to select candidates .",
    "this overcomes the limitation of the co - added catalog which requires the object to be detected in a single exposure .",
    "we have generated a preliminary photometric catalog using the sextractor software ; the integration of the co - added imaging into the sdss photometric pipeline is currently underway . using the catalogs generated by co - added imaging , we were able to recover sdss j000552.34000655.8 .",
    "the remaining candidate identification is still in progress and will be reported in the future . in the next few years , the faint quasars selected from the southern survey will be combined with the bright quasars in the main survey region to study the evolution of quasar population at @xmath6 down to much fainter luminosities to probe the evolution of faint quasars .",
