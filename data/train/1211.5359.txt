    "solar neutrino physics lies at the crossing between stellar astrophysics and particle physics beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "the standard solar model describes the thermonuclear processes in the core of the sun and foresees the emission of neutrinos from different species belonging to two groups of reactions , the so called pp - chain and cno cycle .",
    "the expected spectrum can be seen in figure  [ fig : ssm_lma ] ( left ) .     as predicted by the msw - lma model.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as predicted by the msw - lma model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the long standing solar neutrino problem , consisting of reduced neutrino fluxes detected on earth by many experiments in comparison to the model previsions , was solved during the last decade with the establishment of the neutrino oscillation mechanism .",
    "neutrinos , which are no longer believed to be massless , are emitted by the sun as electron flavor leptons but propagate as mass eigenstates and arrive on earth as a combination of different flavor eigenstates , to which detectors are differently sensitive .",
    "the oscillation is enhanced by resonance in the solar matter known as the msw effect@xcite . a global analysis of solar and reactor neutrino observations indicate a best fit point in the parameter space of the oscillation @xmath0 @xcite which is know as the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution .",
    "the survival probability for electron flavor solar neutrinos as a function of energy as predicted in the msw - lma model is shown in figure  [ fig : ssm_lma ] ( right ) .",
    "actually solar neutrino oscillation fall into a wider @xmath1 oscillation scenario together with the atmospheric neutrino oscillation occurring between mass eigenstates 2 - 3 .",
    "the complete parametrization is give by the psmn mixing matrix , analogous to the quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "the decoupling into two two - neutrino scenarios relies on the third mixing angle @xmath2 being null .",
    "this last hypothesis is being highly investigated in these years as moderate indications of a non zero values have recently appeared and would open up for the observation of cp violation in the leptonic sector @xcite .     in the transition region with respect to lma @xcite ]      neutrino physics has now entered the phase in which the precise determination of all oscillation parameters is crucial to unveil new physics . in the case of solar neutrinos , the lma solution has been tested so far in the low energy region ( pp and @xmath3be ) , the so called vacuum - dominated regime with errors at the level of 10% or larger and in the high energy region ( @xmath4b beyond 4 - 5 mev ) , the matter - enhanced region ; the intermediate transition region remains basically unexplored .",
    "a number of alternatives to msw - lma have been postulated over years , the most popular one being non standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) @xcite .",
    "the different survival probability shape can be observed in figure  [ fig : nsi ] . from the experimental point of view",
    "there are multiple ways to shed light among the different models .",
    "the first step is reducing the error on the monochromatic emission of @xmath3be at 862kev which would also indirectly constrain the pp flux as this is so far only know from gallium radiochemical experimentsbe and other species leaves the pp flux emerge . ]",
    "the detection of high energy @xmath5b neutrinos started with cherenkov detectors with a threshold of 7.5mev , which has recently been reduced to 3.5mev .",
    "now scintillator detectors have lowered this threshold to 3mev and are trying to go down to 2mev with the goal of observing the upturn of the survival probability foreseen by the lma solution ( figure  [ fig : ssm_lma ] , right ) .",
    "finally a measurement of the pep monochromatic emission at 1.2mev would be a direct test of the transition region .      at the same time , as the neutrino nature is becoming more and more known , neutrinos can play again the role of probes of the sun interior .",
    "in particular the fundamental pp - neutrinos are bound to the sun light emission by the luminosity constraint @xcite .",
    "however the light takes @xmath6y to reach us , while neutrinos escape from the solar matter undisturbed .",
    "consequently a precision measurement of pp - neutrinos would test the stability of the sun over this long time scale .",
    "the ssm loosely predicts the contribution of the cno cycle to the energy balance of the star to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "detection of the so far unseen cno neutrinos is therefore a major goal with important cosmological implications .",
    "another open problem in solar modeling is the so called `` solar metallicity puzzle '' .",
    "abundance of isotopes such as c , n , o , ne and ar is modeled starting from surface abundance measurements .",
    "the `` old '' results , dated 1998 @xcite and based on 1d modelling , have been improved with the help of 3d modelling ( based on the same set of measurements ) in 2005 and reviewed in 2009 @xcite indicating a lower metallicity of the sun . however",
    "while the high - metallicity model is perfectly able to reproduce the sound speed profile in the sun as determined by helio - sysmological measurements , the low - metallicity model fails to match this constraint @xcite .",
    "models with different metallicities foresee different neutrino emissions , calling neutrino detectors to solve this ambiguity .",
    "there are four major experiments ( figure  [ fig : detectors ] ) contributing to results nowadays and many being constructed or proposed .",
    "they rely on two complementary techniques : water cherenkov for super - kamiokande and sno liquid scintillator for borexino and kamland .",
    "borexino is an organic liquid scintillator detector located in the underground gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) in central italy under a limestone coverage of @xmath8 1300 m ( @xmath8 3800mw.e ) .",
    "data taking started in 2007 and led to the first observation of the @xmath3be monochromatic line .",

    "the active target for this measurement is the inner detector ( i d ) .",
    "it s central scintillation volume consists of 278 t of liquid scintillator , contained in a spherical transparent 8.5 m diameter nylon inner vessel ( iv ) . the surrounding 13.7 m diameter stainless steel sphere ( sss ) holds 2212 inward - facing 8  photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) for a 30% optical coverage .",
    "the i d is surrounded by a powerful muon outer detector ( od ) @xcite , a high domed steel tank filled with 2100 t of ultra - pure water and instrumented with 208 pmts which detect the muon cherenkov emission .",

    ", a fiducial volume is defined inside the iv via the reconstruction of the position of the events by fitting the arrival photon time distribution on the pmts .",
    "the first measurement of @xmath9be neutrino flux came after only three months of data and was revised a year later with an error of  10% @xcite . to reduce the systematic error , during the past two years the collaboration performed a thorough set of calibration campaigns using @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and neutron sources deployed in different locations within the iv .",
    "the precise energy calibration of the detector up to about 2.5mev reduced the energy scale uncertainty to better then 1.5% ; while the calibration of the position reconstruction algorithm allowed a determination of the fiducial volume to -1.3%/+0.5% the spectral fit after 741 live days @xcite is performed in two ways , both fixing pp , pep , cno and @xmath5b to the signals foreseen by the ssm ( sp11 with high - z ) , leaving free the @xmath9be signal and backgrounds from @xmath13kr(@xmath14 ) , @xmath15bi(@xmath14 ) , @xmath16c(@xmath17 ) , @xmath15po(@xmath10 ) .",

    "the two methods yield fully consistent results and the difference in the flux value returned has been included in the systematics which now accounts to @xmath83.5% .",
    "the final result is 46.0@xmath181.5(stat)@xmath19(syst ) counts per day in 100 t , for the first time below 5% accuracy and for the first time below the theoretical error of @xmath8 7% . looking directly at the @xmath9be neutrino flux in units of @xmath20 @xmath21s@xmath22",

    "considering the high - z model as reference the measured to expected flux ratio is therefore 0.62@xmath180.05 corresponding to a survival probability of 0.5@xmath180.07 , while including oscillations the ratio becomes @xmath23 .",

    "underground and since fifteen years plays a fundamental role in most neutrino physics searches including solar , atmospheric , supernova and long baseline neutrino studies .",

    "in 2001 , after a phase - i with pure d@xmath54o , salt was dissolved into the water to enhance the detection of neutrons from neutral current interactions .",
    "neutron capture on @xmath55cl in fact features a higher cross section and a higher energy ( 8.6mev ) of the gamma cascade  standing better out of background  with respect to the 6.5mev gamma from n capture on d. at the end of 2003 , the salt was removed and during 2004 a set of nai proportional counters have been deployed in strings throughout the active volume .",
    "this allowed n - capture via @xmath56 reaction with a cross section of 5330b and the possibility of event by event separation .",
    "however the phase - iii , whose analysis has been finalized this year @xcite , did not improve significantly the brilliant results of the previous two phases @xcite .",
    "the most interesting achievement of the sno collaboration in last two years is the low energy threshold analysis ( leta ) @xcite , the complete re - analysis of the data from the first two phases lowering the energy threshold of 5.0mev ( phase - i ) or 5.5mev ( phase - ii ) to 3.5mev with a significant gain in statistics ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "in addition leta is also an advanced multivariate analysis that fits the binned distributions of four variable simultaneously : the angle between the reconstructed cherenkov track and the direction of the sun ( @xmath58 ) , a shape parameter indicating the sphericity of the pmt hit distributions in the event ( @xmath59 ) , the radial distribution ( @xmath60 ) and of course the reconstructed energy of the event ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "the measured values lie in between the two prediction and currently allow to disfavor neither of them . finally figure  [ fig : leta_cc ] shows the cc spectrum obtained in leta and , although the small statistics in the lowest energy bin does not allow to draw conclusions , there is no clue of the expected upturn of the @xmath5b spectrum , which raises the interest for the upcoming measurement of sno+ ( section  [ sec : future_sno+ ] ) .",
