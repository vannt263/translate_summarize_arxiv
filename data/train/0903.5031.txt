    "with development of nanotechnologies the friction of two smooth solid surfaces at presence of thin lubricant film between them is vastly investigated in last years @xcite",
    ". experimental study of atomically - flat surfaces of mica , which are separated by the ultrathin layer of lubricant , shows that lubricant has properties of solid at certain conditions @xcite . in particular , the interrupted motion ( @xmath0 )",
    "is observed inherent in a dry friction @xcite .",
    "such boundary mode is realized , if film of lubricating material has less than four molecular layers , and is explained as solidification , conditioned by the compression of walls .",
    "the subsequent jump - like melting takes a place , when shear stress exceeds a critical value due to the effect of  shear melting  .    in a general case the description of behavior of ultrathin lubricant film should be carried out starting from the first principles , however , such approach is complicated , because the different lubricants and geometry of experiment are used . therefore the phenomenological models , which allow to explain the experimentally observed results , are proposed . in particular ,",
    "thermodynamic @xcite , mechanistic @xcite , and synergetic @xcite models are used . also , the studies are carried out using methods of molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "it appears that lubricant can provide several kinetic modes @xcite , between which there are transitions during the process of friction , stipulating the interrupted friction @xcite . in work",
    "@xcite within the framework of mechanistic model which is based on equation of motion for the overhead rubbing block three modes of friction are revealed at the account of stochastic effects : sliding mode that is proper low - velocity shear , regular interrupted mode , and mode of sliding at high - velocity shear .",
    "existence of these modes also is confirmed by the synergetic theory with taking into account the deformation defect of the shear modulus @xcite , and the computer experiments @xcite .    in work",
    "@xcite within the framework of the lorenz model for approximation of viscoelastic medium the approach is developed according to which the transition of ultrathin lubricant film from the solid - like state to the liquid - like state takes a place as a result of the thermodynamic and shear melting .",
    "an analytical description of these phenomena was given under the assumption that they are results of shear stress and strain self - organization as well as of the lubricant temperature .",
    "additive noises of the indicated quantities @xcite and correlated fluctuations of temperature @xcite are taken into account .",
    "reasons for the jump - like melting and hysteresis , which are observed in experiments @xcite , are considered in works @xcite .",
    "three stationary modes are found out : two solid - like , inherent in a dry friction , and one liquid - like , corresponding to sliding .",
    "it is shown that transition between two last ones takes a place in accordance to hysteresis of dependence between stress and strain ( at the jump - like melting ) , or on the temperature of friction surfaces .    at the same time , the traditional use of the lorenz equation set for the pointed above problem leads to a number of logical contradictions already on the stage of formulation of problem .",
    "consideration of strain and stress as independent quantities in the meaning , that for each of them the separate evolutional equation is written , contradicts to the canons of  classic  mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , symmetry of types of thermodynamic flows is absent at such formulation which predetermines strict accordance of signs in the mixed terms in evolution equations .",
    "an output can be found using a multidimensional thermodynamic potential from which the set of landau - like evolution equations must follow by standard procedure of differentiation @xcite .",
    "earlier this approach was applied for description of the processes of severe plastic deformation ( spd ) @xcite and fracture of quasibrittle solids @xcite .",
    "both the processes of spd and processes ultrathin lubricant sliding have a lot in common , that allows supposing about legitimacy of applications of such technique in both cases .",
    "however , principal differences between these processes are present , mainly , related to an ultrathin thickness of lubricant layer ( order of atomic ) , which bring in the limitations and deviations from standard procedure , which we consider in the proper place of the article .    the general thermodynamic model of melting of ultrathin lubricant film is built in the offered work .",
    "kinetic equations are written in as landau - khalatnikov ones for basic parameters ( section  2 ) . in section  3",
    "influence of shear velocity is considered and it is shown that critical value of velocity exists , at which lubricant melts in accordance to the mechanism of the shear melting .",
    "influence of temperature is investigated and it is shown that at exceeding its critical value lubricant can melts even at zero applied shear stresses and zero velocity of shear , i.e. , the thermodynamic melting takes place ( section  4 ) .",
    "the study of influence of external normal load shows that friction force grows at the increase in pressure ( section  5 ) .",
    "influence of fluctuations of strain is analyzed which arise up due to errors in the experimental setup ( section  6 ) .",
    "all of the found features coincide with experimental data .",
    "at the construction of model within the framework of landau thermodynamic theory of phase transitions @xcite at first it is necessary to choose a parameter the values of which characterize the examined phases .",
    "this parameter is called an order parameter and describes a change of state symmetry at phase transition point .",
    "an order parameter changes jump - likely during the first - order phase transitions and at the second - order phase transitions it changes continuously . however , the state symmetry changes by jump at phase transition point in both cases .",
    "a phase becomes more ordered with growth of order parameter , symmetry falls down here .",
    "melting of thin lubricant film unlike melting of volume medium can take place according to the scenario of second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , there is a certain problem at description of the states of thin lubricants films , because such films demonstrate more than one type of transition @xcite , and their states are not true thermodynamic phases , but they are interpreted as kinetic modes of friction @xcite .",
    "therefore one talks not about solid and liquid , but about solid - like and liquid - like phases .",
    "the increase in volume @xcite and diffusion coefficient @xcite of such lubricants shows the melting .",
    "since experimentally observable is the volume , for description of the state of lubricant a parameter is introduced , that is additional to the order parameter ( the parameter of disorder ) @xmath1 , which has physical meaning of the excess volume , arising up due to the chaotization ( the amorphization ) of structure of solid during the process of melting .",
    "unlike the order parameter usually applied for description of transition processes from a solid to a liquid , this parameter grows with the increase in internal energy during such transition .",
    "the excess volume accepts zero value at zero kelvin , when all atoms of the system are densely packed and repose .",
    "it has a different from zero value both in the solid and in the liquid state at the real non - zero temperatures .",
    "however , it has a larger value in the liquid state .",
    "we introduce two values of this parameter : at @xmath2 lubricant is liquid - like , and when @xmath3 , it solidifies , and the symmetry of state decreases here .    now in accordance with general procedure , it is necessary to write down expansion of energy in the independent parameters . internal energy for a model , in which simultaneously as contributions of large shear strain @xmath4 , so of entropy @xmath5 and nonequilibrium entropy @xmath6 are , looks like @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are constants of expansion .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath20 elastic stresses are taken into account with accuracy to quadratic contributions via first two invariants of strain tensor @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where summing is implied in repetitive indexes .",
    "thus , the first invariant represents the trace of strain tensor @xmath23 , the second one is determined by expression @xcite @xmath24 these determinations of invariants suppose that symmetric tensor @xmath4 of elastic strain is transformed to the diagonal form .    a new basic quantity the non - equilibrium entropy @xmath6 is introduced here also describing part of thermomotion , which is conditioned by non - equilibrium and non - homogeneous character of the thermal distribution .",
    "exactly this part of entropy evolves during the process of external influence , tending a some stationary value .",
    "equilibrium entropy does not evolve in the ordinary understanding , but changes during time due to relaxation of non - equilibrium entropy and its transition into an equilibrium subsystem .    in the first line of expression ( [ int_energy ] )",
    "all equilibrium variables are taken into account in the quadratic approximation .",
    "the second line contains terms depending on non - equilibrium entropy , parameter of the excess volume , and equilibrium parameters .",
    "the odd degrees of non - equilibrium variables are positive , even ones are negative , all signs in decodings of coefficients are positive .",
    "we write down now the corresponding evolutional equations for the non - equilibrium parameters of state @xmath25 in a form @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the times of relaxation .",
    "it should be noted that cross members in this relationship ensue from expansion of internal energy in power series in all parameters of problem ( [ int_energy])-([m_const ] ) .",
    "thus , the coefficients of expansion together with general relaxation time in ( [ newton ] ) give different kinetic coefficients for each form of non - equilibrium current .    at description by equations ( [ newton ] ) the system tends not to a minimum of internal energy , but to its maximum , that corresponds to strongly non - equilibrium processes , occurring in the open systems at energy pumping in them .",
    "this property of internal energy is similar to property of thermodynamic potential , introduced earlier for strongly non - equilibrium processes @xcite . in our case ,",
    "energy pumping is realized due to deformation at the shear of friction surfaces .",
    "thus , evolutional equation for the excess volume assumes the form @xmath28 and for the non - equilibrium entropy @xmath29 we obtain @xmath30 where the terms with the sign  +  describe the increase in non - equilibrium entropy due to the external source of energy ( the work ) , the terms with the sign  -  reflect its going away to the equilibrium subsystem .",
    "it is needed to write down equation of evolution for equilibrium entropy .",
    "it differs from the usual form ( [ newton ] ) , since a change of equilibrium entropy occurs due to transition of its non - equilibrium form to equilibrium one .",
    "the decrease in non - equilibrium entropy is taken into account by negative terms in evolutional equation ( [ kin_s ] ) , it means that the same terms must take into account the increase in equilibrium entropy .",
    "therefore evolution equation of equilibrium entropy is written down in the form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the decrease in equilibrium entropy due to heat conductivity .",
    "the heat related to @xmath32 goes away to surrounding space of lubricant , in particular , to the friction surfaces that play the role of thermostat .",
    "since a decrease in non - equilibrium entropy and its transition to the equilibrium subsystem is the same process , the times of relaxation in expressions ( [ kin_s ] ) and ( [ kin_s_old ] ) are equal .",
    "thus , non - equilibrium entropy decreases with velocity that is equal to rate of its transition to the equilibrium subsystem .",
    "it is easily to define the current temperature of lubricant using found value of equilibrium entropy .",
    "according to expression for internal energy , the equation of state is valid in the form : @xmath33 we find analytical expression for the component @xmath32 in equation ( [ kin_s_old ] ) . in the case of non - homogeneous heating",
    "the equation of heat conductivity represents the ordinary equation of continuity @xcite : @xmath34 where coefficient of heat conductivity @xmath35 is the constant . supposing that a layer of lubricant and atomically - flat surfaces have different temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath37 accordingly , for a normal constituent @xmath38 it is possible to use the approximation with sufficient accuracy @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a thickness of lubricant .",
    "taking into account this , equation ( [ teplo ] ) is written down in more simple form @xmath41 where quantity @xmath42 plays the role of relaxation time during which smoothing of temperatures occurs over the thickness of lubricant due to usual heat conductivity . accepting in ( [ kin_s_old ] ) @xmath43 from ( [ teplo_new ] )",
    ", we obtain final expression for the evolution of equilibrium entropy @xmath44 where @xmath36 is fixed by expression ( [ t ] ) . according to ( [ int_energy ] )",
    ", elastic stresses are determined as @xmath45 : @xmath46 expression ( [ sigma_ij ] ) can be presented as an effective hooke law @xmath47 with an effective elastic parameter @xmath48 constants @xmath49 and @xmath10 are lame coefficients @xcite .",
    "the term in ( [ hooke ] ) appears that does not depend on strain @xmath50 the first and second invariants are determined as @xmath51 , \\label{second_inv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the normal and tangential components of stresses acting on lubricant from the side of the rubbing surfaces . is defined from expression ( [ hooke ] ) at @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 . ]",
    "relationships ( [ first_inv ] ) and ( [ second_inv ] ) represent ordinary connection between the components of tensors and their invariants of linear elasticity theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "here from stresses @xmath52 a contribution @xmath56 is subtracted , that is not connected with strain .",
    "let us use the debye approximation relating elastic strain @xmath4 with plastic one @xmath57 : @xmath58 total strain in a layer is determined as @xmath59 this strain fixes the motion velocity of overhead block @xmath60 according to relationship @xmath61 relaxation time of strain in ( [ e_pl ] ) depends on the state of lubricant : @xmath62 where the constants @xmath63 and coefficient @xmath64 are introduced .",
    "for the solid - like state of lubricant @xmath65 .    in the solid - like state @xmath66",
    "is large and therefore @xmath4 is large in accordance to the last expression . for the liquid - like state @xmath66 decreases , and",
    "@xmath4 decreases . combining relationships ( [ e_pl ] )  ( [ tau_e ] ) we obtain expression for elastic shear strain : @xmath67 experimental data",
    "asserts that in the liquid - like state elastic strains relax very rapidly @xcite , i.e. , time of relaxation for the liquid - like state is substantially smaller .",
    "expression ( [ tau_e ] ) at @xmath68 already reflects itself the tendency of decrease in relaxation time with melting ( at increase in @xmath1 ) , but such dependence is fulfilled only for the solid - like state and near - by a transition point @xcite . therefore it is necessary to suppose for the liquid - like lubricant @xmath69 .",
    "it is known that melting of lubricant has hysteresis character in most cases @xcite . for theoretical description of the hysteresis phenomena",
    "the row of works was undertaken , in particular , within the framework of lorenz model @xcite . in this approach for the account of the indicated phenomena it is necessary to select two characteristic values of free volume : at @xmath2 lubricant is liquid - like , and when @xmath3 it solidifies .",
    "let us obtain expression for friction force that is measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "besides elastic stresses @xmath70 the viscous ones @xmath71 arise up also in lubricant .",
    "total stress in a layer is the sum of these two contributions @xmath72 total friction force is determined by standard manner : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an area of contact .",
    "viscous stresses in a layer are given by the expression @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the effective viscosity that is defined only experimentally , and for the boundary mode @xmath77 thus for most systems @xmath78 .",
    "taking into account ( [ v ] ) , ( [ eta_eff ] ) the expression for viscous stresses ( [ sigma_ij_v_begin ] ) is written down in the form : @xmath79 putting ( [ sigma_all ] ) , ( [ sigma_ij_v ] ) in ( [ f_begin ] ) , we obtain final expression for friction force : @xmath80 where @xmath70 is fixed by the expression ( [ hooke ] ) at @xmath54 . according to ( [ f ] ) , at small velocities of shear",
    "the lubricant is solid - like , and value @xmath70 is large .",
    "thus , friction force takes on a largest value , and the dry friction is realized . at increase in velocity",
    "the interrupted mode takes place , when lubricant melts and solidifies periodically , accordingly friction force changes periodically due to the change of elastic stresses . at the further increase in velocity",
    "the lubricant melts , and elastic shear stresses decrease substantially , here friction force goes down sharply . with the further increase in velocity the value of @xmath81 increases due to viscous component of friction force , because it becomes dominated .",
    "thus , friction force has the smallest value at the critical velocity @xmath82 , at that the @xmath0 mode disappears , and lubricant becomes liquid - like .",
    "further the range of velocities is examined less or very little more than critical one , on which the elastic component of friction force is dominated that allows to study its evolution using time dependencies of elastic shear stresses .",
    "ultrathin lubricant films behave differently from volume medium , therefore at their description it is impossible to use standard formalism , as a row of principle new effects appears , which must be taken into account .",
    "one of them is interrupted motion ( @xmath0 ) @xcite schematically shown in fig .  1 .    )",
    "friction mode @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    at the beginning lubricant is solid - like ( @xmath83 ) , after exceeding some critical value of elastic shear stress @xmath70 , it rapidly transforms in the liquid - like phase ( @xmath84 ) due to disordering .",
    "overhead rubbing surface rises , because a change of lubricant volume takes place .",
    "the relaxation of @xmath70 occurs in the liquid - like state and lubricant solidifies again ( @xmath83 ) due to the compressing by the walls under the action of loading .",
    "this process is periodic .",
    "one of the basic differences from the behavior of volume lubricants in this mechanism consists of that action of shear stress @xmath70 results not only in a shear but also to the increase in lubricant volume .",
    "this fact comports with results , which are obtained using the methods of molecular dynamics @xcite , and can be reflected by modifying expression ( [ first_inv ] ) as follows : @xmath85 the dimensionless tensor constant @xmath86 is introduced here , which fixes the dilatation power ( the expansion of lubricant at a shear under action of @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is thus necessary also to take into account that the action of shear stresses leads to increase in lubricant thickness @xmath40 .",
    "relative increase in volume ) is the relative change of volume @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the change of volume , and @xmath89 is the initial volume before deformation . ] due to increase in lubricant thickness @xmath40 it is possible to express thus : @xmath90 where @xmath74 is the area of contact . equating a contribution to the relative increase in volume from ( [ first_inv_new ] ) due to shear stresses and the last expression",
    ", we get the change of lubricant thickness in the form @xmath91 in subsequent calculations thickness @xmath40 in ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) it is necessary to replace by expression @xmath92 .",
    "now the model is complete , because along with the thermodynamic melting we take into account melting by shear .",
    "further , within the framework of this work , for simplicity a homogeneous variant is examined , and @xmath93 is supposed in equations ( [ kin_h ] ) , ( [ kin_s ] ) .    result of cooperative numeral solution of equations ( [ kin_h ] ) , ( [ kin_s ] ) , ( [ kin_s ] ) , and ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) is shown in fig .  2 .     and",

    "when the system begins motion ( @xmath100 ) , lubricant begins to melt under the action of growing stresses @xmath70 , and the excess volume increases here .",
    "when @xmath1 arrives at a value @xmath101 , lubricant melts totaly , and as relaxation time in ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) becomes much smaller , stresses begin to relax . here",
    "lubricant begins to solidify again , because it is supported by elastic stresses in the molten state . when it solidifies totally ( @xmath102 ) , due to the increase in relaxation time in ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) the parameter @xmath1 increases again , while it does not attain value @xmath103 , and a process repeats oneself again .",
    "according to this , the periodic interrupted ( @xmath0 ) mode of melting / solidification sets in .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath104 the excess volume at once begins to decrease at exceeding the value @xmath103 , and at solidification and achievement @xmath102 it decreases some time yet , and it only increases after .",
    "it is related to that for an increase in @xmath1 some minimum value of stresses is needed , and because velocity is small , it value , according to ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) , increases slowly .",
    "therefore , after solidification the excess volume can decrease during some time , while the proper value of stresses is not attained . at increase in velocity to the value @xmath105 frequency of",
    "stiction spikes increases due to that at this velocity stresses rapidly increase in the system .",
    "accordingly , lubricant melts rapidly , and for the same interval of time the system has time for accomplishing the more amount of transitions from melting to solidification .",
    "frequency of peaks decreases again with the more increase in velocity @xmath106 .",
    "it takes a place due to that at high velocity in equation ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) the stresses relax to the greater stationary value at which lubricant slower solidifies .",
    "thus , the dependence @xmath107 has a long kinetic sections with @xmath108 .",
    "the excess volume increases during some time in this mode at exceeding @xmath2 and then it begins to decrease . at further increase in shear velocity",
    "@xmath109 the interrupted mode disappears , and the kinetic mode of friction of the liquid - like lubricant sets in with the value of friction force @xmath110 .",
    "it takes place because with the value of velocity more than critical one @xmath111 in lubricant stress @xmath70 arises that sufficient for providing value @xmath112 at which lubricant can not solidify .",
    "let us note that at increase in velocity the values of stresses grow on dependence @xmath107 corresponding to the kinetic mode of friction with force @xmath110 .",
    "this fact comports with offered before by a mechanistic model @xcite .",
    "thus , at the increase in velocity at first frequency of stiction spikes increases , then decreases due to appearance of long kinetic sections , and at exceeding the critical value of velocity @xmath111 the mode of @xmath0 disappears .",
    "the described behavior well agrees with experimental results shown in fig .",

    "ultrathin lubricant films melt not only due to the shear melting at the increase in velocity , but also with increase in temperature as usual .",
    "we investigate influence of temperature on the examined system . for this purpose",
    "we obtain time dependencies for the excess volume and stresses which are similar to the shown in fig .  2 . here the value of shear velocity @xmath60",
    "is supposed to be a constant , and temperature of the moved surfaces @xmath37 is increased .",

    "it implies that lubricant begins to solidify after melting at once . with the increase in temperature (",
    "@xmath118 ) frequency of peaks becomes smaller , as well as their height .",
    "frequency becomes smaller due to appearance of kinetic section , i.e. , lubricant now solidifies slower .",
    "decrease in peaks height implies the decline of static friction force @xmath119 . with a more increase in @xmath120",
    "the kinetic section @xmath121 becomes expressed , i.e. , lubricant exists some time in the molten state at constant stresses which are already able to support this state .",
    "however , due to dissipation the excess volume decreases and lubricant solidifies , and the @xmath0 mode is realized . at @xmath122",
    "the kinetic section becomes determining , because here lubricant is in the liquid - like state the most of the time . at @xmath123 lubricant",
    "melts finally and the kinetic mode comes .",
    "it is important to note that at the increase in temperature in all range a diminishing tendency for @xmath119 is saved .",
    "experiments on a boundary friction are carried out at the different values of pressure along the normal direction to friction surfaces .",
    "it is shown that external pressure also influences on the system critically @xcite .",
    "time dependencies of stresses at the constant values of system temperature and shear velocity are depicted in fig .  5 , but at the increase in the external load @xmath52 .",
    "at parameters of fig .  2 ,",
    "@xmath60 = 18  nm / s , and values of external normal pressure @xmath124 : a : @xmath125 ; b : @xmath126.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for fig .",
    "5a the value of temperature is chosen such that @xmath127 , and @xmath0 mode is realized .",
    "it can be seen that with increase in load friction force is increased , because the value @xmath70 grows , corresponding to the static friction . if temperature is increased to the value @xmath128  ( fig .",
    "5b ) , the @xmath0 mode disappears , and the kinetic mode sets in course of time , where with increase in pressure friction force increases also .",
    "the described features qualitatively coincide with experimental data obtained in work @xcite . however , influence of pressure is not so simply .",
    "in particular , the increase in load can result to squeezing out the lubricant and , as a consequence , to decreasing the number of molecular layers between the friction surfaces .",
    "it causes the change of the theory parameters and the establishment of other friction mode @xcite .",
    "therefore for the complete account of external pressure effect it is necessary to carry out an additional analysis which constitutes a separate problem .",
    "the deterministic case is considered above , however , in some situations fluctuations influence critically on the system @xcite .",
    "we consider a case , when fluctuations appear due to inaccuracy of experiment in which the value of elastic strain is badly maintained in ( [ e_ij_solid ] ) , and it fluctuates . to that end in right - hand part of ( [ e_ij_solid ] )",

    "the time dependencies of stresses at the parameters of fig .  2 at the use of ( [ iter ] ) are shown in fig .",

    "6a intensity of noise is small and deterministic modes are realized  ( fig .",
    "2b ) . with the increase in intensity of fluctuations  ( fig .",
    "6b ) the stochastic regime sets in at which lubricant spontaneously solidifies and melts .",
    "possibility of existence of such modes was shown by the methods of molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "the offered theory allows to describe effects observed at the ultrathin lubricant film melting .",
    "both the ordinary case of the thermodynamic melting due to the increase in temperature and the shear melting are considered due to disordering under the action of the applied external stresses .",
    "it is shown that these two processes are connected with each other and they can not be examined separately . for example , at the high temperature of friction surfaces shear melting is realized at the smaller value of stress , and at the yet more increase in temperature lubricant melts even at zero stresses ( the thermodynamic melting is realized ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mode of friction , which is observed in experiments , is considered in model naturally , and its reason is the rapid relaxation of stress at achievement by lubricant the liquid - like state . at the temperature of friction surfaces , that is not sufficient for providing the melting in a state of rest , at such relaxation lubricant again solidifies and it is in the solid - like state during time that is necessary for the arising the stress at which melting occurs .",
    "influence of pressure is also considered on the process of melting , and it is shown that with its increase the friction force is increased .",
    "thus , temperature effect , shear melting , and external pressure are taken into consideration .",
    "these are basic factors to which pay attention at carrying out the experiments .",
    "the obtained dependencies qualitatively coincide with the experimental ones .",
    "it is possible to obtain a quantitative coincidence , however , as in the model there are a lot of parameters , it is enough labor - intensive process , and for a finding the theory parameters the additional experiments must be executed . besides , in each concrete experimental situation the values of parameters are different since they depend on properties of lubricant , friction surfaces , etc .",
    "thus , the model is quantitative , and its modifications can be used for the description of concrete experiments .",

    "<S> the thermodynamic model of ultrathin lubricant film melting confined between two atomically - flat solid surfaces is built using the landau phase transition approach . </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium entropy is introduced describing the part of thermal motion conditioned by non - equilibrium and non - homogeneous character of the thermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium entropy is changed during time due to transition of non - equilibrium entropy to the equilibrium subsystem . for the description of a melting condition the variable of the excess volume ( disorder parameter ) </S>",
    "<S> is introduced which arises due to chaotization of a solid structure in the course of melting . </S>",
    "<S> this variable grows with the increase in internal energy at melting . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic and shear melting is described consistently . </S>",
    "<S> influence of external normal pressure is analyzed on the character of lubricant melting . </S>",
    "<S> the irregular stick - slip mode of melting , which is observed in experiments , is described . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that with growth of shear velocity the frequency of stiction spikes in the irregular mode increases at first , then it decreases , and the sliding mode comes further characterized by the constant value of friction force . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the obtained results with experimental data is carried out .    </S>",
