    "in this paper , we consider the following allen - cahn model @xcite : @xmath0 and the following cahn - hilliard model @xcite : @xmath1 the initial condition is set as @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the end time , @xmath4 is a bounded domain and @xmath5 for some double well potential @xmath6 which , in this paper , is taken to be the following polynomial : @xmath7    in recent years , there have been a lot of studies in the literature on the modeling aspects and their numerical solutions for both allen - cahn and cahn - hilliard equations . for the modeling aspects , we refer to @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the numerical schemes for both these equations . among the various different schemes studied in the literature ,",
    "a special class of partially implicit schemes , known as convex splitting schemes ( css ) , appear to be most popular , c.f .",
    "@xcite for the allen - cahn equation and @xcite for the cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "the popularity of the css is due to , among others , its two advantages : ( 1 ) a typical css is unconditionally energy - stable without any stringent restriction pertaining to the time step ; ( 2 ) the resulting nonlinear numerical system can be easily solved ( e.g. newton iteration is guaranteed to converge regardless of the initial guess ) . in comparison ,",
    "a standard fully implicit scheme is only conditionally energy - stable when the time step size is sufficiently small .",
    "it is against our intuition and common knowledge that a convex splitting scheme , as a partially implicit scheme , has a better stability property than a fully implicit scheme",
    ". one main goal of this paper is to understand this extremely unusual phenomenon .",
    "as it turns out , in this paper , we will be able to show , rather easily , that a typical css is either ( e.g. for allen - cahn ) exactly equivalent to an fis but with a much smaller time step size or ( e.g. for cahn - hilliard ) equivalent to a fis for a regularized ( and hence different ) model .",
    "this at least explains theoretically why a css has a better stability property than a fis does since a css is actually a fis with a very small time - step size .",
    "in addition , we argue that such a gain of stability is at the expense of a possible loss of accuracy .",
    "given the aforementioned equivalences between css and fis and the popularity of css in the literature , the value of fis with a seemingly stringent time - step constraint ( which , again , are equivalent to css without any time - step constraint ) should be re - examined and that the time - step constraint imposed on the standard fis may be acceptable .",
    "with such a motivation , in this paper , we further study two families of new algorithms for fis .",
    "first , we propose a modification of a typical fis for the allen - cahn so that the maximum principle will be valid on the discrete level .",
    "secondly , for this modified fis scheme , we rigorously show that , under the aforementioned appropriate time - step size constraint , the linearization of such a modified fis can be uniformly preconditioned by a poisson - like operator .    the second - order partially implicit schemes are designed with the same purpose of allowing large time step size as the first - order partially implicit schemes .",
    "but the serious time delay , similar to the standard css , happens with large time step size , which means the advantage is no longer clear for any partially implicit scheme .",
    "actually , the second - order css can also be viewed as the modified crank - nicolson scheme @xcite on the artificially convexified model .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec:1st - order ] , we focus on the first - order schemes .",
    "we study the convexity of the fully implicit scheme , prove that a typical css is exactly equivalent to some fis .",
    "we also show that the convex splitting schemes can be viewed as artificial convexity schemes . in  [ sec : modified - fis ] , we propose a modified fis ( or css ) that satisfies maximum principle on the discrete level and further prove that the modified scheme can be preconditioned by a poisson - like operator . in  [ sec:2nd - order ] , we discuss the second - order schemes .",
    "we study a modified crank - nicolson scheme and its convex splitting version , compare the modified crank - nicolson scheme and some other second - order partially implicit schemes . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : concluding ] , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "first , we introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath8 be a shape - regular ( which may not be quasi - uniform ) triangulation of @xmath9 .",
    "the nodes of @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 represents each element and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the diameter of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the @xmath20-inner product over the domain @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 . given a positive integer @xmath23 ,",
    "let @xmath24 be the time step size and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "a standard fully implicit scheme to problem ( fis in short ) is defined by seeking @xmath27 for @xmath28 , such that @xmath29    a standard fis to problem is defined by seeking @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , such that @xmath33    following @xcite , the allen - cahn equation can be interpreted as the @xmath20-gradient flow for the free - energy functional , namely @xmath34    following @xcite , the cahn - hilliard equation can be interpreted as the @xmath35-gradient flow for the free - energy functional , namely @xmath36 therefore , we say that a discretization scheme such as or is energy - stable if @xmath37    we would like to point out that the concept of energy - stability for the nonlinear schemes such as or is different from the standard concept of stability for linear schemes . for most linear schemes , a fully implicit scheme is usually unconditionally stable .",
    "but for nonlinear schemes , fully implicit schemes such as or are only conditionally energy - stable , namely they are only energy - stable when the time - step size @xmath38 is appropriately small .",
    "this is well - known fact in the phase - field literature . for completeness",
    ", we will study this energy - stability property through the study of the convexity of the relevant schemes .      in this section ,",
    "we next study the convexity property of the fis of the allen - cahn and cahn - hilliard equations .",
    "consider the allen - cahn equation , in view of , we define the following discrete energy @xmath39    [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] under the condition that @xmath40 , we have    1 .   @xmath41 is strictly convex on @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   the equation satisfies @xmath43 .",
    "3 .   the following discrete energy law holds @xmath44    taking the second derivative of @xmath41 , we get @xmath45 when @xmath40 , @xmath46 when @xmath47 , which means @xmath41 is strictly convex .",
    "notice that implies that @xmath48 , and the following coercivity condition holds : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are positive constants that depend on @xmath52 .",
    "then the unique solvability of the minimizer @xmath53 follows from @xcite and .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath54 then we finish the proof .    in view of theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] , let us introduce the terminology of _ convex scheme_. we say that a scheme is _ convex _ if it is equivalent to the minimization of a convex functional .",
    "thus is a convex scheme under the condition @xmath55 .",
    "theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] also shows the energy stability of follows from its convexity .",
    "define the discrete laplace operator @xmath56 as follows : given @xmath57 , let @xmath58 such that @xmath59 let @xmath60 denote the collection of functions in @xmath61 with zero mean , and let @xmath62 .",
    "taking @xmath63 in , we know that @xmath64 .",
    "further , the well - posedness of the poisson problem with neumann boundary condition on @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 is an isomorphism , then @xmath68 is well - defined .    consider the cahn - hilliard equations , in view of , we define the discrete energy @xmath69    [ thm : convexity - fis - ch ] under the condition that @xmath70 , we have    1 .",
    "@xmath71 is convex on @xmath65 .",
    "2 .   the solution of satisfies @xmath72 , with @xmath73 .",
    "3 .   the following energy law holds @xmath74    for any @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 using schwarz s inequality , we have @xmath77 when @xmath70 , @xmath78 where the strict inequality holds when @xmath79 .",
    "this means that @xmath71 is strictly convex on @xmath65 .",
    "now , taking @xmath80 in , we have @xmath81 . let @xmath82 in , we have @xmath83 . then , the first equation of is equivalent to @xmath84 therefore , is shown to be @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath20 projection , namely @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 .",
    "note that @xmath89 , we can then write as @xmath90 this means that @xmath91 which is equivalent to the minimization problem @xmath73 . the unique solvability and energy stability then follows from the similar argument in theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] .      as we have seen before , convexity is a very desirable property of the discretize scheme and fully implicit scheme is only convex when @xmath38 is sufficiently small .",
    "when @xmath38 is not sufficiently small , the non - convexity of the discrete scheme comes from the fact that the potential function @xmath6 in is not convex .",
    "the convex splitting scheme ( css in short ) stems from splitting the non - convex potential function @xmath6 given by into the difference between two convex functions : @xmath92      in view of theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] , a css be obtained by making the non - convex part , namely @xmath93 in , explicit in some way , and it can be characterized by the minimization of a convex functional : @xmath94 \\bigr)\\ , dx + \\frac{1}{2k}\\int_{\\omega}(v- u_h^{n-1})^2dx   \\bigg\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the linearization of @xmath93 at @xmath96 , that is , @xmath97 .",
    "the variational formulation of is the following well - known css : find @xmath27 for @xmath32 , such that @xmath98    @xcite the css scheme is unconditionally energy stable .    at the first glance",
    ", the above result looks incredibly remarkable . as we have seen above",
    ", even a fully implicit scheme can not be unconditionally energy - stable , but as a partially implicit ( or explicit ) scheme , css is unconditionally energy - stable .",
    "although , as we discussed before , we can not quite relate the energy - stability in a nonlinear scheme to the standard stability concept in a standard linear scheme , it is quite incredible that a partially implicit ( or explicit ) scheme is actually more stable than a fully implicit scheme !",
    "this remarkable phenomenon can be explained by the following result .",
    "[ thm : css - fis ] the css can be recast as the fis with different time step size : @xmath99    we write that @xmath100 substituting the above identity into and regrouping the term involving @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath102 which is exactly the fis with time step size .    by comparing the condition for the time step size in theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] and .",
    "the resulting time - step constraint in the css is actually more stringent to assure the convexity of the original fis , as @xmath103 for any @xmath104 .",
    "this also explains why the css is always energy - stable thanks to the theorem [ thm : convexity - fis - ac ] .",
    "[ remark : delay ] we now make some remark on the implication of theorem [ thm : css - fis ] .",
    "let @xmath105 be the solution to and @xmath106 be the solution to .",
    "then by theorem [ thm : css - fis ] , we have @xmath107 here , @xmath108 can be regarded as a delaying factor . a larger time step size @xmath38 , which gives a smaller @xmath108 , leads to a more significant time - delay .",
    "even for a very small @xmath38 , such a delay is not negligible .",
    "for example , if @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 .",
    "thus , @xmath111 .",
    "because of such a delay , it is expected and also numerically verified that , quantitatively speaking , the css may have a reduced accuracy although it gives qualitatively correct answer .",
    "furthermore such a delay will diminish as @xmath112 since @xmath113 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the css has a special property that may be known as `` delayed convergence '' in the following sense :    1 .",
    "the css scheme is expected to eventually converge to the exact solution of the originally allen - cahn equation as @xmath112 .",
    "2 .   but for any given time step size @xmath38 , the css would approximate better the exact solution at a delayed time .",

    "similar to the argument for the css version of modified crank - nicolson scheme , we know that also satisfies the convexity property .",
    "when @xmath40 , these second - order splitting schemes perform well ( see test 6 below ) .",
    "however , we observe the following phenomenon for these second - order splitting schemes :    1",
    ".   they do not satisfy the discrete maximum principle , and it is frequently worse than the first - order scheme ; 2 .",
    "they still suffer the lagging phenomenon or delayed convergence for large time step size ( see test 6 below ) ;    [ [ test-6 ] ] test 6 + + + + + +    in this test , the same domain and initial conditions are chosen as in test 1 .",
    "figure [ fig:2nd - css - small ] shows the evolution of the radius with respect to time for different second - order schemes .",
    "we observe that all these second - order schemes perform well when @xmath109 . the performance of standard and modified crank - nicolson schemes are similar .",
    "when increasing the time step size , however , we observe that the lagging phenomenon exists for the css2 ( see figure [ fig:2nd - css - large ] ) .      following  [ subsec : convexity ] , the concept of artificial convexity scheme can also be applied to the wildly used css2 by considering the following modified model : @xmath289 the modified crank - nicolson of can be written as @xmath290 which is exactly the css2 scheme when @xmath291 .",
    "in this paper , we mainly focus on how the behavior of numerical schemes depends on the time - step size . for a given finite element mesh ,",
    "we compare solutions of fully discrete schemes to those of semi - discrete schemes ( namely , no discretization on time variables ) .",
    "it is possible that the solution of semi - discrete scheme is not a good approximation to the original phase - field model .",
    "we reach the following conclusions :      1 .",
    "the first - order css is mathematically equivalent to a standard fis with a ( much ) smaller time - step size . as a result",
    ", a css would usually lead to approximation of the solution of the original model at a delayed time . for the allen - cahn model",
    ", we have easily proved this time - delay effect rigorously . for the cahn - hilliard model , we observe that , from the numerical experiments , css also has a similar time - delay effect for the cahn - hilliard model .",
    "this seems to indicate that the solution of the regularized model will probably have a time - delay effect in comparison to the solution of the original cahn - hilliard model .",
    "2 .   since css is really an fis scheme ( at least for the cases we have studied in this paper ) , we should not underestimate the value of other fis .",
    "thus we proposed a modified fis so that the maximum principle holds on the discrete level and , as a result , a poisson - like preconditioner can be devised and rigorously analyzed .",
    "3 .   the advantage of any partially implicit scheme is to allow large time - step size .",
    "but these schemes with large time - step size would have serious time delay .",
    "this means the advantage is no longer clear for any partially implicit schemes , see figure [ fig:2nd - css - large ] .",
    "4 .   most schemes are convex when @xmath38 is sufficiently small , which often leads to the energy - stability . now",
    "that a fully implicit scheme becomes convex when @xmath38 is sufficiently small , there is no - need to use any partially implicit scheme in this case .",
    "_ in summary _",
    ", we recommend to use fis or ( modified ) crank - nicolson scheme by choosing @xmath38 to be `` convexity size '' ( with locally refined finite element grids ) . in this case",
    ", the jacobi matrix is spd and can be effectively preconditioned .",
    "while most partially implicit schemes have been developed as a numerical technique for solving a given phase - field model , given the insight obtained in this paper , we would like to argue that it may be helpful to view the convex splitting technique as a discrete modeling technique , namely a procedure to convexify the original model .",
    "the convexified models are and for the allen - cahn model and the cahn - hilliard equation , respectively .",
    "while neither nor has a corresponding convexity property on the continuous level , their appropriately discretized model would have the desired `` uniform convexity '' properties as stated in theorem [ thm : convexification ] .",
    "partially implicit schemes ( especially css ) have been used for many different models that are different from or more complicated than both the allen - cahn and cahn - hilliard equations .",
    "we have not studied carefully how these schemes behave in those models , but hopefully our findings in this paper on partially implicit schemes for both the allen - cahn and cahn - hilliard models will give some new insight into the nature of convex splitting technique .",
