    "intersubband transitions ( isbt ) in semiconductor quantum wells ( qw ) have attracted a lot of attention @xcite in nonlinear optics since the work of west and eglash @xcite . as emphasized in a recent review by almogy and yariv @xcite ,",
    "the main reason for this interest is the occurrence of narrow transitions with large oscillator strengths . in bulk semiconductors mobile carrier optical nonlinearity ,",
    "@xmath4 due to intraband transitions is proportional to @xmath5 at low frequencies @xcite , where photon energy @xmath6 , the semiconductor bandgap ; @xmath7 is the electron energy , and @xmath8 is the electron wave vector .",
    "this suggests that nonlinearity in bulk semiconductors increases with increase in the energy band nonparabolicity .",
    "some attempts @xcite have been made to extend the above relation to calculate @xmath4 due to mobile carriers in a semiconductor qw with a view to enhance the nonparabolicity and hence the optical nonlinearity . however , as noted by jha and bloembergen @xcite , the low frequency limit is valid when @xmath9 is much smaller than the relevant bandgaps , which in the present case is the intersubband gap , @xmath10 .",
    "thus in a superlattice ( sl ) or a multiple quantum well ( mqw ) there are two relevant low - frequency regimes : @xmath11 , and second , @xmath12 . for the former regime , which is of more practical interest ,",
    "the above simple relation is not applicable and it is important to understand the role played by quantum confinement @xcite .",
    "resonant enhancement of nonlinearity at isbt is the second major theme in the exploitation of quantum wells as nonlinear materials .",
    "high values of @xmath4 have been reported by third harmonic generation ( thg ) involving isbt resonances @xcite .",
    "the third important aspect of optical nonlinearities involving isbt is the significant effects of electron - electron interaction .",
    "two of the most important consequences of including the coulomb interaction are the shift of the intersubband resonance due to depolarization effects @xcite and the predicted occurence of optical bistability @xcite .",
    "most of the work cited above has emphasized one or the other aspect . in this paper",
    "we develope a theory of the optical nonlinearities in the intersubband transition region including the essential complexities such as , finite barrier height which allows the electron wavefunctions to extend into the barrier region , nonparabolicity which affects the intersubband energies , the subband effective masses , and the collective effect which is important at high carrier concentrations . to do this we first calculate the single particle response including realistic subband dispersions and then include electron - electron interaction through an effective medium theory .    in section",
    "ii we present the theoretical formulation . various approximations necessary to deal with nonparabolic bands in quantum wells",
    "are stated as well the necessary details of the expressions used for evaluating nonlinear susceptibilities . the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath13 , here after denoted as @xmath14 describing the thg and @xmath15 , hereafter denoted as @xmath16 are treated separately . to deal with resonant effects at high intensities power broadening effects in resonances",
    "are also included .",
    "we also describe here the effective medium theory to account for depolarization terms due to electron - electron interaction .    in section",
    "iii the results of numerical calculations of thg involving isbt are discussed for inas / alsb mqw systems .",
    "this material system has become important because of its high barrier height ( 1.35 ev ) which allows large charge density ( of the order of 10@xmath17 @xmath18 ) to accumulate .",
    "very high room temperature mobility ( 2 @xmath19 10@xmath20 @xmath21v@xmath22s@xmath22 ) , and ultra - fast energy relaxation time ( 1 ps at room temperature ) of the system are also useful for device applications @xcite .",
    "we show a very high value of @xmath23 ( of the order of 10@xmath24 e.s.u . at 10.6 @xmath25 ) can be achieved from this system .",
    "in section iv nra , @xmath16 , are calculated for the same material system and also for gaas / gaalas mqw system .",
    "we find that large value of @xmath16 can be achieved at two photon absorption ( tpa ) wavelength which is near @xmath26 10.6@xmath25 for inas",
    "/ alsb system . since the values of re@xmath27 is larger than that of im@xmath27 near tpa wavelength useful applications of these systems in optical switching devices may be expected .",
    "optical bistability has already been predicted @xcite for inas / alsb system after considering electron - electron interaction through the effective medium theory .",
    "this intrinsic optical bistability of a medium is of considerable theoretical interest .    in section",
    "v the numerical results of intensity - dependent absorption including the power - broadening term are presented .",
    "the calculated values obtained by using the effective medium theory to include the depolarization effects compare very well with earlier experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "in this section we first formulate the single particle response @xmath4 for isbt , and then the electron - electron interaction is included through the effective medium theory .",
    "we consider a mqw system consisting of rectangular wells and barriers of widths @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the well region is doped n - type so that at least the lowest subband is always populated .",
    "the @xmath30- direction is chosen to be perpendicular to the plane of the wells with @xmath31 at the center of a well .",
    "the equation for the envelope function , @xmath32 is then written as @xcite , @xmath33 f_i(z ) = 0 , \\label{envf}\\ ] ] and is solved with the continuity conditions ,    [ bcs ] @xmath34 and @xmath35    for @xmath36 . in eqs .",

    "paper susceptibilities in the in - plane directions will not be considered .",
    "the expression for @xmath46 , where @xmath47 can be obtained by using the standard density matrix perturbation formalism @xcite , and has 48 terms which are reduced to 24 distinct terms for @xmath48 .",
    "resonant third order susceptibilities have been calculated for the cases of thg and nra by the sum - over - states method .",
    "for thg we get , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fermi function given by @xmath51 where @xmath7 is the energy corresponding to the in - plane momentum of the electron , @xmath52 is the energy eigenvalue of the state @xmath53 of the qw , and @xmath54 is the fermi energy .",
    "the factor @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ chi3thg ] ) is @xmath56 where @xmath57 are dipole matrix elements between two envelope states in the @xmath58-th and @xmath8-th subbands . in eq .",

    "@xmath57 and @xmath60 depend on the in - plane momentum of the electron for nonparabolic bands .",
    "the nra are the other important processes which has not been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "the importance of a complete theoretical expression of @xmath64 was pointed out earlier by bloembergen et .",
    "@xcite for a system where close one and two photon resonances were present . in this article",
    "we present a complete expression of @xmath65 due to isbt for a heavily doped mqw system in which resonances are similar to the case considered by bloembergen et .",
    "@xcite the third order susceptibility for nra is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 the terms following the double summations in the expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath68 are the seperated out terms containing the ground state as an intermediate state ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the apparently divergent terms ( @xmath69 ) in the expression for @xmath68 are reduced in the usual manner @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the expression for @xmath16 is complete and is rigorously calculated from the original 24 terms which are obtained from the perturbation theory in dissipative systems .",
    "these 24 terms then reduce to 12 terms due to @xmath70 . since the imaginary part of @xmath16 gives the two photon absorption ( tpa ) co - efficients",
    ", it should be positive for the entire frequency range .",
    "taking the proper sign of the damping factor is , therefore , important . in the calculation of thg ,",
    "the terms are calculated with the help of the perturbation theory in the absence of damping , and then the damping factors are introduced at the final expression to obtain the lorentzian broadening at @xmath71 , 2@xmath71 , and 3@xmath71 resonances @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in the thg dispersion , the term containing @xmath72^{-1}$ ] is dominant among all the 48 terms and no cancellation of resonant terms is involved .",
    "hence our approximation for @xmath73 is justified .",
    "the nonresonant optical nonlinearity can be calculated from eq .",

    "the resultant expression is @xmath76 de \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ; \\label{chi30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the infinite barrier height limit , the above expression may be cross - checked with the formula derived by rustagi and ducuing @xcite for the particle - in - a - box model , which when suitably modified for an infinitely deep semiconductor qw takes the following form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the sheet carrier concentration , @xmath79 is the bulk bandedge effective mass and @xmath80 is the total number of occupied subbands .    to calculate the intensity - dependent absorption we have included power broadening following the general formalism @xcite to obtain the expression for the total ( linear and nonlinear combined ) optical susceptibility , @xmath81 as : @xmath82 where @xmath53 and @xmath83 are two consecutive energy levels @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the lifetime and the dephasing time , respectively .",
    "it is generally accepted that the coulomb interaction between the carriers plays an important role in the enhancement of optical nonlinearity and the blue shift of intersubband resonances .",
    "for many systems , e.g. a metallic sphere , or a metal - insulator interface simple electromagnetic theories of surface plasmons and surface polaritons have been important in understanding this interaction @xcite .",
    "the effective medium theory is a similar one which we will apply for mqws in this section .",
    "the direct physical nature of this theory allows us to predict the plasmon frequency - dependence on physical parameters , such as the width and the dielectric constant of the barrier material .",
    "for low carrier concentration the modification from single electron approximation is not so important , on the other hand , for high carrier concentrations collective effects are important @xcite .",
    "we have already shown that the effective medium theory can give a good representation of the collective effects @xcite in linear absorption spectra of isbt @xcite .",
    "here we extend the effective medium theory to nonlinear processes and show good agreements between our calculated results and experimental observations @xcite as well as theoretical results @xcite reported earlier .",
    "these experimental results are otherwise explainable only when many - electron calculations are done @xcite . this is an indication that the effective medium theory is capable of representing the most important many - electron effects in such systems in a direct and physically attractive way .",
    "recent calculations by das sarma and hwang @xcite also show the importance of the barrier width in understanding the behavior of plasmons in mqws , which is in agreement with our results .",
    "we take a mqw system as a layered medium with alternate layers of width @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the period of the mqw and @xmath92 is a fraction . for @xmath93 , the wavelength of light",
    ", the composite medium can be described by an effective dielectric function , @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the nonlinear response has to be performed in a self - consistent manner since the electric field in the well region , @xmath95 and in the barrier region , @xmath96 depend on the dielectric functions as    [ eweb ] @xmath97 and @xmath98    where @xmath99 corresponds to the average electric field in the @xmath30-direction given by , @xmath100 the function @xmath101 , the dielectric permittivity of the well layer , in turn , depends on @xmath95 according to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is calculated from eq .",

    "but , the rate of increase of the first term which is smaller of the two terms , is more than that of the second . hence @xmath117 decreases .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results with the values of @xmath114 calculated for infinitely deep qws using eq .",
    "( [ chi0 ] ) .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath117 is much larger than that obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ chi0 ] ) for infinite barrier model .",
    "this is expected for two reasons .",
    "firstly , since a real - life qw system has a finite barrier height , the electron wavefunction penetrates into the barrier region . as the electron spends part of the time in the barrier layer , the effective well width increases , and @xmath117 being proportional to the ninth power of the well width , for finite barrier heights , its value increases by an order of magnitude even for the parabolic band approximation .",
    "secondly , in the calculation using eq .",
    "( [ chi0 ] ) partially occupied subbands are not included , i.e. only the transitions at or near the zone centre are considered .",
    "this precludes transitions from the first to the second subband when the latter is populated .",
    "however , such transitions do occur @xcite for @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the fermi wave vectors for the first two subbands .",
    "such transitions have been included in eq .",
    "( [ chi30 ] ) , which leads to an increase in the value of @xmath117 .    from these results",
    "we may conclude that nonlinearity due to isbt is influenced by both the band nonparabolicity as in bulk semiconductors , and the quantum confinement of the electron wavefunction .",
    "the main contribution is from the quantum confinement which is substantially modified by nonparabolicity .",
    "the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath2 due to thg are shown in fig 1 .",
    "the calculation have been done for inas / alsb mqw system by sum - over -states method .",
    "there are 14 bound levels , all the levels are taken into account in calculations .",
    "it is seen that the value @xmath14 converges after taking 10 bound levels . because sum of the oscilator strengths for the bound states becomes close to unity , the effect of continuum may be safely neglected . in fig 2 .",
    "@xmath122 is shown , which is a measurable quantity .",
    "there are 8 peaks due to @xmath71 , 2@xmath71 , and 3@xmath71 resonances from the two occupied subbands .",
    "the @xmath71 , 2@xmath71 , and 3@xmath71 resonances due to transitions from the ground subband occur at @xmath123 77 , 95 , 25 , and 105 mev , respectively .",
    "the resonances due to transitions from the first excited level occur at @xmath123 110 , 117 , 36 , and 120 mev , respectively . the peaks at 25 and 36 mev are very small , as shown in the figure .",
    "it is seen that around 117 mev , i.e. , corresponding to the 10.6 @xmath3 m region , a very high value , about @xmath124 e.s.u . of @xmath122 is obtained , which is the largest value of nonlinearity due to thg ever reported for a single symmetric qw system . since this mqw system already exists , it is worthwhile to do experiments to establish high nonlinearities of purely electronic origin .",
    "we note that when depolarization effects are included , one - photon resonances would shift from the calculated positions as in one photon spectra .",
    "the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath126 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the imaginary part describes tpa .",
    "here we obtain four major peaks due to transition from the ground and the first excited state .    from the figure",
    "it is seen that at about 10.6 @xmath3 m there is a resonance due to two photon absorption between the second and the fourth subbands .",
    "the magnitude of third order optical nonlinearity corresponding to this tpa is also very high , of about 4 @xmath127 10@xmath24 e.s.u .",
    "it is comparable to the largest reported nonlinearity at 10.6 @xmath3 m for hg@xmath128cd@xmath129te ( ref . ) .",
    "it should be noted that this resonant nonlinearity is of practical interest because no linear absorption occurs at this wavelength . for all optical switching devices",
    "the ratio , @xmath130 representing the phase of the nonlinearity is important , and should have a value greater than 2 ( ref . ) for device applications . this ratio is plotted in fig . 4 , and we see that the condition is satisfied near the tpa wavelength .",

    "@xcite are listed in table i.    the results for the higher carrier concentration ( @xmath131 @xmath116 ) are given in this figure . since only one energy level is populated here , two peaks , one each for one photon and two photon resonances are observed .",
    "the high value of @xmath16 ( 2.2 @xmath132 e.s.u . ) at the tpa frequency is due to the large well width of 40 nm and high carrier concentration . since @xmath133 ( see fig .",

    "<S> _ we have calculated the contribution of intersubband transitions to the third order optical nonlinear susceptibility , @xmath0 for nonresonant as well as resonant third harmonic generation and @xmath1 for nonlinear refraction and absorption . as examples , we consider inas / alsb and gaas / gaalas quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of finite barrier height , energy band nonparabolicity , and high carrier concentrations are included . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that quantum confinement , rather than the band nonparabolicity , is responsible for high values of nonresonant @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> very high values of @xmath2 are obtained for third harmonic generation and two photon absorption for incident wavelength near 10.6 @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> intensity dependence of refractive index and of absorption co - efficient is also discussed for intensity well above the saturation intensity . </S>",
    "<S> effective medium theory is used to incorporate the collective effects . _ </S>"
