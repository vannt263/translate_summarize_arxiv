    "the superstatistics concept has established itself as a powerful tool to describe quite general classes of complex systems @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to characterize the complex system under consideration by a superposition of several statistics on different time scales , for example one corresponding to ordinary statistical mechanics ( on a mesoscopic level modelled by a langevin equation ) and the other one corresponding to a slowly varying inverse temperature field @xmath0 or some other relevant parameter .",
    "there may be either spatial or temporal variations of the environment .",
    "the environment is represented by a suitable parameter entering the stochastic differential equation describing the mesoscopic system .",
    "the superstatistics concept can be applied in quite a general way , and a couple of interesting applications for a variety of complex systems have been pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "essential for this approach is the existence of sufficient time scale separation so that the system has enough time to relax to a local equilibrium state and stay within it for some time .",
    "the stationary distributions of superstatistical systems , obtained by averaging over all @xmath1 , typically exhibit non - gaussian behavior with fat tails , which can be a power law , or a stretched exponential , or other functional forms as well @xcite .",
    "in general , the superstatistical parameter @xmath1 need not to be an inverse temperature but can be an effective parameter in a stochastic differential equation , a volatility in finance , or just a local variance parameter extracted from some experimental time series .",
    "there are interesting applications in hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , for defect turbulence @xcite , for cosmic rays @xcite and other scattering processes in high energy physics @xcite , solar flares @xcite , share price fluctuations @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite , random networks @xcite , multiplicative - noise stochastic processes @xcite , wind velocity fluctuations @xcite , hydro - climatic fluctuations @xcite , the statistics of train departure delays @xcite and survival statistics of cancer patients @xcite .",
    "maximum entropy principles can be generalized in a suitable way to yield the relevant probability distributions that characterize the various important universality classes in superstatistics @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall develop a new theoretical approach to superstatistics , by formally mapping the superstatistical system onto a system of ordinary statistical mechanics where the energy levels are modified in a suitable way .",
    "this approach yields a new interesting theoretical tool to further develop the generalized statistical mechanics of superstatistical complex systems , and is described in detail in section 3 .",
    "we also briefly review some recent examples of applications of superstatistical techniques .",
    "our three examples , all from very different subject areas , are train delays on the british railway network , velocity signals in hydrodynamic turbulence , and the survival statistics of cancer patients .",
    "the concept is best illustrated by starting with a particular example of superstatistics , in fact the one that was considered first in @xcite .",
    "consider the following well - known formula :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) probability distribution and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we see that averaged _ ordinary _ boltzmann factors @xmath9 with @xmath4-distributed @xmath1 yield an _ effective _ boltzmann factor of @xmath7-exponential form , given by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 111 ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is that nonequilibrium systems with temperature fluctuations give rise to an effective description in terms of more general boltzmann factors . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath4-distribution was advocated for @xmath10 , because at that time the aim was to better understand @xmath7-statistics @xcite from a dynamical point of view .",
    "general @xmath10 were then suggested in @xcite . in that paper also",
    "the name ` superstatistics ' was created .",
    "this name was simply an abbreviation for the fact that there is a _ superposition _ of two ( or several ) statistics . in no way this name wants to indicate that this type of statistics is ` superior ' to others .",
    "one can also construct dynamical realizations of superstatistics in terms of langevin equations with parameters that fluctuate on large time scales @xcite .",
    "these local langevin equations decribe the mesoscopic system under consideration .",
    "the situation is sketched in fig .  1 .    .",
    "a brownian particle moves through the different regions with different inverse temperatures.,width=302 ]    the simplest example would be locally a linear langevin equation @xmath11 with slowly fluctuating parameters @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes gaussian white noise .",
    "this describes the velocity @xmath14 of a brownian particle that moves through spatial cells with different local @xmath15 in each cell ( a nonequilibrium situation ) . if some probability distribution @xmath10 of the inverse temperature @xmath1 for the various cells is given , then the conditional probability given some fixed @xmath1 in a given cell is gaussian , @xmath16 , the joint probability is @xmath17 and the marginal probability is @xmath18 .",
    "integration over @xmath1 yields effectively boltzmann factors that are more general than gaussian distributions , which depend on the specific properties of @xmath10 .",
    "if there are only finitely many cells , then the integral is understood to approximate the average over a large number of cells .",
    "the principal idea of superstatistics is to generalize this example to much broader systems . for example",
    ", @xmath1 need not be an inverse temperature but can in principle be any intensive parameter .",
    "most importantly , one can generalize to _ general probability densities @xmath10 _ and _ general hamiltonians_. in all cases one obtains a superposition of two different statistics : that of @xmath1 and that of ordinary statistical mechanics",
    ". superstatistics hence describes complex nonequilibrium systems with spatio - temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter on a large scale .",
    "the _ effective _ boltzmann factors @xmath19 for such systems are given by    @xmath20    a lot of research has been done in this direction in recent years . if there is locally gaussian behaviour , then the theory of superstatistics is clearly related to the theory of gaussian scale mixtures .",
    "more generally one can prove a superstatistical generalization of fluctuation theorems @xcite , develop a variational principle for the large - energy asymptotics of general superstatistics @xcite , proceed to generalized entropies for general superstatistics @xcite , let the @xmath7-values in eq .",
    "( [ 111 ] ) fluctuate as well @xcite , and prove superstatistical versions of a central limit theorem @xcite .",

    "is a superstatistical approach to time series analysis @xcite .",
    "applications have been pointed out for 3d hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , wind velocity fluctuations @xcite , finance and economics @xcite , blinking quantum dots @xcite , cosmic ray statistics @xcite and quite generally scattering processes in particle physics @xcite .",
    "the concept has also been useful to analyze hydroclimatic fluctuations @xcite as well as the statistics of train delays on the british railway network @xcite .",
    "there are also medical applications @xcite .",
    "consider a system of ordinary statistical mechanics with energy levels @xmath21 of microstate @xmath22 .",
    "we are looking at a canonical ensemble and _ a priori _ the inverse temperature @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "now look at identical copies of the system but with different temperatures @xmath23 in each spatial cell @xmath24 , at a given snapshot of time .",
    "this is a nonequilibrium situation .",
    "let @xmath25 be the average inverse temperature .",
    "we may formally consider a super - hamiltonian describing the entire system which in the different spatial cells has effective energy levels @xmath26 , by writing @xmath27 apparently this means the super - hamiltonian has energy levels @xmath28 given by @xmath29 in cell @xmath24 .",
    "since ordinary statistical mechanics is valid for _ arbitrary _ energy levels , in particular also for the @xmath28 , we may now do ordinary statistical mechanics for the super - hamiltonian and introduce the partition function @xmath30 of the entire system as @xmath31 where in the last step the sum over @xmath24 is approximated by an integral . since @xmath32 is an ordinary partition function ( though with exotic , locally modified , energy levels ) , it is now possible to do ordinary statistical mechanics for this superstatistical nonequilibrium system , with all the known formulas .",
    "we regard the free energy of the superstatistical system as a function of the mean inverse temperature @xmath6 and define it as @xmath33 in the statistical mechanics formalism it is often convenient to work with the function @xmath34 . defining @xmath35",
    "one has @xmath36 but one has to be careful here what the meaning of the symbols @xmath37 and @xmath38 is : @xmath37 is now the mean energy of the energy levels @xmath26 , rather than @xmath21 , and indeed this means that @xmath37 is a global mean energy corresponding to the entire superstatistical system consisting of many cells .",
    "one has @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the local internal energy in a cell of inverse temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the entropy is still given by the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon form , but formed with the exotic energy levels @xmath28 : @xmath41 in this way we have formally mapped the superstatistical nonequilibrium system onto an ( exotic ) equilibrium system of ordinary statistical mechanics with average inverse temperature @xmath6 and a new type of hamiltonian , corresponding to the energy levels @xmath28 .",
    "we should remark that the above idea of mapping superstatistics onto the statistical mechanics of an exotic hamiltonian is completely new and different from previous attempts of developing a generalized statistical mechanics for superstatistical systems @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath10 is determined by the dynamical large - scale structure of the complex system under consideration . there have been attempts to derive the specific form of @xmath10 relevant for a given complex system with given constraints from a generalized maximum entropy principle .",
    "we do nt elucidate this further here but refer to @xcite and references therein for further details .",
    "actually , what we want to do here is to proceed to practical applications .",
    "the relevant question is what type of @xmath10 are typically seen for experimental data as generated by a generic complex system .",
    "there seem to be three different superstatistics that are of utmost importance @xcite .",
    "these are ( a ) @xmath4-superstatistics ( @xmath42 tsallis statistics ) , ( b ) inverse @xmath4-superstatistics , and ( c ) lognormal superstatistics .    in case ( a ) ,",
    "@xmath10 is given by the gamma distribution @xmath43 where again @xmath6 is the average of @xmath1 .",
    "this generates generalized boltzmann factors @xmath19 that decay with a power law .",
    "@xmath44 is a parameter characterizing the number of degrees of freedom .    in case",
    "( b ) , @xmath10 is given by @xmath45 in this case the generalized boltzmann factors @xmath46 decay as @xmath47 for large @xmath48 .",
    "finally , in case ( c ) @xmath10 is given by the lognormal distribution @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are suitable parameters .",
    "in the remaining sections , we briefly describe one example for each of these three different cases .",
    "traffic delays on the british railway network are reasonably well described by @xmath4-superstatistics .",
    "the probability density of observed train departure delays of length @xmath52 has been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "millions of departure times were automatically stored and evaluated .",
    "the 0th - order theoretical model for the waiting time @xmath52 is a poisson process which predicts that the waiting time distribution until the train finally departs is @xmath53 , where @xmath1 is some parameter .",
    "but this does not agree with the actually observed data @xcite .",
    "a much better fit is given by a @xmath7-exponential , see fig .",
    ".,width=302 ]    what may cause this power law that fits the data ?",
    "the idea is that there are fluctuations in the parameter @xmath1 as well .",
    "these fluctuations describe large - scale temporal or spatial variations of the british rail network environment , which take place on a much larger time scale than the actual train departures .",
    "@xmath1-fluctuations are e.g. produced at the begin of the holiday season with lots of passengers , or if there are problems with the track or bad weather conditions .",
    "also there can be extreme events such as derailments , industrial action , terror alerts , etc .",
    "the observed long - term distribution of train delays is then a mixture of exponential distributions where the parameter @xmath1 fluctuates : @xmath54 for a @xmath4-distributed @xmath1 with @xmath44 degrees of freedom one obtains @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a normalization constant .",
    "various aspects of hydrodynamic turbulence are quite well described by lognormal superstatistics . in this case",
    "the mesoscopic local dynamics corresponds to a single tracer particle that is advected by the turbulent flow .",
    "the environment of the tracer particle changes . for",
    "a while it will see regions of strong turbulent activity , then it will move on to calmer regions , just to continue in yet another region of strong activity , and so on .",
    "this is a superstatistical dynamics similar to fig .  1 .",
    "in lagrangian turbulence one is interested in the statistics of velocity differences @xmath59 of the particle on a small time scale @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "this velocity difference becomes the local acceleration @xmath62 .",
    "a superstatistical lagrangian model for 3-d velocity differences of the tracer particle has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic dynamics is a superstatistical langevin equation of the form    @xmath63    here @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath65 introduces some rotational movement of the particle , simulating vortices in the flow . the noise strength @xmath66 and the unit vector @xmath67 evolve stochastically on a large time scale @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "@xmath68 is of the same order of magnitude as the integral time scale @xmath70 , whereas @xmath71 is of the same order of magnitude as the kolmogorov time scale @xmath72 . in this model",
    "the reynolds number @xmath73 is basically given by the time scale ratio @xmath74 .",
    "the time scale @xmath75 describes the average life time of a region of given vorticity surrounding the test particle .",
    "further details are described in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is again defined to be @xmath76 , but it does _ not _ have the meaning of a physical inverse temperature in the flow .",

    "@xmath80 is known to fluctuate in turbulent flows .",
    "kolmogorov s theory of 1961 suggests a lognormal distribution for @xmath80 , which leads us to lognormal superstatistics .",
    "for very small @xmath60 the 1-d acceleration component of the particle is given by @xmath81 and one gets out of the model the 1-point distribution @xmath82 which agrees very well with experimentally measured data of the acceleration statistics ( fig .  3 ) .    )",
    "( see @xcite for more details).,width=302 ]    the 3-d superstatistical model of @xcite predicts correlations between the three acceleration components .",
    "an intrinsic property of the model is that the acceleration @xmath83 in @xmath84 direction is not statistically independent of the acceleration @xmath85 in @xmath86-direction .",
    "we may study the ratio @xmath87 of the joint probability @xmath88 to the product of 1-point probabilities @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for independent acceleration components this ratio would always be given by @xmath91 , whereas the 3-d superstatistical model yields the prediction @xmath92 the trivial result @xmath91 is obtained only for @xmath93 , i.e.  no fluctuations in the parameter @xmath1 at all .",

    "data of the survival statistics of cancer patients can be well fitted using models based on inverse @xmath4-superstatistics . a superstatistical model of the progression of metastasis and the corresponding survival statistics of cancer patients has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the final result that comes out of that model is the following prediction for the probability density function of survival time @xmath52 of a randomly chosen patient that is diagnosed with cancer at @xmath94 : @xmath95 this can also be written as @xmath96 , \\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the modified bessel function .",

    "the role of the parameter @xmath1 is now played by the parameter @xmath98 , which in a sense describes how aggressively the cancer propagates .",

    "the superstatistical formula fits the observed distribution very well , both in a linear and logarithmic plot ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "when looking at the time scales in the above figures one should keep in mind that the data shown are survival distributions _ conditioned on the fact that death occurs from cancer_. many patients , in particular if they are diagnosed at an early stage and treated accordingly , will live a long healthy life and will die from something else than cancer .",

    "in this paper we have dealt with mesoscopic and other complex systems that are embedded into a temporally changing or spatially fluctuating environment . if there is sufficient time scale separation , then a mixture of different statistics ( a superstatistical description ) is an appropriate method to describe these types of complex systems .",
    "basically this means that one mixes ordinary statistical mechanics with another statistics of e.g. local temperature fluctuations .    in the first part of the paper we have pointed out how superstatistical",
    "complex systems can be mapped onto systems of ordinary statistical mechanics .",
    "the key point is that one deformes the effective energy levels in a suitable way and then applies the well - known techniques of ordinary statistical mechanics to this ( exotic type of ) super - hamiltonian .    in the second part of the paper we summarized a few recent applications of the superstatistical approach to real - world problems , which covered quite a range of different subject areas .",
    "we studied train delay statistics , turbulent tracer dynamics , and survival statistics of cancer patients .",
    "many other areas may benefit from a generalized statistical mechanics formalism for superstatistical systems as well .    in a year",
