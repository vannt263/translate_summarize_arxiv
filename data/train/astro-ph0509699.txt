    "odell 2001,martn - hern ' andez et  al .",
    "2003 ) , but also for planetary nebulae ( see many contributions to this book ) .",
    "high spatial resolution images and since a few years integral field units observations are giving more information about the morphologies and kinematics of hii regions and pne .    to model such aspherical structures ,",
    "a 3d photoionization codes is needed .",
    "a few of them now exist ( baessgen et  al .",
    "1995 , gruenwald et  al .",
    "1997 , ercolano et  al .",
    "2003 , wood et  al .",
    "but there are some practical difficulties with 3d model fitting of real nebulae .",
    "one is the enormous parameter space to consider , especially in the case of complex morphologies .",
    "another one is the fact that 3d photoionization models are very cpu - time and memory consuming : several hours are needed on clusters or supercomputers to make a model ( even if the time and memory can be reduced when modeling simpler geometries ) .",
    "also , the difficulty in visualising the results does not help .",
    "in this paper , we present a pseudo-3d photoionization code ( nebu_3d ) , which models aspherical planetary nebulae in a few minutes .",
    "the code uses various runs of a 1d photoionization code ( nebu , see morisset & pquignot 1996 , p ' equignot et  al .",
    "2001 ) , changing the nebular density distribution at each run according to an angular variation law .",
    "the set of the 1d outputs ( such as the electron temperature , the emissivities of selected lines at each radial position , etc ... ) , which is defined according to the goal of the model , is then read and interpolated on a predefined coordinate cube .",
    "its associated visualisation tool , visneb_3d , allows one to easily plot diagrams that are useful for understanding the physical conditions inside the models and diagrams that can be directly compared to observations . the resulting emissivity cubes ( one for each line of interest )",
    "can then be rotated and a projection on the sky plane is done to obtain surface brightness maps .    with such a procedure , one can easily construct models of ellipsoidal or bipolar nebulae .",
    "one can also treat champagne flows or even irregular nebular geometries provided that the photoionization source is unique and that the effects of non - radial ionization are not expected to be important .",
    "we also present a tool , velneb_3d , which can be applied to the results of 3d photoionization codes to generate emission line profiles , position - velocity maps and 3d maps in any emission line by assuming an arbitrary velocity field .",
    "more details can be found in morisset & stasi ' nska ( 2005 ) .",
    "/ is thus not a full 3d photoionization code like mocassin ( ercolano et  al .",
    "the main limitation of / is in the treatment of the diffuse field , which is not fully consistent .",
    "for example , / should not be used to model the ionization of shadows behind knots , as 1d models can not account in an accurate way for the ionization of the shadowed region by radiation produced by the surrounding material . on the other hand ,",
    "when the radiation field is not changing drastically from one direction to the other , the use of a set of 1d models does not lead to strong errors .",
    "the main advantage of / is that it is faster by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude than a full 3d code when running on the same computer .",
    "more details can be found in morisset et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and morisset & stasi ' nska ( 2005 ) .",
    "in the following subsections a few examples of models obtained by / are discussed to illustrate the capacities of 3d modelling .",
    "a blister model is obtained assuming a plan parallel density distribution . in the case of a face - on blister ,",
    "the surface brightness map shows a decrease of the emission with the angular distance to the star ; the same can be obtained with a spherical distribution around the ionising star .",
    "such a distribution is called the spherical impostor .",
    "the blister model presented here is a plane parallel slab , with density increasing exponentially with the distance to the ionizing star , as found by wen & odell 1995 for the orion nebula .",
    "the gas density distribution law of the spherical impostor has been obtained by trial and error , so that the hi surface brightness is the same than for the blister seen pole - on .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig : blister.images ] shows surface brightness maps for the blister seen face - on ( left panel ) , seen pole - on ( center panel ) and for the spherical impostor ( right panel ) , for four different lines .",
    "the difference between the blister and its impostor is perceptible for the low ionization species , where a ring is visible in the case of the impostor .",
    "emission line profiles are also different , see morisset et al .",

    "[ fig : bipol.apertures ] .",
    "emission line profiles are obtained through various apertures and are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipol.profiles ] .",
    "we can see that complex profiles ( especially in case of narrow off - center apertures ) are obtained using a very simple expansion law , the complexity issuing from the bipolar morphology .",
    "there are now an increasing number of instruments which use integral field units ( ifu ) to achieve spectroscopy of an extended portion of the sky , either using lens arrays , optical fibres or image slicers .",
    "these instruments can thus generate 3d maps of extended objects , with wavelength ( or velocity ) being the third dimension .",
    "such examples can be found in ambrocio - cruz et  al .",
