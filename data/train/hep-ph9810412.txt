    "in recent years revolutional progress in our understanding of string theories has been made .",
    "the key discoveries were dualities , which show that the five distinct superstring theories are in fact five different perturbative expansions of a single underlying theory ( 11-dimensional m theory or 12-dimensional f theory ) about five different points in the moduli space of consistent vacua .",
    "the dualities , furthermore , show that in addition to the five points of the moduli space , there is a sixth special point in the moduli space which involves an 11-dimensional minkowski space - time and is related to the strongly coupled heterotic ( he ) and iia superstring theories by compactifications on @xmath3/@xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively  @xcite .",
    "nowadays we do not have the complete picture of m theory so that one might argue that it is premature to make any attempt at phenomenology .",
    "however , experiences of investigating weak coupled @xmath5 he superstring phenomenology tell us that it may be that the corners of the moduli space capture most of the features of the theory relevant for low energy phenomenology .",
    "since horava and witten  @xcite described the strongly coupled @xmath6 he string theory by m - theory compactified on @xmath0 whose low energy limit is the eleven - dimensional supergravity , many interesting phenomenology implications have been studied : newton s constant and compactification , gluino condensation and supersymmetry breaking , axions and strong cp problem , threshold scale and strong coupling effects , proton decay , and phenomenological consequences  @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in short ,",
    "all of above result seems to show that m - theory is a better candidate than previous weak - coupled heterotic string theory .",
    "the most important one of discoveries of m theory phenomenology is that the discrepancy between the grand unification scale of around @xmath7 gev estimated by extrapolating from the lep measurements and the estimate of around @xmath8 gev calculated in the weak coupled @xmath6 he string theory may be removed in the strongly coupled @xmath6 he string theory . in horava and witten s picture ,",
    "at one end of the 11th dimensional line segment of length @xmath9 live the observable fields contained in @xmath10 , at the other end live the hidden sector fields contained in @xmath11 , and in the middle ( bulk \" ) propagate the gravitational fields .",
    "one needs to consider further @xmath12 ( @xmath13 denotes a 6-dimensional calabi - yau manifold ) compactification of 10-dimensional @xmath6 he string in order to get a realistic effective theory .",
    "therefore , there are several scales and couplings such as the eleven dimension planck scale , the physical scale of the eleventh dimension , the physical scale of calabi - yau manifold and the couplings in the observable and hidden sectors .",
    "the values of these scales and couplings and the relations between them have been estimated  @xcite .",
    "because the values of the scales and couplings are important for phenomenology and there are some issues which need to be discussed , in this paper we shall first revisit the eleven dimension planck scale , the physical scale of the eleventh dimension , the physical scale of calabi - yau manifold and the coupling ( in terms of the function x which is defined by @xmath14 ) in hidden sector in m - theory on @xmath0 in standard embedding and non - standard embedding  @xcite , and then discuss the possible bounds on them from the ansatz that the eleven - dimension planck scale is larger than the @xmath15 , @xmath16 which is the scale in the hidden sector just after the calabi - yau manifold is compactified , the eleventh dimension scale @xmath17^{-1 } $ ] . for the standard embedding , we obtain the upper bound on x is 0.97 ( @xmath18 ) , for @xmath19 .    an important scale which is directly relevant",
    "to phenomenology is the scale @xmath20 from which the soft terms start running .",
    "there is a significant difference for @xmath20 between the weakly coupled and strongly coupled limits . in the weakly coupled limit @xmath20",
    "is close to @xmath21 since observable and hidden sector fields as well as gravitational fields all live in a same 10-dimensional space - time . in the strongly coupled limit , as horava  @xcite has argued that susy breaking is not felt immediately in the observable sector because of a topological obstruction ( the 11th dimension separates the two sectors ) .",
    "susy breaking in the hidden sector communicates to the observable sector by gravitational interactions .",
    "therefore , susy breaking in the observable sector becomes apparent only after the renormalization scale q is low enough to not reveal the presence of the 11th dimension anymore .",
    "therefore , a natural and reasonable choice is @xmath22^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath17^{-1 } $ ] and get its low bound of 9.5@xmath23 gev .    in order to discuss the m - theory low energy phenomenology",
    ", we may need to pay attention to the supersymmetry breaking in m - theory and think about m - theory model building ( essentially compactifications of 6-dimensional space - time ) , which is similar to what happened 10 years ago .",
    "as we know , we can discuss the supersymmetry breaking in the following ways : non - zero f - terms of the dilaton or moduli fields susy breaking in which we do not specify the trigger of the susy breaking  @xcite , and the scherk - schwarz mechanism on the eleventh ( or fifth ) dimension ( or we might call it coordinate - dependent compactification )  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the phenomenology in non - zero f - terms of the dilaton and/or moduli susy breaking .",
    "> from the phenomenological view , the important features of m theory phenomenology which are different from the weakly coupled limit and independent of the details of m theory model building are of unification of couplings and the magnitude of @xmath24 and the emphases of this paper are investigating characteristic features of low energy phenomenology of m theory . in this paper",
    ", we take the simplest compactification as an example ( like most of people did ) and choose two representative points which correspond to scalar quasi - massless scenario and dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario respectively .",
    "then we calculate the low - energy sparticle spectrum under the lep experiment constraints and discuss its dependence on @xmath20 .",
    "it is found that @xmath25 can not be larger than 400 gev if one demands that masses of sparticles are not beyond 1 tev .",
    "we analyze the constraints to the parameter space from @xmath26 .",
    "it is found that in the dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario although @xmath26 imposes stringent constraints to the parameter space there still is a region of the parameter space where tan@xmath27 is large and @xmath25 is small , which will lead to significant susy effects in some processes .    in this paper , we discuss the scales and couplings in the section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss soft terms . in section 4",
    "we calculate sparticle spectrum using revised isajet .",
    "section 5 is devoted to analyze the constraints from @xmath26 .",

    "we use isajet to do numerical calculations . in order to include all effects of bottom and tau yukawa couplings",
    ", we made some modifications to isajet which are the same as those in ref.@xcite .",
    "we first examine the @xmath25 dependence of sparticle and higgs boson masses in the two susy breaking scenarios .",
    "it is found that the masses increase when @xmath25 increase and @xmath25 should not be larger than 400 gev if one demand the masses of superpartner and higgs bosons are below 1 tev .",
    "then we scan boundaries of the parameter space in the two scenarios , taking @xmath25 from zero to 400 gev . for a certain scenario",
    ", there are only two free parameters , @xmath25 and tan@xmath27 , as well as sign(@xmath127 ) under the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the boundaries of the plane of the two parameters will be determined by the consistent conditions , such as the input should naturally trigger electric - weak symmetry breaking , the gauge unification , the yukawa couplings are in the perturbative range , and there should be no tachyonic particles in mass spectrum , and by experimental limits above listed .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the curves in figure 1 represent the upper bound and lower bound of tan@xmath27 for each @xmath25 , for two different sb scenarios , different @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1a ) draws the boundaries for @xmath128  , figure 1b ) for @xmath129 .",
    "the dotted line represents @xmath20 equals @xmath130 gev , the dashed line @xmath131 gev , and the solid line the gut scale , @xmath117 gev .",
    "the curves marked ( 1 ) ( 2 ) are the boundaries of the parameter spaces in the quasi - massless scenario ( the dilaton dominant scenario ) .",
    "for the scalar quasi - massless scenario , the permitted parameter spaces are the areas enclosed with closed boundaries , while for the dilaton dominant scenario , the permitted parameter spaces are not closed in right parts",
    ". the lower boundaries of tan@xmath27 is about 1.6 for the dilaton dominant scenario .",
    "it is obvious from the figure 1 that for the scalar quasi - massless scenario , the parameter space is tightly constrained to the low mass spectrum and no large tan@xmath27 region by consistent conditions , which is similar to that found in refs . @xcite and @xcite , while for the dilaton dominant scenario there is a much larger parameter space allowed .",
    "the effect of sign of @xmath127 to the permitted parameter space is significant , as can be seen by comparing figure 1a ) and figure 1b ) .",
    "for example , in the scalar quasi - massless scenario and @xmath20=@xmath130 gev , if @xmath128 , the parameter space is completely excluded . while as @xmath129 , there does exist an allowed region .",
    "the shape of boundaries of the parameter space for different sign of @xmath127 also claims the effect .",
    "but the effect in the dilaton dominant scenario is not as sensitive as in the quasi - massless scenario .",
    "it is interesting that for the case of dilaton dominant scenario and @xmath128 , the lower boundary of tan@xmath27 is singlely determined by the experimental limit of light higgs mass .",
    "if the limit increases , the lower boundary will increase correspondingly .",
    "it may be understood from the tree level formula of the mass of light higgs . while the upper bound of tan@xmath27 is determined by both some experimental limits and lsp condition .",
    "for example , when @xmath20 is @xmath130 gev , @xmath25 from 84.7 gev to 88.2 gev , the upper bound is determined by the requirement that the mass of @xmath132 should be less than @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 ; from 88.2 gev to 102.0 gev , it is determined by @xmath139 gev ; from 102.0 gev to 400 gev , by lsp condition .",
    "an interesting aspects of the allowed parameter space of the dilaton dominant scenario is that there exists a region where the mass spectrum is low while tan@xmath27 is large . from figure 1",
    ", one obtains that the region increases when @xmath20 decreases in the case of @xmath128 and vice versa in the case of @xmath129 .",
    "we find that if the limit of the lightest chargino mass increases , the region will be reduced .",
    "we know @xmath140 puts a very stringent constraint upon parameter space of mssm . in the region ,",
    "the charged higgs mass is about 150 gev and consequently it will lead to a significant contribution to @xmath26 . therefore we would like to ask whether such a region can pass the constraint of @xmath141 .",
    "we will answer this question in the next section .",
    "we illustrate the tan@xmath27 dependence of mass spectra in the dilaton dominant scenario in figure 2 , where we have chosen @xmath25=120 gev . we have chosen this value of @xmath25 because it is in the region of the parameter space pointed out above and , as noticed in ref.@xcite , a study of this point serves to nicely illustrate the importance of large tan@xmath27 effects on tevatron signals .",
    "spectra are drawn in the same graph for @xmath129 and @xmath128 denoted by solid and dashed lines respectively . in figure 2a ) , the supersymmetry breaking scale is @xmath130 gev , while in figure 2b ) , the scale is @xmath142 gev .",
    "it is apparent that the mass spectrum will drop with the decrease of @xmath20 , just as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , because the mass spectra depend on the length of the running scale of soft terms .",
    "the shorter the length , the lower the mass spectrum .",
    "this relation between the length of running scale and mass spectra will keep till the @xmath20 is lower than @xmath143 gev .",
    "it is evident from figure 2 that the sign of @xmath127 can effect the spectrum , though not significantly .",
    "it is also manifest from the figure that the upper bound of tan@xmath27 is given by lsp condition .",
    "the figure vividly show the competition between the lightest neutralino and light stau for the lsp position .",
    "another property worthy of mention is that most sparticles are insensitive to tan@xmath27 when tan@xmath27 is large except @xmath144 @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath141 put a very stringent constraint on parameter space of various models . in this section",
    "we analyze the constraints from @xmath141 on the permitted parameter space discussed in the last section .",
    "it is known long ago that supersymmetric contribution can interfere either constructively or destructively@xcite , which is determined by the sign of @xmath127 . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the susy contribution interferes destructively with the higgs s and w s contributions . with",
    "the spectrum of sparticles low , both charged higgs and supersymmetric particles can largely contribute to the process .",
    "so even if the charged higgs has large contributions , the supersymmetric contribution will cancel its effect and , for large tan@xmath27 , can even overwhelm its and w s contributions and force the @xmath147 ( @xmath148 is the wilson coefficient of the operator @xmath149 in the effective hamiltonian , eq.(36 ) , and the branching ratio of @xmath150 is determined by @xmath151 . ) to change sign from positive to negative while keep the branch ratio still safely stayed in the bounds of experiments .    as we pointed out in the last section",
    ", there exists a region where the mass spectrum is low while tan@xmath27 is large .",
    "it is known that supersymmetric contribution is proportional to tan@xmath27 in the region .",
    "so it is expected that in this region supersymmetric contribution will be very large .",
    "figure 3 is devoted to show @xmath141 constraint .",
    "the curves in figure 3a ) which have a dip correspond to the upper limit of tan@xmath27 , while the other correspond to lower limit of tan@xmath27 .",
    "the curves in figure 3b ) which have a convex correspond to the upper limit of tan@xmath27 , while the other correspond the lower limit of tan@xmath27 . the experimental bounds of @xmath152 are translated into the bounds of @xmath147 .",
    "but it should be reminded that @xmath147 can be either negative or positive .",
    "so we map the allowed parameter space into the plane of @xmath25 and @xmath147 .",
    "figure 3a ) is for @xmath128 .",
    "it is apparent that for @xmath20= @xmath153 gev most of the allowed region of the quasi - massless scenario can safely pass the experimental constraint due to the cancellation of the supersymmetric contribution to that of charged higgs bosons when tan@xmath27 increases as shown by the line corresponding to the upper limit of tan@xmath27 , except for some part close to the small tan@xmath27 boundary , where charged higgs contributes much , while supersymmetric particles contribute less since tan@xmath27 is small . for the dilaton dominant scenario and",
    "@xmath20 equals @xmath153 gev , we can see from figure 3a ) that a quite large region is outside the experimental bound .",
    "this is because in the region susy contribution is not large enough to make @xmath147 still in experimental bound after cancelling out contributions of charged higgs and w bosons .",
    "but for the case @xmath20=@xmath130gev , one can see from figure 3a ) that there is a region where supersymmetric contribution indeed overwhelms charged higgs s and w s contributions and makes @xmath147 change its sign . in this region",
    "tan@xmath27 is large and the mass spectrum is low .",
    "this region has interesting phenomenology which have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "recently , in order to make more precise theoretical prediction , many literatures are devoted to nlo corrections of this process  @xcite .",
    "if we include the nlo corrections the region will decrease because , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nlo correction of supersymmetric contribution decreases @xmath154 , charged higgs part decreases @xmath155 , and sm part increases @xmath156 .",
    "figure 3b ) is devoted to @xmath129 .",
    "it is known that in such case the supersymmetric contribution interferes constructively .",
    "so the low mass spectrum region is not allowed whether tan@xmath27 is large or small for both scenarios .",
    "one can see from the figure that for the quasi - massless scenario , all parameter space allowed in section ii can not give the right prediction of @xmath141 and is excluded by this strict constraint . for the dilaton dominant scenario , as @xmath25 increases to 330 gev , the mass spectrum increases to such an extent that the region of low tan@xmath27 enters into the experimental bound and is allowed .",
    "the typical mass of sparticle is about 500 gev in this region .    for the dilaton dominant scenario and @xmath128 , it is possible to distinguish the interesting region where the mass spectrum is low and tan@xmath27 is large from the region where the mass spectrum and tan@xmath27 both are large .",
    "we shall discuss the possibility in an analysis of the rare decay @xmath157 .",

    "we shall discuss the rare decay @xmath158 and higgs boson productions @xmath159 . in order to search significant susy effects",
    "we shall concentrate on the case of the dilaton dominant scenario and @xmath160 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian relevant to the @xmath161 process is @xmath162 where @xmath163 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath164 s come from exchanging neutral higgs bosons and have been given in ref .",
    "the coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath166 in susyms have been calculated  @xcite . the branching ratio and backward - forward ( b - f ) asymmetry for @xmath157 depend on the coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , once @xmath169 and @xmath168 can complete with @xmath170 and @xmath171 , both invariant mass distribution and backward - forward asymmetry will be greatly modified .",

    ", large mass splitting of stops and large tan@xmath27 , @xmath169 and @xmath168 can be very large .",
    "it is noted in the last section that , in the case of dilaton dominant scenario , @xmath128 and @xmath20=@xmath130 gev , after taking into account the constraint of @xmath141 , there does exist a region ( we shall call it the region a ) of the parameter space where masses of sparticles are lower and tan@xmath27 can up to 25 . in figure 4 , we map the allowed parameter space into @xmath169 and @xmath25 plane and @xmath168 and @xmath25 plane respectively",

    "we choose @xmath25=110 gev and tan@xmath27 = 23 as a representative point in the region and the values of @xmath174 ( i=1,2 ) as well as @xmath175 ( i=7,8,9 ) at the point are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "it is also noticed in the last section that there is another region ( we shall call it the region b ) in the allowed parameter space where the mass spectrum and tan@xmath27 both are large . in the region",
    "b , because tan@xmath27 can be up to 33,@xmath169 and @xmath168 can also compete with @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "but the values of @xmath169 and @xmath168 in this region are smaller when compared with those in the region a. in order to distinguish this region from the region a we have chosen @xmath25=400 gev and tan@xmath27=31 as a representative in this region to do calculations .",
    "the values of @xmath174 ( i=1,2 ) and @xmath175 ( i=7,8,9 ) at the point are also tabulated in table 1 .",

    "the enhancement of the differential branching ratio @xmath176 in the case of set a can reach @xmath177 compared to sm .",
    "meanwhile , the deference between the set a and set b is also very significant so that one can distinguish them from the measurements of @xmath158 .",

    "the pursuit of the higgs bosons predicted by these models is one of the primary goals of the present and next generation of colliders .",
    "the next linear collider(nlc ) operating at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath179 with the luminosity of the order of @xmath180 can provide an ideal place to search for the higgs boson , since the events would be much cleaner than in the lhc and the parameters of the higgs boson would be easier to extracted .",
    "based on the analysis in previous sections , we will present some data examples of the cross sections for the process @xmath181 in this subsection . in figure 6",

    "7 and 8 with figure 6 , it is evident that higgs production cross sections increase significantly when tan@xmath27 increases , as expected , except for @xmath192 in the case of @xmath25=400 gev . for the @xmath192 production , the enhancement of large tan@xmath27 is offseted by the small sin@xmath103 because in the case of @xmath25 = 400 gev , @xmath187 is much smaller than masses of the other higgs bosons .",
    "we have revisited the the eleven dimension planck scale , the physical scale of the eleventh dimension , the physical scale of calabi - yau manifold and coupling in hidden sector in m - theory on @xmath0 and discussed the reasonable bounds on them under the ansatz that the scale of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath46^{-1}$ ] should be lower than the eleven dimension planck scale .",

    "we have calculated sparticle spectra at different values of @xmath20 and found that the spectra lower when @xmath20 decrease . therefore , compared with the spectra in the weakly coupling string models and general susy gut models , the spectra in m theory phenomenology are lower , which is , of course , more easier to search at colliders . the lep experiment and @xmath26 constraints on the parameter space in the dilaton dominant and scalar quasi - massless supersymmetry",

    "finally , we give predictions for the rare decay @xmath194 and neutral higgs boson productions .",
    "an interesting result is that one could discover supersymmetry from @xmath195 in b factories if nature give us large tan@xmath27 and low mass spectra which come out as a consequence of m theory low energy phenomenology .",
