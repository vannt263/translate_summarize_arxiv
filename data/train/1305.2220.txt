    "in approximating smooth submanifolds by polyhedra , it is well known that pathologies may occur if the triangles of the polyhedra become too thin .",
    "for example , the famous  schwartz lantern \" ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 3.1.3 ) shows that the areas of a sequence of polyhedra @xmath8 approximating a surface @xmath9 may fail to converge unless the ratio of the area of a general constituent triangle to the square of its diameter is bounded away from zero . on the other hand , if this ",
    "fatness \" condition is imposed then the sequence enjoys convergence not only to first order ( i.e. convergence of areas ) , but also to second order in the sense that certain curvature integrals ( or , more precisely , their polyhedral analogues ) for the @xmath8 converge weakly to the corresponding integrals for @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key observation is that the corresponding _ absolute _ curvature integrals of the @xmath8 remain bounded in the course of the approximation process",
    ".    however , there is a further subtlety : even if the fatness condition is imposed , the bound on the absolute curvature integrals of the @xmath8 depends on the @xmath10 norm of @xmath9 , which may be much larger than its absolute curvature integral ( cf .",
    "section [ sect : quadratic ] below ) .    in the present paper",
    "we show that by means of a more careful approach , the @xmath8 may be chosen so that their absolute curvature integrals are bounded by universal constant multiples of the corresponding integrals for @xmath9 . in order to isolate the analytic aspects of the process , instead of a smooth surface @xmath9 we consider smooth and piecewise linear ( pl ) _ functions _ @xmath11 defined on an open subset @xmath12 , replacing curvatures of @xmath9 by invariants of the hessian of @xmath11 .",
    "the curvature integrals of @xmath9 that we consider are artifacts of the manifold @xmath13 of unit normals to @xmath9 . using the area formula ,",
    "it is easy to see that the area of @xmath14 is bounded above and below by constant multiples of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the second fundamental form . by the same token",
    ", the area of the graph of the differential @xmath7 of a @xmath10 function is bounded above and below by constant multiples of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hessian ( cf . ) .    for certain classes of singular surfaces @xmath9 and functions @xmath11",
    ", it is known that there exist integral currents @xmath14 and @xmath19 that serve , respectively , as suitable replacements for the manifold of unit normals and the graph of the differential .",
    "we state the relevant theorem in the latter case .",
    "[ @xcite][thm : ma ] let @xmath12 be an open set and let @xmath11 be a function with locally integrable differential @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath11 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath20 ) .",
    "then there is at most one integral current @xmath19 of dimension @xmath21 in the cotangent bundle @xmath22 , with the properties    * @xmath23 * @xmath19 is * lagrangian * , in the sense that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the canonical symplectic form of @xmath26 * if @xmath27 then @xmath28 * for any compactly supported continuous function @xmath29 @xmath30    here @xmath31 is the projection .",
    "if @xmath19 exists then we say that @xmath11 is a _ monge - ampre ( ma ) function _ , and refer to @xmath19 as the * gradient cycle * of @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath33 and its derivative is locally lipschitz ) then @xmath19 is given by integration over the graph of the differential @xmath7 , which is a lipschitz submanifold of @xmath26 with orientation induced by the standard orientation of @xmath12 .",
    "thus if @xmath11 is not smooth then we may think of @xmath19 as a substitute for this graph , and its existence is an indication that @xmath11 has good second order properties .",
    "it is not difficult ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to construct @xmath2 directly for a pl function @xmath0 ; for completeness , and to fix ideas , we give the construction in detail for @xmath34 in section [ sect : d of pl ] below . in these terms",
    "our main theorem is the following .",
    "we denote the space of pl functions on an open set @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath37 be open and @xmath32 . given an open set @xmath38 , there exists a sequence @xmath39 , with @xmath40 uniformly , such that @xmath41    in fact it is enough to prove theorem [ thm : main ] in the case that @xmath42 : convolving with a mollifier we may approximate any @xmath32 locally by @xmath10 functions @xmath43 , in such a way that the hessians of the @xmath43 converge pointwise a.e . to that of @xmath11 . invoking the estimates for the @xmath43 and using a diagonal process",
    ", the desired estimate for @xmath11 follows from the dominated convergence theorem .    as mentioned above",
    ", there is a weaker form of theorem [ thm : main ] that holds for any pl approximation in which the underlying triangulations are uniformly fat .",
    "this is given here as proposition [ prop : crude ] . in this result",
    "the masses of the @xmath44 are bounded in terms of the integral of the square of the norm of the hessian matrix @xmath18 . by the area formula , @xmath45 for @xmath42 , where @xmath46^{\\frac 1 2}\\ ] ] is the hilbert - schmidt norm of the hessian .",
    "thus the bound of theorem [ thm : main ] is stronger in the event that @xmath18 has one small and one large eigenvalue over a large region of @xmath47 .",
    "all functions @xmath11 known to be ma are _ strongly approximable _ in the sense of @xcite , i.e. there is a sequence @xmath48 of @xmath10 functions that converge to @xmath11 in @xmath49 such that the @xmath50 are locally uniformly bounded in mass .",
    "the differential current @xmath19 then arises as the limit of the @xmath50 : the federer - fleming compactness theorem for integral currents implies that a subsequence converges , and the uniqueness result from the first paragraph above implies that the limit is uniquely determined .",
    "a fundamental conjecture states that every ma function is strongly approximable .    in view of the simple construction of @xmath19 for pl functions ,",
    "it is natural to consider also the class of * pl strongly approximable * functions , which are defined analogously by taking the approximating functions @xmath48 to be pl instead of @xmath10 .",
    "again one conjectures that any ma function is pl strongly approximable .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] implies that these two notions coincide in dimension @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath11 is strongly approximable iff @xmath11 is pl strongly approximable .    that a pl strongly approximable function must be strongly approximable follows from a construction of u. brehm and w. khnel @xcite , which ( in our language ) shows that any pl function @xmath0 of two variables may be approximated by @xmath10 functions @xmath48 in such a way that the local masses of the @xmath50 are bounded in terms of the local mass of @xmath2 .",
    "the other direction follows from theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "the basic idea of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] arises from the analysis of pl approximations to a given quadratic form @xmath53 given in section [ sect : example ] : we interpolate linearly between the values of @xmath54 on the vertices of a square grid to obtain a pl function @xmath0 , and show that if the grid is aligned with the eigenvectors of @xmath54 then the mass of @xmath2 over an open subset @xmath55 is roughly proportional to @xmath56 . if , on the other hand , the grid is aligned haphazardly , then this mass is more like @xmath57 , corresponding to the estimate of proposition [ prop : crude ] .    in order to carry this analysis over to a given @xmath10 function @xmath11 defined in a neighborhood of a set @xmath35 , we attempt to impose a subdivided square grid of small mesh size so as to align with the eigenvectors of @xmath18 .",
    "since the eigenvectors are not constant this is obviously not possible , so instead we do this in approximate fashion in open sets where the oscillation of @xmath18 is small , the union of which yields a triangulated set @xmath58 such that @xmath59 has small area .",
    "we also take care to ensure that the square grids remain separated from each other by a distance proportional to the mesh size .",
    "this allows us to invoke a well - known ( albeit apparently unpublished ) result from the theory of mesh generation , stating that this partial triangulation of @xmath35 may be completed to a full triangulation with a lower bound on the fatness of the triangles :    [ thm : chew ] let @xmath60 , and let @xmath61 be a closed polygonal region , and @xmath62 a system of vertices and edges in @xmath63 , such that no two vertices of @xmath64 are closer than @xmath65 and every edge of @xmath62 has length @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "then there exists a triangulation of @xmath63 that includes @xmath62 such that all edges have length @xmath67 $ ] and all angles @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "our estimates in the quadratic case carry over to yield the desired bounds on the mass of @xmath69 .",
    "meanwhile the mass of @xmath70 is controlled only by the cruder bounds of proposition [ prop : crude ] , but since @xmath59 has small measure this quantity is also small .",
    "the absence of the analogue of theorem [ thm : chew ] in dimensions larger than 2 appears to constitute the principal obstacle to extending theorem [ thm : main ] to higher dimensions .    for simplicity we will identify the dual space @xmath71 with @xmath72 in the usual way , and conflate the differential @xmath7 and the gradient @xmath73 of a function @xmath11 .",
