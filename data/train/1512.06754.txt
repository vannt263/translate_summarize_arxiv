    "since the early days of nonlinear science and the explosion of interest in integrable models , it was realized that the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite is a universal model describing envelope solitons in dispersive nonlinear media ; as such , it plays a central role in a variety of contexts , ranging from water waves and plasmas  @xcite to nonlinear optics  @xcite and atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , already from the 70s , it was found that the interaction of waves of different frequencies gives rise to vector ( multi - component ) nls models  @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising that since then a considerable volume of work was dedicated into multi - component nls equation settings . arguably , the workhorse of many relevant studies was the manakov system  @xcite ( which is integrable  @xcite ) , characterized by equal nonlinear interactions within and between components .",
    "vector solitons of this model have attracted much attention , especially in the setting of defocusing intra- and inter - component interactions . in such a case , of particular interest",
    "are dark - bright ( db ) solitons . in these structures ,",
    "the bright soliton , which would not exist in the defocusing setting , only emerges because of an effective potential well created by the dark soliton through the inter - component interaction ; as such , db solitons can be thought of as `` symbiotic '' structures .",
    "db solitons have attracted much attention  @xcite , especially due to potential applications in optics , where dark solitons could be used as adjustable waveguides for weak signals ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "importantly , these early theoretical developments , focusing on the integrable theory , its exact solutions and perturbations thereof , were also accompanied by pioneering experiments in photorefractive media , where db solitons were observed and studied  @xcite .    here , we target this specific multi - component setting , featuring defocusing inter- and intra - component nonlinearities , and the corresponding solitary waves ( below , we use the term `` soliton '' in a loose sense , without implying complete integrability ) ; for focusing multi - component systems and bright solitons see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will also consider atomic becs  @xcite , which have provided a new spark for this theme  @xcite . indeed , seminal experiments have realized multi - component becs , as mixtures of , e.g. , different spin states of the same atom species ( _ pseudo - spinor _ condensates )  @xcite , or different zeeman sub - levels of the same hyperfine level ( _ spinor _ condensates )  @xcite . in becs , the soliton in one species can be the same or different to that in the other species . of particular interest here will be vector solitons where one component is a dark soliton .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in sec .  2 , we present the model and discuss its experimental motivation . in sec .  3",
    ", we analyze statics and dynamics of single and multiple vector solitons . in sec .  4 , we discuss various settings and parameter regimes for vector solitons . finally , in sec .  5",
    ", we briefly summarize our conclusions and discuss future challenges .",
    "a mixture of @xmath0 bosonic components can be described , at the mean - field level  @xcite , by a system of @xmath0 coupled nls equations [ alias gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) in this context ] . when the different components pertain to the same atom species , this system reads ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "this system conserves the energy @xmath10 and the total number of atoms , @xmath11 ; furthermore , in the absence of linear inter - conversions ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , the number of atoms of each component @xmath13 is conserved .",
    "the principal paradigm on which our exposition will be based is that of two bosonic species ( @xmath14 ) , where we will assume that the system is homogeneous ( @xmath15 ) or trapped ( @xmath16 ) . in the homogeneous case with @xmath12 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the binary mixture is _ immiscible _ provided that the following _ immiscibility condition",
    "_ holds  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called miscibility parameter . in the experiments ,",
    "this parameter assumes values of the order of @xmath20 or even less ; for example , @xmath21 or @xmath22 for a mixture of two spin states of @xmath23rb  @xcite or @xmath24na  @xcite bec , respectively . condition  ( [ delta ] ) corresponds to the case where the mutual repulsion between species is stronger than the repulsion between atoms of the same species .",
    "then , the two species do not mix and instead tend to separate by filling two different spatial regions , thus forming , e.g. , a `` ball and shell '' configuration ( cf .",
    "experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or two domain - wall structures of a similar type , one in each component  @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we will chiefly operate in the vicinity of this threshold which favors the emergence of db solitons , and use @xmath12 .",
    "this setting is relevant both to experiments and to the mathematically tractable manakov limit of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "experimental results have demonstrated that the prototypical vector solitons that may be supported in such quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems involve a dark soliton in one component , while the second one may be either a bright soliton , so that the vector soliton is a dark - bright ( db ) soliton  @xcite , or a dark soliton , so that the vector soliton is a dark - dark ( dd ) soliton  @xcite . it should also be noted that , in theory , dark - antidark solitons ( the latter being humps , instead of dips , on top of the background state ) , have also been predicted  @xcite .      , upon propagation under linear evolution , leading to dispersion [ panel ( b ) ] , nonlinear evolution of uncoupled components , again leading to breakup / dispersion [ panel ( d ) ] , and under coupled nonlinear evolution [ panel ( c ) ] . a similar case example , but for two bright beams , is shown in the right four panels ( adapted from ref .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=117 ]    as discussed above , db soliton states were first observed in pioneering experiments in optics  @xcite ; their key findings , summarized also in fig .",
    "[ revip_fig1 ] , were as follows .",
    "experiments were performed in a photorefractive ( strontium barium niobate ) medium , with an input corresponding to a dark soliton ( created through an optical mask ) in one component , coupled to a bright soliton in the second component [ panel ( a ) in the left of the figure ] .",
    "for low intensity , i.e. , for a linear evolution , both components underwent dispersion - induced broadening [ panel ( b ) ] . on the other hand , uncoupled nonlinear evolution [ panel ( d ) ] again resulted in dispersion of the bright component , since the corresponding structure was not effectively confined by the presence of the dark one .",
    "only when the evolution is nonlinear _ and _ the two components are coupled [ panel ( c ) ] , is it possible for the db soliton state to persist .",
    "similarly , for initial conditions conducive to a breakup into two db waves ( right four panels in fig .  [ revip_fig1 ] ) , linear propagation , and uncoupled nonlinear propagation [ panels ( b ) and ( d ) ] do not lead to coherent states .",
    "only the coupled nonlinear evolution [ panel ( c ) ] leads to a robust pair of db solitons , i.e. , a so - called `` solitonic gluon ''  @xcite , or `` soliton molecule '' .           in the context of becs , db solitons",
    "were first predicted and studied in binary becs in ref .  @xcite . while this theoretical work triggered a number of follow - up studies ramifying the original idea  @xcite , arguably , it was the hamburg experiment  @xcite , and subsequently those at pullman  @xcite that put the topic in a fundamentally new perspective by revealing the experimental possibilities thereof .",
    "in particular , in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that db solitons can be created by a phase - imprinting technique in the two - component setting , and also showcased their robust oscillations in a quasi-1d parabolic trap . in turn , a different breed of experiments was introduced later , where both db  @xcite and dd  @xcite solitons were generated spontaneously via instability mechanisms in counterflow experiments : specifically , the condensates ( composed of two distinct hyperfine states ) were spatially separated and subsequently `` slammed '' against each other , leading to the spontaneous emergence of the coherent structures of interest .",
    "examples illustrating the above mentioned experimental possibilities and findings are shown in figs .",
    "[ revip_fig2 ] and  [ revip_fig3 ] .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ revip_fig2 ] depicts robust oscillations of a db soliton in a quasi-1d trap [ left panel ( a ) ] .",
    "the time - series of the wave center position [ left panel ( b ) ] allows to infer the oscillation frequency , as well as its dependence on the `` mass '' ( number of atoms ) of the bright component [ left panel ( c ) ] ; this suggests that heavier solitons become slower , bearing an increasing period .",
    "in addition , collisions between two separately oscillating db solitons are shown [ left panel ( d ) ] .",
    "the right set of panels depicts that states with two up to six db solitons can ( at least transiently ) form during the complex evolution of the counterflow experiments",
    ". this again points to the idea of soliton molecules and progressively more elaborate states bearing multiple db solitons .    , while for a lower energy it is reflected [ panels ( e - h ) ] .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=166 ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ revip_fig3 ] motivates some variants on the theme of db solitons in becs , by virtue of additional experiments  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows that in the counterflow experiments not only db solitons but also dd ones are generated .",
    "the middle and right panels depict the interaction of a db soliton with a potential barrier , induced by a gaussian laser beam .",
    "when the barrier is shallow ( or equivalently the wave bears sufficient energy to overcome the barrier ) , transmission through the barrier is observed ( middle panel ) , while in the reverse scenario of a deep barrier ( or insufficiently energetic db solitons ) , near perfect reflection is realized ( right panel ) .",
    "motivated by these experimental results , we now turn to a theoretical study of the db and dd solitons in the 1d setting . there , in the case of two components and in the absence of linear coupling , eq .  ( [ 2c ] )",

    "this is motivated , e.g. , by the physically relevant case of the @xmath23rb bec , where hyperfine states are characterized by almost equal coupling strengths  @xcite . for @xmath28 , and neglecting to a first approximation the confining potential , eqs .",

    "the soliton velocity is given by @xmath37 , and phase @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of the above manakov system is its invariance under su@xmath40 rotations , i.e. , under the action of matrices of the form : @xmath41 with @xmath42 , for complex @xmath43 ( stars denote complex conjugation ) . for concreteness , limiting our considerations to the so@xmath40 case  @xcite , we choose @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "second , the dd solitons are generally _ asymmetric _ , unless @xmath49 .",
    "third , the time - dependence of phase @xmath50 results in _ time - dependent density profiles _ , unless @xmath48 ; thus , dd solitons may feature time-_dependent _ densities . for @xmath51 ,",

    "hence , a fundamental ( bound ) state of the bright component , pertaining to the db soliton , always exists .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 ) , it is also possible for the dark component to trap a first excited state in the bright one ( i.e. , a two - bright - soliton anti - phase pair ) . for @xmath64",

    "it results in the acceleration of the soliton toward the velocity of sound , i.e. , the dark component becomes continuously grayer and , eventually , the wave transforms to the ground state of the bec .",

    "the accuracy of this effective particle picture in capturing the anti - damped dynamics is shown in fig .",

    "it is important to note that , although this dynamics is similar to that of dark solitons in single becs  @xcite , the analysis of ref .",

    "these expressions , when substituted into eq .",

    "@xcite , these small - amplitude structures persist for large amplitudes and , in the presence of a parabolic trap , they perform harmonic oscillations , in a way reminiscent of the two - component case .",
    "we note in passing that similar asymptotic reductions of other multi - component gpes , have been used to construct vector soliton solutions described by integrable systems , such as the yajima - oikawa ( already mentioned above ) and the davey - stewartson ( ds ) ones  @xcite , the melnikov system  @xcite , and a coupled korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equations system  @xcite .",
    "the concept that one component acts as a potential to trap the other , is one that transcends dimensionality .",

    "( [ deq12 ] ) , a vortex ( which is a prototypical coherent structure in 2d repulsive becs  @xcite ) in component @xmath93 can play the role of a potential trapping a bright soliton in component @xmath94 .",

    "another quasi-2d state , is the ring db soliton explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . the matter - wave ring dark soliton ( rds ) , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is a 2d radial generalization of the dark soliton which , however , is generically unstable due to breakup into vortex - antivortex polygonal structures ( squares , hexagons , etc . ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the two - component setting , the rds in one component can form an effective potential that supports a bright ring soliton structure in the other component .",

    "nevertheless , the instability gives rise to states of interest in their own right , such as vortex - bright polygons and db soliton stripes .",
    "lastly , as regards the variants considered herein , when two dark solitons ( or two vortices ) trap two bright ones , one can also view the relevant molecule under a different prism , namely that of topological states in the first component forming an effective _ double - well _ potential for the second one .",
    "this perspective was used in the cases of db solitons in 1d  @xcite , and vortex - bright solitons in 2d  @xcite .",
    "importantly , given their genuine topological nature , vortices form , in a sense , a more `` robust '' double - well .",
    "namely , while this approach neglects the back - action of the bright components on the dark ones ( i.e. , this is a `` soft '' potential , rather than a hard , externally imposed , one ) , this feedback mechanism is present and is more significant in 1d than in 2d .",
    "nevertheless , in both settings , this approach enabled the observation of features associated with double - well potentials , such as symmetry - breaking bifurcations , josephson oscillations , and so - called @xmath96-states emerging from the bifurcations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this review , we examined coherent structures arising in coupled defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equations , especially so in the vicinity of the so - called manakov limit of equal self- and cross - interactions . there",
    "( but also away from that limit ) , a fundamental concept emerges , namely that a `` dark structure '' in one component ( be it a dark soliton in 1d or a vortex in 2d ) acts as a potential well for the second component .",
    "this enables the confinement therein of a bright soliton and the formation of `` dark - bright states '' .",
    "these states also persist in the presence of external ( e.g. , parabolic ) potentials , wherein they oscillate as newtonian particles .",
    "molecular states involving multiple dark - bright waves may exist for appropriate phase difference between the bright components in the homogeneous setting ( solitonic gluons ) , and in the presence of external traps .",
    "moreover , rotated versions of such dark - bright solitons also emerge in experiments , in the form of the so - called beating dark - dark solitons .",
    "additionally , variations on these themes were recognized and explored .",
    "the dark structure potential well was , for instance , recognized as possibly trapping higher - excited states .",
    "another possibility concerned the prototypical characterization of the thermal - induced dissipation , that leads to anti - damping and eventual expulsion of dark - bright solitons from trapped atomic condensates .",
    "the relevance of higher - component settings bearing spinor analogues of the considered states was also discussed . here , dark - dark - bright , or bright - bright - dark states were found via a multiscale asymptotic analysis .",
    "another equally important and experimentally tractable generalization arose in higher - dimensional settings , where vortex - bright solitons , as well as dark - bright ring solitons were presented .",
    "finally , molecular states bearing two ( or more ) dark entities were also perceived as double ( or , respectively , multi- ) well potentials , thus enabling related phenomena .",
    "we hope that it is clear that the above ideas and paradigms are powerful and broad beyond any one of the particular examples used , and could lead to a wealth of future possibilities and explorations , both in theory and experiments . as a small sample of the questions that merit future consideration , we pose the following .",
    "is it possible to identify dark - bright solitonic states ( and their variants ) in the context of the intensely studied recently spin - orbit coupled becs  ? can a quantitative understanding of the scattering of vector solitons off of gaussian barriers ( or wells ) be achieved  ?",
    "can we trap higher - excited states in higher - dimensional settings ( radial and/or azimuthally dependent ones )  ?",
    "can an analogue of dark - dark states be observed in higher - dimensions  ?",
    "what are the implications of these ideas in three - dimensional settings  ?",
