    "in the analysis of the black hole evaporation , one usually assumes that a horizon is formed in a collapse process , and examines the evaporation and entropy in the static black hole @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we try to build a self - consistent model which describes both formation and evaporation of a black hole including the back reaction from the hawking radiation .",
    "that is , we solve the semi - classical einstein equation in a self - consistent manner : @xmath2 where @xmath3 contains the contribution from both the collapsing matter and the hawking radiation . from the solution we can investigate whether a horizon and singularity are formed or not .",
    "we first consider a null shell as the collapsing matter and construct the geometry by connecting the inside flat metric and the outside outgoing vaidya metric on the shell .",
    "note that particle creation generally occurs in a time - dependent gravitational potential , and especially , the hawking radiation can appear without a horizon @xcite .",
    "we invent a formula that evaluates the energy flux of such a process .",
    "then we obtain self - consistent equations which determine time evolution of the shell and the radiation .",
    "the solution shows that the radiation stops , the horizon and singularity appear , and the black hole remains forever .",
    "next we analyze the case where a continuous null matter collapses and discuss the mechanism of the hawking radiation .",
    "it has an onion - like internal structure and evaporates gradually from the outermost part .",
    "then we write down a self - consistent stationary solution in the heat bath .",
    "it has neither a macroscopically large horizon nor singularity .",
    "we first explain the general idea for construction of a geometry which describes a black hole from formation to evaporation .",
    "next we propose a simple model .",
    "suppose that a gravitational collapse forms a schwarzschild black hole as in the left of fig.[fig : general ] .",
    "if we take time reversal , the existing black hole goes back to the flat spacetime as in the center of fig.[fig : general ] .",
    "then , if we cover the inside of the horizon and the singularity by pasting a collapsing matter , we obtain a geometry which describes both the formation and evaporation as in the right of fig.[fig : general ] .",
    "note that whether this picture is realized or not depends on the dynamics . therefore we need to make some model and solve it concretely .",
    "we will consider the following model .",
    "when we take a null shell as the collapsing matter , the inside spacetime is flat : @xmath4 as a simple model of the outside metric , we take the outgoing vaidya metric @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bondi mass and the only non - zero component of the einstein tensor is @xmath7 where the null energy condition implies @xmath8 .",
    "this is the general spherically symmetric metric which satisfies @xmath9 and @xmath10 except for @xmath11 .",
    ", where @xmath12 is the schwarzschild radius of the null shell , we can take @xmath13 because most partial waves with @xmath14 of the radiation do not go through their own centrifugal barrier in @xmath15 .",
    "next the incoming flux can be neglected there because of the boundary condition that any energy flow does not come from infinity except for the shell .",
    "furthermore if we consider only massless fields , we can assume @xmath9 because the weyl anomaly vanishes approximately in @xmath16 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the ingoing flow and @xmath18 can exist with @xmath14 , but we assume to neglect them for the simplest model . therefore we can consider the conditions . in this sense the outgoing vaidya metric represents the outgoing radiation without the gray - body factor . ]",
    "note that the coordinate @xmath19 must be the same in the both side , because it is defined as the radius of 2-sphere and there is no room to rewrite @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath21 is related to @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the locus of the null shell .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath25 is an ingoing null geodesic in the both sides .",
    "thus a simple model is given by connecting the outgoing vaidya metric and the flat metric with the null shell as in fig [ fig : vaidya ] .",
    "we call it one - shell model",
    ".     approaches its own schwarzschild radius @xmath26 exponentially . ]    here we analyze the locus of the null shell @xmath27 for a given function @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is determined by the condition : @xmath28 this equation tells that the shell will approach its own schwarzschild radius in the time scale @xmath29 if @xmath26 changes so slowly that the time scale in which @xmath26 changes significantly , @xmath30 , is much larger than @xmath12 , that is , @xmath31 then , in the region @xmath32 , we can replace @xmath25 in the denominator with @xmath12 and solve it as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a positive constant . here",
    "the term @xmath35 means that as the shell approaches to its schwarzschild radius in the time scale of @xmath36 , the radius reduces by the evaporation .",
    "( see fig  [ fig : vaidya ] . )",
    "therefore the shell can not catch up with the radius completely as long as @xmath8 , but it approaches to @xmath37    finally we investigate the surface energy - momentum tensor @xmath38 on the shell . using the barrabes - israel null - shell formalism @xcite ,  we estimate @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the four vector of an observer ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the ingoing radial null vector which is taken as @xmath43 in the vaidya metric and @xmath44 in the flat space , and @xmath45 is the metric on the 2-sphere ( @xmath46 ) . the fact that @xmath47 implies that the work done by the shell as it contracts is transformed to the hawking radiation .",
    "thus this model is consistent in energetics .",
    "time evolution of this model depends on the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so we will investigate their dynamics in the following sections .",
    "we will here construct a flux formula @xmath48 which , at @xmath49 , estimates energy flow from the black hole : @xmath50 in the heisenberg picture , we use the eikonal approximation , the point - splitting regularization and only the s - wave to obtain @xmath51\\equiv \\frac{\\hbar}{8\\pi}\\left\\{u , u\\right\\ } , \\label{j}\\ ] ] whose form is the same as the schwarzian derivative .",
    "the derivation is given in the [ sec : der_flux ] .",
    "note that we can also derive the planck distribution without horizon ( see [ sec : planck ] ) .",
    "first we test the formula in the case without back reaction , that is , in the geometry obtained by connecting the schwarzschild metric and the flat space . in this case , from , @xmath27 becomes @xmath52 where @xmath12 becomes constant completely .",
    "then the flux is estimated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "this is the same as thermal radiation from a one - dimensional black body with the temperature @xmath55 . in this sense ,",
    "the flux formula is consistent with the usual result @xcite .",
    "note that this result is the same as the stefan - boltzmann law except for the coefficient .    from , , and ,",
    "we have obtained the self - consistent equations which determine the dynamics of the one - layer model , that is , @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath56 @xmath57 , \\label{sceq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the planck length .",
    "now we consider the collapse of a null shell by using the one - shell model and investigate whether it evaporates or not . the numerical result of and",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] .     in the case of the null shell .",
    "the initial conditions are given by with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . ]    here we have chosen the initial conditions given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a number , and we assume @xmath63 .",
    "the shell does not evaporate completely , and a horizon and singularity appear .",
    "this asymptotic behavior does not depend on the detail of the initial conditions .",
    "we can understand why the radiation stops in the following manner .",
    "let s recall the estimation of the hawking radiation on the geometry with @xmath64 ( see ) . in that case",
    ", only the term proportional to @xmath65 contributes to the formula .",
    "however , now the term @xmath66 appears in @xmath25 , , and the exponential factor will damp for large @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 becomes @xmath67 asymptotically as in .",
    "because @xmath68 is at most of order @xmath69 , we can approximate @xmath70 then and can be solved as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are integration constants , and @xmath72 is small and positive . from @xmath74 corresponds to @xmath75 , so shows that @xmath26 will not necessarily vanish as @xmath76 .",
    "thus we have seen that a collapsing null shell with radius @xmath25 radiates for a while , but it stops and the radius @xmath25 almost stays at the schwarzschild radius @xmath12 .",
    "then the horizon and singularity appear .",
    "a single shell does not evaporate completely even if the back reaction from the hawking radiation is taken into account .",
    "we discuss the case where a continuous null matter collapses ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cont ] ) .    .",
    "the redshift factor is required to compare physics between different shells . ]",
    "let s consider a shell .",
    "the metric just outside the shell is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the schwarzschild radius corresponding to the total energy of the lower shells , and @xmath79 is the time coordinate for the shell .",
    "the locus of the shell @xmath80 follows @xmath81 and behaves as in the one - shell model : @xmath82 furthermore , for the shell , the flux formula holds , and we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents the energy flux measured at infinity if the shells outside did not exist .",
    "here we have introduced @xmath85 degrees of freedom . in the case of the standard model , @xmath86 in the energy region higher than the weak scale .",
    "note that introducing @xmath85 corresponds to replacing @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "we will show that the hawking radiation is emitted from each shell , but only shells near the outermost one are relevant because of the large redshift .",
    "first we introduce a notation @xmath89 which represents distance between the shell @xmath90 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath91 . here",
    "we assume that the last term in has already damped for each shell , so that we have @xmath92 then the energy flux for each shell depends only on its schwarzschild radius and does not have an explicit @xmath79-dependence : @xmath93 from , @xmath94 also becomes a function of @xmath91 : @xmath95    now we consider the junction condition of the adjacent shells . by looking at each shell from the both side ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cont ] ) , we obtain @xmath96 if @xmath97 is small , we get @xmath98 by integrating it , we obtain the redshift factor between @xmath91 and @xmath99 for finite distance : @xmath100 from this equation , the quantity @xmath101 can be rewritten as @xmath102 where and have been used .",
    "thus we have found that for each shell @xmath103 which is independent of a concrete form of @xmath104 .    on the other hand , by expressing @xmath105 in terms of @xmath106 , we can express the energy flow in as @xmath107 from and , we obtain @xmath108 by substituting and iteratively , we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 , which would be the temperature measured at infinity if the shells outside did not exist .",
    "thus , any shell can emit the hawking radiation if the shells are continuously distributed so that we can use .",
    "this result does not depend on the behaviour of the shells outside the one we are considering . from , and , @xmath111 is determined as @xmath112    by considering the outermost shell , we find that the total hawking radiation is given by @xmath113 which coincides with the result for the static schwarzschild geometry . then by applying to the outermost shell , we obtain the time evolution of the size of the black hole : @xmath114 we can also show that the energy spectrum of the radiation follows the planck distribution ( see [ sec : planck ] ) .",
    "therefore this black hole evaporates completely as is usually expected .",
    "however , our model describes how it happens more precisely .",
    "actually the black hole evaporates gradually from the outermost shell as if one peels off an onion .    here",
    "we will check that the total radiation is equal to the sum of the radiation from each shell .",
    "first let s estimate the radiation from the region between @xmath91 and @xmath115 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] .",
    "if there were no shells outside this region , the radiation is estimated as @xmath116\\left ( 1-\\frac{da}{\\rho(a ' ) }   \\right)\\\\   & = & \\frac{d f ( a ' ) } { da'}da + f(a')\\frac{da}{\\rho(a')}\\\\   & \\approx & \\frac{da}{2a'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is neglected as a higher term , and is used . by using this and the redshift factor , the sum of radiation from each layer is estimated as @xmath118 here the dominant contribution in the integration comes from the outermost thin region with a width about @xmath119 ( see ) . although each shell radiates , the outermost region gives the main contribution because of the large redshift .",
    "we consider the case that the black hole is put in the heat bath with the hawking temperature of the outermost shell for long time so that holds for each shell .",
    "it is not difficult to calculate the metric for this stationary geometry , and we obtain ( see [ sec : metric ] ) @xmath120 this expression is valid for @xmath121 and smoothly connected to the schwarzschild metric at @xmath122 .",
    "this metric does not have a horizon . here",
    "@xmath123 is the time of the flat space at infinity , which is related to the time around the origin @xmath124 as @xmath125 this means that @xmath124 is so much redshifted that @xmath124 is almost frozen from viewpoint of an observer at infinity .",
    "note that this geometry has been obtained self - consistently , so the classical limit @xmath126 does not exist .",
    "this metric does not have a large curvature compared with @xmath127 in the region @xmath128 if @xmath85 is sufficiently large , @xmath129 : @xmath130 the singularity around the origin @xmath131 is controllable in the sense that it can be removed by introducing a small shell surrounding the origin . for example , suppose a small shell with @xmath132 comes first , and next , it grows to a large size with @xmath133 in the heat bath .",
    "then the outside region @xmath134 is described as the stationary metric , while the center shell is the schwarzschild black hole with the radius @xmath135 which does not evaporate forever as in the case of the one - shell model .",
    "therefore we have a horizon and singularity around the origin , but their size is small .    here",
    "we make a comment on the weyl anomaly .",
    "the trace of the einstein tensor is given by @xmath136 because classically the energy - momentum tensor of null shells should be traceless , this should be identified with the weyl anomaly .",
    "actually , if we use the formula of the weyl anomaly for n scalar fields @xcite , we obtain @xmath137 which agrees with up to numerical coefficients .",
    "therefore the self - consistent solution obtained by the eikonal approximation already contains the effect of the weyl anomaly .",
    "we have solved the semi - classical einstein equation in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we have built a model which describes a black hole from formation to evaporation including the back reaction from the hawking radiation .",
    "we consider null matter collapse and assume that the geometry is obtained by connecting the matter region and the outgoing vaidya metric .    using the eikonal approximation , we have found a formula that gives the energy flux of the particle creation in a dynamical geometry .",
    "then we have obtained the self - consistent equations which determine time evolution of the collapsing matter and radiation .    as the first example",
    ", we have analyzed the case where a single shell collapses and solved it numerically and analytically .",
    "the shell does not evaporate completely , and a horizon and singularity appear .",
    "this is not a thermodynamic object but a stable one in the sense that it can not be formed nor evaporated adiabatically in a heat bath .",
    "next we have discussed the case where a continuous null matter collapses .",
    "then the hawking radiation occurs not only from the surface but also from the inside .",
    "however , because of the large redshift , the radiation is emitted substantially only from the region around the surface .",
    "this black hole evaporates as is usually thought .",
    "we then have put it in a heat bath and found the stationary metric .",
    "it dose not have a macroscopically large horizon or singularity . by introducing a small shell around the origin",
    ", this singularity can be controlled .",
    "the metric automatically takes into account the effect of the weyl anomaly .",
    "there remain some open problems .",
    "our stationary solution has neither horizon nor singularity , so the information inside the hole must come back after evaporation . however , we do nt understand the mechanism clearly yet . for example",
    ", suppose that we throw a newspaper into the stationary black hole described by our metric .",
    "it will behave like another null shell going to the hole as it approaches the surface .",
    "clearly its energy will be transformed into the hawking radiation by our mechanism .",
    "however , the radiation itself comes from the quantum field on the past infinity , or the vacuum .",
    "how will the information of the newspaper come back ?",
    "a clue to this problem is that we have taken the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath138 in our self - consistent equations , which might correspond to the coarse - graining procedure in the ordinary statistical mechanics .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we put our black hole in a heat bath with the temperature equal to the hawking temperature of the outermost shell , it is completely stationary . in this sense",
    ", our black hole can be regarded as a thermodynamic object having this temperature and its entropy is given by the area law .",
    "we do nt claim that the information problem is solved , but our black hole does not have a macroscopically large horizon and singularity . the small singularity around the origin would be resolved by string theory . if it is the case , the system is completely well - defined .",

    "we will here derive the flux formula by taking only the s - wave and using the eikonal approximation . from and , we estimate @xmath139 at @xmath49 in the one - shell model ( see fig .",

    "<S> we construct a self - consistent model which describes a black hole from formation to evaporation including the back reaction from the hawking radiation . in the case where a null shell collapses , at the beginning the evaporation occurs , but it stops eventually , and a horizon and singularity appear . on the other hand , in the generic collapse process of a continuously distributed null matter , the black hole evaporates completely without forming a macroscopically large horizon nor singularity . we also find a stationary solution in the heat bath , which can be regarded as a normal thermodynamic object .    </S>",
