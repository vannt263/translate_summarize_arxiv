    "in the past decade many new , narrow states have been observed in the charmonium and bottomonium mass regions , which do not fit into a spectroscopical scheme as predicted by a static quark - antiquark potential model  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3  @xcite , for example , is found very narrow and close to the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "recently the quantum numbers have been determined to @xmath5 by lhcb  @xcite . however , its nature is not understood , yet .",
    "the @xmath6  @xcite is found far above the open - charm thresholds ; however no decay into @xmath7 has been observed so far .",
    "therefore it is being discussed e.g. as a possible hybrid with gluonic excitation .",
    "@xmath8 states have raised attention after the discovery of the @xmath9  @xcite , because many of those @xmath8 states are charged , which is in contradiction to conventional charmonium , inevitably being neutral . in the past 2 years several resonant structures , namely the @xmath10  @xcite , the @xmath11  @xcite , the @xmath12  @xcite , and the @xmath13  @xcite , have been observed .",
    "their nature is still unclear .",
    "the transition @xmath14 has been seen by bes iii  @xcite ; the transition @xmath15 has also been seen  @xcite . but no experiment until now looked for the transition @xmath16 , or vice versa . some z states are observed decaying to @xmath4 or @xmath17 .",
    "the mass values of the @xmath12 , the @xmath10 , and the @xmath11 , published by besiii , are close to the @xmath4 and @xmath17 thresholds , respectively . assuming that the z states contain s - wave @xmath4 and @xmath17 components",
    ", the spin parity j@xmath18of the @xmath12 and the @xmath10 would be j@xmath18= @xmath19 , and the spin parity of the @xmath11 is expected to be j@xmath18=@xmath20 , @xmath19 , or @xmath21 .",
    "the former is confirmed by besiii experimental data .",
    "one can expect also similar s - wave resonances in the @xmath22 system , with j@xmath18= @xmath20 ( c=+1 for the neutral state ) , and mass values about 3730 mev / c@xmath23 , which are not observed yet .    in this context",
    ", the contribution of a @xmath24 machine has to be considered as essential , because it can either confirm the above bes iii measurements , and look for the non - observed @xmath20 z states at the @xmath22 threshold , as @xmath24 annihilation is a gluon rich process with direct access to various quantum numbers in production processes .",
    "in addition , the possibility of f - wave charmonium state search has been explored , as a test of flavor independence to understand the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "the future @xmath0  experiment at fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) is well suited for charmonium studies , thanks to the high capability rate and the excellent mass resolution , that allows high precision measurements and energy scan .",
    "the experimental setup is described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking advantages of the @xmath0  experiment is the opportunity to search for direct production of exotic resonant states with various quantum numbers , including charged ones in @xmath25 collisions . in @xmath26 experiments",
    "only neutral @xmath27 resonances can be directly produced , and production of exotic charmed states through other mechanisms is suppressed .    using the detailed balance method , we can evaluate the cross section as :    @xmath28 \\cdot br ( r \\rightarrow f )   = \\frac{(2j + 1 ) \\cdot 4\\pi}{s- 4m^2_p}\\cdot \\frac { br ( r \\rightarrow \\bar p p ) \\cdot br ( r \\rightarrow f ) \\cdot \\gamma^2_{r}}{4(\\sqrt s -m_{r})^2 + \\gamma^2_{r}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the final state of the decay channel , @xmath30 is the total width of a resonance @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the center of mass energy . for example , in order to evaluate the cross section of the process @xmath33 , we make use of the equation  ( [ formula1 ] ) , and obtain :    @xmath34 \\cdot br(x(3872 ) \\rightarrow f ) = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4\\pi}{s- 4m^2_p}\\cdot \\frac{br(x(3872 ) \\rightarrow \\bar p p ) \\cdot br(x(3872 ) \\rightarrow f ) \\cdot \\gamma^2_{x(3872)}}{4(\\sqrt s -m_{x(3872)})^2 + \\gamma^2_{x(3872 ) } } . \\\\\\ ] ]    we know that the spin parity of the @xmath3 is j@xmath35 = 1@xmath36 . we assume here a non - polarized incident beam .",
    "down below we will use the decay channel @xmath37/@xmath38@xmath39 as @xmath29 for the case of the @xmath3 .",
    "if we run at @xmath32 = @xmath40 = 3.872 gev / c@xmath41 the equation  ( [ formula1_x3872 ] ) simplifies : @xmath42 = \\frac{3\\cdot 4\\pi}{m^{2}_{x(3872)}- 4m^2_p}\\cdot br(x(3872 ) \\rightarrow \\bar p p)$ ] .",
    "here we assume c = @xmath43 = 1 .",
    "the @xmath44 , then , enters the formula of equation  ( [ formula1_x3872 ] ) .",
    "we estimate it from the available experimental measurements in the pdg  @xcite , and those published by the lhcb experiment  @xcite . the combination of both leads to an upper limit at 95@xmath45 confidence level ( c.l . ) : @xmath46 ( 68 @xmath47 0.4 ) nb . in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite , a reasonable number for the upper limit of the cross section @xmath48(@xmath33 ) = 50 nb .",
    "therefore , in @xmath0  we use to evaluate the expected @xmath3 yield by using the above cross section estimate .",
    "this value should be interpreted as an upper limit . a lower limit estimate to the @xmath3 cross section",
    "can not be quoted yet , simply because its very narrow width leads to unreasonable lower limits , by using standard methods for cross section evaluations .",
    "@xmath0  could start in different operation modes , involving different antiproton beam resolution and luminosity values .",
    "assuming the @xmath3 cross section in @xmath24 annihilation equal to 50 nb  @xcite , we are expected to produce 432000 @xmath3 per day in high luminosity mode ( average luminosity @xmath49 = 10@xmath50 @xmath51 s@xmath52 ) , and 43200 @xmath3 per day in high resolution mode ( average luminosity @xmath53 = 10@xmath54 @xmath51 s@xmath52 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0  can be considered as a  mini-@xmath3 factory  . in the latter situation , the mass scan in 100-kev - steps , that is needed to measure the @xmath3 width ,",
    "can be performed in about 3 weeks , collecting 15 points above and below the mass threshold , as detailed explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in high resolution mode , @xmath0",
    "is designed to have @xmath55 = 5 @xmath56 .",
    "we calculate the number of produced @xmath6 by multiplying the expected luminosity and the cross section of the process @xmath57 .",
    "we assume @xmath58 = 100@xmath45 , for four reasons :    * the decay @xmath59 was the discovery mode @xcite ; * for all known @xmath6 decay channels , the pdg  @xcite quotes `` seen '' with no numbers reported ; * all searches for decays to open charm performed at b factories , in isr and b decay modes , lead to upper limits only . in the pdg",
    "@xcite , these upper limits are all normalized to the br(@xmath59 )  @xcite ; * recently , the besiii experiment published the observation of the transition @xmath60  @xcite , from which it can be concluded that the @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , contributes in negligible way to the total @xmath63 , i.e.   @xmath640.5@xmath45 only .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath57 can be estimated using detailed balance ( equation  ( [ formula1 ] ) ) . however , if the poorly known upper limit @xmath650.13 at 90@xmath45 c.l .",
    "@xcite is taken as estimate and inserted into equation  ( [ formula1 ] ) , it leads to an unrealistically high cross section estimate of 4370 nb .",
    "if the br of a resonant state , decaying to @xmath24 , is known , we can directly apply the detailed balance method to evaluate the cross section .",
    "however , if this br is not known , at first we use the ansatz that partial width is identical for states @xmath66 , @xmath67 of the same quantum number  @xcite .",
    "@xmath68    this method assumes that the partial widths @xmath69 of all charmonium states are identical , where @xmath31 refers to the state .",
    "although we might have indication that the @xmath6 is not a charmonium state , no model exists to evaluate the cross section for exotic states . in absence of any explanation of the @xmath6 nature , thus we perform our calculation under the naive assumption that it is a charmonium state . as a reference state for the @xmath6 estimates , we choose the @xmath70 , for which the following numbers have been recently measured  @xcite : @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "we start our calculation from equation  ( [ escaling ] ) , using @xmath38(3770 ) as a reference , and obtain :    @xmath73    we can write again equation  ( [ myscaling ] ) , using the detailed balance principle , as :    @xmath74    we assume the cross section of equation  ( [ my2 ] ) as an upper limit . in order to estimate a lower limit for the cross section @xmath24@xmath75@xmath6 , we use the assumption that the annihilation part , which manifests in the decay into @xmath76 and the decay into @xmath24 , are identical :    @xmath77    this result is obtained by using the partial width @xmath78(@xmath6 ) and @xmath79 from pdg  @xcite , and @xmath80(@xmath81 ) from ref .  @xcite . as a word of caution ,",
    "the scaling in equation  ( [ myscaling ] ) is only an approximation as well , as @xmath82 and @xmath83 are point - like particles , but @xmath84 and @xmath85 are not . when scaling the partial width @xmath69 ( or the branching fraction @xmath86 ) for a decay to @xmath24 of a resonance @xmath31=@xmath66 with a mass @xmath87 to another resonance @xmath31=@xmath67 with a mass @xmath88",
    ", one would have to take into account , that the proton formfactor @xmath89 has an energy dependence @xmath89(@xmath90 ) and is changing from @xmath90=@xmath87 to @xmath90=@xmath88 .",
    "however , we do not have to apply this correction here for the evaluation of the lower cross section limit for the @xmath6 , as the formfactor is already implicitely included in the measured @xmath91 ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath92 could be compared to the cross section @xmath93=(62.9 @xmath47 1.9 ) pb  @xcite . for the case of the above upper limit",
    ", the cross section in the @xmath24 process is a factor of about 35 larger than the cross section measured in @xmath76 collisions .",
    "the number of expected @xmath10 events in @xmath0  can be estimated from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite : in the decay @xmath94 the besiii experiment observed the @xmath10  @xcite , using the full dataset collected near the @xmath6 energy .",
    "the observed @xmath10 yield is 307 , and the ratio @xmath95    all measurements are based on 1.9 fb@xmath96 , which is presently the world largest dataset collected at the @xmath6 energy .",
    "we can extrapolate how many produced @xmath10 are expected at @xmath0 , assuming that [ 66@xmath971900 ] @xmath6 states are expected to be produced per day in high resolution mode .",
    "the calculation is based upon the cross section range [ 77@xmath972200 ] pb , as stated in the previous section .",
    "for the upper limit evaluation we find :    @xmath98    for the lower limit evaluation we find :    @xmath99    based on these estimates , we would be able to produce [ 14@xmath97405 ] @xmath10 events / day in high resolution mode , when running at a center - of - mass energy for @xmath6 peak resonance production .",
    "we note that of course there can be non - resonant production @xmath100 at the same energy , and the according non - resonant cross section can be even larger than the resonant cross section , although the indication from besiii and the isr measurements at the b factories is that non - resonant @xmath101 is small ( @xmath102@xmath10310% ) .",
    "observations of transitions of x , y and z states are very important for understanding the spectroscopical pattern , and possibly conclude similarities in the nature of these states .",
    "two recent besiii publications connect the @xmath3 to the @xmath6  @xcite , and the @xmath6 to the @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "however , up to now , no experimental measurement connects the @xmath3 to the z structures .",
    "thus , we propose to search for the transitions x to z ( or z to x ) .",
    "@xmath0  would be well suited for this search because of the following reasons :    * about possible z to x transitions , the decay @xmath105 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "the decay @xmath106 is allowed , however suppressed as a p - wave decay close to threshold , since both the @xmath3 and the @xmath107 have positive parity ( assuming s - wave @xmath108 content of the @xmath107 ) .",
    "two pion transitions between the @xmath107 and the @xmath3 would go in s - wave , but they are kinematically forbidden ; * @xmath109 is allowed , but no signal for the @xmath107 was observed in the investigation of the according final state in searches for the charged partner of the @xmath3 at babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite ; * @xmath0  will collect a data set of @xmath3 ( see above ) , with a statistics larger than other experiments by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , rare decays of the x(3872 ) , e.g. isospin forbidden decays or radiative decays , become accessible ; * as the @xmath110 was observed in close vicinity of the @xmath111@xmath112 threshold , and the @xmath107 was observed in close vicinity of the @xmath112@xmath113 threshold , it is intriguing to assume the existance of another yet unboserved @xmath114 in close vicinity of the @xmath115@xmath111 threshold . assuming s - wave ,",
    "this state would have @xmath116=@xmath20 , and thus it cannnot decay to @xmath37/@xmath38@xmath117 due to parity conservation .",
    "in fact , neither charged or neutral structure have been observed around this mass in this final state . using the future @xmath3 data sample at @xmath0",
    ", @xmath118 represents a candidate decay channel .",
    "the latter decay is suppressed due to isospin violation ; however , isospin violating decays of the @xmath3 , such as @xmath3@xmath75@xmath37/@xmath38@xmath119 , have been observed with significant branching fractions .",
    "in addition , the requirement of a @xmath37/@xmath38 in the final state provides a tool to reduce the hadronic background at @xmath0 .",
    "simulations performed at the @xmath3 energy scan have already shown that the ratio signal over background is 6:1  @xcite ; therefore , a favorable ratio s / b is expected also for the search of the @xmath114 resonant structures ; * due to the observation of the @xmath120 and the @xmath121 , @xmath122 states have been interpreted as isospin triplets with charged and neutral partners at the same mass .",
    "thus , we may search for the @xmath123 , which could be reconstructed from @xmath124 and @xmath125 decays .",
    "in fact , in these transitions the parity flips from j@xmath126 = 1@xmath36 ( the @xmath3 ) to j@xmath127 = 0@xmath36@xmath10@xmath128 .",
    "although radiative decays are suppressed by @xmath129/@xmath117 , the observation of this decay would be of very high importance , as it would provide a way to measure the c - parity of the @xmath123 ; * in an additional stage , we could also search for the charged @xmath130 candidate , decaying to @xmath131 , with subsequent @xmath132 and @xmath133 leptons ( with l=1 ) .",
    "investigation of other final states , e.g. @xmath134@xmath111@xmath135 in e.g.  @xmath84@xmath136@xmath75@xmath111@xmath135@xmath117 are also possible , but would suffer of higher background .",
    "again , it should be noted that a dedicated data taking run at the center of mass energy of @xmath114 is not required for the proposed study .",
    "to summarize , @xmath0  would be unique to search for @xmath137 transitions involving yet unobserved neutral and charged @xmath114 states in the processes :    * @xmath138 , @xmath139 , with @xmath133 leptons and @xmath140 ; + * @xmath138 , @xmath141 , with @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath133 leptons ; + * @xmath144 , @xmath145 , with @xmath146 and @xmath133 leptons .",
    "we also note , that the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 have not been observed in @xmath147 decays , yet .",
    "thus , we expect high discovery potential for @xmath0 .",
    "a unique feature for @xmath0  can be the search for high spin states . based on theoretical predictions as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we simulated the multiple radiative cascade @xmath148 , as detailed reported in ref .",
    "@xmath0  is designed to perform an excellent photon reconstruction , and our simulations have already demonstrated that physics channels reconstructed from one @xmath149 and three @xmath150 have clear signature , and a background suppression factor of about 10@xmath151  @xcite .",
    "the static heavy quark anti - quark ( @xmath152 ) potential of the cornell - type  @xcite can be expressed by @xmath153 , with a chromo - electric coulomb - type term , and a linear confinement term .",
    "it predicts many of the experimentally observed charmonium and bottomonium states up to a precision of @xmath1541 mev .",
    "recently several new states have been observed , which fit well into the prediction of the cornell - type potential , i.e. the @xmath155 , the @xmath156 and the @xmath157 , or @xmath158 and @xmath159 . by the mass measurements of these new states , a comparison of the level spacings between charmonium ( mass region 3 - 4 gev/@xmath160 ) and bottomonium ( mass region 9 - 10 gev/@xmath160 ) became available for the first time .",
    "for example , the following spin - averaged mass differences :    @xmath161    @xmath162    are identical to a level of better than 10@xmath163 , which is quite surprising and points to flavor independence of the quark anti - quark potential . in other words , the potential does not seem to depend on the different quark mass of the charm or the bottom quark , although in the cornell potential the quark mass is explicitly one of the adjustable parameters .    -0.2 cm    lrccccl resonance & @xmath53 = 8.64 @xmath164 & @xmath53= 0.864 @xmath164 & @xmath53= 0.432 @xmath164 @xmath3 & 432000 & 43200 & 21600 @xmath6 & 19000 ( 665)&1900 ( 67 ) & 950 ( 7 ) @xmath165 & 4050 ( 140 ) &  405 ( 14)&202 ( 7 )    however , as already found in the 1970 s  @xcite , flavor independence is not fulfilled for a cornell - type potential .",
    "potentials , for which identical level spacings for charmonium and bottomonium are fulfilled , are logarithmic potentials of the type @xmath166 .",
    "one of the important tasks of future experiments such as @xmath0  is the search for additional , yet unobserved states ( e.g. the @xmath167 or @xmath168 state ) , which could be used to obtain additional level spacings and further test the flavor indepedence , and possibly a logarithmic shape of the potential . simulations in this sense were performed with the @xmath0  full reconstruction framework  @xcite , and they are promising , as detailed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in summary , table  [ table2 ] reports our estimates for x , y , z production rates at @xmath0 , assuming different luminosity average values @xmath169",
    "= 10@xmath50 @xmath170s@xmath96 , @xmath169 = 10@xmath54 @xmath170s@xmath96 , and @xmath169 = 0.5@xmath110@xmath54 @xmath170s@xmath96 , respectively .",
    "rates must be interpreted as educated guess , due to the @xmath24 cross sections , which have not been measured , yet .",
    "the expected large statistics at @xmath0  will help to address many open questions about x , y , and z states , in order to unravel their nature . a high discovery potential exists , in particular for new states with quantum numbers unobservable in production processes at other experimental facilities ."
