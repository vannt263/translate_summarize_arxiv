    ", we investigated what can be inferred about the solar core from @xmath0-mode detection .",
    "to estimate what specific information on the core rotation is added by @xmath0 modes , modes for which we have today candidates and that are likely to be unequivocally observed in the future , we used here an inversion code based on the regularized least square methodology ( eff - darwich & prez - hernandez 1997 ) .",
    "we created an artificial rotational profile , which is a step - like profile ( see fig.[ginversion ] ) . from this profile , we calculated artificial splittings and we inverted them after attributing them observational error bars .",
    "we have considered two sets of @xmath0 modes : one with the current @xmath0-mode candidate ( d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 ) and another one with 8 low - degree @xmath0 modes ( @xmath7 = 1 , @xmath8 = -2 to -5 and @xmath7 = 2 , @xmath8 = -3 to -6 ) ( d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 ) , and for both cases uncertainties values of 75 ( d@xmath5 and d@xmath9 ) and 7.5 nhz ( d@xmath6 and d@xmath10 ) .",

    "[ ginversion ] shows that with one @xmath0 mode and a very large error bar , we do not have any information on the behavior of the rotation in the solar core .",
    "then , either by increasing the number of modes or by decreasing the error bars , we start to have some indication of the actual simulated rotation rate in the core . however , such small amount of modes is not enough to reconstruct the profile .",
    "we only have one or two points below 0.1r@xmath2 in the inversion .",
    "we need more @xmath0 modes to constrain the profile at these depths . for the region between 0.1 and 0.2 r@xmath2 ,",
    "low - degree high - frequency @xmath1 modes are needed as their inner turning points are in this region .",
    "modes and adding the @xmath0-mode candidate ( from mathur et al .",
    "2008).,width=302 ]    then , we applied the inversion to real data using only @xmath1 modes and also adding the @xmath0-mode candidate with the previous values of uncertainty .",
    "as different scenarios were proposed to explain this candidate , two values of splitting have been used : 300 and 600 nhz .",
    "whatever the value of the splittings is , the result is stable and we have the same behavior down to 0.2r@xmath2 . if we take into account the error bars , the rotation is well defined down to 0.17r@xmath2 .",
    "however , the rotation profile below this radius can not be determined as long as we do not detect several @xmath0 modes individually .",
    "in this section , we tried to see how the detection of asymptotic properties could provide us some information on a few physical inputs in solar models . we know that @xmath0-mode periods are periodically spaced in the power spectrum density ( psd ) .",
    "the fourier transform of this psd ( ps2 ) has a large peak ( @xmath11 for the modes @xmath7=1 ) corresponding to this periodicity ( see for example garca et al .",
    "2008c ) . using the same methodology as the one developed in garca et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we applied it to seven solar models with different physical inputs . depending on the models used , @xmath0-mode frequencies can vary up to 5@xmath3hz .",
    "this information can not be used as long as @xmath0 modes are not detected individually .",
    "but the asymptotic value of @xmath11 is within a one - minute range depending on the physical input of the model ( mathur et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the method consists in filtering only the region delimited by the peaks of the @xmath11 and its first harmonic in the ps2 ( fig .",
    "[ recons ] left ) so that we can reconstruct the signal corresponding to this region of the spectrum .",
    "this method is very powerful as it reconstructs the components of the modes ( fig .",
    "[ recons ] right ) and it is sensitive to the rotation . indeed , in the ps2 , we can not distinguish between a model with a solid rotation and a model with a core rotating faster than the rest of the radiative zone .",
    "thus , as well as testing the dynamics of the core , we can check the sensitivity to some physical processes .",
    "two parameters are used : the physical input such as the chemical composition , the microscopic diffusion or the diffusion in the tachocline , and the rotation profile which is a step - like profile with different values of rotation rate in the core .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     once we have reconstructed the signal corresponding to different solar models and to the golf data , we calculate the correlation rate between these models and the data . fig .",
    "[ corr_rate ] shows the correlation rates for the seven models as a function of the rotation profile . for a given rotation profile",
    ", two groups can be distinguished : the first one with higher correlation rates for the models using the old abundances of grevesse et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and another group of models with the abundances of asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with very low correlation rates ( even negative ) and the model without microscopics diffusion .",
    "thus , golf data are more compatible with models s , and with the old abundances than the other models .",
    "then , a rotation profile with a high rate from 3 to 5 times the rate in the rest of the radiative zone gives higher correlation rates .",
    "on one hand , a theoretical work was carried to see how individual @xmath0-mode detection could improve our knowledge on the rotation of the solar core .",
    "we showed that with one or a few @xmath0 modes , we can have some information on the rotation rate in the core .",
    "but to better reconstruct the rotation profile in the core , we need more modes . on the other hand , we used the detection of asymptotic properties to extract information on the structure of solar models .",
    "the methodology used is sensitive to the structure for a few models and also to the rotation profile .",
    "moreover , the results obtained are in agreement with @xmath1-mode results as golf data are more compatible with standard models using old abundances",
    ". we still have to keep in mind that these standard models are not complete and the discrepancy is not necessarily related to the abundances themselves .",
    "however , to improve our knowledge on the solar burning core , we need to detect these @xmath0 modes : individually , we would be able to constrain the dynamics and globally , we would have some constraints on physical inputs ."
