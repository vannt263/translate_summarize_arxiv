    "theories with weak scale supersymmetry represent the most complete and cherished vision of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "their many successes include stabilization of the electroweak scale with respect to high - scale physics , improvement of the convergence of couplings necessary for grand unification , possible electroweak baryogenesis to explain the matter - anti - matter asymmetry of the universe , and ( with @xmath0 parity ) relatively mild contributions to precision electroweak data and a successful dark matter candidate .",
    "however , none of those successes rest crucially on the minimal realization of the supersymmetric standard model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are features of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which are somewhat at odds with the mssm as a completely natural theory of the electroweak scale . the @xmath1 or @xmath2 problem indicates that the supersymmetric @xmath1 term must be roughly of the same size as the supersymmetry - breaking parameters , and yet the mssm offers no explanation for why this should be the case .",
    "the lightest higgs mass in the mssm is , at tree - level , less than the @xmath3 boson mass , and even including radiative corrections typically in conflict with the lep - ii bound  @xcite .",
    "the model survives based on large radiative corrections from scalar top quarks , but in turn this requires the stops to be so heavy that the higgs soft masses end up fine - tuned to the per - cent level .",
    "perhaps the most disturbing feature of the mssm is the fact that if one naively assumes a general spectrum of supersymmetry - breaking parameters , it is simply ruled out .",
    "if there are large mixings among the squarks and among the sleptons , flavor - violating processes such as @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing , @xmath6 , and others , can be enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to standard model predictions , in obvious contradiction to experimental data .",
    "the traditional solution ( of which gauge mediation is the prototype ) is to engineer supersymmetry breaking such that the soft - breaking mass parameters are highly flavor diagonal  @xcite .",
    "this controls flavor violation to an acceptable level at a given energy scale , but continues to be challenged by natural electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs mass , and cosmology .",
    "an alternative is to alter the low energy structure of the model such that the supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem is preserved , but flavor violation is ameliorated .",
    "a recent elegant solution imposes a continuous @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite , to form the minimal @xmath0-symmetric supersymmetric standard model ( mrssm )  @xcite .",
    "this model invokes the @xmath0 symmetry to forbid the potentially flavor - violating left - right mixing @xmath7-terms , and to guarantee ( at least largely in light of anomaly - mediated contributions ) dirac gaugino masses .",
    "this dirac nature often leads to an additional suppression in flavor - violating processes from gauginos running in the loops , which causes many contributions to scale with large gaugino mass as @xmath8 instead of the majorana scaling , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the model has additional interesting features , such as uv finite scalar masses due to the super - soft feature of dirac gauginos  @xcite , and additional matter content at the electroweak scale .",
    "for example , if the gluino is a dirac particle , the two on - shell degrees of freedom from the gluon are not sufficient to construct a supersymmetric four - spinor .",
    "to provide the two additional bosonic degrees of freedom , the mrssm adds a complex scalar partner .",
    "an unbroken @xmath0 symmetry is also a generic feature of simple models of meta - stable supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider the phenomenology of the scalar partner of the dirac gluino , a color adjoint scalar  the sgluon . as a colored particle , it couples to a gluon and",
    "will have large pair - production rates at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "it interacts with quarks at the one - loop level proportional to the quark masses .",
    "thanks to the large mixing naturally expected in the mrssm s squark sector , it will readily decay into flavor violating channels .",
    "previous studies have considered scalar color octets with either decays into missing energy  @xcite , with electroweak as well as @xmath10 charges  @xcite , or purely flavor diagonal couplings  @xcite , which all lead to very different phenomena .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sgluons ] we show how sgluons arise in a model with dirac gluinos , examine their soft masses , and derive their interactions including the one - loop contribution to the @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath11@xmath14@xmath14 vertices . in section  [ sec : fcnc ] we examine the flavor - violating effects mediated by sgluons and derive some mild constraints from @xmath4-@xmath15 mixing . in section",
    "[ sec : search ] we discuss the production of a pair of sgluons through the strong interaction , and examine the decay of the pair into like - sign tops .",
    "this distinctive signature provides bounds on the sgluon mass at the tevatron and will easily be discovered at the lhc for a wide range of masses .",
    "we particularly focus on the proper treatment of the jet activity in such events .",
    "scalar gluons are contained in a chiral superfield @xmath16 which is a color adjoint carrying @xmath0 charge zero .",

    "there are no renormalizable gauge invariant terms through which @xmath21 interacts with matter superfields in either the khler potential or in the super - potential , and the assumed @xmath0 symmetry is incompatible with @xmath31 or @xmath32 interactions in the super - potential .",

    "soft mass terms for the sgluons can arise from either @xmath37term ( @xmath38 ) or @xmath18term ( @xmath39 ) spurions of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath40 and also are generated by the term responsible for the dirac gluino mass  @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the usual superfield @xmath24 field strength .",

    "when we write @xmath52 in terms of its phase @xmath57 , the mass eigenstates are @xmath58 for simplicity we will assume @xmath59 and @xmath52 are real , and thus there is no non - trivial mixing from here on . in that case",
    "both sgluons are either a pure scalar or a pure pseudoscalar , which is equivalent as long as we combine them with massless qcd , the theory relevant for lhc .",
    "all tree - level interactions of the sgluon with standard model and mssm states we can read off @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "when we increase the minimum @xmath133 to 50  gev the typical number of additional jets drops by roughly one , but in particularly heavy states still come with zero , one , or two jets at roughly the same rate .",
    "only the three additional jets channel is suppressed to the 10% level , where this quantitative result should be taken with a grain of salt without a tuned parton shower for the lhc .",

    "secondly , as long as we require @xmath134  gev for the decay jets , even a 600  gev sgluon will hardly come with such hard qcd jets .",
    "in general , if we consider something like the total visible mass as an observable to distinguish the sgluon - pair signal from top pairs , fig .  [",
    "fig : jets ] shows that qcd radiation will improve this handle .",
    "based on these results , we can estimate that for sgluon branching ratios into @xmath135 of order 10% , we can expect an lhc discovery reach of up to roughly @xmath136  tev .",
    "the bad news is that for the reconstruction of the sgluon mass we could utilize the semileptonic sample . from fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] we can guess that the jet from the hadronic top decay should be comparable to the lepton spectrum , which does not guarantee that both of them even lie above @xmath137  gev , where the safe region would really only start at @xmath134  gev , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : jets ] . reconstructing the sgluon including a hadronic top decay is unlikely to succeed in a realistic qcd environment . as mentioned above",
    ", single sgluon production might rely on such a reconstruction for a side - bin analysis against the theoretically notorious single - top background , so qcd effects are unlikely to help with this problem .",
    "the mrssm , with a continuous @xmath0 symmetry , is an interesting alternative to the mssm , which provides a novel solution to the tension between supersymmetry at the tev scale and measurements from the flavor sector .",
    "a key feature of any @xmath0symmetric model is the promotion of gauginos to dirac fermions , which automatically implies the existence of an additional color - octet scalar with standard - model type @xmath0 charge , the sgluon .",
    "sgluons necessarily have tree - level couplings to gluons , gluinos , and squarks , which further induce couplings to quarks and ( single sgluon coupling to ) gluons through loops .",
    "sgluons have a large color charge and can be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "their decays can include squarks , gluinos , gluons , and quarks .",
    "this last decay , through the large squark mixing which is the hallmark of the mrssm , can violate flavor , leading to large branching ratios into a top and a light quark .",
    "pair production with a subsequent decay to light - sign top quarks appears to be the most promising search channel at the lhc .",
    "we have computed the relevant lhc cross sections and branching ratios , with special focus on jet activity in this essentially background - free signature .",
    "properly simulated qcd effects turn out to be helpful with regard to the sgluon pair analysis : additional jet radiation in the signal will typically create more hard jets , adding to the two hard decay jets from the sgluon pair . while the qcd jets are too soft to be mistaken for decay jets they create a generally harder signal event , while jet radiation for the already softer top - pair background makes this general feature even more prominent . in the light of this result",
    ", a search for sgluon pairs with a @xmath108 final state might be feasible .    for single sgluon production",
    "the qcd - induced background uncertainty is potentially dangerous . the obvious way to tell apart signal and background would be to look for a peak in the top ",
    "jet invariant mass , with a hadronically decaying top quark .",
    "however , qcd jet radiation can be expected to lead to a sizeable combinatorical background to the @xmath128 decay jets , which is worsened by the generically higher scale of the signal process .",
    "the authors are grateful for conversations with beate heinemann , ben kilminster , charles plager , dave rainwater , and daniel whiteson . for the qcd simulations we are hugely grateful to johan alwall for teaching us madevent and jet merging .",
    "we also would like to thank the aspen center for physics for providing such a stimulating environment which inspired this study .",
    "we thank claude duhr and fabio maltoni for helping us implement the correct color structure for the @xmath11-@xmath11-@xmath14-@xmath14 vertex in madevent , which is not properly gauge invariant by default .",
    "we are grateful to the authors of @xcite for detailed comparisons with part of our results and correcting a sign error in our original feynman rules .",
    "our phenomenological results have not changed significantly .",

    "in this appendix , we present the expressions for sgluon coupling to quarks and gluons induced at one loop . the results are presented in terms of the scalar integral functions of passarino and veltman  @xcite , normalized such that the measure is @xmath138 .",
    "the sgluon coupling to quark @xmath139 and anti - quark @xmath140 receives contributions from both right- and left - handed squarks . in the mrssm , right- and left - handed squarks do not mix with each other , so even with large squark mixing , they form two distinct sectors .",
