    "since many years random ising models have served as paradigmatic systems in which the influence of quenched disorder may be studied through different techniques . in the present work we report results obtained by high - temperature series expansions .",
    "systematic series expansions @xcite for statistical physics models defined on a lattice provide an useful complement to field - theoretical renormalization group studies and large - scale numerical monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is in particular true when studying phase transitions and critical phenomena of quenched , disordered systems .",
    "series expansions techniques treat the quenched disorder average exactly and the infinite - volume limit is implicitly implied .",
    "therefore one can obtain exact results up to a certain order in the inverse temperature for many quantities .",
    "moreover , one can keep the disorder strength @xmath3 as well as the dimension @xmath4 as symbolic parameters and therefore analyse large regions of the parameter space of disordered systems .",
    "the critical part of the series expansion approach lies in the extrapolation techniques which are used in order to obtain information on the phase transition behaviour from the finite number of known coefficients .",
    "while for pure systems this usually works quite well , one can question the use of these extrapolation techniques in disordered systems , where the singularity structure of the free energy or susceptibility may be very complicated , involving griffiths - type singularities or logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "yet our work indicates that at least for the model we consider here , the extrapolation techniques are of comparable quality as for the case of the pure ( no disorder ) ising model .",
    "we consider in this paper the ising model on a hypercubic @xmath4-dimensional lattice @xmath5 with bond dilution as a realization of quenched and uncorrelated disorder .",
    "the pure model has a second - order phase transition for @xmath6 , and the upper critical dimension , where mean - field behaviour sets in , is @xmath7 .",
    "the influence of quenched disorder can be estimated by the harris criterion @xcite : for @xmath8 , the disorder is expected to change only non - universal quantities such as the transition temperature @xmath9 . at the upper critical dimension @xmath10 , logarithmic or even more subtle correction terms",
    "should appear , and in @xmath11 , the phase transition of the disordered system should be governed by a new `` random '' fixed point since for the pure model the critical exponent @xmath12 of the specific heat is positive and disorder should hence be a relevant perturbation .",
    "our high - temperature series analyses presented in this paper affirm this picture .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ model ] we first briefly recall the model and some of its properties .",

    "the expansion parameter for averaged quantities is usually taken as @xmath24 .",
    "the pure ( @xmath23 ) model has for @xmath6 a second - order phase transition from the disordered high - temperature phase to a ferromagnetic low - temperature phase .",
    "bond dilution decreases @xmath9 . approaching the geometric bond percolation threshold @xmath25 the critical temperature decreases to zero ( @xmath26 ) since above this value only finite clusters of bonds are present and therefore no global ferromagnetic order is possible .",

    "the influence of quenched disorder on the thermal fixed point is different above and below the upper critical dimension @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 the pure fixed point is , according to the harris criterion @xcite , stable against the influence of disorder and one expects that the renormalization group ( rg ) flow goes along the critical line from the unstable percolation fixed point straight to the stable pure fixed point .",
    "the critical behaviour along this line of phase transitions is governed by the pure fixed point .",
    "for @xmath11 the pure fixed point is unstable and one expects a new random fixed point governing the critical behaviour in the region @xmath29 , attracting rg flow from both sides ( pure and percolation fixed point ) .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath10 random disorder changes the form of the logarithmic corrections to the gaussian fixed point @xcite , whereas for @xmath30 gaussian behaviour is expected for @xmath23 and @xmath31 as well .",

    "( [ eq : sg1 ] ) important for us is that the quenched disorder average can be calculated on the level of single graphs as long as the disorder is uncorrelated .",

    "this is in contrast to the free embeddings used in linked - cluster expansions . here",
    ", different vertices and bonds of the graph may correspond to the same vertex or bond of the lattice . therefore in order to calculate the disorder average one has to classify the free embeddings of a graph according to their correspondence to embeddings of a collapsed graph ( where some edges of @xmath41 are identified ) .",

    "e.g. , the finite lattice method which holds the world record for the pure 3d ising model @xcite or methods using schwinger - dyson equations @xcite , no practical generalization to disordered systems is known .    for the generation of graphs we employed the ` n`auty package by mckay @xcite which makes very fast isomorphism tests by calculating a canonical representation of the automorphism group of the graphs . by this means",
    ", we classified all star graphs up to order 21 that can be embedded in hypercubic lattices , see table  [ tab:1 ] .",
