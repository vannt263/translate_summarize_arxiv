    "new precise observations can reveal the origin of the accelerating universe : specifically , to determine if cosmic acceleration is caused by deviations of general relativity ( gr ) on the large scales or by a new form of energy ( i.e. , so - called dark energy ) .",
    "it is possible to break the degeneracy between scenarios of acceleration that require dark energy components and those that require modifications to gr by independently explore both the cosmic expansion history and the structure growth rate .",

    "hence , the bao observations can determine the combination @xmath6 for different redshifts . according to the recent paper @xcite , on the one hand",
    ", the resulting determination of @xmath6 is independent of the assumed cosmological scenario , since both packaging accumulated data in terms of just one redshift for each sample and determining the position of the peak by comparing the matter correlation functions with simulations have a small and negligible dependence on the fiducial cosmological scenario .",

    "for the case of constant redshift function , we analyze the traversabilities of the corresponding wormhole spacetime configuration , and find that the traverse time for a traverser depends entirely on the wormhole spacetime geometry and cosmological background effects , i.e. , the throat radius of the wormhole @xmath86 , the earth gravitational field @xmath90 and the average dark energy equation of state @xmath0 . for the second case ,",
    "we use the viq method to work out the amounts of the exotic matter threading the wormhole and find that one can construct theoretically a traversable wormhole with infinitesimal amounts of anec violating phantom fluid in the present scenario . at",
    "last , as a concrete performance , we exhibit the stability analysis for the first case in the absence of the thin shell , and find that the stable equilibrium configurations may increase for increasing values of the throat radius of the wormhole in the cases of a positive and a negative surface energy density . furthermore , we also find that in the case of @xmath168 , for decreasing values of the throat radius of the wormhole , regardless of the increasing range @xmath183 , the values of the parameter @xmath184 are further restricted .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath169 , the values of the parameter @xmath184 are less restricted for decreasing values of the throat radius of the wormhole .",
    "it is worth noting that the square root of the parameter @xmath153 is usually interpreted as the speed of sound , in order that one could expect @xmath200 which corresponds to the requirement that the speed of sound should not exceed the speed of light .",
    "nonetheless , in the presence of the exotic matter , this requirement can be relaxed since we still have little knowledge about the nature of the dark energy .",
    "note that the obtained wormhole solutions are static and spherically symmetrical metric and we assume @xmath0 to be a constant between different redshifts when placing constraints , therefore , these wormhole solutions can be interpreted as stable and static phantom wormholes configurations at some certain redshift which lies in the range [ 0.32 , 2.34 ] . furthermore , these wormhole solutions are model - independent .",
    "this means that one can directly extract useful astrophysical information from observational data , or conversely , one can effectively probe the cosmological background evolution by astrophysical scale observations .    in the future ,",
    "we expect and believe that more and more highly accurate observations can bring us evolutionary cognition about various celestial bodies , for instance , black holes , wormholes , white dwarfs , pulsars , quasars , etc .",
    "we warmly thank professors bharat ratra and sergei .",
