    "with technological advances in the 20th century , such as miniaturisation of micro electrical and bio - medical devices  @xcite , vacuum technology  @xcite , space exploration  @xcite and production techniques requiring low pressure environments  @xcite , flow systems have become of interest in which the mean free path @xmath0 of individual fluid particles is not negligible in comparison to the geometry length - scale @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , hydrodynamic models assuming a fluid continuum lose validity as non - equilibrium , kinetic effects gain importance .",
    "this transition is commonly quantified by the knudsen number @xmath2 . in this publication , results of the development of a model for two phase flow systems with large concentration imbalances in complex geometries at low pressures are reported .",
    "these types of system are of importance e.g. for reduction of disturbances and quality improvement in the operation of advanced optical systems used in microchip production  @xcite and chemical vapour deposition applications  @xcite .",
    "while numerous numerical approaches capable of simulating flows at finite knudsen number , including molecular dynamics  @xcite , direct numerical simulation including slip corrections up to second order  @xcite , discrete velocity methods  @xcite , lattice - boltzmann methods  @xcite and direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc )  @xcite exist , the latter is by far the most common and has been largely used to benchmark other approaches . despite its success in modelling aerodynamics problems in the upper atmosphere",
    "it has however become evident that for the case of flows in the lower transient and slip regime the dsmc approach still requires a very large number of particles to properly resolve a given flow problem  @xcite .",
    "being based on directly solving the boltzmann formalism as well , lattice - boltzmann methods ( lbm ) too are in principle capable to describe gas flows in arbitrary flow regimes  @xcite .",
    "the commonly used d3q19 single relaxation time lattice - boltzmann or lattice bgk model dealing with a linear approach to a discretised maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium distribution is however originally set up to recover the navier - stokes equations  @xcite . to extend its applicability to the simulation of low pressure gas flows in the slip flow regime of small non - negligible knudsen numbers ,",
    "boundary conditions can be extended to include slip at solid walls  @xcite . for simulating flows up to moderate knudsen numbers , phenomenological higher order lattice - boltzmann models introducing wall function formalisms",
    "are used  @xcite . due to the existing high density gradients and dominating thermal velocity effects",
    "however , the lbm alone is not suited for the simulation of diffusive spreading of low concentrated components in rarefied gases . on the other hand",
    "the assumed low concentration of the second phase allows for a greatly simplified simulation approach , fully resolving particles where necessary , while maintaining computational efficiency  ( detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : method : sub : algorithm ] ) .    in order to increase the numerical efficiency of simulations at low mach numbers / in the slip flow and transition regime , several approaches involving the extension of existing models and (",
    "spatial ) hybrid methods have been published .",
    "fan et al . developed a modified dsmc method , called information preservation technique to reduce statistical fluctuations associated with dsmc at low mach numbers  @xcite .",
    "chun and koch reduced these fluctuations by solving the linearized boltzmann equation together with a correction of the particle velocities after the collision step  @xcite .",
    "hybrid approaches combining classical navier - stokes solvers and dsmc are developed to reduce numerical costs  @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "the computational domain is divided with respect to the local flow regimes and the dsmc method is only used in regions where non - equilibrium effects are dominant . since the coupling between the grid - based navier - stokes solver and the particle based dsmc method is problematic , burt et al .",
    "replaced the grid - based method with a simplified dsmc approach in the continuum region  @xcite . besides these hybrid approaches with increase in efficiency in mind other hybrid models have been developed to achieve a higher precision in approximations to solutions of the boltzmann equation , such as e.g. md - dsmc hybrid methods  @xcite .    to extend the applicability of the hybrid approach to length and timescales immediately relevant to enginieering problems regarding low pressure flows used to reduce contaminant concentrations , in the following a new hybrid approach integrating lbm and dsmc simulation elements in a shared simulation domain is detailed",
    "here , the lattice - boltzmann method as implemented in the application lb3d serves as an efficient ( slip boundary augmented ) navier - stokes solver for flows in complex geometries whereas a monte carlo particle model is used to study diffusion of the dilute contaminants throughout the system .",
    "the focus on contaminant transport in a low pressure environment allows to simplify the model significantly as here the global flow field can be considered without perturbation by the contaminants .",
    "thereby the computational cost as compared to the hybrid models given above is further reduced- the contaminant molecules are assumed to behave at equilibrium with the background - gas where the explicit simulation of particle representatives adds a thermodynamically consistent diffusion model to the athermal lb flow solver .",
    "after further elaborating on aspects of this newly developed approach , contaminant transport aspects in terms of thermal velocity , diffusivity and advection diffusion problems are evaluated .",
    "results of simulations performed in a model of an experimental setup are reported before we close with concluding remarks .",
    "the model aims to simulate dilute contaminants in a homogeneous atmosphere .",
    "this situation arises when low pressurised gas flows are employed to flush systems containing certain contaminants .",
    "the dilution is very important for the simplification of the model to hold . in particular for such cases it is possible to neglect the action of the contaminant on the atmospheric gas .",
    "the lbm with intermediate knudsen regime boundary corrections is employed to simulate the background gas .",
    "single local contaminants are simulated as particles , where the collision processes with the background gas are solved implicitly by performing a monte carlo algorithm where the equilibrium velocity is galileian shifted to account for advection .    in effect , the simulation of the contaminant component is independent of the background gas model as long as the latter provides a ( quasi-)static velocity field and thermodynamic state as input . in the remainder",
    "we briefly revisit the modifications made to the lbm and give an overview of the monte carlo algorithm .",
    "finally , the parameterisation is discussed in the context of an example thermodynamic configuration .",
    "the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) approach is based on the boltzmann kinetic equation @xmath3 f({\\bf r , u},t)={\\bf \\omega},\\ ] ] which describes the evolution of the single particle probability density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the position , @xmath6 the velocity , and @xmath7 the time . the derivatives on the left hand side represent propagation of particles in phase space whereas the collision operator @xmath8 takes into account molecular collisions .    in the lb method",
    "the time @xmath7 , the position @xmath5 , and the velocity @xmath6 are discretised . in units of the lattice constant @xmath9 and the time step @xmath10",
    "this leads to a discrete version of eq .",

    "@xmath13 it can be shown that the flow behaviour follows the navier - stokes equation  @xcite .",
    "we choose the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) form  @xcite @xmath14 which assumes a relaxation on a linear time - scale towards a discretised local maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the mean collision time that determines the kinematic viscosity @xmath17 of the fluid .",

    "the particle velocity distribution @xmath23 can be related to physical properties via its moments .",
    "here follows e.g. the macroscopic velocity vector @xmath24 from the first order moment by    @xmath25    normalised by the local density    @xmath26    the zeroth order moment .",
    "as detailed in the introduction , for flows in systems either at very low pressure or of geometry on the nanometer scale the characteristic dimensionless number , the knudsen number @xmath27 becomes none negligible .",
    "the mean free path for gases under ambient pressure @xmath28 is in the order of a few tens of nm , for classical technical flow problems in geometries much larger than this effects associated with higher knudsen numbers can therefore be neglected .    for @xmath29",
    "rarefication effects gain noticeable influence on the flow characteristics and slip at the walls has to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "this becomes relevant for macroscopically sized geometries in the regime of pressures of only a few pascal considered here .",
    "thus , to correct the lattice bgk ( lbgk ) navier - stokes solver for the discontinuous velocity field in the knudsen layer , a slip boundary condition as proposed by zhang _",

    "@xcite has been implemented .",

    "@xcite , ansumali and karlin  @xcite and an extension of existing boundary conditions by toschi and succi introducing updated collision statistics by so - called virtual wall collisions  @xcite .    in the remainder of this work , a two - step extension of the boundary condition by a diffusive reflection regime as well as a wall function modifying the effective",
    "mean free path is used as proposed by zhang _",
    "et al._. following their formulation , the knudsen number in a lbgk model is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the number of lattice sites used to resolve the characteristic length . from this",
    "it is immediately clear that the mean free path in this model is depending on the relaxation time @xmath32 only .",
    "it is thereby linked to the fluid viscosity .",
    "a first employed boundary condition allows to control the reflective behaviour and thereby implicitly the slip by an accommodation parameter @xmath33 defined between @xmath34 relating to no - slip or _ bounce - back _ and @xmath35 implementing full - slip or _",
    "specular reflection_. in the simulations described in the scope of this work , an accommodation parameter of @xmath36 is chosen .",
    "this corresponds to diffuse deflection at a rough wall  @xcite .",
    "as with higher @xmath27 and/or increase in resolution the knudsen layer occupies a range of several lattice sites depth , simple slip boundary conditions overestimate the velocity at the boundary .",
    "the reason for this is a significant reduction in the mean free path of particles in the vicinity of a surface , effectively lowering the local knudsen number .",
    "recently , several methods have been introduced to reflect this by the introduction of an effective mean free path @xmath37 .",
    "integrations with the lattice - boltzmann method have been introduced by tao _",

    "dsmc algorithms solve the boltzmann equation in terms of free movement and collisions of particles representative of a thermodynamical state .",
    "free movement is calculated straightforward at a given ( thermal ) velocity assigned to the particles .",
    "the distinction of the method lies in its approach to model particle collisions . after free flight for the duration of a given collision interval particles are binned and randomised collision partners in a bin volume are drawn .",
    "each of these pairs is subsequently calculated to perform a momentum conserving collision assigning a new particle velocity .",
    "this coarse grained collision model increases simulation efficiency dramatically as integration of the particle movement to predict explicit collisions is not necessary . at the same time",
    "the method has been shown to produce thermodynamically accurate results , especially in the context of dilute systems with finite knudsen numbers .",
    "in the approach presented here , the observation of collision time intervals is replaced by collision time calculation from the mean free path travelled in the system .",
    "taking into account only atmosphere - contaminant interactions , atmospheric collision partners are not drawn from representative particles in a volume but rather created as pseudo - particles parameterised by properties of the lb field in the vicinity of a contaminant particle .",
    "an event driven algorithm focusing on collision events is implemented .",
    "assuming local equilibrium , according to the mass @xmath41 of contaminant species @xmath42 and temperature @xmath43 the individual particle velocity is drawn from a maxwell distribution . from the mean particle velocity @xmath44 , the time span @xmath45 to the next collision event",
    "is calculated as @xmath46 , implicitly assuring the mean free path to be @xmath47 in this derivation , properties of atmospheric species @xmath48 were used . the particle density per unit volume @xmath49",
    "is calculated for an ideal gas .",
    "the symbols @xmath50 designate the reduced mass and @xmath51 the effective collision radius , calculated as the arithmetic average of atomic radii approximated by lennard - jones potential parameters given by karniadakis _",
    "_  @xcite .    at collision time",
    "the lbm lattice is used as binning grid .",
    "all contaminant particles present at a given lattice site undergo a collision with an ad hoc created _ pseudo particle _ , generated as a representative of the local atmospheric gas flow . in particular , the atmosphere gas particles are assigned a velocity @xmath52 according to a maxwell distribution whose mean value @xmath53 is shifted to reflect the velocity @xmath54 of the lattice - boltzmann field .",
    "per direction @xmath55 this reads @xmath56 subsequent binary collisions between hard spheres are implemented classically , assuming conserved velocity of the centre of mass and thus global momentum conservation , while updating the relative velocity of the collision partners  @xcite .",
    "the centre of mass velocity @xmath57 and the relative velocity @xmath58 of a contaminant particle @xmath42 and a pseudo particle @xmath48 are given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively . with @xmath61 and @xmath62 denoting the post collision centre of mass and relative velocity respectively , kinetic energy and momentum is conserved in the collision by imposing @xmath63 and @xmath64 . since particles are assumed to be hard spheres all directions for @xmath62 are equally likely as scattering of hard spheres is isotropic .",
    "the post collision velocities of the particles can then be determined using a randomly chosen direction for the relative velocity considering @xmath64 and the post collision equivalents of eq .",
    "( [ eq : center_of_mass_vel ] ) and ( [ eq : relative_vel ] ) .",
    "the updated contaminant velocity is employed for the calculation of the time interval @xmath45 elapsed until the next collision event .",
    "the information of the pseudo particle is discarded .",
    "this collision process serves both to couple the contaminant particles to the atmospheric flow and as a thermostat ( see section [ sec : valmaxwell ] ) .    in the scope of this work the respective lattice - boltzmann velocity field is pre - simulated until an equilibrium state is reached .",
    "there exists however no principle limitation on the synchronisation of the relaxation processes .",
    "rather the quality of the modelling of dynamics in the style of dsmc is improved by taking into account the local time - dependent equilibrium determined by the lbgk algorithm .",
    "analytical approximations of transport coefficients in this regime suggest e.g. that the mutual diffusivity can under these assumptions be expressed as a lorentz - approximation ( mass - ratio ) corrected self - diffusivity coefficient of the atmosphere gas ( see section [ sec : valfick ] ) .",
    "rarefication effects are prominent in the knudsen layer only .",
    "thus special attention has to be paid to the boundary condition in the particle perspective as well .",
    "since the main focus of the algorithm lies on true reproduction of the subscribed mean free path by timing collision events , the implementation of an accurate boundary condition is however straightforward .",
    "for the sake of simplicity again the lattice - boltzmann site decomposition is used to define the boundary geometry , introducing discretisation errors in systems with curved boundaries . for these cases",
    "the method may be improved by another choice of surface definition , e.g. using interpolation techniques  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that by resolving the knudsen layer by as little as four lattice sites the error observed in the flow field can be limited to the order of 5 percent . for a resolution of 8 lattice sites the deviation reduces to some per cent .",
    "as discussed above for a working model of flow in the intermediate kn regime surface slip has to be taken into account as well as the reduction in phase space volume in the vicinity of a boundary .",
    "both requirements are met by a boundary condition reducing a particle s travelled distance if encountering a wall .",
    "the algorithm evaluates , whether during free movement a particle is travelling into a different lb node and subsequently whether it is a boundary node .",
    "if the particle would enter a boundary node , its position is reset to the point of contact , effectively reducing its travelled path .",
    "the subsequent collision event is modelled as diffusive reflection inverting the velocity component normal to the boundary surface .",
    "the thermal velocity is drawn from the half set with an inverted velocity component normal to the wall .",
    "this treatment is implicitly reducing the mean free path proportional to the surface to volume ratio in the system as well as reducing the phase space volume .",
    "the boundary condition is evaluated for a simple advection diffusion problem for which an analytical solution is available ( see section [ sec : valtransport ] ) .",
    "the validity of the lbm is chiefly limited by the underlying ( thermo- ) statistical principles and approximations in expansions .",
    "it is possible to define a lb specific knudsen limit based on the idea that the local equilibrium approximation on a lattice site does not hold anymore .",
    "another way of putting this is given with the low mach number limit which requires the _ transported _ momentum density on the lattice to be low .",
    "this clarifies that all modifications made to capture the intermediate knudsen regime can only be phenomenological .",
    "as the evaluation of channel flow in the low knudsen regime illustrates , modified continuum models can be suited to simulate flows in this regime .",
    "nonetheless , when working with the modification of choice , leaving the core algorithm unmodified , the original restrictions have of course still to be observed .    in order to be able to understand the units captured by the model",
    ", a conversion of the core units is instructive .",
    "the scaling units of length @xmath9 , time @xmath10 and mass @xmath65 are typically calculated by use of the constant speed of sound on the lattice as well as the kinematic shear viscosity imposed by the collision scheme . when aiming to model real systems , the usual choice of unit mass might be dismissed to calibrate the system in order to preserve numerical stability in cases were",
    "realistic pressures otherwise lead to very high densities or in cases where the relaxation rates are getting very low .",
    "in the cases employed here , starting out from length - scaling the lattice to match a physical system , length and time scales are fixed by comparing the speed of sound in the desired physical system with the one on the lattice .",
    "keeping the lattice mass at unity , the overall mass scaling is then determined by comparison of the resulting dynamic shear viscosity with the one of the desired physical system .",
    "a typical approach to the parameterisation of a simulation system is made by deciding on the spatial resolution of a system , determining the lattice spacing @xmath66 .",
    "together with the lattice discretisation and the thereby determined speed of sound @xmath22 this immediately fixes the time step @xmath67 = @xmath68 and the conversion units for the kinematic viscosity @xmath69 .",
    "for the case of a single fluid adhering to the ideal gas law @xmath70 for the relation of pressure and fluid density , the consideration of the thermodynamic state and modelled substance , i.e. temperature , mass and pressure fixes a mass scale @xmath65 .",
    "conversion of the dynamic viscosity @xmath71 then allows to determine the relaxation time or shear viscosity relaxation parameter @xmath32 or @xmath72 via @xmath73 . here",
    ", some tuning flexibility is given by the mass scaling , allowing to adjust the simulated mean fluid density against the relaxation time parameter .",

    "motivated by industrial applications requiring contaminant suppression in low vacuum environments , a hybrid simulation model has been refined and validated . a monte carlo algorithm to introduce a diffusivity model to a lbm setup has been developed and improved in thermostatistic context .",
    "the problem considered comprises an ideal gas which is flushing a system pressurised in the single digit pascal range , where medium sized organic contaminants are present in the system .",
    "the sparsity of the contaminant molecules allows complete neglect of their impact on the gas flow . as a result",
    "it is necessary to couple the solution of the gas flow into the simulation of the contaminants only .",
    "this important simplification allows efficient calculation of the diffusive transport ( the contaminant simulations are executed as a single process and finish in a matter of hours ) . by only requiring a quasi static solution to the flow field ,",
    "the monte carlo portion of the model is furthermore independent of the choice of flow solver used to obtain said solutions .    with the intermediate goal of simulating and predicting flow on scales relevant to engineering , the lbm has been selected due to its adaptability to complex geometries . while the method is not readily applicable to intermediate knudsen flow regimes , phenomenological corrections can be introduced to recover the flow behaviour observed in rarefied systems with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the monte carlo model is distinguished by combination of two central ideas .",
    "first , the coupling of a local advective velocity by shift of the expectation values of the gaussian thermal velocity distributions constituting the local maxwellian .",
    "second , the parameterisation of a collision event - driven algorithm determining time scales by the mean free path and equilibrium velocities .",
    "the resulting algorithm has been validated to recover correct thermal velocity distributions as well as superposed advective velocities .",
    "since the coupling algorithm implicitly acts as a thermostat , the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of particle velocities is assured at all times .",
    "using collision properties of hard spheres with an additional mass contrast correction , quantitative prediction of the diffusivity of the contaminants for a given thermodynamical state and particle mass has been successful .",
    "the mass correction term found here may be of practical relevance to more than this application as it illustrates and quantifies the relevance of mass contrasts in momentum transfer and resulting diffusivity .",
    "a more complex test case combines an effective advection - diffusion , or transport model with a test of the boundary conditions .",
    "it has to be refrained from developing a quantitative solution to the particle distribution in the boundary layer .",
    "quantitative agreement with the approximation of an infinite fixed concentration source could however be obtained when a density integrated over the boundary layer was used .    in a final step",
    "the developed combined method has been applied to suppression of contaminant diffusive transport by gas flows through an opening in the low intermediate knudsen regime .",
    "qualitative evaluation of gas flow rate and resulting suppression has yielded promising results .",
    "as expected there exists a well defined linear dependence of the flow rate on the applied pressure gradient .",
    "furthermore the resulting suppression is an exponential function of the flow rate .",
    "further development and application of the model can be envisioned in both experimental as well as theoretical context .",
    "true to the original motivation of the work a natural next step is the comparison with experimental results . to this end",
    ", this work provides a parameterisation framework both of the lbm and the monte carlo algorithm where input can be provided in si units . while some limitations such as the low mach number limit and the principal continuity assumption apply , the method is able to cover a wide range of technically relevant scales .",
    "theoretical extensions of the model can be made by means of refining the algorithm to increase its overall accuracy .",
    "a very obvious flaw of the current model living on the lbm lattice is the very limited resolution of boundary shapes .",
    "also the coupling to models capable of providing exact solutions to the knudsen layer flow to some problems could be very interesting .",
    "also extension of the collision model to include soft potentials , etc .",
