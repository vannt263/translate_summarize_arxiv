    "bell inequalities that correlation functions satisfying local realistic theories must obey can be violated by certain quantum predictions , as bell reported in 1964  @xcite .",
    "bell used the singlet state , or epr pairs  @xcite , to show that the correlation functions measured in such singlet states can not be modeled by local realistic models .",
    "likewise , a certain set of correlation functions produced by quantum measurements of a quantum state contradicts certain predictions of local realistic theories .",
    "those states also can not be modeled by local realistic models . up to now",
    ", local realistic theories have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "many experiments have shown that bell inequalities and local realistic theories are violated  @xcite .",
    "later , in a work by fine  @xcite , a set of correlation functions can be described with the property that they are reproducible by local realistic theories for a system in two - partite states if and only if the set of correlation functions satisfies the complete set of ( two - setting ) bell inequalities .",
    "this result is generalized  @xcite to a system described by multipartite states in the case where two dichotomic observables are measured per site .    in this paper , we present a method using two bell operators  @xcite to refute local realistic models of a quantum state . in order to do so ,",
    "we need only a two - setting and two - particle bell experiment reproducible by local realistic theories .",
    "such a bell experiment also reveals the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics in the sense that the bell - ukowski inequality @xcite is violated .",
    "let us consider two - qubit states that , under specific settings , give correlation functions reproducible by local realistic theories .",
    "imagine that @xmath0 copies of the states can be distributed among @xmath1 parties in such a way that each pair of parties shares one copy of the state .",
    "the parties perform a bell - greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) @xmath1-particle experiment  @xcite on their qubits .",
    "each of the pairs of parties uses the measurement settings noted above .",
    "the bell - mermin operator  @xcite , @xmath2 , for their experiment does not show any violation of local realism .",
    "nevertheless , one can find another bell operator , which differs from @xmath2 by a numerical factor , that does show such a violation .",
    "that is , the original two - qubit states can not be modeled by local realistic models .",
    "more specifically , the situation is as follows : a given two - setting and two - particle bell experiment is reproducible by local realistic theories .",
    "however , the experimental correlation functions can compute a violation of the bell - ukowski inequality .",
    "therefore , actually measured data reveal that the measured state can not be modeled by local realistic models .",
    "thus , a conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics is revealed .",
    "we can see this phenomenon by the simple algebra presented below .",
    "this phenomenon can occur when the system is in a mixed two - qubit state .",
    "we analyze the threshold visibility for two - particle interference to reveal the conflict mentioned above .",
    "it is found that the threshold visibility agrees with the value to obtain a violation of the bell - ukowski inequality .",
    "let @xmath3 be @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the following specific bell - mermin operator ( see eq .",
    "( [ mermin operator ] ) ) : @xmath5 are ghz states @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 an average of the bell - mermin operator is evaluated by using a standard two - setting bell experiment . see fig .  [ standard ] .",
    "one can introduce a @xmath1-partite bell operator , which one may call the bell - ukowski operator @xmath7 , which differs from @xmath8 only by a numerical factor .",
    "the bell - ukowski operator @xmath9 @xcite is @xmath10 .",
    "clearly , we see that the bell - mermin operator given in eq .",
    "( [ bmineq ] ) is connected to the bell - ukowski operator @xmath9 in the following relation : @xmath11one can see that the specific two - setting bell @xmath1-particle experiment in question computes an average value of the bell - ukowski operator @xmath12 when an average value of @xmath13 is evaluated . of course , this argument is due to the validity of quantum mechanics .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ equal ] .    from the bell - ukowski inequality latexmath:[\\ ] ]    in the following section , we will use this kind of experimental situation .",
    "those experimental correlation functions can compute a violation of the bell - ukowski inequality . in order to do so",
    ", we shall compute an expectation value of the bell - mermin operator in the next section .",
    "imagine that @xmath0 copies of the states introduced in the preceding section can be distributed among @xmath1 parties in such a way that each pair of parties shares one copy of the state @xmath34 suppose that spatially separated @xmath1 observers perform measurements on each of @xmath1 particles .",
    "the decision processes for choosing measurement observables are space - like separated .",
    "it can be regarded as a standard two - setting bell experiment in an entangled state in @xmath1 particles .",
    "see fig .  [",
    "experiment ] .",
    "we assume that a two - orthogonal - setting bell - ghz @xmath1-particle correlation experiment is performed .",
    "we choose measurement observables such that @xmath35 namely , each of the pairs of parties uses measurement settings such that they can check the condition in eq .",
    "( [ lhv ] ) .",
    "therefore , it should be that given @xmath36 correlation functions are described with the property that they are reproducible by local realistic theories .",
    "the bell - mermin operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not show any violation of local realism as shown below .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the function @xmath40@xmath39 is invertible as @xmath41the bell - mermin operators @xmath37 and @xmath42 are defined by @xcite @xmath43the bell - mermin inequality can be expressed as @xcite @xmath44we also define @xmath45 for any subset @xmath46 by @xmath47it is easy to see that , when @xmath48 are disjoint , @xmath49 which leads to following equations : @xmath50 in specific operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 given in eq .",

    "thus , they get an average value of the specific bell - mermin operator given in eq .",
    "( [ bmineq ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ gb ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 clearly , the bell - mermin operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 for their experiment do not show any violation of local realism as we have mentioned above .",
    "nevertheless , when @xmath17 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 we have a violation of the condition in eq .",
    "( [ newbell ] ) , i.e. , one can compute a violation of the bell - ukowski inequality @xmath61 that is , the measured two - qubit state can not be modeled by local realistic models . the condition in eq .",
    "( [ mainresult ] ) says that the threshold visibility decreases when the number of copies , @xmath0 , increases . in an extreme situation ,",
    "when @xmath62 , we have the desired condition @xmath63to show the conflict in question .",
    "this agrees with the value to get a violation of the bell - ukowski inequality .",
    "it is worth noting that the condition in eq .",

    "( [ mainresult ] ) .",
    "the given example using two - qubit states reveals the violation of the bell - ukowski inequality .",
    "the interesting point is that all the information to get the violation of the bell - ukowski inequality can be obtained only by a two - setting and two - particle bell experiment reproducible by local realistic theories .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the bell - ukowski operator can be represented by the bell - mermin operator .",
    "this fact provides a means to check whether a quantum state can be modeled by local realistic models , i.e. , if the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics occurs .",
    "our argument relies only on a two - setting and two - particle bell experiment reproducible by local realistic theories .",

    "this phenomenon can occur when the system is in a mixed state .",
