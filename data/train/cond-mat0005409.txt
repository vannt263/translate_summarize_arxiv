    "the nature of the normal state of high - t@xmath0 superconductors is still an open question . within arpes ,",
    "the discussion has initially centered on line shapes  @xcite , but with improved resolution and material preparation , has moved to pseudogap behavior  @xcite and fermi surface evolution  @xcite .",
    "the present work investigates , does the recently observed  @xcite change of shape of the fermi surface in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 with doping by itself require invoking correlations .",
    "in particular : is there a sign that the local electronic environment is different than the ` effective ' one - particle picture which can reproduce these shapes .",
    "we start from a metallic state and three bands , and assume that the principal effect of the infinite on - site repulsion is in charge correlations .",
    "this regime was first described by the sb model at the saddle - point  @xcite , by renormalizing @xmath4 .",
    "physically , the local overlap is not always renormalized , because when an electron of one spin is on a site , the other is may not be near .",
    "this distinction between local and long - range behavior is lost at the saddle - point .",
    "the rt model  @xcite keeps the distinction , by first hybridizing the electron within a single cuo@xmath3 ` molecule ' through the bare overlap , and then producing an effective band by randomly tiling these molecules in the plane .",
    "it satisfies the pauli principle for the original electrons exactly .",
    "the price paid is that the one - particle formulation is achieved by assuming that the down - spins do not hop at all .",
    "the fact that they do is simulated by annealment .",
    "we can not justify this microscopically ; however , the assumption , that the two spins see each other as static  @xcite , is implicit at the sb saddle - point as well  @xcite .",
    "to face measurements , we include the oxygen - oxygen overlap @xmath5 in the rt model in the simplest local approximation , just adding the @xmath5 terms to a cuo@xmath3 ` tile ' .",
    "this underestimates the tendency of @xmath5 to rotate the fermi surface , strenghtening our conclusion .",
    "the implementation of the slave - boson model with @xmath5  @xcite follows the literature .",
    "( 6.9,5.75 ) ( 0,-1 )    in fig .  1",
    ", we compare the rt and sb input parameters needed to fit observed fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "both models can fit all the data equally well at all dopings .",
    "the fit was sensitive to @xmath5 , while less was gained by varying @xmath4 and the bare copper - oxygen splitting @xmath6 , so they were kept fixed .",
    "overdoped samples ( @xmath7 ) require a rather small value of @xmath8  ev , and the two models nearly agree .",
    "for the underdoped ( @xmath9 ) sample , the discrepancy is a factor of two ( 0.6  ev for sb , 0.3  ev for rt ) .",
    "it is known  @xcite that such , fairly large , values of @xmath5 are required to rotate the fermi surface in the sb model .    at @xmath10 ,",
    "the fits are ` too good ' , passing near data points , not merely within error bars . however , if the same ` perfect ' fits are required at @xmath9 , @xmath5 needs to be much larger , increasing the discrepancy factor to three .",
    "fourier series being efficient in fitting smooth curves , the mere fact that a dispersion with more than nearest neighbors fits a 2d fermi surface is hardly significant .",
    "a credible phenomenology needs to be both sensibly constrained , and require little variation in the input parameters .",
    "cases where it breaks down should also be understood .",
    "the fits in this work were constrained by modelling , with only the bare parameters put in .",
    "also , only @xmath5 varied with the data , which amounts to ` freezing ' the lattice .",
    "although technically no more than fits within error bars are required , it is significant that the data overtax both models at underdoping , as evident by drastically increased @xmath5 when pushed to overfit .",
    "the rt model treats the data more sparsely , with a range in @xmath5 ( full lines ) of 0.2  ev , _ vs. _  0.55  ev for the sb model .",
    "this , and the quantitatively different tendency to breakdown at @xmath9 , leads us to conclude that the distinction between local and effective overlap is physically relevant for the underdoped and , probably , optimally doped samples , but not for @xmath7 .",
    "we find open fermi surfaces at @xmath9 and @xmath11 as the result of correlations , at a reasonably low bare @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to one of the regimes where an extended vh singularity can be obtained in the copper bonding band  @xcite .",
    "the 0.2  ev variation of @xmath5 , still remaining in the rt model , could be due to our ` local ' approximation in including it , lattice evolution , and spin correlations  @xcite",
