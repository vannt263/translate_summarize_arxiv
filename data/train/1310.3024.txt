    "the drgt gravity  @xcite is considered as a promising massive gravity model which yields einstein gravity in the massless limit .",
    "recently , it was shown that the stability of the schwarzschild black hole in the four dimensional drgt gravity could be determined by the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability @xcite of a five - dimensional black string . the small schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath1 in the drgt gravity and its bi - gravity extension  @xcite , and fourth - order gravity  @xcite is unstable against metric and ricci tensor perturbations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these results may indicate that static black holes in massive gravity do not exist .",
    "interestingly , it turned out that in a massive theory of the einstein - weyl gravity , the linearized einstein tensor perturbations exhibit unstable modes of the schwarzschild - ads black hole featuring the gl instability of five - dimensional ads black string , in contrast to the stable schwarzschild - ads black hole in the einstein gravity  @xcite",
    ". the linearized ricci tensor perturbations were employed to exhibit unstable modes of the schwarzschild - tangherlini ( higher dimensional schwarzschild ) black hole in higher - dimensional fourth order gravity which features the gl instability of higher dimensional black strings  @xcite , in comparison with the stable schwarzschild - tangherlini black holes in higher - dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "these imply that the gl instability of the black holes in the massive gravity originates from the massiveness , but not a nature of the fourth - order gravity giving ghost states .",
    "also , one could avoid the ghost problem arising from the metric perturbations in the fourth - order gravity when using the linearized einstein and ricci tensors because their linearized equations become the second - order tensor equations .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown that the four - dimensional btz black string in einstein gravity is stable against metric perturbations regardless of the horizon size , which is also supported by a thermodynamic argument of gubser - mitra conjecture  @xcite .",
    "later on , however , it was argued that the btz black string is not always stable against metric perturbations  @xcite . in the literatures",
    "@xcite , there exists a threshold value for @xmath4 ( we use a different notation @xmath5 to avoid a confusion @xmath6 here ) which is related to the compactification of the extra dimension of the tensor perturbation .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that for @xmath7 with @xmath8 ads@xmath9 curvature radius , the btz black string is stable against @xmath0-mode metric perturbation , while for @xmath10 it is unstable .",
    "therefore , it seems to be necessary to point out which one is correct .",
    "the new massive gravity has been introduced as a fourth - order gravity with a healthy massive spin-2 mode and a massless spin-2 ghost mode , which is pure gauge only in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this parity - even gravity describes two modes of helicity @xmath11 and @xmath12 [ 2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ] of a massive graviton , but it has a drawback of serving as a unitary model of massive gravity only in three dimensions  @xcite . for @xmath13 with @xmath6 the mass of graviton , the three - dimensional btz black hole in the new massive gravity is shown to be stable against @xmath0-mode metric perturbation  @xcite when using the positivity of the potential outside the horizon . to this direction",
    ", it was recently reported that the stability of the btz black hole was mainly determined by the asymptotes of black hole spacetime : the condition of the @xmath0-mode stability is consistent with the generalized breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound ( @xmath14 ) for metric perturbations on asymptotically ads@xmath9 spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this result may imply that the stability condition is extended simply from @xmath13 to @xmath14 if @xmath6 is allowed to be a negative quantity .",
    "however , one expects that two different type of instabilities appears for the btz black hole in new massive gravity : one is from the bf bound based on the tensor propagation on asymptotically ads@xmath9 spacetime , while the other is the gl instability of a massive graviton propagating on the btz black hole spacetime .",
    "this is similar to two instabilities of ads black holes to trigger a holographic superconductor phase within the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the ads@xmath15 black hole becomes unstable to form non - trivial fields outside its horizon when being close to extremality whose near - horizon geometry is ads@xmath16 . for a massive scalar with mass @xmath6 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , two ads spacetimes are unstable  @xcite .",
    "hence , it suggests strongly that the stability of btz black hole should be revisited in new massive gravity by observing the gl instability of four - dimensional black string .",
    "we will show that the instability of a massive graviton persists even in three - dimensional btz black hole .",
    "this establishes that the instability of the black holes in the @xmath19-dimensional massive gravity originates from the massiveness , but not a nature of the fourth - order gravity giving ghost states . as a byproduct",
    ", we will show that the four - dimensional btz black string is stable against the @xmath0-mode metric perturbation because its mass squared is positive ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we start with the three - dimensional fourth order gravity defined as @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 the three - dimensional gravitational coupling constant . from the action ( [ 3dfog ] )",
    ", the einstein equation is derived to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 takes the form @xmath24    for @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the non - rotating btz black hole solution is given by @xmath27 where the metric function takes the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the adm mass . from the condition of @xmath31 , the horizon",
    "is located at @xmath32 .    for a perturbation around the btz black hole @xmath33 the linearized einstein tensor , ricci tensor , and ricci scalar",
    "are given by @xmath34 where the einstein tensor @xmath35 .",
    "with the help of the above quantities , the linearized einstein equation can be written as @xmath36\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( 2\\alpha+\\beta)\\big[\\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu}\\bar{\\nabla}^2-\\bar{\\nabla}_{\\mu } \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\nu}+2\\lambda \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu } \\big ] \\delta r + \\beta\\big(\\bar{\\nabla}^2\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}-\\lambda \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu } \\delta r\\big)=0 .",

    "this explains why we choose the new massive gravity . plugging @xmath43 and @xmath44 into ( [ lineq ] )",
    "leads to the linearized einstein tensor equation @xmath45 where the mass squared is given by @xmath46 choosing the transverse - traceless gauge @xmath47 eq .",
    "( [ linein ] ) leads to the fourth - order equation for the metric perturbation @xmath48 @xmath49 which might imply the two second - order linearized equations @xmath50h_{\\mu\\nu}=0 , \\\\ \\label{nmgmeq2 } & & \\big[\\bar{\\nabla}^2 - 2\\lambda -m^2\\big]h_{\\mu\\nu}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] off critical point ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) may describe 2 dof for a massive graviton in three dimensions , it might not be a correct equation because the ` @xmath52 ' sign disappears when splitting ( [ linh ] ) into ( [ nmgmeq1 ] ) and ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) . in order to see this ghost problem explicitly ,",
    "we consider the three - dimensional flat spacetime . in the case of @xmath53 , the tree - level scattering amplitude @xmath54 between two conserved sources @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "after partial fractions , this leads to @xmath59 in order not to have a tachyon , we have to choose @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "also , we require @xmath62 to have a healthy massive spin-2 without negative norm states ( ghosts ) and a massless spin-2 ghost . this is why one chooses a negative @xmath21 for a positive @xmath63 in 3d flat spacetime .",
    "however , we might miss the ghost problem when splitting ( [ linh ] ) into ( [ nmgmeq1 ] ) and ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) without imposing the sign correction .",
    "hence , it would be better to use the second - order equation ( [ linein ] ) for the linearized einstein tensor if it could describe 2 dof . for this purpose",
    ", we have two constraints @xmath64 where the last one comes from contracting the linearized bianchi identity @xmath65\\rho\\sigma}=0 $ ] with @xmath66 .",
    "then , we have 2 dof because @xmath67 .",
    "hence , we note that eq .",
    "( [ linein ] ) is interpreted as a boosted - up version of eq .",
    "( [ nmgmeq2 ] )  @xcite .    in 3d flat spacetime ,",
    "the mass squared should be positive ( @xmath68 ) because of the non - tachyonic condition but it is allowed to be negative in asymptotically ads@xmath9 spacetime .",
    "accordingly , the bf bound for a tensor field could be read off from eqs .",
    "( [ linein ] ) and ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) as @xmath69 however , in the case of 4d btz black string , one requires @xmath4 because it comes from the compactification of an extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "hence , the bf bound does not require a further condition for the stability of the 4d btz black string .",
    "in order to investigate the gl instability of the massive graviton propagating on the btz black hole spacetime , we first start with ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) for convenience , because ( [ linein ] ) and ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) are the same equation . for @xmath70-mode analysis , a metric perturbation takes the form with four components @xmath71 and @xmath72 as @xmath73 substituting eq.([type2 ] ) into eq.([nmgmeq2 ] ) and after a tedious manipulation , we obtain the second - order equation for a single physical field @xmath74 @xcite as @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0-mode perturbation is described by a single field @xmath77 , even though we were starting with four components and the massive graviton has two dof for @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that the second - order equation ( [ htreq ] ) can be reduced to two first - order equations with a constraint when using the perturbation equation ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) together with the tt gauge condition ( [ tt ] )  @xcite .",
    "the two coupled first - order equations are given by @xmath79h_++ \\big[-\\frac{3}{2r}+\\frac{(2m^2 + 1/\\ell^2)r}{4{\\cal m}}+\\frac{r\\omega^2}{{\\cal m}v}\\big ] h_-.\\label{hmd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a constraint equation can be written as @xmath80h_- -rv(2m^2 + 1/\\ell^2)\\omega h_+{\\nonumber}\\\\ & & \\hspace*{15em}+2v(2m^2{\\cal m}-{\\cal m}/\\ell^2 + 2\\omega^2)h~=~0,\\label{cons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 at infinity of @xmath82 , asymptotic solutions to eqs.([hd ] ) and ( [ hmd ] ) are @xmath83 where @xmath84 are @xmath85 at the horizon of @xmath86 , their solutions are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 take the forms @xmath89 imposing two boundary conditions of the regular solutions at infinity and horizon correspond to choosing @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .    eliminating @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "( [ hd ] ) and ( [ hmd ] ) by using the constraint ( [ cons ] ) leads to the two coupled equations with @xmath93 and @xmath94 only . for fixed @xmath95 and various values of @xmath96 , we solve these equations numerically ) and ( [ hmd ] ) numerically , we begin it by considering asymptotic solutions ( [ ha ] ) and ( [ hma ] ) at the horizon . for given @xmath95 ,",
    "we find the consistent values of @xmath96 to have the asymptotic behavior of @xmath97 . for a complete analysis",
    ", we have already checked the results given in fig.3 of the literature @xcite . ] which yields permitted values of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath6 . as a result , this shows clearly that there exist unstable modes ( see fig.1 ) .        comparing with higher dimensional black strings  @xcite , we would like to mention a couple of key points observed from fig .",
    "firstly we can fix the ads@xmath98 curvature radius ( @xmath99 ) by taking into account the scaling symmetry given in eqs .",
    "( [ hd])-([cons ] ) as @xmath100 with an arbitrary constant @xmath101 .",
    "the second point is that the threshold mass for @xmath102 is given near @xmath103 , which implies that gl instability exists for @xmath104 when recovering the ads@xmath9 curvature radius @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the btz black hole is unstable against the @xmath0-mode metric perturbation regardless of the horizon size . on the other hand ,",
    "the threshold mass of @xmath105 can be read off approximately by taking the limit of @xmath106 in the constraint equation ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "therefore , the stability condition is given by @xmath107 which is exactly the same condition obtained from the positivity of the potential ( @xmath108 )  @xcite .",
    "the potential appears in the schrdinger equation @xmath109\\psi=0,~~\\omega = i\\omega\\ ] ] which was derived from the second - order equation ( [ htreq ] ) by introducing a new field @xmath110 defined by @xmath111 . combining it with",
    "the bf bound ( [ bf - bound ] ) for stability condition of tensor field at asymptotically ads@xmath9 spacetime , we find that the instability of the btz black hole in new massive gravity is extended to @xmath112 up to now , we have made our instability analysis with ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) for the metric tensor . since two equations",
    "( [ linein ] ) and ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) take the same form when replacing @xmath113 by @xmath48 and they describe 2 dof with ( [ tt ] ) and ( [ gtt ] ) , the instability analysis for @xmath114 persists in that of @xmath113 .",
    "one additional advantage when using ( [ linein ] ) is to avoid the ghost problem .",
    "finally , considering @xmath115 ( [ mass - sq ] ) , we rewrite the stability condition ( [ st - con ] ) as @xmath116 which is exactly the same condition for the 4d black string with positive mass squared @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the 4d black string is stable under the @xmath0-mode metric perturbation regardless of the horizon size  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the new massive gravity which is known to be a unitary gravity model in three dimensions , could not accommodate the btz black hole by observing the gl instability for the mass @xmath6 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the gl instability has nothing to do with the ghost issue arising from the fourth - order gravity of the new massive gravity because we have used two second - order equations ( [ nmgmeq2 ] ) and ( [ linein ] ) for @xmath48 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "also , this instability could not be explained in terms of the gubser - mitra conjecture because the heat capacity of the btz black hole is always positive .",
    "this instability arises from the massiveness ( @xmath119 ) of the new massive gravity . in the massless case of @xmath120 ,",
    "one has a massless graviton propagating on the btz black hole spacetime which is gauge artefact in three dimensions . in this case , the stability issue of the btz black hole is meaningless .",
    "this establishes that the instability of the static black holes in the @xmath19-dimensional massive gravity originates from the massiveness , but not a nature of the fourth - order gravity giving ghost states .",
    "also , the unstable condition of ( [ int - con ] ) explains that choosing the graviton mass above the three - dimensional bf bound but below the gl instability bound has made the btz black hole unstable to a formation of massive graviton which is regular at horizon and infinity .",
    "this is similar to two instabilities of ads black holes to realize a holographic superconductor phase in the bulk within the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the 4d black string is stable under the @xmath0-mode metric perturbation in einstein gravity  @xcite , while the btz black hole is unstable in the new massive gravity .",
