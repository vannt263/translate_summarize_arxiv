    "there has been considerable success in detecting the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the universe .",
    "they are the black holes ( bh ) with masses in the range @xmath0 , called so to distinguish them from the stellar mass black holes produced by the death of massive stars .",
    "there is no dearth of stellar - mass ( @xmath1 ) black holes either ; by some estimates there may be @xmath2 in every galaxy ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; brown & bethe 1994 ) .",
    "black holes with masses in the range @xmath3 , appropriately called the intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , however , remain a mystery .",
    "imbhs have persistently evaded discovery in spite of considerable theoretical and observational efforts .",
    "dense star clusters , such as globular clusters , have long been suspected as possible sites for the formation of imbhs .",
    "the idea that some , if not all , globular clusters can host a central black hole actually preceedes the notion of the supermassive black holes @xcite , and more than thirty years ago attempts were made to discover them by their x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "hunting for globular - cluster black holes was recognized as a task suited for _ hst _ s exquisite resolution which is needed to look close to a black hole .",
    "this idea was restimulated by the capability of _ chandra x - ray observatory _ to resolve sensitively the x - ray emission from the very centres of globular clusters ; and recent detection of x - ray emission in the globular cluster g1 in m31 @xcite provided additional clue to the existence of an imbh in this cluster .",
    "the growing evidence that some galactic globular clusters could harbour central black holes , just as galaxies do , stimulates the searches and development of new methods for proving their existence .",
    "portegies & mcmillan ( 2002 ) showed that a runaway merger among the most massive stars in the globular cluster leads to the formation of an imbh , provided that the core collapse proceeds faster than their main - sequence lifetime . for a globular cluster that evolves in the galactic tidal field ,",
    "the corresponding present - day half - mass relaxation time would have to be @xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "many of the milky way globular clusters have half - mass relaxation times in the range @xmath5 years , and some below @xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "another possible way for the formation of imbhs in globular clusters is through the repeated merging of compact objects , if , for example , a single @xmath6 bh were initially somewhere in the cluster , it would sink to the centre through dynamical friction , and slowly grow in mass through merging with stellar - mass black holes @xcite . clusters with central densities @xmath7 pc@xmath8 will have high enough encounter rates to produce @xmath3 bhs . in the milky way it would imply that roughly 40% of globulars could host such objects .",
    "other , more exotic scenarios were suggested , such as direct collapse of population iii stars and subsequent growth by accretion @xcite , or the accretion of supernovae winds funneled by radiation drag exerted by stars on the interstellar medium , onto the cluster centre , forming the central massive object which eventually collapses to form an imbh @xcite . while the first scenario does not require the host stellar system to be dense , the latter rules out the formation of the central bhs in most of the present - day galactic gcs on the basis of their insufficient total mass and/or central velocity dispersion .",
    "several gcs were suggested to harbour imbhs at their centres .",
    "the main evidence comes from the analysis of the central velocity dispersions of some gcs , and , in some cases , from the presence of a rotation in the core",
    ". suggested upper limits of radio emission from low luminosity imbhs in gcs ( maccarone et al . 2005 ) have led to upper estimates of the central bh mass in two nearby galactic gcs , 47 tuc and ngc 6397 .",
    "detection of radio ( ulvestad et al . 2007 ) and x - ray ( pooley & rappaport 2006 ) from the gc g1 in m31 also supports the previous claims of gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that it hosts a central bh .",
    "these imbhs lie on the extrapolated @xmath9 relation found for smbhs in galactic nuclei ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : correlations ] ) , and this leads to a prediction of a central mass of @xmath10 for a typical globular cluster having a velocity dispersion of the order of 10 km / sec ..    despite the observational evidence of imbh in gcs , there remains considerable debate about whether the reported excess of mass in the centres of gcs can be well modelled by a cluster of low - mass objects , such as white dwarfs ( wd ) , neutron stars ( ns ) or stellar - mass bhs , rather than an imbh @xcite .",
    "none of the existing methods can distinguish between these two alternatives , mainly because the fitting procedure is relatively insensitive to the precise nature of the dark matter contained within the innermost region of the cluster @xcite .",
    "detection of gravitational waves from an imbh can be a potential method for resolving this argument , but for that the central imbh has to be a binary and at final stages of coalescence . _ gravitational microlensing _ of a background star by the central black hole , on the other hand , can in principle be a clear diagnostic tool as there is a significant difference in the lensing signatures of a single point - mass lens ( a single imbh ) , a binary lens , and , most importantly , of an ensemble of point - mass lenses ( which would be the case if the central mass consisted of a conglomeration of low - mass objects ) .",
    "thus the detection of a lensed signal in the centre of a gc can resolve the controversy about the nature of a central dark mass detected in some globulars and prove beyond doubt the existence of imbh in gcs .",
    "paczynski ( 1994 ) was the first to suggest that lensing of stars in smc or galactic bulge can reveal compact objects in foreground gcs .",
    "however it was found that the probability of such events is low and moreover such clusters are too few .",
    "it was also suggested to use gc stars as sources for halo lenses to distinguish between different galactic halo models ( gyuk & holder 1998 ; rhoads & malhotra 1998 ) .",
    "this would require monitoring each stars in a globular cluster or on average over all globular clusters about 60,000 stars .",
    "both suggested methods would need very powerful telescopes with high resolution imaging .    in this paper",
    "we propose to consider the microlensing events that are expected when globular cluster stars pass behind the central bh that acts as a lens , inducing amplification of light .",
    "we show here that by observing enough number of globular clusters there is a chance to prove the existence of an imbh .",
    "this method removes some of the ambiguities usually present in the galactic microlensing events , because in gcs the location of both the lens and the source , and their velocities are well constrained .",
    "according to standard microlensing theory , when a background source is sufficiently close to the line of sight to a lens , its apparent brightness is increased by the factor a=,u^2(t)=u^2_min+()^2 , where @xmath11 is the impact parameter in terms of the einstein radius , @xmath12 is the time at which maximum amplification occurs , and @xmath13 is the time it takes the source to move across the einstein radius , which is given by r_e=^1/2 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the observer - source , observer - lens and lens - source distances , respectively , and @xmath17 is the mass of the lens ( black hole ) . * the resulting light curve is symmetric around @xmath12 and achromatic ( the light curve shape is independent of wavelength)*. we take the duration of the microlensing event @xmath13 as the time it takes a source to cross the einstein radius , t_e= , [ eq : duration ] where @xmath18 is the relative two - dimenstional transverse speed , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the components of the source velocity perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the optical depth of the microlensing is the probability that a background source lies inside the einstein radius of the lens , = r_e^2n(r ) dr , [ eq : tau ] where @xmath22 is the number density of the sources .",
    "we distinguish two types of microlensing in globular clusters : lensing of gc stars by the central imbh and self - lensing of gc stars by the stars in the same cluster .      in the case when both the source and the lens are situated in the globular cluster we have @xmath23 , and",
    "the einstein radius is r_e(2.8 au)()^1/2 ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "the calculation of the optical depth in this case is a little bit different from the conventional one .",
    "here we have a lens whose einstein radius is a function of the distance @xmath24 between the lens and a background source star , @xmath25 .",
    "for an observer far away from the lens we consider a * cone * with a cross - section of * @xmath26 * and a length @xmath16 . * the probability that at any given instant there is a star inside the lensing cross - section is * dn_event = r_e^2(r ) dr , [ number ] where @xmath27 is the density of gc and @xmath28 is the average mass of stars , which we assume to be equal to the solar mass . integrating over @xmath24 * gives the number of ongoing microlensing events , @xmath29 at any given instant*. unlike the standard optical depth ( eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] ) , this optical depth depends on the sources mass function .",
    "* for the mass distribution in globular clusters we use the plummer density profile * @xcite , ( r)=_0 , [ cgmodel ] where @xmath30 is the central mass density and @xmath31 the core radius .",
    "as an illustration we give here the details of calculations for m15 , a globular cluster for which a central black hole mass of @xmath32 was given as the most probable value @xcite .",
    "for m15 , @xmath33 pc@xmath8 @xcite and @xmath34 pc @xcite , eq .  [ number ] gives the number of microlensing events as @xmath35 .",
    "this would mean that monitoring the centres of about @xmath36 globular clusters * theoretically * gives a ten percent chance of seeing a microlensing event in progress .    in order to estimate the number of events during a given observational time @xmath37",

    "[ cgmodel ] for the distribution of the matter in gc , the number of microlensing events within one year of observations is @xmath42 .",
    "we may expect that by observing @xmath43 clusters similar to m15 for ten years , one can detect one microlensing event due to the imbh .",
    "we assume that the two components of @xmath44 are normally disrtributed .",
    "the probability that the velocity is in the range @xmath44 and @xmath45 is given by dp(v_x , v_y ) = dv_xdv_y .",
    "[ eq : prob ] due to cylindrical symmetry , we integrate this probability in the azimuthal direction to obtain dp(v ) = dv , [ eq : prob1 ] where @xmath46 .",
    "it can be easily verified that the most probable speed is @xmath47 .    to estimate the mean duration of events we divide the mean einstein radius r_e= by the the most probable speed @xmath47 of stars in the cluster , t_e= , [ eq : t_e ] where @xmath48 is the probability of a star to be inside the einstein ring .",
    "for example in the case of m15 , the mean einstein radius is 2.07 au , and with the central velocity dispersion @xmath49 km / sec , the mean duration of event is @xmath50 days .",
    "apart from the mean duration of events , we can also obtain the distribution of event time - scales .",
    "for this purpose let us denote the event time - scale corresponding to @xmath51 as @xmath52 and its inverse function as @xmath53 .",

    "one of the characteristics of the self - lensing inside the gc is that the einstein radius is about @xmath75 times smaller than that of imbh and so we expect the duration of self - lensing events to be of the order @xmath76 days .",
    "it has been widely believed that middle - range black holes can only reside in the most centrally concentrated clusters , with density profile very close to that predicted for the core - collapse .",

    "however , it was argued ( baumgardt et al . 2005 ) that , on the contrary , no core - collapsed cluster can harbour a central bh , as it would quickly puff up the core by enhancing the rate of close encounters , and one has to look for the clusters with large core radius and just a slight slope of the density profile in the core region .",
    "this was further reinforced by miocchi ( 2007 ) , who , however , made several assumptions that do not reflect realistic cluster models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many of the previously thought core - collapsed ( or post - core - collapsed ; pcc ) clusters were recently shown to posses cores , and king models also appeared to poorly represent most globulars in their cores @xcite .",

    "we see that our sample of clusters is concentrated in a small area of the plot and , as far as this distribution is concerned , there is no considerable difference between the baumgardt set and cc set .",
    "it was noticed @xcite that to the extent that a massive , bound cluster can be viewed as a ` mini - bulge ' , it may be that every dense stellar system ( small or large ) hosts a central black hole .",
    "it is possible that there may be some previously unrecognized connection between the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their central black holes .",

    "it was proposed on the basis of n - body simulations of realistic mutli - mass star clusters that central imbh speeds up the dissolution of a star cluster , especially if a cluster is surrounded by a tidal field .",
    "this would rule out the presence of central imbh in bd and oh population , though not in yh . however , one yh cluster with reported central black hole is a core - collapsed cluster m15 and core - collapsed clusters are also ruled out by baumgardt et al .",

    "ideally , we would monitor all galactic globular clusters .",
    "however , in practice it is a very difficult task . even in our selected candidates list ( table 1 ) it is found that the optical depth varies considerably .",
    "besides , the tentative results of sec .  [ sec : classification ] show that it might be useless to look for diffuse , faint and distant clusters . moreover , in pcc clusters , if we take into account the mass segregation effect , and/or a mass distribution law more concentrated towards the centre , a @xmath91 profile , the lensing rate increases . for example ,",

    "no star not belonging to a cluster can be a source , thus even if the source is not directly detected , its tranverse velocity is within the range of cluster s velocity dispersion ( sect . 2.2 ) .",
    "the same is true for the distance to the source ; distance to the lens is assumed to the cluster distance .",
    "moreover , lens mass is constrained theoretically ( sect .",

    "* globular clusters contain very few cvs and especially erupting cvs , which may mimic microlensing events ( della valle & livio 1996 ) .",
    "the total number as of 2007 was 12 dn in 7 galactic globular clusters .",
    "the light curves of variable stars are much different from symmetric and achromatic paczynski ( 1986 ) curves shown by lensing events .",
    "most stellar variables are normally bluer when they are at maxmimum flux ( sterken & jaschek 1996 ) . thus by carrying out two colour photometry in v and i bands , and by fitting the observed light curves to a paczynski curve , variable stellar sources that may cause contamination can be removed . *",
    "the estimated timescales of gc ml events are of the order of a year , whereas , most of the .",
    "variable stars in gcs have short periods ( @xmath109 100 days ) . *",
    "therefore , by analysing the observed candidate light curves for the abovementioned properties , contaminating stellar variables can be efficiently removed from genuine ml events*.    self - lensing events may present a challenge due to its higher event rate ( sec .",
    "* however , as far as competition between imbh and self - lensing is concerned , the probabilities are very different",
    ". the probability of self - lensing does not depend as drastically on the radial distance as the imbh lensing .",
    "if we consider a tube going through the gc centre and having , for example , a radius = core radius ( which is much more than the radius of an imbh influence ) , the ratio of self - lensing probabilities would roughly go as @xmath110 , which shows immediately how negligible it would be in the centre .",
    "stars behind the cluster centre can not contribute to self - lensing optical depth , any self - lensing event there would only contribute to the photometric noise .",
    "also , contrary to the tentative conclusion on the choice of gc to look for imbh lensing , the less centrally concentrated , loose and diffuse clusters are more favoured for self - lensing search , and such clusters are excluded from our current proposal . * in adddition , self - lensing time scales are of the order of days ( see section 2.3 ) , compared to the year - long time scales of gc ml events ( see bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : timeeveprob ] ) .",
    "gc stars can also be affected by microlensing due to compact matter in the milky way not associated to a globular cluster . however , in such cases , the lens transverse velocity is set to that of the galactic disk rotation , @xmath111 km / sec , which would give the typical timescale of event @xmath112 days . such events too will occupy a separate region on the amplitude - duration diagram and again can be easily distinguised from long duration ml events and eliminated .",
    "determining whether globular clusters contain imbhs is a key problem in astronomy .",
    "they may contribute as much as @xmath113 to the cosmic baryon budget .",
    "their cosmic mass density could exceed that of supermassive bhs ( @xmath114 ) and the observations do not even rule out that they may account for all the baryonic dark matter in the universe ( @xmath115 ) @xcite .",
    "they also may have profound influence on the evolution and survival of globular clusters . in this paper",
    ", we have outlined the novel technique for using microlensing to detect imbh in the centres of gcs .",
    "we suggest that dense and hight luminosity gcs are better suited to search for imbh than diffuse and low luminosity gcs .",
    "the oh , bd and sc clusters are the most likely ones .",
    "our suggested monitoring programme of observing @xmath116100 clusters over a 10 year baseline with a time resolution of 1 observation per month will permit detection of one ml event .",
    "such a monitoring programme is feasible on any dedicated 2 m class telescope involved solely in monitoring astronomical sources .",
    "all the potential contaminants to this lensing signal ( section 3.4 ) , can be easily identified and eliminated from the true ml events .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her helpful comments .",
    "m.  s. would like to thank sohrab rahvar with whom this project has started .",
    "authors would also like to thank the indian institute of astrophysics and especially our observatories tacs for providing us with the opportunity to start the project .",
