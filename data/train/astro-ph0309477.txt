    "what we will call _ starburst _ radio galaxies in this brief review are radio sources hosted by galaxies that spectroscopically show a young stellar population component in addition to the old component typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "these objects are now known to represent a significant fraction of samples of radio galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "their relevance , and the motivation for our study , has to do with the more general and important question of what is the origin and evolution of radio galaxies .    from imaging studies of powerful radio galaxies ( heckman et al.1986 ) ,",
    "there is clear morphological evidence that their host galaxies have undergone interactions and/or mergers .",
    "because of this , it has been suggested that these phenomena are in fact responsible for the onset of the radio sources . in this scenario",
    "it is not too surprising that starformation is also triggered by the same merging event .",
    "the presence of a young stellar population has an other important implication : it could represent the origin of the uv excess found to be typical of radio galaxies compared to normal ellipticals ( lilly & longair 1984 ) - as alternative to the anisotropic scattering model of the quasar radiation ( see e.g. tadhunter , fosbury & di serego alighieri 1988 ) .    until not so long ago",
    ", only a handful of radio galaxies were known , from optical spectroscopy , to have a young stellar population in their nuclear regions ( see e.g.  3c  321 tadhunter et al .",
    "1996 , hydra  a melnick et al .",
    "1997 ) . given the importance of understanding how common this is , we have recently undergone systematic studies of the stellar population in radio galaxies ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2002 , wills et al .",
    "2002 ) . because in radio galaxies key absorption features ( sensitive to the presence of young stellar population ) are in most cases filled in by strong emission lines , the study of the stellar population is better done using the modelling of the entire continuum sed ( see tadhunter et al .",
    "1996 for more details ) .",
    "the results show that a young stellar population component is present in at least 30% of radio galaxies .",
    "the typical ages of the young stars is between 0.5 and 2 gyr .",
    "interestingly , the galaxies showing this component are also the most luminous in the far - ir , indicating a link between the optical starburst and the far - ir emission .",
    "this relatively large fraction is also consistent with the results obtained - using hst - from the uv morphology of powerful 3cr radio galaxies , where clear regions of starformation are often observed ( allen et al .",
    "_ these results support the idea of a merger origin for radio galaxies and suggest that , at least some of them , had an ( ultra- ) luminous far - ir galaxy as progenitor ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2002 , wills et al.2002)_. the results also indicate that the activity starts late after the merger event .",
    "the existence of galaxies where this young stellar component is not observed indicates that , if they are merger related , they are observed at a later stage and/or they originate from _ other type _ of mergers . in summary , the study of _ starburst _ radio galaxies provides important clues on the origin and evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "as we will see below , the study of the neutral hydrogen in _ starburst _ radio galaxies gives complementary information to that provided by the optical stellar population .",
    "neutral hydrogen has the main advantage that it traces the large - scale distribution of the gas as well as the ism conditions in the nuclear regions near the agn .",
    "preliminary results show that in _ starburst _",
    "radio galaxies the presence of  - mainly , but not only , detected in absorption against the central regions - is more common compared to other radio galaxies ( morganti et al .  2001 ) and this has motivated the studies that will be reviewed here .",
    "figure 2a , b , c in separate .gif files",
    "detected at large radii ( tens of kpc ) is a long - lived signature of a merger / interaction and therefore provides a key diagnostic of how a galaxy formed .",
    "large - scale  structures have been found in a growing number of nearby `` normal '' ( i.e.  radio quiet ) early - type galaxies ( see e.g.  oosterloo et al .",
    "2002 ) and in many cases the likely origin is a major - merger event . _ what is ( if any ) the relation between these gas - rich systems and radio galaxies ? _ if radio galaxies - and in particular _ starburst _ radio galaxies - indeed originate from ( major ) mergers , and the radio activity is just a short phase in the evolution of the host galaxy , fossil large - scale  structures similar to those detected in `` normal '' early - type might be expected .    a systematic study of the occurrence of large  structures in radio galaxies , and _ starburst _ radio galaxies ( to be compared with the results for normal galaxies of similar type ) is now in progress ( emonts et al .  in prep ) .",
    "the results may also shed some light on the importance of the initial conditions and/or environment for the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that the capability of a merger to bring gas into the nuclear ( pc ) regions - and therefore produce an agn - depends on the structure ( e.g.  the presence of a bulge ) of the progenitor ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "although we do not have yet complete statistics , here we present the results for two interesting cases of _ starburst _ radio galaxies that we have recently studied .",
    "first , however , lets summarise briefly what has been found so far for `` normal '' early - type galaxies .      a recent systematic study of  in all southern rc3 early - type galaxies detected by the hipass survey ( see oosterloo et al .",
    "2003 for details ) , has brought to some surprising and interesting results . among the detected galaxies ( between 6 and 14 % depending on the optical classification ) a wide range of  morphologies is found , but a surprisingly large fraction shows huge structures ( many tens of kpc and up to 200 kpc ) in the form of regularly rotating disks containing a large amount of  ( @xmath2 @xmath1 ) .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "similar structures previously observed in other early - type galaxies ( morganti et al .",
    "1997 , oosterloo et al .",
    "2002 ) were explained as originating from a major - merger event involving at least one gas - rich disk galaxy .",
    "given that the appears often quite settled , the gas must have already completed at least few orbits ( @xmath3 yr ) and the merger must be relatively old . actually , for the huge  structures shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "a few orbits in the outer regions of the disk already imply extremely long timescales ( several times @xmath4 yr ) , that may not be always easy to reconcile with the merger hypothesis . from the observed parameters a `` first - order '' evolution sequence",
    "can be build to connect these objects ( e.g.  ngc  5266 morganti et al .",
    "1997 ) with well - known major mergers that are observed in an initial phase ( e.g.  ngc  7252 or the antennae ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 , hibbard et al .",
    "2001 respectively ) .",
    "there are only an handful of very nearby radio galaxies where large - scale  structures have been detected so far : for example pks b1718 - 649 ( vron - cetty et al .",
    "1995 ) , centaurus  a ( schiminovich et al .  1994 and refs therein ) and , at lower radio power , ngc  4278 ( raimond et al .  1981 ) and ngc  1052 ( van gorkom et al .",
    "in addition to these , coma a was the first case where in a powerful radio galaxy a large  structure was detected in absorption ( morganti et al .",
    "it is interesting that in our study of  in starburst radio galaxies we have found already two more interesting cases of extended  - one detected in emission and one in absorption .    in the nearby ( @xmath5 ) _ starburst _ radio galaxy b2  0648 + 27 ,",
    "is detected - using the wsrt - both in emission and in absorption ( morganti et al .",
    "2003a ) . in emission",
    ", we detect a large amount of  ( @xmath6 @xmath1 ) distributed in a very extended disk , or ring - like structure , of about 160 kpc in size , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "we also detect  absorption against the central radio continuum component .",
    "the characteristics of the detected , and the similarities with some of the `` normal '' elliptical mentioned above , are explained as the result of a major merger .",
    "the structure of the  and the asymmetric density distribution , however , suggest that the  is not yet in a completely settled configuration",
    ". we can derive a rough indication of the age of the merger of at least few times @xmath7 yr and it may represent a merger in an intermediate stage ( morganti et al .",
    "2003a ) : between major mergers in their early phase - like the antennae - and galaxies with more settled  structures like , e.g. , ngc  5266 ( morganti et al .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "interestingly , the radio source shows all the characteristics of being much younger ( compact and steep spectrum , see odea 1998 for a review ) , @xmath8 yrs old .",
    "this supports the idea that the radio source appears late after the merger but also that , under favourable conditions , the  gas can stay around for very long time .",
    "indeed , it is interesting to note that in b2  0648 + 27 , as in the other systems mentioned above , the column density of the  detected in emission is relatively low ( only @xmath9 @xmath10pc@xmath11 ) as in the other gas - rich elliptical galaxies ( see e.g.oosterloo et al .",
    "therefore , no significant star formation is , at present , occurring in the regions coincident with the .",
    "the galaxy can , therefore , remain gas rich for a very long period .    figure 4 in a separate",
    ".gif file    a different case appears to be 3c  433 .",
    "extended  in absorption has been observed against the southern radio lobe of this _ starburst _ radio galaxy . the preliminary analysis of the data ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows that @xmath12 @xmath1  of ( extended )  is detected in absorption at about 60 kpc from the radio core .",
    "the gas shows a velocity gradient , but at the moment it is not clear whether the detected  is part of an extended gas disk / tail or whether it corresponds to a region of interaction between the ism and the radio lobe .",
    "given the smaller amount of  detected in this object , the origin of this galaxy might be different from the major - merger suggested for b2  0648 + 27 .",
    "it is interesting to note that 3c  433 is part of a dumbbell system ( parma et al .",
    "1991 ) and has a relatively young stellar population ( 0.1 gyr , wills et al .",
    "2002 ) .    at the moment information on large - scale",
    "is limited to only two objects , but our aim is to extend this study to many more radio galaxies and to be able to identify possible trends .",
    "figure 5 in a separate .gif file",
    "at small radii ( @xmath13 kpc , i.e.   nuclear scales ) has been detected in absorption against the strong radio continuum in many radio galaxies in a number of studies ( e.g.   vermeulen et al .",
    "2003 , morganti et al .",
    "2001 and refs therein for previous studies ) .",
    "this neutral hydrogen has been often associated with gas distributed in a nuclear disk or torus .",
    "however , recent observations indicate that such an interpretation can not always be applied and the situation can be much more complex ( morganti 2002b and refs therein ) .    in this respect ,",
    "our initial results on  in the central region of _ starburst _ radio galaxies are interesting .",
    "in particular , the combined study of the ionized and the neutral gas has revealed to be crucial for the understanding of the physical conditions of the ism in the central regions of radio galaxies .",
    "a clear example is the southern , _ starburst _ radio galaxy pks  1549 - 79 . in this object ,",
    "two redshift systems of ionized gas were found ( tadhunter et al .",
    "the  absorption has the same redshift as the low ionisation gas , while the high ionisation gas appears blueshifted respect to it .",
    "the  absorption is associated with a cocoon of material surrounding the tiny ( @xmath14 pc in size ) radio source .",
    "the material is believed to be left over from the event that triggered the radio source .",
    "the highly ionized material is instead associated with a nuclear outflows .",
    "even more intriguing is the discovery , in at least two _ starburst _ radio galaxies , that the presence of fast outflows is associated not only with ionized gas but also _ with neutral _ gas .",
    "this finding gives new and important insights on the physical conditions of the gaseous medium around an agn .",
    "a good example is the young , _ starburst _ radio galaxy , 4c  12.50 .",
    "the fast  outflow was detected using the broad band ( 20  mhz ) system now available at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) . due to the much stronger radio continuum of this radio galaxy , detection of gas at very low optical depth",
    "is possible .",
    "4c  12.50 is a particularly interesting object as it is a prime candidate for the link between ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) and radio galaxies ( evans et al .",
    "the radio source is confined to a region @xmath15 arcsec ( @xmath16 pc ) and has all the characteristics of young radio sources ( @xmath8 yr ) .",
    "the ism of this radio galaxy is extremely rich : it is the most far - ir bright radio galaxy and has a high molecular gas mass ( evans et al .",
    "a `` stratified '' fast outflow of the highly ionized gas , that is quite similar to that detected in pks 1549@xmath1779 , has been detected by holt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in fig .",
    "6a is presented the  absorption detected with the wsrt .",
    "the absorption appears clearly complex and _ extremely broad_. the full range of velocities covered by the  absorption is @xmath18 @xmath19km@xmath19s@xmath20 , _ the broadest detected so far in _ .",
    "the peak optical depth of the broad component is only @xmath21 and the column density of the full system of shallow absorption ( assuming a covering factor is 1 ) is @xmath22 cm@xmath11 .    a similar situation ( fast outflow of both ionized and neutral gas ) is also seen in the _ starburst _ radio galaxy 3c  293 that , although it is not classified as young , is nevertheless believed to have recently experienced a restarting radio activity ( see also emonts et al .",
    "these proceedings ) . again using the new broad band ( 20  mhz ) system available at the wsrt , broad , mainly blueshifted , absorption has been detected ( see morganti et al .",
    "2003b and emonts et al .  these proceedings for details ) .",
    "the absorption profile is shown in fig .",
    "the broad  absorption has a full - width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of @xmath24 @xmath19km@xmath19s@xmath20 .",
    "it is very shallow , with a typical optical depth of only @xmath25 , and , assuming a covering factor is 1 , a column density of the  is @xmath26 k cm@xmath11 . as in the case of 4c  12.50 , this gives a lower limit to the true column density as the @xmath27 associated with such a fast outflow can be as large as a few 1000  k ( instead of 100  k which is more typical of the cold , quiescent  in galaxy disks ) .",
    "these two galaxies are the first examples of radio galaxies where a fast  outflow is observed , but more candidates exist among _ starburst _ radio galaxies .",
    "this result shows that , despite the extremely energetic phenomena occurring near an agn - including the powerful radio jet - some of the outflowing gas remains , or becomes again , neutral .",
    "outflows of ionized gas appear to be a relatively common characteristic in agn and starburst galaxies ( as also illustrated by a number of talks in this conference ) .",
    "fast gas outflows are now detected ( in optical , uv and x - ray observations ) in a wide range of agns , from seyfert galaxies to quasars ( see e.g.  crenshaw et al.2001 ; turnshek 1986 ; krongold et al .",
    "2003 and refs therein ) .",
    "these outflows can be produced by different and highly energetic phenomena , such as interaction of the radio plasma with the ism as well as nuclear and/or starburst winds .",
    "it is interesting to see that outflows have been also detected in , but so far are only found in _",
    "starburst _ radio galaxies .",
    "this might be due to the presence of a particularly rich ism that characterises radio galaxies in this stage of their evolution , with the rich ism possibly resulting from a recent merger .",
    "the central question is how _ neutral _ gas can be associated with such fast outflows .",
    "a possible model is that the radio plasma jet hits a ( molecular ) cloud in the ism . as a consequence of this interaction , the kinematics of the gas",
    "is disturbed by the shock and perhaps part of the gas is also ionized by it .",
    "once the shock has passed , part of the gas may have the chance to recombine and become neutral , while it is moving at high velocities ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in the model proposed by mellema et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as the shock runs over a cloud , a compression phase starts because the cloud gets embedded in an overpressured cocoon .",
    "the shock waves start travelling _ into _ the cloud and the cloud fragments with the fragments moving at high velocities .",
    "the cooling times for the dense fragments are very short ( few times @xmath28 years ) compared to the lifetime of the radio source and that the excess of energy is quickly radiated away .",
    "this results in the _ formation of dense , cool and fragmented structures at high velocities_.    as indirect support to this hypothesis , it is worth mentioning that in the only other case of broad blueshifted  absorption ( of 700 @xmath19km@xmath19s@xmath20fwzi ) studied in detail so far , the seyfert galaxy ic  5063 ( oosterloo et al .",
    "2000 ) , the  absorption is coincident with the brighter radio lobe where also the most kinematically disturbed ionized gas is observed .",
    "this supports the idea of jet / cloud interaction as most likely mechanism in this seyfert galaxy .",
    "another possible example is the seyfert galaxy mrk  1 ( omar et al .  2002 ) .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether with the mechanism proposed above it is really possible to accelerate the clouds to the high velocities observed .",
    "therefore , other possibilities should be considered :    _ i ) starburst : _ given the presence of a young stellar population in these galaxies , a starburst wind capable to accelerate the gas should be considered to explain the  outflow .",
    "this mechanism is indeed known to produce fast outflow at least of ionized gas ( see e.g.  heckman , armus & miley 1990 , and veilleux these proceedings ) .",
    "however , in the case of _ starburst _ radio galaxies the age of the young stellar population component has been estimated between 0.4 and 2.5 gyr .",
    "thus , the neutral outflow would have to be a `` fossil '' starburst - driven wind from the strong starburst that may have occurred of the order of 1 gyr ago . given this condition ,",
    "it is not clear whether the starburst - driven outflow would survive to the present day and , more important , whether it would be still seen against the central regions .    _",
    "ii ) radiation pressure from the agn : _ dopita et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have explored the possibility that the narrow - line regions in active galaxies are actually dusty and that the radiation pressure acting over the dust could produce the extreme kinematics observed in the ionized gas . in their model",
    "they consider a dusty ( radiation pressure - dominated ) region surrounding a ( photoevaporating ) molecular cloud .",
    "in this scenario , the dust is estimated to survive as the average gas temperature does not exceed @xmath29  unlike the case of fast shocks  and it will not destroy the grains in the short time during the passage through the high - emissivity region . while for 4c  12.50 the strong agn suggest that this mechanism could be considered as an option , in 3c  293 , the very low ionisation and faint emission lines suggest that the uv radiation from the agn is not that strong and therefore unlikely to provide the necessary pressure to produce the outflow .    _",
    "iii ) _ a further possibility is that the  outflow is associated to the adiabatically expanded broad emission line clouds ( belcs ) as suggested by elvis et al .",
    "following their work , if the broad emission line region is outflowing , then the belcs will expand and cool adiabatically , and will reach 1000  k at @xmath13 few pc .",
    "they will then form dust and also neutral hydrogen but in this case the  outflow has to be located very close to the nucleus .    in summary , in order to identify",
    "which mechanism is the more likely to accelerate the gas , the exact location of the broad  absorption is needed and vlbi follow - up observations are now in progress .",
    "in this review we have shown that the group of _ starburst _ radio galaxies is a particularly interesting one in order to understand the origin and evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "the study of neutral hydrogen in this group of objects is also giving us important clues about these open questions .",
    "appears to be relatively common in starburst radio galaxies ( at least compared to other radio galaxies ) .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that large amount of gas is still around from the merger that triggers the radio source .",
    "we have presented two cases in which extended  has been detected .",
    "the case of b2  0648 + 27 represents one of the largest  disks known ( @xmath30 kpc ) around a radio galaxy with more than @xmath31@xmath1of .",
    "it shows that at least some radio galaxies are likely the results of major mergers and that the agn activity appears late after the merger .",
    "even more surprising is the finding of fast  outflows in at least two _ starburst _ radio galaxies .",
    "this result shows that , despite the extremely energetic phenomena occurring near an agn - including the powerful radio jet - some of the outflowing gas remains , or becomes again , neutral .",
    "this can give new and important insights on the physical conditions of the gaseous medium around an agn .",
    "following these results , a tantalising connection can be made with the high-@xmath32 radio galaxies .",
    "as in the _ starburst _ radio galaxies presented here , there is clear evidence for the presence of large amounts of cold gas and , in general , for the presence of a rich gaseous environment in radio galaxies at high redshift ( see e.g.  van breugel 2000 for a review ) . particularly relevant",
    "is the finding ( villar - marti et al .",
    "2002 ) of a low surface brightness ly@xmath33 halo with quiescent kinematics in the case of the high-@xmath32 radio galaxy uss  0828 + 193 .",
    "one possible way suggested to explain this structure is that the low surface brightness ly@xmath33 halo is the progenitor of the  discs as found in the case of b2  0648 + 27 and others discussed above .",
    "if this is the case , the wealth of details that we can learn at low-@xmath32 may be crucial for understanding the structures at high-@xmath32 .",
    "moreover , strong interactions between the radio plasma and the medium are expected to be very important in high-@xmath32 objects .",
    "outflow phenomena have been detected in many high - redshift radio galaxies . in many cases ,",
    "asymmetric ly@xmath33 profiles suggest the presence of blueshifted absorbing gas ( likely neutral hydrogen ; see van ojik et al .",
    "1997 , de breuck et al.1999 ) .",
    "additionally , complex gas kinematics is also observed in a large fraction of high-@xmath32 radio galaxies ( van ojik et al .",
    "thus , similar processes as observed in 4c  12.50 and 3c  293 are likely to be even more common in these high-@xmath32 systems .",
    "understanding the physics of fast gas outflows and the conditions for which part of the outflowing gas is neutral , can be also relevant for understanding high-@xmath32 objects .",
