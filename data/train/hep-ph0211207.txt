    "understanding the origin of electro - weak symmetry breaking and mass generation stands as a central theme of the research programme in physics in the coming decades .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) , successfully tested to an unprecedented level of accuracy by the lep and slc experiments , and now also by the @xmath1-factories , addresses this question with the higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the first manifestation of the higgs mechanism through the higgs sector is the existence of at least one higgs boson , @xmath2 .",
    "the observation of a new spin-0 particle would represent a first sign that the higgs mechanism of mass generation is realised in nature .",
    "present data indicates that it is heavier than 114  gev and possibly lighter than about 195  gev  @xcite .",
    "we expect the higgs boson to be discovered at the tevatron or at the lhc , the cern hadron collider , which will determine its mass and perform a first survey of its basic properties . a tev - class linear collider ,",
    "operating at centre - of - mass energies 350  gev@xmath3  1  tev , will bring the accuracy needed to further validate this picture and to probe the sm or extended nature of the higgs sector .",
    "it will perform crucial measurements in a model - independent way and it will also complement the lhc in the search for heavy higgs bosons . their observation would provide direct evidence that nature has chosen a route different than the minimal higgs sector of the sm .",
    "but neither the precision study of the higgs profile nor the search for additional higgs bosons will be completed at energies below 1  tev",
    ". there are measurements which will be limited in accuracy or may be not feasible at all , due to limitations in both the available statistics and centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the two - beam acceleration scheme , presently developed within the clic study  @xcite at cern , aims at collisions at @xmath4=3 - 5  tev , representing a unique opportunity to extend @xmath0 physics to constituent energies of the order of the lhc energy frontier , and beyond , with very high luminosity .",
    "it is therefore important to assess the potential of a multi - tev lc in complementing information that the lhc , and possibly a lower energy lc , will obtain .",
    "the tev - class lc will perform highly accurate determinations of the higgs profile .",
    "however , even at the high design luminosity of tesla and the nlc there are properties which can not be tested exhaustively .",
    "in fact , it is essential to ensure that the fundamental test of the scaling of higgs couplings to fermions with their masses @xmath5 can be performed with significant accuracy over a wide range of higgs boson masses and for all particle species . at @xmath6  gev",
    ", the lc will test the couplings to gauge boson , and those to quarks if the higgs boson is light . to complete this program for leptons and intermediate masses of the higgs and to study the higgs boson self - couplings ,",
    "it is necessary to study rare processes , which need higgs samples in excess to @xmath7 events .",
    "as the cross section for @xmath8 production increases with energy as @xmath9 , it dominates at clic energies . the resulting large higgs production rate at @xmath10  3  tev and the expected luminosity , @xmath11  @xmath12s@xmath13 , yield samples of order of 0.5 - 1  @xmath14 decays of sm - like higgs boson in 1 - 2 years ( see figure  [ fig : xsec ] ) .",
    "measuring the muon yukawa coupling by the determination of the @xmath15 branching fraction completes the test of the coupling scaling for gauge bosons , quarks and leptons separately .",
    "this ensures that the observed higgs boson is indeed responsible for the mass generation of all elementary particles . at @xmath4=3  tev ,",
    "the @xmath16 signal can be easily observed and the @xmath17 coupling measured to 4 - 11% accuracy for higgs masses in the range 120  gev  @xmath18  150  gev , with 3  ab@xmath13 .",
    "while the main motivation for experimentation at a multi - tev lc arise from the search of new phenomena , its role in studying the higgs sector will also be crucial in completing the mapping of the @xmath2 boson profile , studying heavy higgs bosons in extended scenarios or explore otherwise the origin of symmetry breaking , if no elementary higgs boson is observed . in this way",
    ", the clic multi - tev lc project ensures a continue competitive @xmath0 physics program through two generation of projects and of physics questions .",
