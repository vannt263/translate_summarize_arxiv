    "the electromagnetic transition form factors ( ffs ) @xmath13 of light pseudoscalar @xmath14 mesons were the subject of much theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite research in recent years . for instance , the cleo collaboration reported about rather precise measurements of the @xmath15 and @xmath1 transition ffs that stimulated interesting theoretical investigations aiming to account for the obtained experimental data within the framework of qcd .",
    "one of the key objectives of such analyses is to model the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons distribution amplitudes ( das ) and , in the @xmath18 case , to extract information on their gluon components .",
    "indeed , it is known that the physical @xmath19 and @xmath17 mesons can be represented as superpositions of a flavor @xmath6 singlet @xmath7 and octet @xmath8 state @xmath20 @xmath21 unlike the octet @xmath8 state , the @xmath6 singlet @xmath7 contains a two - gluon component @xcite , which even absent at the normalization point @xmath22 , appears in the region @xmath23 owing to quark - gluon mixing and renormalization - group evolution of the @xmath7 state da .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath17 mesons ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) receive a gluon contribution due to the gluon content of the @xmath7 state . because the meson - photon transition at leading order ( lo ) is a pure electromagnetic process",

    "contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition ffs , originating from the gluon content of the @xmath19 and @xmath17 mesons , were recently computed @xcite within the framework of the standard hard - scattering approach ( hsa ) of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and estimates of the expansion parameters in the meson das were given .",
    "the gluon contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electromagnetic transition ffs  are subdominant .",
    "but in some exclusive processes , like the @xmath24 meson two - body nonleptonic exclusive and semi - inclusive decays , which involve the @xmath19 and @xmath17 mesons , their gluon contribution can potentially play an essential role in explaining the experimental data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the reason is that in these processes the gluon component of the @xmath19 and @xmath25 mesons contributes to corresponding hard - scattering amplitudes already at lo of perturbative qcd .",

    "in sec .  [ sec : su3f ] we have outlined the key ingredients pertaining to both the standard hsa  as well as the rc  treatment of the transition ffs  @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "let us now turn to a discussion of the main differences between these two approaches , starting with the choice of the scales @xmath68 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is evident that if a physical quantity can be factorized , like eqs.([eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) , then the left - hand side ( lhs ) can not depend on artificial intrinsic scales or on the particular renormalization and factorization schemes adopted .",
    "but at any finite order of qcd perturbation theory , truncation of the corresponding perturbative series will give rise to a dependence on the scales @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as well as on the factorization and renormalization scheme ( for an in - depth discussion of these issues , we refer the reader to the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . because higher - order corrections in perturbative qcd  computations are , as a rule , large for both inclusive and exclusive processes , reliable theoretical predictions require an optimal scale - setting that minimizes higher - order corrections .",
    "typically , the factorization scale enters the nlo  contribution to the hard - scattering amplitude of meson transition or electromagnetic form factors in the form @xmath139 , so that taking @xmath67 equal to @xmath28 eliminates this term .",
    "but in order to analyze the sensitivity of our results to a chosen value of @xmath67 , we shall perform all analytical computations for @xmath140 .",
    "the choice of the renormalization scale is somewhat subtler because this scale enters not only the nlo  contribution , but also as the argument of the running strong coupling @xmath141 . to discuss this question ,",
    "consider first the scale of the strong coupling .",
    "one effective method to solve this problem is the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) scale - setting procedure @xcite . in this framework , a large part of the higher - order corrections ",
    "namely , those originating from the diagrams with quark `` bubbles '' insertions  can be absorbed into the scale of the qcdcoupling constant .",
    "when utilizing this new scale one finds the nlo  correction to be significantly reduced relative to its initial value .",
    "the generalization of the blm  procedure to all orders of perturbative qcd  led to the invention of the rc  method and the ir  renormalon approach ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of inclusive processes",
    ", it was proven by explicit calculation that all - order resummation of diagrams with a chain of ( quark ) bubble insertions into the gluon line gives the same results as the calculation of one - loop feynman diagrams for the quantity under consideration using the qcd running coupling at the vertices .",
    "moreover , the ir  renormalon approach in conjunction with the `` ultraviolet dominance hypothesis '' enables one to estimate higher - twist corrections to a wide range of inclusive processes .",
    "this approach was used for studying ir  renormalon effects in exclusive processes as well .",
    "for instance , @xmath142 corrections to the brodsky - lepage evolution kernel @xmath143 $ ] were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and renormalon - chain contributions to the pseudoscalar meson da and the @xmath144 transition ff were taken into account in @xcite .",
    "similar investigations along this line of thought were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to loop - integration ambiguities , exclusive processes may receive power - behaved contributions from the end point regions due to the integration in a process amplitude over the longitudinal momentum fractions of the involved partons .",
    "in fact , in order to reduce the nlo correction , for example , to the pion electromagnetic ff @xmath145 , the renormalization scale @xmath68 should be set equal to the typical four - momentum , flowing through hard gluon lines in the partonic subprocess @xmath146 @xcite . choosing the scale @xmath147 this way , inevitably leads to a dependence on the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the hadron s constituents . in the case of @xmath145 ,",
    "the nlo contribution to the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath148 contains a logarithm of the form @xmath149 , with @xmath106 and @xmath150 being , respectively , the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quarks in the initial and the final pion .",
    "hence , the natural choice to eliminate this term would be to set @xmath151 .",
    "but due to the convolution of the hard - scattering with the soft components ( cf.e.g . , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) ) , integrations over @xmath106 and @xmath150 appear that give rise to power corrections when approaching the end point @xmath152 regions . renormalizing the process amplitude at a scale close to the large external momentum",
    "@xmath28 makes such contributions less pronounced but at the expense of large nlo logarithms .",
    "therefore , if we are to optimize our theoretical calculation , we have to minimize nlo contributions while keeping under control power corrections in the end point regions .",
    "specifically , for the meson - photon transition we have @xmath153 because in the corresponding two , leading - order , feynman diagrams the absolute values of the square of the momenta flowing through virtual quark lines are determined exactly by these expressions . in the standard hsa",
    "one `` freezes '' the scale of the qcd coupling constant @xmath68 ( @xmath154 ) , by replacing @xmath106 by its mean value @xmath155 and performs then the integrations in eqs .",

    "let us stay within the hsa and concentrate on the nlo corrections to the quark component of eq .",
