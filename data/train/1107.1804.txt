    "ly@xmath0 photons have been widely applied to study the physics of luminous objects at various epochs of the universe , such as ly@xmath0 emitters , ly@xmath0 blob , damped ly@xmath0 system , ly@xmath0 forest , fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission , star - forming galaxies , quasars at high redshifts as well as optical afterglow of gamma ray bursts ( haiman et al .",

    "the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons with neutral hydrogen atoms has a profound effect on the time , space and frequency dependencies of ly@xmath0 photons transfer in an optically thick medium .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons emergent from an optically thick medium would carry rich information of photon sources and halo surrounding the source of the ly@xmath0 photon .",
    "the profiles of the emission and absorption of the ly@xmath0 radiation are powerful tools to constrain the mass density , velocity , temperature and the fraction of neutral hydrogen of the optically thick medium .",
    "radiation transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in an optically thick medium is fundamentally important .",
    "the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in a medium consisting of neutral hydrogen atoms has been extensively studied either analytically or numerically . yet",
    ", there have been relatively few results which are directly based on the solutions of the integro - differential equation of the resonant radiative transfer . besides the field solution ( field 1959 , rybicki & dellantonio 1994 ) , analytical solutions with and without dust",
    "mostly are based on the fokker - planck ( p - f ) approximation ( harrington 1973 , neufeld 1990 , dijkstra et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the p - f equation might miss the detailed balance relationship of resonant scattering ( rybicki 2006 ) , and therefore , the analytical solutions can not describe the formation and evolution of the wouthuysen - field ( w - f ) local thermalization of the ly@xmath0 photon frequency distribution ( wouthuysen 1952 , field 1958 ) , which is important for the emission and absorption of the hydrogen 21 cm line ( e.g. fang 2009 ) .",
    "the features of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer related to the w - f local thermalization are also missed . an early effort ( adams et al .",
    "1971 ) trying to directly solve the integro - differential equation of the resonant radiative transfer with numerical method .",
    "it still is , however , of a time - independent approximation .",
    "recently , a state - of - the - art numerical method has been introduced to solve the integro - differential equation of the radiative transfer with resonant scattering ( qiu et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , 2008 , roy et al .",
    "the solver is based on the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme ( jiang & shu 1996 ) . with the weno solver , many physical features of the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in an optically thick medium ( roy et al .",
    "2009b , 2009c , 2010 ) , which are missed in the fokker - planck equation approximations , have been revealed .",
    "for instance , the weno solution shows that the time scale of the formation of the w - f local thermal equilibrium actually is only about a few hundred times of the resonant scattering .",
    "it also shows that the double peaked frequency profile of the ly@xmath0 photon emergent from an optically thick medium does not follow the time - independent solutions of the p - f equation .",
    "these results directly indicate the needs of re - visiting problems which have been studied only via the f - p time - independent approximation .",
    "we will investigate , in this paper , the effects of the dust on the ly@xmath0 photons transfer in an optically thick medium .",
    "dust can be produced at epochs of low and moderate redshifts , and even at redshift as high as 6 ( stratta et al .",
    "absorption and scattering of dust have been used to explain the observations on ly@xmath0 emission and absorption ( hummer & kunasz 1980 ) , such as the escaping fraction of ly@xmath0 photons ( hayes et al . 2010 , 2011 ,",
    "blanc et al .",
    "2010 ) ; the redshift - dependence of the ratio between ly@xmath0 emitters and lyman break galaxies ( verhamme et al . 2008 ) ; and the `` evolution '' of the double - peaked profile ( laursen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is still unclear whether the time scale of photon escaping from optically thick halo will be increasing ( or decreasing ) when the halo is dusty .",
    "it is also unclear whether the effects of dust absorption can be estimated by the random walk picture ( hansen & oh 2006 ) . as for the dust effect on the double - peaked profile ,",
    "the current results given by different studies seem to be contradictory : some claims that the dust absorption leads to the narrowing of the double - peaked profile ( lauresen et al 2009 ) , while others result that the width between the two peaks apparently should be increasing due to the dust absorption ( verhamme et al .",
    "we will focus on these basic problems , and examine them with the solution of the integro - differential equation of radiative transfer .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : section 2 presents the theory of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer in an optically thick medium with dust .",
    "the equations of the intensity and flux of resonant photons in a dusty medium are given .",
    "we will study three models of the interaction between dust and photons : ( 1 ) dust causes only scattering with photons ; ( 2 ) dust causes both scattering and absorption ; and ( 3 ) dust causes only absorption of photons .",
    "section 3 gives the solutions of ly@xmath0 photons escaping from an optically thick spherical halos with dust .",
    "the dusty effect on the double - peaked profile will be studied in section 4 . the discussion and conclusion are given in section 5 .",

    "if the absorption and scattering of dust are described by effective cross - section per hydrogen atom @xmath26 , the total optical depth is given by @xmath27 where the dust optical depth @xmath28 .",
    "this is equal to assume that dust is uniformly distributed in igm .",
    "the effects of inhomogeneous density distributions of dust ( neufeld 1991 ; haiman & spaans 1999 ) will not be studied in this paper .",

    "in eq.(3 ) , we use the dimensionless time @xmath36 defined as @xmath37 and the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 .",
    "that is , @xmath36 and @xmath38 are , respectively , in the units of mean free flight - time and mean free path of photon @xmath5 with respect to the resonant scattering without dust scattering and absorption . without resonant scattering , a signal propagates in the radial direction with the speed of light , the orbit of the signal is then @xmath40 . with dimensionless variable ,",
    "the size of the halo @xmath7 is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "the re - distribution function @xmath42 gives the probability of a photon absorbed at the frequency @xmath43 , and re - emitted at the frequency @xmath33 .",
    "it depends on the details of the scattering ( henyey & greestein 1941 ; hummer 1962 ; hummer 1969 ) .",

    ", the total number of photons is conserved in the evolution described by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "that is , the destruction processes of ly@xmath0 photons , such as the two - photon process ( spitzer & greenstein 1951 ; osterbrock 1962 ) , are ignored in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the recoil of atoms is also not considered in equation ( 4 ) or ( 5 ) .",
    "the effect of recoil actually is under control ( roy et al . 2009c , 2010 )",
    ". we will address it in next section .",
    "the absorption and scattering of dust are described by the term @xmath50 of eq.(3 ) , where @xmath51 , which is of the order of @xmath52 ( draine & lee 1984 ; draine 2003 ) .",
    "the term with @xmath53 of eq.(3 ) describes albedo , i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the cross section of dust scattering .",
    "generally , @xmath53 lies approximately between 0.3 and 0.4 ( pei 1992 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "since dust generally is much heavier than a single atoms , the recoil of dust particles can be neglected when colliding with a photon . under this `` heavy dust '' approximation",
    ", photons do not change their frequency during the collision with dust . the redistribution function of dust",
    "@xmath56 is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath43 , and is simply given by a phase function as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the legendre function .",

    "the cases of @xmath62 and -1 correspond to complete forward and backward scattering , respectively .",
    "generally , the factor @xmath60 is a function of the wavelength . for the ly@xmath0 photon",
    ", we will take @xmath63 for realistic dust scattering ( li & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the integral of eq.(6 ) is performed in appendix a.    in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the term with the parameter @xmath64 is due to the expansion of the universe . if @xmath65 is equal to the mean of the number density of cosmic hydrogen , we have @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the gunn - peterson optical depth . since the gunn - peterson optical depth is of the order of @xmath68 at high redshift ( e.g. roy et al .",
    "2009c ) , the parameter @xmath64 is of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , if the optical depth of halos is equal to or less than 10@xmath70 , the term with @xmath64 of eq.(3 ) can be ignored .    in eq.(3 )",
    "we neglect the effect of collision transition from @xmath71 state to @xmath72 state , which can significantly affect on the escape of ly@xmath0 photons when hi column density is higher than @xmath73 @xmath74 and dust absorption is very small ( neufeld , 1990 ) .",
    "this generally is out of the parameter range used below .",
    "we are also not considering the effects of bulk motion of the medium of halos ( e.g. spaans & silk 2006 , xu & wu , 2010 ) .",
    "eq.(6 ) indicates that the transfer equation ( 3 ) can be solved with the legendre expansion @xmath75 .",
    "if we take only the first two terms , @xmath76 and 1 , it is the eddington approximation as @xmath77 where @xmath78 they are , respectively , the angularly averaged specific intensity and flux . defining @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,",
    "eq.(3 ) yields the equations of @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 the mean intensity @xmath84 describes the @xmath33 photons trapped in the position @xmath38 at time @xmath36 by the resonant scattering , while the flux @xmath85 describes the photons in transit .",
    "the source term @xmath86 in the equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) can be described by a boundary condition of @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath87 .",
    "we can take @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the boundary condition is @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are , respectively , the intensity and normalized frequency profile of the sources . since equation ( 3 ) is linear , the solutions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 for given @xmath94 are equal to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the solutions of @xmath99 . on the other hand , the equation ( 3 ) is not linear with respect to the function @xmath91 .",
    "the solution @xmath93 for a given @xmath91 is not equal to @xmath100 , where @xmath98 is the solution of @xmath101 .    in the range outside the halo , @xmath102 , no photons propagate in the direction @xmath103",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath104 given by @xmath105 is then ( unno 1955 ) @xmath106 there is no photon in the field before @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the initial condition is @xmath108 we will solve equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) with boundary and initial conditions eqs.(11 ) - ( 13 ) by using the weno solver ( roy et al . 2009a , b , c , 2010 ) .",
    "some details of this method is given in appendix b.      we consider three models of the dust as follows :    i. pure scattering , @xmath109 : dust causes only anisotropic scattering , but no absorption ;    \\ii . scattering and absorption .",
    "@xmath110 : dust causes both absorption and anisotropic scattering .    \\iii .",
    "pure absorption .",
    "@xmath111 : dust causes only absorption , but no scattering ;    models i and iii do not occur in reality .",
    "they are , however , helpful to reveal the effects of pure scattering and absorption on the radiative transfer .",
    "since @xmath112 is on the order of @xmath113 , its effect will be significant only for halos with halos with optical depth @xmath114 , and ignorable for @xmath115 . to illustrate the dust effect , we use halos of @xmath116 , and take larger @xmath117 to be @xmath118 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath117 is frequency - independent .",
    "we consider below only the case of grey dust , i.e. @xmath117 is independent of frequency @xmath33 .",
    "this certainly is not realistic dust .",
    "yet , the frequency range given in solution below mostly are in the range @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , the approximation of grey dust would be proper if cross section of dust is not significantly frequency dependent in the range @xmath119 .      as the first example of numerical solutions ,",
    "we show the wouthuysen - field ( w - f ) effect , which requires that the distribution of ly@xmath0 photons in the frequency space should be thermalized near the resonant frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the w - f effect illustrates the difference between the analytical solutions of the fokker - planck approximation and that of eqs .",

    "the intensity of @xmath81 is decreasing from left to right in figure 1 , because the absorption is increasing with the models from i to iii .",
    "a remarkable feature shown in figure 1 is that all @xmath84 have a flat plateau in the range @xmath130 .",
    "this gives the frequency range of the w - f local thermalization ( roy et al , 2009b , c ) .",
    "the range of the flat plateau @xmath130 is almost dust - independent , either for model i or for models ii and iii .",
    "this is expected , as neither the absorption nor scattering given by the @xmath117 term of eq.(3 ) changes the frequency distribution of photons .",
    "the redistribution function ( 6 ) also does not change the frequency distribution of photons .",
    "this point can also be seen from eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) , in which the @xmath117 terms are frequency - independent .",
    "the evolution of the frequency distribution of photons is due only to the resonant scattering .",
    "since thermalization will erase all frequency features within the range @xmath130 , the double - peaked structure does not retain information of the photon frequency distribution within @xmath131 at the source .",

    "first , the random walk picture in the physical space will no longer be available for estimating the effective optical depth of dust absorption . for a medium with the optical depth of absorption and resonant scattering to be @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 , the effective absorption optical depth is found to be almost independent of @xmath161 , and to be equal to about a few times of @xmath215 .",
    "second , dust absorption will , of course , yield the decrease of the flux of ly@xmath0 photons emergent from optical thick medium .",
    "however , if the absorption cross - section of dust is frequency independent , the double - peaked structure of the frequency profile is basically dust - independent .",
    "the double - peaked structure does not get narrowed or widened by the absorption and scattering of dust .",
    "third , the time scales of ly@xmath0 photon transfer basically are independent of dust scattering and absorption .",
    "it is because those time scales are mainly determined by the kinetics in the frequency space , while dust does not affect the behavior of the transfer in the frequency space if the cross section of the dust is wavelength - independent .",
    "the local thermal equilibrium makes the anisotropic scattering to be ineffective on the angular distribution of photons . dust absorption and scattering",
    "do not lead to the increase or decrease of the time of storing ly@xmath0 photons in the halos .",
    "the differences between the time - independent solutions of the fokker - planck approximation , or monte carlo simulation and the weno solution of eq.(3 ) is mainly related to the w - f effect .",
    "therefore , all above - mentioned features can already be clearly seen with halos of @xmath216 , in which the w - f local thermal equilibrium has been well established .    in this context , most calculation in this paper is on holes with @xmath217 .",
    "this range of @xmath41 certainly is unable to describe halos with column number density of hi larger than 10@xmath218 @xmath74 ( e.g. roy et al .",
    "nevertheless , the result of @xmath217 would already be useful for studying the 21 cm region around high - redshift sources , of which the optical depth typically is ( liu et al 2007 ; roy , et al .",

    "for these objects the relation between dimensionless @xmath36 and physical time @xmath31 is given by @xmath222 the 21 cm emission rely on the w - f effect .",
    "on the other hand , the time - scale of the evolution of the 21 region is short .",
