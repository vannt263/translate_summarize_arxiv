    "several astrophysical and cosmological problems are involved with neutrino physics , e.g. leptogenesis induced baryogenesis , neutrino cooled accretion disks , @xmath0process nucleosynthesis in supernova explosions etc . a successful description of most of these scenario must consider neutrinos in curved spacetime . naturally , in order to solve such problems",
    ", one should begin with dirac equation in curved spacetime . indeed in late eighties it was first pointed out @xcite that the presence of gravitational field affects neutrino flavors which violates equivalence principle .",
    "interestingly , the neutrino spin coupled with background spin connection in curved spacetime gives rise to an interaction which , depending on the nature of spacetime , violates lorentz and then cpt symmetry@xcite , atleast in a local coordinate .",
    "as @xmath18 and @xmath19 are different , there is a possibility of neutrino@xmath20antineutrino asymmetry with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the relativistic degrees of freedom and @xmath23 the temperature of the universe . in early universe with gravy wave perturbation@xcite at @xmath24gev , @xmath25 , what we observe today . during this phase",
    "the flavor oscillation is supposed to take place vigorously , controlled by gravity completely .      at the age of universe @xmath26sec , if @xmath27ev @xmath28 , then the flavor oscillation probability @xmath29 . for tev",
    "neutrinos gravity effect increases probability two orders of magnitude compared to that in flat space , while for thermal neutrinos the effect is @xmath30 times .      in this case",
    "@xmath31 was already computed@xcite as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole . for neutrinos at around @xmath35 schwarzschild",
    "radii away of the black hole of mass @xmath36 , @xmath27ev and oscillation length decreases to an order of magnitude compared to that in flat space .",
    "in nonrelativistic limit , gravitational interaction becomes @xmath38 , where @xmath39 be the spin of the fermion . according to the eot - wash ii experiment@xcite , where a macroscopic number of fermions could be polarized in the same direction ,",
    "the difference in energy between fermion spins polarized parallel and anti - parallel to @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , by measuring @xmath42 experimentally , a bound on @xmath40 can be imposed .    in a parametric material",
    "we can measure the net magnetization using a squid@xcite , when external field @xmath41 appears as an effective magnetic field @xmath43 . in the experiment ,",
    "@xmath44 can be probed to be @xmath45 g , which implies @xmath46gev .    about @xmath47 schwarzschild away from a black hole of mass @xmath48 , @xmath49  gev which could affect the flavor oscillation length , as obtained in flat space , if @xmath50 , because the mass of a neutrino is @xmath51gev . however",
    ", a neutrino@xmath20antineutrino oscillation length would be @xmath52 km in the vicinity of a black hole , when @xmath31 is very small ( @xmath53gev for a @xmath54 black hole ) which is quite compatible with the experimental bound described above .",
    "for neutrinos in a satellite orbiting earth with an azimuthal velocity @xmath55 km / sec , @xmath56gev , is further smaller , which is very hard to detect .",
    "a neutrino coupling to spacetime curvature violates lorentz and then cpt symmetry with a suitable gravitational background . the conditions : ( 1 ) spacetime must not be spherical symmetric , ( 2 ) background curvature coupling is either a constant or an even function of spacetime .",
    "this results in a possible neutrino@xmath20antineutrino asymmetry and then leptogenesis induced baryogenesis based on sphaleron process .",
    "this also leads to the neutrino@xmath20antineutrino oscillation .",
    "early curved universe is a very feasible situation to have this lorentz symmetry violation occurred .",
    "gravitational field modifies the mass and then the mass matrix of neutrinos which allows the particle and anti@xmath20particle to mix .",
    "this generates neutrino mass varying with time .",
    "once gravity modifies the mass of neutrinos , it might affect flavor oscillation probability and corresponding oscillation length , depending on the nature of gravity .",
