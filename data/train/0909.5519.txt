    "<S> we propose a method to prepare different non - poissonian signal pulses from sources of poissonian photon number distribution using only linear optical elements and threshold photon detectors . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows a simple passive preparation of decoy states for quantum key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resulting key rates are comparable to the performance of active choices of intensities of poissonian signals .    </S>",
    "<S> the main benchmark to compare different quantum key distribution ( qkd ) systems is their secret key rate over a given distance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is well known that qkd schemes with single photon sources can provide a key generation rate of linear behavior with the transmission efficiency of the quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , single photon sources are still beyond our present experimental capability and qkd implementations with phase randomized weak coherent pulses ( wcp ) are typically employed . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it has been recently shown that decoy state qkd with wcp can basically reach the same performance as single photon sources @xcite . the essential idea behind decoy state qkd </S>",
    "<S> is quite simple . </S>",
    "<S> the sender ( alice ) varies , independently and randomly , the mean photon number of each signal state she transmits to the receiver ( bob ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually performed by using a variable optical attenuator together with a random number generator . from the measurement results corresponding to different intensity settings , </S>",
    "<S> the legitimate users can obtain a better estimation of the behavior of the quantum channel , which translates into an enhancement of the achievable secret key rate and distance . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been successfully implemented in several recent experiments @xcite , which show the practical feasibility of this method .    </S>",
    "<S> while active modulation of the intensity of the pulses suffices to perform decoy state qkd in principle , in practice passive preparation might be desirable in some scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in those setups operating at high transmission rates . known passive methods rely on the use of a parametric down - conversion source together with a photon detector @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that phase randomized wcp can also be used for the same purpose , _ i.e. _ , one does not need a non - linear optics network preparing entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> note that the crucial requirement of a passive decoy state setup is to have correlations between the photon number statistics of different signals ; hence it is sufficient that these correlations are classical . </S>",
    "<S> our method uses only linear optical elements and a threshold photon detector . for simplicity , we consider that this detector has perfect detection efficiency and no dark counts . </S>",
    "<S> but this analysis can also be adapted to cover the case of imperfect detectors . a similar technique </S>",
    "<S> can also be applied to heralded single - photon sources showing non - poissonian photon number statistics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the key idea is rather simple , although it is counter - intuitive . </S>",
    "<S> it is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when two phase randomized wcp , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interfere at a beam splitter ( bs ) of transmittance @xmath2 , the photon number statistics of the two outcome signals are classically correlated . to see this , </S>",

    "<S> the output signals are given by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the joint probability @xmath6 of having @xmath7 photons in mode @xmath8 and @xmath9 photons in mode @xmath10 is the product of two poissonian distributions : @xmath11^m / m!$ ] , with @xmath12 , @xmath13/\\upsilon$ ] , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of two phase randomized wcp can be solved by just integrating @xmath6 over all angles @xmath16 , _ </S>",

    "<S> [ figure1 ] ]    by measuring one outcome signal , the conditional photon number statistics of the remaining signal varies depending on the result obtained . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , whenever one ignores the result of the measurement the total probability of finding @xmath7 photons in mode @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath19 which turns out to be a non - poissonian probability distribution . the joint probability for seeing @xmath7 photons in mode </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 and no click in the threshold detector has the form @xmath20 if the detector produces a click , the joint probability of finding @xmath7 photons in mode @xmath8 is given by @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> [ figure2 ] ( case a ) shows the conditional photon number statistics of the outcome signal in mode @xmath8 depending on the result of the detector ( click and not click ) : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24}i_{0,\\xi}$ ] , and where @xmath25 represents the modified bessel function of the first kind @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this figure includes as well a comparison between @xmath26 and a poissonian distribution of the same mean photon number ( case b ) . both distributions , @xmath27 and @xmath26 , are also non - poissonian .     </S>",

    "<S> [ figure2 ] ]    to perform decoy state qkd , we consider that alice and bob treat no click and click events separately , and they distill secret key from both of them . </S>",

    "<S> this method requires that @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfy certain conditions that we checked numerically . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that many other estimation techniques are also available , like , for instance , linear programming tools . </S>",

    "<S> this model reproduces a normal behaviour of the quantum channel , _ </S>",

    "<S> our results , however , can also be applied to any other quantum channel , as they only depend on the observed gains and qbers . in the scenario </S>",

    "<S> [ figure3 ] includes as well the case of an active asymptotic decoy state qkd system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cutoff points where the secret key rate drops down to zero are @xmath101 km ( passive setup with two intensity settings ) and @xmath102 km ( active asymptotic setup ) . </S>",
    "<S> one could reduce this gap further by using a passive scheme with more intensity settings . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , one may employ a photon number resolving detector instead of a simple threshold photon detector , or use more threshold detectors in combination with bs . from these results </S>",
    "<S> we see that the performance of the passive scheme is comparable to the active one , thus showing the practical interest of the passive setup .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed a simple passive decoy state qkd system with phase randomized wcp . </S>",
    "<S> this setup represents an alternative to those active schemes based on the use of a variable optical attenuator . in the asymptotic limit of an infinite long experiment , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that this passive system can provide a similar performance to the one achieved with an active source and infinity decoy settings . </S>",
    "<S> this idea can also be applied to other practical scenarios with different signals and detectors like , for example , those based on thermal states or even strong coherent pulses in conjunction with a regular photo - detector . </S>",
