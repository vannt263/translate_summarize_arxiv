    "photometric redshifts were obtained with the bpz ( bayesian photometric redshifts ) software ( benitez 2000 ) , combining our acs photometry with v and @xmath113band photometry from public subaru / suprime - cam images of this field .",
    "galaxies with photometric redshift between 0.8 and 1.5 ( consistent with an error of @xmath0  0.3  mag in photometric redshifts around z=1.2 ) were selected ( 169 galaxies ; 80% of the galaxies within 3@xmath101 from the total elliptical cmr ) .",

    "the completeness has been estimated by simulating 5,000 galaxies on our acs image and detecting them with the same technique described in section  3 . in the detection we required a match within 3 pixels in the spatial coordinates , and within 0.5  mag in magnitude .",

    "the sample has a limiting magnitude of @xmath114  mag ( equivalent to absolute rest frame magnitudes @xmath115  mag and @xmath116  mag from bc03 models ) , corresponding to a completeness in detection of 80% .",
    "our sample probes the dwarf galaxies regime ( @xmath111 fainter than -20.2  mag from tanaka et al .",
    "2005 ) too much close to our magnitude limit of @xmath114  mag to be able to draw firm conclusions about a truncation of the red sequence .",

    "since we are already considering old galaxy populations , the lynx cluster galaxies should have on average twice solar metallicities , or should all be reddened by dust , in order to explain these redder colors in terms of passive evolution models    however , an offset in the @xmath47 color might also be explained by an uncertainty of a few hundreds of a magnitude arising from the uncertainty in the shape of the acs @xmath2 bandpass response ( see discussion in sirianni et al .",
    "the acs bandpass responses have been calibrated from the observed versus the predicted acs count rates , up to 9000 .",
    "this calibration permits us to estimate acs bandpass zero points with an uncertainty of 0.01  mag .",
    "the local 4000  break observed in galaxy templates with age 4  gyr and solar metallicity is redshifted around 9000  at z=1.26 .",
    "this means that most of the galaxy light at z=1.26 lies at wavelengths larger than 9000 , where the acs @xmath2 bandpass calibration is more uncertain .",
