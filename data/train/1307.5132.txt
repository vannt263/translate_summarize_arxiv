    "the choice of toeplitz factors is natural for two reasons .",
    "firstly , toeplitz matrices are ubiquitous and one of the most well - studied and understood classes of structured matrices .",
    "they arise in pure mathematics : algebra @xcite , algebraic geometry @xcite , analysis @xcite , combinatorics @xcite , differential geometry @xcite , graph theory @xcite , integral equations @xcite , operator algebra @xcite , partial differential equations @xcite , probability @xcite , representation theory @xcite , topology @xcite ; as well as in applied mathematics : approximation theory @xcite , compressive sensing @xcite , numerical integral equations @xcite , numerical integration @xcite , numerical partial differential equations @xcite , image processing @xcite , optimal control @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , queueing networks @xcite , signal processing @xcite , statistics @xcite , time series analysis @xcite , among other areas .",
    "furthermore , studies of related objects such as toeplitz determinants @xcite , toeplitz kernels @xcite , @xmath21-deformed toeplitz matrices @xcite , and toeplitz operators @xcite , have led to much recent success and were behind some major developments in mathematics ( e.g.  borodin  okounkov formula for toeplitz determinant @xcite ) and in physics ( e.g.  toeplitz quantization @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , toeplitz matrices have some of the most attractive computational properties and are amenable to a wide range of disparate algorithms .",
    "multiplication , inversion , determinant computation , lu and qr decompositions of @xmath9 toeplitz matrices may all be computed in @xmath22 time and in numerically stable ways .",
    "contrast this with the usual @xmath23 complexity for arbitrary matrices . in an astounding article @xcite ,",
    "bitmead and anderson first showed that toeplitz systems may in fact be solved in @xmath24 via the use of displacement rank ; later advances have achieved essentially the same complexity ( possibly @xmath25 ) but are practically more efficient .",
    "these algorithms are based on a variety of different techniques : bareiss algorithm @xcite , generalized schur algorithm @xcite , fft and hadamard product @xcite , schur complement @xcite , semiseparable matrices @xcite , divide - and - concur technique @xcite  the last three have the added advantage of mathematically proven numerical stability .",
    "one can also find algorithms based on more unusual techniques , e.g. , number theoretic transforms @xcite or syzygy reduction @xcite .    in parallel to these direct methods",
    ", we should also mention the equally substantial body of work in iterative methods for toeplitz matrices ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these are based in part on an elegant theory of optimal circulant preconditioners @xcite , which are the most complete and well - understood class of preconditioners in iterative matrix computations . in short , there is a rich plethora of highly efficient algorithms for toeplitz matrices and the toeplitz decomposition in would often ( but not always ) allow one to take advantage of these algorithms for general matrices . to a large extent , what we said in this section about toeplitz matrices also holds true for hankel matrices .",
    "the classical matrix decompositions lu , qr , and svd correspond to the bruhat , iwasawa , and cartan decompositions of lie groups @xcite . in this sense , lu , qr",
    ", svd already exhaust the standard decompositions of lie groups and to go beyond these , we will have to look beyond lie theory .",
    "the toeplitz and hankel decompositions described in this article represent a new class of matrix decompositions that do not arise rom lie theoretic considerations but from algebraic geometric ones .    as such",
    ", the results in this article will rely on some very basic algebraic geometry .",
    "since we are writing for an applied and computational mathematics readership , we will not assume any familiarity with algebraic geometry and will introduce some basic terminologies in this section .",
    "readers interested in the details may refer to @xcite for further information .",

    "<S> we show that every @xmath0 matrix is generically a product of @xmath1 toeplitz matrices and always a product of at most @xmath2 toeplitz matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the same result holds true if the word ` toeplitz ' is replaced by ` hankel ' , and the generic bound @xmath1 is sharp . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that these decompositions into toeplitz or hankel factors are unusual : we may not in general replace the subspace of toeplitz or hankel matrices by an arbitrary @xmath3-dimensional subspace of @xmath4 matrices . furthermore such decompositions do not exist if we require the factors to be symmetric toeplitz , persymmetric hankel , or circulant matrices , even if we allow an infinite number of factors . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we discuss how the toeplitz and hankel decompositions of a generic matrix may be computed by either ( i ) solving a system of linear and quadratic equations if the number of factors is required to be @xmath5 , or ( ii ) gaussian elimination in @xmath6 time if the number of factors is allowed to be @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the top ten algorithms of the 20th century @xcite is the ` decompositional approach to matrix computation ' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a matrix may be expressed as a product of a lower - triangular with an upper - triangular matrix ( lu ) , or of an orthogonal with an upper - triangular matrix ( qr ) , or of two orthogonal matrices with a diagonal one ( svd ) , is a cornerstone of modern numerical computations . </S>",
    "<S> as aptly described in @xcite , such matrix decompositions provide a platform on which a variety of scientific and engineering problems can be solved . </S>",
    "<S> once computed , they may be reused repeatedly to solve new problems involving the original matrix , and may often be updated or downdated with respect to small changes in the original matrix . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they permit reasonably simple rounding - error analysis and afford high - quality software implementations .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a new class of matrix decompositions that differs from the classical ones mentioned above but are similar in spirit . </S>",
    "<S> recall that a toeplitz matrix is one whose entries are constant along the diagonals and a hankel matrix is one whose entries are constant along the reverse diagonals : @xmath8 given any @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 over @xmath11 , we will show that @xmath12 where @xmath13 are all toeplitz matrices and @xmath14 where @xmath15 are all hankel matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we shall call a _ toeplitz decomposition _ and a _ hankel decomposition _ of @xmath10 accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath16 is @xmath17 for almost all @xmath9 matrices ( in fact holds generically ) and is at most @xmath18 for all @xmath9 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the generic bound @xmath19 is sharp . </S>",
    "<S> so every matrix can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a product of @xmath19 toeplitz matrices and one can not do better than @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the perpetual value of matrix decompositions alluded to in the first paragraph deserves some elaboration . </S>",
    "<S> a toeplitz or a hankel decomposition of a given matrix @xmath10 may not be as easy to compute as lu or qr ; but once computed , these decompositions can be reused ad infinitum for any problem involving @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 has a known toeplitz decomposition with @xmath16 factors , one can solve linear systems in @xmath10 within @xmath20 time via any of the superfast algorithms in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of specialized algorithms tied to a specific matrix should not be underestimated ; for example , two other algorithms that made the top ten list , fast fourier transform @xcite and fast multipole method @xcite , may be viewed as algorithms designed specially for the fourier transform matrix and the helmholtz matrix respectively . </S>"
