    "long - range magnetic order can coexist with superfluidity , making possible , e.g. , ferro - superfluids  @xcite .",
    "the interaction can then lead to novel instabilities , e.g. , toward formation of droplet crystals  @xcite , and formation of a condensate may be strongly influenced by the spin dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the interaction can also profoundly affect the stability and structure of vortices  @xcite , e.g. , inducing a phase transition from straight to twisted vortex lines  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the structure of topological defects and textures is a central topic in the study of spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , where the atomic spin degree of freedom is not frozen out by strong magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a rich phenomenology of the internal structure of vortices  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , marks an increasing experimental interest in the internal core structure .",
    "the spin degree of freedom in spinor becs also implies that dipolar interactions ( dis ) arising from the magnetic dipole moment of the atoms can have a strong impact on the spin texture  @xcite .",
    "nontrivial textures arising spontaneously due to di have been observed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , the potentially large impact on the internal structure of vortices has so far been little studied .",

    "the multicomponent condensate wave function of a spinor bec allows the condensate to maintain the superfluid density in the core of singular vortices .",
    "in addition to depleting the condensate density , the wave function can also be excited out of the ground - state manifold to accommodate the order - parameter singularity and form a filled defect core . here",
    "we numerically find the superfluid cores of singular vortices when the atoms exhibit a long - range and anisotropic magnetic di .",
    "the di gives rise to a new spin - dependent healing length , adding to the hierarchy of characteristic length scales arising form the contact interaction to determine the structure of singular - vortex cores  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the interplay of these length scales and demonstrate how the size of a singular - vortex core is determined by the shorter of the spin - dependent healing lengths when the di and contact interaction both restrict breaking of the ground - state spin condition ( the ground - state phase of the bulk superfluid ) , e.g. , in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin-1 bec . on the other hand , when the contact interaction and di compete , such as in the spin-1 polar phase , we explain how a singular - vortex core expands with increasing di , beyond the size in its absence . in addition , the anisotropy of the interaction leads to an internal spin texture that is potentially observable in a spin-3 @xmath0cr condensate .",
    "we further analyze manifestations of the interaction anisotropy in the spin-1 model system and and show it leads to a ground - state spin vortex that appears perpendicularly to the axis of a slow rotation .",
    "the structure is then the result of interplay between dipolar spin alignment and rotation as the vortex line bends to adapt to the latter . at more rapid rotation ,",
    "we demonstrate a nontrivial interaction dependence of the angular momentum carried by a ground - state coreless vortex .",
    "we show how it may be understood from a competition between dipolar spin alignment and the adaptation of the spin texture to rotation .",
    "drastically different spin - ordering effects can appear in the presence of a sufficiently strong external magnetic field , such that the di may be averaged over the rapid spin precession  @xcite .",

    "the stabilization of a vortex line usually requires a sufficiently rapid external rotation .",
    "while the ground state in a rotating fm spin-1 condensate is generally predicted to be made up of coreless vortices  @xcite , a singular fm vortex can also be energetically ( meta-)stable for a range of trap - rotation frequencies  @xcite , and is predicted to form the ground state when the coreless vortex is destabilized by conservation of a weak magnetization  @xcite . even though spin vortices that carry no mass circulation can form in a spinor bec , one would not generally expect them to be energetically stable . in a fm spin-1 bec , a spin vortex can be stabilized by magnetic fields , e.g. , in a ioffe - pritchard trap  @xcite , and a bec with fm interactions initially in a polar state can be dynamically unstable towards spin - vortex formation  @xcite . in the fm phase ,",

    ", a vortex - line singularity can also be accommodated by exciting the wave function out of its ground - state manifold . in a spin-1 bec , the resulting filled vortex core becomes energetically favorable when @xmath28 is small compared with @xmath102 , which is usually the case .",

    "coreless vortices are also predicted to make up the ground state in a rotating nondipolar fm condensate  @xcite , unless destabilized through conservation of a sufficiently weak magnetization  @xcite .",
    "the coreless vortex is characterized by a nonsingular spin texture in which the superfluid circulation varies continuously as the spin bends from @xmath121 on the vortex line toward its asymptotic direction .",
    "the boundary condition on the spin texture away from the vortex line is however not fixed , allowing it to adapt to the imposed rotation , bending more sharply towards the @xmath122 direction as rotation increases .",

    "far from the vortex line , the di thus determines the spin texture by the same mechanism as for the spin vortex .",
    "note , however , that while the two vortices appear superficially similar , both exhibiting tangential disgyrations of the spin vector at large length scales , their topology is distinctly different .",
    "this is easily established from the complex phases of the individual spinor components , which exhibit @xmath123 winding in the singular spin vortex , but wind by @xmath124 in the coreless vortex . in the latter case",
    ", the vortex can be removed through purely local spin rotations , provided that the value of the spin is free to rotate at the edge of the cloud .",
    "the structure of the coreless vortex can be understood as the result of competition between rotation and di . while the spin texture strives to adapt to the imposed rotation asymptotically forming an angle with the @xmath69 axis that depends on the rotation frequency , the di strives to align the asymptotic texture in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "this competition is reflected in the total angular momentum @xmath125 carried by the vortex , which becomes dependent on @xmath29 at fixed trap rotation .",
    "when the trap rotates slowly , the rotation alone is not enough to bring the asymptotic texture into the @xmath101 plane . increasing @xmath29",

    "<S> we demonstrate how dipolar interactions can have pronounced effects on the structure of vortices in atomic spinor bose - einstein condensates and illustrate generic physical principles that apply across dipolar spinor systems . </S>",
    "<S> we then find and analyze the cores of singular vortices with non - abelian charges in the point - group symmetry of a spin-3 @xmath0cr condensate . </S>",
    "<S> using a simpler model system , we analyze the underlying dipolar physics and show how a characteristic length scale arising from the magnetic dipolar coupling interacts with the hierarchy of healing lengths of the @xmath1-wave scattering , and leads to simple criteria for the core structure : when the interactions both energetically favor the ground - state spin condition , such as in the spin-1 ferromagnetic phase , the size of singular vortices is restricted to the shorter spin - dependent healing length . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when the interactions compete ( e.g. , in the spin-1 polar phase ) , we find that the core of a singular vortex is enlarged by increasing dipolar coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate how the spin - alignment arising from the interaction anisotropy is manifest in the appearance of a ground - state spin - vortex line that is oriented perpendicularly to the condensate axis of rotation , as well as in potentially observable internal core spin textures . </S>",
    "<S> we also explain how it leads to interaction - dependent angular momentum in nonsingular vortices as a result of competition with rotation - induced spin ordering . </S>",
    "<S> when the anisotropy is modified by a strong magnetic field , we show how it gives rise to a symmetry - breaking deformation of a vortex core into a spin - domain wall . </S>"
