    "alternatively one can look at an appropriately defined order parameter .",

    "could not be determined accurately from the gap .",
    "the charge gap @xmath65 has a minimum for all @xmath61 and the location of the minimum scales in the thermodynamic limit to @xmath163 , however , the gap remains finite at this transition point .",
    "the same behavior has been found for the one - particle gap @xmath78 in ref .",
    "the ionicity ( not shown ) is no longer a good indicator of the neutral - ionic transition , it is found to be a continuous function of @xmath146 . instead of that the dimer order has to be studied , as has been done in the ionic hubbard model .",
    "the behavior is again very similar .",
    "the extrapolated value of the measured dimer order parameter is exceedingly small , of the order of @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "it becomes finite above this transition point , but disappears again at a larger value of @xmath146 .",
    "calculations on very long chains ( @xmath98 ) still do not allow a reliable extrapolation to determine the coupling where this happens .    since it is difficult to locate the second transition from the vanishing of the spin gap or the dimerization , we have studied the behavior of the entropy .",
    "our results obtained on finite chains are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_05_entr ] .    .",
    "]    the single - site entropy seems to develop a cusp indicating a second - order phase transition taking place at @xmath166 , but only one transition is found .",
    "in contrast to this the two - site entropy possesses two maxima for all finite chain lengths and they both develop into a cusp - like peak in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the critical points are at @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "calculations in the vicinity of @xmath169 on chains up to @xmath98 lattice sites confirm that although the rise in the two - site entropy is rather steep , there is no jump in it , the transition is of second order .",
    "similar results , two transitions have been found for other values of @xmath139 as a function of @xmath146 , when @xmath139 is larger than about @xmath170 .",
    "when @xmath139 is larger than the critical @xmath136 or @xmath137 , one or both transitions appear for negative @xmath146 values .      the results obtained until now can be summarized in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .     and @xmath146 .",
    "dashed line indicates first - order transition , solid lines correspond to second - order or bkt transitions .",
    "the star denotes the tricritical point .",
    "the phase boundaries of the full ionic hubbard model are also shown . ]",
    "the two transitions obtained in the ionic hubbard model and the first - order transition of the donor - acceptor model appear in fact as two limiting cases of the unified model .",
    "when @xmath64 is negative and @xmath171 , the neutral - ionic transition is discontinuous , the ionicity jumps by a finite amount .",
    "a tricritical point appears at about @xmath172 and @xmath173 , beyond which two transitions are found .",
    "the charge - transfer gap vanishes at one of the transitions , while the spin gap does so at the other one .",
    "since the dimer order parameter is nonvanishing in the narrow region only , between the two continuous transitions , three phases can be identified , a regular neutral , a regular ionic , and a dimerized phase inbetween .",
    "in summary , we have studied the neutral - ionic transition in organic mixed - stack compounds using the density - matrix renormalization - group method .",
    "first , we have shown that a unified model can be derived which is identical to the donor - acceptor model when the intramolecular coulomb repulsion is the largest energy in the problem and it represents a good approximation to the ionic hubbard model when @xmath174 .",
    "detailed numerical calculations have been performed on this unified model calculating excitation gaps , ionicity , lattice site entropy and dimer order parameter on long chains .",
    "we have shown that the best quantity to study is the two - site entropy .",
    "it exhibits the transitions most clearly , even at points where finite - size effects are important and the vanishing of gaps in the thermodynamic limit is difficult to establish . in this way",
    "we could determine the unified phase diagram as a function of intersite coulomb interaction and the intraatomic energies .",
    "the results are in complete agreement with earlier results on the ionic hubbard model , while earlier works on the donor - acceptor model have found a single ( first or second order ) transition only .",
    "this is probably due to the closeness of the two transitions , which could not be resolved on short chains .    in",
    "the model studied , spontaneous dimerization appears in a narrow range of couplings only , while experiments indicate that the ionic phase is dimerized when electron - phonon coupling is taken into account and the displacement of ions is permitted .",
    "extension of the calculations in this direction is in progress .",
