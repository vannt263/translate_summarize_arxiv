    "the gamma - ray binary 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 was discovered with _ fermi _ in 2011 .",
    "@xcite found modulation in the radio to gamma - ray bands with a period of @xmath3days , identifying the source as a gamma - ray binary .",
    "they further identified the companion star to be an o6v((f ) ) star .",
    "soon after the discovery , subsequent broadband studies were carried out @xcite in order to better characterize the source properties , but in no case were they able to identify the nature of the compact object .",
    "x - ray properties of the gamma - ray binary 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 were measured in detail with _",
    "swift_. @xcite showed that the x - ray flux peak seen at phase 0 ( gamma - ray maximum ) by @xcite seems not to be a persistent feature and instead shows a relatively large orbit - to - orbit variation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found evidence of a correlation between flux and spectral hardness in the x - ray band .",
    "recently , @xcite refined the gamma - ray period using _ fermi _ observations with a longer baseline , and found the period to be @xmath4days .",
    "since this is slightly different from the value ( @xmath5days ) used for the previous x - ray study carried out by @xcite , the x - ray results need to be refined using the new gamma - ray period .",
    "the baseline of the x - ray observations is long ( 5 years ) , and thus phases of later observations may change significantly .",
    "important questions to be addressed for gamma - ray binaries are : what is the nature of the compact object ( known only for psr  b1259@xmath063 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and what is the physical emission mechanism .",
    "if the source is powered by accretion , a complex continuum spectrum is expected whether the compact object is a neutron star or a black hole .",

    "@xcite four times between 2014 june 4 and december 1 with exposures of @xmath220ks for each observation .",
    "the total exposure was 90 ks .",

    "swift _ observations and two archival _ xmm - newton _ observations ( see table  [ ta : ta1 ] ) .",
    "the total exposure of the 71 _ swift _ observations was 169ks , and each exposure was relatively short .",
    "the _ nustar _ observations were processed with the standard pipeline tools nupipeline and nuproducts of nustardas 1.4.1 integrated in heasoft 6.16 .",
    "we used _ nustar _",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were processed with epproc and emproc in science analysis system ( sas ) 14.0.0 using standard filters .",
    "detection of pulsations in gamma - ray binaries can be difficult for several reasons , such as the possibilities of an unfavorable emission geometry , absorption of soft x - rays by the wind , or a large background due to non - thermal unpulsed emission . even in a favorable situation where the above effects are minimal , the doppler effect due to binary motion can blur the pulse signal if the orbit is tight . for 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 , @xcite showed that the doppler broadening is not a concern for a 20-ks observation assuming a circular orbit with an inclination of 30@xmath10 .",
    "we therefore attempt to search for the pulsation .",
    "event arrival times measured at the spacecraft were transformed into those at the solar system barycenter with barycorr for the _ nustar _ and barycen for the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "we did not search the _ swift _ data because of the paucity of counts in individual _ swift _ observations .",
    "for the _ nustar _ data , we produced an event list for each observation in the 320kev band using a circular aperture with @xmath11 .",
    "we performed the timing analysis with the data from each _ nustar _ focal plane module as well as with the combined dataset . above 20kev",
    "background dominates , and hence we adopt that as the high end of our band . note that the results below do not depend strongly on the exact energy range or the aperture size",
    "we folded the event time series to test periods between @xmath12 s , and calculated @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath13 is fairly large for some test periods .",
    "however , we find that the large @xmath13 seen in one observation is not reproduced in the others .",
    "we further verified that the large @xmath13 values are not significant .",
    "note that the measured @xmath13 distribution does not follow a @xmath14 distribution , but has a long tail , and thus we used a functional distribution obtained by fitting the measured @xmath13 distribution in order to estimate the significance .",
    "we performed the same study for the _ xmm - newton_/pn data in the 0.52kev and 0.510kev bands , and did not find any significant pulsations . assuming the pulse profile is a sine function with a period in the range of 0.11s",
    ", we estimate the 90% upper limit for the pulse fractions to be 47% and 6% in the 320 kev and 0.510 kev bands , respectively .",
    "next , we refine the x - ray measurement of the orbital period by using a longer baseline using the _ swift _ data over a longer time period than the previous work . note that we did not use the data taken with _",
    "xmm - newton _ or _ nustar _ because their count rate measurements can not be directly compared to those of _",
    "swift_. as was done by @xcite , we use epoch folding @xcite because of the unequal exposures of the observations . in the _ swift",
    "_ observations , we extracted source and background events in the 0.510kev band within a @xmath15 radius circle , and an annular region with inner radius 50@xmath16 and outer radius 100@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we then folded the event time series at test periods around @xmath17days @xcite , producing a light curve with 16 bins .",
    "we used the same epoch for phase 0 as that used in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath14 of the light curve for each trial period , and followed the fitting technique as described in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that we modeled the underlying continuum using a power - law function instead of the constant model employed by @xcite , because the @xmath14 of the folded light curve is rising towards short periods ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit continuum model is @xmath18 ; the exact value of the power - law index varies between 0.9 and 1.1 depending on the fit range .",
    "we find that the best - fit orbital period varies between 16.538 and 16.55 days , depending on the number of bins , and the search step or search range .",
    "we varied the number of bins between 8 and 18 to ensure that the light curve is resolved and the @xmath14 statistic is applicable , and the search step between 0.001 and 0.005 days , smaller than the uncertainty in the @xmath19 measurement ( @xmath20days ) .",
    "the search range was varied between @xmath21day and @xmath22 days .",
    "we find that the variations are within 1@xmath23 of the measurements .",
    "the resulting period is @xmath24 days .",
    "we show the folded light curve in figure  [ fig : fig2]a .        [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we also used the second harmonic to measure the orbital period , since it can be measured with better precision , and found that the measurement is more stable , varying only @xmath25days as a function of the number of bins , search step or the search range .",
    "the result is @xmath26 days .",
    "our result is consistent with the _ fermi _ measured value ( @xmath27 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a null hypothesis probability @xmath28 .",
    "cc & +    although @xmath9 towards the source has been measured previously , the uncertainty was relatively large .",
    "since there is one more _ xmm - newton _ observation ( obs .",
    "i d 0694390101 , table  [ ta : ta1 ] ) taken after the previous x - ray study @xcite , we can determine @xmath9 more precisely using the _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from a circle with @xmath29 ( obs . i d 0604700101 ) or @xmath30 ( obs .",
    "i d 0694390101 ) , and background spectra from a circle with @xmath31 in a source - free region @xmath2200@xmath16 vertically upwards along the detector column from the source . note that we used different source extraction regions because of differences in exposure times .",
    "since it has been suggested that the spectral hardness varies orbitally , we used different spectral slopes for observations taken at different phases ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] )",
    ". thus , we fit the two _ xmm - newton _ spectra separately allowing all the fit parameters to vary .",
    "we grouped the spectra to have 20 counts per bin , and fit them with an absorbed power - law model with the angr abundance in xspec @xcite using @xmath14 statistics or _",
    "l _ statistics @xcite .",
    "the two methods yield consistent results .",
    "the best - fit @xmath9 values for the observations are statistically consistent with each other ( table  [ ta : ta1 ] ) .",
    "best - fit @xmath9 values obtained with a different abundance model ( wilm in xspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the two spectra are still consistent with each other .",
    "therefore , we use a common @xmath9 value and find that a power - law model successfully explains the data ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , left ) .",
    "the best - fit value is @xmath32 , and we use this value throughout this paper .",
    "note that using @xmath32 does not change the other spectral parameters in table  [ ta : ta1 ] significantly .",
    "we find that using the wilm abundance model changes the best - fit @xmath9 values ( to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for obs .",
    "ids 0604700101 , 0694390101 and combined , respectively ) , but the other spectral parameters do not change significantly .",
    "we note that the source count rates were less than 0.030.08 cps for mos1/2 , and 0.10.3 cps for pn , and hence pile - up is not a concern .    for the _ nustar _ data , we extracted source and background events from circular regions with @xmath11 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "backgrounds were extracted in the same detector chip as the source , offset @xmath24@xmath37 from the source region .",
    "the source was detected above the background up to 2030kev .",
    "we grouped the spectra to have a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin , and used @xmath14 statistics and _ l _ statistics ; they provide consistent results .",
    "we jointly fit the data with a power - law model having different photon indexes for different orbital phases , and found that the best - fit parameters are @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "we find that a power - law model with a constant photon index across orbital phases can also explain the data if we let the flux vary between phases .",
    "however , a model with separate spectral indices for different phases provides a significantly better fit than one with constant phase - independent index throughout the phases , having an f - test probability that the improvement is just due to statistical chance of @xmath44 . using separate power - law indexes for the three observations taken at @xmath40 does not improve the fit .",
    "furthermore , individual fits of the observations suggest that the photon index is statistically the same among the observations taken at @xmath40 and that the photon index at phase 0 is different from that at phase 0.2 .",
    "we show the _ nustar _ spectra in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] and the fit results in figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] .    for the _ swift _ data ,",
    "we extract the spectra using the same regions as for the timing analysis ( section  [ timingana ] ) .",
    "the center of the source extraction circle was determined for each observation separately .",
    "since the source spectral properties vary with orbital phase @xcite , we performed phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "we folded the observations using the new timing solution we found in section  [ timingana ] and merged the data in each phase bin , for a total of twelve phase bins .",
    "we further produced two spectra for phase 0 , one for the high - flux state and another for the rest of the observations taken at that phase , and eleven spectra for the other phases hence producing a total of thirteen spectra .",
    "we grouped the data to have 1 count per energy bin because of the paucity of counts in some phase bins , and used _",
    "l _ statistics . for the phases that have enough counts , we also tried to fit the spectra using @xmath14 statistics , after grouping to have more than 20 counts per energy bin , and found that the results are consistent with those obtained using _",
    "l _ statistics .",
    "we then fit all 13 spectra jointly with an absorbed power - law model with a common @xmath9 ( frozen at the _ xmm - newton_-measured value of @xmath45 ) throughout the observations but a separate photon index and flux for each spectrum .",
    "we find that the power - law model explains the data with photon indices of @xmath46 and 310kev fluxes of @xmath47@xmath48 , where the maximum flux was for the high - flux state ( see figures  [ fig : fig2 ] b and c ) .",
    "we also tried to determine @xmath9 at each orbital phase using the _ swift _ data .",
    "however , we were able to constrain the fit parameters reasonably only for phase 0 ( without the high - flux state ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum for phase 0 ( excluding the high - flux state ) with a power - law model , and find that the best - fit parameters are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this @xmath9 value at phase 0 is consistent with those obtained using the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for phases 0.3 and 0.6 above , suggesting that @xmath9 does not strongly vary as a function of orbital phase .",
    "although we can not clearly rule out orbital variation of @xmath9 , a @xmath210% variation of @xmath9 does not significantly change the _ swift _ results .",
    "accretion - powered neutron star hmxbs often show spectral features such as emission lines or an exponential cutoff in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "we find that the x - ray spectrum of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 is well described with a power - law model without requiring any additional features ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "for example , fitting the spectrum for phase 0 with a cutoff power - law model ( pow*highecut in xspec ) does not improve the fit , and the best - fit parameters are not constrained .",
    "we further changed the spectral grouping in order to have the spectra cover a broader energy range , and to see if a cutoff is required at higher energy .",
    "specifically , we grouped the _",
    "nustar _ spectra to have more than 15 counts per energy bin , covering the 370kev band .",
    "we fit the spectra with a power - law model and a cutoff power - law model , and found the same results as above ; no cutoff is required in the fit .",
    "we performed additional analysis to determine the lower limit for the cutoff energy ( @xmath52 of the highecut model ) .",
    "however , it is not possible to set a meaningful lower limit for @xmath52 without constraining the e - folding energy ( @xmath53 of the highecut model ) .",
    "we therefore limit @xmath53 bewteen 6kev and 12kev , values obtained for a sample of accretion - powered neutron star hmxbs @xcite , and found that the 90% lower limit for @xmath52 is 39kev and 34kev for @xmath53 of 6kev and 12kev , respectively .",
    "note that some accretion - powered black hole binaries are known to have the cutoff energy above 70kev and that our data are not sensitive to such high energy cutoff .",
    "the spectral hardness varies with orbital phase ( figure  [ fig : fig2]c ) and flux ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows an apparent correlation between flux and spectral hardness .",
    "we fit the apparent correlation with a constant function and found that it does not provide an acceptable fit ( @xmath54dof=55/18 ) .",
    "we therefore added a linear slope to the constant function and find that the linear fit explains the data well ( @xmath14/dof=17/17 ) .",
    "the measured slope is @xmath55 ( per @xmath56 ) , consistent with that reported by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit function is shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that there is evidence for a correlation between x - ray flux and spectral hardness . with the new and larger dataset ,",
    "it is clear that the two quantities are correlated .",
    "for example , we find that the spearman s rank order correlation coefficient is @xmath57 and the significance is @xmath58 .",
    "we further verified that the x - ray flux and the photon index vary orbitally using the @xmath14 test , which resulted in @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "note that whether or not we include the high - flux data point in the correlation calculation does not significantly change the result .",
    "although the significance for the correlation is high , uncertainties in the measurements are significant ( see figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) and need to be considered for the significance calculation . in order to do so , we performed simulations .",
    "note that the photon index and the flux are correlated in the spectral fit , and one needs to take into account the covariance .",
    "we do this by using the covariance matrices in the simulation as was done by @xcite . in 100,000 simulations ,",
    "a non - negative correlation occurred 316 times , which suggests that the significance of the negative correlation is @xmath299.7% .",
    "we also carried out simulations for the linear correlation , and measured the confidence level of the negative linear correlation to be @xmath299.9% .",
    "we also checked for short - term variability ( @xmath210ks ) using the longer _ xmm - newton _ observation ( obs .",
    "i d 0694390101 ) because it has the best statistics .",
    "we calculate the count rate and hardness ratio ( ratio of count rates in two energy bands ; e.g , @xmath61 ) on various time scales and energy bands .",
    "we find variabilities of @xmath220% and @xmath210% for the count rate and hardness ratio , respectively , but no correlation between them .",
    "our analysis of the _ nustar _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ data is largely consistent with the x - ray results reported by @xcite , but the current work provides improvements and refinements .    first , using longer _",
    "swift _ observations , we find that the orbital period of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 is @xmath1days , consistent with the gamma - ray measurement ( @xmath4days ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when folded on the new period , the light curve shows two distinct features ; a spike at phase 0 and a broad sinusoidal hump ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , similar to those reported previously @xcite . with the new period measurement , however , we find that the spike at phase 0 is a persistent feature and shows less orbit - to - orbit variability than was suggested by @xcite .",
    "second , we clearly see the correlation between flux and spectral hardness for which @xcite found only marginal evidence . this is possible thanks to more sensitive observations made with _ nustar _ , _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton_.    note that we combined all the _ swift _ observations taken over a period of @xmath22000days for the spectral analysis .",
    "if there is long - term ( @xmath62 ) and/or short - term ( 10100ks ) variability , the combined results may be incorrect .",
    "this is a concern because there are only a few observations per orbital phase bin , and individual exposure of the observations is only @xmath2ks .",
    "furthermore , if the orbital period is not accurate or varies with time , phases of later observations will change , introducing an additional error to the analysis .",
    "however , the agreement of the _ swift _ measurements with the _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ results suggests that the errors may not be large compared to the statistical uncertainties , having no significant impact on the results . for example , the significance of the correlation between flux and photon index is still @xmath6399% when adding 10% systematic uncertainty to the _ swift _ measurements .",
    "the broadband x - ray spectra of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 at phases 0 and 0.2 are well described with a power - law model in the 0.540 kev band .",
    "recently , @xcite find that , based on parameter space consistent with radial velocity measurements , a neutron star model is preferred over a typical stellar mass black hole , although both classes are still allowed for 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 .",
    "we check to see if the source shows any evidence for accretion , such as line features or an exponential cutoff in the x - ray spectrum , as is often seen in neutron star hmxbs , and find none ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we find no clear evidence for an exponential cutoff at @xmath64kev ( for spectrum at phase 0 ) .",
    "we , therefore , set the 90% lower limit for @xmath52 to be 3439kev for e - folding energies of 612kev ( @xmath53 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the range of @xmath53 of neutron star hmxbs ) .",
    "this lower limit is large for a neutron star hmxb ( typical @xmath65kev ; e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "note that the x - ray pulsar x  per ( also known as 4u  0352@xmath66309 ) for which @xcite did not find a clear spectral cutoff turned out to have a cutoff at 69kev @xcite , which is comparable to the energy under which we did not find any evidence for a spectral cutoff in 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 .",
    "also , high cutoff energies @xmath6370kev have been seen in black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not clearly rule out the possibility that 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 is a black hole binary or a neutron star bianry with unusually high cutoff energy based only on the spectral cutoff .",
    "nevertheless , the continuum spectrum of x  per or other x - ray binaries is very complex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while we see a simple power - law spectrum for 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 .",
    "this suggests that 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 may be a non - accreting neutron star system , which has also been suggested for another gamma - ray binary ls  5039 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in analogy to ls  5039",
    ", we may identify the location of the sinusoidal x - ray peak at @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) as inferior conjunction , and the gamma - ray peak at @xmath68 @xcite as superior conjunction @xcite .",
    "then , the phase difference of @xmath69 between the two conjunctions implies that the orbit is eccentric .",
    "we note , however , that it is not clear whether the x - ray and gamma - ray peaks are physically related to the conjunctions or the apastron / periastron passages , and that alignment of the x - ray and gamma - ray peaks with inferior and superior conjunctions may not be precise .",
    "therefore , more observations and detailed modeling are required in order to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "we find that the x - ray spectral properties of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 clearly show orbital modulation .",
    "pulsar models for gamma - ray binaries often attribute such orbital modulation with orbital variation in the adiabatic cooling timescale @xcite , the electron injection spectrum , or the location and the shape of the wind nebula @xcite .",
    "the pulsar models have been applied to the similar system ls  5039 ( e.g. , spectral variability and recurring x - ray flares ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have reproduced the overall spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , whether or not these models can explain the spiky feature at phase 0 we see in 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 needs to be investigated .",
    "we note that the high - flux state observed with _ swift _ at phase 0 ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a and b ) is not reproduced in other observations taken at the same phase .",
    "it may be because the two observations in the high - flux state were made in a very narrow phase interval and the later observations did not cover that phase interval .",
    "in order to see if this is the case , we first verified that the high - flux state was not produced by short timescale variability ( @xmath2ks ) ; it lasted for the full duration of the exposures of the observations ( 24 ks at mjd  55585.7 and 7 ks at mjd  55618.7 for obs .",
    "ids 00031912004 and 00031912011 , respectively ) which cover a phase interval of @xmath70 ( at @xmath71 for @xmath72days ) .",
    "we then measured the phases of the other observations .",
    "we find that there are four observations made at the high - flux phase interval , and none of them was in the high - flux state .",
    "since the phase of an observation can change significantly for a different orbital period , we further varied @xmath19 within the measurement uncertainty of @xmath73day , and find the same result .",
    "this suggests that there is orbit - to - orbit flux variability at phase 0 .",
    "we find that the duration of the high - flux state is longer than 24ks and shorter than 1.8days .",
    "the minimum duration is set to be 24ks because the high - flux states last during the observation ( see above ) .",
    "the maximum duration is set to be the interval between a high - flux state and the next non - high - flux observation , which is 1.8days for both high - flux states . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the observational properties of the flare such as duration and orbital repeatability look more like that of ls  5039 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than those of ls",
    "i  @xmath6661@xmath10303 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may support the idea that the flares are produced by clumpiness of the stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the stellar companion ( be star ) of ls  i  @xmath6661@xmath10303 is different from those ( o stars ) of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 and ls  5039 as the flare properties do .",
    "however , how the clumpiness produces flares at one orbital phase for 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 or ls  5039 but not at random orbital phases needs to be further investigated .",
    "we present results of _ nustar _ , _ swift _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the gamma - ray binary 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 . using the _ swift _ data",
    ", we measured the orbital period of the source to be 16.544@xmath740.008 days , in agreement with the refined gamma - ray measurement of @xcite .",
    "the new period is only slightly different from that used in our previous x - ray study , and hence our spectral and temporal analysis results agree well with the previous x - ray measurements .",
    "we find that the flux enhancement at phase 0 occurs more regularly in time than was suggested previously based on _ swift _ data .",
    "the new _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ data allow us to show clearly the correlation between x - ray flux and spectral hardness of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 .",
    "finally , the broadband x - ray spectrum of 1fgl  j1018.6@xmath05856 suggests that it may not be an accretion - powered system .",
