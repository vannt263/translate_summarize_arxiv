    "the role of large - scale shell - model calculation has been increasing in nuclear structure physics with the recent development of faster parallel - computing capabilities . the most popular method to perform shell - model calculations",
    "is the lanczos method and its variants , which can handle @xmath0 configurations .",
    "however , the feasibility of this method is still hampered by the exponential increase of the hilbert space of the model space as a function of the number of nucleons . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "much effort has been given to developing approximation schemes to an exact shell - model diagonalization method .",
    "these approximation methods truncate the whole hilbert space to a relatively small subspace which is determined by various sophisticated methods .",
    "therefore , the approximated energy in the subspace always provides us with an upper limit to the exact energy because of the variational principle , and an unavoidable small gap remains between the approximated energy and the exact energy .",
    "this gap can be removed by extrapolation , which has been intensively studied from various perspectives .",
    "the fundamental ingredient of these studies is the extrapolation of the approximated eigenenergy by expanding the subspace into full hilbert space .",
    "one realization of this spirit is the exponential convergence method ( ecm ) @xcite , in which the approximated eigenenergy is extrapolated as an exponential function of the dimension of the truncated subspace .",
    "another scheme of the extrapolation is utilizing the energy variance of a sequence of the approximated wave functions @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", the approximated eigenenergy is extrapolated as a polynomial function of the corresponding energy variance because the energy variance of the exact wave function vanishes .",
    "the uncertainty of the extrapolated energy is expected to be small because the function used for extrapolation is a first- or second - order polynomial , while the corresponding function is exponential in the ecm .",
    "this energy - variance extrapolation ( eve ) was introduced in condensed matter physics @xcite and applied to various approximations in nuclear shell - model calculations .    in this article",
    ", we report how the eve method works with the approximated wave function represented by the linear combination of the parity , angular - momentum projected slater determinants , such as the monte carlo shell model ( mcsm ) @xcite . a case",
    "in which the eve is difficult is reported in ref .",
    "we discuss the origin of this case with relation to shape coexistence and how the case is solved by choosing an appropriate reordering of the slater determinants .",
    "we explain the variational calculation to generate a sequence of approximated wave functions using the mcsm and conjugate gradient ( cg ) method @xcite in sect.[sec : wf ] .",
    "in sect.[sec : simple_eve ] , we discuss how the simple eve method works .",
    "we also show a typical case in which the eve shows a poor result . in sect.[sec : eve_reord ] , we introduce the reordering technique of the extrapolation method to remedy this difficulty , and demonstrate the feasibility of the method .",
    "we briefly describe how to construct the truncated subspace to the full hilbert space in the nuclear shell - model calculations .",
    "the approximated wave function is written as a linear combination of angular - momentum - projected , parity - projected slater determinants , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of the basis states , which corresponds to the `` mcsm dimension '' in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is the angular - momentum , parity projector defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the euler angles , and @xmath6 denotes wigner s @xmath7-function .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the parity transformation .",
    "each @xmath9 is a deformed slater determinant , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes a creation operator of single particle state @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes an inert core .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 is determined by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the subspace spanned by the projected slater determinants , @xmath15 .",
    "this diagonalization also determines the energy , @xmath16 , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "note that the dimension of the subspace is the product of the number of states , @xmath2 , and the degree of freedom of the @xmath17-component of angular momentum , @xmath18 .",
    "we increase @xmath2 until @xmath19 converges enough , or the extrapolated energy converges .    the coefficient @xmath20 is given by a variational calculation utilizing the auxiliary field monte carlo technique and the cg method .",
    "each @xmath20 is determined by minimizing @xmath21 while keeping @xmath22 , in a manner similar to the mcsm @xcite , the few - dimensional basis approximation @xcite , and the hybrid multideterminant method @xcite .",
    "we perform the mcsm procedure in a small number of steps to get the initial states of the cg process in order to avoid a trap by local minima .",
    "since the @xmath20 is determined sequentially , hereafter , we call this procedure the sequential conjugate gradient ( scg ) method",
    ".    the energy variance of the approximated wave function @xmath23 is also evaluated as @xmath24 .",

    "our method is a `` variation after projection '' .",
    "the @xmath25ge is a typical case such that the relation between the energy and its variance is not monotonic , which is reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "this nucleus exhibits a feature of shape coexistence due to the @xmath26 magicity @xcite , and this is considered to be a main reason for ill - behavior as will be discussed later . in the @xmath25ge shell - model calculation , we take the @xmath27-shell , which consists of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 single - particle orbits , as a model space and the effective interaction jun45 is used @xcite .",

    "[ ge72_pes ] ( a ) , the overlap probability is rather small and 0.54 at most . the circles with relatively large overlap scatters in a broad region of the energy surface .",

    "this means that the wave function can be well approximated by a few number of projected slater determinants , or mean - field description works far better than in the case of the @xmath34 state .",
    "this property makes the first few scg basis states for minimizing @xmath34 energy dominated by the @xmath36 state , not by the @xmath34 state .",
    "these different properties of the @xmath34 and @xmath36 wave functions give rise to the different behavior of energy convergence as a function of the number of basis states , which makes extrapolation with a number of basis states difficult @xcite .    in fig .",

    "this situation may occur in the case where the next lowest energy eigenvalue is close to the target one and the mean - field solution favors the next lowest state .",

    "the scg wave function comprises a set of @xmath53 basis states , @xmath9 with @xmath54 .",
    "these basis states also give us a sequence of approximated wave functions , @xmath23 with @xmath55 , which is used for the simple eve method .",
    "meanwhile , reordering these @xmath53 basis states using a permutation , @xmath56 , yields another sequence of approximated wave functions , @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding energy @xmath59 , and the energy variance @xmath60 provide us with a new ev plot . by reordering the basis states with @xmath56",

    "we remove an anomalous behavior of the ev plot and make the extrapolation stable by using an appropriate @xmath56 .",
    "we describe the way how to obtain an appropriate order of basis states in this section .",
    "the relation of the energy and its variance is usually assumed to be expressed as a second - order polynomial . because a second - order - term error is roughly estimated as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a second - order - term error of @xmath63-square fitting , the uncertainty of the second order term often causes a relatively large error of the extrapolated value in case @xmath64 , is not small enough . if we can find an order of the basis states in which the fitted curve is a first - order polynomial , the error of the extrapolation will come mainly from the coefficient of the first - order term , which can be estimated as roughly proportional to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the first - order - term error of @xmath63-square fitting .",
    "this error should be far smaller than that of second - order polynomial if @xmath64 is large .",
