    "the study of the ideal bose gas is a standard topic in any treatment of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example . )",
    "the usual assumption made is that the bulk , or thermodynamic , limit is taken where the total number of particles and volume of the system are taken to infinity with the particle density fixed .",
    "in such a limit , some of the thermodynamic quantities that describe the system , such as the specific heat at constant volume , are not smooth functions of the temperature indicating that a phase transition occurs .",
    "this phase transition is usually interpreted as bose - einstein condensation of the gas .",
    "if we do not take the bulk limit , by keeping the volume of the system finite , then thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat remain smooth functions of temperature .",
    "( this was emphasized by van hove  @xcite for instance . )",
    "this smooth behaviour has been borne out in a number of different studies ( see the review of pathria  @xcite and references therein ) , and will be shown below .",
    "nevertheless , it seems intuitively plausible that as we let the volume of the system become very large , but still finite , the difference between the non - smooth behaviour in the bulk system and the smooth behaviour in the finite system should become less .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to study in some detail using analytical methods how the bulk limit is approached .    in order to make the calculations as simple as possible",
    "we will limit our attention to a three - dimensional space with only one compact dimension .",
    "the compact dimension will be chosen to be a circle .",
    "we will impose periodic boundary conditions for the circular direction and then study what happens when the radius of the circle tends to infinity .",
    "a mathematical technique , used previously to study the bose gas in a harmonic oscillator potential  @xcite , and a charged bose gas in a constant magnetic field  @xcite , is used to obtain accurate asymptotic expansions for a number of thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "a short discussion is given at the end of the paper .",
    "we begin with a flat spatial region that is taken to be a finite volume box of dimensions @xmath0 in the @xmath1 directions respectively .",
    "the schrdinger field will be chosen to obey periodic boundary conditions on the box walls .",
    "we will be interested in the limit where @xmath2 so that the spatial region is topologically @xmath3 .    under these conditions",
    "the energy levels , with @xmath4 initially finite , are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the total particle number is @xmath7 with @xmath8 the chemical potential and @xmath9 the inverse temperature ( in units where the boltzmann constant is taken equal to unity ) . because the ground state energy vanishes",
    ", it is clear that @xmath10 gives the ground state particle number .",
    "bose - einstein condensation viewed as a phase transition can only occur if @xmath11 at some temperature , defined as the critical temperature .",
    "a crucial feature of a finite volume system , or a semi - infinite one such as we have here , is that there will be no phase transition characterized by @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , if we view bose - einstein condensation as defined by a sudden buildup of particles in the ground state over a very small change in temperature , then this can occur even for a finite volume system .",
    "an important example of where this happens is for the harmonically confined bose gas  @xcite .",
    "the principle aim of this paper is to study what happens to the system when the size of the confining volume is varied . in the present setup",
    ", this corresponds to changing the circumference of the circle .",
    "it proves convenient to define two dimensionless parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 by @xmath14 if we let @xmath4 become large , then we can approximate the sums over @xmath15 and @xmath16 that occur in ( [ 2.3 ] ) with integrals and obtain @xmath17 the number density is therefore @xmath18    we wish to compare our results for finite @xmath19 with those found in the bulk , or thermodynamic , limit found when @xmath20 . in this limit",
    "we can replace the sum over @xmath21 with an integral and find the bulk limit to be the standard result of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the polylogarithm function .",
    "the critical value of @xmath24 at which @xmath11 in the bulk limit will be defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26    even if we keep @xmath19 finite , so that the bulk approximation is not made , we can still define @xmath27 as the temperature at which the density @xmath28 is given by the right hand side of ( [ 2.10 ] ) .",
    "we will define @xmath29 and call @xmath30 the value of @xmath13 at the temperature @xmath27 . using ( [ 2.10 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) leads to the relation @xmath31 the point of doing what we have done is that instead of specifying a particle density , we can specify a value for @xmath32 instead .",
    "the relation ( [ 2.12 ] ) determines @xmath13 as a function of @xmath12 for a given value of @xmath32 . by looking at different values of @xmath32",
    "we can see how results alter as @xmath19 is changed .",
    "this is completely equivalent to solving for the chemical potential as a function of temperature for a given particle number density , but is better suited to the analytical approximations that we will obtain in the next section .",
    "the result of solving ( [ 2.12 ] ) numerically for different values of @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that there is a sharp decrease in @xmath13 over a very small range of @xmath12 . from ( [ 2.4 ] ) with ( [ 2.5 ] ) this can be seen to correspond to a sudden increase in the number of particles in the ground state , and hence to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "note that smaller values of @xmath32 correspond to larger values of @xmath19 from ( [ 2.11 ] ) . as @xmath32 decreases , the value of @xmath12 at which @xmath13 undergoes its sudden decrease from values of the order of 1 to values much smaller than 1 , comes closer and closer to the value @xmath32 .",
    "in this sense , as @xmath19 increases we have a situation that starts to look more and more like a phase transition .",
    "we emphasize that there is no true phase transition here because we never attain the value @xmath33 for any finite value of @xmath19 .    in the bulk limit",
    "the specific heat has the familiar peak at the critical temperature @xmath27 .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "we also show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for comparison . )",
    "we now wish to see what happens when @xmath19 is finite .",
    "the absence of a phase transition in this case indicates that the specific heat should be smooth , unlike the situation for the bulk approximation where the derivative of the specific heat is discontinuous at @xmath34 .",
    "the internal energy is given by @xmath35 taking @xmath4 to be large , and replacing the sums over @xmath15 and @xmath16 with integrals again leads to @xmath36 from this result we can compute the specific heat at constant volume from @xmath37 after some calculation , it can be shown that @xmath38 where @xmath39    given the numerical solution for @xmath13 found from ( [ 2.12 ] ) , it is a straightforward task to evaluate the sums in ( [ 2.17][2.20 ] ) and thereby to find the specific heat for given values of @xmath32 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for sample values of @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath32 decreases , corresponding to increasing @xmath19 and becoming closer to the bulk approximation , the specific heat maximum shifts closer to @xmath40 and the shape of the curve near the maximum becomes more pointed .",
    "this corresponds to what would be expected heuristically , with the bulk approximation becoming indistinguishable from the exact result as @xmath19 becomes larger .",
    "the key ingredient of the method we will use consists of converting the infinite summations that occur in the expressions of the previous section to a contour integral using the mellin - barnes representation for the exponential , @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a real constant chosen so that the contour lies to the right of all poles in any of the resulting expressions .",
    "the contour is then closed in the left hand of the complex plane and the result evaluated by residues .",
    "this method was used previously  @xcite to obtain analytical expressions for the harmonically confined bose gas .",
    "we will give a brief description of the method for the sum that occurs in ( [ 2.12 ] ) and then simply quote the results for the other sums that are needed .",
    "define @xmath43 start by expanding the logarithm in its taylor series and then make use of ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath44 where we have defined @xmath45 the summation in ( [ 3.4 ] ) converges for @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath47 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) so that all possible poles in the integrand lie to the left of the contour . in the appendix",
    "we show that @xmath48 is an analytic function of @xmath49 except at @xmath50 for @xmath51 where simple poles occur with residue @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , @xmath48 is analytic at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 has a simple pole with residue 1 .",
    "the analytic continuation of @xmath48 to @xmath53 is given in ( [ a7 ] ) .",
    "we therefore find the asymptotic expansion @xmath55    an analysis similar to that that we have just described for @xmath56 may be applied to the other sums that occur in ( [ 2.17][2.20 ] ) .",
    "the results are @xmath57 these results should all be viewed as asymptotic expansions in @xmath13 and @xmath12 that are valid when @xmath13 and @xmath12 are both small .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this is the case by comparing the numerical evaluation of the sums in ( [ 2.17][2.18 ] ) with these analytic expansions .",
    "the advantage of the method is that when @xmath12 is small the direct numerical evaluation of the sums becomes more difficult because they start to become only slowly converging .",
    "when @xmath12 becomes large enough so that the analytical approximations break down ( typically @xmath12 of the order of 0.5 ) , the direct evaluation of the sums becomes simple as they converge rapidly .",
    "it is now straightforward to find an expansion for the specific heat using the analytical results of ( [ 3.5][3.9 ] ) in ( [ 2.16 ] ) .",
    "we find , after some calculation , @xmath58 where the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 are defined by @xmath61 only the first few terms are displayed here .",
    "this gives us an analytical approximation to ( [ 2.15 ] ) that is valid for small @xmath12 and @xmath13 . with",
    "@xmath24 fixed , as we let @xmath20 we have @xmath62 so that only the first term in ( [ 3.10 ] ) survives .",
    "this is the familiar value of the specific heat maximum from the bulk approximation .",
    "if we keep @xmath19 finite , then for small @xmath13 it can be shown that @xmath63 , showing that the peak in the specific heat is smaller than that occurring in the bulk limit .",
    "this is consistent with what we found numerically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    using our analytical approximation ( [ 3.5 ] )",
    "it is possible to obtain an approximate solution to ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "this will enable us to study the manner in which the chemical potential vanishes as @xmath20 and the bulk limit is reached .",
    "we have called @xmath30 the value of @xmath13 when @xmath40 ( corresponding to the temperature @xmath34 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) ) .",
    "we then have @xmath64 for small @xmath32 ( corresponding to large @xmath19 ) .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath32 we may ignore the second term in ( [ 3.13 ] ) and find @xmath65 the numerical value of this is @xmath66 , a result that shows up in the numerical evaluation of ( [ 2.12 ] ) as @xmath32 is decreased .",
    "the next order correction to the result in ( [ 3.14 ] ) will be a term of order @xmath67 . by expanding ( [ 3.13 ] ) and working consistently to order @xmath67 it may be shown that @xmath68 in a similar way , more terms in the expansion can be evaluated if desired . if we use ( [ 3.15 ] ) in ( [ 2.6 ] ) , we can conclude that for large values of @xmath19 the value of the chemical potential @xmath8 at @xmath34 is , @xmath69 the next order term inside the braces is of the order @xmath70 .",
    "as we let @xmath20 , it is seen that @xmath71 as expected .",
    "our calculation has established in a precise way exactly how the bulk limit is reached",
    ".    for temperatures that are close to @xmath34 , a simple extension of the approximate solution to ( [ 2.12 ] ) that we have presented gives @xmath72 to lowest order .",
    "again it is straightforward to obtain higher order terms in the expansion if needed .",
    "we have studied the ideal bose gas concentrating on the way that the bulk limit is reached .",
    "reliable asymptotic expansions of relevant thermodynamic quantities have been obtained and compared with numerical results .",
    "the agreement was good in regions where the asymptotic expansions are expected to be valid .",
    "it was shown how the large volume limit of the finite volume system mimics the behaviour of the bulk infinite volume system . with more work it is possible to see how the derivative of the specific heat with respect to temperature becomes discontinuous as the bulk limit",
    "is approached .    for simplicity of presentation",
    "we have only studied the situation for a 3-dimensional space with one compact circular direction .",
    "there is nothing to stop a similar analysis being applied to a space of arbitrary dimension , to more than one compact dimension , or to different boundary conditions .",
    "it would also be possible to perform a similar analysis for the relativistic bose gas and compare with the results of shiokawa and hu  @xcite . finally , it would be of interest to study the inclusion of interactions to the analysis",
    ". this might be possible using the @xmath73-function method in ref .",
    "in this appendix we outline a derivation of the pole structure of @xmath48 using the same methods as in the main text of the paper .",
    "we begin by using the standard integral representation  @xcite for the @xmath74-function , assuming initially that @xmath46 so that the sum in ( [ 3.4 ] ) converges .",
    "this gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( it can be noted that @xmath77 is related to the @xmath78-function  @xcite , but we do not use this result here . ) because we assume @xmath79 , and we have @xmath80 as @xmath81 , the integrand of ( [ a1 ] ) is well - behaved for large @xmath82 no matter what the value of @xmath49 . any poles of @xmath48 must therefore come from the small @xmath82 behaviour of the integrand .    to get the behaviour of the integrand of ( [ a1 ] ) for small @xmath82 , we first use ( [ 3.1 ] ) to find that @xmath83 the contour in ( [ a3 ] ) may be closed noting that there are simple poles at @xmath84 and @xmath85 only . evaluating the residues at these poles results in @xmath86 as @xmath87 , a result that agrees with what is found using @xmath78-function identities  @xcite . if we use @xmath88 to mean the pole part of any expression , then it is clear that @xmath89 ( in the last line we have simply expanded @xmath90 in its taylor series and integrated the result . )",
    "this shows that @xmath48 has simple poles at @xmath50 with residues @xmath91 for @xmath51 .",
    "although this method is a quick way to uncover the pole terms , if we need to know @xmath48 at values of @xmath49 where the result is analytic , then a more elaborate analysis must be performed .",
    "this has been done by ghika and visinescu  @xcite and in a more general case by ford  @xcite .",
    "ford s result gives us @xmath92 the poles terms found in ( [ a5 ] ) agree with what is found from this exact result . by letting @xmath93 in ( [ a6 ] ) it is easily seen that @xmath94 we also need the value at @xmath95 , a result that is easily obtained by noting that @xmath96 ( this follows from a straightforward differentiation of ( [ 3.4 ] ) . )",
    "making use of ( [ a7 ] ) and letting @xmath93 in ( [ a8 ] ) gives @xmath97 this is a standard result  @xcite and provides a useful check on the results ."
