    "anderson s spin - wave theory ( swt ) provides a good description for the low temperature properties of many two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum antiferromagnetic systems on a bipartite lattice @xcite , including quantum corrections to the classical nel ground state with two alternating sublattices and the doublet transverse spin - wave excitations .",
    "the quantum antiferromagnetic systems on a triangular lattice , however , are the prototypal system with the frustrated spin alignments in the classical picture and have been under intensive study over the last few decades for fundamentally different type of ground states @xcite .",
    "it is now firmly established by various methods @xcite , including a swt based one three - sublattices @xcite , that the ground state of the antierromagnetic heisenberg model has the long - ranged noncollinear order of the @xmath2 magnetic three - sublattice structure with three transverse , gapless spin - wave excitations .",
    "most isotropic antiferromagnets in one - dimension ( 1d ) with low quantum spin numbers do not show nel - like long - ranged order in the ground state due to the strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the low - lying excitation states are also different from the 2d and 3d counterparts . in particular , by the exact solutions using the bethe ansatz @xcite , the low - lying excitation states of the 1d spin-1/2 heisenberg model have been shown corresponding to the spin-1/2 object ( spinons ) where the spin - wave - like excited states are the triplet states of spinons which always appear in pairs @xcite , contrast to the doublet excitation states by swt ; the excitation states of spin-1 heisenberg model for the linear chain , including the longitudinal one , have an excitation gap above the singlet ground state , first predicted by haldane @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions have later been confirmed in the antiferromagnetic compound kcuf@xmath3 for spin-1/2 chains @xcite and csnicl@xmath3 for spin-1 chains @xcite by neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "one interesting remaining question is whether or not there exist longitudinal excitations in quantum antiferromagnetic systems with long - ranged classical order in low temperature , as such modes will represent the oscillations in the magnitude of the long - ranged order parameter .",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "there is now ample evidence of the longitudinal excitation states in various quasi-1d structures with the nel - like long - ranged order at low temperature , including the hexagonal @xmath4-type antiferromagnets with both spin quantum number @xmath5 ( csnicl@xmath6 and rbnicl@xmath6 ) @xcite and @xmath7 ( csmni@xmath6 ) @xcite and the tetragonal structure of kcuf@xmath6 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more recently , a longitudinal mode was also observed in the dimerized antiferromagnetic compound tlcucl@xmath6 under pressure with a long - ranged nel order @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "no observation of longitudinal modes in any 2d or quasi-2d antiferromagnets has been reported yet .",
    "clearly , such longitudinal modes , which correspond to the oscillations in the magnitude of the magnetic order parameter , are beyond the usual swt which predicts only the transverse spin - wave excitations , usually referred to as quasiparticle magnons in the antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "there are several theoretical investigations in these longitudinal modes using the field theory approach , such as a simplified version of haldane s theory for the spin-1 systems @xcite or the sine - gordon theory for the spin-1/2 systems @xcite , and both treating the inter - chain couplings as perturbations .",
    "a phenomenological field theory approach focusing on the spin frustrations of the hexagonal lattice of the @xmath4-type antiferromagnetic systems has also been made @xcite .",
    "we recently proposed a microscopic many - body theory based on the magnon - density waves for the longitudinal excitations of spin-@xmath9 quantum antiferromagnetic systems , using the original bipartite spin - lattice hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the basic physics in our analysis follows feynmann s theory on the low - lying excited states of the helium-4 superfluid @xcite : the longitudinal excitation states in a quantum antiferromagnet with a nel - like order are identified as the collective modes of the magnon - density waves , which represent the fluctuations in the long - range order and are supported by the interactions between magnons ; these longitudinal excitation states are constructed by the magnon density operator @xmath10 in contrast to the transverse spin - flip operator @xmath11 of the magnon states @xcite .",
    "our numerical results @xcite for the energy gap values at the magnetic wave vector are in good agreement with the experiments for the energy gap observed in the tetragonal structure of kcuf@xmath6 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we hope that more experimental results for the energy spectra at other wavevectors will be available for comparison .    in this article , we extend our microscopic approach to study the longitudinal modes in quantum antiferromagnets on a triangular lattice where the magnetic order is noncollinear hence there are possible more than one longitudinal modes .",
    "we employ the approximate swt ground state in our calculations and find that one of the longitudinal modes is gapless for the isotropic models in the thermodynamic limit , due to the slow divergence of the structure factor , but any finite size effect or small anisotropy will induce a large energy gap at the magnetic wavevectors when compared with the counterpart of the transverse spin - wave spectra , similar to the collinear square lattice model .",
    "we organize this article as follows . for completeness",
    ", we briefly outline the main results of spin - wave theory for the triangular lattice model in sec .",
    "2 , using the one - boson approach .",
    "we then apply our microscopic theory for the longitudinal excitations in sec .",
    "3 , using the approximated ground state from swt .",
    "we find that a large energy gap can be induced by a very tiny anisotropy , similar to the square lattice model .",
    "we also discuss the possible other longitudinal mode of the triangular lattice and the possible extension of our calculations to the more realistic models in the quasi-1d systems such as those hexagonal @xmath4-type antiferromagnets mentioned above in the last section .",
    "the classical ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice consists of three alternating sublattices with spins on each sublattice align at an angle of @xmath12 to the other two sublattices .",
    "the distance between the two nearest - neighbor spins of the same sublattice is @xmath13 of the lattice spacing which is taken as unity in this article .",
    "the spin-@xmath9 heisenberg hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coupling parameter and the sum on @xmath16 runs over all the nearest - neighbor pairs of the triangular lattice once . following singh and huse @xcite and miyake @xcite",
    ", it is convenient to transform the hamiltonian of eq .   by rotating the quantum projection axis of the spins along the classical direction in the @xmath17-plane at the six @xmath18-sublattices surrounding the one @xmath19-sublattice .",
    "this transformation leads to the following rotated spin operators , @xmath20 for all @xmath18 sites , where @xmath21 is the magnetic ordering wavevector at the corner of the hexagonal brillouin zone of the triangular lattice ( see fig .",
    "after the rotation of eq .  , the spin - wave theory can be formulated in terms of only one set of bosons , rather than three sets originally employed @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian operator of eq .",
    "after this transformation is given by @xmath22(s_i^xs_j^x+s_i^zs_j^z)+\\delta s_i^ys_j^y\\nonumber\\\\      & + \\sin[\\mathbf q\\cdot(\\mathbf r_i-\\mathbf r_j ) ]      ( s_i^zs_j^x - s_i^xs_j^z)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also introduced an anisotropy parameter @xmath23 along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "we will see later that even a very tiny anisotropy , such as @xmath25 , will induce a large energy gap for the longitudinal excitation spectrum at the magnetic wavevectors @xmath26 when compared with the counterpart of the spin - wave spectra . using the conventional holstein - primakoff transformations , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "can be expressed in terms of boson operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 in a series in power of @xmath9 .",
    "the classical result for the ground - state energy is given by the @xmath29 term .",
    "the linear terms ( i.e. , linear in @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) cancel each other out .",
    "the quadratic terms are in @xmath31 and are retained in the linear swt . the cubic terms ( in @xmath32 ) and the quartic terms ( in @xmath33 ) have been treated as perturbations for the higher - order corrections to the linear swt @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian of the linear swt is given by , keeping only the @xmath29 and @xmath31 terms and after a fourier transofrmation for the boson operators with the fourier component operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined by @xmath39 respectively and @xmath40 is defined as usual by @xmath41 with the summation over the nearest - neighbor index @xmath42 and the coordination number @xmath43 for the triangular lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath44 is diagonalized by the canonical bogoliubov transformation , @xmath45 , @xmath46 where , @xmath47 , is the spin - wave excitation spectrum with the dimensionless spectrum @xmath48 given by @xmath49 we plot the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of the triangular lattice and the dimensionless energy spectrum @xmath48 of eq .   in fig .  1 .",
    "this spin - wave spectrum has three zero modes , one at the center of the zone @xmath50 ) , and the other two at the corners of the bz , the @xmath26 ordering wavevectors .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - wave velocity near these points are different , with values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the sublattice magnetization @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 with the magnon density @xmath55 defined as the ground - state expectation value of boson number operator @xmath56 with value @xmath57 for the isotropic model in the linear swt .",
    "this magnon density of @xmath57 per lattice site is larger than the corresponding number of @xmath58 for the square lattice model , indicating the larger quantum correction in the triangular lattice model due to the frustration .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the three sublattice magnetization are noncollinear with @xmath12 between their directions , hence we may have two longitudinal modes in the triangular lattice model , one corresponding to the @xmath59-component magnon - density fluctuations in our rotated spin basis discussed above , the other corresponding to the perpendicular @xmath60-component magnon - density fluctuations . in the following section , we will discuss the longitudinal excitations in the @xmath59-component magnon - density fluctuations , similar to the collinear square lattice case where there is only one longitudinal mode and leave the discussion of the other possible longitudinal mode to the last section .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the longitudinal excitations in an antiferromagnetic system with a nel - like long - ranged order correspond to the fluctuations in the order parameter . we have proposed a microscopic approach based on the magnon - density waves and have applied to bipartite antiferromagnetic systems where the magnetic order is collinear @xcite . here",
    "we extend our analysis to triangular lattice models using the one - boson approach for the approximation of the ground state and investigate the longitudinal mode of the @xmath59-component magnon - density fluctuations .",
    "briefly , the excitation state of the @xmath59-component magnon - density waves is constructed by applying the magnon - density operator @xmath61 to the ground state @xmath62 , @xmath63 where the density operator @xmath61 , instead of the spin - raising and lowering operators @xmath11 for the transverse spin - wave excitations ( i.e. magnons ) , is given by @xmath10 operator as @xmath64 where the index @xmath65 runs over all lattice sites and the condition @xmath66 ensures that the excited state @xmath67 is orthogonal to the ground state . we notice that in our rotated spin basis of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the three sublattice magnetizations all point in the same @xmath59-direction . the longitudinal excitation spectrum",
    "is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by the ground - state expectation value of a double commutator as @xmath70\\rangle_g,\\ ] ] and the state normalization integral @xmath71 is the structure factor of the lattice model @xmath72 in eqs .   and , the notation @xmath73 indicates the ground - state expectation .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the double commutator for triangular lattice by employing the one - sublattice hamiltonian of eq .",
    "after the rotation to obtain the following general expression , @xmath74      \\big[\\langle s_l^zs_{l+\\rho}^x\\rangle_g-\\langle s_l^xs_{l+\\rho}^z\\rangle_g\\big]\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we apply the approximation of the linear swt for the ground state in the expectations @xmath73 and obtain @xmath75,\\ ] ] where the transverse correlation functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are defined as @xmath78 both independence of index @xmath65 due to the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "their fourier transformations are obtained as , using the approximation of the linear swt for the ground state in the one - boson approach discussed in sec .  2 , @xmath79 and where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are as given by eqs .  .",
    "we obtain the numerical results at the isotropic point @xmath80 as @xmath81 and @xmath82 for all the six nearest neighbors .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath69 is dominated by @xmath83 .    within the same approximation of the linear swt for the ground state , the structure factor @xmath71 of eq .",
    "is obtained as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is as given by eq .  , @xmath55 is the magnon density as discussed before and @xmath86 we notice that the structure factor of eq .",
    "involves the double magnon spectrum function @xmath87 in the integrals , indicating some effects of the interactions between magnons has been included .",
    "we then obtain the longitudinal excitation spectrum @xmath88 of eq .   using the approximations of eqs .   and .",
    "by numerical evaluation , we notice that this spectrum of the longitudinal mode is the gapless in the thermodynamic limit , approaching zero @xmath89 at both @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "detailed numerical analysis shows that the gapless spectrum is due to the slow , logarithmic divergence in both the second and third terms in the structure factor @xmath71 of eq .  .",
    "more specifically , near @xmath92 and @xmath26 , we find that @xmath93 , and thus the excitation spectrum @xmath94 as @xmath95 or @xmath96 , but with different coefficients for the @xmath92 point from that of the @xmath26 points .",
    "this later feature is reminiscent of the different spin - wave velocities at these points as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the major difference between the longitudinal and transverse modes near @xmath92 and @xmath26 points will become apparent once we introduce the anisotropy as discussed in the followings .",
    "the logarithmic behaviors of the structure factor and of the energy spectrum of triangular lattice model is similar to that of the square lattice model studied earlier @xcite , where we state that the spectrum is quasi - gapped as any finite finite size effect or anisotropy will induce a large energy gap when compared with the counterparts of spin - wave spectrum .",
    "here we consider the effect of anisotropy in the @xmath24-axis as given by eq .  .",
    "for a small value of @xmath25 , we obtain energy gap value of @xmath97 at the ordering wavevector @xmath26 , compared with the much smaller gap value of @xmath98 of the corresponding spin - wave spectrum .",
    "more specifically , we find that the longitudinal energy gap value is proportional to @xmath99 $ ] , in contrast to the spin - wave gap which is proportional to @xmath100 , when @xmath101 .",
    "we notice that the spectrum is still gapless at @xmath92 due to the fact that the anisotropy @xmath102 is introduced in the @xmath24-component in the hamiltonian of eq .   while the spins are ordered along the rotated @xmath59-axis . in order to make further comparison between the longitudinal mode and the transverse spin - waves mode , we plot both the spectra with @xmath25 in fig .  [ 6 ] along the path @xmath103 of the bz .",
    "the different gap values for the longitudinal and transverse mode at both @xmath104 and @xmath105 points can be clearly seen .",
    "both the longitudinal and spin - wave spectra at @xmath0 are still gapless where @xmath106 for any value of @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , there are slight different peak values at for the longitudinal spectrum but for the spin - wave spectrum the peak values are nearly equal .",
    "this is again similar to the case of the square lattice model discussed earlier @xcite , indicating some effects of the interaction between magnons in the longitudinal mode .     of the longitudinal mode together with spin - wave excitation spectrum @xmath107 along ( @xmath108 ) of the bz with an anisotropy @xmath25 .",
    "the gap value at @xmath104 and @xmath105 points is @xmath97 for the longitudinal mode , and @xmath98 for the transverse spin - wave modes.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we now turn our attention to the difference in the excitation spectra between the triangular and square lattice models .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated by the linear swt for both models . due to the frustrations in the triangular lattice ,",
    "there are three sublattice magnetizations with @xmath12 different orientation to one another rather than the two sublattices with complete opposite orientation ( @xmath109 ) in square lattice .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath110 is introduced in the @xmath24 components of the hamiltonian of eq .   rather than in the usual the ordered direction of the @xmath59 components for the square lattice model , hence the spin - wave spectra of the triangular anisotropic model are still gapless at the @xmath92 point .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropy parameter @xmath102 inside the square root formula of the spin - wave spectrum of eq .   is linear rather than the usual quadratic form for the bipartite models such as the square lattice model .",
    "all these features of the triangular lattice model contribute to the slightly softer nature of the longitudinal model than that of the square lattice model .",
    "in particular , the energy gap values for the longitudinal mode is about @xmath97 at @xmath105 and @xmath111 at @xmath92 for the triangular lattice model with the anisotropy @xmath25 as given before , comparing with the bigger energy gap values of @xmath112 at @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath92 for the square lattice model at the similar value of the anisotropy @xmath115 which enters the hamiltonian in the ordered @xmath59 component @xcite .",
    "more significantly , due to the fact that antiferromagnetic order is noncollinear in triangular lattice , in additional to the above discussed longitudinal model corresponding to the @xmath59-component order parameter fluctuations , we may have another longitudinal mode corresponding to the perpendicular @xmath60-axis fluctuations .",
    "we leave further discussion to the following section .",
    "in this paper , we have applied our microscopic analysis based on the magnon - density waves to study the longitudinal excitations of the @xmath59-component order parameter fluctuations for a triangular lattice antiferromagnets , with the results similar to those of the square lattice model . in particular ,",
    "the longitudinal spectrum for the isotropic model has zero modes at the zone center and the magnetic wavevectors due to the slow , logarithmic divergence of the structure factor . also similar to the square lattice model , any finite size effect or anisotropy",
    "will induce large energy gaps at the magnetic wavevectors when compared with the counterparts of the transverse spin - wave excitations .",
    "furthermore , we find the longitudinal modes of the triangular lattice models are in general softer than that of the square lattice model due to the frustrations in the triangular lattice model . due to the fact that the magnetic order in the triangular lattice is noncollinear",
    ", there may exist another longitudinal mode , corresponding to the order parameter fluctuations in the perpendicular @xmath60 direction . instead of the density operator of eq .",
    ", we use the operator @xmath116 , for the density fluctuations in the x - direction .",
    "we will report the results for this longitudinal mode elsewhere .",
    "one remaining question is the intrinsic lifetime of the longitudinal modes for triangular lattice model . as the results in sec .",
    "3 demonstrate that the energy of the longitudinal mode is always higher than that of the transverse spin - wave excitations , we expect the longitudinal mode in the pure triangular lattice model may be unstable against decaying into two or more magnons , as emphasized in ref",
    ".  28 and in a more recent discussion @xcite .",
    "one way to find the stable longitudinal modes is to consider some frustrated models in triangular lattices near a quantum critical point where the sublattice magnetization is much reduced @xcite .",
    "a more realistic way is to consider some quasi-1d hexagonal systems as mentioned in sec .",
    "i. it is therefore particularly interesting to extend our present analysis to the hexagonal @xmath4-type antiferromagnets with both spin quantum number @xmath5 ( csnicl@xmath6 and rbnicl@xmath6 ) @xcite and @xmath7 ( csmni@xmath6 ) @xcite , where the longitudinal energy gaps were first observed at the magnetic wavevectors .",
    "the spin lattice structure on the basal planes of these systems are triangular as that discussed here .",
    "the field theory approach proposed by afflect based on haldane s theory of spin-1 ( or integer spin quantum number ) chain with five fitting parameters is able to explain many features observed , but there are still some disagreements particularly for the data away from the minimum energy gap at the antiferromagnetic wavevectors @xcite .",
    "we believe that the longitudinal excitations of the quasi-1d antiferromagnets is more general than the extension of haldane s theory of integer spin quantum chains and that our microscopic analysis based on the magnon - density waves as presented here may provide a more general description of such longitudinal modes without any fitting parameter other than those in the model hamiltonian .",
