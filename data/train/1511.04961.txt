    "the phenotypic diversity of a species impacts its ability to evolve . in particular ,",
    "the importance of the variance of the population along a phenotypic trait is illustrated by the _",
    "fundamental theorem of natural selection _",
    "@xcite , and the _ breeder s equation _",
    "@xcite : the evolution speed of a population along a one dimensional fitness gradient ( or under artificial selection ) is proportional to the variance of the initial population .",
    "recently , the phenotypic variance of populations has also come to light as an important element to describe the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems ( where many interacting species are considered ) @xcite .    over the last decade ,",
    "the thematic of _ evolutionary rescue _ has emerged as an important question @xcite ( see also the seminal work of luria and delbrck @xcite ) , and led to a new interest in the phenotypic distribution of populations , beyond phenotypic variance .",
    "evolutionary rescue is concerned with a population living in an environment that changes suddenly",
    ". the population will survive either if some individuals in the population carry an unusual trait that turns out to be successful in the new environment , or if new mutants able to survive in the new environment appear before the population goes extinct ( see @xcite for a discussion on the relative effect of _ de novo mutations _ and _ standing variance _ in evolutionary rescue ) . in any case , the fate of the population will not be decided by the properties of the bulk of its density , but rather by the properties of the tail of the initial distribution of the populations , close to the favourable traits for the new environment .",
    "a first example of such problem comes from emerging disease @xcite : animal infections sometimes are able to infect humans .",
    "this phenomena , called zoonose , is the source of many human epidemics : hiv , sars , ebola , mers - cov , etc .",
    "a zoonose may happen if a pathogen that reaches a human has the unusual property of being adapted to this new human host .",
    "a second example comes from the emergence of microbes resistant to an antimicrobial drug that is suddenly spread in the environment of the microbe .",
    "this second phenomenon can easily be tested experimentally @xcite , and has major public health implications @xcite .",
    "most papers devoted to the genetic diversity of populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait describe the properties of mutation - selection equilibria .",
    "it is however also interesting to describe the genetic diversity of population that are not at equilibrium ( _ transient dynamics _ ) : pathogen populations for instance are often in transient situations , either invading a new host , or being eliminated by the immune system .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review on transient dynamics in ecology . for asexual populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait ,",
    "several models exist , corresponding to different biological assumptions @xcite .",
    "if the mutations are modeled by a diffusion , the steady populations ( for a model close to , but where mutations are modelled by a laplacian ) are gaussian distributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have considered some transient dynamics for this model . in the model that we will consider ( see ) , the mutations are modelled by a non - local term .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that mutation - selection equilibria are then cauchy profiles ( under some assumptions ) , and this result has been extended to more general mutation kernels in @xcite , provided that the mutation rate is small enough .",
    "finally , let us notice that the case of sexual population is rather different , since recombinations by themselves can imply that a _ mutation - recombination equilibrium _ exists , even without selection .",
    "we refer to the infinitesimal model @xcite , and to @xcite for some studies on the phenotypic distribution of sexual species in a context close to the one presented here for asexual populations .    in this article , we consider a population consisting of individuals structured by a quantitative phenotypic trait @xmath6 ( @xmath7 open interval of @xmath8 containing @xmath9 ) , and denote by @xmath10 its density . here , the trait @xmath11 is fully inherited by the offspring ( if no mutation occurs ) , so that @xmath11 is indeed rather a breeding value than a phenotypic trait ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the individuals reproduce with a rate @xmath12 , and die at a rate @xmath13 this means that the individuals with trait @xmath14 are those who are best adapted to their environment , and that the fitness decreases like a parabola around this optimal trait ( this is expected in the surroundings of a trait of maximal fitness ) .",
    "it also means that the strength of the competition modeled by the logistic term is identical for all traits . when an individual of trait @xmath15 gives birth , we assume that the offspring will have the trait @xmath11 with probability @xmath16 , and a different trait @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath1 is then the probability that a mutation affects the phenotypic trait of the offspring .",
    "we can now define the growth rate of the population of trait @xmath11 ( that is the difference between the rate of _ births without mutation _ , minus the death rate ) as @xmath19 when a mutation affects the trait of the offspring , we assume that the trait @xmath17 of the mutated offspring is drawn from a law over the set of phenotypes @xmath20 with a density @xmath21 .",
    "the function @xmath22 then satisfies @xmath23 and we assume moreover that @xmath22 is bounded , @xmath24 , with bounded derivative and strictly positive on @xmath7 . the main assumption here",
    "is that the law of the trait of a mutated offspring does not depend of the trait of its parent .",
    "this classical assumption , known as _ house of cards _ is not the most realistic , but it can be justified when the mutation rate is small @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "all in all , we end up with the following equation : @xmath25 this paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of equation when @xmath26 is small and @xmath0 large and it is organized as follows . in the rest of section 1 the main results are quoted , first in an informal way , and then as rigourous statements .",
    "section 2 contains the proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] and its corollary and finally , in section 3 , theorem [ thm : smallt ] is proved .",
    "when we consider the solutions of , two particular profiles naturally appear :    * _ a cauchy profile : _ for a given mutation rate @xmath27 small enough , one expects that @xmath28 will converge , as @xmath0 goes to infinity , to the unique steady - state of , wich is the following cauchy profile @xmath29 where @xmath30 is such that @xmath31 .",
    "this steady - state of is the so - called _ mutation - selection equilibrium _ of the _ house of cards",
    "_ model , which has been introduced in @xcite ( we also refer to @xcite for a broader presentation of existing results ) . *",
    "_ a gaussian profile : _ if @xmath32 , the solution of ( [ eqq0 ] ) can be written @xmath33 where @xmath34 , so that a gaussian - like behavior ( with respect to @xmath11 ) naturally appears in this case",
    ". surprisingly , we are not aware of any reference to this property in the population genetics literature .",
    "we will show that , as suggested by the above arguments , we can describe the phenotypic distribution of the population , that is @xmath35 , when either @xmath36 ( large time for a given mutation rate @xmath37 ) , or @xmath38 ( small mutation rate , for a given time interval @xmath39 $ ] ) . before providing the precise statements of our results ( see subsection  [ subsec : rigorous ] ) , we will briefly describe them here , and illustrate them with numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in fig .  [ fig1 ] and fig .  [ fig2 ] are obtained thanks to a finite difference scheme ( explicit runge - kutta in time ) , and we illustrate our result with a single simulation of with @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( see the definition of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eqq4 ] ) below ) .",
    "the initial condition corresponds to a population at the mutation - selection equilibrium which environment suddenly changes ( the optimal trait originally in @xmath45 moves to @xmath14 at @xmath46 ) .",
    "this example is guided by the evolutionary rescue experiments described in subsection  [ subsec : sel - mut - comp ] , where the sudden change is obtained by the addition of e.g. salt or antibiotic to a bacterial culture .",
    "we describe two phases of the dynamics of the population :    * _ large time : cauchy profile .",
    "_ we show that @xmath28 is asymptotically ( when the mutation rate @xmath27 is small ) close to @xmath47 provided @xmath48 .",

    "an interesting and ( to our knowledge ) new feature described by our study is that the tails of the traits distribution in a population can change drastically between `` short times '' , that is @xmath54 and `` large times '' , that is @xmath48 : the distribution is initially close to a gaussian distribution , with small tails , and then converges to a thick tailed cauchy distribution .",
