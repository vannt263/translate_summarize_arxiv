    "since the terrestrial particles accelerators like large hadron collider probe particle physics at the energy scales that are almost @xmath4 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale , it would interesting to investigate whether or not various naturally occurring high energy astrophysical phenomenon could shed light on the new physics at higher energy scales that remain unexplored . stepping ahead towards this exciting possibility , an interesting proposal was made recently which suggests that the kerr black holes could act as particle accelerators@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the two particles dropped in from infinity at rest , traveling along the timelike geodesics can collide and interact near the event horizon of a kerr black hole with divergent center of mass energy , provided the black hole is close to being extremal and angular momentum of one of the particles takes a specific value of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the possible astrophysical implications of this process around the event horizon of the central supermassive black hole in the context of annihilations of the dark matter particles accreted from the galactic halo were also investigated @xcite .",
    "this process of particle acceleration suffers from several drawbacks and limitations pointed out in@xcite .",
    "the angular momentum of one of the colliding particle must take a single fine tuned value . the proper time required for the particle with fine tuned angular momentum to reach",
    "the horizon and thus the time required for the collision to take place is infinite .",
    "the gravity produced by the colliding particles themselves was neglected .",
    "there were many investigations of this acceleration mechanism in the background of kerr as well as many other black holes@xcite .",
    "two of present authors , pm and psj , studied and extended the particle acceleration mechanism to the kerr naked singular geometries transcending kerr bound by arbitrarily small amount @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we considered two different scenarios where the colliding particles follow a geodesic motion along the equatorial plane as well as along the axis of symmetry of the kerr geometry . in the first case ,",
    "the particles are released from infinity at rest in the equatorial plane .",
    "one of the initially infalling particle turns back as an outgoing particle due to its angular momentum .",
    "it then collides with an another infalling particle around @xmath6 .",
    "we showed that the center of mass energy of collision between these two particles is arbitrarily large .",
    "the angular momentum of the colliding particles is required to be in a finite range as opposed to the single fine tuned value in case of kerr black holes .",
    "thus the extreme fine tuning of the angular momentum is avoided in such a collision .",
    "the proper time required for such a collision to take place is also shown to be finite . in the second case , the particles are released from rest along the axis of symmetry , from large but finite distance .",
    "these particles have zero angular momentum .",
    "one of the particles initially falls in and then turns back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in the vicinity of a kerr naked singularity .",
    "this particle then collides with an ingoing particle at @xmath7 .",
    "the center of mass energy of collision is arbitrarily large and the proper time required for the process to take place is finite .",
    "thus two issues related to acceleration mechanism in kerr black hole case , namely the fine tuning of the angular momentum and the infinite time required for the collision , are avoided in case of kerr naked singularities .",
    "the issue of the self - gravity of the point particles is difficult to deal in general .",
    "the accretion of the particles onto an astrophysical object can be expected to be more or less isotropic in many cases .",
    "thus it would be interesting and more physical to study the motion and collisions of the shells of particles instead .",
    "the rigorous mathematical analysis of the shells would be very extremely difficult in the kerr spacetime due to the lack of sufficient symmetry .",
    "by contrast , the motion and collision of the spherical shells would be exactly tractable in the spherically symmetric spacetimes following the israels thin shell formalism@xcite .",
    "we first note that while no gravitational radiation is emitted by a perfectly spherical shell , the gravitational radiation per particle emitted by a quasispherical shell of particles will be significantly lower than the radiation emitted by a single particle@xcite",
    ". thus it might be reasonable to ignore the gravitational radiation effects and focus entirely on the backreaction while dealing with the shells .",
    "the acceleration of the particles around the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole was studied in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this process is mathematically similar to the acceleration process in kerr geometry .",
    "the center of mass energy of collision near the horizon of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole , of the charged and uncharged particles is shown to be divergent .",
    "the collision of the charged and uncharged spherical shells was investigated in@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the shells when their gravity is ignored is same as that of the test particles .",
    "whereas when the exact calculation is done taking into account the self - gravity effects , the center of mass energy turns out to be finite .",
    "thus it was speculated that the center of mass energy of collision of particles around kerr black hole might also turn out to be finite when the gravity due to the colliding particles is taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we first describe the particle acceleration process in the background of reissner - nordstrm naked singularities .",
    "we show that the center of mass energy of collision between two uncharged particles , one of them initially ingoing and other one initially ingoing , but turning back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in the vicinity of naked singularity is arbitrarily large , when the collision happens around @xmath8 , provided that the deviation of the reissner - nordstrm charge from the mass is extremely small .",
    "we calculate the coordinate time as seen by the distant observer , associated with the ultra - high energy collisions for extremal black hole as well as for naked singularity .",
    "we show that the time scale associated with the trans - plankian collisions around naked singularity with one solar mass is of the order of million years which is significantly smaller than the hubble scale , whereas the timescale for the extremal black hole with the same mass as that of the naked singularity is fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe .",
    "thus collision process around black hole suffers from the inflating timescale problem while such issue is absent in case of the naked singularity .",
    "we then investigate the collision between two uncharged shells made up of dust particles , in a situation analogous to the particle collision , taking into account their gravity .",
    "we find that the center of mass energy of a collision between the shells is bounded above .",
    "however , the center of mass energy of a collision between two of constituent particles of the shells can exceed the planck energy which might be a threshold value of the quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the geometrized unit in which the speed of light and newton s gravitational constant are unity .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm spacetime is a unique solution of einstein equations under the assumptions of spherical symmetry , asymptotic flatness with the @xmath9(1 ) gauge field as a source of spacetime curvature .",
    "the line element of the reissner - nordstrm geometry in the spherical polar coordinates is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 the gauge field is given by @xmath12 this solution contains two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , namely the mass and @xmath9(1 ) charge . in this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are positive , @xmath13    in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime , there is a spacetime singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "this singularity is timelike and thus is necessarily locally naked .",
    "the location of the horizon in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime is given by a solution to the equation @xmath15 .",
    "there are two roots to this quadratic equation given by @xmath16 there are two real positive roots to the equation if @xmath17 .",
    "the larger root @xmath18 is the location of the event horizon and this spacetime corresponds to a spherically symmetric charged black hole .",
    "the smaller root @xmath19 corresponds to the cauchy horizon associated with the timelike singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath20 , there is only one positive root . in this case",
    "the black hole is known as the extremal black hole with a degenerate event horizon at @xmath21 . in the case of @xmath22",
    ", there is no real root to the equation @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the event horizon is absent and the timelike singularity at @xmath14 is exposed to the asymptotic observer at infinity .",
    "this configuration thus contains a globally visible naked singularity .",
    "we will investigate the last case in this paper from the perspective of particle acceleration .    before proceeding further",
    ", it is worthwhile to mention that , the naked singularities are associated with pathological features like the breakdown of predictability and so on . that was precisely the reason why penrose came up with the cosmic censorship conjecture abandoning the existence of naked singularities in our universe@xcite .",
    "however there were recent developments in the framework in string theory , which suggests by means of the specific worked out examples , that the naked singularities might be resolved by high energy stringy modification to the classical general relativity @xcite and various pathological features disappear .",
    "this renders the classical naked singular solutions legal as long as one stays sufficiently away from high curvature region where quantum gravity would prevail .",
    "we now study the motion of a point test particle following a timelike geodesic in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",

    "we show that the time required for the planck - scale collisions around naked singularity is of the order of million years which is much smaller than the age of the universe . whereas the time scale in extremal black hole case in the analogous process is many orders of magnitude larger than the hubble time .",

    "particles participating in the collision are assumed to be test particles following the geodesics on the background geometry .",
    "the effects of gravity generated by the particles are ignored .",

    "the gravity of the shells is taken into account in an exact calculation , and the energy of collision between shells at  the center of mass frame \" is computed in a situation analogous to the test particle case .",
    "it is shown that , in this case , due to the condition that the outermost region is described by the over - charged rn spacetime , the center of mass energy of a collision between two of the constituent particles of the shells is bounded above .",
