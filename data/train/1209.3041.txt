    "one hundred years after its discovery by j.  j.  @xcite , the triatomic hydrogen ion h@xmath1 is still driving research at the forefront of astrophysics and molecular spectroscopy . since the publication of the classic papers on reaction networks in interstellar clouds by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "h@xmath1 has been recognized as a cornerstone of astrochemical models .",
    "detections of h@xmath1 absorption lines in the dense @xcite and diffuse @xcite interstellar medium were milestones for the discipline of astrochemistry and have profoundly impacted our understanding of molecule formation in interstellar space .",
    "today , h@xmath1 observations are routinely used to trace the cosmic ray ionization rate in the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "similar to h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 exists in two different nuclear spin modifications . if the three proton spins align to @xmath2 , ortho - h@xmath1 is formed ; if the nuclear spins combine to @xmath3 , para - h@xmath1 is formed .",
    "in both h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 the lowest rotational states are of para symmetry , the energy difference to the next higher ( ortho ) state is 170.5k in h@xmath0 @xcite and 32.9k in h@xmath1 @xcite . for all practical purposes ,",
    "the two different nuclear spin modifications can be considered different species and efficient interconversion can only be accomplished by exchange of protons in chemical reactions .",
    "recent evaluations of h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 observations @xcite in diffuse sightlines , found that the h@xmath1 nuclear spin excitation temperature @xmath4h@xmath1 ) is consistently lower than the excitation temperature @xmath5 of h@xmath0 , despite the fact that these two species undergo frequent collisions . while @xmath5 is typically @xmath670k , @xmath7(h@xmath1 ) tends to be around @xmath630k , implying an enrichment in the para - h@xmath1 population .",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath5 can be taken as the kinetic temperature of the cloud , indicating that there has to be a mechanism that shifts @xmath4h@xmath1 ) away from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "two different scenarios can be envisioned : ( i ) collisions between h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 result in a non - thermal nuclear spin distribution for h@xmath1 ; ( ii ) collisions between h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 are too infrequent or too inefficient in the diffuse interstellar medium to bring h@xmath1 into thermal equilibrium , therefore the formation and destruction processes dominate the observed nuclear spin fractions .    in the present work we address point ( i ) by presenting measurements of the para - h@xmath1 fraction in collisions with thermal h@xmath0 samples at interstellar temperatures .",
    "the h@xmath1 / h@xmath0 collision system has been the subject of previous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",
    "this work represents the first experimental study of h@xmath1/h@xmath0 nuclear spin exchange at interstellar temperatures @xmath8k .    in the following",
    ", we will abbreviate para - h@xmath1 by @xmath9-h@xmath1 and ortho - h@xmath1 by @xmath10-h@xmath1 . in the same way , para - h@xmath0 and ortho - h@xmath0",
    "will be denoted by @xmath9-h@xmath0 and @xmath10-h@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "normal - h@xmath0 , with a ( @xmath10-h@xmath0):(@xmath9-h@xmath0 ) ratio of 3:1 , will be abbreviated by @xmath11-h@xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following parameters to quantify the fractions of molecules in the para configuration : @xmath12 where the terms on the right - hand sides of the equations represent the number densities of the respective species .",
    "the measurements were performed using a chemical probing scheme in a temperature - variable 22-pole radiofrequency ( rf ) ion trap @xcite . in this spectroscopy approach",
    "the popualtions of the lowest rotational states of h@xmath1 are probed by a laser - induced reaction ( lir ) that leads to the formation of arh@xmath13 , which can be detected with very high sensitivity .",
    "the lir technique has been developed for spectroscopy of cold ions @xcite .",
    "the specifics for the spectroscopy of h@xmath1 have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite ; here we will give a brief overview .",
    "the h@xmath1 ions are produced in a ion source by electron impact ionization of h@xmath0 , followed by the exothermic h@xmath14 + h@xmath0 @xmath15 h@xmath1 + h formation reaction .",
    "the ions are extracted and guided into the 22-pole trap .",
    "the cylindrically symmetric rf trap consists of 22 stainless steel rods ( diameter 1 mm , length 40 mm ) that are planted alternatingly into two copper side plates . by applying rf fields ( @xmath617.7mhz ) of opposing sign to the side plates ,",
    "the ions are stored radially .",
    "the ions enter and leave the ion trap through small circular electrodes ( diameter 8 mm ) inside the side plates , which can be switched to load or unload the ion trap .",
    "the 22-pole geometry is chosen to minimize rf heating , and it has been shown that stored ions can be cooled down to their lowest rotational states in collisions with an inert buffer gas @xcite .",
    "the ion trap is mounted on a 10k cold head and the trap temperature can be varied using a small heating element .",
    "the temperature is measured by a calibrated silicon diode .    during ion storage helium and argon gas",
    "are continuously bled into the trap through dedicated gas lines .",
    "helium serves as buffer gas to sympathetically cool the h@xmath1 ions .",
    "collisional cooling with a neutral inert buffer gas allows for the cooling of translational as well as rovibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this cooling method is applicable to almost all stable molecular ions , and with helium as a buffer gas temperatures down to a few degrees kelvin can be reached .",
    "an overview of this cooling technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "the argon gas is used to facilitate the action spectroscopy scheme . in this spectroscopic approach",
    ", an endothermic chemical reaction is used that is triggered by the absorption of a photon .",
    "the reaction product is detected by a mass spectrometer with high sensitivity . for the present experiment ,",
    "the endothermic proton - hop reaction @xmath16 was utilized . for ground state h@xmath1",
    ", the reaction can not proceed .",
    "it becomes energetically possible when the h@xmath1 excitation overcomes the 0.55ev threshold , which is the case , e.g. , for any h@xmath1 ion with more than one vibrational quantum [ @xmath17+@xmath18@xmath19 1 , where @xmath17 and @xmath20 denote the quantum numbers in the symmetric stretch and asymmetric bending modes of h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for details on h@xmath1 nomenclature . ) a tunable diode laser ( 1.33 - 1.40@xmath21 m ) with an output power of 10 - 15mw is coupled in along the trap axis .",
    "it is suited to excite h@xmath1 from the three lowest - lying rotational states to the ( @xmath17@xmath22)=(03@xmath23 ) vibrational overtone ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . with a photon energy of @xmath60.9ev ,",
    "the laser - excited h@xmath1 ions are well above the threshold for reaction([eq : arh ] ) and thus the formation of arh@xmath13 is assumed to proceed rapidly .",
    "the spectra are taken by slowly scanning the laser over one of the three transitions , while repeatedly loading the ion trap and unloading it ",
    "after variable storage times  and counting the arh@xmath13 reaction product .      to probe the low - temperature equilibrium population of the lowest h@xmath1 states , we exposed the stored ions to h@xmath0 with a thermal nuclear spin fraction .",
    "we prepared gas samples with variable @xmath24 using a para hydrogen converter , consisting of a cryogenic container that is filled with a ferromagnetic catalyst .",
    "routinely , we prepared ca.600 mbar of pure @xmath9-h@xmath0 ( purity @xmath1999% ) in a 1liter lecture bottle that is lined with teflon to reduce back - conversion . in a second step ,",
    "we diluted the @xmath9-h@xmath0 gas with @xmath11-h@xmath0 until we reached the desired @xmath24 value .",
    "the mixtures were tested before and after each measurement by raman spectroscopy . for each measurement",
    "the temperature of the ion trap was chosen to corresponded to the excitation temperature of the measured @xmath24 value .",
    "typically , back - conversion during several days of measurement resulted in an increase of @xmath5 by 3k .",
    "furthermore , the low raman signal strength  caused by the relatively low pressure of the h@xmath0 mixtures ",
    "accounts for the uncertainty in @xmath24 of @xmath25 .    due to the ionization process and the exothermic formation reaction",
    ", approximately 2/3 of the @xmath6500 captured h@xmath1 ions are highly excited during the initial capture .",
    "they immediately react with ar to form arh@xmath13 .",
    "however , these arh@xmath13 ions react with h@xmath0 and undergo the exothermic back - conversion of reaction([eq : arh ] ) . using short trap loading and unloading cycles , we carefully monitored and adjusted the h@xmath0 pressure in the trap until the back conversion occurred with a time constant of @xmath610ms , thus assuring that the h@xmath0 number densities are comparable for each data point . within the first 50ms of the 500ms storage time ,",
    "all excited h@xmath1 ions are buffer gas cooled and the initial arh@xmath13 count has dropped below the background level of the detection system .",
    "lacking the option to directly use a pressure gauge inside the trap volume , we use readings at a remote gauge to estimate the helium number density inside the trap to be on the order of @xmath6@xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "the argon density is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than the helium density .",
    "it is adjusted such that it saturates the arh@xmath13 signal , i.e. , that every excited h@xmath1 ion finds an argon atom to react before the excitation decays .",
    "the hydrogen density is lower still and difficult to infer precisely .",
    "the best estimate comes from the 10ms time constant of the arh@xmath13+h@xmath0@xmath15ar+h@xmath1 back - reaction .",
    "however , this time constant is likely to reflect not only the reaction rate , but also the time that it takes the excited ions to cool below the reaction threshold , as those h@xmath1 ions that do not cool before the next collision with argon are likely to react again to form arh@xmath13 .",
    "assuming langevin rate coefficients for both the arh@xmath13/h@xmath0 and h@xmath1/h@xmath0 collision systems , we infer a lower limit of 60 h@xmath1/h@xmath0 collisions during the 500ms storage time , while the actual number may be quite a bit higher . to assure that the number of h@xmath0 collisions is sufficient to bring the nuclear spin of h@xmath1 into steady state , we performed a test with doubled storage time , which did not alter the results .",
    "for the last 50ms of storage , the diode laser is activated .",
    "the measured arh@xmath13 signal results from the competition between laser excitation initiating reaction ( [ eq : arh ] ) and the presence of h@xmath0 that causes the reverse reaction .",
    "the saturated arh@xmath13 signal following long exposure to the laser field ( long compared to the @xmath610ms decay time constant of the back - reaction ) is therefore directly proportional to the arh@xmath13 lifetime .",
    "consequently , it would be impractical to increase the number of h@xmath0 collisions by increasing the h@xmath0 number density inside the ion trap , as that would lead to a reduction of the arh@xmath13 signal strength .",
    "due to the time - consuming preparation and verification of the @xmath9-h@xmath0 samples together with careful adjustment of the relative gas densities and the slow scanning routine , each experimental @xmath28 value corresponds to more than one week of laboratory time .",
    "the he and h@xmath0 number densities in the present experiment are lower by at least three orders of magnitude compared to experiments in plasmas and discharges and thus 3-body collisions and disturbances of the h@xmath29 collision complex are unlikely .",
    "we expect collisions with helium to occur on a @xmath610@xmath21s time scale , while the lifetime of the h@xmath29 complex should be on the order of nanoseconds or shorter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the ions are produced in an external ion source and transferred into the ion trap , there are no free electrons interacting with the ions during storage .",
    "the laser is activated for the last 50ms of storage to achieve sufficient signal strength . during these 50ms ,",
    "it is conceivable that arh@xmath13 formation , followed by back - conversion to h@xmath1 via @xmath30 will change the ortho / para ratio of the stored ions . here",
    ", we will estimate the size of this effect .",
    "the formation rate of arh@xmath13 during the laser - on time is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath11(h@xmath1 ) is the h@xmath1 number density inside the trap , @xmath32 the fraction of h@xmath1 ions in a rovibrational state that can be excited by a given laser frequency @xmath33 , @xmath34 the einstein coefficient for that transition and @xmath35 the spectral energy density .",
    "the integral runs over the interaction volume which is defined by the spatial overlap between the laser beam and the ion cloud inside the trap .",
    "the parameter of interest is @xmath32 , which under constant measurement conditions is proportional to @xmath36 .    at a given frequency , the arh@xmath13 yield as a function of the laser - on time @xmath37 and",
    "the arh@xmath13 lifetime @xmath38 is @xcite @xmath39 for @xmath40 this leads to an asymptotic arh@xmath13 signal given by @xmath41 . from the measured @xmath42 and @xmath38",
    ", we determine the arh@xmath13 formation rate @xmath43 .",
    "for the strongest line ",
    "the @xmath44(1,0 ) @xmath10-h@xmath1 line  we have measured a signal strength of @xmath45 , which together with @xmath46ms corresponds to @xmath47s@xmath48 . during the 50ms laser - on time , this leads to a total of @xmath680 arh@xmath13 ions , a considerable fraction of the @xmath6500 stored ions . to derive how many of these arh@xmath13 ions will end up as @xmath10-h@xmath1 and @xmath9-h@xmath1 , respectively",
    ", we use the nuclear spin selection rules for reaction ( [ eq : back ] ) . the analogous case of spin statistics for the proton transfer between o@xmath0 and h@xmath0",
    "is described by @xcite , and has recently been studied experimentally by @xcite . for this exothermic proton exchange reaction",
    ", we assume that the nuclear spin selection rules hold .",
    "the fraction of arh@xmath13 ions that will populate is ( @xmath49 , while ( @xmath50 ) of the arh@xmath13 ions will form @xmath9-h@xmath1 . for any given transition",
    ", this effect will result in the depletion of the nuclear spin manifold that is being probed .",
    "for the analysis we assume that the laser interaction will not affect the relative strength of the two para lines ( and thus the rotational temperature ) , as the frequent helium collisions will keep the rotational states within the para manifold in equilibrium .",
    "the depletion effect should be most pronounced for the @xmath44(1,0 ) ortho line , firstly because @xmath44(1,0 ) is the strongest line , and secondly because for high @xmath24 values , most of the arh@xmath13 ions will be converted to @xmath9-h@xmath1 .",
    "the possible influence of the laser interaction therefore leads to increased uncertainty limits towards small values of @xmath28 .",
    "for the data point with the highest @xmath24 value this corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath611% in @xmath28 . the effect is included in the total uncertainty for each data point .",
    "this procedure may over - estimate the effect , because during the 50ms laser - on time , further h@xmath1/h@xmath0 collisions will shift the populations back towards equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , a strong laser depletion would deform the lineshapes of the measured transitions and we see no indication of that in our data .",
    "the chemical probing spectra for the different values of @xmath24 are shown in figure[fig2 ] . plotted are normalized arh@xmath13 count rates for the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 transitions , respectively .",
    "the linewidths are dominated by the doppler width , which is on the order of @xmath54mhz at 70k .",
    "the lines were fitted with gaussian profiles and translational temperatures were extracted from the width of the strongest line @xmath51 . from the relative arh@xmath13 yield of the @xmath52 and",
    "the @xmath53 transitions , which are both within the para manifold , the rotational temperature @xmath55 was derived , using the einstein coefficients of @xcite .",
    "assuming that the rotational populations are in equilibrium among the para- and ortho states , we calculated the fractional populations @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the lowest para ( 1,1 ) and ortho ( 1,0 ) levels , respectively , within the ortho and para manifolds for the given value of @xmath55 . then we used the measured arh@xmath13 yields @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the @xmath52 and @xmath51 transitions , normalized to the einstein @xmath34 coefficients to derive the relative para and ortho populations using @xmath60 from these populations we calculated @xmath28 for the stored h@xmath1 ions using the analog of equation ( [ eq : p3 ] ) .",
    "all temperatures as well as the @xmath24 and @xmath28 values are given in table1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in figure[fig3 ] the measured equilibrium values are compared to astronomical observations .",
    "the observational h@xmath1 data are taken from @xcite , the h@xmath0 data from @xcite and @xcite ; they represent diffuse molecular clouds with average kinetic temperatures between 5070k and h@xmath0 column densities on the order of 10@xmath61@xmath62 .",
    "the experimental results are close to the thermal curve , while the interstellar observations exhibit distinctly larger values of @xmath28 .",
    "also plotted is the outcome of a chemical kinetics model @xcite , based on rate coefficients calculated using the micro - canonical model of @xcite .",
    "as detailed in the original publication , the model requires three parameters as input , namely the branching fraction @xmath63 between the proton - hop and proton exchange channels , the fraction @xmath64 of the identity reaction and the temperature @xmath7 .",
    "here we adopt @xmath65 , as observed recently in a liquid - nitrogen cooled discharge @xcite .",
    "the identity branching fraction has a minor impact on the equilibrium conditions , here we used @xmath66 .",
    "the model results agree very well with the experimental values .",
    "the present measurements show that the nuclear spin equilibrium of h@xmath1 in collisions with h@xmath0 is close to the expected thermal values .",
    "the discrepancy with the observations in diffuse sightlines remains , consequently , it appears that in these interstellar environments , h@xmath1 / h@xmath0 collisions are too infrequent to bring the two species into equilibrium .",
    "@xcite have shown that the nascent @xmath28 value originating from the h@xmath14 + h@xmath0 @xmath67 h@xmath1 + h formation reaction is likely to follow a linear trend ( plotted in fig.[fig3 ] ) with @xmath68 .",
    "the present results nurture the assumption that h@xmath1 might be formed along the nascent line and has not reached the thermal curve yet in the observed environments .",
    "the dominant destruction process of h@xmath1 in the diffuse medium is the dissociative recombination ( dr ) with free electrons .",
    "the number of reactive collisions @xmath69 with h@xmath0 that an h@xmath1 ion experiences in its lifetime can be estimated by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the rate coefficients for reactive h@xmath0 collisions and dr , respectively",
    ". adopting values of k@xmath73@xmath74s@xmath48 @xcite and @xmath75@xmath74s@xmath48 @xcite together with a n(h@xmath0)/n(e@xmath76 ) ratio of @xmath77 , we expect @xmath640 collisions per lifetime . while that number may be sufficient for thermalization , a smaller rate coefficient for reactive collisions , as suggested by deuteration experiments described by @xcite , would result in @xmath67 collisions , which may not be enough for thermalization .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that more recent measurements by @xcite with a similar setup resulted in larger rate coefficients , more in line with the current assumptions .",
    "another source of uncertainty for the astrophysical @xmath28 value is the nuclear - spin dependence of the dr rate coefficient .",
    "recent calculations by @xcite suggest a large difference of almost an order of magnitude between @xmath9-h@xmath1 and @xmath10-h@xmath1 at low temperatures .",
    "incidentally , the calculated rate coefficient for @xmath9-h@xmath1 is higher , which aggravates the problem since this would lead to a depletion of @xmath9-h@xmath1 .",
    "presently , the theoretical calculations are supported by afterglow experiments @xcite , while measurements in storage rings see only a slight enhancement in the rate coefficient of @xmath9-h@xmath1 @xcite , however , the sampled temperatures in the storage rings may be too high @xcite .",
    "as the present measurements indicate that the irregular nuclear spin populations of h@xmath1 do not have their origin in the h@xmath1 / h@xmath0 collision process itself , strengthened efforts to understand the h@xmath1 formation and destruction processes , as well as an accurate determination of the absolute rate coefficient of the thermalizing collisions with h@xmath0 , are called for .",
