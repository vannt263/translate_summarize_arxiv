    "interaction between these systems can be described as the special case of the van der waal long range forces caused due to the fluctuating dipole moments of the systems @xcite .",
    "these interactions can enable many chemical reactions like charge - exchange and molecule formations at the single particle level , hence better understanding of these interactions is very useful in a number of studies such as explaining the underlying reasons for various quantum phase transitions @xcite , improvising quantum computing techniques  @xcite , establishing sustained atom - ion sympathetic cooling mechanism  @xcite , designing ultracold superchemistry  @xcite , studying the physics of impurities in the bose gases  @xcite , interpreting cold atom collision processes  @xcite etc .",

    "although there have been attempts to study the atom - ion interactions in the past , but the reported results were not very accurate . due to the experimental advancements in the atom - ion trapping experiments , it is now the time to provide more accurate description of these potentials to infer important signatures of new physics . owing to the simplified and well understood structures of the alkali atoms and alkaline - earth ions , they seem to be the natural choices and of immense interest for the experimental investigations @xcite for which we intend to carry out accurate theoretical studies of the long - range atom - ion interactions among these systems . in this work ,",
