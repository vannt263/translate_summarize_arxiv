    "in recent years , a wealth of precise cosmological observations have been used to place tight constraints on the values of the fundamental cosmological parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the unexpected conclusion from these studies is that we seem to live in a more complex and richer universe than originally suspected ; one which is currently undergoing a phase of accelerating expansion .",
    "understanding the origin of cosmic acceleration is one of the most outstanding problems in physics as it may hold the key to a true revolution in our understanding of the universe .    within the context of general relativity",
    ", cosmic acceleration implies that the energy - density budget of the universe is dominated by a dark energy component , which counteracts the attractive force of gravity . a key parameter that can be used to characterize this component is the dark energy equation of state @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of its pressure to density . in the standard @xmath0cdm model",
    ", dark energy can be described by a fixed equation of state specified by @xmath14 , which can be interpreted as the quantum energy of the vacuum .",
    "however , a large variety of alternative models have been proposed , which predict different values of @xmath13 and its possible evolution with time ( for a review see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe are expected to play a major role at shedding light on the causes of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , @xmath15 , and its fourier transform , the two - point correlation function @xmath16 , encode useful information which can be used to obtain robust constraints , not only on dark energy , but also on other important physical parameters like neutrino masses , the curvature of the universe or details of inflationary physics @xcite .",
    "a special feature of large - scale clustering measurements provides a powerful method to probe the expansion history of the universe : the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "these are a series of small amplitude oscillations imprinted on the power spectrum @xcite , which are analogous to the acoustic oscillations present in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum . in the correlation function",
    "these are transformed into a single peak whose position is related to the sound horizon at the drag redshift @xcite .",
    "as this scale can be calibrated to high precision from cmb observations , bao measurements at different redshifts can be used as a standard ruler to measure the distance - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "the bao feature was first detected in the clustering pattern of the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",

    "several ground - breaking galaxy surveys are currently being constructed or designed which will be substantially larger than their predecessors . the ongoing baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an example of these new surveys .",

    "this information will provide a high - precision determination of the expansion history of the universe through accurate measurements of the bao feature in the large - scale galaxy clustering .",
    "boss will also attempt to obtain , for the first time , bao measurements at high redshift ( @xmath20 ) through the ly@xmath21 forest absorption spectra of about 150,000 quasars .",
    "the increasing precision of the new surveys demands accurate models of the lss observations to extract the maximum amount of information from the data without introducing biases or systematic effects .",
    "the bao signal in the correlation function and power spectrum is modified by the non - linear evolution of density fluctuations , redshift - space distortions , and galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "these effects must be taken into account in the models used to interpret the observations .",
    "new developments in perturbation theory , such as renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have provided substantial progress regarding the theoretical understanding of the effects of non - linear evolution , which can now be accurately modelled @xcite , and even partially corrected for @xcite . based on rpt , @xcite proposed a simple model to describe the full shape of the correlation function on large scales .",

    "the same ansatz has been used by @xcite and @xcite for the analysis of the correlation functions of the 6df and wigglez galaxy surveys , respectively .",
    "an analogous approach was used by @xcite to study the cosmological implications of the lrg power spectrum in sdss - dr7 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the parametrization of @xcite to the redshift - space correlation function of a high redshift galaxy sample from boss data release 9 ( dr9 ) .",

    "we review the most important details of the construction of the sample ( section  [ ssec : cmass ] ) , and our clustering analysis ( section  [ ssec : clustering ] ) .      the galaxy target selection of boss consists of two separate samples , dubbed lowz and cmass , designed to cover different redshift ranges ( * ? ? ?",

    "these samples are constructed on the basis of @xmath23 colour cuts designed to select luminous galaxies at different redshifts at a roughly constant number density .",
    "spectra of the lowz and cmass samples are obtained using the double - armed boss spectrographs , which are significantly upgraded from those used by sdss - i / ii , covering the wavelength range 3600   to 10000   with a resolving power of 1500 to 2600 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are then measured using the minimum-@xmath24 template - fitting procedure described in @xcite , with templates and methods updated for boss data as described in @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the clustering properties of the cmass sample , which is selected to be an approximately complete galaxy sample down to a limiting stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the cmass sample is dominated by early type galaxies , although it contains a significant fraction of massive spirals ( @xmath2526 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the galaxies in this sample are central galaxies , with a @xmath2510 per cent satellite fraction @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents a detailed description of the construction of the catalogue for lss studies based on this sample , and the calculation of the completeness of each sector of the survey mask , that is , the areas of the sky covered by a unique set of spectroscopic tiles @xcite , which we characterize using the mangle software @xcite .",
    "we only include sectors with completeness larger than 75% .",
    "our results are not affected by this limit , as this leaves out only a small fraction of the total dr9 area .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the redshift range @xmath26 , producing a final sample of 262,104 galaxies , of which 205,947 and 56,157 are located in the northern and southern galactic hemispheres , respectively .",
    "[ fig : map ] shows the angular footprint , in galactic coordinates , of the resulting sample for the northern ( left ) and southern ( right ) galactic caps ( hereafter ngc and sgc , respectively ) , colour - coded according to sector completeness .",
    "@xcite compared the small and intermediate - scale clustering of this sample to the expectations of a flat @xmath0cdm cosmological model by applying an abundance matching technique to the multidark simulation . in three companion papers , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "study the signature of redshift - space distortions in this sample and explore its cosmological implications . here",
    "we focus on the shape of the large - scale monopole correlation function to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we characterize the clustering of the cmass galaxy sample by means of the angle - averaged redshift - space two - point correlation function @xmath22 . here",
    "we summarize the procedure we follow to obtain this measurement .",
    "the first step in the calculation of three - dimensional clustering statistics is the conversion of the observed redshifts into distances . for this",
    "we assume a flat @xmath0cdm fiducial cosmology with matter density , in units of the critical density , of @xmath27 , and a hubble parameter @xmath28 ( expressed in units of @xmath29 ) .",
    "this is the same fiducial cosmology assumed by @xcite and our companion papers @xcite . as will be discussed in section  [ ssec : info ] , the choice of the fiducial cosmology has implications on the resulting correlation function .",
    "we then compute the full correlation function @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the radial component of the separation vector @xmath33 , using the estimator of @xcite , namely @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the normalized pair counts in each bin of @xmath38 in the data and a random sample with 50 times more objects than the original data , constructed to follow the same selection function ( for more details on the construction of the random catalogue see * ? ? ?",
    "we infer the angle - averaged redshift - space correlation function as the monopole of @xmath30 , that is @xmath39 this method should be preferred over the commonly used one , in which the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 counts are integrated over @xmath40 before they are combined as in equation  ( [ eq : lys ] ) to compute @xmath22 , ignoring the fact that the geometry of the survey introduces a @xmath40 dependence on @xmath37 @xcite , although the differences between the two approaches are more significant for higher multipoles .    when computing the pair counts in equation  ( [ eq : lys ] ) , a few important corrections must be taken into account .",
    "this is done by assigning a series of weights to each object in the real and random catalogues .",
    "first , we apply a radial weight given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the expected number density of the catalogue at the given redshift and @xmath43 is a free parameter .",
    "@xcite showed that setting @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , minimizes the variance on the measured correlation function for the given scale @xmath46 .",
    "following standard practice we use a scale - independent value of @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite show that the full scale - dependent weight provides only a marginal improvement over the results obtained using this constant value .",
    "we include additional weights to account for non - random contributions to the sample incompleteness and to correct for systematic effects .",
    "the incompleteness in a given sector of the mask has a random component due to the fact that not all galaxies satisfying the cmass selection criteria are observed spectroscopically . in any clustering measurement",
    "this is taken into account by down - sampling the random catalogue in that region of the sky by the same fraction .",
    "however , there are two other sources of missing redshifts which require special treatment : redshift failures and fibre collisions",
    ".    even when the spectrum of a galaxy is observed , it might not be possible to obtain a reliable estimation of the redshift of the object , leading to what is called a redshift failure . as shown in @xcite , the probability that a spectroscopic observation leads to a redshift failure is not uniform across the field since these tend to happen for fibres located near the edges of the observed plates .",
    "hence , these missing redshifts can not be considered as an extra component affecting the overall completeness of the sector .    however , the main cause of missing redshift is fibre collisions @xcite .",
    "the boss spectrographs are fed by optical fibres plugged on plates , which must be separated by at least 62@xmath48 .",
    "it is then not possible to obtain spectra of all galaxies with neighbours closer than this angular distance in one single observation .",
    "the problem is alleviated in sectors covered by multiple exposures but , in general , it is impossible to observe all the objects in crowded regions .    cdm model obtained by combining the information from the shape of the correlation function and cmb measurements ( see section [ ssec : lcdm ] ) .",

    ", we increase by one the value of @xmath52 of the nearest galaxy with a good redshift measurement .",
    "similarly , for each galaxy whose redshift was not observed due to fibre collisions , the value of @xmath53 of its neighbour , closer than 62@xmath48 , is increased by one .",
    "these are then combined into a single weight to correct for missing redshifts given by @xmath55 on the scales analysed in this paper , the application of these weights effectively corrects for the effects of fibre collisions and redshift failures providing an excellent agreement with the results obtained using the method recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed analysis of the systematic effects that could potentially affect any clustering measurement based on the cmass sample showing that , besides redshift failures and fibre collisions , other important corrections must be considered in order to obtain unbiased clustering measurements .",
    "they found that the local stellar density is the dominant source of systematic errors as it has a significant effect on the probability of detecting a cmass galaxy . in this way",
    ", the variations of stellar density across the sky introduce spurious fluctuations in the galaxy density field which affect all clustering measurements .",
    "@xcite found that this systematic effect can be corrected for by applying a set of weights @xmath56 which depend on both the stellar density and the galaxy @xmath57 magnitude , that is , the @xmath58-band magnitude measured within a 2@xmath48 aperture .",
    "we include these weights in the final total weight @xmath59 used in all our clustering measurements @xmath60    additional potential systematics such as galactic extinction , seeing , airmass , and sky background have also been investigated , and all have been found to potentially introduce much smaller spurious fluctuations .",
    "these non - cosmological fluctuations can be corrected for using a weighting scheme that minimises these fluctuations as a function of a given systematic effect .",

    "the bao peak can be seen more clearly in the lower panel , which shows the same measurement rescaled by the ratio @xmath49 , where @xmath61 corresponds to the sound horizon scale in our fiducial cosmology . as will be discussed in more detail in section  [ ssec : northsouth ] , the measurements of the two - point correlation function in the ngc and sgc sub - samples exhibit intriguing differences .",
    "although the overall shapes of these measurements are similar , they show differences at the scale of the acoustic peak . in section  [ ssec : northsouth ]",
    "we discuss the significance of these differences and their impact on the inferred cosmological constraints .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the covariance matrix of the correlation function measured in these samples , we use a set of @xmath62 independent mock catalogues based on a method similar to pthalos @xcite , although with some important differences .",
    "a detailed description of the construction of these mock catalogues and a comparison with the results of n - body simulations is presented in @xcite .",
    "these simulations correspond to the same fiducial cosmology used to measure @xmath22 in the real catalogue and were designed to follow the selection function of the ngc and sgc cmass sub - samples .",
    "we measured the correlation function of each mock catalogue using the same binning schemes as for the real data and the radial weights of equation  ( [ eq : wradial ] ) .",
    "we then use these measurements to obtain an estimate of the covariance matrix of @xmath22 in the ngc , sgc as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the correlation function from the @xmath65-th mock catalogue , and @xmath66 is the mean correlation correlation function from the ensemble of realizations . as in @xcite ,",

    "the errorbars in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] correspond to the square root of the diagonal entries in @xmath68 .",
    "as described in section  [ ssec : info ] , the two - point correlation function contains valuable cosmological information .",
    "however , it is not possible to constrain high - dimensional parameter spaces to high precision using this measurement alone .",
    "here we describe the additional datasets with which we combine the cmass @xmath22 in order to improve the obtained cosmological constraints .    undoubtedly , the measurements of the temperature and polarization fluctuations of the cmb constitute the most powerful and robust cosmological probe to date . in particular , the results from the seven - year of observations of the wmap satellite @xcite and the south pole telescope ( spt , * ?",
    "* ) provide a detailed picture of the structure of the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum up to multipoles @xmath69 .",
    "this information places tight constraints on the parameters of the basic @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however , the power of these observations is limited by nearly exact degeneracies that arise when deviations from this simple model are explored @xcite . these degeneracies can be broken by combining the cmb information with additional datasets , such as the shape of @xmath22 .",

    "is dominated by primary anisotropies , at smaller angular scales it contains a non - negligible contribution from secondary anisotropies . to take this into account",
    ", we follow the treatment of @xcite and include the contributions from the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , and the emission from foreground galaxies ( considering both a clustered and a poisson point source contribution ) in the form of templates whose amplitudes are considered as nuisance parameters and marginalized over .",
    "these templates are only applied to the spt data .",
    "we refer to the wmap - spt combination as our `` cmb '' dataset .    additionally , we consider the constraints provided by the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sn ) obtained from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "this sample contains 472 sn , combining the high - redshift sn from the first three years of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) with other samples , primarily at lower redshifts . in order to take into account the effect of the systematic errors in our cosmological constraints we follow the recipe of @xcite , who performed a detailed analysis of all identified systematic uncertainties , characterizing them in terms of a covariance matrix that incorporates effects such as the recently discovered correlations between sn luminosity and host galaxy properties , as well as the uncertainties of the empirical light - curve models .",
    "when only sn data are used to constrain cosmological parameters , the uncertainty budget is dominated by statistical errors . however , when these data are combined with external datasets , as in our case , statistical and systematic uncertainties are comparable , highlighting the importance of an accurate treatment of the later .",
    "we also use information from other clustering measurements in the form of constraints on @xmath74 and @xmath75 from independent bao analyses .",
