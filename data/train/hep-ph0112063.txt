    "in the standard model ( sm ) , flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are forbidden at tree level .",
    "they can occur starting at one loop . for the @xmath2 transitions",
    ", the diagrams involving the top quark dominate the short distance rate .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of non - decoupling in spontaneously broken gauge theories : heavy fermions in the loops give contributions that do not vanish as the mass increases but rather grow .",
    "thus , fcnc processes at relatively low energies have the potential to explore high energy scales such as the weak scale or even beyond",
    ". extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry , technicolor , etc . would result in new contributions to fcnc loops , leading to deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "this sensitivity of fcnc processes to high energy scales , and therefore to new physics makes them of great interest .",
    "this is particularly true in @xmath3 decays since it is possible that the third generation is involved in electroweak symmetry breaking . however ,  @xmath3 decays are affected by hadronic uncertainties that may obscure the interesting short distance processes .",
    "such uncertainties result from the fact that hadronization is a non - perturbative problem only tractable from first principles by lattice gauge theory .",
    "the use of inclusive decay modes greatly circumvent this problems . there , the uncertainties are mostly not from hadronization ( only relevant in the initial state ) but from perturbative qcd .",
    "exclusive modes , on the other hand , are largely affected by theoretical uncertainties from hadronic matrix elements of the short distance operators .",
    "while lattice calculations progress toward greater precision and accuracy , we can ask the question : can rare @xmath3 decays be used as tests of the one - loop structure of the sm with our current knowledge of hadronic matrix elements ?",
    "the comparison with the program of electroweak precision measurements , mostly performed at the @xmath4 pole , is interesting .",
    "that program relied on processes with large tree - level sm amplitudes ( large sm background ) , but exquisite experimental precision made it possible to achieve sensitivity to one loop contributions since the accuracy of our theoretical knowledge matches this precision .",
    "on the other hand , rare @xmath3 decays and fcnc processes in general , start at one loop but are affected by large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "these considerations are still valid even if we are talking about new physics entering at tree level .",
    "very large data samples of @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays will be available soon .",
    "how good a test of the sm will these be ?",
    "the inclusive @xmath7 decay already constrains physics beyond the sm .",
    "even more constraints will result once @xmath6 modes begin to be measured .",
    "inclusive modes are theoretically cleaner .",
    "the uncertainties are , in principle , from perturbative qcd and the ope for heavy quarks . in practice",
    ", there is the added problem that cuts are needed to make contact with experiment  @xcite .",
    "this introduces additional uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the experimental signals require a very clean environment .",
    "exclusive decays are easier experimentally .",
    "but , as e mentioned earlier , they are affected by large hadronic uncertainties coming as unknown form - factors .",
    "these are the kinds of things the lattice will one day compute precisely .",
    "but for now ( short of using models ) we have to rely on symmetries and other related tricks in order to extract the short distance physics from these modes .",
    "the factorization of short and long distance physics takes place in the effective hamiltonian at low energies .",
    "this is obtained by integrating out the heavy fields ( e.g. the @xmath8 , the top quark , the gluino , etc . ) and has the form @xmath9 here , the basis @xmath10 constitute a complete set of operators leading to @xmath2 transitions , whereas the wilson coefficient functions @xmath11 encode the short distance information coming from integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance in the sm the @xmath11 come from loop integrals involving the @xmath8 and the top quark and they will depend on their masses . if physics beyond the sm contributes to these decays it will shift the values of the wilson coefficients with terms now depending on gluino , squark or technipion masses .",
    "the @xmath12 dependence of the wilson coefficients is in principle canceled by that of the matrix elements of the operators . at leading order in @xmath13",
    "the operators mediating @xmath2 transitions are @xmath14 among these , only @xmath15 contributes to processes with the photon on - shell , such as @xmath5 .",
    "mixing with other operators occurs due to the strong interactions .",
    "most notably with the gluonic dipole operator @xmath16 , and especially with @xmath17 , which is generated by tree - level @xmath8 exchange .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements can be parametrized in terms of form - factors . for the @xmath18 decay",
    "the hadronic matrix elements of the operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 unknown functions of @xmath25 . in the su(3 ) limit @xmath26 in ( [ bp_sem ] ) are the same as the form - factors entering in the semileptonic decay @xmath27 . for @xmath28 decays of the `` semileptonic '' matrix elements over vector and axial vector currents",

    "these form - factors also describe @xmath35 , as well as @xmath36 decays .",
    "the form - factors defined in eqns.([bp_sem])-([sig2kst ] ) are not calculable in a controlled approximation with the notable exception of lattice gauge theory .",
    "we will see however , that symmetries and generally the behavior of hadrons in certain limits will allow us to gain important insight on these quantities .",
    "notice that @xmath37 and @xmath38 does not contribute to the amplitude to the radiative decay into an on - shell photon , i.e. in @xmath1 .",

    "these relations imply , for instance , that the @xmath35 and @xmath45 are described by the same form - factors . additionally , if @xmath34 symmetry is assumed , these also are the @xmath40 form - factors .",
    "we now consider the large energy limit ( lel )  @xcite for heavy - to - light transitions into a vector meson as the ones we are studying . as a result , one recovers the hqss form - factor relations ( [ rel_3 ] ) , but now there are additional new relations among the form - factors defined in ( [ vcurr]-[sig2kst ] ) .",
    "these read as  @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47 and will receive corrections that roughly go as @xmath48 .",
    "it is apparent from eqns .",
    "( [ le4])-([t3 ] ) that , in the lel regime , the @xmath49 decays are described by only two form - factors : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , instead of the seven apriori independent functions in the general lorentz invariant ansatz of the matrix elements . here ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are functions of the heavy mass @xmath52 and the hadronic energy @xmath53 , and refer to the transverse and longitudinal polarizations , respectively .",
    "this simplification leads to new relations among the form - factors .",
    "for instance , the ratio of the vector form - factor @xmath54 to the axial - vector form - factor @xmath55 , @xmath56 is independent of any of these unknown , non - perturbative functions @xmath57 and is determined by purely kinematical factors . here",
    ", @xmath58 denotes the energy of the final light vector meson .",
    "a similar relation holds for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , since they both are also proportional to the `` transverse '' form - factor @xmath50 .",
    "as we will see below , these predictions have important consequences for observables at large recoil energies ( low @xmath61 ) .",
    "these corrections result from the exchange of hard gluons .",
    "there are two kinds of them : factorizable and non - factorizable gluon exchange .",
    "the first kind corresponds to either the renormalization of the heavy - light currents which already appears in ref .",
    "@xcite , or hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark .",
    "the latter can be computed in the brodsky - lepage formalism for exclusive processes at large momentum transfers  @xcite .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that the form - factor relations in ( [ le4])-([t3 ] ) receive @xmath13 corrections that are typically @xmath62 or smaller .",
    "an interesting case is the ratio of vector to axial - vector form - factors in eqn .",
    "( [ rv ] ) , which receives _ no @xmath13 corrections _ to leading order in the @xmath63 expansion .",
    "this has an interesting explanation and we will come back to this point below .",
    "the second kind of hard gluon corrections are the so called non - factorizable ones  @xcite .",
    "these are mediated by diagrams where the gluon exchanged with the spectator comes from either the insertion of the operator @xmath64 , or from the insertion of four - fermion operators @xmath65 with the gluon attached to the quark loop .",
    "these corrections can not be absorbed by form - factors or renormalization of the currents .",
    "thus they are genuinely distinct hard corrections that do not occur in inclusive decays . in refs .",
    "@xcite the effects of all these contributions are computed and are rather large in @xmath1 .",
    "the effective `` exclusive '' wilson coefficient @xmath66 is shifted by roughly @xmath67 , whereas the effect in @xmath68 is smaller .",
    "the authors go on to compute the exclusive rate by making use of light - cone qcd sum rules for the form - factors , resulting in a rate which is approximately a factor of two larger than the experimental rate .",
    "this may be signaling a problem with the form - factor calculation rather than one with the non - factorizable hard gluons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an effective field theory including collinear quarks and gluons is developed .",
    "this theory includes leet but , unlike leet , it has the correct infrared behavior .",
    "sudakov logarithms are accounted for in this treatment . concerning its application to exclusive decays",
    ", this `` complete '' leet does not modify the form - factor relations implied by eqns.([le4]-[t3 ] ) .",
    "a main ingredient of leet is preserved when the interaction with collinear gluons is taken into account : energetic quarks still are two component spinors in the lel .",
    "thus the complete leet including collinear gluons confirms that the leet relations are valid in the large energy limit of qcd .",
    "just as in hqet the @xmath69 corrections are potentially a very important source of uncertainty , the lel predictions are affected by @xmath63 corrections . unlike in hqet , it is not clear that leet is a framework where the @xmath63 corrections can be estimated .",
    "even when collinear gluons are incorporated , it is difficult to separate degrees of freedom to be integrated out so that an effective field theory can emerge . perhaps , we can still estimate the size of these corrections with this caveat in mind .",
    "more work is needed , and certainly once experimental tests of leet predictions become available we hope to understand more about them .      the forward - backward asymmetry for leptons as a function of the dilepton mass squared @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the angle between the @xmath74 and the @xmath75 in the dilepton center - of - mass frame . is defined with respect to @xmath76 .",
    "but the expressions there correspond to the current definition .",
    "this explains the sign difference with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "the asymmetry is proportional to the wilson coefficient @xmath77 and vanishes with it .",
    "furthermore , it is proportional to a combination of @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that it has a zero in the physical region if the following condition is satisfied  @xcite @xmath80=\\frac{m_b}{q^2_0}\\,c_7^{\\rm eff.}\\,\\left\\ { \\frac{t_1}{v}(m_b+m_{k^ * } ) -   ( m_b - m_{k^*})\\,\\frac{t_2}{a_1}\\right\\}~,\\label{afbz}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the position of the @xmath82 zero and all @xmath61-dependent quantities ) with respect to a similar expression in ref.@xcite is due to a sign in the definition of @xmath54 . ]",

    "the zero of the asymmetry implies the relation : @xmath84=-2 ( m_b^2/q_0 ^ 2)\\,c_7^{\\rm eff.}$ ] .",
    "thus , in principle the condition in ( [ afbz ] ) is affected by the presence of the hadronic form - factors making it a priori a more uncertain relation . however , by making use of the hqss relations ( [ rel_3 ] ) for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the form - factor eqn .",

    "thus , the determination of the zero of @xmath90 in @xmath40 gives a relation between the short distance wilson coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 where the only uncertainty from form - factors is in the ratio @xmath88 . as mentioned earlier , since ( [ con2 ] ) was derived using the heavy quark _ spin _",
    "symmetry , it is expected to receive small corrections . in principle , information on @xmath91 could be extracted from the @xmath35 decay .",
    "but it turns out that this may not be necessary .",
    "if we plot the asymmetry vs. the dilepton mass in a variety of models we note that the asymmetry is agreed upon with exceptional accuracy ! in ref.@xcite it was noted that        this feature must emerge from a `` factorization '' of the soft physics in such a way that @xmath92 so that the soft physics cancels in the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "it was first recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is precisely what the leet predicts : @xmath93 as extracted from eqns .",
    "( [ le4 ] ) and ( [ le5 ] ) . then",

    "the hard gluon corrections discussed above would shift the position of the zero by a calculable amount given in ref.@xcite .",
    "there it is pointed out that non - factorizable contributions change the value of @xmath81 from what it would be obtained if the `` inclusive '' wilson coefficients are used by an amount around @xmath94 . this is roughly @xmath95 .",
    "the plot in fig.[afb ] takes all these corrections into account .",
    "we finally discuss another application of leet . in ref .",
    "@xcite the leet prediction for @xmath88 in eqn.([rv ] ) was used in combination with the @xmath1 and @xmath7 data , and heavy quark spin symmetry in order to constrain the semileptonic form - factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath96 . here",
    "we update this analysis by incorporating the factorizable and non - factorizable hard corrections from refs.@xcite .",
    "since the nlo corrections in the exclusive mode are not canceled by the ones in the inclusive decay , we will not normalize the exclusive branching ratio to the inclusive one .",
    "instead we make use of the exclusive data only in order to extract the @xmath1 form - factor .",
    "the branching ratio reads @xmath97 where the form - factor @xmath85 was defined in ( [ sig2kst ] ) , and @xmath98 is the nlo effective wilson coefficient for the exclusive mode , which differs from the one entering in inclusive decays .",
    "we use the running mass @xmath99gev , and @xmath100 .",
    "the value of @xmath98 was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath101 .",
    "we make use of the world average for the neutral mode  @xcite @xmath102 .",
    "we obtain @xmath103 , where the error mainly reflects the experimental uncertainty , the uncertainty in the @xmath104 quark mass and the scale dependence in @xmath98 .",
    "this result assumes the sm for the calculation of the short distance coefficient @xmath98 . however , this is not a very strong assumption given that the agreement of the inclusive calculation with the @xmath7 , and the fact that the new physics is likely to affect this rate and the exclusive one similarly .",
    "armed with this extracted value of @xmath105 , now we can go to the hqss relations and turn them into a relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is @xmath108 eqn .",
    "( [ expconst ] ) results in a constraint in the @xmath109 plane , which in fig .",
    "[ fitcon ] corresponds to the band descending from left to right . in addition",
    ", the expression ( [ rv ] ) for @xmath88 gives another constraint corresponding to a straight line going through the origin .",
    "this leet prediction will surely receive corrections at next to leading order in the @xmath63 and @xmath110 expansions .",
    "these corrections have not been computed and we simply guess they are of order @xmath111 , giving the cone in fig .",
    "[ fitcon ] .",
    "we should notice , however , that the leet prediction for @xmath88 does not receive hard gluon or collinear gluon corrections .",
    "we will come back to this point .",

    "@xcite where the nlo corrections had not been taken into account .",

    "[ fitcon ] , in lower values for both @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "also , here we use the most recent average of the neutral mode resulting in a thinner band than the one in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we compare our findings for @xmath106 and @xmath107 with several model predictions . for illustration",

    "@xcite ( diagonal cross ) and the prediction by ligeti and wise ( lw ) from ref.@xcite ( square ) . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fitcon ] , the latter is even more excluded now . as discussed in more detail in ref.@xcite ,",
    "this is likely to be due largely to the use of a monopole form - factor to extrapolate from the charm data to the maximum recoil in a @xmath3 decay .",
    "corrections to the heavy quark flavor symmetry , although large , are unlikely to be the sole explanation for such a discrepancy .",
    "a new finding in this update is the apparent exclusion of the ms and lcsr predictions for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these models , were in agreement with the fit in ref .",
    "of course , this exclusion refers to the predicted central values for the models . in some cases the predictions have large errors and modifications in the calculations",
    "may bring them into agreement with the fit .",
    "a potentially large isospin violation splitting the neutral and charged modes was found in ref.@xcite in the context of qcd factorization .",
    "this would shift the value of @xmath98 in the neutral mode by a few percent , resulting in a similarly small shift in the value of @xmath105 extracted from eqn.([rgamma ] ) .    finally , we comment on the leading order leet prediction for @xmath88 , eqn .",

    "thus , we see from the form of @xmath88 in the large energy limit , that the `` @xmath119 '' helicity vanishes @xmath120 in the lel regime , up to residual terms of order @xmath121 .",

    "quark models tend to have this concept built in , which explains the agreement on the position of the zero in fig .",
    "this is also the reason why @xmath13 corrections from hard gluon exchange between the spectator quark and the fast light quark do not affect eqn .",
