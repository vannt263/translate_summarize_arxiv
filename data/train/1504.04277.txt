    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent one of the final phases in the evolution of stars with masses @xmath0 m@xmath1 , when they become hot enough to photoionize the circumstellar envelope ejected during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "this nebular photoionization proceeds very quickly , over only a few decades @xcite , making it extremely difficult to study the events produced just at the transition to the pn phase , which are crucial to determine how pne form .",
    "many pne exhibit complex axisymmetric or multipolar morphologies that are believed to be caused by collimated jets @xcite launched during the post - agb ( which just precedes the photoionization of the envelope ) and pn phases .",
    "the exact mechanism for the launching of these jets is still unknown , but possible scenarios are the presence of magnetic fields @xcite and/or binary systems @xcite .",
    "the combination of jets and magnetic fields lead to the presence of synchrotron radiation in several astrophysical contexts , such as active galactic nuclei @xcite , microquasars @xcite , or massive protostars @xcite .",
    "this emission is caused by the motion within a magnetic field of electrons accelerated to relativistic velocities at shock fronts induced by jets @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields have been detected in the circumstellar envelopes of some pne @xcite , but synchrotron emission has never been unambiguously reported in pne before ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of previous attempts for such a detection ) , even though the energy conditions in pne are well - suited for the production of synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the strong free - free radiation from ionized gas that characterize these objects is expected to overwhelm any type of non - thermal emission .",
    "@xcite claimed that synchrotron emission is a possible source of centimeter - wave excess in the radio continuum flux of some pne , over what would be expected from free - free emission alone , but the available data could not confirm this hypothesis . on the other hand",
    ", non - thermal emission has been observed in a few post - agb sources @xcite , where photoionization has not yet started but jets are already present .",
    "all this indicates that the temporal window for a possible study of synchrotron radiation in pne is extremely short , since it can not be detected very shortly after the onset of photoionization .",
    "the source iras 15103@xmath25457 ( hereafter i15103 ) is an optically obscured pn showing a high - velocity jet traced by water masers @xcite .",
    "water maser jets are seen in a few late agb and post - agb stars , and are termed `` water fountains '' @xcite .",
    "i15103 is the first known case of a `` water fountain '' that has already entered the pn phase , suggesting that it may be one of the youngest pn known .",
    "therefore , it is an excellent candidate to study the processes taking place during the transition into this phase .",
    "moreover , interferometric radio continuum observations obtained in the red msx survey ( rms , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a flux density lower at 3.6 cm than at 6 cm @xcite , which suggests the emission may be non - thermal .",
    "a confirmation of this trend was needed , since only two wavelengths were observed in this survey , and problems such as calibration uncertainties or extended flux missed by the interferometer may have affected these values of flux density .    in order to confirm the presence of non thermal emission in i15103 , we present new radio continuum observations covering a much wider range of wavelengths in different epochs . in section 2",

    "table [ table_observations ] summarizes the different frequencies and array configuration used .",
    "all observations used the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) , which provides two independent intermediate frequency ( if ) outputs of 2 ghz in dual linear polarization . in the particular case of observations around 2.1 ghz , both",
    "if were centered at the same frequency , since each if covers the whole frequency band of the receiver ( to provide redundancy in case of correlator failure ) , so we only processed one of them .",
    "the observations on august 2011 used the 64 m mode of cabb , which samples each 2 ghz bandpass into 32 frequency channels of 64 mhz .",

    "our radio continuum observations show a dependency of flux density @xmath12 as a function of frequency that is atypical for a pn .",
    "radio continuum emission from pne normally consists in free - free ( bremsstrahlung ) radiation in the ionized gas , and follows a relation with frequency @xmath13 , where the spectral index @xmath14 ranges from @xmath15 in the optically thick regime at low frequencies ( usually @xmath16 10  ghz ) , to @xmath17 for optically thin emission at high frequencies ( usually @xmath18 10  ghz ) . the turnover frequency separating these two opacity regimes",
    "is thought to depend on the age of the pn @xcite .",
    "however , our data taken in the first two sets of observations ( 2010 - 2011 ; black and green solid lines and black filled circles ) show radio continuum emission with a steep decline at high frequencies ( figure [ fig_observations ] ) .",
    "we found a spectral index @xmath19 between 8 and 25 ghz , indicating a non - thermal origin for the emission .",
    "the data at higher frequencies ( 42 - 46 ghz ) show an apparently steeper spectral index , but given that it is obtained from only two points , its significance is low ( @xmath20 ) . at lower frequencies ( 4 - 5.5 ghz ) ,",
    "the data have lower quality , with artifacts in the maps that may indicate the presence of low - level rfi , as explained above , so the possible turnover suggested by the data at these frequencies is not reliable .",
    "our most recent atca data ( october - december 2012 ) , taken about one year later , show a significantly flatter spectrum over the whole range from 1 to 24 ghz .",
    "in particular , the data taken on october 2012 ( blue solid lines in fig . [ fig_observations ] ) follow a spectral index of @xmath21 between 4.5 and 25 ghz .",
    "the slope is similar for data taken on december 2012 between 1 and 10 ghz ( orange solid lines in fig .",

    "the data taken on december 2012 allow us to resolve some structure in the radio continuum emission .",
    "figure [ fig_map ] ( top ) shows a map of the emission integrated between 8 and 10 ghz .",
    "the emission is dominated by an unresolved intense core , but there is much weaker emission extending along three arms toward the northeast , southwest , and southeast .",
    "note that the contour levels in this map are not linear , but proportional to powers of 2 , and the highest level nearly corresponds to the half power level .",
    "figure [ fig_map ] ( bottom ) shows a spectral index map obtained with the emission between 8 and 10 ghz ( map in fig .",
    "[ fig_map]-top ) , and the radio continuum emission between 4.5 and 6.5 ghz , both convolved to a common angular resolution of @xmath22 . as expected in view of the sed ,",
    "most of the emission is non - thermal ( with @xmath23 ) , including the central bright core .",
    "however , there are some areas that are compatible with thermal emission ( @xmath24 ) , specially toward the northeast ( the positive spectral indices toward the southeast are at lower intensity levels and are less reliable ) .",
    "the intensity of this possible thermal emission is more than 50 times weaker than the non - thermal peak , and it does not significantly affect the derived spectral index from fig .",
    "[ fig_observations ] .",
    "the time evolution of flux density derived from archival observations is also consistent with the emission becoming weaker with time , a variation that seems to be dramatic at low frequencies .",
    "the only exception to this historical weakening is the data from the magmo project , taken in 2012 , and optimized for spectral line work .",
    "the magmo data suggest a turnover , and a slightly lower flux density than our observations at these frequencies , which were taken later .",
    "however , we consider these flux densities less reliable , given the relatively large distance of the source from the phase center of the observations , and the use of a different primary flux calibrator : pks 0823 - 500 instead of pks 1934 - 638 in our data .",
    "as noted above , the flux density model of pks 0823 - 500 in miriad might be incorrect , and so the combination of positional offset and calibrator flux density error margin reduce the significance of any differences .",
    "apart from the flux density scale , the flux density of the magmo data also shows an apparent turnover around 1.7 ghz .",
    "an incorrect spectral index in the model of pks 0823 - 500 could produce such an effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the turnover could be real , but it would have to be a very short - lived phenomenon , since we did not see it in our observations in december 2012 , not even a year after the magmo ones .",
    "the unconfirmed result makes it difficult to ascertain the reliability of the possible turnover .    in any case , the global flattening of the flux density as a function of frequency , which we see in our observations in a timescale of 1 - 2 years ( fig .",
    "[ fig_observations ] ) is a robust result , since the same slope is seen in three different frequency ranges , observed independently .",
    "several scenarios are possible for the origin and variations of the thermal and non - thermal radio continuum emission detected at i15103 . we describe in the following the different hypothesis and their implication in the global context of stellar evolution .",
    "the weak emission detected on the radio continuum map with spectral indices @xmath25 ( fig .  [ fig_map ] ) is compatible with the typical free - free emission from ionized gas in pne .",
    "it could represent photoionized gas extending toward the northeast lobe of the mid - ir nebulosity @xcite , in the direction of the water maser jet @xcite . the overall emission in the source , however , is strongly dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "a very striking characteristic of the radio emission in i15103 is that it mostly shows negative spectral indices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_map ] ) , which indicates that it is dominated by non - thermal processes .",
    "this emission should arise from electrons moving in a magnetized medium .",
    "in particular , the spectral index @xmath26 found between 8 and 25 ghz in 2010 - 2011 is consistent with either synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , or gyrosynchrotron from mildly relativistic ones .",
    "the spectral index both in the case of synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron emission depends on the power - law energy distribution of electrons ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , a change in spectral index , as observed between 2010 and 2012 , could indicate a time variation in this energy distribution that can be used to discern which processes are at work .",
    "alternatively , it could be the result of absorption or suppression processes that are stronger on radiation at lower frequencies .",
    "we will discuss these possibilities in the following .",
    "the spectral index @xmath19 is similar to that found in synchrotron emission in galaxies with active nuclei @xcite . in the case of pure synchrotron emission",
    ", the spectral index can be related to the energy distribution of electrons , in the form @xmath28 . in our case ,",
    "the observed @xmath14 would imply a value of @xmath29 . in the energy conditions of pne ,",
    "mass - loss processes can produce collisionless , non - relativistic shocks and electrons may undergo diffusive shock acceleration @xcite up to very high velocities ( this process is also called `` first - order fermi acceleration '' ) . in this case",
    ", the exponent of the energy distribution of electrons is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the compression ratio of the gas at the shock .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath31 in an ideal , non - relativistic gas is @xmath32 .",
    "the value @xmath33 we obtained indicates that @xmath31 is close to this maximum value .    in the case of the data taken on october 2012 , the spectral index of @xmath34 found between 4.5 and 25 ghz would imply an index for the energy distribution of electrons , @xmath35 if the emission were due to synchrotron emission .",
    "however , since the maximum compression ratio in collisionless shocks is @xmath36 , diffusive shock acceleration can not explain indices @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the spectral index in the pure synchrotron regime should always be @xmath38 , while the acceleration is taking place .    however , the synchrotron emission could be the result of a shock that took place during a short time and electrons are not being accelerated any longer . in that case , the observed spectral flattening reflects the evolution of electron energy after the shock ended .",
    "we note that i15103 is a pn @xcite , and it has developed a photoionized region around it .",
    "when the relativistic electrons move in a dense plasma , they lose energy due to coulomb collisions against ions .",
    "the lifetime of electrons of lower energy is shorter under coulomb losses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath39\\right)^{-1 } { \\rm s } , \\label{eq_timescale}\\ ] ] were @xmath40 is the electron density of the plasma expressed in @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the result is a progressive hardening of the energy distribution , with less electrons of low energy .",
    "this will lead to a flattening of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "spectral flattening due to coulomb collisions is also observed in the radio spectrum of solar flares @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of electrons under coulomb collisions are consistent with the observed flattening of i15013 over time .",
    "in particular , assuming a magnetic field of @xmath43 mg , as seen in some post - agb stars @xcite , according to @xcite , the larmor frequency of electrons @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath47 is the magnetic field strength ) would be @xmath48 khz .",
    "thus , the synchrotron emission at @xmath49 ghz would typically be due to electrons with @xmath50 .",
    "equation [ eq_timescale ] indicates that the lifetime of these electrons under coulomb collisions and assuming electron density of @xmath51 @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be @xmath53 yr .",
    "this is a reasonable value considering the timescales of variations at low frequency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_observations ] . under this interpretation ,",
    "the observed non - thermal emission in i15103 would be due to synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated during an explosive event that occurred a few years ago , and the emission would now be decaying due to coulomb losses .",
    "we note that a recent explosive event would also explain the velocity gradient of the maser emission in this source @xcite , which reinforces this interpretation .",
    "we also note that the timescale of relativistic electrons will shorten with increasing plasma density ( equation [ eq_timescale ] ) .",
    "the change in spectral index between 2010 and 2012 seems particularly sudden compared with the evolution in previous years .",
    "this is suggestive of an increasing density of ionized gas , consistent with i15103 being a very young pn that is developing its photoionized region .",
    "an alternative explanation to the observed change in the sed of i15103 would be that we witness the variation in gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic electrons .",
    "this radiative process is seen in active stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flux density of these stars roughly follows a power - law of the form @xmath54^\\alpha , \\label{eq_gyro}\\ ] ] where the relation between the spectral index and the distribution of electrons is given by @xmath55 @xcite , @xmath56 is the pitch angle between the electron trajectory and the magnetic field , and @xmath57 is the electron - cyclotron frequency .    equation ( 4 ) does not take into account any effect from the thermal plasma , and gyrosynchrotron emission will in general deviate from a simple power law ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it serves to illustrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the case of i15103 .    as in the previous hypothesis",
    ", the change in spectral index would imply a change in the energy distribution of electrons , and all spectral indices observed in i15103 are in principle possible . considering that the flux density has not changed much at 23 ghz between 2010 and 2013 ,",
    "equation [ eq_gyro ] implies that magnetic fields of several kg are necessary to flatten the radio spectrum while maintaining a similar flux density at 23 ghz .",
    "these magnetic field strengths have not been observed in pne @xcite , which makes this hypothesis highly unreliable .",
    "we have also explored the possibility that the change in the spectral index were not due to a variation in the electron distribution , but to selective absorption / suppression of radiation at low frequencies .",
    "if the emission on 2010 - 2011 is of gyrosynchrotron / synchrotron nature , this can be later suppressed by an increasing amount of ionized gas via two possible processes : a ) opacity from free electrons or b ) the razin ( or razin - tsytovich ) effect @xcite . both processes are more efficient at lower frequencies .    in the former case ( a ) , the opacity due to free electrons has a dependency @xmath58 .",
    "we tested this possibility against our data , assuming a screen of ionized material between the observer and the source of non - thermal emission , and applying an optical depth @xmath59 to a sed with spectral index @xmath60 , varying the constant @xmath61 until we reached a final spectral index of @xmath62 between 8 and 23 ghz .",
    "however , the resulting screen of ionized gas would have such a high opacity at lower frequencies that we should not detect any emission at @xmath63 ghz ( fig . [ fig_opacity ] ) . moreover , an optically thick screen of free electrons would produce thermal free - free emission with a flux density proportional to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the solid angle subtended by the screen . given the frequency dependence of free - free emission , it can not compensate the deficit of emission at 1 - 2 ghz since , in that case , thermal emission would dominate at even higher frequencies , with a positive spectral index that is not observed .    in the case of razin effect ( b ) , the shape of the spectral energy distribution of synchrotron emission within a plasma takes the form    @xmath66    ( function p in equation [ razin_eq ] in * ? ? ?",
    "* but with some changes in the nomenclature of variables ) , where    @xmath67    @xmath68    the function @xmath69 is defined as    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the bessel function of order 5/3 .    the key parameter is the ratio @xmath72 , which controls the change in spectral slope . assuming @xmath73 , the critical frequency below which the synchrotron emission is mostly suppressed is @xmath74 .",
    "applying equation [ razin_eq ] to a sed with spectral index @xmath60 , to reach a final spectral index of @xmath75 between 8 and 23 ghz , would also imply the complete suppression of emission at low frequency , as in the case of plasma opacity ( a ) , ruling out these two hypothesis .",
    "a possible explanation for the observed change in spectral index is the behavior predicted by @xcite for non - thermal emission within dense plasmas when the magnetic field has both an ordered and a random component .",
    "we note that the spectral index @xmath76 observed in 2012 is similar to that in the crab nebula @xcite and other pulsar wind nebulae @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the emission can be interpreted as `` jitter '' ( or `` diffusive synchrotron '' ) radiation @xcite , i.e. , electrons moving in a random magnetic field , as opposed to the ordered field for usual synchrotron emission .",
    "if we consider i15103 as having both an ordered and a random component , where the ordered component dominates , relativistic electrons moving along the magnetic field lines would mainly show a normal synchrotron emission , with a relatively small contribution of jitter emission .",
    "however , if this magnetic field is embedded in a plasma , the razin effect would suppress the synchrotron component .",
    "the suppression of jitter emission depends much more slowly on plasma density ( equation 40 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore , if this density is sufficiently high , the jitter emission will eventually dominate the entire spectrum even though the magnetic field and the electron energetics remained unchanged .",
    "the razin effect is actually stronger in the presence of dense plasmas and relatively weak magnetic fields , so we expect it to be more readily detectable under the physical conditions of pne , over those in other synchrotron - emitting objects , such as radio galaxies or supernovae .    in this scenario , and for the case of i15103 , until 2010 , while the photoionization of the pn was still low , it would show a mixture of synchrotron and jitter emission ( consistent with a magnetic field with an ordered and a turbulent component ) .",
    "the increasing plasma density of the newly formed ionized region of the pn would then suppress the synchrotron component due to razin effect .",
    "the final result would be pure jitter emission in the 2012 data .",
    "if the change in the spectral slope is due to a sudden change in the dominant radio continuum emission mechanism , it would suggest that we are witnessing the onset of the photoionization in a pn .",
    "however , given that we do not have a direct determination of the magnetic field strength , the plasma density , and the size of the non - thermal emitting region , it is not possible at this point to determine whether this interpretation is correct .",
    "it is interesting to compare the flattening in the spectral energy distribution of the radio continuum emission , with the flattening seen in the post - agb star iras 15445@xmath25449 @xcite , whose nature is clearly different from the one we see in i15103 . in iras 15445@xmath25449",
    ", the change in the slope between 2.5 and 22 ghz is due to an increase of flux density at high frequencies .",
    "this was interpreted as an increasingly higher contribution of free - free emission which could arise from a shock - ionized wind .",
    "it is known that a highly collimated ionized wind can produce significant free - free emission @xcite , and a stronger emission at high frequencies could be the consequence of a sudden increase in its mass - loss rate . on the contrary , the flattening we observe in i15103 is due to a decrease of flux density at low frequencies .",
    "the flux density distribution seems to go down , pivoting around @xmath77 ghz , where it does not change much .",
    "this can not be explained by an increase of free - free emission , but strongly indicates a suppression of emission at low frequencies .",
    "other post - agb stars show non - thermal emission @xcite , but there is no information on their time evolution , so a comparison is not possible at this stage .",
    "flat radio spectra with indices @xmath78 have also been found in wolf - rayet stars @xcite , and explained as a combination of thermal and non - thermal emission in colliding wind binaries . under these models ,",
    "the non - thermal component has @xmath79 , and the flattening would be attributed to the thermal mechanism .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we can not explain the progressive flattening of the spectrum in i15103 with an increase of thermal emission .",
    "i15103 is the first known pn in which synchrotron emission could be detected , since the free - free emission is so weak that it has not masked the non - thermal emission yet .",
    "this non - thermal emission due to shocks could share a common origin with that seen in some post - agb stars @xcite .",

    "[ sec_coulomb ] ) , we would be observing the results of a jet launched close to the moment when the post - agb becomes a pn .",
    "theoretical predictions affirm that jets can be launched when magnetic field lines are twisted due to the different rotation speeds of the envelope and the stellar core of an evolved star , and the energy is released in the form of a collimated ejection @xcite .",
    "the conditions for this magnetic explosion will be favoured when a star enters the pn phase , as is the case of i15103 , since the magnetic field lines away from the star will tend to be locked by the ionized gas to the slower rotational motions of the outer envelope .",
    "moreover , recent studies show that magnetic fields are stronger in older post - agb stars and might be related to the origin of non - spherical morphologies in these objects @xcite .",
    "the changes in the spectral index could also be produced by the razin effect ( sec .",
    "[ sec_razin ] ) , where the beginning of photoionization could start new physical processes that affect the behavior of the radio continuum emission .",
    "previous studies of radio continuum in very young pne showed that in several cases @xcite the observed spectral index could not be explained by the classical optically thin free - free emission and the deviations from the expected @xmath14 were in some cases attributed to calibration uncertainties or other instrumental effects .",
    "radio continuum variability as well as negative spectral indices were also found in young pne @xcite , but limited time and frequency coverage prevented a detailed identification of the processes taking place .",
    "in fact , it is possible that some of these young pn may be undergoing the same processes as we are witnessing in i15103 , but it has only been possible to identify them in this study , thanks to the implementation of new broad - band receivers and correlators in radio telescopes such as atca or the jansky very large array .",
    "a monitoring of the radio spectrum of i15103 would shed light on the processes taking place in this unique object . as shown above , possible origins of the variation seen in the spectral index are changes in synchrotron emission due to coulomb collisions ( sec .",
    "[ sec_coulomb ] ) , or selective suppression of part of the emission due to razin effect ( sec .",
    "[ sec_razin ] ) .",
    "however , we expect that these processes would lead to different future evolutions in the short term . in the case of changes in the energy distribution of electrons due to coulomb collisions",
    ", we expect that the spectral flattening will continue",
    ". eventually , a low - frequency cutoff will arise in the spectrum , reflecting a complete suppression of electrons below an energy threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "if the physical process is razin suppression of synchrotron emission , leaving only jitter emission , we do not expect a significant further flattening of the emission , since the dominant radiative process after 2012 should not be immediately affected by the razin effect .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_map ] , the possible contribution of free - free emission from ionized material is still much weaker than the non - thermal emission in this source . in the long term , we predict that free - free radiation will significantly increase in the future , as photoionization proceeds .",
    "its more immediate effects would be an increase of flux densities at high frequencies due to free - free emission , and a decrease at low frequencies due to the absorption of non - thermal emission by the plasma opacity . at later times",
    ", free - free emission will eventually dominate the radio spectrum of the source , giving rise to a thermal sed similar to other young pne @xcite , with no trace of the non - thermal emission that we observe now .",
    "we have observed radio continuum emission between 1 and 46 ghz towards the young pn iras 15103@xmath25754 , in different epochs between 2010 and 2012 , using the australia telescope compact array .",
    "archive radio continuum data from 1991 to 2012 have been used to complete the information on this source .",
    "our main conclusions are as follow :    * radio continuum emission shows a non - thermal spectrum , which is not typical of pne . *",
    "the flux density seems to have decreased with time , especially at the lowest frequencies .",
    "in particular we see a flattening of the spectrum , with a spectral index @xmath80 in 2010 - 2011 , which changed to @xmath81 in 2012 .",
    "while the radio spectrum observed in 2010 - 2011 can be explained as arising from synchrotron emission with electrons accelerated in a shock , the one in 2012 is not compatible with this process alone .",
    "* the variation of the radio spectrum in i15103 can be attributed to two effects of the onset of photoionization in this source : * * the loss of energy of the synchrotron - emitting electrons due to coulomb collisions within the ionized region of the pn .",
    "the estimated lifetime of the electrons is 18 yr , consistent with the timescale of variation of the flux density in the archival data .",
    "the onset of the photoionization could produce the sudden change visible in the spectral index between 2010 and 2012 .",
    "* * the electrons moving in a magnetic field with both an ordered and a random component , which would give rise to a mixture of synchrotron and `` jitter '' emission .",
    "the razin effect would suppress the synchrotron component as photoionization progresses . only the jitter component with a flatter spectral index , will remain .",
    "* we postulate that the flattening of non - thermal spectra could be a signature of the onset of the pn phase .",
