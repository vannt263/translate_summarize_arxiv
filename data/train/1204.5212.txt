    "from the variety of experiments described in this review issue , it is clear that stripes , or stripe - like fluctuations , appear as groundstates or important low - energy configurations in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of impurities or lattice defects , the interplay between randomness and the stripe - like correlations can lead to the electronic inhomogeneity observed in these materials at low doping @xcite .",
    "there have been various theoretical models and explanations for the occurrence of these stripes .",
    "early on , hartree - fock calculations @xcite for the doped hubbard model found that one - dimensional domains of increased hole density forming anti - phase nel boundaries were present in the mean - field solutions . here",
    ", the stability of the stripe structure arose from the reduction in the kinetic energy that the holes experienced in moving transverse to the stripes .",
    "the stripes in this hartree - fock solution were insulating , characterized by a filling of one hole per domain wall unit cell , while experiments on the cuprates found a filling of half this @xcite . an alternate view proposed that stripes could arise from a competition between phase separation and long - range coulomb interactions @xcite . in this",
    " frustrated phase separation \" approach , it was argued that lightly doped @xmath0-@xmath2 and hubbard models would , in the absence of a long - range coulomb interaction , globally phase separate into uniform hole - rich and undoped regions . while there are disagreements regarding whether the simple two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath2 or hubbard models , with parameters in the relevant physical regime , will in fact exhibit phase separation , if phase separation occurs , the formation of stripes in this scenario depends upon the suppression of the phase separation by the long - range coulomb interaction . in this case , the stripes can be metallic . in a third scenario , which we will discuss ,",
    "the formation of stripes in the 2d @xmath0-@xmath2 model is found to involve , in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy of the holes arising from the @xmath3-phase shifted antiferromagnetic stripe correlations , @xmath4-wave pairing correlations leading to half - filled stripes @xcite .    in the following , we will review density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) results for the @xmath0-@xmath2 model .",

    "the nearest - neighbor hopping and exchange interaction are @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively , and the average site occupation @xmath12 is set by the hole doping parameter @xmath13 .",
    "a next - near - neighbor hopping @xmath1 will also be considered . except for cases in which a proximity pairfield is applied , the particle number will be fixed .",

    "the fact that the energy per hole of two holes is lower than that of a single hole indicates that two holes pair in agreement with exact diagonalization studies .",
    "however , we note that the energy per hole associated with the domain wall for @xmath35 is even lower suggesting that pairs condense into domain walls even at low doping . the interaction between domain walls",
    "was also studied and was found to be repulsive .",

    "the ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) walls , as well as the pairs , are nearly degenerate leading to large fluctuations in the configurations @xcite .",

    "since the stripes have broken the @xmath43 rotational symmetry of the lattice , the pairfield - pairfield correlations for @xmath13-link pairs differ from those of the @xmath21-link pairs .",
    "however , the @xmath4-wave - like nature of the pairing correlations is evident in the fact that @xmath44 is found to be negative@xcite .    based on the behavior of the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath2 ladder @xcite , it is natural to expect that the stripes will exhibit pairfield correlations .",
    "for the two - leg ladder , one knows that these correlations have a power law decay and indeed if a sufficient number of states are kept in the dmrg calculations , a power law decay is observed .",
    "however , the off diagonal nature of the pairing correlations makes this one of the more challenging calculations .",

    "fluctuations in which a pair of holes is exchanged between two of the stripes leaving one stripe with 2 holes and another with 6 holes lead to linear hole densities of 0.25 and 0.75 , respectively in the two stripes . from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , one can see that such large deviations of the linear hole density are energetically costly so that pair number fluctuations are suppressed leading in turn to the suppression of the pairfield correlations . in order to study longer stripes which can more readily support density fluctuations , we have considered systems which have slightly anisotropic exchange interactions @xmath46@xcite . as shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig:4]b shows the expectation value of the proximity induced pairfield @xmath58 for @xmath54 and @xmath21 with a coupling strength @xmath59 for the four thickest end links and 0.5 for the four vertical links adjacent to them .",

    "the picture that emerges from these dmrg calculations for the @xmath0-@xmath2 model is that for dopings @xmath36 , ( 1,0 ) domain walls are favored .",
    "these walls have a linear hole filling @xmath76 and repel each other , leading to a domain wall spacing @xmath84 .",

    "the minimum energy filling remains @xmath76 and there are similar @xmath4-wave pairfield correlations .",
    "in general , the stripes tend to occupy more than one column or row so that there is not a sharp distinction between site- and bond - centered stripes , and intermediate centerings are possible .",
    "in this section , we seek to determine the nature of the physics that underlies the properties of the domain walls which have been described in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .    to begin , there is of course the question of phase separation .",

    ".  originally argued that the 2d @xmath0-@xmath2 model phase separates for all @xmath85 interaction strengths close to half filling .",
    "hellberg and manousakis @xcite , using a green s function monte carlo technique , found results that supported this .",
    "however , calandra et al .",
    "@xcite , who also used green s function monte carlo , concluded that phase separation only occured if @xmath86 and putikka @xcite et al . , using a high temperature series expansion , concluded that phase separation for dopings near half - filling required @xmath87 .",
    "the dmrg is known to be most effective for one - dimensional systems and ladder systems of limited width .",
    "therefore , we have studied the phase separation question by examining a sequence of ladders which have an increasing number of legs . for these @xmath88-leg ladders with @xmath88 up to 6 , the dmrg results provide reliable results for the @xmath89 phase separation boundary .    in a @xmath0-@xmath2 ladder with two or more legs ,",
    "the phase - separated system consists of one region containing holes and one region without any holes .",

    "@xcite , the co - doped super - oxygenated la@xmath140sr@xmath141cuo@xmath142 exhibits both a long - range incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase with @xmath143 and a superconducting phase with @xmath144 .",
    "it appears that this material phase separates into two line compounds having different hole densities but with @xmath145k . in la@xmath146cuo@xmath147 , which has interstitial oxygen positioned in every fourth la@xmath146o@xmath146 layer , spin - stripe and bulk superconductivity appear simultaneously at @xmath148k @xcite .",
    "finally , anisotropic transport and magnetization data for la@xmath149ba@xmath150cuo@xmath151 provide evidence that two - dimensional superconducting correlations coexist with the stripe order up to temperatures of order 40k @xcite .",
    "the absence of 3d superconducting order above @xmath152k suggests an antiphase ordering in the superconducting state which could then suppress the interlayer josephson coupling .    as noted , there are models @xcite that can give rise to such intertwined phases and early variational monte carlo calculations @xcite found that for @xmath153 stripe states with antiphase @xmath4-wave superconducting order were in fact stabilized relative to stripes with in - phase superconductivity .",
    "however , both the dmrg calculations that we have discussed and recent renormalized mean - field theory calculations @xcite find that the antiphase @xmath4-wave state is slightly higher in energy than that of the in - phase state .",
    "thus , while it appears that the @xmath0-@xmath154-@xmath2 models provide a good starting point for discussing stripes , there remains more to be understood .",
