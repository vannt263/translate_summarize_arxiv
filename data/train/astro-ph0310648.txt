    "quasars were first found as optical identifications of luminous radio sources .",
    "however , only about 10% of optically identified quasars were radio - luminous , leading to a division of quasars into radio-``loud '' and radio-``quiet '' objects .",
    "radio observations of optically selected quasars ( strittmatter et al .",
    "1980 and papers citing them ) found a bimodal distribution of the radio flux , radio luminosity , or ratio of radio to optical flux .",
    "this has resulted in many claims that there are two distinct populations , although it is still unclear whether they should be distinguished by considering the radio luminosity or the radio - optical flux ratio , and what the physical origin of this bimodality or dichotomy might be .",
    "more recently , the first radio survey has filled gaps in the radio - to - optical flux ratio distribution found in earlier , shallower surveys ( white et al 2000 ) , suggesting that the radio - loud and radio - quiet objects are instead the extremes of a continuum of sources .",
    "the sdss quasar survey targets both optically selected quasar candidates and point - like optical counterparts of first sources .",
    "together with the large number of sources compared to previous surveys , this allows to construct a series of volume - limited samples .",
    "this avoids any potential biases arising from the rapid evolution of quasar counts and luminosities with redshift .",
    "therefore , the sdss allows to take a different look at the bimodality question .",
    "once selection effects are taken into account , this approach amounts to constructing the bivariate radio - optical quasar luminosity function .",
    "we use data ( including rest - frame @xmath1-band luminosities ) from the quasar catalog ( schneider et al . 2003 ; also schneider et al . in this volume ) created from the sdss data release  1 ( abazajian et al .",
    "we restrict ourselves to first - selected quasar candidates and those identified by the `` low - redshift uv excess '' ( @xmath2 ) part of the color selection algorithm ( richards et al .",
    "this algorithm selects targets with non - stellar colors down to @xmath3 and has been sufficiently uniform and complete for dr1 data so that first results can be obtained without any corrections .",
    "we construct a series of volume - limited samples of radial extent @xmath4 , retaining only objects with luminosities between that corresponding to the faint flux limit at the upper redshift boundary ( @xmath5 for sdss , @xmath6 for first ) and that corresponding to the bright limit at the lower redshift boundary ( @xmath7 for sdss ; first practically has no bright limit ) .",
    "we construct volume - limited quasar samples between redshifts of 0.2 and 3.2 .",
    "this retains a few hundred objects in each redshift shell out of originally 10,000 .",
    "figure  [ f : llex ] shows an example of the distribution of quasars making the luminosity cut of both surveys in the luminosity - luminosity plane .",
    "they straddle the dividing line between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects as defined by a radio - optical luminosity ratio of 10 ( dashed line ) , with many objects lying close to the line .",
    "a caveat in the interpretation of this result is that two simplifications have been made : the @xmath8-correction did not take into account the actual spectral index of the quasar , but assumed a spectral shape @xmath9 for all objects at all wavelengths ( compare the contribution about quasar bimodality by ivezi et al . in these proceedings ) , and the radio sources include both flat- and steep - spectrum sources , while in principle we need to remove intrinsically fainter flat - spectrum sources which have been beamed above the survey limit .",
    "these corrections will be made in future work .    in this particular case ,",
    "the most luminous radio source is also the most luminous optical source , but this is not generally true - the maximum optical and radio luminosity in each bin are not well correlated .",
    "similarly , the radio and optical luminosities of objects within each bin are not strongly correlated , with correlation coefficients of the logarithmic luminosities typically in the range 0 - 0.5 .",
    "this rules out any strict power - law dependence between radio and optical luminosity with a scatter smaller than the luminosity range in each redshift shell ( which spans , however , only one decade or so in optical luminosity ) .",
    "instead , it requires a hidden parameter governing the radio luminosity relative to the optical .",
    "in addition to the objects shown in fig.[f : llex ] , each redshift shell also contains quasars in the same optical luminosity range but which have a first luminosity below the cutoff .",
    "it is possible to compare the radio properties of all sdss - detected quasars by constructing optical luminosity functions cumulated up to different maximum radio luminosities . the optical luminosity function becomes steeper as the maximum radio luminosity limit is lowered from the brightest detected source to the luminosity cutoff , i.e. , a luminous radio source is more likely ( but not _ required _ ) to be a luminous optical source as well .      in view of the strong evolution of quasar",
    "counts with redshift , it is of considerable interest whether the fraction of radio - loud objects changes with redshift . ( the magnitude of the fraction depends on the ratio of the radio and optical flux limits and can not in itself be interpreted easily . ) in the case of sdss , it is not sufficient to consider merely the fraction of first detections among all quasars in each volume slice without completeness corrections because the survey employs sparse sampling of the color - selected candidates in certain redshift ranges ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the number of quasars targeted as point - source identification of first sources remains unchanged ( lower panel in fig.[f : redhist ] ) .",
    "ignoring this would lead to the erroneous conclusion that the fraction of radio - detected quasars increases drastically beyond @xmath10 .    instead",
    ", it is useful to consider the fraction of color - selected quasars ( both resolved and point sources ) which have a first detection ( upper panel in fig.[f : redhist ] ) .",
    "this fraction is remarkably constant , implying a similar evolution of radio and optical luminosity with redshift .",
    "this finding is in apparent contradiction to the preceding section , where we found no good radio - optical correlation on an object - by - object basis .",
    "the reconciliation lies in a radio - optical correlation with a scatter larger than the luminosity range we have considered in each redshift shell .",
    "it remains to investigate these correlations in more detail and to compare them to radio - optical correlations such as those found in the most powerful radio sources ( see , e.g. , willott et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
