    ", the hot finger extends even out to 200  au . an external uv radiation field from a nearby o or b star will most likely have the same effect .",
    "since such an external radiation field does not depend on the radial distance to the central star , we can speculate that it might turn this hot finger into a closed hot surface layer : a hot skin of several thousand k around the protoplanetary disk .",
    "this hot finger is less pronounced in the herbig ae model , even though pahs are included .",
    "this is due to the much lower uv flux from the central star . in the t tauri model ,",
    "the remnant material above the disk ( parental molecular cloud ) had a constant density of @xmath27  @xmath2 .",
    "for the herbig ae star , we considered a spherical cocoon with a power law @xmath28  @xmath2 .",
    "this surrounding material was mainly introduced to avoid boundary effects on the disk surface .",
    "since the density of the cocoon material decreases with distance for the herbig ae star , the gas stays hot even though the uv from the central star is diluted .",
    "[ fig : gas ] shows that this gas is going to be very hot ( 5000 - 10000  k ) .",
    "the m star model illustrates the effects of x - ray heating .",

    "[ fig : gas](d ) compares the gas temperature found with the x - ray fluxes taken from au mic and with 100 times lower fluxes .",
    "gas temperatures are typically a factor 2 - 10 lower in the reduced x - ray case .",
    "the chemical network used in this study is a small one with 48 species and 268 reactions .",
    "it is well suited to calculate the abundances of the relevant cooling species and contains the photochemistry important in the upper layers of protoplanetary disks .",
    "however , x - ray chemistry is missing so far and hence the results for the m star should be considered with caution . in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss the most important features of these chemical calculations .",
    "comparing fig  [ fig : chem](c ) and ( d ) reveals the impact of the stellar uv irradiation on key molecules like h@xmath29 and co. in the case of pure chromospheric uv flux , h@xmath29/h fraction in the outer disks upper layers is 1 , meaning that all hydrogen is in molecular form .",
    "also , the c / co transition occurs at lower optical depth than in the t tauri accretion model .",
    "as discussed above , the hot finger extends to much larger radii in the accretion model and this is also reflected in the oh and hco@xmath30 abundance structure .",
    "both species arise from the fact that h@xmath29 is collisionally destroyed by h and o in these layers ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kamp & dullemond 2004 ) ) .",
    "oh is subsequently photodissociated and this process leaves in @xmath31  % of the cases the o - atom in the @xmath32d excited state ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* strzer & hollenbach 1998 ) ) .",
    "this level gives rise to the [ oi ]  6300     line .",
    "the line can also be thermally excited at temperatures larger than 3000  k. the hot finger presents thus an ideal reservoir of gas for the 6300     line emission .    in conditions , where the disk is exposed to an external uv radiation field , like in the orion nebula , this hot finger might turn into a hot surface of the disk .",
    "actually , observations of the proplyds in orion with a narrow band filter centered on the 6300     line have revealed that this emission comes from the `` skin '' of the disk ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bally et al .",
    "the same line emission has also been observed in herbig ae / be stars by ( * ? ? ? * acke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .",
    "these authors are able to explain the emission using an oh abundance of @xmath33 and non - thermal emission . our model ,",
    "however , suggests that herbig ae stars show a hot finger similar to t tauri stars ; thus thermal emission might contribute significantly to the total emission and help to explain the [ oi ]  6300     line emission with smaller oh abundances and thus abundances closer to the ones derived in our modeling ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "m@xmath7/yr and pahs .",
    "the first column shows the h@xmath29/h fraction , the other columns show the abundances ( @xmath35 ) of co , oh and hco@xmath30 respectively . ]",
    "* aikawa et al . ( 1998 ) ) have shown that x - ray chemistry mainly enhances the presence of ions and thus may affect species that are formed via ion - molecule reactions .",
    "however , species like co seem to be rather unaffected and their abundance is mainly determined by the level of uv irradiation .",
    "we abstain from a detailed discussion of the observational consequences arising from the chemistry displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chem ] , and restrict ourselves instead to a purely theoretical interpretation .",
    "it is interesting to note the rather large abundance of molecular hydrogen and co in this disk model .",
    "this is due to the extremely low uv luminosity in the m star model .",
    "even though we used an active star , namely au mic , as a template for this model , the total luminosity is much smaller than in t tauri stars of similar activity level .",
    "the maximum of the oh abundance distribution coincides with the end of the hot x - ray heated surface . apparently , the chemistry there is very similar to what we noted for the hot finger .",
    "as the protoplanetary disks evolve , the dust grows into large grains and protoplanetesimals ; the total mass in large grains ( micron - sized ) is much smaller than the mass in the original dust disk and the entire disk becomes optically thin to continuum radiation .",
    "however , h@xmath29 and co photodissociation are not continuum processes and thus significant amounts of these molecules can lead to an efficient shielding of the uv radiation within the disks .     and co abundances in the optically thin disk models and gas and dust temperatures : ( a - c ) @xmath6  m@xmath7 , ( d - f ) @xmath36  m@xmath7 , ( g - i ) @xmath37  m@xmath7 , ( j - l ) @xmath5  m@xmath7 .",
    "contour lines show abundances @xmath38 in logarithmic steps .",

    "[ fig : thin ] illustrates the abundances of h@xmath29 and co in four disk models spanning a range from @xmath5 to @xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "the stellar radiation field is that of an a dwarf ( 8200 k , @xmath39 and the interstellar radiation field corresponds to the one in the solar neighbourhood ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "even though the disk masses span 4 orders of magnitude , the co densities in these disks span a much larger range .",
    "this is due to strong photodissociation in the lowest disk mass models .",
    "as the disk mass increases , shielding by h@xmath29 and co becomes more efficient until all carbon is in the form of co ( @xmath5  m@xmath7 model ) . while the co / h@xmath29 conversion factor in the most massive disk model is close to the canonical value of @xmath41 of molecular clouds , it can be as low as @xmath42 in the lowest mass model",
    "we used the 2d monte carlo code from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hogerheijde & van der tak ( 2000 ) ) to calculate the line emission from the optically thin disk models .",
    "these fluxes are especially interesting in the context of the new upcoming observing facilities like apex , alma , herschel and sofia .",
    "we placed the disks at a typical distance of 100  pc and inclined them by @xmath43 .",
    "for the lowest four co rotational lines j=1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , 3 - 2 , 4 - 3 , we assumed typical beam widths of 43 , 22 , 14 , and 11 \" respectively . at a distance of 100  pc , this means that the beam contains the entire disk .",
    "fig  [ fig : colines ] shows that the higher co rotational lines are better to detect , because the corresponding levels are more populated at the typical disk gas temperatures of 30 - 50  k. this figure illustrates also that the slope of the line fluxes as a function of disk mass is much steeper than 1 . as the disk masses become lower than 0.5  m@xmath8 , the gas becomes rapidly undetectable in co even with alma .    .",

    "we showed the importance of a proper inclusion of all radiation sources  stellar uv , x - rays and external irradiation  for the gas temperature and chemical structure of the disk .",
    "the chemistry of the outer protoplanetary disk layers is driven by irradiation ; thus it is important to take into account the shape of the radiation field and not only its strength .",
    "the wavelength distribution of uv photons in a t tauri star is very different from that in a mean interstellar radiation field . instead of using the umist photorates that were derived for a draine field , we conclude that it is necessary to integrate the respective photoionization and dissociation cross sections over the stellar spectrum .    an important step in understanding disk evolution and in setting the boundary conditions for planet formation , is the measurement of the disk gas mass as a function of time and type of central star . using our disk models",
    ", we conclude that future instrumentation like alma will allow the detection of transition disks down to 0.5  m@xmath8 of gas .",
    "disks span a wide range in parameter space  density , temperature , irradiation  and the chemical conditions we encounter in them range from extreme pdrs , diffuse clouds to dense clouds and even dark cores .",
    "however , these disks become much denser in the midplane than molecular clouds or dark cores and hence three body reactions will play a role there as well .",
    "any model that wants to treat the full chemistry needs to take into account photochemistry , x - ray chemistry , gas - grain chemistry and three body collisions as well as grain surface chemistry .",
    "progress in the future has to be made especially in the field of gas - grain chemistry ( a better understanding of desorption processes ) and grain surface chemistry .",
    "the latter is important in forming very large molecules and more complex organic species , the precursors of life .    in terms of disk modeling",
    ", the next generation models should be 2d hydrodynamical models that account for the proper treatment of mixing in the inner disk regions , where diffusion timescales are shorter than or comparable to the chemical timescales .",
    "these models would need a realistic energy equation for the gas , because the surface and intermediate layers are not dominated by accretion heating . as outlined above , the full chemistry ( gas chemistry , gas - grain and grain surface chemistry ) is very expensive and it might be necessary to optimize the chemical networks for the various parameter regimes in the disk .    we would like to thank jan - uwe ness for reducing the au mic chandra data and providing the x - ray fluxes for au mic .",
