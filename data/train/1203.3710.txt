    "the chromatic number of a graph is the least number of colours to colour the vertices of the given graph , such that no two adjacent vertices get the same colour .",
    "this maybe one of the most interesting quantity that can be defined on a graph , since a colouring only needs to satisfy the local criterion , yet the least possible number of colours seems to emerge from the global structure of the graph .",
    "the question that what criterion or structure of the graphs determines , or affectes , the chromatic number has been a richful source of many interesting problems in graph theory . that the planarity of the graphs forces the chromatic number be no more than 4 is the famous four colour theorem , which was proved by apel and haken using discharging methods , and simplyfied by robertson , sanders , seymour , and thomas [ 8 ] later .",
    "however , these proofs used an assistence of computer , and there are still lots of mathematicians trying to find a simple theoretical proof that does not need an aid of computer . on the other hand , there is a famous conjecture proposed by hugo hadwiger [ 6 ] in 1943 , which states that the chromatic number is no greater than the hadwiger number of the graph , the maximum number @xmath2 such that the graph contains @xmath3 minor .    to study the chromatic number and hadwiger number of graphs , we consider a function @xmath4 called the _ graph characteristic _ ,",
    "defined to be the function which assigns a number for each simple graph @xmath0 that decreases under arbitrary edge contractions and certain graph homomorphisms which are strong enough to yield a complete graph when applied to any given graph .",
    "the behaviour of the graph characteristic with edge contractions would give us some informations on the hadwiger number , while that with graph homomorphisms on the chromatic number of graphs .",
    "each graph characteristic then gives us a similtaneous upper bound for the hadwiger number @xmath5 and the chromaric number @xmath6 , and",
    "when @xmath5 equals the upper bound , the hadwiger s conjecture is true .    in this paper , we discuss three different graph characteristics which are strongly motivated by the euler - poincare characteristic for simplicial complex , which is an alternating sum of the number of cells of each dimension . indeed ,",
    "graph itself has cell structure with the vertices as 0-cells and the edges as 1-cells .",
    "then the euler - poincare characteristic for a graph @xmath7 with this cw - complex sturcture would be @xmath8,(we take the negative of the usual euler - poincare characteristic in order to make it decrease under the graph operations mentioned before . ) and this function indeed has the property required to be a graph characteristic .",
    "we call this the _ first graph characteristic _ and study in the section 2",
    ".    however , the number of vertices and edges are too simplified to capture the structural information of graphs ; they lack the information about how the vertices are connected to each other . to extend the first graph characteristic , we need to define the 2-cells in graphs .",
    "there is , indeed , a standard way to define 2-cells in a graph .",
    "consider the famous euler characterisric for graphs drawn in the surface of genus @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the number of regions in the plane determined by the planar drawing of the graph . then that @xmath11 holds is a well - known fact . here",
    ", in fact , we are veiwing the regions as the 2-cells of the graphs , and the euler characteristic is then the euler - poincare characteristic of the 2-dimensional cell complex . in this point of view , however , the euler characteristic is not defined on the graph itself , but on the underlying surface with the cell division given by the graph .",
    "moreover , the euler characteristic does not behave well with the graph homomorphisms .",
    "hence , instead of the regions , we consider the induced cycles of a given graph @xmath0 as the 2-cells in @xmath0 .",
    "note that the previous cw - structure was also a simplicial complex structure , but not anymore .",
    "then the euler - poincare characteristic becomes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the number of induced cycles , which we call _ the second graph characteristic _",
    ", studied in section 3 .    in section 4 ,",
    "we go one dimension higher ; we define the 3-cells in a graph @xmath0 as the induced subgraphs isomorphic to one of the certain four types of graphs called _ solid graphs _ , and call them _ the solids in @xmath0_. the graph charcteristic @xmath14 , called the _ the third graph characteristic _ , is studied in section 4 , where @xmath15 denote the number of solids in @xmath0 .",
    "some applications of the graph characteristic theroy to hadwiger conjecture are discussed in section 5 .",
    "all graphs in this paper are assumed to be finite and simple .",
    "if @xmath16 is a subgraph of @xmath0 and @xmath17 , then the graph @xmath18 is defined to be the subgraph of @xmath0 obtained by adding the new vertex @xmath19 to @xmath16 together with all edges incident to @xmath19 in @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath20 is a sugraph of @xmath0 , then @xmath21 is defined by the subgraph of @xmath0 obtained from @xmath22 by adding all edges in @xmath0 between @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath16 contains the two endpoints of @xmath24 , then @xmath25 denotes the subgraph of @xmath0 obtained by adding the new edge @xmath24 to @xmath16 .",
    "we define @xmath26 by @xmath16 if @xmath27 and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath16 is a subgraph of @xmath0 . then @xmath29 denotes the set of all neighbors of @xmath19 in @xmath16 .    in this paper , we focus on two fundamental graph operations ; edge and nonedge contraction .",
    "let @xmath30 be an edge of a simple graph @xmath7 .",
    "the graph @xmath31 obtained from @xmath0 by contracting the edge @xmath24 is the simple graph with vertex set @xmath32 and edge set @xmath33 that is , the edge @xmath24 and its two end points @xmath34 are contracted to a single vertex @xmath35 with induced adjacency .",
    "if @xmath36 is a nonedge of a graph @xmath0 , then the graph obtained by _ nonedge contraction of @xmath36 _ from @xmath0 is defined to be @xmath37 .",
    "hence nonedge contraction is the composition of adding the edge @xmath36 and then contracting @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that there are alternative definition for edge and nonedge contraction which allows multiple edges or loops .",
    "but we are not allowing the edge and nonedge contraction to generate any multiple edges or loops .",
    "for example , if we contract one edge @xmath24 of a triangle @xmath38 , then @xmath39 , the complete graph with two vertices .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph .",
    "a graph @xmath16 is a _",
    "minor _ of @xmath0 if it can be obtained by zero or more edge contractions from a subgraph of @xmath0 .",
    "equivalentely , @xmath16 is a minor of @xmath0 if it can be obtained by minor operations : edge deletion , vertex deletion , and edge contraction .",
    "but as long as we consider @xmath0 connected and its complete graph minor , we only need the edge contractions .",
    "that is ,    if @xmath0 is a connected graph and @xmath40 is a complete graph minor of @xmath0 , then there is a sequence of edge contractions from @xmath0 to @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the subgraph of @xmath0 from which the complete graph @xmath40 can be obtained by edge contractions .",
    "write @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath0 is connected , one can contract @xmath0 onto the vertex set of @xmath16 .",
    "that is , if we denote @xmath42 the connected component of @xmath43 , then one can contract each @xmath44 to a single vertex , say , @xmath45 .",
    "then applying the same edge contractions to @xmath0 , we get @xmath46 as the resulting graph .",
    "note that @xmath20 is connected , so that each vertex @xmath45 has some edge @xmath47 incident to it , not necessarily distinct .",
    "write @xmath48 .",
    "notice that @xmath49 can be obtained from @xmath16 by adding some edges , and hecne @xmath50 .",
    "then we have @xmath51 , and therefore we have obtained @xmath40 from @xmath0 only by edge contractions .",
    "though the chromatic number of a graph is defined by means of vertex colouring , there is another formulation of it using the notion of nonedge contraction .",
    "let @xmath7 be a simple connected graph with a nonedge @xmath36 .",
    "then it is easy to see that we can extend an arbitrary vertex colouring @xmath52 of @xmath53 to a vertex colouring @xmath54 of @xmath0 , by defining @xmath55 if @xmath56 and @xmath57 otherwise .",
    "hence @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is not a complete graph and @xmath52 is a vertex colouring of @xmath0 , then @xmath52 must colour some two nonadjacent vertices @xmath59 of @xmath0 by the same colour , since we need less than @xmath60 colours to colour @xmath61 vertices .",
    "then @xmath52 induces the colouring @xmath62 of @xmath53 , where @xmath63 if @xmath64 , and @xmath65 otherwise ; yields @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we conclude that if @xmath0 is non - complete , then there is a nonedge @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that @xmath67 . then by induction , we have that    let @xmath7 be a graph .",
    "then there is a sequence of nonedge contractions from @xmath0 to @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the chromatic number of a graph @xmath0 is the least possible size of the complete graph one can obtain from @xmath0 by successive nonedge contractions .",
    "more geometrically , think of a graph as a mobile made of magnetic vertices that pull each other , with some edges between them that never off any of the end vertices but can move freely in any angle .",
    "suppose that no two adjacent vertices pull each other .",
    "now one can gently `` fold '' some part of it so that any two non - adjacent vertices can be merged .",
    "then one gets a complete graph when there is no more applicable folding , and the size of the smallest possible complete graph is the chromatic number of that graph . note that the nonedge contraction is also called a vertex identification or a simple folding , and is an example of graph homomorphism .",
    "as mensioned before , we consider the cannonical cw - sturcure on the simple graphs ; 0-cells are the vertices , and 1-cells are edges .",
    "let @xmath7 be a connected graph .",
    "we define a function @xmath69 called _ the first graph characteristic _ by @xmath70    if @xmath7 is a connected graph with an edge @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath0 is simple , contraction of the edge @xmath24 can possibly make a set of double edges incident to @xmath35 that are to be deleted to be a single edge .",
    "hence the difference @xmath73 equals the number of double edges in @xmath31 plus @xmath74 for the contracted edge @xmath24 . then observe that the each double edge in @xmath31 comes from a triangle in @xmath0 using the edge @xmath24 .    if @xmath7 is a connected graph with an edge @xmath71 , then @xmath75 .    by proposition 2.1.1 , @xmath76    if @xmath7 is a connected graph then @xmath77 .",
    "that is , @xmath78    there is a sequence of succesive edge contractions from @xmath0 to @xmath79 , and each edge contraction decreases the first graph characteristic .",
    "hence the assertion is clear .",
    "let @xmath80 be the set of length 2 paths in @xmath0 , and @xmath81 be the set of length 2 paths from @xmath82 to @xmath19 .",

    ". then @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 .",
    "then the difference @xmath85 is the number of the double edges in @xmath53 incident to the vertex @xmath86 , and such number equals @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a connected graph with order at least @xmath88 , and suppose @xmath0 is not a complete graph",
    ". then @xmath0 contains @xmath89 as an induced subgraph . in other words",
    ", there are two vertices of distance @xmath88 in @xmath0 if @xmath0 is not a complete graph .",
    "a connected simple graph with order two is @xmath90 .",
    "hence we may assume @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath0 is not complete , there is a nonedge @xmath36 in @xmath0 . then there is a shortest path @xmath92 from @xmath82 to @xmath19 with length @xmath93 since @xmath0 is connected .",
    "let @xmath94 be three consecutive vertices on @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath95 since otherwise @xmath92 would not be the smallest path from @xmath82 to @xmath19 .",
    "hence @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected graph which is not a complete graph .",
    "then there is a nonedge @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that @xmath97 .    by proposition 2.2.2 , there are some nonedge @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that @xmath98",
    ". then proposition 2.2.1 yields @xmath99    if @xmath7 is a connected graph then @xmath100 .",
    "that is , @xmath101    use induction on the number of vertices .",
    "if @xmath102 , there is nothing to prove .",
    "suppose @xmath103 , and any connected graph @xmath16 such that @xmath104 satisfies the assertion .",
    "now by theorem 2.2.1 , there is a nonedge @xmath36 in @xmath0 such that @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath105 , and note that @xmath106 is an increasing function in @xmath107 .",
    "then since @xmath53 is a connected graph with one less vertex , the induction hypothesis tells us that @xmath108 this completes the induction .",
    "hence theorem 2.1.1 . and",
    "2.2.1 tells us that the first graph characteristic essentialy dicreases by the edge and nonedge contractions , and hence the resulting complete graphs @xmath79 and @xmath68 must have less values of @xmath69 then @xmath0 .",
    "but since @xmath106 is an increasing function in @xmath107 , we then have an upper bound both for @xmath5 and @xmath6 by means of @xmath109 .    for a connected graph @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath110",
    "is called the _ first upper bound _ of @xmath0 .    for a connected graph @xmath0 , both @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are bounded above by @xmath111 .    solving the quadratic inequality @xmath112 yields the assertion .",
    "note that the first graph characteristic is equivalent to the rank of fundamental group of a graph . to see this ,",
    "recall that the fundamental group of a connected graph @xmath0 is the free group generated by the edges not contained in a fixed maximal tree @xmath113 of @xmath0 .",
    "hence the number of generators of @xmath114 equals @xmath115 .",
    "therefore @xmath114 is the free group with @xmath116 generators .",
    "in this section , we consider the induced cycles of a given graph @xmath0 as the 2-cells and relate the number of them with the hadwiger number and chromatic number of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a connected graph .",
    "we define a function @xmath117 which is called _ the second graph characteristic _ by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the set of all induced cycles in @xmath0 .",

    "the property @xmath121 follows from the definition , and it implies the injectivity of @xmath130 .    recall that @xmath131 is the set of triangles in @xmath0 that uses the edge @xmath24 .    if @xmath7 is a connected graph with an edge @xmath71 , then @xmath132 .",
    "notice that no triangle @xmath113 in @xmath0 using the edge @xmath24 is not in the image of @xmath130 , since @xmath133 and there is no induced cycle in @xmath31 with two vertices .",
    "then it follows that @xmath134 now we finish the proof by observing that @xmath135    if @xmath0 is a connected graph then @xmath136 .",
    "that is , @xmath137    similar to the proof of corollary 2.1.1 .",
    "now that we know the second graph characteristic decreases via edge contraction , we would like to know when the second characteristic does not change .",
    "this can be done by investigating the map @xmath130 in detail .",
    "let @xmath7 be a graph with an edge @xmath71 .",
    "divide the induced cycles in @xmath0 that are not triangles using @xmath24 into two classes , one of which consists of induced cycles in @xmath0 that remains an induced cycle in @xmath31 , and the other its compliment .",
    "that is @xmath119 is a disjoint union of @xmath131 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 .",
    "note that the triangles of @xmath131 are the cycles of @xmath119 which are to be contracted to @xmath90 in @xmath31 , and hence the cycles of the other two classes remain a cycle in @xmath31 .",

    "it is easy to see that an induced cycle @xmath123 does not remain an induced cycle in @xmath31 if and only if there is a length 2 path in @xmath0 using the edge @xmath24 such that whose two endpoints are nonadjacent and vertices of @xmath123 ; for , if @xmath123 uses @xmath24 , then @xmath142 does not have a crossing edge in @xmath31 and otherwise , the existence of the crossing edge of @xmath142 in @xmath31 is equivalent to the existence of such length 2 path in @xmath0 . for each cycle @xmath123 of @xmath141 ,",
    "let us associate an induced subgraph @xmath143 if @xmath123 uses @xmath82 or @xmath144 if @xmath123 uses @xmath19 .",

    "let us give an equivalence relation on the class @xmath147 by defining @xmath148 if @xmath149 .",
    "then by the definition of @xmath130 , we see that a class @xmath150 $ ] has size 2 if and only if @xmath123 uses either @xmath82 or @xmath19 and both @xmath151 and @xmath151 are induced cycles in @xmath31 , and otherwise @xmath150 $ ] consists only one cycle .",
    "note that each equivalence class in @xmath152 contains exactly one cycle which belongs to the image of @xmath130 ; hence the number of cycles of the class @xmath141 is the number of size 2 equivalence class in @xmath152 .",

    "we then have @xmath155 .",

    "clearly @xmath170 .",
    "a. d. scott [ 9 ] related the induced cycles and chromatic number , by proving that for any pair of integers @xmath171 , there exists an integer @xmath172 such that every graph with chromatic number at least @xmath172 contains either @xmath173 or an induced odd cycle of length @xmath174 or an induced cycle of length @xmath175 .",

    "one of such candidate is the _ hajos operation _ , which is defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath771 are two connected graphs with vertices @xmath772 such that @xmath773 and @xmath774 and @xmath775 , then we define the graph @xmath776 obtained from @xmath771 via the hajos operation by @xmath777    in the following arguments , we would not assume the four colour theroem .",
    "but we may use the fact that the hadwiger class contains every graph @xmath0 such that @xmath778 , which is clear .",
    "the hadwiger class @xmath769 is closed under following graph operations :    \\(a ) deletion of a cut - edge    \\(b ) clique - sum    \\(c ) hajos operation    \\(d ) subdivision",
    "\\(a ) let @xmath24 be a cut - edge of a graph @xmath779 , and denote the two components of @xmath780 by @xmath327 and @xmath781 .",
    "we may assume @xmath782 .",
    "then one has @xmath783 and @xmath784 , from which we get @xmath785 .",
    "\\(b ) let @xmath771 be graphs in the class @xmath769 with subgraphs @xmath786 which are isomorphic to @xmath743 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the graph obtained from @xmath787 and @xmath788 by identifying @xmath789 and @xmath252 .",
    "then colouring both graphs requires at least @xmath478 different colours .",
    "now label the vertices of @xmath789 and @xmath252 by the numbers from @xmath74 to @xmath478 , so that the two vertices of the same number are identified in the clique - sum .",
    "now fix colourings of @xmath787 and @xmath788 , and permute the colours so that each vertices of @xmath789 and @xmath252 gets the same colour as the label .",
    "hence the proper colourings of @xmath787 and @xmath788 agrees on @xmath789 and @xmath252 , which shows @xmath790 .",
    "since we need at least @xmath791 colours to colour @xmath0 , we have @xmath792 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath793 .",
    "hence we conclude @xmath779 , since @xmath794    \\(c ) let @xmath795 with the vertices @xmath772 described in the definition of hajos operation .",
    "if @xmath796 is a cut - edge of @xmath787 and @xmath797 is not a cut - edge of @xmath788 , then @xmath0 can be obtained by first deleting the cutedge @xmath796 from @xmath0 and then clique - summing the two componont to @xmath788 using the 1-cliques(single vertices ) @xmath125 and @xmath798 . hence by @xmath799 and @xmath800 , we have @xmath779 .",
    "a similar argument applies to the case that both @xmath796 and @xmath797 are cut - edges .",
    "now we suppose none of the two edges is a cut - edge .    if both @xmath787 and @xmath788 are 2-colourable , then @xmath0 is @xmath493-colourable .",
    "since we know that the hadwiger class contains all graphs with hadwiger number less than 4 , it automatically follows that @xmath779 .",
    "now we may suppose @xmath801 . since @xmath796 is not a cut - edge of @xmath787 , @xmath802",
    "is connected so that it is contractible to the single vertex @xmath125 via edge contractions .",
    "once we contract @xmath802 to @xmath125 , we get a graph isomorphic to @xmath788 and hence @xmath788 is a minor of @xmath0 . by symmetric argument , @xmath787 is also a minor of @xmath0 .",
    "this shows @xmath803 .",
    "for the chromatic number , let @xmath804 be a proper colouring of @xmath787 with @xmath805 and @xmath806 .",
    "then if @xmath807 is any proper colouring of @xmath788 , then we may permute the colours so that @xmath808 and @xmath809 .",
    "we may assume @xmath807 is such a colouring .",
    "then the colourings @xmath804 and @xmath807 induces a proper colouring @xmath52 of @xmath0 , since @xmath810 and @xmath798 got differenc colour so that adding the edge @xmath811 does not violate the colouring of @xmath812 .",
    "this shows @xmath790 , and therefore we have @xmath779 .",
    "let @xmath779 and let @xmath813 be a subdivision of @xmath0 .",
    "it suffices to show the assertion for @xmath813 which is obtained from @xmath0 by subdividing a single edge @xmath814 , since any subdivision of @xmath0 can be obtained by successively subdividing the edges of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose @xmath813 is obtained from @xmath0 by substituting the edge @xmath24 by a length @xmath403 path @xmath92.let @xmath123 be a cycle of length @xmath403 such that @xmath815 .",
    "let @xmath798 be a neighbor of @xmath125 in @xmath123 .",
    "then observe that @xmath813 can be obtained from the hajos operation of @xmath787 and @xmath123 , that is , @xmath816 then ( c ) yields @xmath817 .",
    "this proves the assertion .",
    "we have seen that the graphs with hadwiger number @xmath818 belongs to the hadwiger class .",
    "moreover , some special graphs such as the complete graphs , complete multipartite graphs and perfect graphs also belong to this class . also recall that chordal graphs are the graphs which have no induced cycles of length at least 4 .",
    "seymour and weaver [ 4 ] characterized the chordal graphs as the graphs that can be obtained by clique sums of complete graphs . since complete graphs are in the hadwiger class and the class",
    "is closed under the clique sum , it is automatic that every chordal graphs are in the hadwiger class as well .",
    "in fact , more strongly , the chordal graphs are actually perfect graphs , as observed by berge [ 5 ] .",
    "in addition to the already observed kind of graphs that belong to the hadwiger class , we add some more , which we have found through our graph characteristic theory .",
    "the hadwiger class @xmath769 contains a graph @xmath0 if it satisfies @xmath819 for some @xmath820 .",
    "the hypothesis and corollary 2.2.1 , 3.2.1 and 4.3.1 yields that @xmath821 .",
    "since @xmath822 is an increasing function in @xmath823 , we obtain @xmath824 .    in order to characterize such graphs described in the assertion",
    ", we need to figure out the special edge contractions that keeps the value of the graph characteristic the same , and consider the graphs obtained from the complete graphs through the `` inverse '' of that special edge contractions .",
    "we shall leave it as a further research .",
