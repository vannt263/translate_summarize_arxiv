    "speeds of the solar wind ( sw ) in the vicinity of the earth vary from @xmath0300 to @xmath0800km / s @xcite .",
    "the sw speed is one of the important parameters to predict geomagnetic storms triggered by interactions between the sw plasma and the earth magnetosphere ( e.g. wu & lepping 2002 ) .",
    "if we can tell sw conditions near the earth from observed properties on the sun , we can forecast geomagnetic conditions beforehand since it takes a few days until the sw reaches us after emanating from the sun .",
    "thus , various attempts have been carried out to derive simple relations which connect physical properties on the sun and sw speeds near the earth .",
    "wang & sheeley ( 1990 ; 1991 , hereafter ws90 and ws91 ) showed that sw speeds are anti - correlated with expansion factors of magnetic flux tubes from their long - term observations as well as by a simple theoretical model , and this relation is widely used to predict sw speeds ( e.g. arge & pizzo 2000 ) .",
    "fisk , schwadron , & zurbuchen ( 1999 ; hereafter fsz ) claimed that the sw speed should have a positive dependence on the magnetic field strength on the sun .",
    "@xcite puts forward a sw scaling which explains the observed anti - correlation between the sw speed and freezing - in temperatures , reflecting the coronal temperature , of ions @xcite .",
    "@xcite further introduced a correlation between a scale length in the chromosphere and the sw speed .    turning to the acceleration mechanism of the sw",
    ", it is generally believed that the wave is a promising candidate which dominantly works both in heating and accelerating the sw plasma ( belcher 1971 ; ofman 2004 , cranmer 2005 ; suzuki & inutsuka 2005 ; 2006 ; hereafter , si05 and si06 ) . however , there is no fundamental relation derived so far , which is directly linked with the wave .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive a simple formula which connects the sw speed and the solar surface conditions through waves by referring to results of recent numerical simulations ( si05 , si06 ) .    from an observational viewpoint kojima et al.(2005 ) have extensively surveyed relations between sw speeds around one astronomical unit ( 1au ) , @xmath1 , and properties of magnetic flux tubes , radial magnetic field strength at the photosphere , @xmath2 , and a ( total ) super - radial expansion factor of the tube , @xmath3 during a solar minimum phase , 1995 - 1996 ( figure 1 ) , where the values are averaged over each open coronal hole and the potential field - source surface method ( e.g. sakurai 1982 ) is used to derive @xmath3 .",
    "they claimed that a ratio , @xmath4 , is the best indicator of @xmath1 ( top panel ) ( see also suess et al.1984 ) , whereas they also found a moderate correlation of @xmath5 ( middle panel ) ( ws90 ) and a weak correlation of @xmath6 ( bottom panel ) ( fsz ) .",
    "note that , only within the framework of the potential field - source surface method , @xmath4 is equivalent with magnetic field strength at the source surface ( assumed at 2.5@xmath7 ; @xmath7 is the solar radius ) , the outside of which field lines are assumed be radially oriented @xcite , while they use the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as it stands because it is more physically motivated ( see  3 ) .",
    "@xmath3 used in this letter is defined as the total expansion factor from the solar surface to 1au .",
    "the obtained nice correlation of @xmath8 seems quite reasonable ; the positive correlation on @xmath2 appears natural since @xmath2 controls strength of poynting energy which is injected from the surface and finally accelerates the sw ( fsz ) ; the negative dependence on @xmath3 seems reasonable as well because @xmath3 determines adiabatic loss of the sw in the flux tubes ( ws91 ) ( figure 2 ) .",
    "one may further speculate that the @xmath8 relation reflects waves , a type of poynting flux , in the diverging flux tubes . here",
    "i develop this consideration to give a quantitate interpretation of the relation .",
    "i derive a simple relation which determines the sw speed near the earth from conditions on the solar surface based on a basic energy conservation relation .",
    "i consider an open magnetic flux tube measured by heliocentric distance , @xmath9 , which is anchored at the solar surface , @xmath10 . under the steady - state condition ,",
    "the energy equation becomes @xmath11 + q_{\\rm r } = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are density , velocity , temperature , magnetic field strength , conductive flux and radiative cooling , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively gas constant , a ratio of specific heat , the gravitational constant and the solar mass .",
    "the term involving @xmath15 denotes poynting flux under the ideal magnetohydrodynamical approximation .",
    "the cross section of the tube is assumed to expand in proportion to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a super - radial expansion function ( @xmath24 and @xmath25)@xcite .",
    "note that divergence of an arbitrary vector , @xmath26 , becomes @xmath27 .",
    "the poynting flux term can be divided into two parts , @xmath28 , where subscript @xmath9 denotes the component along the flux tube and @xmath29 indicates the tangential components ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are amplitudes of transverse fluctuations of magnetic field and velocity .",
    "the first term indicates shear of magnetic field , corresponding to waves , and the second term denotes advection of magnetic energy .",
    "following fsz , i consider the energy conservation in the flux tube between at the solar surface ( @xmath10 ) and at 1au ( @xmath32 ) . at the surface , besides the gravitational potential , dynamical and magnetical energy associated with the surface convection gives an important contribution . here",
    "i rearrange these terms concerning the inputs of energy by the convection into two parts , @xmath33_r + \\rho v(\\frac{v^2}{2 } +   \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}rt)= -\\frac{1}{4\\pi } b_r \\delta b_{\\perp }   \\delta v_{\\perp }   + f_{\\rm h}$ ] , namely incompressive part ( wave ) , @xmath34 , and compressive part , @xmath35 .",
    "note that the magnetic energy term ( @xmath36 ) is included in @xmath35 . at 1au",
    "the dominant term is the kinetic energy of sw ( fsz ) .",
    "then , the energy conservation in the flux tube gives @xmath37_{r={\\rm 1au } } = \\left[r^2   \\left(-\\frac{b_r \\langle   \\delta b_{\\perp } \\delta v_{\\perp}\\rangle}{4\\pi } + f_{\\rm h } -   \\rho v \\frac{g m_{\\odot}}{r}\\right)\\right]_{r= r_{\\odot } }   - \\int_{r_{\\odot}}^{\\rm 1au } dr r^2   f q_{\\rm r } , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes time - average .",
    "thermal conduction does not appear explicitly because it only works in redistribution of the temperature structure between the two locations .",
    "the reason of the decomposition of the energy injection terms into the two parts is that their dissipation characters are different .",
    "generally , the dissipation of the wave is slow since it is hardly steepen to shocks .",
    "therefore , waves propagate a long distance to contribute to the heating and acceleration of the sw around @xmath0 a few to @xmath39 ( si06 ) . on the other hand , compressive waves and turbulences denoted by @xmath35 are more dissipative so that they only contribute to the heating in the chromosphere @xcite and the low corona @xcite . most of the energy of @xmath35 which dissipates in the corona is lost by downward thermal conduction toward the chromosphere , which finally radiates away in the transition region and the upper chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the rest ( @xmath40 ) of the energy is transferred to enthalpy flux @xcite to keep the hot corona with @xmath41k .",
    "the radiative cooling ( last term in equation [ eq : engeq2 ] ) is also only efficient in the low corona or below where the density is sufficiently high .",
    "therefore , subtraction of the radiative loss from @xmath35 gives ` effective ' coronal temperature , @xmath42 , namely @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we have a conservation equation : @xmath44\\right\\}_{r = r_{\\odot}}.    \\label{eq : cmp}\\ ] ] the second term ( @xmath45 ) on the right hand side is evaluated at the base of the corona in the strict sense since it implicitly considers the energy balance at the transition region ( see  3 ) .",
    "however , i use the location , @xmath46 , because the distance between the photosphere and the corona is much smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "a conceptional novelty of the present formulation is that i explicitly include the wave term which was neglected ( fsz ) or parameterized in more phenomenological ways ( ws91 ; schwadron & mccomas 2003 ) in previous works .",
    "note that @xmath48(@xmath49 for outgoing waves ) is a conserved quantity of waves which propagate in static media if they do not dissipate where we have used conservation of magnetic field , @xmath50const .",
    "incidently , in moving media wave action should be used as a conserved quantity instead of energy flux @xcite . ] . therefore , @xmath51 is a measure of dissipation and reflection of waves in the chromosphere and the low corona where the gas is almost static , and the results of numerical simulations ( si05 ; si06 ) can be used for the wave term in a straightforward manner .",
    "the physical meaning of equation ( [ eq : cmp ] ) is clear ; the kinetic energy of the sw at 1au is determined by positive contributions from the input wave energy ( first term ) and the thermal pressure of the corona ( second term ) and a negative contribution due to the gravitational potential well ( third term ) .",
    "rearranging equation ( [ eq : cmp ] ) by using the mass conservation relation , @xmath52_{r={\\rm 1au } } = [ \\rho v r^2]_{r = r_\\odot}$ ] , we can derive a more direct form which predicts sw speeds in the vicinity of the earth from the physical conditions on the solar surface : @xmath53 where i use the observed mass flux at 1au , @xmath54(g @xmath55 ) , which is almost constant even in sws with different speeds ( e.g. aschwanden , poland , & rabin 2001 ) .",
    "the velocity amplitude at the surface can be estimated from observed granulation motions at the photosphere as @xmath56km / s @xcite .",
    "the magnetic amplitude is derived from @xmath31 and the photospheric density @xmath57 g @xmath58 as @xmath59 g .",
    "then , @xmath60(g cm s@xmath61 ) , where a factor of 1/2 is included due to the time - average .",
    "this value is for the case in which all the waves from the surface propagate into the sw region . in the real situation , they suffer reflection in the chromosphere .",
    "si05 shows only @xmath62% of the initial energy propagates outwardly to contributes to the heating of the coronal and sw plasma .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath63(g cm s@xmath61 ) as a fiducial value . as for the thermal pressure ,",
    "i assume @xmath64k as a typical coronal temperature .",
    "@xmath19 should be larger than the adiabatic value ( @xmath65 ) because of the thermal conduction @xcite ; i consider @xmath66 in this paper .",
    "i plot relations derived from equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "the fiducial case with @xmath67(g cm s@xmath61 ) and @xmath64(k ) ( solid line ) explains the observed trend quite well .",
    "the @xmath68 relation reflects the waves which accelerate the sw in expanding magnetic flux tubes .",
    "@xmath69 determines energy flux of the waves ( @xmath70_{\\odot}$ ] ) . @xmath3",
    "controls dilution of the energy flux ; in a flow tube with larger @xmath3 more energy is used to expand the tube rather than transfered to the kinetic energy of sw .",
    "thus , the positive dependence on @xmath2 and the negative dependence on @xmath3 are naturally derived .",
    "the result does not depend on different dissipation processes of waves because i only consider the sw speed at the sufficiently distant location ( @xmath71au ) where the wave energy are mostly dissipated .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 also exhibits that @xmath4 is the most important parameter in determining the sw speed and that other physical conditions on the solar surface should be similar .",
    "almost all the data are between dot - dashed and dashed lines which are the results of cases adopting slightly larger @xmath42(@xmath72k ) and smaller @xmath73 ( @xmath74 g cm s@xmath61 ) than the fiducial case .",
    "particularly , the difference of the wave amplitudes ( @xmath75 ) between the solid and dashed lines are only 20% .",
    "this indicates that the amplitudes of waves at the surface should be very similar in different coronal holes .",
    "the observed data are from not only polar coronal holes but mid - latitude and equatorial coronal holes , some of which are located near active regions .",
    "therefore , one can infer that the amplitudes could vary a lot since the circumstances are quite different .",
    "however , the observation seems to favor the constancy of the fluctuations at the footpoints .",
    "although it is very difficult to observe motions of field lines on the solar surface at present @xcite , this can be observationally studied in the very near future by solar - b satellite which can stably observe fine - scale motions of surface magnetic fields .",
    "let me compare the present analysis with a model calculation for the @xmath5 correlation by ws91 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although it is not simple to compare both since the assumptions adopted in ws91 are different from mine ( for example , ws91 fixed the coronal base density , while i adopt the constant mass flux at 1au ) , i can derive a relation of @xmath5 from equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) by using similar constraints to those considered in ws91 .",
    "they adopted a constant field strength at 1au , @xmath76 g , and assumed a constant energy flux ( @xmath77erg @xmath55s@xmath61 ) at the coronal base . in the middle panel of figure 1 ,",
    "i present the result with fixed @xmath78 , corresponding to @xmath79 g , and energy flux of waves , @xmath80erg @xmath55s@xmath61 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath81 ) in equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) by the dotted line .",
    "note that i need the larger energy flux because the inner boundary is not the coronal base but the photosphere .",
    "the figure shows that the dotted line follows the average trend of the data and the result of ws91 is reasonable .",
    "however , i would like to address that some data are located away from the main @xmath5 trend and they can be explained in a unified manner by taking into account @xmath2 .",
    "the relation of equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) seemingly contradicts to the reported anti - correlation of the coronal temperature and the sw speed @xcite .",
    "this is because my treatment of the thermal processes near the surface is too much simplified ; the complicated energy balance from the chromosphere to the low corona is represented only by the ` effective ' enthalpy , @xmath82 .",
    "the formulation for the temperature - velocity relation by @xcite is complementary to the present formulation . in @xcite",
    "the detailed energy balance at the transition region is taken into account , while they assumed a constant input of the wave energy flux which i investigate more in detail .    in this letter , in order to focus on the sw speed ,",
    "i simply apply the observed ( almost ) constant mass flux at 1au when deriving the relation for the sw speed . for self - consistent treatments , however , it is important to study how to determine the mass flux of the sw not only by numerical simulations ( e.g. si06 ) but by simple models .",
    "i think that equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) is applicable to sws during both sunspot minimum and maximum phases because it is derived based only on the simple energetics . at present , however , the observed data ( kojima et al.2005 ) which i use for the comparison are only during the sunspot minimum phase ( 1995 - 1996 ) . in order to study the generality of the derived relation , comparisons with sw data during different phases ( fujiki et al.2006 ) are important .",
    "one should be careful that @xmath3 which should be used for the prediction is the actual super - radial expansion factor from @xmath7 to 1au , while in most cases , including kojima et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , @xmath3 is observationally estimated from the comparison between at @xmath7 and at the source surface ( @xmath83 ) based on the potential field - source surface method .",
    "errors due to this method could be non - negligible if the potential approximation becomes worse and/or if one separately treats flux tubes in a coronal hole ( ws90 ) .",
    "( in this sense , kojima et al.2005 as well as i use @xmath4 instead of field strength at the source surface . )",
    "thus , the precise determination of coronal magnetic fields ( e.g. linker et al.1999 ) is important for reliable forecasts of sw speeds from the relation of equation ( [ eq : swv ] ) .",
