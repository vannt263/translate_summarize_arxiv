    "in this work we will study the behaviour of the @xmath0 interaction in a nucleus as a function of the strength of the interaction .",
    "although this is a model study it helps to make things concrete by focusing on a particular nucleus .",
    "we choose @xmath14 .",
    "this nucleus is of particular interest because in a @xmath3 space calculation with @xmath15 there are some interesting degeneracies .",
    "for example , the @xmath12 and @xmath16 states are degenerate , and both have orbital symmetry [ 400 ] .",
    "the @xmath17 states with orbital symmetry [ 330 ] and [ 411 ] are degenerate .",
    "thus we have two sets of degenerate triplets @xmath8 and @xmath9 emanating from the above two orbital configurations .",
    "these degeneracies can easily be found by applying the @xmath18 formula :    @xmath19\\ ] ]    if we write the interaction as @xmath20 then , in the @xmath3 space and when we change @xmath21 , the degeneracies will not be removed .",
    "all that will happen is that the energies of all states will be proportional to @xmath21 , and so the spectrum will be blown up or shrunk as @xmath21 is made larger or smaller .    what happens though if we include contributions from other major shells ?",
    "the @xmath0 interaction will not connect @xmath22 states because of parity arguments , but there will be @xmath23 admixtures . indeed , the concept of an @xmath24 effective charge is often illustrated by using a @xmath0 interaction to obtain @xmath23 admixtures .",
    "it has been shown by bes and sorensen  @xcite that if in the valence space ( @xmath3 ) the appropriate @xmath0 interaction is @xmath25 , then in a space which includes @xmath26 excitations the appropriate strength is @xmath27 .",
    "we wish to vary the interaction , and we therefore parameterize it as    @xmath28    so that for @xmath29 we have the standard choice of bes and sorensen  @xcite . for @xmath14",
    ", we have @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian we use is    @xmath31    we perform shell model calculations using the oxbash shell model code  @xcite in the space @xmath32 plus @xmath33 excitations . as mentioned in the introduction , when harmonic oscillator wave functions are used in a single major shell , the single particle terms in the above hamiltonian are constant , so that the only part of the hamiltonian that affects the spectra is the two - body term .",
    "the separation of energies is linear in @xmath4 -the wave functions are unaffected by the choice of ( positive ) @xmath4 .",
    "however , when @xmath34 excitations are allowed , the linear terms are no longer constant , and the behaviour as a function of @xmath4 is more complicated .",
    "we will now study this behaviour as a function of @xmath4 in @xmath14 .      in table",
    "i we present @xmath29 results for @xmath14 in a large space @xmath32 plus all @xmath33 excitations .",
    "we present the results for the energies of @xmath35 and @xmath9 @xmath36 states , as well as @xmath37 and @xmath38 transitions from the ground state to these states .",
    "more precisely , it is the isovector @xmath37 in units of @xmath39 and isoscalar @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) in units of @xmath41 .",
    "we see that there are many degeneracies still present in the large space @xmath42 four @xmath43 states at 12.12 @xmath44 and three at 13.90 @xmath44 , as well as three @xmath45 states at 12.12 @xmath44 .",
    "these degeneracies clearly correspond to various @xmath46 combinations for states of given @xmath47 and orbital symmetry [ @xmath48 .",
    "however , other ` accidental ' degeneracies which were present in the small space @xmath32 are no longer present .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states at 3.74 @xmath44 and 7.31 @xmath44 are linear combinations of the @xmath51 [ 330 ] and @xmath51 [ 411 ] configurations ( actually they are parts of @xmath52 triplets ) . in the small space , these two @xmath35 states ( or triplets ) were degenerate -now one of the states is almost at twice the excitation energy of the other .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath16 states are no longer degenerate .",
    "the @xmath12 state is at 2.19 @xmath44 with @xmath53 from the ground state of 63.8 @xmath41 , whilst the @xmath16 state is at 3.40 @xmath44 with @xmath54 .",
    "note that , contrary to experiment , the second @xmath9 state is the one most strongly excited .",
    "when a reasonable spin - orbit interaction is added to the hamiltonian the situation is corrected .",
    "it should be pointed out that in perturbation theory , in which only the _ direct _ part of the particle - hole interaction of @xmath0 is used to renormalize the interaction between two particles in the valence space , the degeneracies above would _ not _ be removed .",
    "the relevant diagram is the familiar bertsch - kuo - brown bubble ( or phonon ) exchange between two nucleons  @xcite . for a simple @xmath55 interaction , this diagram simply renormalizes the strength of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "clearly , changing the strength in the valence space will not remove the degeneracies .",
    "thus , the shell model diagonalization implicitly contains effects beyond the direct bubble diagram .",
    "furthermore , these effects are quite important .",
    "we now vary @xmath4 over the range @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "1 we plot as a dot - dash curve the value of @xmath57 for the lowest @xmath9 state , the one with finite but small @xmath38 strength from ground .",
    "we also plot @xmath57 as a solid line for the state with the strongest @xmath38 from ground .",
    "it starts off at @xmath29 as the second @xmath9 state . in the @xmath3 space",
    ", the @xmath12 and @xmath16 states would be degenerate , and the curve for @xmath57 vs. @xmath4 would be a horizontal line . however , in the @xmath58 space there is a dependence on @xmath4 ( and more so for the solid curve ) .",
    "but , for @xmath59 and beyond , all the @xmath38 strength from ground state goes to the new lowest @xmath9 state .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath57 becomes constant for @xmath60 @xmath61 the curve becomes horizontal . clearly , the nature of the ground state changed beyond @xmath62",
    ". we will now examine this change in more detail .",
    "if the only thing that happened was that there was a new @xmath63 ground state , then of course there would be a sudden change in the @xmath53 s from this new ground state to the @xmath9 states .",
    "however , the static quadrupole moments of the @xmath9 states themselves would not change .",
    "for @xmath64 the @xmath53 to the @xmath12 state is 40.61 @xmath65 and to the @xmath6 state 158.0 @xmath41 .",
    "the calculated static quadrupole moments are respectively 11.56 @xmath66 and -11.46 @xmath66 . as discussed by fayache , sharma and zamick in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is consistent with the two @xmath9 states being prolate , with about the same intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath67 , but the lower state would have @xmath68 and the upper one @xmath69 . indeed , for @xmath69 @xmath70 , and for @xmath68 @xmath71 .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath64 is maintained for @xmath72 and 1.5 , but for @xmath62 and up to @xmath73 there is a big drop in @xmath74 .",
    "the other three quantities do not change , not even -strangely enough- @xmath75 .",
    "remember that for @xmath73 we are still below the critical @xmath4 for which the @xmath63 ground state changes its nature .",
    "what is clearly happening is that a third @xmath9 state has crossed over and came below what was formerly the @xmath6 state .",
    "this is confirmed by noting that at @xmath73 the @xmath76 is very large ( 162.1 @xmath41 ) .",
    "clearly , in going from @xmath62 to @xmath73 , the @xmath6 and @xmath77 states have interchanged positions .",
    "the fact that the static quadrupole moments of the two states are about the same means that both states can be associated with two different prolate @xmath69 bands which have the same deformation .",
    "next we consider @xmath78 . here",
    "we are just beyond the critical @xmath4 , and the nature of the ground state has changed .",
    "now the @xmath38 to the @xmath5 state is much weaker , and the @xmath38 to the @xmath6 state is strong .",
    "this suggests that the new @xmath79 ground state and the new @xmath6 state are members of a new rotational band , and that both of these states have come down in energy together .",
    "when we go from @xmath78 to @xmath80 there is a big change , but the results stabilize beyond that . now the @xmath38 to the @xmath12 state is the strongest ( 140 @xmath41 ) , and the _ signs _ of the static quadrupole moments change .",
    "now @xmath81 is negative , and @xmath75 is positive .",
    "what is clearly happening is that there is another cross - over . what was formerly the @xmath77 state at @xmath62 first crosses the the @xmath6 state at @xmath73 ( as mentioned above ) , and now crosses the @xmath5 state at @xmath80 .",
    "by @xmath80 and beyond , the @xmath79 and @xmath9 members of a new band have become the lowest two states , and the results stabilize .",
    "in fig . 2 we plot the rapid descent of the @xmath63 and @xmath9 members of the new rotational band .",
    "we start from @xmath29 , but if we project backward we see that for small @xmath4 the band emanates from the @xmath10 region . to better ascertain the nature of the new band , we give in table iii the occupancies of the single - particle levels that were used in this calculation",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath82 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath83 .    at @xmath62 , just before the critical value , the @xmath63 ground state is normal .",
    "the occupancy of the four major shells ( in the order mentioned above ) is 3.84 , 5.78 , 0.18 and 0.20 .",
    "the first excited @xmath79 state at 0.585 @xmath44 has occupancy 4 , 4 , 2 and 0 . clearly two nucleons have been excited from @xmath3 to @xmath13 .",
    "what is at first surprising is that , for this state , the occupancies are _",
    "precisely integers_. this is not an isolated example .",
    "it is also true at @xmath62 for the second @xmath9 state at 4.33 @xmath44 .",
    "when we go to @xmath84 , we have passed the critical value , and things have settled down .",
    "the lowest @xmath79 and @xmath9 states are now the @xmath85 states , both with the integer occupancies 4 , 4 , 2 and 0 .    whereas most states do not have integer occupancies , there are many which do . these are at higher energies .",
    "for example , for @xmath62 , there are other states with the occupancy 4 , 4 , 2 , 0 at 21.64 , 22.95 , 22.97 , 25.32 and 35.75 @xmath44 .",
    "these are states with occupancy ( 3 , 4 , 1 , 0 ) at 43.6 and 44.2 @xmath44 . the latter correspond to lifting one nucleon through two major shells .",
    "why do we get such a simple behaviour for the @xmath85 states ?",
    "the answer involves a special feature of the @xmath0 interaction : all matrix elements in which two particles in a major shell @xmath86 scatter into a major shell @xmath87 vanish .",
    "this is due to a parity selection rule .",
    "for example , @xmath88 factors into @xmath89 , and each of these factors vanishes because of this parity rule .    carrying the argument further",
    ", there can be no matrix element coupling the @xmath90 configuration with other configurations such as @xmath91 or @xmath92 etc ...    also , in our calculation we have limited the space to 2 @xmath93 excitations .",
    "once we create the state with occupancy ( 4,4,2,0 ) our model space does not permit further excitations .",
    "this explains the integer occupancy .",
    "presumably if we enlarged the space to include 4 @xmath94 excitations we would no longer have the integer occupancies .",
    "it would also be of interest to study the @xmath95 states .",
    "this also explains why , as we increase @xmath4 towards 1.76 , the descent of the new band is so simple .",
    "since there is no mixing with the other configurations , the @xmath85 @xmath63 and @xmath9 states can just slip down below the @xmath32 states .",
    "the rapid descent of the @xmath85 states can be understood in terms of the nilsson model . to form the @xmath85 state ,",
    "we take two nucleons from the @xmath3 shell and put them in the nilsson orbit ( @xmath96 ) with quantum numbers ( 220 ) .",
    "this orbit comes down rapidly in energy as the nuclear deformation is increased .",
    "the nilsson one - body deformed hamiltonian can be obtained from the @xmath0 two - body interaction by replacing @xmath0 by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the quadrupole moment of the intrinsic state .",
    "in this work , we have studied the properties of the interaction @xmath99 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath4 in an extended model space which includes all @xmath33 excitations beyond the valence space . using @xmath14 as an example",
    ", we found that states that were ` accidentally ' degenerate in the @xmath3 valence space ( @xmath42 @xmath12 and @xmath16 of orbital symmetry [ 42 ] , or the @xmath100 triplets of orbital symmetries [ 411 ] and [ 33 ] ) , are no longer degenerate in the extended space .",
    "this means that the @xmath101 admixtures do more than renormalize the coupling strength of @xmath0 .",
    "the extended model space allows for @xmath85 admixtures and indeed , for sufficiently large @xmath4 ( @xmath60 ) , the @xmath63 and @xmath9 members of this new band become the new @xmath102 and @xmath12 states .",
    "we find that this band , unlike the ` normal ' ground state band for @xmath103 , has integer occupancies 4 , 4 , 2 and 0 for @xmath82 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "there is no mixing between the new @xmath85 band and the @xmath105 band .",
    "this is a special feature of the @xmath0 interaction .    on a speculative level",
    "we may argue that , for the @xmath85 band above , we should use a value of @xmath4 considerably larger than 1 .",
    "we do nt have enough model space to renormalize the two - body interaction in this band . just as the interaction between the @xmath32 states gets renormalized by the configurations in which one nucleon is excited through 2 major shells , so the interaction for the @xmath85 state would get renormalized by allowing at least one nucleon to be excited through 2 major shells . but",
    "this would be a 4 @xmath93 state which , for practical reasons , we do nt have in our model space .    we can use the @xmath0 interaction to place these @xmath85 bands at the correct energies , but we will need other components of the realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction in order to mix these bands with the @xmath105 bands . for example , we could use the dipole - dipole or octupole - octupole parts of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "alternatively one can work directly with realistic interactions .",
    "there has been much progress in large - basis shell model calculations in light nuclei .",
    "for example , there is the work of w.c .",
    "haxton and c. johnson  @xcite where they actually get the superdeformed @xmath95 state in @xmath106 at a reasonable energy , although perhaps not with the full quadrupole collectivity .",
    "there is also the work of zheng @xmath107  @xcite where up to @xmath108 excitations have been included in calculations of nuclei ranging from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "also , zamick , zheng and fayache  @xcite required multi - shell admixtures to demonstrate the ` self - weakening mechanism ' of the tensor interaction in nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , schematic interactions like @xmath0 still play a primary role in describing nuclear collectivity throughout the periodic table .",
    "they are of special importance for highly deformed intruder states .",
    "surprisingly , there have been very few studies of schematic interactions in multi - shell spaces . in the elliott @xmath18 model , momentum terms",
    "have been introduced to prevent @xmath111 admixtures in the valence space  @xcite .",
    "this has lead to great simplicities and beautiful results .",
    "there have been @xmath112 studies with @xmath0 which involve @xmath111 mixing .",
    "these studies give @xmath24 effective charge renormalizations in the valence space and also the energies of the giant quadrupole resonances , but they will not give us the highly deformed states such as the @xmath85 state that we have found here .",
    "we therefore feel that careful studies of the schematic interactions in multi - shell spaces are important , and we hope that others will agree .",
