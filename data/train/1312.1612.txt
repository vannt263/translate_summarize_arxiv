    "during the last years important efforts have been devoted to study ultra - cold fermi gases , both experimentally and theoretically ( for a review see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by means of feshbach resonance",
    "it is possible experimentally to adjust the interaction between atoms .",
    "the system can be tuned to a bcs state where fermions are weakly interacting , to the so called unitary regime where the two - body scattering length is infinite , or to form a bec condensate of bosons . theoretically , ultra - cold fermi gases have become an important testing ground for a host of many - body methods , as well as an avenue to studying new physics .",
    "the study of ultra - cold fermi gases is very intriguing , and the unitary limit became a very interesting many - body problem to solve for several reasons .",
    "these systems can be experimentally studied at very low temperatures of the order of 0.1 t@xmath1 , essentially zero temperature .",
    "they are very dilute , and their properties are independent of the form of the hamiltonian used to describe the system , the results given by any model satisfying the limits of large scattering length and small effective range must be identical .",
    "moreover these systems are very strongly interacting , methods based on perturbation theory , mean - field , or expansions of small parameters are not obviously convergent , and the calculation of the properties of the unitary fermi gas is very challenging .",
    "the properties scale with powers of the fermi momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the interparticle separation @xmath3 is approximately given by @xmath4 , and the dilute regime is guarantee by imposing @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective range of the two - body interaction . the universal regime is given when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scattering length , and the unitary limit correspond to the case of @xmath9 . in the limit of @xmath10 the only scale of the system is @xmath3 or more conveniently the fermi momentum @xmath11 .",
    "thus a natural unit for the energy if given by the fermi - gas energy @xmath12 , and there are no other free parameters .",
    "for this reason , these systems are called universal .",
    "ultra - cold fermi gases can also be realized with population imbalance , and the system can eventually exhibit different phases  @xcite where superfluid and normal phases may coexist or phase separate  @xcite , or other intriguing more exotic phases like loff or @xmath13-wave superfluidity could appear  @xcite . in the last few years",
    "a new direction of research has been undertaken : the realization of trapped two  component fermi gases with the mixture of fermions with different masses , in particular the @xmath14 mixture has been addressed  @xcite .",
    "the properties of systems with mass imbalance can be very different from the equal masses case ; for example , for majority light population the chandrasekhar ",
    "clogston limit is very small and close to zero  @xcite .",
    "then , at unitarity , the two  components fermi gas with different masses may exhibit very different properties with respect to the equal mass case  @xcite , even in the bcs limit  @xcite .",
    "several predictions for equal mass fermi gases were made possible through quantum monte carlo techniques ( qmc ) , later confirmed by experiments  @xcite .",
    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) enable accurate calculations of the ground state of strongly interacting fermions at unitarity , and to study its properties  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the unbalanced two - component fermi gases with equal masses do not exhibit a sign problem using the auxiliary field monte carlo ( afmc )  @xcite , and this permits a very accurate calculation to benchmark other many - body calculations .",
    "experiments are possible at very low temperatures of the order of fractions of @xmath15 , and then the zero temperature properties can be directly obtained from experiments .    in this paper",
    "we will review several properties calculated using qmc methods , including the exact calculation of the energy , the role of the effective range , the bcs - bec crossover , and other properties including the contact parameter and the static structure factor .",
    "[ sec : ham ]    the afmc performed on a lattice through the use of auxiliary fields does not suffer of the fermion sign problem and permits to calculate exactly the energy of the unpolarized fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "the afmc method uses a bcs wave function as a trial wave function . in this section",
    "we describe the variational wave function and the dmc method in the continuum .",
    "in our study we model the ground state of the system in the continuum using the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the number of particles with mass @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "since we want to model a system that is dilute , particles interact only in @xmath21-wave , and the potential @xmath22 is non - zero only between particles with opposite spin state or with different mass .",
    "several forms of the potential @xmath22 has been explored , and provided to be equivalent in the limit of small effective range  @xcite . in most of our studies",
    "we have used the pschl - teller already employed in several previous qmc calculations  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced mass , and the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 tune respectively the effective range @xmath27 and the scattering length @xmath8 of the interaction . for this potential ,",
    "the unitary limit corresponding to the zero - energy ground state between two particles is with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "most of the results presented in this work have been obtained by fixing @xmath30 but in several cases we considered different values to check effects due to the effective range of the potential .",
    "it is also possible to use other forms of the potential @xmath31 , and the results are universal in the limit of small effective range as we shall discuss in the next sections .",
    "the qmc calculations are performed using the jastrow - bcs form of the wave function of refs .",

    "note that if @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where the latter is the wave function describing the non interacting fermi gas in the normal phase .",
    "as @xmath51 and @xmath33 are orthogonal , we can study the fermi gases both in the superfluid and in the normal phase  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , i.e. the two  body wave function instead of the function of eq .",
    "[ eq : pairfn ] , gives lower energies .",
    "instead , in the bcs case for @xmath53 , the bcs wave function @xmath54 gives almost the same energy of @xmath51 as the pairing becomes less important to the equation of state .",
    "the polarized systems can be simulated by extending the wave function to include single - particle states for the unpaired particles  @xcite .",
    "note that the wave function previously described can not reproduce more exotic phases like loff or @xmath13-wave pairing .",
    "the jastrow @xmath55 includes a short- and a long - range part .",
    "the short - range term is given by @xmath56 where the function @xmath57 acts only between particles with different spin or mass , and it is obtained by solving the equation @xmath58 the parameter lambda is obtained by imposing the boundary condition @xmath59 , where the healing distance @xmath60 is a variational parameter , and the quenching @xmath61 is adjusted to be less than one only in the bec regime . the correct boundary conditions to the wave function",
    "are guaranteed by constraining @xmath62 where @xmath42 is the size of the simulation box , but we found that a typical good choice is given by taking @xmath63 . by solving eq .",

    "the propagation is achieved using a many - body propagator defined as @xmath72 and @xmath73    a good approximation of @xmath74 can be obtained using a trotter expansion , and iterating the above equation for small values of @xmath75 .",
    "note that for a zero - range interaction the exact two - body propagator could also be used to sample the many - body green s function  @xcite . in the case of fermions",
    "there is a sign problem that needs to be taken care .",
    "a common approach combined with the dmc method is the fixed - node approximation .",
    "the sampling of paths is restricted to regions where the trial wave function is positive , and the problem is then recasted into a bosonic problem ( without sign problem ) in a restricted subspace .",
    "this approximation results in providing an upper bound to the exact energy of the system , whose accuracy depends to the quality of the variational wave function .",
    "more details on the implementation of the vmc and dmc algorithms can be found in ref .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover has been calculated extensively over the past ten years .",
    "the unitary limit is very interesting because perturbative methods can not be applied . in addition",
    ", there are no small parameters to expand , and thus using numerical calculations is the only way to accurately explore the properties of the system .",

    "all the results correspond the case of infinite scattering length , and in the case of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the results are obtained at finite values of effective range and need to be extrapolated .",
    "results obtained using different number of particles are included in the figure .",
    "we note that finite size effects are basically absent , as using 38 , 48 or 66 fermions yields to the same energy .",
    "this fact is because the interaction is very short - range , and because pairing of the system is very strong .",
