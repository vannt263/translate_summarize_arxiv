    "the effect of quenched disorder on various condensed elastic systems is one of the fascinating problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "examples of physical systems range from domain walls in magnetic and ferroelectric materials@xcite , contact lines of of a liquid meniscus on a rough substrate@xcite , crack propagation@xcite , to vortex lattices in type ii superconductors@xcite , charge density waves ( cdw)@xcite and wigner crystals@xcite . in these systems",
    ", the competition between elastic interactions which tend to impose some long range order in the system and quenched disorder , leads to the formation of glassy phases .",
    "two broad classes of elastic systems can be distinguished : random manifold systems such as domain walls , contact lines and cracks , and periodic systems such as vortex lattices , charge density waves , and wigner crystals .",
    "the latter are characterized by a long range crystalline order in the absence of disorder and thermal fluctuations . for these systems ,",
    "a crucial question is whether a weak disorder destroys entirely the crystalline order , or whether some remnants of the underlying periodic structure remain observable .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to answer this question , was the pioneering work by larkin@xcite on vortex lattices . using a random - force model",
    ", he showed that due to the relevance of disorder in the renormalization group sense , long range order was entirely destroyed below four dimensions . above four dimensions",
    ", long range order persists as disorder becomes irrelevant .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by sham and patton for the case of a cdw with short range elasticity @xcite , where , using an imry - ma approach,@xcite they concluded that long range order was impossible in the presence of disorder below four dimensions .",
    "the problem of short range disorder in periodic systems with short ranged elasticity was revisited in refs .  .",
    "it was argued that the periodicity present in systems like cdw and vortex lattices plays a pivotal role in determining the physics of the system in the presence of disorder .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that , though the disorder is relevant below four dimensions , due to the underlying periodicity of the system a quasi long - range order persisted for dimensions between two and four .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the earlier results which predicted a total destruction of order .",
    "the resulting phase , nicknamed bragg glass phase , possesses both quasi long range order and metastability and glassy properties.@xcite it was further shown that the bragg glass phase is stable to the formation of defects .",
    "@xcite recent neutron scattering experiments on vortex lattices have furnished clear evidence for the existence of such a phase.@xcite    a complication arises in charged periodic systems due to the coulomb repulsion , which renders the elasticity non - local.@xcite this non local elasticity tends to rigidify the system , so that short range correlated disorder could be irrelevant in dimension smaller than four.@xcite for instance , within the random force model , the correlation function of the displacement in three dimensions displays a logarithmic growth indicating quasi - long range order.@xcite in fact , when the periodic structure of the cdw is properly taken into account , the growth of the displacement correlation function is even weaker , increasing only as @xmath0 with the distance @xmath1.@xcite a second complication arising from coulomb interaction is that the disorder induced by charged impurities has long - range correlations",
    ". this type of disorder can exist in certain doped cdw materials@xcite such as @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we study the effect of the competition of the non - local elasticity produced by the coulomb interaction with the long - range random potential resulting from the presence of charged impurities on the statics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : decomposition ] , we introduce a decomposition of the coulomb potential on the fourier modes of the periodic structure . with this decomposition , we show that only the long - wavelength component of the random potential i.e. , forward scattering disorder , possesses long range correlations . using statistical tilt symmetry@xcite",
    ", we deduce that due to the short ranged nature of the backward scattering terms engendered by the disorder , the dynamical properties in the presence of charged impurities are not qualitatively different from those in the presence of neutral short ranged impurities . in sec .  [",

[ sec : forward - scattering ] , we derive the static displacement correlation functions and x - ray intensity of the cdw with charged impurities and we highlight the similitude of the latter to the x - ray intensity of smectic - a liquid crystals subjected to thermal fluctuations.@xcite in sec .

    "in this section , we discuss how coulomb interactions affect elasticity and disorder in periodic systems . for a periodic elastic structure",
    ", the density can be written as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the density fluctuation arising from the long wavelength deformation of the periodic structure and @xmath5 is the average density . in the second term , the vectors @xmath6 belong to the reciprocal lattice of the perfect periodic structure , and @xmath7 represents a slowly varying are different from zero only for wavevectors much smaller than @xmath8 . ]",
    "elastic deformation of the structure.@xcite the quantities @xmath9 describe fluctuations of the density on the scale of a lattice spacing .",
    "the low energy physics of the periodic structure can be described in terms of a purely elastic hamiltonian which has the generic form for isotropic systems @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the elastic coefficient and @xmath12 is a shorthand for @xmath13 .",
    "this form can easily be generalized to anisotropic systems .",
    "well known examples of charged periodic structures are the wigner crystal,@xcite charged colloidal crystals,@xcite and the charge density waves.@xcite in many charged systems , unscreened coulomb interactions are present : @xmath14 and strongly affect the elasticity and dispersion of the compression modes of the system . moreover , in the presence of charged impurities , the original charge density on the lattice interacts with the charge impurity yielding : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the impurity density . using the decomposition of the density  ( [ density ] ) ,",
    "we now show that the coulomb interactions fundamentally modify only the long wavelength components of the elasticity and of the disorder energy .    to better handle the periodicity of the elastic structure , it is convenient to use the decomposition of the coulomb interaction in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath17 . in three dimensions ,",
    "this decomposition reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicates that the integral is restricted to the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath21 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : coulomb ] ) , the interaction term @xmath22 can be rewritten as : @xmath23 note that due to the slow variation of @xmath7 , terms involving the oscillatory factors @xmath24 can be dropped from the interaction .",

    "clearly , the non - oscillating component of the coulomb potential remains long - ranged and tends to rigidify the system .",
    "it now remains to be seen whether the oscillating parts of the coulomb interaction specified by @xmath34 for @xmath6 are long - ranged or not .",
    "we first note that the above trick of replacing the integration over the brillouin zone by a gaussian integral over the entire space is not applicable anymore , as it would introduce a spurious integration over a region where @xmath35 .",
    "this would result in an ( incorrect ) @xmath36 behavior of @xmath37 . to obtain a correct estimate for @xmath38",
    "we replace the integral over the brillouin zone by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an indefinitely derivable function with a compact support contained in the first brillouin zone ( see app .  [",
    "app : decomp - coulomb ] for an explicit form of @xmath40 ) . would decay as @xmath41 with an oscillating prefactor .",
    "the same oscillation would be also obtained for a short ranged potential , and is only a consequence of the hard cutoff . ] obviously , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 is also an indefinitely differentiable function of compact support .",
    "a well - known theorem@xcite then shows that the fourier transform of @xmath43 is indefinitely differentiable and for @xmath44 is @xmath45 for any @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that the function @xmath47 is short ranged . incorporating the above results in eq.([eq : coulombenergy ] )",
    ", we see that while the non oscillating part of the coulomb interaction modifies the long wavelength behavior of the elasticity , rendering it non - local , the short ranged nature of the oscillatory terms merely renormalizes the elastic coefficients .",
    "this is explicitly shown in app .",

    "this implies that the backward scattering terms induced by disorder are short - ranged and the treatment of these terms within the replica or the martin - siggia - rose@xcite methods is identical to the case of neutral or screened impurities .",
    "however , the @xmath56 component @xmath57 manifests power law decay of the forward scattering correlations .",
    "this term however can be gauged out by the statistical tilt symmetry@xcite , and affects mainly the static properties of the periodic system . typically , in periodic systems with both short range disorder and local elasticity , the contribution of the forward scattering disorder can be neglected and it is the backward scattering that induces collective pinning and bragg glass features like a quasi order in the static correlation functions . here",
    ", we have shown that even in the case of long range disorder , the backward scattering terms behave essentially like their short ranged ( neutral impurities ) counterparts .",
    "however , the effect of the forward scattering terms on the correlation functions has to be studied carefully . in the next section ,",
    "we show that in the case of charged impurities in a charge density wave system , the forward scattering term strongly modifies the static correlation .",
