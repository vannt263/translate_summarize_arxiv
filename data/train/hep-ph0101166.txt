    "in hadron physics , the isospin symmetry or charge symmetry@xcite is broken by inequality of the light quark masses , especially @xmath6 , and electromagnetic interaction of hadrons .",
    "this breaking of isospin symmetry induces various measurable physics effects such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 mixing , @xmath9 decay , etc .",
    "it is common knowledge that the effects of isospin breaking can be omittd in the isospin conservation processes .",
    "however , this argument is not always right . the purpose of this letter is to show that a large isospin breaking effect is in isospin conservation decay @xmath0 ( so - called hidden isospin symmetry breaking effect ) .",
    "thus the real branching ratio for this decay should be much larger than datum cited by pdg-2000@xcite and charged mode .",
    "the anomalous - like radiative decays of light flavour vector mesons have been observed by several group : the branching ratio for charged @xmath10 is @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath12 and @xmath1 decays were first obtained in refs.@xcite by using the data of @xmath13 collider in neutral detector , but the triangle anomaly contribution of qcd was ignored in their analysis .",
    "_ has reanalyzed the @xmath12 and @xmath1 decay to a pseudoscalar meson plus a photon via taking into account the triangle anomaly contribution@xcite .",
    "the authors use two models ( @xmath14 and @xmath15)@xcite to fit data .",
    "it is a bit surprising that they found two local minima for both two model fits , one with @xmath16 ( solution a ) and another one with @xmath17 ( solution b ) . to see table 1 , where phase @xmath18 of vector mesons is defined via @xmath19 cross section ( equation ( 1 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "although the solution a has smaller @xmath20 , and the phase difference @xmath21 is found around @xmath22 in the solution a , close to expectation from the quark model ( @xmath23 ) , the @xmath12 branching ratio is much larger than expected from the charged mode or from su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "thus the authors took the solution b as final result for agreeing with isospin symmetry .",
    "however , this conclusion is incorrect . in this paper",
    "let us see what happens there .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we first give the formula of the transition amplitude for @xmath24 .",

    "the transition matrix element for vector mesons decay to a pion and a photon is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are polarized vector of vector mesons and photon respectively . at the large @xmath30 limit and chiral limit ,",
    "if we ignore possible contribution from resonance exchange , the exact isospin symmetry implies @xmath31 where the superscript @xmath32 denotes absence of the resonance exchange . a complete consideration for @xmath12 and @xmath33 decays should include the contribution from the following resonance exchange , @xmath34 where the momentum - dependent @xmath35 mixing amplitude @xmath36 is defined in the following effective lagrangian .",
    "the relations in equation  ( [ 3 ] ) holds more generally . in the other words , the couplings @xmath37 and @xmath38 can include corrections beyond large @xmath30 limit and chiral limit . meanwhile , the relation  ( [ 2 ] ) will be broken , but this breaking is slight .",
    "this point can be checked by using datum of @xmath39 decay and @xmath40 decay if we believe @xmath41",
    ".    it must be point out that the equation  ( [ 3 ] ) is a non - perurbative results instead of a perturbative expression . in the rest of this section",
    "we will prove it by two independent methods : effective field theory approach and mixed propagator approach , respectively .",

    "explicitly , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be written as follows @xmath49 several remarks are related to lagrangian  ( [ a2 ] ) :    1 .   focusing on any low energy effective theory",
