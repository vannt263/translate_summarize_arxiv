    "understanding the nature of mass outflow in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been an area of extensive recent research activity .",
    "the uv and x - ray spectral properties of such outflows and their overall physical properties have been detailed by crenshaw , kraemer , & george ( 2003 ) .",
    "to summarize , the ubiquity of blue - shifted absorption among seyfert galaxies indicates that the global covering factors of the absorbers must be high .",
    "the total mass in the outflows can exceed the mass of gas in the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass outflow rates are on the same order as the accretion rates required to fuel the supermassive black holes that power agn . hence , determining the nature of these outflows is critical to understanding the structure and evolution of agn .",
    "however the origin of the outflows , e.g. an accretion disk ( konigl & kartje 1994 ) or the putative torus ( krolik & kriss 1995 , 2001 ) , and the physical means by which they are accelerated , e.g. thermal winds ( krolik & begelman 1986 ) , radiation pressure ( murray et al . 1995 ) , or magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows ( bottorff , korista , & shlosman 2000 ) , remain uncertain .",
    "ngc 4151 ( @xmath6 km s@xmath2 ) was the first seyfert galaxy to show intrinsic absorption .",
    "oke & sargent ( 1968 ) found non - stellar he  i @xmath73889 and anderson & kraft ( 1969 ) detected h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 self - absorption .",
    "these lines were blue - shifted with respect to the host galaxy , indicating mass outflow .",
    "observations in the uv obtained with the _ iue _ ( boksenberg et al .",
    "1978 ) and far - uv using the hopkins ultraviolet telesocope ( hut ; kriss et al . , 1992 , 1995 ) revealed absorption lines from a wide range of ionization states , including fine - structure and metastable lines .",
    "the intrinsic lines were found to vary in response to the uv continuum ( bromage et al .",
    "1985 ) , suggesting ionic column density changes resulting from changes in the ionization state of the absorbers .",
    "monitoring of ngc 4151 in the far - uv with hut ( kriss et al .",
    "1995 ) and the _ orbiting and retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometers - shuttle pallet satellite ii _ mission ( espey et al . 1998 ) also showed evidence for short timescale variations in absorption due to changes in ionization .",
    "early x - ray spectra revealed the presence of a large column of absorbing gas ( barr et al .",
    "1977 ; holt et al .",
    "1980 ) , which subsequent observations revealed to be ionized ( yaqoob , warwick , & pounds 1989 ; george et al . 1998 ) . as with the uv absorption ,",
    "the x - ray absorption is highly variable ( george et al .",
    "1998 ; and references therein ) , but the changes are not always correlated with the x - ray continuum flux and may indicate transverse motion of the gas across the line of sight ( weaver et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in the _ hubble space telescope / hst",
    "_ survey of intrinsic uv absorption in seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , ngc 4151 stood out as a unique object .",
    "it is one of the few objects whose spectra that show mg  ii absorption , and it is the only one that showed strong metastable c  iii * @xmath7 1175 absorption , until recent detection of a weak c  iii * absorption line in ngc 3783 ( gabel et al .",
    "one possible reason for the complexity of the intrinsic absorption in ngc 4151 is the fact that we are viewing the black hole / accretion disk system at a relatively high inclination of @xmath0 45  with respect to the accretion disk ( evans et al . 1993 ; das et al . 2005 ) , and are likely detecting material close to the densest part of the outflow .",
    "the implication is that this material can not be detected in absorption if the agn is viewed more face - on .    the first high - resolution ( @xmath0 15 km s@xmath2 ) uv spectra obtained by weymann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) aboard _ hst _ revealed six major kinematic components of c  iv and mg  ii absorption , which were stable over the period 19921996 . following this",
    ", we obtained an _",
    "hst_/space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) gto spectrum in 1999 july ( kraemer et al . 2001 ; hereafter k01 ) .",
    "these spectra revealed that the kinematic components detected by weymann et al .",
    "were still present , although the strongest kinematic components , d and e using the nomenclature of weymann et al . , were broad and we were unable to separate them . also , we found complex line - of sight covering factors to include either unocculted regions in our direct view to the nuclear emission sources , or light that is filling in the absorption troughs due to an extended scatterer . ] ( @xmath4 ) in the broad d+e component .",
    "based on the relative depths of individual members of doublets and multiplets , different ions in this component were found to have different covering factors : the strong high - ionization and doublets had @xmath10 0.9 , the and doublets yielded @xmath110.85 and 0.62 , respectively , and the many metastable lines indicated even lower covering factors . from our photoionization modeling analysis , we argued that the complex , low ionization absorption arose in dense gas , within 0.03 pc of the central source .",
    "the presence of these low ionization lines was a consequence of the relatively low continuum state during this observation , as originally suggested by bromage et al .",
    "however , the lack of contemporaneous x - ray observations prevented us from fully constraining the physical state and geometry of the circumnuclear absorbers .    in order to better characterize the absorbers , we obtained contemporaneous _ fuse _ , _",

    "chandra_/high energy transmission grating spectrometer(hetgs ) spectra in 2002 may ( see next section ) . in kraemer et al .",
    "2005 ( hereafter paper i ) , we presented our analysis of the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "to summarize , we were able to model the intrinsic x - ray absorption using five distinct components ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the h - like mg , si , and s lines were consistent with the presence of a highly ionized component , x - high , which was not detected in the uv spectra .",
    "the bulk of the soft x - ray absorption is associated with the uv kinematic component d@xmath3e . based on our preliminary analysis of the uv absorption",
    ", we found evidence for three subcomponents associated with d@xmath3e .",
    "the saturated o  vi , n  v , and c  iv lines have @xmath0 10% residual flux in the deepest part of their troughs . we identified this component , d@xmath3ea , as the source of the inner - shell lines of s , si and mg detected in the hetg spectrum .",
    "the *  @xmath71175 absorption , arising from the @xmath12 metastable levels , over this range of velocity shows a higher residual flux ( @xmath0 20% ) , hence , we added a second component , d@xmath3eb . finally , the doublet indicated the presence of a third component , d@xmath3ec , with a much lower covering factor ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a fifth component of x - ray absorption was identified with uv kinematic component e@xmath14 .    in paper",
    "i , we also analyzed the 2000 march 3 _ chandra_/hetgs observation of ngc 4151 .",
    "we found that the 2 - 10 kev continuum flux was a factor of @xmath0 2 lower than in 2002 and that the soft x - ray continuum was much more heavily absorbed .",
    "although higher soft x - ray opacity would be a consequence of the drop in ionization of the absorbers , due to the weaker ionizing flux , in order to fit the spectrum we required an additional column of gas , which we associated with component d@xmath3ea , in which case it must cover the continuum source and the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "this column must have moved out of our line - of - sight in the time between the two observations , which requires a transverse velocity , while , here , we correctly use the diameter . ]",
    "@xmath15 km s@xmath2 .",
    "based on our photoionization models , we found that x - high could not be accelerated via radiation pressure or as part of a thermal wind .",
    "although the other components could be radiatively driven , the overlap in velocities of x - high and the components of d@xmath3e suggests a common mechanism .",
    "we suggested that the most likely means for driving the outflow is by an mhd wind arising from the accretion disk .",
    "interestingly , a disk origin would provide a natural mechanism for the observed transverse bulk motion : i.e. , rotation .    in the present study",
    ", we have used the parameters determined in paper i as the initial model inputs , subject to modest adjustments in order to refine the fit to the uv absorption , with the main goal being to more tightly constrain the radial distances of the absorbers .",
    "we also track the changes in the uv absorption over the period from 1997 - 2002 to examine the effects of the response to the ionizing continuum and/or bulk motion .",
    "we obtained new uv and x - ray spectra of the nucleus of ngc  4151 with the _",

    "observations are described in paper i. for comparison , we retrieved all previous stis echelle and _ fuse _ spectra of ngc  4151 from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) ; the details of the observations are listed in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "most of the stis echelle observations come from a stis key project ( j. hutchings , pi ) ; only the first set of these , from 1999 july 19 , have been published ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2000 ; k01 ) .",
    "the stis echelle observations used a 02 @xmath16 02 aperture , whereas the _ fuse _",
    "observations used a 30@xmath17 @xmath16 30@xmath17 ( `` lwrs '' ) aperture ; the larger aperture has little effect except to include more emission from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "tables 2 and 3 show that we have 6 epochs of stis e140 m observations , 4 epochs of _ fuse _ observations , and a smaller number of stis echelle observations in the longer wavelength regions .",
    "the velocity resolution of the uv spectra ranges from 7 to 15 km s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we reduced the stis spectra using the idl software developed at nasa s goddard space flight center for the stis instrument definition team .",
    "the data reduction included a procedure to remove the background light from each order using a scattered light model .",
    "the individual orders in each echelle spectrum were spliced together in the regions of overlap .",
    "we processed the _ fuse _ data with version 2.2.3 of the standard calibration pipeline , calfuse , which extracts spectra for each of the eight combinations of channels ( sic1 , sic2 , lif1 , lif2 ) and detector segments ( a and b ) .",
    "the channel / segments with overlapping wavelength coverage with the lif1a spectrum were scaled to match its flux .",
    "all spectra were then co - added by weighting each channel / segment by its effective area , using the effective area versus wavelength functions given by blair et al .",
    "we compared galactic lines in the _ fuse _ and stis spectra to place them on the same wavelength scale . due to non - linear offsets in the _ fuse _ wavelengths ,",
    "local shifts were measured and applied individually to small spectral regions containing the intrinsic absorption features . mean residual fluxes measured in the cores of saturated galactic lines are consistent with zero within the noise ( i.e. , standard deviation of the fluxes ) in the troughs of these lines , indicating accurate background removal .",
    "to place the high - resolution spectra into context , we retrieved for comparison all of the previous low - resolution spectra of ngc  4151 that contain the 1350 continuum region .",
    "this includes spectra obtained by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) , _ the hopkins ultraviolet telescope _",
    "( _ hut _ ) , and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on _ hst_. we measured continuum fluxes by averaging the points in a bin centered at 1350   ( observed frame ) with a width of 30  , and determined the one - sigma flux errors from the standard deviations .",
    "for the _ iue _ spectra , this method overestimates the uncertainties ( clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) , and we therefore scaled them by a factor of 0.5 so that on average observations taken on the same day agree to within the quoted errors .",
    "figure 1 gives the uv continuum light curve of ngc 4151 , which spans a @xmath024-year time period .",
    "the light curve shows the long - term decline and rise of the continuum flux during the span of _ iue _ observations , and an apparent long - term decline in recent years ( although this trend is highly undersampled , since the loss of _ iue _ ) .",
    "superimposed on the long - term trends are more rapid variations captured by intensive monitoring , such as the continuous monitoring campaign around jd 2,449,300 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the last six points are stis echelle observations obtained at moderate to low flux states compared to ngc  4151 s previous behavior .",
    "several stis observations were obtained at very low continuum fluxes , including an all - time low of f@xmath18(1350 ) @xmath19 1.4 ( @xmath200.6 ) x 10@xmath21 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath22 @xmath2 on 2001 april 14 ( jd 2,452,014 ) .",
    "the broad emission lines tend to get very weak at these low continuum states , but faint broad wings in the c  iv profiles indicate that they never fully disappear .",
    "we note that the first and last stis echelle observations were obtained at very similar continuum flux levels , which is important for our later discussions .",
    "in figure 2 , we show the stis echelle spectra of ngc  4151 in the c  iv region , along with a stis g140 m spectrum ( @xmath7/@xmath23 @xmath5 15,000 ) obtained in a high state on 1997 may 15 ( hutchings et al .",

    "also identified a narrow absorption feature ( e@xmath14 ) in the low - ionization lines that was not detected in the high - ionization lines .",

    "we also identified a broad transient component ( d@xmath14 ) in c  iv and n  v that appears blueward of d@xmath3e . in k01",
    ", we give radial velocity centroids and widths for all of the kinematic components in the 1999 stis echelle spectra .",
    "we also give models of each intrinsic component based on its measured ionic column densities .",
    "a model is characterized by an ionization parameter where @xmath24 is the radial distance of the absorber and @xmath25 , or the number of ionizing photons s@xmath2 emitted by a source of luminosity @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , hydrogen column density ( @xmath28 @xmath19 @xmath29 @xmath3 @xmath30 , in units of @xmath22 ) , and hydrogen number density ( @xmath31 , in units of @xmath32 ) ; the latter was determined from numerous absorption lines arising from fine - structure levels above ground as well as metastable levels in the case of d@xmath3e .    in this paper , we concentrate on the components that are intrinsic to the agn in ngc  4151 and are clearly identified in all spectra : a , c , d@xmath3e , and e@xmath14 .",
    "the 2002 observations have the highest signal - to - noise ratios of all of the stis echelle spectra due to the moderate flux levels and long exposure times , and we use these observations to identify a few more lines than were originally detected in the 1999 spectra . for each of the above kinematic components",
    ", we have also measured the equivalent width ( ew ) and radial - velocity centroid of each detected line , since these measurements provide the simplest and most sensitive method of characterizing variations in the absorption lines .",
    "we note that equivalent - width variations can result from changes in ionic column density and/or covering factor of the background emission ; we explore these issues further in subsequent sections .",
    "no significant changes were detected in radial - velocity centroids , except as discussed below for component d@xmath3e .    for component",
    "a , we identified lines in the 1999 spectra ( including several fine structure lines ) from h  i , c  ii , c  iv , mg  ii , si  ii , si  iii , si  iv , and fe  ii . in the 2002 spectra , we also detect al ii @xmath71671 and al iii @xmath331855 , 1863 , as well as c iii  @xmath7977 and n iii  @xmath7989 in the _ fuse _ spectrum . in k01 , we noted a decrease in the ews of the si  ii and mg  ii lines between ghrs observations on 1994 october 28 and 1996 november 3 , which we attributed to transverse motion of low - ionization gas across the blr .",
    "figure 3 gives the stis ews of three ( medium , low , and high ionization ) lines from component a as a function of time , along with the continuum light curve .",
    "there is no strong evidence for variability in any of the lines since the 1999 observations , even if we consider only the points with small errors , corresponding to the highest continuum fluxes ( i.e. , the first , fourth , and sixth points ) .",
    "thus , our model for component a in 1999 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 10@xmath36 @xmath22 , @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath32 ) is still valid for the later stis observations .    for component",
    "c , we detect the same lines in the 2002 spectra that we identified in the 1999 spectra , from h  i , c  ii , c  iv , mg  ii , si  ii , si  iii , and si  iv ; we detected no fine - structure lines .",
    "lines from c iii and n  iii are detected in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "figure 4 shows that there is no evidence for ew variations in component c , as was the case for observations prior to 1999 .",
    "our previous model for this component ( @xmath39 , @xmath35 10@xmath40 @xmath22 , @xmath41 10 @xmath32 ) is still valid for all observations .    for the broad d@xmath3e component , we detect most of the lines in the 2002 spectra that we saw in the 1999 spectra , which are due to h  i , c  ii , c  iii , c  iv , n  v , mg  ii , al  iii , si  ii , si  iii , si  iv , s  ii and fe  ii .",
    "however , we do not detect o  i and ni  ii in the 2002 spectra .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum exhibits lines from additional ions , s iii , s iv , s  vi , c iii , n iii , p v , and o vi . in both the 1999 and 2002 spectra",
    ", we detect the metastable c  iii @xmath71175 lines and fe  ii lines ( weakly present in 2002 ) from levels as high as 4.1 ev above the ground state , indicating high densities .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the high - ionization c  iv line does not show strong ew variations , although there is some evidence for slight variations in the residual emission in the troughs .",
    "the lack of strong variations in the high - ionization lines ( c  iv , n  v , si  iv ) is likely due to the fact that they are highly saturated .",
    "the low - ionization species ( e.g. , si ii , fe  ii ) show strong variations in their ews and we have attributed the variations between 1997 and 1999 to changes in the ionizing continuum ( k01 ) . however , comparison of the 1999 and 2002 observations reveal a more complicated story ; the continuum fluxes are about the same , but the low - ionization lines have decreased greatly in ew , as can be seen in the si ii  lines in figure 2 .",
    "figure 5 shows the equivalent width variations of one high - ionization and two low - ionization ( one fine - structure ) lines from d@xmath3e .",
    "given the errors , there is no strong evidence for variations in c  iv or other high - ionization lines .",
    "the equivalent widths of the low - ionization lines are strongly anti - correlated with continuum flux for the first five observations , indicating that ionizing continuum variations are the dominant source of variability .",
    "however , the last observation , in 2002 , shows a strong drop in the ews , despite a similar continuum level as the first observation in 1999 .",
    "this holds true for all of the low - ionization species that have creation ionization potentials less than 19 ev ( corresponding to al iii ) , including the metastable fe ii lines .",
    "this decrease in ew could be due to a change in total column density ( @xmath28 ) and/or covering factor for the low - ionization gas ; either one requires transverse motion across the blr over a period of time @xmath42 13 months .",
    "the low ionization lines also show a shift in their radial - velocity centroids between 1999 and 2002 , from @xmath1490 km s@xmath2 to @xmath1280 km s@xmath2 relative to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy , as demonstrated by the si ii lines in figure 2 .",
    "the most likely source of this shift is that d@xmath3e is composed of several kinematic subcomponents that are blended together , and one or more of the subcomponents at higher velocities have diminished or even disappeared in the 2002 spectra .",
    "this possibility is discussed in more detail later , after we present new photoionization models of the d@xmath3e component .    for component e@xmath14",
    ", we identified only low - ionization ( including fine - structure ) lines in the 1999 spectra , from h  i , c  ii , o  i , mg  ii , si  ii , and fe  ii . in the 2002 spectra",
    ", we also detect al ii @xmath71671 , al iii @xmath331855 , 1863 , ni ii @xmath71371 , mn ii @xmath72576 , s ii , and metastable fe  ii lines from levels @xmath43 1.1 ev above ground ( e.g. , uv multiplets 62 and 63 ) . we had predicted the latter would be present , based on our estimates of the density of this component ( @xmath44 10@xmath45 @xmath32 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum also shows lines from s iii , s iv , fe iii and metastable si iii ( 6.2 ev above ground ) . in k01 , we found that the strengths of the si  ii and mg  ii lines increased between 1994 october 28 and 1999 july 19 .",
    "figure 6 shows that the ews of the low - ionization lines in this component have continued to increase .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise for spectra obtained in low flux states does not allow accurate measurement of the lines from this component .",
    "however , given the similar continuum fluxes for the first and last echelle observations , it is clear that the source of the absorption variations can not be ionization changes alone , indicating that transverse motion is important .",
    "we present new photoionization models of e@xmath14 in the next section .    in the 1999 spectra",
    ", component d@xmath46 was identified via the presence of broad n  v , c  iv , and si  iv absorption ( k01 ) . in figure 7 , we compare the 1999 and 2002 stis echelle spectra in the region near c  iv . in 2002 , there still appears to be a flattening of the profile in the velocities spanned by d@xmath46 , although this is less evident in other epochs ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the n  v profile shows a similar effect .",
    "however , it is also clear that the underlying emission - line profile was quite different during these two observations , which hampers a direct comparison of the absorption",
    ". therefore , while we conclude that d@xmath46 was likely present in 2002 , we can not accurately determine ionic column densities due to the difficulty in deconvolving the effects of changes in the underlying emission and depth of the absorption .",
    "as discussed in paper i , there is evidence for at least three different regions comprising the d+e absorption . here",
    ", we detail how covering factor constraints derived from the 2002 may _ fuse _ and stis spectra were used to isolate the different regions .",
    "first , many lines , including the doublets of the lithium - like cno ions and lyman lines show deep troughs from @xmath1200 to @xmath1700 km s@xmath2 , with some filling by unocculted nlr emission ( see figure 8a ) .",
    "all these lines have residual normalized fluxes @xmath47 , giving a lower limit on @xmath4 @xmath0 0.9 , consistent with k01 .",
    "a number of other lines , including  @xmath7 991 , and  @xmath33933,944 , show similar residual fluxes ( see figures 8a and 8b ) , but the deepest parts of their profiles range from 0 to @xmath1500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "each of these lines are heavily saturated , with lower limits to their column densities @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath22 . the offset in velocity may be evidence of the different contributions from components d and e to the composite profile , in which case it appears that e may be more heavily saturated",
    ". however , these components strongly blend together to form a smooth profile , therefore it is impossible to deconvolve them .",
    "although  @xmath7977 spans a broader range in velocity than ( see figure 8b ) , it appears that the blue - wing is affected by the deep absorption from component c , hence the absorption profile from d@xmath3e for these two ions is likely similar .",
    "based on our analysis of the x - ray absorption ( paper i ) , we associate all of these absorption lines with the sub - component d@xmath3ea , which is the source of the broad - band soft x - ray absorption .    the strong *  @xmath71175 absorption complex shows a velocity structure similar to , but a smaller residual flux ( @xmath48 0.2 ) , which we cited in paper i as evidence for the existence of sub - component d@xmath3eb .",
    "the * complex is comprised of six transitions arising from the three metastable levels ( j=0,1,2 ) at @xmath50 6.2 ev above the ground state .",
    "the populations of the metastable levels , and thus strength of the feature , depend strongly on electron temperature and density ( we will revisit this in section 5 ) .",
    "the  @xmath331394,1403 doublet , which also appears to be saturated , shows a residual flux that ranges between that of the lithium - like cno lines and the lines associated with d@xmath3eb ( see figure 8c ) , which suggests that there are contributions from both sub - components .",
    "the @xmath71118,1128 doublet exhibits unsaturated , unblended absorption in component d+e , providing a good diagnostic for covering factor and ionic column density .",
    "it also has negligible emission - line flux underlying the absorption , and thus will not be affected by complex background emission geometry ( see ganguly et al .",
    "1999 ; gabel et al .",
    "we used a @xmath51 analysis to derive the covering factor and optical depth @xmath52 from the doublet , comparing the observed intensity for each line with the absorption equation that gives normalized intensity as a function of these parameters : @xmath53 this method is needed to assess uncertainties in the doublet solution , since spectral noise is known to bias the solution to underestimates of @xmath4 and overestimates of @xmath52 ( see appendix of gabel et al .",

    "this is in contrast with the lines we have associated with d@xmath3ea and d@xmath3eb , which clearly have a larger covering factor based on their low residual fluxes .",

    "in fact , a model for d@xmath3eb using the continuum transmitted through this version of d@xmath3ea also predicts the measured column densities for these ions .    the model for d@xmath3ea for the 1999 july epoch predicts a si  iv column of 10@xmath139 @xmath22 , hence d@xmath3ea would dominate the si  iv profile ( see table 6 ) .",
    "indeed , the si  iv profile was broader in the spectra taken in 1999 july and 2000 march , than in 2002 may , consistent with an extremely saturated line .",
    "also , the si  iv profile is still quite broad during 2000 november , at which time the uv continuum was a factor of @xmath0 1.5 higher than during 1999 and 2002 . to test",
    "if the broad profile detected in 2000 november was consistent with the same total column density that was present in 1999 , we generated a model for d@xmath3ea with n@xmath140 @xmath22 ( see paper i ) and an ionizing flux increased by factor of 1.5 over the value used in modeling the 2002 data .",
    "the model predicts n@xmath141 @xmath22 , which would produce a broad si  iv profile and is consistent with the presence of the large column absorber during the 2000 november epoch .    however , there is one problem with this scenario . in both the 1999 july and 2000 november spectra ,",
    "the residual flux in the troughs of si  iv over the velocities spanned by d@xmath3ea was @xmath0 0.2 , similar to that observed in 2002 , while the covering factor of d@xmath3ea is @xmath0 0.9 .",
    "although the column density of d@xmath3ea could have been somewhat smaller than we suggested in paper i , particularly if the lowest ionization lines observed in 1999 formed in d@xmath3eb , weak si  iv absorption is incompatible with the high soft x - ray opacity detected in 2000 march .",
    "one possibility is that the extra column present in the earlier data had a somewhat smaller covering fraction than that of d@xmath3ea , hence may not be identical with the sub - component responsible for the deep li - like cno absorption lines .",
    "as discussed above , the column density of the soft - x - ray absorber , which we associated with component d@xmath3ea in paper i , decreased dramatically between 2000 march and 2002 may .",
    "it is plausible that the low - ionization lines detected in stis spectra prior to 2002 arise either in d@xmath3ea or in one of the associated screened components , most likely d@xmath3eb .",
    "therefore , the history of this additional absorption can be traced by examining the changes in low ionization absorption lines , such as si  ii @xmath71527 and si  ii * @xmath71533 , during the period between 1999 july and 2002 may .",
    "as we noted in section 4 , over much of this time the ews of these lines were anti - correlated with the uv continuum flux , which indicated that 1 ) the additional column of gas was present and 2 ) its ionization state changed in response to variations in the ionizing flux .",
    "there was a dramatic drop in ew between 2001 april and 2002 may , which is best explained by bulk motion of gas out of our line - of - sight , consistent with the x - ray analysis .",
    "given the evidence for a very low covering factor for the si  ii lines in 2002 may ( section 4.1 ) , a likely cause for the large decrease in ew is a change in covering factor of the background emission since 2001 april . using the si  ii @xmath7 1260 line ,",
    "which is likely saturated , we find that c@xmath142 was @xmath00.73 in 2001 and @xmath00.20 in 2002 for the absorber responsible for si  ii ( likely d+ed ) .",
    "this suggests that the absorber was in the process of moving out of our line of sight to the blr in 2002 .",
    "since the size of the absorber is roughly proportional to the square root of the covering factor , the absorber moved by about 0.4 times the size of the blr ( 6.8 lt days ; metzroth , onken , & peterson [ 2006 ] ) .",
    "this results in a transverse velocity of v@xmath143 @xmath5 2100 km s@xmath2 , which is on the same order as our lower limit of 2500 km s@xmath2 for d+ea .",
    "these velocities are somewhat higher than the fwhm of the c  iv ilr line , but fall within the velocity range of the line profile .",
    "this , the transverse velocities are consistent with an origin in the ilr and the rotational velocities at this distance . however , the connection between the low ionization absorption present up until 2001 april and the strong x - ray absorption detected in 2000 march , which results from an additional column of relatively highly ionized gas , remains unclear .",
    "regardless of the details of the process , the most recent changes in ew of the uv lines and the drop in opacity of the x - ray absorption can only be explained by bulk motion of the absorbing gas .",
    "this means that the outflow can not be purely radial and , indeed , that the dominant component of velocity is transverse to our line - of - sight .",
    "the direction of the transverse velocity remains unknown , but is linked to the origin and evolution of the outflow .",
    "given that the kinematic studies suggest that the accretion disk is inclined 45@xmath144 with respect to our line - of - sight , the transverse motion of the gas could be directed along a similarly inclined path towards either the accretion disk or its rotation axis .",
    "the latter would require that the disk were self - gravitating ( paczynski 1978 ) or , at least , that the local gravitational potential exceed that of the central point mass , either of which are unlikely ( e.g. , yu , lu , & kauffmann 2005 ) . the former is suggestive of the spin - up of magnetic field lines by which jets are accelerated ( e.g. blandford 1983 ) . however , the simplest possibility , which we suggested in paper i , is that the transverse component is rotational , consistent with an origin in a disk - driven wind . in this case",
    ", the tranverse velocity would be on the same order as the rotational velocity at the launch pad of the flow .",
    "however , possible problem with this scenario is that it requires d@xmath3ea to originate at a much smaller radial distance ( @xmath0 10@xmath145 cm ) than that of the putative ilr , although the ilr c  iv is clearly covered by this absorber .",
    "based on our modeling of the uv and x - ray absorbers , we have developed a set of constraints on the physical conditions and evolution of the absorbers .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "\\1 ) the bulk of the soft x - ray absorption and the strong li - like cno absorption lines associated with kinematic component d@xmath3e can be modeled as forming in a single component , d@xmath3ea .",
    "there are three additional lower - ionization sub - components of d@xmath3e , which do not contribute significantly to the x - ray absorption .",
    "\\2 ) our deconvolution of the c  iv profile indicates that at least some of the absorbing gas associated with d@xmath3e must lie outside the ilr .",
    "if the ilr emission arises at a radial distance of 0.1 pc , from our derived values for @xmath27 we can constrain the densities of the absorbers . using these densities , and",
    "the predicted ionic columns from the metastable states of c  iii when these densities are input to the models , we were able to fit the observed c  iii * profile , hence our assumptions are self - consistent .",
    "\\3 ) the ews of the low ionization lines associated with d@xmath3e have varied over the period from 1999 july to 2002 may . before 2001 april",
    ", these changes were correlated with variations in the uv continuum , as expected for changes in ionic columns due to the response of the gas to the ionizing continuum . however , between 2001 april and 2002 may , the drop in the ews of these lines are more suggestive of bulk motion , as does the change in the x - ray opacity between between 2000 march and 2002 may ( paper i ) .",
    "the weakness of the metastable fe  ii lines in 2002 , compared to 1999 when ngc 4151 was in a similar flux state , must also be due to bulk motion .",
    "however , it is uncertain how the column densities of the individual sub - components of d@xmath3e have varied .",
    "\\4 ) we have obtained constraints on the transverse velocity , @xmath146 @xmath5 2100 km s@xmath2 , for the low ionization absorption associated with d@xmath3e , which we dubbed d@xmath3ed .",
    "while this is roughly comparable to the lower limit derived for d@xmath3ea in paper i , the connection between these sub - components and the origin of the strong low ionization absorption present in the 1999 july stis spectra is not clear .    in summary , while we have modified some of the details of the models used in paper i , and included additional components of low - ionization gas , the uv analysis has confirmed our two principal conclusions .",
    "first , the bulk of the absorption in ngc 4151 is much closer to the central source than in other seyferts , e.g. ngc 3783 ( gabel et al .",
    "2005b ) and , second , that the variations in the absorption are due to both ionization and bulk motion .",
    "the latter could be a consequence of an origin within a rotating disk , which is consistent with our suggestion that the outflow is mhd - driven .",
    "an interesting characteristic of the absorbers which is yet to be addressed is the origin of low covering factor sub - components , such as d@xmath147c .",
    "although one can envision denser , lower ionization knots embedded in a more tenuous flow , the dynamics of such a system are not straightforward .",
    "one major problem is that there are multiple components , characterized by different @xmath27 s and , thus different force multipliers ( see paper i and references therein ) , with the same radial velocities .",
    "while this may be consistent with an mhd flow , it requires that the low ionization knots are coupled to the flow in such a way that they are not radiatively driven through the more tenuous gas .",
