    "dislocation core structures and peierls barriers are known to change with applied stress @xcite , making it difficult to relate such simulations to experimental reality . as a result , while the kink mechanism is well established in dislocation theory there is a sparsity of md data on the parameters controlling kink motion , without which it is impossible to predict the velocity - stress relationship of the host dislocation for realistic stresses .",
    "+ to circumvent the problem of kink nucleation in md we use boundary conditions on the simulation supercell which enforce the existence of an isolated kink on the dislocation line .",

    "this is likely to be the case , for example , when a high energy kink pair annihilates or is created during the simulation .",

    "the slices contain one atomic plane normal to the dislocation lines .",
    "the radius of the cylinder was enlarged , using the periodic boundary conditions if necessary to generate atomic coordinates outside the supercell , until the excess energy of the dislocation core in the slice reached a constant asymptotic value .",
