    "how proteins fold into their native 3-dimensional structure remains an intriguing question .",
    "given the vast number of unfolded protein conformations , cyrus levinthal argued in 1968 @xcite that proteins are guided to their native structure by a sequence of folding intermediates . in the following decades , experimentalists focused on detecting and characterizing metastable intermediates with a variety of methods @xcite . while such folding intermediates continue to be of considerable interest @xcite , the view that proteins have to fold in sequential pathways from intermediate to intermediate , now known as ` old view ' @xcite , changed in the 90s when statistical - mechanical models demonstrated that fast and efficient folding can also be achieved on funnel energy landscapes that are smoothly biased towards the native state and do not exhibit metastable intermediates @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic proteins of this ` new view ' are two - state proteins , first discovered in 1991 @xcite .",
    "two - state proteins fold from the denatured state to the native state without experimentally detectable intermediate states . since then",
    ", many small - single domain proteins have been shown to fold in two - state kinetics @xcite .",
    "the folding dynamics of two - state proteins is thought to be dominated by a single free - energy barrier , or transition state , between the denatured and native state .",
    "this transition state of the protein folding reaction is an instable , short - lived state and can not be observed directly . instead",
    ", the dynamics of two - state proteins is often explored via mutational analysis @xcite .",
    "in such an analysis , a large number of mostly single - residue mutants of a protein is generated .",
    "for each mutant , the effect of the mutation on the folding dynamics is usually quantified by its @xmath0-value @xcite @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the folding rate for the wildtype protein , @xmath4 is the folding rate for the mutant protein , and @xmath5 is the change of the protein stability induced by the mutation .",
    "the stability @xmath6 of a protein is the free energy difference between the denatured state @xmath7 and the native state @xmath8 . in classical transition - state theory , the folding rate of a two - state protein is proportional to @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the free energy difference from the denatured state to the transition state .",
    "it is usually assumed that the prefactor of this proportionality relation does not depend on the mutation . in this notation , @xmath0-values have the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mutation - induced change of the free - energy barrier @xmath10 .",
    "the mutational @xmath0-value data for a protein provide indirect information on its folding dynamics and , therefore , have attracted considerable theoretical interest .",
    "the central question is : which transition transition - state structures and free - energy perturbations are consistent with the experimentally measured @xmath0-values ? in this article , we model @xmath0-values from detailed mutational analyses @xcite of two small @xmath1-sheet proteins , the fbp and pin ww domains .",
    "the native structure of these proteins consists of two hairpins forming a three - stranded sheet @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the design principles @xcite and folding kinetics @xcite of ww domains and other three - stranded @xmath1-sheet proteins have been studied extensively .",
    "because of their small size and abundance as protein domains , ww domains are important model systems for understanding @xmath1-sheet folding and stability .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with atomistic models are computationally demanding and in general do not allow direct calculations of folding rates and @xmath0-values . with additional assumptions on transition states or @xmath0-values ,",
    "transition - state conformations have been extracted from md unfolding trajectories at elevated temperatures @xcite or constructed from md simulations that use @xmath0-values as restraints @xcite . however , for a small , designed three - stranded @xmath1-sheet protein , beta3s , transition - state conformations @xcite and @xmath0-values @xcite have been more rigorously determined from extensive equilibrium folding - unfolding md simulations .",
    "the native structure of beta3s is similar to the structure of ww domains , with two @xmath1-haipins forming an antiparallel three - stranded @xmath1-sheet .",
    "rao et al .",
    "@xcite performed four md simulations of beta3s at the temperature 330 k with a total length 12.6 @xmath13s , and observed 72 folding and 73 unfolding events . by identifying clusters of structurally similar conformations that have the probability @xmath14 to fold @xcite , and the same probability to unfold , rao et al .",
    "obtained a transition - state ensemble for beta3s that is ",
    "characterized by the presence of one of the two native hairpins formed while the rest of the peptide is mainly unstructured \" @xcite .",
    "the two @xmath1-hairpins of beta3s thus appear to be cooperative substructures that are either fully structured or unstructured in the transition state .    here",
    ", we show that a statistical - mechanical model with a beta3s - like transition - state ensemble in which either hairpin 1 or hairpin 2 are formed leads to an overall consistent interpretation of experimental @xmath0-values for the fbp and pin ww domains . in this model , mutations can either affect hairpin 1 , hairpin 2 , or the small hydrophobic core of the ww domains , which is not yet structured in the transition state .",
    "the general form of @xmath0-values in this model is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability , or fraction , of the transition - state conformation in which hairpin 1 is formed , and @xmath17 is the probability of the transition - state conformation with hairpin 2 formed .",
    "the mutation - induced changes of the free energy difference between the two transition - state conformations and the denatured state are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the model has just two structural parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath20 , which are obtained from a comparison with the experimental data .",
    "different @xmath0-values for different mutations simply arise from different ` free - energy signatures ' @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 of the mutations .",
    "in particular , the model reproduces the negative @xmath0-value for the mutation l36a of the fbp ww domain .",
    "the mutation destabilizes the native state ( @xmath22 ) , but stabilizes hairpin 2 ( @xmath23 ) , according to calculations with the empirical force field fold - x @xcite .",
    "this leads to a negative @xmath0-value in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) since @xmath18 equals 0 for this mutation . in general , ` nonclassical ' @xmath0-values , i.e.  @xmath0-values that are negative or larger than 1 , are obtained in the model if mutations stabilize some structural elements , but destabilize others .",
    "the mutation l36a of the fbp ww domain , for example , stabilizes hairpin 2 , but destabilizes the hydrophobic core .",
    "nonclassical @xmath0-values have been difficult to interpret in the traditional interpretation . in this interpretation ,",
    "a @xmath0-value is taken to indicate the degree of structure formation of the mutated residue in the transition - state ensemble t @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-value of 1 is interpreted to indicate that the residue has a native - like structure in t , since the mutation shifts the free energy of the transition state t by the same amount as the free energy of the native state n. a @xmath0-value of 0 is interpreted to indicate that the residue is as unstructured in t as in the denatured state d , since the mutation does not shift the free - energy difference between these two states .",
    "@xmath0-values between 0 and 1 are typically taken to indicate partial native - like structure in t. for a protein with @xmath24 residues , the traditional interpretation thus implies @xmath24 structural parameters , the degrees of structure formation of all residues .",
    "in contrast , the model presented here has just a single independent parameter , the relative degree to which hairpin 1 and 2 are populated in t. since degrees of structure formation have to be between 0 ( ` denatured - like ' ) and 1 ( ` native - like ' ) , the traditional interpretation can not explain nonclassical @xmath0-values smaller than 0 or larger than 1 . in the present model , nonclassical @xmath0-values arise from substructural free - changes contributions of different sign",
    "( see above ) .    we have recently suggested a related , novel model for @xmath0-values of mutations in @xmath25-helices of a protein @xcite .",
    "the model is based on cooperative helix formation and on splitting mutation - induced free energy changes in helices into secondary and tertiary terms @xcite .",
    "the two structural model parameters are the degrees of secondary and tertiary structure formation of the helix in the transition state . for several well - characterized helices",
    "@xcite , fitting these two parameters to mutational data leads to a consistent , structural interpretation of the @xmath0-values .",
    "the general conclusion from our helix model and the model for small @xmath1-sheet proteins presented here is that a consistent structural interpretation of @xmath0-values ( i ) requires to split up mutation - induced stability changes into free - energy contributions from different substructural elements of a protein , and ( ii ) can be obtained with few parameters that characterize the degree of structure formation of cooperative elements such as @xmath25-helices and @xmath1-hairpins in the transition - state ensemble .",
    "the central assumption of our model is that each of the hairpins is either fully formed or not formed in the transition - state ensemble of the protein .",
    "the model has then four states : the denatured state @xmath7 in which none of the hairpins is formed , a transition - state conformation in which only hairpin 1 is formed , a transition - state conformation in which only hairpin 2 is formed , and the native state with both hairpins formed .",
    "the energy landscape can be characterized by three free - energy differences : the free - energy difference @xmath26 of the native state and the free - energy differences @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the transition - state conformations with respect to the denatured state ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "for other transitions , i.e. for the direct transition from the denatured state to the native state , and vice versa , the transition rates are zero . here",

    ", the folding rate is given by @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 .",
    "the folding rate @xmath44 simply is the sum of the rates for the two possible folding routes on which either hairpin 1 or hairpin 2 forms first .",
    "the factor @xmath45 in the equation above arises because a molecule , after reaching one of the barrier states @xmath46 or @xmath47 , either proceeds to @xmath8 or returns to @xmath7 , with almost equal probability .",

    "<S> we obtain good agreement with the experimental data ( i ) by splitting up the mutation - induced free - energy changes into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the proteins , and ( ii ) by fitting a single parameter , the relative degree to which hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state . </S>",
