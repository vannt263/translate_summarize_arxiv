    "nowadays , there still exist some movement phenomena of celestial body which ca nt be explained by current gravitational theory . therefore , some scientists doubt the universality of current gravitational theory , and then bring forward the modified gravitational theory and hypothesis of dark matter to explain the phenomena of abnormal rotation velocity of galaxy and the associated missing mass etc .",
    "the hypothesis of dark matter believes that , there exist not only various gleamy ordinary matters , but also one kind of mysterious matter which exerts the gravitational pull , but neither emits nor absorbs light @xcite .",
    "this kind of matter is known as dark matter , which owns mass and has effect on ordinary matter movements @xcite .",
    "most scientists believe in its existence and multiformity in the universe .",
    "a new insight on the problem of the dark matter can be given by the concept of the octonion space .",
    "the understanding of time and space experiences an evolutional period @xcite . in 17th century , i. newton thought the time and space in nature were separate .",
    "and the time and space were both independent of matter .",

    "we believe that electromagnetic and gravitational interactions are different , equal and relative . and they possess different and four - dimensional spacetimes respectively .",
    "these two types of different and four - dimensional spacetimes are equal and independent , and can not be superposed directly .",
    "the viewpoint can be summarized as spacetime equality postulation , that is : each fundamental interaction possesses its own spacetime , and all these spacetimes are equal .    according to previous research results and the spacetime equality postulation ,",
    "the electromagnetic and gravitational interactions can be described by their four - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "based on the conception of space verticality etc .",
    ", two types of four - dimensional spacetimes can be united into an eight - dimensional spacetime . in eight - dimensional spacetime , the electromagnetic interaction and gravitational interaction can be equally described .",
    "so the characteristics of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions can be described by a single eight - dimensional spacetime uniformly .",
    "the paper modifies the gravitational theory of ordinary matter and dark matter , and draws some conclusions which are consistent with the maxwellian electromagnetic theory and the newtonian gravitational theory . a few prediction associated with movement feature of dark matter",

    "when the particle _ q _ is in the force - balance status , @xmath50 so its equations in @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions are respectively    @xmath51    it makes out that field source ( @xmath48 ) of dark matter field has direct influence on the movement of field sources ( @xmath52 ) of familiar electromagnetic field.    when the sum of last three terms in above each equation equals to 0 , and @xmath53 , the force - balance equations of charged particle , which are in the circumference movement in electromagnetic field and modified gravitational field , can be achieved from above    @xmath54    the above equations show that , as the parts of inertia force , the terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 will affect the planar circumference movement of charged particle .",

    "contrarily , in the milky way galaxy , when the spatial distribution of solar system mass and field energy density are variable , or when the angular momentum of the solar system is variable along the direction perpendicular to the galactic equator plane , the centrifugal force of solar system will change , and then the movement of solar system will betray the familiar gravitational theory .",
    "if the change of mass , energy density and momentum lead to counteract the certain parts of centrifugal force , it will result in the revolution speed increase to generate enough centrifugal force to balance gravitational interaction of the milky way galaxy .",
