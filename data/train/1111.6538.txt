    "anisotropic flow  @xcite is one of the most important probes of ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . while early studies  @xcite focused on elliptic flow generated by the almond shape of the interaction region in non - central collisions , most of the recent activity concerns the effect of fluctuations in the initial geometry  @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations result in fluctuations of elliptic flow  @xcite , and also in new types of flow , such as triangular flow  @xcite and higher harmonics .",
    "these new flow observables have been recently measured at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "flow phenomena are best modeled with ideal  @xcite or viscous  @xcite hydrodynamics .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamics  @xcite provides a natural way of studying flow fluctuations : one typically supplies a set of initial conditions , then evolves these initial conditions through ideal @xcite or viscous  @xcite hydrodynamics , then computes particle emission at the end .",
    "observables are finally averaged over a large number of initial conditions , much in the same way as they are averaged over events in an actual experiment .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in these hydrodynamic models is the initial conditions  @xcite  that is , the state of the system after which it has sufficiently thermalized or isotropized for the hydrodynamic description to be valid .",
    "several models of initial geometry fluctuations have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the usual procedure is to choose one or two of these simple models for the initial conditions and calculate the resulting flow observables .",
    "significant progress has been made recently by simultaneously comparing to several of the newly - measured flow observables . with this approach",
    ", hydrodynamic calculations can be used to rule out a particular model of initial conditions if results do not match experimental data  @xcite .",
    "but it does not tell us _",
    "why _ a particular model fails . in order to constrain the initial state directly from data",
    ", we need to identify which properties of the initial state determine a given observable .",
    "these constraints can then provide valuable guidance in the construction of better , more sophisticated models of the early - time dynamics .",
    "it is well known that elliptic flow is largely determined by the participant eccentricity  @xcite .",
    "teaney and yan  @xcite have introduced a cumulant expansion of the initial density profile , in which the participant eccentricity is only the first term in an infinite series , and they have suggested that the hydrodynamic response may be improved by adding higher - order terms , but to our knowledge their suggestion has never been checked quantitatively .",
    "other expansions have also been suggested  @xcite .",
    "as for triangular flow , @xmath10 , symmetry considerations have been used to argue that it should be created by an initial triangularity @xmath11 , but several definitions of @xmath11 are in use @xcite and it has never been investigated which is a better predictor of @xmath10 . finally , it has been shown that higher harmonics  @xcite @xmath5 and @xmath6 are in general _ not _ proportional to the corresponding @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a possible better estimator was recently suggested @xcite , but it has not been checked quantitatively .    the goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the hydrodynamic response to initial fluctuations .",
    "we carry out event - by - event ideal hydrodynamic calculations with realistic initial conditions and then quantitatively compare the final values of @xmath0 with estimates derived from the initial density profile .",
    "we are thus able to systematically determine the best estimators of flow observables @xmath0 , @xmath14 25 from the initial transverse density profile .",
    "in hydrodynamics , the momentum distribution of particles at the end of the evolution is completely determined by initial conditions .",
    "current models of initial conditions predict the system at early times to consist of flux tubes or other string - like structures that are extended longitudinally  @xcite , with an approximate boost invariance at mid - rapidity .",
    "most models also predict that the initial transverse flow , if any , is small  @xcite ( except for possible fluctuations of the initial flow velocity  @xcite ) . under these approximations ,",
    "any observable is a completely deterministic functional of the transverse energy density profile @xmath15 .",
    "this density in turn can be completely characterized by a set of complex moments  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes an average value over the transverse plane weighted by @xmath15 .",
    "small values of the first index @xmath18 correspond to small powers of @xmath19 in a two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath15 , and thus describe large - scale structure , while moments with larger values are more sensitive to small - scale structure .",
    "the second index indicates the rotational symmetry of each moment .",
    "if the system has @xmath20 symmetry , all odd moments ( i.e. , with @xmath21 odd ) vanish . in a symmetric heavy - ion collision , the symmetry between target and projectile implies an approximate @xmath20 symmetry in a centered coordinate system defined by @xmath22 ( used throughout this article ) .",
    "this symmetry is only broken by quantum fluctuations in the wavefunction of incoming nuclei  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "odd moments are typically small relative to even moments .",
    "similarly , central heavy - ion collisions are rotationally symmetric except for fluctuations , so that all moments with @xmath23 are small . for semi - central or peripheral collisions , however , the interaction area is almond shaped  @xcite , resulting in sizable moments in the 2nd fourier harmonic @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the familiar participant eccentricity @xmath25 and participant plane @xmath26 are defined by  @xcite @xmath27 the value of @xmath25 is typically @xmath28 in a semicentral heavy - ion collision : anisotropies are small , and so it is natural to expect that the hydrodynamic response can be ordered into a taylor s series .",
    "higher - order even harmonics are smaller : the fourth - order anisotropy @xmath29 is typically of order @xmath30  @xcite , so that it can be treated in practice as a higher order term in a taylor series expansion .",
    "any observable can generally be written as a function of moments of @xmath31 . in this paper , we focus on anisotropic flow , @xmath0 , which , along with the event - plane angle @xmath32 , is defined by @xmath33 here @xmath17 denotes an average over the distribution of particle momenta in one event . in hydrodynamics , this is a smooth ( boosted thermal ) probability distribution . in a real - world collision , @xmath0 and @xmath32 must be inferred from a finite sample of particles .",
    "the resulting statistical error makes an event - by - event determination of @xmath0 impossible in current experiments  only event - averaged quantities are reliable . in theoretical calculations",
    ", however , we can accurately determine @xmath0 and @xmath32 in every event in order to study precisely how they depend on initial conditions .",
    "the symmetries of @xmath0 restrict what combinations of moments of the initial distribution it can depend on .",
    "for example , to first order in anisotropies , the rotational symmetry of @xmath0 implies that it is a linear combination of moments in the same harmonic : @xmath34 where the coefficients @xmath35 are ( dimensionful ) functions of ( the infinite set of ) rotationally symmetric moments @xmath36 .",
    "the conventional eccentricity scaling of elliptic flow , @xmath37 , amounts to truncating the series to the first term , @xmath38 .",
    "i.e. , the statement that @xmath39 is a statement that the hydrodynamic response is sensitive only to the large - scale structure of the initial density distribution , with the response to small - scale structure damped in comparison .",
    "this statement has not been quantitatively tested until now .",
    "teaney and yan  @xcite have suggested that including a higher - order term @xmath40 in addition to the lowest order may improve the accuracy ( actually , they listed cumulants instead of moments , but it is equivalent ) .",
    "this conjecture will be checked quantitatively in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] .    in this work",
    "we will use the following notation for the dimensionless eccentricity @xmath41 and the corresponding orientation angle @xmath42 in a given event : @xmath43 and we use the shorthand notations @xmath44 , @xmath45 . if @xmath46 is even and positive , the numerator of eq .",

    ", they write @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are solely determined by the initial density profile .",
    "the first harmonics are given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "strictly speaking , this expansion scheme is of obvious relevance only for a conformal equation of state and for a particular initial density profile falling more slowly at large @xmath55 than realistic profiles .",
    "nevertheless , we find it instructive to test how this expansion compares with conventional eccentricity scaling with realistic initial conditions .",
    "finally , one can also consider moments of the entropy density profile instead of energy density , which we also test in the following .",
    "the goal here is to determine which moment or combination of moments serve as a best estimator for flow observables @xmath0 with @xmath14 25 .",
    "we shall see in particular that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not well described by the leading - order expansion ( [ leadingorder ] ) and require nonlinear terms , which are also constrained by symmetry .",
    "note that symmetry considerations alone exclude a linear mixing between the second and third harmonics , as proposed in ref .",
    "the goal of this work is to test to what extent @xmath0 and @xmath32 are correlated with quantities derived from the initial transverse density distribution , such as @xmath1 and @xmath56 .",
    "previously , the correlation of anisotropic flow with the initial geometry has been studied by plotting the distribution of @xmath57  @xcite or by displaying a scatter plot of @xmath0 versus @xmath1  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we carry out a global analysis which studies both aspects simultaneously and quantitatively .    for a given event",
    ", we write @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an unknown proportionality constant .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side defines the estimate for @xmath0 from the initial eccentricity , and the last term @xmath60 is the difference between the calculated flow and the proposed estimator , or the error in the estimate ( note that @xmath60 is complex ) .",
    "no known estimator can perfectly predict @xmath0 in every event ( for example , two events with the same triangularity can be constructed to have very different triangular flow  @xcite ) .",
    "the best estimator , then , should be defined as the one that minimizes the mean square error @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes an average over events in a centrality class .",

    "<S> we investigate how the initial geometry of a heavy - ion collision is transformed into final flow observables by solving event - by - event ideal hydrodynamics with realistic fluctuating initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we study quantitatively to what extent anisotropic flow ( @xmath0 ) is determined by the initial eccentricity @xmath1 for a set of realistic simulations , and we discuss which definition of @xmath1 gives the best estimator of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the common practice of using an @xmath2 weight in the definition of @xmath1 in general results in a poorer predictor of @xmath0 than when using @xmath3 weight , for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we similarly study the importance of additional properties of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show that in order to correctly predict @xmath5 and @xmath6 for non - central collisions , one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it makes no difference whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity , or in a single slice at @xmath9 , nor is it important whether one uses an energy or entropy density weight . </S>",
    "<S> this knowledge will be important for making a more direct link between experimental observables and hydrodynamic initial conditions , the latter being poorly constrained at present . </S>"
