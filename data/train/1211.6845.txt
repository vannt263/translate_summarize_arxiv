    "the latter is defined by a 2-form @xmath10 and a @xmath11-form @xmath12 induced on @xmath8 , and @xmath7 is determined by their exterior derivatives .",

    "the metric @xmath16 on @xmath9 is found by solving a system of evolution equations that hitchin @xcite interpreted as hamilton s equations relative to a symplectic structure defined ( roughly speaking ) on the space parametrising the pairs @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest instance of this construction occurs when @xmath8 is a so - called _ nearly - khler _ space , in which case @xmath18 is a conical metric over @xmath8 , in accordance with a more general scheme described by br @xcite .",
    "the first explicit metrics known to have holonomy equal to @xmath3 were realized in this way .    in this paper , we are concerned with the classification of left - invariant half - flat @xmath0-structures on @xmath5 , regarded as a lie group @xmath19 , up to an obvious notation of equivalence .",
    "one of these structures is the nearly - khler one that can be found on @xmath20 , for any compact simple lie group @xmath21 , by realizing the product as the 3-symmetric space @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , we verify that this nearly - khler structure is unique amongst invariant @xmath0-structures on @xmath23 ( see proposition  [ prop : nkunique ] , that has a dynamic counterpart in proposition  [ prop : nkunique ] ) .",
    "examples of the resulting evolution equations for @xmath3-metrics have been much studied in the literature @xcite , but one of our aims is to highlight those @xmath3-metrics that arise from half - flat metrics with specific intrinsic torsion , motivated in part by the approach in @xcite .",
    "nearly - khler corresponds to gray - hervella class @xmath24 , and it turns out that a useful generalization in our half - flat context consists of those metrics of class @xmath25 ; see section  [ sec : symgrp ] . by careful choices of the coefficients in @xmath26 and @xmath27",

    "the equations ( for example in corollary  [ cor : flow ] ) have features in common with two quite different systems considered in @xcite and @xcite , but both in connection with painlev equations .",
    "a more thorough analysis of classes of solutions giving rise to @xmath3-metrics is carried out in section  [ sec : further ] . some of these exhibit the now familiar phenomenon of metrics that are asymptotically circle bundles over a cone ( `` abc metrics '' ) .",
    "all our @xmath3-metrics are of course of cohomogeneity one , and this allows us to briefly relate our approach to that of @xcite .    in the final part of the paper , we present the tip of the iceberg that represents a numerical study of hitchin s evolution equations for @xmath23 .",
    "we recover metrics that behave asymptotically locally conically when @xmath36 belongs to a fixed @xmath28-dimensional subspace .",
    "more precisely , we show empirically that the planar solutions are divided into two classes , only one of which is of type abc .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the normalization condition that asserts that @xmath10 and @xmath27 generate the same volume form , and is a worthwhile topic for further theoretical study . for the generic case",
    ", the flow solutions do not have tractable asymptotic behaviour , but again the geometry of the solution curves ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : g2sol3d ] ) is constrained by the normalization condition that defines a cubic surface in space .",

    "for example , consider the metric from the above example , assuming for simplicity that @xmath305 and @xmath310 . by @xcite , we know that the shape operator @xmath311 of the principal orbit @xmath312 satisfies the equation @xmath313 . for the given metric , we find that @xmath314 we also observe that @xmath315    in general , the ricci flat condition can now be expressed as : @xmath316 combined with another equation expressing the einstein condition for mixed directions . if we take the trace of the first equation in , and combine with the second one , we obtain the following conservation law : @xmath317    as explained in @xcite , the above system has a hamiltonian interpretation . it is this interpretation , in its lagrangian guise and phrased with the use of superpotentials , one frequently encounters in the physics literature . in this setting ,",
    "the kinetic and potential energies are given by @xmath318 these definitions agree with those in @xcite up to a multiple of @xmath319 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a relevant description of the superpotential ; in classical terms this is a solution of a time - independent hamilton - jacobi equation . in the concrete example",
    ", the superpotential @xmath320 can be viewed as a function of @xmath321 .",
    "concretely , we can take @xmath322 in terms of @xmath320 , the flow equations can then be expressed as follows : @xmath323 where @xmath324 ( assuming @xmath325 ) , @xmath326 and @xmath327 finally , we remark that the kinetic and potential terms can be expressed in the form @xmath328    as a further specialisation , let us consider the case when @xmath283 and @xmath329 , @xmath330 ; this is the nearly - khler case",
    ". then the shape operator is proportional to the identity : @xmath331 , and the kinetic and potential terms are @xmath332 respectively .",
    "so the total energy is zero @xmath333 for all @xmath334 .",
    "the superpotential is the fifth oder polynomial @xmath335    [ [ uniqueness - flowing - along - a - line . ] ] uniqueness : flowing along a line . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the case when @xmath336 , the flow equations turn out to have a unique ( admissible ) solution satisfying for which @xmath36 belongs to a fixed one - dimensional subspace .    [",
    "prop : nkunique ] assume @xmath337 is a solution of",
    ". then @xmath36 belongs to a fixed @xmath338-dimensional subspace of @xmath339 if and only if the associated @xmath3-metric is the cone metric over @xmath5 endowed with its nearly - khler structure .",
    "it is easy to see that the solution of which corresponds to the cone metric over @xmath5 ( with its nearly - khler structure ) is represented by @xmath340 so , in this case , @xmath36 indeed belongs to a fixed @xmath338-dimensional subspace of @xmath339 .",
    "conversely , let us assume we are given a solution such that @xmath341 then the system reads :    @xmath342    these equations show that there is a purely algebraic constraint to having a solution : @xmath343 where @xmath344 .",
    "uniqueness of the `` nearly - khler cone '' , as a flow solution , now follows by observing that these algebraic equations have the following set of solutions : @xmath345 the solutions with @xmath346 are not `` admissible '' whilst the remaining solutions all result in one - parameter families of pairs equivalent to .",
    "as indicated in the earlier parts of this paper , previous studies of @xmath3-metrics on @xmath218 have focused mainly on metrics with isometry group ( at least ) @xmath347 .",
    "in addition , most of the attention has been centred around solutions in @xmath145 for @xmath348 .",
    "a technique that seems effective if one is specifically looking for complete metrics is to choose the initial values of the flow equations to obtain a singular orbit at that point ( meaning , in our context , one whose stabilizer has positive dimension in @xmath349 ) .",
    "this approach was adopted in @xcite for @xmath350 holonomy . however ,",
    "this final section shifts the focus of our investigation in order to illustrate some more generic behaviour of the flow on the space of invariant half - flat structures on @xmath40 .",
    "we first look for solutions in @xmath351 for which @xmath36 takes the form @xmath352 where @xmath353 are smooth functions on an interval @xmath354 .",
    "a solution of is then uniquely specified by the quadruple @xmath355    we have solved the system for a wide range of initial conditions . a selection of solutions",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : g2sol2d ] . apart from the nearly - khler straight line ,",
    "these solutions are new .",
    "plotting the metric functions , we find that some of the new metrics have one stabilising direction when @xmath356 and no collapsing directions ( they are therefore abc metrics of the sort mentioned in connection with ) .",
    "the others have shrinking directions which cause the volume growth to slow down as shown in figure [ fig : g2sol2dvgrowth ] .",
    "more precisely , in the case @xmath357 , the normalisation forces @xmath358 , written as @xmath359 , to lie on the curve @xmath360 which has two branches separated by the line @xmath361 .",
    "one branch corresponds to positive - definite metrics , including the nearly - khler solution @xmath362 the abc metrics are those for which @xmath363 , and appear on the top left of the nearly - khler line in figure [ fig : g2sol2dqcurvea ] , in green in the coloured version .    when @xmath364 , the nearly - khler solution is excluded .",
    "nevertheless , the overall picture remains valid , meaning one branch of the normalisation curve corresponds to positive - definite metrics , and this branch itself has two half pieces , one corresponding to abc curves and one to the other solutions .    in the trace - free case , @xmath365",
    ", all solutions degenerate at a point @xmath366 .",
    "the abc solutions are `` half complete '' , meaning that away from the degeneration they are complete in one direction of time .",
    "( see @xcite for other examples of half - complete @xmath3-metrics ) .",
    "the other solutions reach another degeneracy point @xmath367 in finite time .",
    "the singularity at @xmath368 can not be resolved .",
    "in particular , it is not possible to find complete @xmath3-metrics .",
    "one way to circumvent this issue is to consider flow solutions for which @xmath97\\neq0 $ ] ; solutions of this form include the metrics discovered by brandhuber et al @xcite .",
    "now , turning to `` less symmetric '' @xmath3-metrics , we consider for solutions in @xmath351 with @xmath36 of the ( generic ) form : @xmath369 where @xmath370 are smooth functions on an interval @xmath354 .",
    "a solution of is then uniquely specified by the sextuple @xmath371    as in the case of planar solutions , we have solved the flow equations for a large number of initial conditions .",
    "in contrast with the planar case , we have not been able to find metrics with one stabilising directions as @xmath372 .",
    "we shall confine our presentation to the class of solutions with the same initial point @xmath373 as the nearly - khler solution , but with varying velocity vector @xmath374 similar to the planar case , the flow lines are governed by the normalization condition , and is replaced by the cubic surface @xmath375 the asymptotic planes corresponding to the vanishing of @xmath376 separate the surface into four hyperboloid - shaped components , and only the one with all factors negative is relevant to our study of positive - definite metrics with holonomy @xmath3 .",
    "the nearly - khler solution @xmath377 ( cf .  ) corresponds to its centre point .",
    "families of solutions are shown in figure  [ fig : g2sol3d ] which , like those in figure  [ fig : g2sol2d ] , were plotted using _ mathematica _ and the command _ ndsolve_. to obtain the curves , it was convenient to further reduce attention to the case in which @xmath378 are all negative .",
    "the corresponding subset of is now a curved triangle @xmath379 with truncated vertices . by issuing a plotting command for @xmath380",
    ", we obtained an abundant sample of mesh points to feed into as initial values .",
    "one can then regard each curve as the continuing trajectory of a particle launched towards a point of @xmath381 , which fits in close to the apex of figure  [ fig : g2sol3dqcurvea ] .",
    "all the solutions , apart from the central nearly - khler one , are new .",
    "they tend to have shrinking directions , causing the volume growth to slow down .",
    "the @xmath382 solution curves in figure  [ fig : g2sol3dqcurvea ] are plotted for the range @xmath383 since many develop singularities close to @xmath384 ( and close to @xmath385 though positive @xmath386 is not shown ) . in the coloured `` cocktail umbrella '' picture , they are separated into groups distinguished by the value of the function @xmath387 of the initial condition , with the nearly - khler line @xmath388 and its close neighbours in red .",
    "solutions resulting from one of the coordinates being positive can be short - lived in comparison to the others , leading to less coherent plots , and this is why they are absent .",
    "the view looking down the nearly - khler line from a point @xmath389 with @xmath390 is shown in figure  [ fig : g2sol3dqcurveb ] .",
    "the @xmath391 symmetry obtained by permuting the coordinates is evident .",
    "the splitting behaviour at the three `` ends '' is to some extent artificial , reflecting as it does the truncation that has resulted from our decision to restrict attention to the negative octant .",
    "the abc two - function solutions of figure  [ fig : g2sol2dqcurvea ] in the previous subsection arise when two of @xmath378 coincide and assume a common value greater than @xmath392 .",
    "the projection of these planar curves orthogonal to the nearly - khler line can be seen in figure  [ fig : g2sol3dqcurvec ] .",
    "computations confirm that , unlike the generic curves of figure  [ fig : g2sol3dqcurveb ] emanating from @xmath393 , these can be extended for all @xmath394 .",
    "in addition to the solutions in @xmath395 , we have investigated solutions in @xmath396 .",
    "regarding the asymptotic behaviour of the associated @xmath3-metrics , the overall picture appears not dissimilar to the one we have described by deforming the nearly - khler velocity . taking account also of the numerical analysis in @xcite , we conjecture that the only solutions that can be extended for @xmath397 or @xmath398 lie in a plane .",
