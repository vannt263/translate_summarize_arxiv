    "gaussian signatures could be expressed as @xmath68 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that recent analyses of the three  point function and the skewness from _ cobe _ data @xcite are also consistent with quasi  gaussian fluctuations .",
    "now let us turn to the examples .",
    "to begin with let us consider the natural inflationary scenario .",
    "first introduced in @xcite this model borrows speculative ideas from axion particle physics @xcite . here",
    "the existence of disparate mass scales leads to the explanation of why it is physically attainable to have potentials with a height many orders of magnitude below its width @xcite , as required for successful inflation where usually self coupling constants are fine  tuned to very small values .",
    "this model considers a nambu - goldstone ( n - g ) boson , as arising from a spontaneous symmetry breakdown of a global symmetry at energy scale @xmath69 , playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "assuming there is an additional explicit symmetry breaking phase at mass scale @xmath70 these particles become pseudo n - b bosons and a periodic potential due to instanton effects arises .",
    "the simple potential ( for temperatures @xmath71 ) is of the form @xmath72 $ ] .    for us",
    "this @xmath73 constitutes an axion  like model with the scales @xmath74 and @xmath75 as free parameters .",
    "it is convenient to split the parameter space into two regions . in the @xmath76 zone",
    "the whole inflationary period happens in the neighbourhood of the minimum of the potential , as may be clearly seen from the slow  rolling equation @xcite @xmath77 which is only violated near @xmath78 , and from the small value of the steepness @xmath79 for @xmath1 smaller than @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "thus by expanding @xmath73 around the minimum it is easy to see the equivalence between this potential and the quadratic one @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "we have already studied the latter in ref.@xcite and we will add nothing else here . on the other hand ,",
    "let us consider the other regime , where @xmath83 .",
    "reheating temperature considerations place a lower limit on the width @xmath74 of the potential . for typical values of the model parameters involved",
    ", a temperature @xmath84gev is attained .",
    "gut baryogenesis via the usual out  of  equilibrium decay of x  bosons necessitates instead roughly @xmath85gev ( the mass of the gauge bosons ) for successful reheating @xcite .",
    "thus the final temperature is not high enough to create them from the thermal bath .",
    "baryon - violating decays of the field and its products could be an alternative to generate the observed asymmetry if taking place at @xmath86gev , the electroweak scale .",
    "this yields the constraint @xmath87 @xcite , implying @xmath88 ( see below ) .",
    "attractive features of this model include the possibility of having a density fluctuation spectrum with extra power on large scales .",
    "actually for @xmath89 the spectral index may be accurately expressed as @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this tilt in the spectrum as well as the negligible gravitational wave mode contribution to the cmb anisotropy might lead to important implications for large scale structure.@xcite    let us take now @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath92 .",
    "slow  rolling requirements are satisfied provided the accelerated expansion ends by @xmath93 , very near the minimum of the potential .",
    "furthermore , the slow  rolling solution of the field equations yields the value of the scalar field 60 e - foldings before the end of inflation @xmath94 where we approximated @xmath78 .",
    "+ we find @xmath95                              ( 1-\\sin^2(\\phi_{60 } / 2 f ) ) ^{-1 }                              \\simeq 2 ( m_p / f)^2 $ ] .",
    "two years of data by _ cobe _ @xcite are not yet enough to separately constrain the amplitude of the quadrupole and the spectral index .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis yields @xmath96\\mu k$ ] . by making use of eq.([quad ] ) for the _ rms _ quadrupole , _ cobe _ results constrain the value of the free parameter @xmath97 .",
    "we find @xmath98 , a rather small signal for the non ",

    "we will now study a class of universe models where the scale factor increases at a rate intermediate between power ",
    "law inflation as produced by a scalar field with exponential potential @xcite  and the standard de sitter inflation . in ref.@xcite",
    "barrow shows that it is possible to parameterize these solutions by an equation of state with pressure @xmath99 and energy density @xmath100 related by @xmath101 , with @xmath102 and @xmath103 constants .",
    "the standard perfect fluid relation is recovered for @xmath104 leading to the @xmath105 ( @xmath106 constant during inflation ) solution of the dynamical equations when the spatial curvature @xmath107 and @xmath108 , while @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "this non  linear equation of state ( and consequently the two limiting accelerated expansion behaviours ) can be derived from a scalar field with potential @xmath111 . on the other hand for @xmath112",
    "we have @xmath113 ( intermediate inflation ) with @xmath114 and @xmath115 and again in this last case it is possible to mimic the matter source with that produced by a scalar field @xmath1 , this time with potential [ intpot ] v ( ) = 8 a^2(+ 4)^2 ( m_p)^2 + ( ) ^- ( 6 - ^2 m_p^2 8 ^ -2 ) with @xmath116 .",
    "the equations of motion for the field in a @xmath107 friedmann universe may be expressed by @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "exact solutions for these equations with the potential of eq.([intpot ] ) are of the form @xcite : @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "solutions are found for all @xmath121 but only for @xmath122 we get @xmath123 ( i.e. inflation ) .",
    "in addition @xmath124 is required to ensure that the accelerated expansion occurs while the scalar field rolls ( not necessarily slowly ) down the potential , in the region to the right of the maximum ( as it is generally the case ) .    from the full potential ( [ intpot ] ) we may compute the value of the dimensionless skewness @xmath0 ( for convenience we will be taking the field @xmath1 normalized in planck mass units from here on ) [ 11 ] s = 0.17 q , evaluated at @xmath61 . in eq.([11 ] ) we took @xmath125 ( from eq.([skew ] ) ) , that is the case for the specific examples we discuss below . a plot of this quantity as a function of @xmath126 ( the value of the squared of the field beyond the minimum allowed ) for different values of @xmath127 is given in fig .",
    "1 . note that both positive and negative values of @xmath0 are therefore allowed just by modifying the choice of @xmath127 .",
    "another generic feature is the rapid decrease of the non ",
    "gaussian amplitude for increasing values of the field beyond @xmath128 ( i.e. @xmath129 ) .",
    "clearly this is because for large @xmath1 we approach the slow ",
    "roll region where the steepness becomes increasingly small .",
    "similar calculations may be done for the spectral index .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath29 calculated from our potential ( [ intpot ] ) is complicated and not very illuminating .",
    "2 illustrates the variation of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath130 ( i.e. the scale dependence of the spectral index ) for different values of the parameter @xmath127 .",
    "these two figures show that for acceptable values of the spectral index very small amplitudes for @xmath0 are generally predicted . as an example we consider @xmath131 .",
    "this ansatz yields a negative @xmath0 being @xmath132 the value of the field that maximizes @xmath133 . we show in fig .",
    "3 the form of the inflaton potential ( [ intpot ] ) for this particular @xmath127 .",
    "we see that for the scales that exit the hubble radius 60 e ",
    "foldings before the end of inflation @xcite the value of the inflaton , @xmath50 , is located in the steep region beyond the maximum of the potential .",
    "the value of the spectral index associated with this choice of @xmath127 is @xmath134 ( a 3% below the first  order result @xmath135 ) .",
    "this value in excess of unity for the scales under consideration yields a spectrum with less power on large scales ( compared with a harrison ",
    "zeldovich one ) making the long wave length gravitational wave contribution to the estimated quadrupole subdominant .",
    "the slow - roll parameters for this scale are @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "while the first two are smaller than one , @xmath57 is not and so can not be considered an expansion variable on the same footing as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath57 ( and therefore non negligible ) in eq.([12 ] ) are those not included in the second  order analysis done for the first time in ref.@xcite . taking the _ cobe _ normalization we finally get @xmath139 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath140 .",
    "now the potential falls to zero as a power  law much more rapidly than in the previous case . if we take @xmath92 we see from fig .",
    "2 that @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) corresponding to the slow  rolling region of the potential @xcite . for the parameters we find the following values : @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 . from these",
    "we see that the first  order result ( @xmath146 ) is 7 % above the full second  order one . in this case",
    "we get @xmath147 .",
    "now gravitational waves contribute substantially to the detected quadrupole .",
    "actually we have @xmath148 @xcite ( while we would have had @xmath149 up to first order ) .",
    "thus the estimated quadrupole should be multiplied by a factor @xmath150 to correctly account for the tensor mode contribution .",
    "finally we get @xmath151 .",
    "we are interested in considering a potential of the form [ polypot ] v ( ) = a ( 14 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 3 + 8 ^ 2 ) + v_0 where for convenience @xmath1 is written in plack mass units and @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath127 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "translation invariance allows us to omit the linear @xmath1 contribution to @xmath154 .",
    "a detailed analysis of a potential of the form ( [ polypot ] ) was done by hodges et al .",
    "parameter space diagrams were constructed and regions where non  scale invariance was expected were isolated . here",
    "we will just summarize what is necessary for our study .",
    "taking @xmath155 ensures that @xmath156 is the global minimum and therefore @xmath157 .",
    "if we further require @xmath158 then no false vacua are present .",
    "scalar curvature perturbations are conveniently expressed in terms of the gauge  invariant variable @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum associated with it , assuming slow  roll evolution of the scalar field in the relevant region of the potential , is given by @xmath160 evaluated at horizon crossing time .",
    "equivalently @xmath161 which suggests that regions of the parameter space where the slope of the potential goes through a minimum or a maximum will be of interest as far as broken scale invariance is concerned .",
    "the presence of these extrema in @xmath162 is guaranteed by taking @xmath163 , with @xmath164 in order for the scalar field to roll down the potential from the right .",
    "we will thus concentrate our study in the vicinity of an inflection point @xmath165 , i.e. near the curve @xmath166 ( but still @xmath167 ) . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath168 and the number of e - foldings taking place in the region of approximately constant slope about @xmath165 is given by @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath170 as the number required for achieving sufficient inflation , the interesting parameters ought to lie close to the curve @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "we find @xmath173 $ ] where , again , we are normalizing the field in planck mass units , @xmath172 and we have evaluated the field for @xmath174 .",
    "variation of @xmath153 in the allowed range results in both positive and negative values for @xmath0 .",
    "clearly @xmath175 yields @xmath176 .",
    "although in this region of the parameter space the value of @xmath153 that makes @xmath177 maximal corresponds to @xmath178 , this value conflicts with the requirement @xmath179 for the existence of an inflection point . we take instead @xmath180 which makes @xmath177 the largest possible one and at the same time agrees within a few percent with approximating @xmath181 .",
    "then @xmath182 .",
    "this guarantees we are effectively exploring the neighbourhood of the curve @xmath166 in parameter space . a plot of the potential for these particular values is given in fig .",
    "4 . the slow  roll parameters in this case have values : @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 . by using eq.([12 ] ) we get @xmath186 .",
    "let us consider now the case where @xmath187 .",
    "this choice of potential parameters leads to @xmath188 .",
    "the non  gaussian signal gets maximized for @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "5 shows the potential in this case .",
    "note the resemblance between this form of the potential and that of the hybrid @xcite model @xmath191 for @xmath192 dominating and in the vicinity of the flat region . in that case",
    "the same sign of the dimensionless skewness @xcite and blue spectra @xcite , @xmath193 , were predicted . for this value of @xmath153",
    "we get : @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "we get @xmath197 .    we can now use eq.([quad ] ) for the quadrupole to find the overall normalization constant @xmath152 of the potential .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "@xcite get a best fit @xmath198 for @xmath29 fixed to one , as it is our present case to a very good approximation . thus , for @xmath180 we get @xmath199 and @xmath200 while for @xmath189 we get @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the above two values for @xmath29 show that the departure from scale invariance is actually very small ( in fact , this is because we are exploring a very narrow range of scales ) .",
    "note also the relatively large value of @xmath57 in the last case compared with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this tells us that the terms proportional to @xmath57 are non negligible in general . also",
    "the rather small amplitudes for @xmath0 agree with previous numerical analyses @xcite in which adherence to the correct level of anisotropies in the cmb radiation under the simplest assumptions of inflation , like slow  rolling down with potential ( [ polypot ] ) , practically precludes any observable non ",

    "in the present paper we have presented explicit calculations ( in the frame of some well motivated inflationary models ) of the dimensionless skewness @xmath0 predicted for the large angular scale temperature anisotropies in the cmb radiation as well as the evaluation of the primordial spectral index of the density perturbations originating these anisotropies .",
    "these computations were performed to full second order in perturbation theory . in all three models ( even in the case of the polynomial inflaton potential where more parameters were at our disposal ) very low values for the non ",
    "gaussian signal were obtained .",
    "in fact , the explicit values for @xmath0 were found generically much smaller than the dimensionless _",
    "rms _ skewness calculated from an underlying gaussian density field and are therefore hidden by this theoretical noise , making experimental detection impossible .",
    "one may try to resort to many ",
    "field models in the hope of shifting the non  zero @xmath0 window to larger values . in this respect a potential of",
    "the form @xmath203 is likely to do well the job @xcite . in this case",
    "the resolution of a set of coupled langevin ",
    "type equations for the coarse  grained fields ( suitably smoothed over a scale larger than the hubble radius ) should be faced .",
    "in contrast to previous many  field analyses where one of the fields was assumed to dominate at a certain stage , in our case ( for the aim of computing the three ",
    "point function ) we need to make a second  order perturbative expansion in @xmath204 around the classical solutions @xmath205 but keeping @xmath206 fully dependent on all the fields .",
