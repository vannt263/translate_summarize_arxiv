    "1998 ; keel et al .",
    "these emitters have sub - galactic sizes , and are thought to be `` building blocks '' which will merge into a luminous galaxy at the present epoch .",
    "to investigate the rest - frame optical nature of these objects , we carried out low - dispersion @xmath0 spectroscopy of 53w002 , object # 18 , and # 19 using the newly commissioned instrument of the subaru telescope , oh - airglow suppression spectrograph ( ohs ; iwamuro et al .",
    "2001 ) and cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs ( cisco ; motohara et al .",
    "the resulting spectra of these objects are shown in figure 1 .",
    "both 53w002 and object # 18 show very strong [ oiii ] and h@xmath4+[n ii ] lines .",
    "the balmer jump is also detected in the continuum of 53w002 .",
    "object # 19 , which is known to be a quasar , shows a power - law continuum and a broad ( 8000 km s@xmath6 ) , strong ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath6 ; @xmath8 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath9 ) h@xmath4 line .",
    "the contribution of these lines to the broad - band flux is as high as 45% , as shown in table 1 .",
    "lccc object & & & + 53w002 & 42% & 30 & 22 + object # 18 & 32 & 45 & 11 + object # 19 & 29 & 6 & 4 +",
    "because the wavelength resolution is low ( @xmath10 ) , we deconvolved the blended h@xmath4+[n ii ] lines by multiple gaussian fitting .",
    "we then estimated the dust extinction from h@xmath4/h@xmath11 ratio , assuming smc extinction curve .",
    "the estimate of @xmath12 is 0.14 for 53w002 and 0.50 for object # 18 .    in figure 2 ,",
    "two diagrams of reddening corrected emission - line ratios are presented .",
    "one show [ nii]@xmath136583/h@xmath4 versus [ oiii]@xmath135007/h@xmath11 and the other [ oii]@xmath133727/[oiii]@xmath135007 versus [ oiii]@xmath135007/h@xmath11 .",
    "we next carried out photoionization calculation using cloudy94 ( ferland 2000 ) , and over - plotted the results on figure 2 .",
    "these results show that the emission line ratios of 53w002 are well reproduced by a cloud with electron density @xmath14 and solar metallicity , ionized by an @xmath15 power - law continuum .",
    "object # 18 seems to be not a star - forming galaxy but a type 2 agn , and its line ratios are reproduced by a cloud of solar metallicity , ionized by @xmath16 power - law continuum .    both 53w002 and object",
    "# 18 show high metallicity ( solar abundances ) .",
    "we suggest that they are produced by starburst activity during merger events with surrounding objects , for which we find evidence in our spectrum of 53w002 in the form of the balmer discontinuity at 4000 .",
