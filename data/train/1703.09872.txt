    "@xcite for two @xmath7 states in this region , so we have split the older data ( according to mass ) between a three - star @xmath9(1875 ) and a two - star @xmath9(2120 ) . \" the mass of the pdg is 1820 - 1920 mev ( 1875 mev pdg estimate ) and the width 250 @xmath10 70 mev . quoting directly from ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass is 1880 @xmath10 20 mev and the the width 200 @xmath10 70 mev .",
    "a more recent experiment @xcite agrees with these values with 1875 @xmath10 20 mev for the mass and 200 @xmath10 25 mev for the width .",
    "the most important decay modes are @xmath11 ( 15 - 25% ) , @xmath12 ( 10 - 35% ) , mostly in @xmath13-wave , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) ( 30 - 60% ) .",
    "it is interesting to recall that prior to its acceptance as a new resonance , a peak in the amplitudes was observed around 1875 mev from the study of the pseudoscalar meson - baryon decuplet interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case of strangeness @xmath16 and isospin @xmath17 ,",
    "the coupled channels @xmath18 and @xmath19 were used , and the interaction was obtained from the meson - baryon lagrangians of ref .",
    "the peak appears at the @xmath19 threshold and it was identified as a threshold effect , not a genuine resonance .",
    "one should note that the identification of threshold effects with resonances is quite common and one has a good example with the @xmath20(980 ) which is catalogued as a resonance , but it shows both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite as a cusp effect with no clear pole associated to it .    in the present paper",
    "we retake the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and include triangle mechanisms associated to the main building channels @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which lead to new channels @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "the first channel has not been measured yet , but the second channel is , together with @xmath18 the main decay channel of the resonance .",
    "an effective transition potential is constructed from the @xmath18 , @xmath19 channels to the @xmath21 and @xmath15 , and a four channel problem is then solved with a unitary coupled channel scheme , leading to a resonant peak around 1875 mev in the amplitudes from where we extract the coupling of the @xmath22 resonance to the different channels and the partial decay widths to these channels .",
    "triangle diagrams have for long been part of hadron physics , but of particular interest are those that lead to singularities in the amplitudes , known as triangle singularities .",
    "the concept and detailed study was introduced by landau @xcite , but it is precisely now , after much information on the hadron spectrum and reactions has been accumulated , that many examples of triangle singularities show up @xcite .",
    "a triangle diagram stems from a particle a decaying into @xmath23 , particle 2 decaying to @xmath24 and particles @xmath25 merging into another particle c. in some cases , when the process can occur at the classical level , a singularity appears in the corresponding feynman diagram , coleman - norton theorem @xcite , and the field theoretical amplitude becomes infinity if the intermediate particles are stable .",
    "in practice , some of these particles have a finite width and the infinity becomes a peak , with important experimental consequences .",
    "an alternative formulation to the standard method to deal with the triangle singularities is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a different method to perform the integrals and an easy and intuitive rule to determine where the singularities appear .",
    "recent examples of processes where the triangle singularities are relevant can be seen in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the latter process is isospin forbidden and results largely enhanced due to a triangle singularity involving @xmath28 followed by @xmath29 and fusion of @xmath30 to give the @xmath31 .",
    "a more recent example can be seen in the compass collaboration @xcite , associated to a new resonance  @xmath32 \" , which , as hinted in ref .",
    "@xcite and proved in refs .",
    "@xcite , comes from the @xmath33 decay of the @xmath34 , via a triangle singularity proceeding through @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "related to this is the recent interpretation of the @xmath38 resonance as a decay mode of the @xmath39 into @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is the role played by a triangle singularity in the @xmath42 reaction @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath43 , @xmath36 , @xmath44 leads to a peak in the cross section around @xmath45 mev that solved a standing problem in that reaction .",
    "similarly , the @xmath46(1810 ) is also explained as a consequence of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 merging into the @xmath50(1260 ) @xcite .",
    "other examples can be found in refs .",
    "renewed interest in the triangular singularities came from the suggestion that the narrow peak of the @xmath51 invariant mass at 4450 mev seen by the lhcb collaboration @xcite , and interpreted there as a pentaquark state , could be due to a triangle singularity with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the preferred experimental quantum number of this peak , @xmath7 , @xmath55 , the @xmath56 proceeds with @xmath57 in @xmath58-wave or @xmath59-wave and the @xmath57 threshold is exactly 4450 mev , hence , this amplitude vanishes there on shell and the suggested process can not be responsible for the observed peak .",
    "in the present work we will show that the process of the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , develops a triangle singularity precisely at the same mass of resonance and reinforces it .",
    "the other interesting finding of this work is that there can also be triangle mechanisms , which , without developing a singularity , can be very important .",
    "this is actually the case with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we shall see that because of the large strength of all the couplings involved , this process becomes even more important than the @xmath66 and leads to a sizeable partial decay width @xmath67 .",

    "the @xmath74 amplitude develops a strong peak around 1500 mev that was associated in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath6(1520 ) resonance .",
    "by contrast , this amplitude is very small around 1875 mev , as a consequence of interference of terms , and it is the @xmath75 amplitude the one that shows as a clear peak around 1875 mev . in the next subsection",

    "( [ eq : widths ] ) . actually , since we are only considering @xmath302 of the @xmath297 production in these figures , taking into account the results of eq .",

    "@xcite in which a @xmath7 resonance appears around 1875 mev from the interaction of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels . in a first step we introduced the @xmath3 channel which is produced via a triangle singularity in which @xmath2 is produced",
    ", then the @xmath113 decays to @xmath383 and finally the @xmath384 merge to produce the @xmath291 .",
    "the interesting observation is that the singularity appears at the same energy of the resonance and then it shows at the same peak and helps stabilize the resonance in the sense that even with a weaker @xmath2 interaction the singularity always appears at the same energy .",
    "the other decays channel that we introduced is the @xmath4 channel .",
    "we also used a triangle diagram to take it into account , taking the @xmath1 intermediate state , letting the @xmath114 decay to @xmath385 and then merging the two pions into a @xmath170 meson .",
    "then we retake the scheme of @xcite adding the two new channels to the original @xmath2 and @xmath1 ones , and with the four coupled channels we study again the resonance , the couplings to the different channels and its decay into these channels .",
    "we observe that the partial decay widths of the resonance to @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not large but measurable .",
    "in particular , we observed that the @xmath4 channel was much smaller than what is determined experimentally from some experiments . yet , since channel separation is done from mass distributions , we showed that due to interference with other terms , the @xmath5 mass distribution showed an important enhancement at low invariant masses from where one could extract an appreciable larger fraction of @xmath4 than one gets from the couplings , yet smaller than the experimental claims .    an important part of the work was the study of the @xmath2 .",
    "this channel is not easy to separate in an analysis because the resonance has its mass at the threshold of the channel .",
    "in fact no experiment has made claims about this channel .",
    "however , we see that the channel is very important in the building of the resonance and that taking into account the width of the resonance and the width of the @xmath113 we obtained a branching fraction of about 45% .",
    "it is clear that if this channel is omitted in the analysis , its strength can easily be attributed to another channel .",
    "so , in view of the unavoidable large strength of this channel , we suggest that modern multichannel analyses implementing unitarity in coupled channels are used to revise this resonance . there is a clear example in a related case , where the multichannel analysis provides also a sizeable contribution of a threshold channel , the @xmath386 in the case of the @xmath387 @xcite , where other analyses @xcite neglect it .",
    "the determination of the @xmath3 channel is also relevant since it will evidence the role of a triangle singularity peaking at the resonance position .",
    "yet , the discussion of the mass distributions in the @xmath388 final state showed that the mass distribution for @xmath389 had the same signature in the @xmath390 mass distribution than that coming from the @xmath391 excitation mechanisms , where the @xmath390 is not forming the @xmath114 .",
    "this is why if one wishes to determine this channel , the ideal final state should be @xmath290 not @xmath392 .",
    "the thorough work conducted here on the building up of the resonance , its decay channels and the mass distributions in the @xmath392 channel , together with the discussion above , clearly indicate that a reanalysis of this resonance to the light of the present findings should be most welcome .",
