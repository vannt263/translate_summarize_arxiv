    "roughly half of the total number of sources in the galactic plane ( @xmath290 ) have been firmly associated with high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and pulsar - wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "the latter appear to dominate the overall population of galactic tev sources ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "there is a substantial number of unidentified very high energy ( vhe ; detected above 1 tev ) sources ( @xmath220 ) , some of which have plausible multi - wavelength ( mw ) counterparts ( e.g. , nearby young pulsars ) but the associations have not been confidently established yet ( e.g. , there is no x - ray pwn , x - ray and tev emission do not correlate , offsets from pulsars are too large ) .",
    "finally , there are few ( @xmath27 ) vhe sources that belong to so - called  dark accelerators \" because they have no plausible counterparts at any other wavelength ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that these vhe sources could be relic pwne of older undetected pulsars ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the tev image of the source appears to exhibit two hot spots which , due to poor statistics , could not be definitively claimed to be two independent sources @xcite . in this paper",
    "we tentatively label these hot spots as hess j1741 - 302a and hess j1741 - 302b ( hereafter j1741a and j1741b , respectively ; see figure 1 ) .",

    "two scenarios have been put forth to describe the emission from hess j1741 - 302 , namely hadronic gamma - ray production via interaction of cosmic rays with molecular clouds in the region , or a pwn associated with the offset , yet relatively young and powerful , pulsar b173730 @xcite",

    "the extent of suzaku j1741 ( @xmath2 @xmath18 ) is based on the x - ray contours shown in figure 2 of @xcite , which suggests that the source is resolved by _ suzaku _ xis into diffuse emission .",

    "no extended sources were found .",
    "we also created a `` fluxed '' image by subtracting the point sources and replacing them with the local background using the dmfilth ciao tool and then dividing by the exposure map but no signs of diffuse emission are seen at various binning and smoothing scales .",
    "we have detected 12 and 7 x - ray point sources in the fields of j1741a and j1741b , respectively , at a significance level @xmath31 ( table  1 ) .",

    "therefore , psr b1737@xmath130 may be contributing to the observed x - ray emission from the binary , if it can not be separated from the cv emission due to the broad psf of _ suzaku _ xrt .",
    "the lack of _ cxo _ data precludes pinpointing the precise position of the cv and confidently distinguishing the cv emission from that of psr b1737@xmath130 or its pwn .",
    "an additional _ cxo _ observation is needed to isolate and study these two sources .",
    "the automated mw classification suggests that source 17 is an agn with fairly low x - ray flux , which makes it an unlikely counterpart to the tev source ( see above ) .",
    "the other two confidently classified sources ( # 14 and 19 ) appear to be stars .",
    "four x - ray sources lack confident classifications . of these ,",
    "sources 13 and 15 are sufficiently bright to perform spectral fits ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "both sources are best - fit by an absorbed bb model and the best - fit parameters are given in table 2 . neither source",
    "is confidently classified by our automated pipeline .",
    "the optical / nir / ir magnitudes for the possible mw counterparts of sources 13 and 15 are listed in table 3 .",
    "the candidate optical / nir / ir counterpart of source 13 exhibits very red colors ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this dereddened r - band magnitude makes the optical to x - ray flux ratio unusually large for a typical agn ( see also figure 4 in @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "prior to any dereddening the optical / nir / ir spectrum resembles that of a very cool star ( l dwarf ) which must then be very nearby ( few tens of parsecs ) .",
    "however , the source does not exhibit any measurable proper motion and the x - ray fit suggests substantial extinction ( which perhaps could be intrinsic for a cool brown dwarf ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the extinction , the unknown distance , and poor quality of the x - ray spectrum also leave a heavily obscured agn as an option .",
    "however , an r - band magnitude of 17.47 , when dereddened by @xmath76 ( corresponding to the total galactic absorption of n@xmath33=1.47@xmath77 @xmath14 ; ) , becomes 10.3 .",
    "this would correspond to an extremely large optical to x - ray flux ratio ( @xmath78 ) which is typical for a cool star and atypical for agn .",
    "therefore , the mw properties of source 13 are puzzling and it is not surprising that the automated classifier is confused .",
    "of course , there always remains a small chance that the optical / nir / ir source is not the true counterpart of the x - ray source 13 .",
    "source 15 has a possible optical and nir counterpart and can be seen in the _ spitzer _ image in figure 1 .",
    "it has a known classification of wolf - rayet star ( known as wr 98a ) @xcite .",
    "wr 98a is at a distance of @xmath79 kpc ( @xcite ) which corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of 3.8 @xmath56 10@xmath80 ergs s@xmath16 .",
    "our classification algorithm was unable to confidently classify this source .",
    "however , wr 98a is surrounded by a dusty pinwheel nebula @xcite .",
    "this is indicative of a tight binary which may contain two high - mass stars with strong colliding winds @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the automated algorithm is confused by this , as it does not have colliding wind wr binaries as a separate class .",
    "interestingly , it was suggested that such binaries could be tev sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) but none have been detected so far .",
    "our mw classification of 19 sources from two _ cxo _ observations did not yield an obvious candidate for the tev emission from j1741a / b .",
    "our automated machine learning classification algorithm relatively confidently classified 8 sources ( 4 agn and 4 stars ) .",
    "however , hess j1741 - 302 is not likely an agn due to the low x - ray to tev flux ratios , while non - degenerate coronally active stars do not emit tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "sources 2 , 10 and 13 could be obscured agn or remote xrbs while source 10 could also be a new middle - aged pulsar .",
    "source 15 in the field of j1741b has a known wr star ( wr 98a ) within the _ cxo _ error ellipse , which is likely a binary , raising the intriguing possibility of the first detection of such a system in tev @xmath0-rays . for the j1741a region we also can not rule out tev emission from the star forming clouds ( see the spitzer image in figure 1 ) that provide a dense environment and enhanced ir photon background .",
    "this would still require a source of relativistic protons or electrons at the same distance .",
    "suzaku j1741 , which appears to be extended in the _ suzaku _ image , and was previously mentioned as a plausible counterpart to j1741a , is resolved by _ cxo _ into a number of faint point sources none of which looks particularly promising as a counterpart for the tev emission .",
    "no diffuse emission is seen in the _ cxo _ image .",
    "the analysis of mw data also did not produce any credible counterparts .",
    "the _ integral _ flux enhancement near the position of suzaku j1740 is consistent with the proposed magnetic cv nature , which implies no tev emission .",
    "however , the pwn of the young radio pulsar b173730 , located outside of the _ cxo _ field of view , also remains a possible counterpart for the tev source .",
    "further observations of this field , including the three pulsars , are needed to look for possible offset pwne from psr j17393023 or psr b173730 .",
    "these observations would also enable us to spatially resolve the x - ray emission from psr b173730 and cataclysmic variable suzaku j1740 .",
    "future tev observations will also help build enough statistics to determine whether there are two separate sources or only one larger extended source and further constrain the tev spectrum .",
    "until the contributions from the relic pwne associated with the two pulsars are ruled out the source can hardly be on the list of  dark accelerators `` , assuming that the ' ' dark accelerator \" term is reserved for tev sources lacking any plausible counterparts in a reasonable vicinity .",
