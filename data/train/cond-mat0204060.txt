    "recent advances in the controlled fabrication and manipulation of ultra - low temperature trapped bose gases @xcite has finally made it possible to experimentally investigate the existence of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) , i.e. , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , in dimensions lower than three .",
    "this remarkable experimental achievment has rekindled an interest in the classic theoretical problem concerning the existence of bec in two - dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "although it is well known that finite - temperature bec can never occur in a homogeneous 2d bose gas @xcite , the ideal trapped bose gas can undergo bec below some critical temperature @xmath3 . in the case of a 2d isotropic harmonic trap with confining frequency @xmath4 ( unless stated otherwise , we always implicitly assume this confinement geometry ) , bagnato and kleppner have shown that @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 ; shevchenko later extened this result to include more general power law potentials @xcite . in the thermodnyamic limit , viz .",
    ", @xmath7 , @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 , bec is also known to theoretically occur with the critical temperature remaining unchanged .",
    "note that this is not the usual thermodynamic limit , which in 2d would demand that @xmath10 , resulting in no bec ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative thermodynamic limit in the case of an interacting bose gas ) .",
    "if repulsive interactions between bosons are included , ( we only consider repulsive interactions in this paper ) , then a definitive answer to the question of bec in the trapped 2d gas is not so clear .",
    "in fact , there is no _ a priori _ reason for the existence of bec in a confined two or three - dimensional system  bec is a purely kinematical phenomenon in the sense that even the ideal bose gas can undergo the phase transition .",
    "in contrast , a transition to the superfluid state is wholey dynamical and _ can not _",
    "occur without interactions .",
    "therefore , one could sensibly assume that interactions prevent the spatial redistribution of atoms required to achieve bose gas degeneracy , and therefore destroy the bec phase transition altogether .",
    "it is only recently that a rigorous proof has been given to show that there is no finite temperature bec in the interacting trapped 2d bose gas in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "of course , in actual experiments , the theormodyamic limit is never fully realized , and it becomes necessary to consider systems consisting of a _ finite _ number of atoms confined in a trap . in this",
    "regard , lieb and seiringer @xcite have proved that the finite , interacting trapped bose gas does have 100% bec at @xmath11 .",
    "to date however , no irrefutable case has been made ( experimentally or theoretically ) in support of finite temperature bec in an interacting finite 2d system . in a recent paper , petrov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested that that there are in fact two bec regimes for finite , trapped , ( quasi)-2d systems .",
    "the general argument supporting their claim hinges on an approximate analytical calculation of the one - particle density martix from which information about the phase correlations of the condensate can be obtained . for large particle number and sufficiently low temperatures , petrov _ et al .",
    "_ deduce that the phase fluctuations are governed by @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , at temperatures well below @xmath13 , fluctuations in the phase are supressed and one has a `` true condensate '' whereas for @xmath14 , the phase fluctuations are enhanced and one has a `` quasi - condensate '' .",
    "similar results have recently been obtained by bogliubov _",
    "et al . , _ in strictly two - dimenions  @xcite",
    ".    however , bhaduri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested that there is no bec phase transition in a finite , interacting 2d bose gas ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for similar conclusions ) . in their investigation ,",
    "a semiclassical approximation to the hartree - fock - bogliubov ( hfb ) mean - field theory was used to investigate the thermodynamics of the trapped 2d bose gas .",
    "although the semiclassical hfb approach could not shed any light on the question of phase fluctuations , it was shown that the hfb equations could be solved self - consistently all the way down to @xmath11 provided one _ does not _ invoke the presence of a condensate .",
    "this finding seems to indicate that that if no _ a priori _ assumption of a condensate is made ( as it should be ) , the system remains in the same _ uncondensed phase _ at all temperatures .",
    "( note that applying the same hfb approach in 3d requires a condensate in order to obtain self - consistent solutions below @xmath0 . ) in spite of the absence of a condensate order - parameter however , the density distribution for the uncondensed phase was found to clearly exhibit a large spatial accumulation of atoms near the center of the trap for @xmath15 , similar to what is found in systems with a condensate .",
    "this suggests that there may be some sort of `` revival '' of odlro in the system , even though it does not lead to the formation of a condensate .",
    "since the off - diagonal one - particle density matrix can provide information about phase correlations and odlro in the system , an investigation of the off - diagonal density martix within the hfb approximation needs to be performed .",
    "this is indeed the central motivation for the present work .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ noninteracting ] we investigte the noninteracting 2d gas in a harmonic trap where an exact expression for the finite temperature correlation function can be obtained . in sec .",
    "[ interacting ] , we calculate the correlation function for the interacting system within the semiclassical hfb approximation and investigate its temperature dependence both above and below @xmath0 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we wish to pay special attention to the off - diagonal , one - particle density matrix @xmath16 of the noninteracting , confined 2d bose gas .",
    "our motivation lies in the fact that odlro in the one - particle density matrix and bec are interrelated @xcite ( see below for details ) . for the isotropic ho ,",
    "@xmath16 can be calculated analytically , and we have an exact result from which we can quantitatively test the validity of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "we will be particularly interested how well the seimclassical approximation describes the phase correlations of the gas below the bec critical temperature @xmath17 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first such study in two - dimensions .    by definition , the off - diagonal one - particle density matrix is given by @xcite ^(0)(,*r* ; ) =",
    "_ j ^(0)_j ( ) ^(0)_j()^ n^(0)_j  , [ green ] where @xmath18 are exact eigenfunctions of the @xmath19-dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) and @xmath20 is the bose distribution function .",
    "it is most convenient to evaluate ( [ green ] ) for the 1d case , and then use the separability of the ho potential to obtain the general result .",
    "explicitly , we have ^(0)(x , x ; ) = _ n=0^e^- ( x^2 + x^2 )  , [ green2 ] where @xmath21 are the energy levels of the ho , @xmath22 is the chemical potential , and we have scaled all energies and lengths by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we now set the zero of energy to correspond to the lowest trap level , viz . , @xmath25 , and obtain from ( [ green2 ] ) ^(0)(x , x ; ) = _ j=1^e^j _ n=0^e^- ( x^2 + x^2)e^-jn  , where we have used @xcite _",
    "j=1^e^je^-jn =  .",
    "the summation over trap levels can be perfomed exactly @xcite , and we finally obtain in any dimension ^(0)(, ; ) = _",
    "j=1^ e^-1/4[|+|^2(j/2)+|-|^2(j/2 ) ]  . putting @xmath26 in the above equation",
    "reproduces the result obtained by barnett _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential is obtained by enforcing that the total particle number @xmath27 , remain fixed , viz .",
    ", n = _ j=1^  .",
    "the diagonal part of the one - particle density matrix yields the exact quantum - mechanical finite temperature density , @xmath28 , of the trapped gas .",
    "the densities for various temperatures are shown in fig .  1 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 atoms .",
    "figure 1 illustrates that even though we are not in the thermodynamic limit , the single - particle density distribution exhibits an enormous accumulation of atoms near the center of the trap for @xmath31 .",
    "this type of behaviour is consistent with the confined gas having undergone a phase transition to the bec state .",
    "the usual approach for confirming that this phase transition is indeed bec is to examine the temperature dependence of the fractional occupancy of the lowest oscillator level , @xmath32 .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "1 shows that below @xmath33 , the ground state of the system becomes macroscopically occupied , with already @xmath34 of the atoms in the lowest level at @xmath35 .",
    "remarkably , even at @xmath30 atoms , the fractional occupancy closely follows the quadratic temperature dependence obtained strictly in the thermodynamic limit ( dashed line in figure inset ) , viz .",
    ", = 1 - ( ) ^2  .",
    "although @xmath32 gives us a strong indication that the finite system has a bec transition at @xmath33 , it does not provide us with a definitive test for the presence of odlro in the system .",
    "it is well known since the early work of penrose and onsager @xcite that for a _ homogeneous _ system , the phenomenon of bec is intimately related to the presence of odlro in the off - diagonal one - particle density matrix , namely , _",
    "|-|^(0)(, ; ) 0  .",
    "in fact , the low temperature behaviour of @xmath36 is directly related to the phase fluctuations of the condensate @xcite and the non - zero limiting value of eq .",
    "( 8) yields the value of the order parameter ( i.e. , condensate fraction ) in the system . for finite inhomogeneous systems however , the above criterion has to be modified to account for the fact that odlro can not extend beyond the physical size of the system .",
    "this is accomplished by defining a normalized correlation function ( sometimes called the first - order coherence function ) by g^(0)(, ; ) =  , such that _ |-|g^(0)(,;)0  .",
    "the above correlation function describes a local measure of coherence in the system .",
    "for example , the ability of two bec s , intially separated by @xmath37 , to form an interference pattern is quantified by @xmath38 @xcite . in this sense , the correlation function also characterizes local fluctuations of the phase of the condensate order - parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is the large - distance length - scale over which the odlro of the finite system is manifested . at zero temperature , @xmath40 , whereas for @xmath41 , @xmath39 is taken to be the spatial extent of the single - particle density @xmath28 . to simplify our calculations , we fix one of the coordinate , @xmath42 to be at the center of the trap .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , dividing the off - diagonal density matrix by the square root of the single - particle densities removes any effects of the local - density of particles on the correlation function , and gives @xmath43 in the case of perfect coherence .    the solid curves in fig .",
    "2 depict the correlation function @xmath44 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 at various temperatures . from left to right , we have @xmath45 . above the critical temperature ,",
    "the atoms remain in the uncondensed phase and the system shows no odlro .",
    "however , as the gas is cooled below the transition temperature , we see an abrupt jump in the large - distance decay of the spatial correlations . a direct application of eq .  ( 10 ) yields condensate fractions of @xmath46 , for temperatures @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "thus , below @xmath17 , the finite noninteracting 2d bose gas contains a non - zero order - parameter ( i.e. , a bec ) .",
    "it also proves very useful to compare the spatial extent of the single - particle density , @xmath28 , to the spatial decay of the correlation function @xmath44 .",
    "this information is also presented in fig .  2 where the exact quantum mechanical densities are represented by dashed lines .",
    "these densities have been scaled by their value at @xmath48 to allow for a comparison of the length scales between @xmath28 and @xmath44 . from right to left , the dashed lines correspond to densities at @xmath49 .",
    "densities at lower temperatures are almost indistinguishable on the scale of the figure .",
    "we note that at low temperatures , the correlation function is practically a constant @xmath50 over the entire region for which the density ( i.e. , physical size of the system ) of the gas is nonzero .",
    "this means that phase fluctuations are very small , and the density distribution corresponds to that of a `` true condensate '' . at higher temperatures",
    "( i.e. , @xmath51 ) the single - paricle density can become comparable to that of @xmath44 , and the gas can be said to be a `` quasi - condensate '' in the sense that the phase correlations do not extend to all of the atoms in the trap . for @xmath52 , the spatial extent of the single - particle density greatly exceeds",
    "characteristic length of the correlations , and system is in the normal state .    having obtained the exact expression for @xmath53 , we now wish to examine its semiclassical approximation , namely , its behaviour when @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to show that eq  ( 5 ) reduces to @xmath55/2\\right]^j\\exp\\left[-|\\bfr-\\bfr'|^2)/2\\beta\\right]^{1/j}\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\beta)^{d/2}}g_{d/2}(\\exp\\left [ \\beta(\\mu- [ v(\\bfr)+v(\\bfr')]/2)\\right],\\exp\\left[-|\\bfr-\\bfr'|^2)/2\\beta\\right])~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have introduced the generalized bose function g_(x , y ) = _",
    "j=1^  . for @xmath57 and @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( 12 ) becomes ^(0 ) ( ) =  , with the normalization condition n =  ^(0 ) ( )  d^2  .",
    "if one attempts to solve eqs .",
    "( 14,15 ) for all @xmath58 , it is readily shown that there exists a temperature @xmath59 below which the equations can no longer be satisfied  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the temperature @xmath59 is identical to the the critical temperature @xmath3 obtained by bagnato and kleppner  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to obtain solutions below @xmath3 , a condensate order parameter is required .",
    "we introduce the macroscopic occupation of the ground state in the one - particle density matrix according to the _ ansatz _ ^(0)(, ) = n_0 ^(0)_0 ( ) ^(0)_0( ) + g_d/2 ( , )  , where @xmath60 is the zero temperature ground - state eigenfunction of the ho and n_0 =  .",
    "the 2d density is then given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) with @xmath57 , ^(0 ) ( ) = n_0|^(0)_0()|^2 +  .",
    "the semiclassical densities obtained from eq .  ( 18 ) are indistinguishable from the exact densities obtained from eq .",
    "the semiclassical correlation function , eq .",
    "( 16 ) , at various temperatures is represented in fig .  2 as filled circles .",
    "the superb agreement between the exact ( solid curves ) and semiclassical results shows that the semiclassical approximation is valid well below the critical temperature provided one takes into account the macroscopic occupation of the ground state separately . if the atoms had remained in the uncondensed phase , eqs .",
    "( 14,15 ) would have been sufficient to describe the gas for all @xmath61 .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the interacting bose gas are most commonly described by the self - consistent mean - field hfb equations . in most calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for details ) , the semiclassical approximation is applied to the discrete set of coupled bogliubov equations , leading to the considerably simplified semiclassical hfb theory .",
    "the semiclassical hfb approximation is well - known to be an excellent tool for describing the interacting 3d bose gas @xcite .",
    "the 2d version of the semiclassical hfb theory is formally identical to the 3d version and has already been examined by mullin @xcite .",
    "we present only the essentials of the model here for completeness .    in the semiclassical hfb approach ,",
    "the condensed and uncondensed atoms are described by a set of coupled , self - consistent equations .",
    "the macroscopic condensate wavefunction , @xmath62 , is characterized by the finite - temperature gross - pitaevskii equation which is given by _ 0 ( ) = 0  , where @xmath63 is the coupling constant associated with the assumed repulsive zero - range two - body pseudo - potential .",
    "the total density , @xmath64 , is made up of a condensate @xmath65 , and a noncondensate density , _ t ( ) =  \\ { f ( , ) + v^2 ( , ) }  d^2  , where f ( , ) =  , u^2 ( , ) =  , v^2 ( , ) =  , = + r^2 - + 2 ( )  , and ( , ) =  .",
    "the total number of particles satisfies n =  [ _ 0 ( ) + _ t ( ) ]  d^2 . in the absence of a condensate ,",
    "it is easy to show that the above set of hfb equations reduce to _ t ( ) =  , with n =  _ t ( )  d^2 .    equations ( 27,28 ) are equivalent to the so - called self - consistent thomas - fermi approximation used in refs .  @xcite .",
    "putting @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( 27 ) yields an expression that is identical to the semiclassical approximation of the exact diagonal density matrix , viz . , eq .",

    "3 the density and chemical potential ( figure inset ) of the gas for @xmath69 ( long - dash - short - dashed line ) , @xmath70 ( solid line ) , and @xmath71 ( dashed line ) .",
    "in contrast to the noninteracting 2d gas ( where a condensate order - parameter has to be introduced below @xmath17 ) , the interacting system remains in the uncondensed phase for all @xmath61 .",
    "although no condensation occurs , it is interesting to compare the densities of the noninteracting ( fig .  1 ) and interacting gases ( fig .",
    "3 ) just above and below @xmath17 . the essential point to be made from this comparison is that in both cases , there is an increase in the density of atoms near the center of the trap for @xmath72 .",
    "while the noninteracting density shows a much larger enhancement at @xmath48 , the interacting gas also displays a similar ( albeit diminished ) behaviour . since an increase in the density of atoms near the center of the trap",
    "is associated with odlro in the noninteracting gas , it is worthwhile investigating the off - diagonal density matrix for the interacting 2d gas within the semiclassical hfb approximation .",
    "the 2d semiclassical hfb off - diagonal density matrix can be obtained from the leading order term in the wigner - kirkwood semiclassical expansion of the quantum mechanical off - diagnonal density matrix @xcite .",
    "the noncondensed particles are treated as bosons in an effective potential , and we obtain ( ,  ; ) = g_1 ( , )  , where v_eff ( ) = r^2 + 2 ( )  . since there is no condensate for @xmath73 , we _ have not _ included the first term in eq .",
    "of course , for @xmath74 , eq .  ( 29 ) reduces to eq .",
    "( 27 ) .    as in sec .",
    "[ noninteracting ] , the normalized correlation function for the finite sized system is given by g(,0 ; ) =  , where again , we have fixed @xmath75 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath76 is shown in figs .  4 , 5 for coupling strengths @xmath77 , respectivley .    above @xmath17 , the interacting and noninteracting ( see fig .",
    "2 ) systems have similar correlations .",
    "however , as we cool the gas to temperatures just below @xmath17 , there is an drastic change in the behaviour of the interacting off - diagonal density matrix , which to the best of our knowledge , has never been noticed before . in particluar",
    ", we observe that the decay of the correlations in the interacting system are qualitatively different from the noninteracting gas .",
    "for the interacting gas , values of @xmath78 lead to the tail of the correlation function decreasing slowler than the noninteracting case .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath79 , the interacting correlation function has a much faster spatial decay than the noninteracting system .",
    "we have already discussed the fact that the near constancy of the noninteracting correlation function , @xmath38 , over the size of the sample ( @xmath80 ) is indicative of negligible phase fluctuations in the condensate @xcite .",
    "thus , the re - appearance of odlro in @xmath81 below @xmath17 suggests that there may be larger fluctuations in the phase as compared to the noninteracting gas .",
    "if we apply eq .",
    "( 10 ) to @xmath81 ( with @xmath70 ) , we obtain @xmath82 at @xmath83 respectively , for the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation fucntion . even though we may not be able to interpret these numbers as condensate fractions , it is tempting to conjecture that they represent a nonzero value of an order - parameter in the system",
    ".    we can be more quantitative about the nature of the correlations displayed by @xmath81 below @xmath17 as follows . in the interacting _ homogeneous _",

    "algebraic _ odlro exhibited by @xmath81 implies that at low temperature , correlations can extend over macroscopic ( i.e. , size of the system ) distances , although phase fluctutations will be nonzero .",
    "this is reminiscent of the quasi - condensate described in ref .",
