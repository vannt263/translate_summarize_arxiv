    "according to modern theories of large scale structure formation , clusters of galaxies are built up hierarchically through successive mergers and accretion of smaller subsystems @xcite .",
    "in particular , major mergers involving multiple subclusters of comparable masses ( hereafter simply `` mergers '' unless otherwise indicated ) are dramatic events that strongly affect the intracluster medium ( icm ) and can convert as much as @xmath9 erg of kinetic energy into thermal energy through shocks and turbulence @xcite .",
    "shocks not only heat the gas but can also produce high - energy , nonthermal particles through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite and provide a key observational tool in the study of cluster growth .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed direct evidence of shock fronts through discontinuities in the surface brightness and temperature in the icm of merging clusters , for example the so - called `` bullet '' cluster 1e 0657 - 56 @xcite , and more recently in abell  2146 @xcite and abell  754 @xcite .",
    "such shocks discovered so far in x - rays are associated with clusters undergoing relatively major mergers @xcite .",
    "large - scale shocks driven by the accretion of diffuse gas that is not bound in virialized systems are also theoretically expected and generally seen in numerical simulations @xcite , but have yet to be observationally confirmed in x - rays .",
    "the coma cluster is one of the best - studied clusters of galaxies because of its low redshift ( @xmath10 ) and its high richness @xcite . in view of its inhomogeneous distribution of galaxies and disturbed x - ray surface brightness",
    ", it is acknowledged to be a merging system @xcite .",
    "the rosat x - ray image clearly shows some substructures @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented temperature maps based on asca data that revealed the icm distribution to be non - isothermal .",
    "@xcite reported the structure of coma on large scales based on xmm - newton mosaic observations , which indicate that it is now undergoing at least one subcluster - cluster merger .",
    "in particular , the group of galaxies associated with the elliptical galaxy ngc  4839 is a prominent substructure located southwest of the cluster center , and may be falling into coma @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found indications of a bow shock and ram pressure stripping around ngc  4839 .",
    "merging clusters including coma also often exhibit radio halos and/or radio relics , which are spatially - extended , synchrotron emission from non - thermal populations of electrons that are somehow accelerated over scales of up to @xmath11mpc @xcite .",
    "radio halos occur in the central regions with a fairly symmetric morphology , and are often considered to be a result of stochastic acceleration by merger - induced turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ; see however @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , radio relics are found near the cluster periphery with a tangentially - elongated morphology , and may be due to dsa in accretion or merger shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coma radio relic is located near its virial radius about 2 mpc in projection from the cluster center , beyond ngc4839 but in the same southwest direction .",
    "@xcite investigated the relic region with xmm - newton observations .",
    "although they detected thermal emission around the radio relic , they did not find any temperature enhancement or evidence of a shock in regions northeast of the relic towards the cluster center .",
    "thus they proposed that the relativistic electrons are accelerated by turbulence generated by the infall of the ngc  4839 group , rather than by shock acceleration .",
    "@xcite discussed the possible connection with ongoing accretion based on their radio and optical observations .",
    "recently , @xmath12 found signatures of shock fronts through measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in two regions about half a degree to the west and to the south - east of the cluster center , which correspond to the edge of the radio halo  @xcite .",
    "they derive mach numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the shocks in the west and southeast , respectively .",
    "gamma - ray observations searching for evidence of high - energy particles have also been conducted for coma , but have not been successful so far ( @xcite ; see however @xcite ) .",
    "possible associations between shocks and radio relics have also been found in a number of other merging clusters .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of a double radio relic with an unprecedentedly narrow morphology in a merging cluster .",
    "the spatially resolved radio spectral index is @xmath15 along the sharp outer edges of the relics , which presumably reflects the spectrum of the emitting electrons that have just been accelerated and are yet to be affected by radiative losses . under the assumption that these electrons are generated according to the simplest , test - particle theory of dsa",
    ", the spectral index can be related to the mach number of the shock , which in this case would be @xmath16 .",
    "subsequent , deep x - ray follow - up observations revealed the existence of a shock front at the radio relic  @xcite .",
    "the cluster abell  3667 has a pair of radio relics , of which the northwestern one is the brightest diffuse cluster radio source in the sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence of a merger - induced shock at the outer edge of this relic , and showed that it was energetically capable of powering the radio relic .",
    "thus , it appears that radio relics can be good tracers of merger shocks in clusters .    in this paper , we discuss x - ray observations focusing on the regions of interaction between coma and ngc  4839 and the radio relic located near the outskirts of the coma cluster .",
    "we assume cosmological parameters @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which implies 28.9 kpc per arcminute at coma s redshift of @xmath21 .",

    "fig : radial ] ) . since ngc4839 is most probably moving relative to the icm from the sw toward the ne , facing an increasing density of gas in front of it , it is possible that the gas to the sw has been stripped from this galaxy or its associated group .",
    "our data may provide direct observational evidence that the icm is enriched by infalling galaxies and groups at large distances from the cluster center ( 0.5 - 0.8 @xmath30 ) .    aside from the high abundance region associated with ngc4839 , our data gives the abundance up to 0.9 @xmath30 .",
    "the observed abundance at large radii decreases to @xmath170 solar .",
    "this is similar to previously obtained abundance values at large radii in other clusters as mentioned above ( perseus and a399 & a401 ) .",
    "recently , a low abundance value was found at large radii in the virgo cluster  @xcite .",
    "they interpreted the low abundance as arising from biasing by the fe l lines used to determine the abundance .",

    "we confirm the existence of metals in the cluster periphery in coma along the direction of the merger with the ngc4839 group .",
    "what does this tell us about the origin of these heavy elements ?",

    "although subject to many assumptions , this shows that ram - pressure stripping may be marginally possible down to this radius . after the metals are stripped from the ngc4839 group , they could diffuse due to the turbulence associated with the merger .    due to projection ,",
    "the ngc 4839 group might be at a larger radius where the density is lower .",
    "the outer regions of clusters might also be polluted with metals due to galactic superwinds , which may have operated at @xmath194 ( @xcite ) before cluster formation .",
    "some numerical simulations @xcite suggest that galactic superwind feedback at high redshifts driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts could provide metals to the proto - cluster gas .",
    ".shock properties [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : mach ]    the coma radio relic , first discovered by @xcite , is one of the best - known relics .",
    "its location corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath112.1 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "the relic measures roughly @xmath195 kpc in the tangential and radial directions , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported a spatially integrated spectral index of @xmath196 between 151 mhz and 4.75 ghz , consistent with previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "our suzaku data shows a relatively steep temperature drop from inside the relic to outside it towards the southwest .",
    "this suggests that a shock is located somewhere between the middle of the relic and the region just to the southwest ; unfortunately , the limited spatial resolution of suzaku does not provide stronger constraints on the location of the shock front .",
    "shock fronts at the outer edges of radio relics have now been seen in a number of other merging clusters ( e.g. , a3667 ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the temperature is high everywhere to the ne of the relic , this indicates that the shock is propagating towards the sw relative to the pre - shock gas .",
    "some of the estimated properties of the shock are listed in table  [ tab : mach ] .",
    "we estimate the mach number @xmath197 from the rankine - hugoniot condition for the temperature jump , @xmath198 where subscripts 1 and 2 denote pre - shock and post - shock values , respectively , and the assumed ratio of specific heats is @xmath199 .",
    "we estimate the post- and pre - shock temperatures based on the temperatures in the annuli from - and - , respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath200 , which is similar to the values estimated for other shocks associated with radio relics ( e.g. , a3667:@xcite ) . with these values ,",
    "the shock speed is @xmath201 km s@xmath18 .    with this value for the mach number",
    ", the shock compression is predicted to be @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the gas density .",
    "one can also estimate the shock compression from the jump in the x - ray surface brightness across the relic .",
    "the surface brightness was derived from the observed spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : sb ] shows the x - ray surface brightness ( 0.510 kev ) for the same regions used to derived the spectra . there is a drop in the surface brightness by a factor of @xmath115.2 near the outer edge of the relic .",
    "projection effects and the low spatial resolution of suzaku are likely to cause this to be a slight underestimate of the surface brightness jump . for a fixed line of sight path through the gas ,",
    "this jump in surface brightness corresponds to a shock compression of @xmath204 , including the difference in emissivity for the two regions .",
    "given that this is probably a slight underestimate , the surface brightness jump is completely consistent with the shock compression of @xmath205 predicted based on the temperature jump .",
    "radio relics generally have rather steep radio spectra , which are believed to be result of radiative losses by the relativistic electrons which produce the synchrotron emission . in a number of cases ,",
    "the radio spectrum is relatively flat at the outer edge of the relic at the location of the shock , and steepens along the direction of flow away from the shock ( e.g. , a3667 : @xcite , @xcite ; ciza2242 : @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the relic and the distance over which the spectrum steepens are consistent with the predicted radiative loss rate and the flow velocity in abell 3667 .",
    "assuming the strength of the magnetic field is 1 - 5  @xmath206 g , the radiative loss time of electrons which radiate at 150 mhz would be @xmath207 gyr ( see fig .",
    "1.6 in @xcite ) ; it is shorter for higher frequency radio emission .",
    "the velocity of the post - shock gas relative to the shock is given by @xmath208 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the width of the relic is about 200 - 400 kpc , and it takes about @xmath209 gyr for icm to travel this distance away from the shock .",
    "thus , the radiative loss time is likely to be shorter than the advection time for the electrons which emit at all radio frequencies of at least 150 mhz .",
    "if the relativistic electrons are accelerated from thermal energies by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) and there is no dynamical effect of the relativistic particles or magnetic field on the shock , then the energy spectrum of the relativistic electrons depends only on the shock compression , and is given by @xmath210 , where the power - law index is @xmath211 . for our shock compression",
    ", this implies @xmath212 .",
    "if the magnetic field in the relic is roughly constant , such a power - law energy spectrum will lead to synchrotron emission with a spectrum @xmath213 , where @xmath214 .",
    "this should apply to the radio spectrum immediately behind the shock .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we are aware , the most recent radio spectral index maps for the coma radio relic were given by @xcite , and they do not show any clear systematic spectral variations across the relic .",
    "thus , it is most useful to compare to the integrated spectral index for the relic .",
    "as noted above , we expect radiative losses to be quite effective in the coma relic .",
    "if the particles lose energy quickly and there is a steady - state between acceleration and radiative losses , then the particle spectrum steepens by unity , @xmath215 , and the integrated radio spectrum is steeper by one half , @xmath216 .",
    "this is steeper than the observed integrated radio spectrum , @xmath196 , although the errors in the predicted spectral index are large . for test - particle dsa",
    ", the observed radio spectrum would require a shock compression of @xmath217 , which is considerably higher than what is suggested by the temperature or surface brightness jump in the shock .",
    "obviously , it would be useful to have a better spectral index map for the coma relic , which might allow us to directly determine the spectrum of the most recently accelerated electrons .",
    "the magnetic field strengths assumed above can be justified from upper limits to the non - thermal , inverse compton ( ic ) x - ray emission emanating from the same population of electrons that generate the radio relic .",
    "relativistic electrons that scatter photons of the cosmic microwave background up to energies 1 - 10 kev would have lorentz factors @xmath218 and radiative loss times @xmath219 gyr , longer than the aforementioned advection time .",
    "hence the electron spectrum at these energies should remain the same as that at acceleration , and the expected photon index of the ic x - ray emission is @xmath220 .",
    "thus we analyze the xis spectrum of regions around the radio relic by including a power - law component with @xmath220 in addition to the thermal icm emission ; @xmath221 . in this paper",
    ", we account for systematic errors due to contamination on the detector filter as well as cxb+nxb fluctuations . for the spectrum of the 34-38 annular region along the outer edge of the relic ( fig .",
    "3(k ) ) , the upper limits on the flux of such a nonthermal component is @xmath222 ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) . considering the entire radio - emitting region with area",
    "@xmath223 , we obtain @xmath224 ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) . while the observed radio flux constrains the combination of the magnetic field strength and the density of non - thermal electrons , upper limits to the ic flux gives an upper limit to the latter alone , allowing us to derive a lower bound on the field strength of @xmath225 g .",
    "this can be compared with the result of @xmath226 g based on xmm - newton data @xcite .",
    "it is also in line with values of @xmath227 g obtained from faraday rotation measurements for regions at 2 mpc distance from the cluster center  @xcite .",
    "we note that our flux limits are also useful for constraining other potential non - thermal emission components ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although our observations confirm the presence of a shock associated with the coma radio relic , and the width of the relic is consistent with the flow velocity and radiative loss time scale behind the shock , and the radio polarization implies that the magnetic field is roughly parallel to the long axis of the relic @xcite as expected for a shock , the observed radio spectrum appears to be flatter than what would be the case for the simplest test - particle dsa theory .",
    "although the errors in the shock properties we derived are large , we note that similar results have been found for several other relics , including the nw relic in abell  3667 @xcite , and ciza  2242 @xcite .",
    "however , compared to the simplest , test - particle theory , the physics of dsa under conditions that are realistic and appropriate for clusters can be more complicated , with no trivial correspondence between the shock mach number and the spectral index of accelerated particles",
    ". there are at least two possible ways in which the actual spectrum of accelerated particles can be harder than the naive expectation from test particle theory , as is observed to be the case here for the coma radio relic .    the first possibility concerns nonlinear dsa in cosmic ray modified shocks ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if the efficiency of injection into the dsa process is sufficiently high , the pressure due to the accelerated particles can exert a nonlinear , dynamical back reaction onto the structure of the shock . the particle spectrum in such circumstances",
    "is no longer a simple power - law , but attains an overall , concave shape .",
    "the spectrum at lower energies becomes softer than the test - particle case as the velocity jump perceived by these particles is reduced by the back reaction , while the spectrum at higher energies becomes harder because of the increased compressibility of the downstream gas and consequently enhanced velocity jump .",
    "nevertheless , this is unlikely to provide an explanation for the observed facts here , since 1 ) shocks with mach numbers as low as @xmath228 are not expected to foster dsa with efficiencies high enough for nonlinear effects to become important , 2 ) for the conditions relevant to shocks in clusters , the harder spectrum is expected to occur at energies much higher than for the electrons responsible for the radio relics ( e.g. @xcite ) , that is , the radio spectrum may actually be softer than the test particle case if nonlinear effects were effective , and 3 ) the surface brightness profile shows no evidence of extra compression that might characterize nonlinear shocks , and instead the measured compression agrees reasonably with ( albeit being slightly smaller than ) that expected from the temperature jump for a pure gas shock .",
    "the second and more plausible possibility is dsa initiated by injection of pre - existing nonthermal particles , rather than by that of thermal particles in the icm @xcite . before being processed by the low mach - number shock discussed above",
    ", the pre - shock gas may already contain various types of nonthermal particles , such as those accelerated by accretion shocks with higher mach numbers that presumably occur at larger radii @xcite , those accelerated by turbulence in regions away from shocks @xcite , those generated continuously as secondary electrons and positrons from collisions of accelerated protons with thermal protons of the icm @xcite , or those from past activity of radio or starburst galaxies . for dsa by low mach number shocks , the injection of such pre - existing nonthermal particles can be much more important than that of particles from the thermal distribution for which the efficiency is expected to be quite low . in such cases ,",
    "the spectrum of accelerated particles may be determined by that of the pre - existing population rather than the shock mach number @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have specifically shown that such a model can reproduce the observed properties of some known radio relics associated with shocks detected in x - rays .",
    "although a quantitative discussion is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that unlike in the central regions of the cluster , the icm density in the cluster outskirts is low enough so that nonthermal electrons can survive without significant energy losses over very long times ( longer than a hubble time for some energies , see fig.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the low density also means that injection of secondaries from proton - proton collisions is inefficient , so the most likely source of the pre - existing electrons is direct acceleration by shocks of higher mach number in the past . for the coma radio relic",
    ", they may have originated from past activity of nearby galactic winds or radio galaxies , perhaps from within the ngc 4839 group before its passage through the virial radius , the putative accretion shock at larger radii , or even past superwind activity , after which they were advected inward along the large - scale structure filament from the sw .      in modern theories of hierarchical structure formation , both internal merger shocks and external accretion shocks around clusters of galaxies are predicted @xcite .",
    "external accretion shocks are located at large radii ( about 3 times the virial radius ) , are more spherical in shape , and are expected to have high mach numbers of up to @xmath229 .",
    "internal merger shocks located around the virial radius have mach numbers ranging between 2 - 10 in the simulations , and are smaller in extent .",
    "the temperature jump associated with the coma radio relic located at 2 mpc ( 0.9 @xmath30 ) implies a mach number of @xmath230 , which is not compatible with expectations for an external accretion shock in the diffuse intergalactic medium .",
    "this might be an outgoing merger shock associated with the infall of the ngc4839 group .",
    "the tail and abundance structure around ngc4839 , as well as optical observations , suggest that it is moving to the ne , so the relic shock is obviously not a merger bow shock in front of this group .",
    "another possibility is that the relic shock is due to accretion  of diffuse gas from the large scale structure filament @xcite which extends from coma sw towards the abell 1367 cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed the effect of large - scale accretion flows on the outgoing merger shocks based on their radio observations of the typical major merger cluster abell 3376 .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite indicate that shock fronts are enhanced along filament directions .",
    "in addition , the radio morphology of the radio galaxy ngc4789 suggests that it is affected by an accretion flow onto the coma cluster from the large scale structure filament ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "considering the lower icm temperature in the pre - shock region and the evidence for infall of ngc4839 , the shock may be generated by the combination of the merger between coma and ngc4839 and the inflow of cooler gas from the large scale structure filament towards abell  1367 .",
    "our data may provide direct observational evidence of a shock involved with the infall of the ngc4839 group .",
    "such shocks transform the kinetic energy of the merging subcluster into the thermal energy of the icm , and this process is fundamental for the thermal history of clusters of galaxies . as shown in our previous work @xcite , radio relics are good tracers of large scale structure shock fronts . further studies ( radio , sz , x - rays , and simulations ) are needed in order to further clarify the nature of these shock fronts .",
    "we observed the ngc4839 group and the coma radio relic with the suzaku xis and derived radial profiles of the temperature and the metal abundance .",
    "the temperature across the radio relic shows a jump , which indicates the presence of a shock front .",
    "we estimated a mach number of @xmath231 using the rankine - hugoniot temperature jump condition .      *",
    "the icm temperature distribution is flat between @xmath232 from ngc4839 , and then decreases sharply ( consistent with a @xmath233 shock ) at some location near the outer edge of the radio relic . * compared to the inner regions , there is a clear change in the temperature structure around ngc4839 . *",
    "the icm abundance has a peak at ngc4839 and gradually decreases from 0.6 to 0.2 solar towards the outer regions .",
    "the abundance profile shows an excess over the mean values for other clusters at such large radii as observed with xmm - newton . *",
    "the estimated mach number of the shock is @xmath197=2.2@xmath234 based on the temperature jump , which corresponds to a shock velocity of @xmath201 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness also shows a drop near the outer edge of the radio relic . applying the shock density jump condition to the surface brightness profile gives a mach number which is consistent with the value from the temperature jump .",
    "the implied post - shock velocity and the rate of radiative losses by the radio - emitting relativistic electrons imply that losses are very significant , and can help to explain the relatively narrow width of the relic . * the magnetic field strength of the radio relic region",
    "is constrained to be @xmath2 g from upper limits to the inverse compton x - ray emission , a bound that is somewhat weaker than but consistent with previous similar measurements . *",
    "the observed integrated radio spectrum of the relic is somewhat flatter than what would be predicted by test - particle diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in a shock with the observed mach number and compression .",
    "a similar result is seen in other relics .",
    "we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy , and conclude that the shock may be re - accelerating an existing population of low energy relativistic electrons , rather than directly accelerating thermal electrons to high energies .",
    "this might also explain why some shocks are seen in clusters without associated radio relics .",
    "these results show that the ngc 4839 group is falling into the coma cluster , and that the radio relic was possibly generated by shock acceleration .",
    "the origin of the shock structure is still unclear .",
    "upcoming radio ( lofar : @xcite ) and sz ( alma : @xcite ) observations will provide new insights into the nature of the shock front and the dynamical history of the coma cluster .",
    "obviously , additional wide field x - ray observations would also be very useful .",
    "as this work was being completed , we became aware of the preprint by @xcite , who report evidence for a shock with mach number @xmath235 at the coma radio relic based on archival xmm - newton data .",
