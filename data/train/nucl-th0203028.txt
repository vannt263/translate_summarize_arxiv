    "one of the important signatures of quark - gluon structure in nucleon - nucleon interaction at short distances is the observed strong energy dependence ( @xmath5 ) of the wide angle pp elastic differential cross section at @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the square of the pp c.m . energy . despite the ongoing debate on the validity of perturbative qcd in this energy region @xcite or the debate on the relevance of a particular mechanism of subnucleon interaction ( i.e. quark - interchange@xcite , three - gluon exchange@xcite , reggeon - type contribution@xcite )",
    ", it is commonly accepted that the power - law @xmath7- dependence of the elastic cross section signals the onset of the hard dynamics of the quark - gluon interaction .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of what happens when wide angle pp scattering takes place inside the nucleus , i.e. the incident proton is scattered off a bound proton . if this reaction would have the same @xmath5 energy dependence as that of the cross section of free @xmath8 scattering , one may expect that the incoming proton will favor to scatter off a bound proton with larger initial momentum aligned to the direction of the incoming proton @xcite .",
    "this kinematic condition corresponds to @xmath8 scattering with smaller @xmath7 and therefore larger scattering cross section .",
    "thus , if nuclear effects will not alter the genuine @xmath7-dependence of the @xmath8 cross section , the high momentum transfer @xmath9 reaction would select preferably the high momentum components of the nuclear wave function .    due to the short - range nature of the strong interaction , the high internal momentum in the nucleus",
    "will be generated mainly by short - range nn correlations .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high energies and high momentum transfers one expects to probe the short - range properties of the nucleus . in ref.@xcite within a plane wave impulse approximation  ( pwia ) the authors calculated the cross section of high momentum transfer @xmath1 reactions and observed a strong sensitivity to the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function .",
    "motivated by the recent measurements of high - momentum transfer pa reactions at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl)@xcite we carried out a detailed analysis of the high - momentum transfer @xmath1 reaction investigating specifically the competing nuclear effects , not discussed previously .",
    "these effects may obscure the observed sensitivity shown within pwia  @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to see whether these reactions probe short range correlations ( src ) and their sensitivity to the dynamical structure of these correlations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we outline the basic theoretical framework for the calculation of the high - energy wide angle quasielastic @xmath1 reaction .",
    "we also discuss the nuclear effects which can compete with the expected signatures of the scattering from src . in chapter 3",
    "we present the predictions of the model presented in the chapter 2 .",
    "chapter 4 describes briefly the eva experiment at bnl .",
    "the calculations are compared with the data obtained in this experiment in chapter 5 . in chapter 6",
    "we summarize the results of our study .",
    "in quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering a projectile is elastically scattered from a single bound `` target '' nucleon in the nucleus while the rest of the nucleus acts as a spectator . a schematic presentation of ( p,2p ) qe scattering is given in fig 1 .    [ fig.1 ]",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 - are the four - momenta of the target nucleus , the incoming proton , the scattered proton , the ejected proton and the recoil nucleus , respectively . for simplicity we did not show in the figure  1 @xmath15 and @xmath16 . using the variables defined in the figure",
    "the mandelstam variables are :    @xmath17    the high - momentum transfer primary process in the @xmath1 quasi - elastic reaction is the hard @xmath8 elastic scattering .",
    "since the general predictions are based on the implication of the strong @xmath7-dependence ( @xmath18 ) of hard elastic @xmath8 cross section we will limit our calculations to high energy and high momentum transfer kinematics were the @xmath19-dependence is observed experimentally for @xmath8 scattering off hydrogen target .",
    "thus , our calculations are limited to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the missing energy ( @xmath22 ) for the @xmath1 reaction is given by @xmath22 = @xmath23 + @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath25 @xmath27 @xmath25 @xmath28 .",
    "the available high energy @xmath1 data have a missing energy resolution of about 240 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculations which we compare with the data are integrated over a wide range of missing energy .",
    "this integration simplifies the calculations as will be discussed below .",
    "a clear interpretation of the quasi - elastic measurements is possible in plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . within this approximation",
    "it is possible to separate nuclear properties from the reaction mechanism .    in",
    "a high energy scattering the reaction evolves near the light cone @xmath29 , where z is the direction of the incident proton and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the energy and leading longitudinal momentum of the high energy particles involved in the scattering .",
    "thus it is natural to describe the reaction in the light cone reference frame ( similar to high energy deep - inelastic scattering from hydrogen target see e.g. @xcite ) .    within the light cone plane wave impulse approximation the cross section of the quasielastic @xmath1 reaction can be represented as a convolution of the elementary elastic @xmath8 scattering cross section off bound nucleon and the four - dimensional light cone spectral function@xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33    the superscript @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the transverse ( @xmath36 ) and longitudinal directions with respect to incoming proton momentum @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 indices denote the energy and longitudinal components of four - momenta in the light cone reference frame .",
    "directions is chosen as the direction of incoming proton momentum , the `` - '' component corresponds to the light cone longitudinal momentum , which is conserved at the scattering vertices . ]",
    "the variable @xmath4 defined in eq.([kinvar ] ) describes the light cone momentum fraction of nucleus carried out by target nucleon , normalized in such a way that a nucleon at rest has @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 - is the invariant flux with respect to the nucleus , the @xmath42 and @xmath43 - are the invariant amplitude and cross section for elastic @xmath8 scattering .    the light cone spectral function represents the probability to find the target nucleon with the light cone momenta ( @xmath4 , @xmath44 ) times the probability that the residual nuclear system has a momentum component @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral function is normalized as follows@xcite : @xmath46      the integration over a wide range of the missing energy allows us to use the following approximations for the spectral function :    for target proton momenta below the fermi sea level ( @xmath47 ) we use the nonrelativistic limit of the light cone spectral function@xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the missing momentum components of the reaction .",
    "@xmath51 is the momentum distribution of nucleons calculated within the mean field approximation .    for the momentum range of ( @xmath52",
    "we assume the dominance of the two nucleon short - range correlations which allows to model the spectral function as follows@xcite : @xmath53 where ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 are the light cone momentum and the density matrix of the recoiling @xmath56 system .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is the probability of finding two - nucleon correlations in the nucleus a and @xmath58 is the density matrix of the correlated pair which we set equal to the light cone density matrix of the deuteron@xcite : @xmath59 note that the factorization of the nuclear density matrix to the correlation and @xmath56 density matrices is specific for the short - range two - nucleon correlation approximation . in this approximation",
    "it is assumed that the singular character of @xmath60 potential at short distances ( existence of repulsive core ) defines the main structure of the nucleon momentum distribution in src and it is less affected by the collective interaction with the @xmath61 nuclear system .",
    "notice that the expression in eq.([hmlc ] ) is the light cone analog of the approximated spectral function used in ref.@xcite , where the validity of two - nucleon correlation approximation is demonstrated comparing the prediction of nonrelativistic analogue of eq.([lcsf2n ] ) with the exact calculations of spectral function of @xmath62 nucleus and infinite nuclear matter .    to obtain the density matrix of the recoiling @xmath56 system , additional physical assumptions are required .",
    "however the fact that we are interested in the cross section integrated over a wide range of the missing energy allows us to simplify the eq.([lcsf2n ] ) by neglecting the momentum of the recoiling @xmath56 system ( src at rest approximation ) : @xmath63    inserting eq.([srcrest ] ) into eq.([lcsf2n ] ) one obtains the following expression for the light cone spectral function in the high missing momentum range : @xmath64 it is worth noting that the above approximation is justified based on the observation of ref.@xcite that it correctly predicts the position of the maximum in the missing energy distribution at fixed values of missing momenta .",
    "therefore , in regime in which the integration over the wide range of missing energies is allowed , eq.([sfunrest ] ) represents a valid approximation of nuclear spectral function at the src domain .",
    "the same model was also used to describe the inclusive nucleon and pion production in kinematics forbidden for scattering off a free nucleon @xcite and electroproduction@xcite reactions from nuclei at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .      the next quantity which is needed to calculate the quasielastic @xmath1 cross section in eq.([pwia ] )",
    "is the differential cross section of @xmath8 elastic scattering .",
    "for @xmath67 we use the phenomenological parameterization of the free pp elastic cross section .",
    "we assumed a combination of @xmath7-parameterization at @xmath68 presented in ref.@xcite and @xmath69-parameterization in the form suggested in ref@xcite : @xmath70\\cdot f(s,\\theta_{c.m . } )    \\label{pp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73)^{-2}$ ] .",
    "the function @xmath74 is used for further adjustment of the phenomenologically motivated parameterization to the experimental data at @xmath75@xcite .",
    "the main quantity in which we are interested is the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath1 quasielastic cross section at fixed - large c.m .",
    "angles and high momentum transfer .",
    "the reason of this choice is twofold : first , the @xmath4-dependence naturally expresses the sensitivity of the @xmath1 cross section to the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function which will be discussed below ; second , as it will be demonstrated in the section [ iif2 ] the @xmath4 variable is not sensitive to the soft initial and final state reinteractions of energetic protons with target nucleons .",
    "thus its distribution will largely reflect the distribution of the nucleon within the src without substantial modification due to initial and final state interactions .    in figure 2",
    "we present the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath76 cross section calculated for different values of incoming proton momenta .",
    "the calculations are within the pwia framework described above . here",
    "angle of the @xmath77 scattering is restricted to @xmath78 .",
    "the calculation is done for @xmath79 target using harmonic oscillator momentum distribution @xmath80 in eq.([mf ] ) and high momentum tail of the deuteron wave function calculated , using the nn paris potential in eq.([hmlc ] ) , with @xmath81 .    elastic pp scattering off a proton at rest corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "as can be seen from figure 2 , most of the strength is at @xmath82 which corresponds to a scattering off a proton with momenta in the direction of @xmath83 .",
    "this is a quantitative illustration of the discussion in the introduction : the @xmath8 cross section on bound proton scales with the total pp c.m .",
    "energy as @xmath84 , therefore the @xmath1 cross section is dominated by smaller @xmath4 .",
    "one can clearly observe a double peak structure of the @xmath4-distributions .",
    "the first peak , closer to @xmath40 , is due to scattering off a proton in the fermi sea eq.([mf ] ) .",
    "the other peak , at even lower @xmath4 values , is due to the scattering off the src eq.([lcsf2n ] ) .",
    "as the incoming energy increases , one can see the shift of the strength to the lower @xmath4-range which means more and more scattering off target protons with high fermi momenta aligned in the direction of the incoming proton momentum @xmath85 .",
    "this shift shows the onset of the regime where one expects to probe short - range nucleon correlations in the nucleus .",
    "this picture demonstrates the selectivity of hard @xmath1 reactions to the large values of the bound nucleon momenta in the nucleus , predicted originally in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculations above were done within pwia , using @xmath8 parameterization ( eq.([pp ] ) ) for the scattering off a free proton .",
    "two basic nuclear effects that can obscure the expected @xmath4-dependence are the modification of the bound protons in the nuclei and the initial and final state interactions of incoming and scattered protons respectively .",
    "we consider possible binding modifications of the bound nucleon structure which are consistent with the in medium deep - inelastic ( dis ) nucleon structure functions measured using lepton - nucleus scattering - phenomenon known as the `` emc effect '' @xcite .",
    "one of the mechanisms that can account for the observed modification of dis structure function is the suppression of point - like configurations ( plc ) in a bound nucleon as compared to a free nucleon @xcite .",
    "the plc are small sized partonic configurations in the nucleons which due to the color screening are weakly interacting objects . in the color screening model of emc@xcite ,",
    "the binding of the nucleonic system results a suppression of the nucleon s plc component .",
    "this suppression does not lead to a noticeable change in the average characteristics of a nucleon in the nucleus .",
    "however , it is sufficient to account for the observed emc effect in dis scattering from nuclei .",
    "since the high momentum transfer @xmath8 elastic scattering is mainly due to the scattering off a plc in the protons , the expected suppression of plc will reduce the cross section of @xmath8 scattering off bound proton .",
    "this suppression can be estimated by multiplying the free @xmath8 cross section of eq.([pp ] ) by the factor @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the average nuclear binding energy and @xmath88 is a parameter that characterize a typical excitation of the bound nucleon .",
    "the @xmath89-dependence in eq.([delta ] ) is due to the fact that in the wave function of a nucleon the plc dominate at sufficiently high values of the momentum transfer @xcite ( @xmath90 ) . as follows from eq.([delta ] ) the @xmath91 correction tends to reduce the expected @xmath4-shift shown in figure 1 , since it introduces additional @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) dependence , which softens the @xmath94 dependence of the @xmath8 cross section in eq.([pwia ] ) .",
    "note that a similar suppression is expected within the rescaling model of the emc effect @xcite ) . on the other hand in a number of models of the emc effect , such as pion and binding models ( for review see @xcite ) the shift to @xmath82",
    "is amplified as compared to the multinucleon calculation@xcite .",
    "thus , our estimation within the color screening model can be considered as the upper limit of possible suppression due to binding nucleon modification .",
    "using eqs.([pwia],[sfunrest],[pp],[delta ] ) the calculated cross section is shown in figure 3 as a function of @xmath4 . as figure 3 shows , the considered medium modification effect suppresses the high momentum strength of the cross section , since it corresponds to the larger virtualities of the bound nucleon , which are more sensitive to the plc structure of nucleon .",
    "however , the suppression does not diminish the expected downward shift of the @xmath4-distribution .",
    "it would require very unreasonable modifications of the bound nucleon structure ( contradicting the emc effects in dis ) to make the @xmath4-shift ( to the @xmath95 region ) completely vanish .      the major nuclear effect which can obscure the information on src are the initial and final state interactions ( isi ,  fsi ) of the incident and outgoing protons in the nuclear medium .",
    "since the momenta of incoming and two outgoing protons are above a few gev / c one can calculate these rescatterings in eikonal approximation .    for bound nucleons with small momenta @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where the scattered and the knocked - out protons reinteract with uncorrelated nucleons , we apply the conventional glauber approximation to calculate the small angle rescatterings .",
    "this is justified since in these cases the spectator nucleons can be considered as a stationary scatterers . integrating over a wide range of the missing energy of the @xmath1 reaction allows to simplify further the calculation of isi / fsi using the probabilistic approximation of ref.@xcite , which accounts for all orders ( single , double , etc ) of the soft @xmath98 rescatterings .",
    "however , the above approximation can not be used for the bound protons in src ( which have a large value of fermi momentum ) . there , the spectator nucleon can not be treated as a stationary scatterer and therefore the glauber approximation is not valid ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to calculate the initial and final state rescatterings in this case we assume that for incoming and outgoing protons the first rescattering most probably happens with the partner nucleon in the src .",
    "indeed , as it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite , because of the large virtuality of interacting nucleon in src the distance of the first soft reinteraction after the point of hard interaction is less than @xmath99  fm and it decreases with the increase of @xmath89 and @xmath100 . within the framework of two - nucleon correlation model one can account for the soft rescatterings in the src using the calculation of @xmath101 reaction in generalized eikonal approximation  ( gea ) , ref.@xcite . using the gea we only calculate the single rescatterings of the incoming and knocked - out protons with the correlated nucleon ( figure 4  b , c , d ) .",
    "the main feature of the gea is that it accounts for the nonzero values of spectator nucleon momentum ( it does not treat the spectator as a stationary scatterer as being done in the conventional eikonal approximation ) .",
    "this feature is especially important in the src region since in this case the correlated nucleon momenta are large and can not be neglected .",
    "the effect of the rescatterings in the src ( in the range of @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) can be accounted for by introducing a correction factor @xmath104 which multiplies the src spectral function of eq.([sfunrest ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath104 as follows : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the pwia amplitude , and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the single rescattering amplitudes corresponding to @xmath110 scattering shown in figure 4 . to obtain the @xmath111 s we use the rescattering amplitudes for the @xmath112 reaction calculated in ref.@xcite : @xmath113 where j(n)=b(1),c(1),d(-1 ) .",
    "@xmath114 is the amplitude of the @xmath8 hard scattering which , within the factorization approximation , cancels in @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath115 is the amplitude of a small angle ( soft ) @xmath98 scattering , @xmath116 can be either proton or neutron .",
    "@xmath117 is the deuteron wave function and @xmath118 accounts for the distortion due to fsi ( see ref.@xcite ) .    for higher order rescatterings we applied the probabilistic approximation of ref.@xcite which we used already in the case of small fermi momenta",
    "this is justified since in the kinematics of two - nucleon src the second and higher order rescatterings happen outside of the src .",
    "it is worth noting that the error originating from the last approximation is rather small since for the intermediate size nuclei ( @xmath119 ) the overall contribution of higher order rescatterings in the considered kinematics of the @xmath1 reaction is small ( a few percent as compared with the single rescattering contribution @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the major qualitative feature of reinteractions with uncorrelated nucleons , in high energies , is the existence of the approximate conservation law for the light cone momenta of interacting particles@xcite .",
    "namely , for energetic particles small angle soft reinteractions do not change the @xmath4- distribution .    to demonstrate this",
    "let us consider the propagation of fast nucleon with momentum @xmath120 through the nuclear medium .",
    "after the small angle reinteraction of this nucleon with a nucleon in the nucleus with momentum @xmath121 , the energetic nucleon still maintains its high momentum and leading @xmath122-direction having now a momentum @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "the other nucleon momentum after the collision is @xmath125 .",
    "the energy momentum conservation for this scattering allows us to write for the `` @xmath4 '' component : @xmath126 the change of the @xmath127 ( `` @xmath25 '' ) component due to rescattering can be obtained from eq.([claw ] ) : @xmath128 which means : @xmath129 in eq.([dal ] ) we use the conditions @xmath130 which is well satisfied in the small angle reinteractions since @xmath124 .",
    "thus , with the increase of the incident energy a new approximate conservation law is emerging : @xmath127 is conserved by isi / fsi .",
    "the uniqueness of the high energy rescattering is in the fact that although both the energy and the momentum of the nucleons are distorted by the rescattering , the combination of @xmath131 is almost not affected . in the same way",
    "the rescattering of the incoming and two outgoing protons in the ( p,2p ) reaction conserve the reconstructed @xmath4-component of the target proton .",
    "therefore the @xmath4-distribution measured in @xmath1 reaction reflects well the original @xmath4-distribution of the target proton in the nucleus .",
    "a numerical estimate of this conservation will be presented in the next section .    to complete the discussion on isi / fsi",
    "we should mention that for incident proton momenta exceeding @xmath132 the glauber approximation overestimates the absorption of protons if compared with the data of ref.@xcite .",
    "the overestimate of the absorption in these experiments is attributed to the color transparency ( ct ) phenomena , in which it is assumed that the hard @xmath77 primary process in the @xmath1 reaction is dominated by the interaction of protons in the point like @xmath133 configurations . as a result , immediately before and after the hard interaction the color neutral plc has a diminished strength for isi / fsi reinteraction . since the plc is not an eigenstate of qcd hamiltonian ( free nucleons have a finite size ) the interaction strength will evolve to the normal hadronic interaction strength in parallel with the evolution of plc to the normal hadronic size during the propagation of the fast proton in the nuclear medium .",
    "we estimate the ct phenomenon within the quantum diffusion model of ref.@xcite . this model which describes reasonably well@xcite the data @xcite assumes the following amplitude for the @xmath134 soft interaction : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the slope of elastic @xmath60 amplitude , @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) is the sachs form factor and @xmath139 .",
    "the last factor in eq.([f_nnct ] ) accounts for the difference between elastic scattering of plc and average configurations , using the observation that the @xmath89-dependence of @xmath140 is roughly that of @xmath141 and that @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the rms radius of the hadron .    in eq .",
    "( [ f_nnct ] ) @xmath144 is the effective total cross section for the plc to interact at distance @xmath145 from the hard interaction point and @xmath146 is the pn total cross section .",
    "the quantum diffusion model  @xcite predicts : @xmath147 where @xmath148 , with @xmath149 . here",
    "@xmath150 is the average squared transverse size of the configuration produced at the interaction point . in several realistic models considered in ref.@xcite",
    "it can be approximated as @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "note that due to expansion , the results of the calculations are rather insensitive to the value of this ratio whenever it is much less than unity . for numerical calculations we assumed @xmath153 as was chosen to describe the nuclear transparencies from @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath154 @xcite experiments ( see comparisons in ref.@xcite ) .    in figure 5 we compares the prediction of quantum diffusion model for nuclear transparency @xmath155 with the data of the eva experiment@xcite .",
    "the transparency @xmath155 is defined as the ratio of the @xmath1 cross section calculated using pwia , color screening and rescattering effects to the cross section calculated within pwia only .",
    "the comparison shows that one has a fair agreement with the data up to 9 gev / c incoming proton momenta ( note that one expects that the probabilistic model of rescattering to work within @xmath156% accuracy ) .",
    "the decrease of the experimental values of transparency can be understood in terms of the interplay of the hard and soft component in the amplitude of high momentum transfer pp scattering@xcite which is not incorporated in the current calculations . since in the further analysis",
    "we will concentrate only in the region of incoming proton momenta @xmath157 where this interplay does not play a role , we will use the simple formulae of eqs.([f_nnct],[sigma_ct ] ) for numerical estimations . the detailed analysis of the energy dependence of the nuclear transparency , @xmath155 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in the following chapter we discuss the results of the model presented in chapter ii , for several nuclear observables that can be measured in the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "we are particularly interested in two kinds of information : how the substructure of high - momentum transfer @xmath8 scattering reveals itself in the nuclear reaction and what kind of information one can infer about short - range nuclear structure from these reactions . for numerical calculations in this chapter",
    "we apply the kinematics of eva experiment@xcite . because of the multidimensional character of the kinematical restrictions the numerical calculations are implemented through the monte carlo calculation .",
    "furthermore , we will present the cross sections in arbitrary units since we are interested mainly in the shapes of the @xmath4 and @xmath158 dependence of the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "the power law energy - dependence of the hard elastic @xmath8 scattering cross section is the signature of the dominance of quark - gluon degrees of freedom in the high - momentum transfer scattering ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as was predicted in ref.@xcite if this strong energy - dependence ( @xmath5 ) exists in the nuclear medium it will amplify the contribution to the cross section coming from the scattering off deeply bound protons .",
    "these protons have a large momentum in the direction of the incoming proton .    since the cross section for the high - momentum transfer scattering of incoming proton off the bound proton at fixed and large @xmath21 is roughly proportional to @xmath159 ( see eqs.([pwia]-[pp ] ) ) , an observation that reflects the sensitivity of @xmath1 reaction to the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function is the shift of the @xmath4-spectra to the lower @xmath4 values . to demonstrate this sensitivity , in figure 6 we represent the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath1 reaction cross section assuming different @xmath7-dependences of the cross section for hard @xmath160 scattering .",
    "these calculations are merely for illustration of the connection between the s - dependence and the @xmath4-shift .",
    "figure 6 confirms that the larger is the negative power of @xmath7-dependence for the hard @xmath8 scattering the larger is the average longitudinal momentum of the interacting bound nucleon ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-shift also produces an excess of the total longitudinal momentum of the final outgoing protons as compared to the initial longitudinal momentum @xmath85 .",
    "one can characterize this excess through the variable : @xmath161 which will increase as the power of the hard @xmath8 scattering cross section increases . in figure 7",
    "we show the calculated @xmath162-dependence of the cross section for different assumed s - dependences .",
    "the expected shift to the higher x ( lower @xmath4 ) is clearly seen in figure 7 . the x - distribution for quasielastic @xmath0 reactions peaks at @xmath163 , if one assumes no s - dependence of the elementary @xmath160 reaction . as the dependence on s increases the peak",
    "is shifted to @xmath65 which represents the nuclear `` boosting '' effect : the outgoing protons have more longitudinal momentum than the incoming momentum .",
    "it is worth noting that this effect is reminiscent of subthreshold production in nuclei , in which a very low available energy in the nuclear medium can cause dramatic changes in the cross section of the reaction .",
    "the next question we would like to address is the sensitivity of the @xmath4-shift to the existence of high momentum components in the nuclear ground state wave function . to asses",
    "this sensitivity we compare the cross sections of the @xmath1 reaction using two models for the nuclear wave function : an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) model and the two - nucleon src model of high momentum component ( hmc ) of nuclear wave function , described in section [ iic ] ( ho+hmc ) . in figure 8",
    "we present the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath1 cross section calculated within pwia at @xmath164 and @xmath165 using these two models .",
    "as figure 8 shows , even at moderate energies as @xmath166 the @xmath4- dependence shows substantial sensitivity to the high momentum structure of the nuclear wave function .",
    "thus , the measured cross section at small @xmath4 will allow us to obtain the characteristics of the high momentum tail of the wave function .    in figure 9",
    ", we show the results of the pwia calculations for transverse momentum distribution of the cross section of @xmath1 reaction .",
    "it also exhibits a sensitivity to the high momentum part of the nuclear wave function .",
    "however , as will be shown below , unlike the @xmath4-distribution the transverse momentum distribution is strongly distorted due to the initial and final state interactions .",
    "note that hereafter , for the transverse missing momentum distribution , we will consider only the @xmath167 component of @xmath158 .",
    "this restriction is related to the fact that the experimental data have better resolution for the @xmath167 component of missing momentum .      as was discussed in chapter 2 ( see eq.([dal ] ) ) one expects that the soft rescatterings with uncorrelated nucleons at high energies will conserve the @xmath4 parameter of interacting nucleons .",
    "thus the measured @xmath127-distribution of @xmath1 cross section will not be affected strongly by the isi / fsi and will reflect the original @xmath4-distribution of the target proton in the nucleus .    in figure 10",

    "the straw tubes information allowed the target identification , the measurement of the particles transverse momentum as they were bent in the axial magnetic field , and their scattering angles . the overall resolution caused by the beam",

    "the polar angles ( @xmath173,@xmath174 ) of the two outgoing protons were measured with a resolution of 7 mrad .",
    "the beams ranged in intensity from 1 to @xmath175 over a one second spill every 3 seconds .",
    "two counter hodoscopes in the beam ( only one shown in fig 12 ) provided beam alignment and a timing reference and two differential cerenkov counters ( not shown in fig 12 ) identified the incident particles .",
    "three levels of triggering were used to select events with a predetermined minimum transverse momentum .",
    "the first two hardware triggers selected events with transverse momenta p@xmath176 0.8 and p@xmath176 0.9 gev / c , for the 6 and 7.5 gev / c measurements , respectively .",

    "three solid targets , ch@xmath177 , c and cd@xmath177 ( enriched to @xmath178 ) were placed on the @xmath122 axis inside the c1 cylinder separated by about 20 cm .",
    "they were @xmath179x@xmath179 @xmath180 squares and 6.6 @xmath181 long in the @xmath122 direction except for the cd@xmath177 target which was 4.9 cm long .",
    "their positions were interchanged at several intervals in order to reduce systematic uncertainties and to maximize the acceptance range for each target . only the c target was used to extract the qe events , while the other targets served for normalizations and references .",
    "quasi - elastic scattering events , with only two charged particles in the spectrometer , were selected .",
    "an excitation energy of the residual nucleus @xmath182@xmath183 500 mev was imposed in order to suppress events where additional particles could be produced without being detected in eva . since this cut is above @xmath184 , some inelastic background , such as those coming from @xmath185 events , could penetrate the cuts and had to be subtracted .",
    "the shape of this background was determined from a fit to the @xmath186 distribution of events with extra tracks in the spectrometer .",

    "the angular range enforced by the software cut is smaller than the geometrical limits of the spectrometer ( see fig 12 ) but it ensures a uniform acceptance . since the experiment was focused on shapes and not absolute values , an acceptance correction in the @xmath195 plane is not needed .",
    "an explicit cut on the center of mass scattering angle @xmath196 was not applied on the data , however the cuts on the laboratory polar angles limit the @xmath196 to the range of 83@xmath197 to 90@xmath197 for the proton at rest kinematics .",
    "each target position corresponds to a limited polar angular range @xmath195 and @xmath4 is a strong function of @xmath198 . to cover the largest possible acceptance in @xmath4 one has to merge the measured @xmath4-distributions from different targets .",

    "figure 13 shows the measured longitudinal @xmath4-distributions at 5.9 gev / c and 7.5 gev / c together with the calculations . in the calculation we used the two - nucleon correlation model for the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function , discussed in chapter [ ii ] . for the parameter @xmath225 which defines the strength of the src in the nuclear spectral function ( eq.([sfunrest ] ) ) we used the estimate obtained from the analysis of high @xmath226 and large bjorken x @xmath227 data ref.@xcite",
    "this analysis yield @xmath228 for @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath229 per degree of freedom obtained by comparing the measured and calculated distributions at 5.9 gev / c and 7.5 gev / c ( @xmath230 and @xmath231 respectively ) confirm that the calculation and the data have the same shape .",
    "the next question we ask is whether the data allow us to understand the ingredients contributing to the strength of the @xmath4-distribution at lower @xmath4-values .",
    "first we check if the high momentum transfer elastic @xmath8 scattering off bound nucleon still attains the @xmath232 energy dependence . in figure 14",
    "we compare the calculations done using @xmath7-independent pp cross section ( triangle points ) and the @xmath8 cross section parameterized according to eq.([pp ] ) , in which @xmath233 ( solid points ) . if there was no scaling for hard @xmath8 scattering in the nuclei the @xmath4-distribution would peak around @xmath40 , as shown by the calculations with no `` s - weighting '' ( triangles ) .",
    "the data clearly show a shift to lower @xmath4 which confirms the strong s - dependence of the quasi elastic process .    next we address the question whether the strength seen at @xmath82 comes from the src in nucleus .",
    "figure 15 shows two calculated @xmath4-distributions for the incoming proton momentum of 5.9 gev / c .",
    "one distribution is calculated with the harmonic oscillator wave function only ( i.e. @xmath234 , in eq.([sfunrest ] ) ) ( triangle points ) .",
    "the second distribution is calculated with the src contribution to the high momentum tail of the nuclear wave function , described by @xmath235 ( solid points ) .",
    "the open circles are the data .",
    "it is clearly seen in the figure that the @xmath4-distribution calculated with @xmath234 does not provide sufficient strength at low @xmath4 to describe the data , and src contributions are necessary .",
    "it is important to note that both the strong @xmath7-dependence of hard @xmath8 scattering and the contribution of src are needed for agreement with the data . a mean field wave function for the nucleus would require a very unreasonable ( exponentially falling with s ) energy dependence of the @xmath8 scattering cross section , in order to explain the observed strength of the cross section at @xmath82 .",
    "moreover the agreement with the data using the same value of @xmath236 parameter obtained from electronuclear reactions indicates that we are dealing with a genuine property of the nucleus that does not depend on a specific probe .",
    "as it was discussed in sections [ ii ] and [ iii ] , we expect the transverse missing momentum of the quasielastic @xmath1 cross section to be sensitive mainly to the dynamics of isi / fsi .",
    "the studies of electro - nuclear @xmath154 reactions , in which fsi occurs through the rescattering of only one knocked - out proton demonstrated that the eikonal approximation can describe the fsi with better than 10% accuracy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the expected level of accuracy in calculations of isi / fsi in @xmath1 reactions , in which one incoming and two outgoing protons undergo the soft rescatterings , will be on the order of 15 - 20% . keeping these accuracies in mind we compare the theoretical calculations with the data checking",
    "how well the probabilistic approximation of isi / fsi can reproduce the shape of the transverse missing momentum distribution .",
    "the following kinematical constraints are imposed in the monte carlo calculations    * middle target : @xmath221 .",
    "* upstream target : @xmath220 .",
    "* @xmath237 rad ( for all target positions ) .",
    "* @xmath224 ( for all target positions ) .",
    "the calculations include all the effects discussed in the chapters 2 and 3 ( i.e. isi / fsi , emc , ct ) and the strength of the src defined with @xmath235 .",
    "figure 16 shows the comparison between the measured transverse @xmath170 distribution and the calculated distribution .",
    "the theoretical and experimental distributions are normalized to 1000 at the first bin so only the difference in shape between them is relevant .",
    "they are for the combined 5.9 gev / c and 7.5 gev / c data and the upstream target ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "see chapter 4 for the detailed procedure of combining the 5.9 gev / c and 7.5 gev / c data sets .",
    "we followed the same procedure in the calculations .",
    "figure 17 shows the similar to figure 16 comparison for the kinematics of the middle stream target ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "the calculations presented in figure 16 and 17 overestimate the data at the transverse missing momenta above @xmath240 .",
    "there are several reasons for such a discrepancy .",
    "first , one should notice that the tail of the distribution above @xmath241 is only @xmath242 of the peak value at @xmath223 .",
    "since calculation and the data are normalized at the maximum , even small discrepancy between calculation and the data at @xmath223 will reproduce a large discrepancy at large values of @xmath167 .",
    "next , this discrepancy may be the indication of the limit of applicability of the probabilistic approximation of isi / fsi . in this approximation we neglected the interference terms which may contribute at large values of transverse momenta .",
    "indeed as the complete calculation of @xmath101 reaction demonstrated@xcite the interference terms are not negligible at @xmath243 and their contribution tends to diminish the overall cross section .",
    "another reason for the discrepancy may be the fact that within the eikonal approximation , starting at transverse missing momenta ( @xmath244 ) the isi and fsi are dominated by incoherent elastic rescattering which enhance the cross section of the nuclear reaction ( see for the details ref.@xcite ) . it was observed in refs.@xcite that incoherent elastic rescatterings are much more sensitive to the ct phenomena then the nuclear absorption is .",
    "the qualitative reason is that the absorption is proportional to the total cross section of plc - n interaction , @xmath245 , while incoherent elastic rescattering is proportional to @xmath246 .",
    "thus the overestimate of the calculation may indicate that the onset of ct is stronger than it is modeled in the calculations ( see section [ ii ] ) . note that a noticeable ( @xmath247 ) change in the strength of the incoherent elastic rescattering will result only @xmath248 change of the absorption thus such a modification of the size of the ct effect will still maintain the agreement of the calculation with the transparency data of ref.@xcite .    ending the above discussion",
    "we can only conclude that the strength of the high transverse momentum distributions is generated by isi / fsi .",
    "however both improved theoretical calculation of isi / fsi and the better experimental resolution are needed for understanding the details of the dynamics behind the strength of high transverse momentum distributions .",
    "we present the theoretical analysis of the first published data on the high momentum transfer quasielastic @xmath0 reaction .",
    "first , we outline the light cone plane wave impulse approximation , in which the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function is treated within a two - nucleon short range correlation model . within the same model",
    "it was predicted in ref.@xcite that the @xmath4-distribution of the @xmath1 cross section will be shifted to the smaller values of @xmath4 thereby enhancing the contribution from src .",
    "we further develop the src model taking into account the medium modification of the bound nucleon as well as initial and final state reinteractions of the incoming and two outgoing protons in the nuclear medium , combined with the color transparency effects .    for nuclear medium modification we demonstrated that within the color screening model , which describes reasonably the available electroproduction data , the strength of the src is not obscured .",
    "furthermore we demonstrated that in the high energy regime the @xmath4-distribution of the bound proton is practically unaltered by isi / fsi . as a result the @xmath4-distribution of the @xmath0 cross section reflects the genuine distribution of the bound proton in the nucleus .",
    "we also showed that the transverse missing momentum distribution is strongly sensitive to the dynamics of initial and final state reinteractions , and discussed its potential use to study the effects related to the color transparency phenomena .",
    "in addition to the @xmath4 and @xmath158 distributions we discussed the dependence of the cross section on the total longitudinal momentum of the two outgoing protons . it indicates the existence of a nuclear `` boosting '' effect , in which the longitudinal momentum of the two outgoing protons is larger than the momentum of the incoming proton .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the new data recently obtained at eva@xcite .",
    "after briefly describing the experiment we proceed with comparison of the theoretical calculations with the data .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that the theoretical expectation of the @xmath4 shift , based on scaling in hard elastic scattering off a bound nucleon in the nucleus , is correct .",
    "the physical meaning of these shifts is that hard quasi elastic @xmath8 scattering is sensitive to the high momentum components of the nuclear wave function .",
    "one observes that a momentum tail in the nuclear wave function that is needed to explain the data is significantly larger than what is expected from the mean field approximation .",
    "the value of the two nucleon src strength needed to describe the data is in agreement with the src strength obtained from electronuclear reactions .",
    "the analysis of the transverse missing momentum distribution shows that it is very sensitive to the mechanism of isi / fsi and both improved calculations and the data are needed for understanding the details of the dynamics that generates the high transverse momentum strength .",
    "thus the studies of the transverse - momentum distribution may emerge as an additional tool for study the color transparency phenomena .",
    "part of the data related to @xmath167 distribution have not been published before .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the eva collaboration allowing us to present them in this paper .",

    "<S> we present theoretical analysis of the first data on the high energy and momentum transfer ( hard ) quasielastic @xmath0 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of hard @xmath1 reaction is calculated within the light - cone impulse approximation based on two - nucleon correlation model for the high - momentum component of the nuclear wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear effects due to modification of the bound nucleon structure , soft nucleon - nucleon reinteraction in the initial and final states of the reaction with and without color coherence have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations including these nuclear effects show that the distribution of the bound proton light - cone momentum fraction @xmath2 shifts towards small values ( @xmath3 ) , effect which was previously derived only within plane wave impulse approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this shift is very sensitive to the strength of the short range correlations in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> also calculated is an excess of the total longitudinal momentum of outgoing protons . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are compared with data on the @xmath0 reaction obtained from the eva / ags experiment at brookhaven national laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> these data show @xmath4-shift in agreement with the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison allows also to single out the contribution from short - range nucleon correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained strength of the correlations is in agreement with the values previously obtained from electroproduction reactions on nuclei . </S>"
