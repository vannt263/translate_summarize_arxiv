    "the short baseline reactor experiments , daya bay @xcite , reno @xcite , and double chooz @xcite , have been very successful in determining the electron neutrino flavor content of the neutrino mass eigenstate with the smallest amount of @xmath2 , the state usually labelled @xmath5 .",

    "recently , two of these reactor experiments , daya bay , see @xcite - @xcite and reno @xcite , have extended their analysis of their data , from just fitting @xmath21 , to a two parameter fit of both @xmath21 and an effective @xmath0 . the measurement uncertainty on this effective @xmath0 is approaching the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "so it is now a pertinent question `` what is the physical meaning of this effective @xmath0 ? ''",
    "clearly , the effective @xmath0 measured by these experiments is some combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . answering the question `` what is the combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is measured in such a short baseline reactor experiment ? '' is the primary purpose of this paper ,    the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : npz ] the @xmath22 survival probability is calculated in terms of an effective @xmath0 which naturally arises in this calculation , then this definition is applied to the short baseline reactor experiments , @xmath23 1 km / gev . in section [ sec : otherdmsqs ] , i review other possible definitions of an effective @xmath0 , including the two invented by the daya bay collaboration .",
