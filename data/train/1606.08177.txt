    "in general relativity , gravitational energy has no proper local description due to the equivalence principle .",
    "although there is a well known total energy defined by arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm ) , we need some definitions for the practical applications which involve a finite region rather than the whole space .",
    "this leads to the concept of quasi - local energy .",
    "there are many different proposals for defining quasi - local quantities , here we follow the covariant hamiltonian approach by chen , nester and tung ( cnt ) @xcite , and use the method in @xcite to determine the reference .",
    "the physical significance of the choice of reference is the choice of the _ zero - point _ value of energy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , a. substruction term ) .",
    "for a survey of the covariant hamiltonian approach one may refer to @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty for the hamiltonian approach is to find a suitable way to identify the reference .",
    "basically there are two ways to determine the reference : the first one is the `` analytic matching '' in which the reference variables are directly restricted from the physical variables , for example , in schwarzschild spacetime , one can calculate the metric and connection as the physical variables and then take the @xmath14 limit to be the reference ones @xcite .",
    "although it is sometimes convenient to do this calculation , it is not so clear as to what is the meaning of the reference one gets ; the second is the `` 4d isometric matching '' which is based on the 2-surface @xmath15 isometric embedding into a reference spacetime and the embedded surface @xmath16 have the same orientation and also the spacetime @xmath17 and the reference spacetime @xmath18 have the same time orientation and space orientation . ] and then making an extension in the `` tubular '' neighborhood of @xmath15 in the normal plane .",
    "one can identify the local 4-frame of the physical and the reference spacetime _ just on @xmath15_. for an asymptotic flat spacetime , a resonable choice of reference is minkowski spacetime , and for measuring the quasi - local _ energy _ , the corresponding displacement vector field on @xmath15 is the timelike vector field @xmath19 identical to the timelike spacetime killing vector field @xmath20 on @xmath16 of the reference spacetime through the 4d isometric matching @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we found that for a specific decomposition of @xmath19 , the result is the same as the wang - yau energy @xcite .",
    "one may refer to the surveys on the wang - yau energy @xcite .",
    "the application to kerr spacetime using this method was considered in @xcite .",
    "the results are ( i ) for @xmath21 , the critical value of the qle agrees with martinez s result @xcite for the slow rotation approximation .",
    "( ii ) the numerical results implies that qle is decreasing corresponding to increasing @xmath11 , and monotonically decreasing to the value @xmath9 w.r.t .  the spatial radius @xmath10 .",
    "( iii ) the value of the quasi - local angular momentum is the _ constant _ @xmath22 .",
    "later , tam and one of the authors found that this critical value of the qle is actually the brown - york mass ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) ( for @xmath23 ) , and also the critical point is the unique solution in the region @xmath24 for the slow rotation approximation ( the global uniqueness is still not clear ) .",
    "note that @xmath25 is the outer horizon of the kerr spacetime .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse the qle of kerr spacetime for unrestricted rotation and inside the ergosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* box 33.2 ) . ] .",
    "the situation is different from the case @xmath26 and slow rotation . for @xmath10 less than @xmath27 ,",
    "there are limits on the isometric embedding ; for non - slow rotation , there is no known theorem for positivity in some region .    as mentioned before",
    ", the qle we considered depends on the 2-surface isometric embedding into @xmath8 .",
    "there are limits on @xmath11 for the surface s isometric embedding .",
    "it is known that in the kerr spacetime , there is no event horizon for @xmath28 , and hence the singularity is naked . for @xmath23 but not small",
    ", smarr found that if @xmath29 , the gauss curvature is negative near the poles , which implies that the outer horizon can not be embeded into @xmath8 _ isometrically _ @xcite .",
    "one can imagine that when @xmath11 grows up over that limit , the horizon `` warps '' out of @xmath8 from the poles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.4 ) until the extreme limit ( @xmath30 ) , and no horizon for @xmath28 .",
    "something like tearing a sticker off a table , part of it is out but still some part stays on the table .",
    "we are interested in the limit not just for the horizon",
    ". the main results of this paper are : ( i ) the gauss curvature is positive if and only if @xmath1 ( see ) , where @xmath31 is the unique real root of @xmath32 .",
    "this also gives the limit for the isometric embedding ; ( ii ) the _ integrand _ of the critical value of the qle ( i.e.  @xmath33 ) is positive if and only if @xmath3 ( therefore the qle is positive ) .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that in a certain region @xmath13 ( see ) , the critical value of kerr qle is a minimum as the corollary from chen - wang - yau s result @xcite .    note that the three curves : the outer horizon @xmath34 , @xmath31 and @xmath6 intersect at the point @xmath7 . in",
    "the _ triangle - like _ region ( see figure 4 ) , @xmath35 for @xmath36 , the integrand @xmath33 is not always positive .",
    "that means we can not use the theorem in @xcite to prove the minimized property in that region , and also it is not mathematically proved that the qle is positive in that region .",
    "however , the numerical results imply the positivity and a monotonic decreasing property .",
    "this extends the results of @xcite into the region @xmath37 , and also generalizes the result of martinez @xcite to non - slow rotation .",
    "about the situation that the qle is decreasing corresponding to the increasing @xmath11 , we found that if we replace @xmath11 by the irreducible mass @xmath12 , the qle is monotonically increasing in @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be two oriented and time - oriented spacetimes which are considered as the physical spacetime and the reference spacetime , respectively .",
