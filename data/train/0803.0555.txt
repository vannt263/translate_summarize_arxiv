    "during the last decade , galactic magnetic fields have been observed in detail in a number of galaxies , from the grand - design and barred spirals to the dwarf irregulars @xcite .",
    "however , the role of magnetic fields in the dynamical evolution of galaxies and their interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the conditions and efficiency of the magnetic field generation process , are still not well understood .",
    "it is also unclear how the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) dynamo interplays with gas flows associated with spiral density waves @xcite . in grand - design spirals the magnetic field pitch angle adjusts to the high concentration of star formation in the spiral arms as e.g. in ngc6946 @xcite , or in perturbed ngc4254 @xcite .",
    "but in flocculent galaxies , the possibly dynamo - generated magnetic field shows a large pitch angle ( @xmath8-@xmath9 ) , that sometimes agrees with optical armlets , and sometimes not @xcite .",
    "in contrast to grand - design spirals and many barred galaxies dominated by the spiral arms there are some early - type galaxies classified by de vaucouleurs as ",
    "sa(r ) \" which are purely dominated by rings . unlike spiral arms ,",
    "galactic rings are believed to be formed by resonant accumulation of gas in the non - axisymmetric potential of galaxies @xcite . under the continuous action of gravity torques gas",
    "is driven into resonance regions whose shape and orientation can be determined by the properties of periodic orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such galaxies of ringed morphology and resonant dynamics can be excellent targets to address the above questions of galactic magnetism . without strong spiral density waves and associated streaming motions they can complete our knowledge about the dynamo process in galaxies showing no grand - design spiral patterns .    motivated by these goals we performed radio polarimetric observations of ngc4736 ( m94 ) , the nearest and largest galaxy in the sky to manifest a strong ringed morphology .",
    "classified as type ( r)s@xmath10b(@xmath11s)ab by @xcite , it shows two rings . the outer ring ( r )",
    "is a weak , diffuse , and smooth feature .",
    "but the inner pseudoring ( @xmath11s ) is a well - defined zone of intense active star formation visible in optical , h@xmath4 , uv emission @xcite , and in infrared ( fig .",
    "[ f : total ] ) and co maps @xcite .",
    "the inner ring extends to a radial distance of about @xmath12 ( 1.1 kpc ) around the galaxy ( liner ) nucleus .",
    "ngc4736 is not completely axisymmetric but has a large - scale , broad oval that may affect its internal dynamics @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the rotating oval is indeed responsible for the rings formation @xcite .",
    "the nuclear minibar , well visible in co emission as a central @xmath13 extension perpendicular to the galaxy major axis , may also participate in the ring formation process @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc4736 between 8 april and 16 may 2007 at 8.46ghz and 4.86ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in its d - array .",
    "the data obtained were reduced , calibrated , and self - calibrated with the standard aips package . the allocated",
    "observing time of 33h enabled us to get high sensitivity radio maps : in the polarized intensity we reached an rms noise level of @xmath14jy / beam at 8.46ghz in an 8@xmath36x8@xmath36 resolution map , and likewise @xmath15jy / beam at 4.86ghz in a @xmath16x@xmath16 resolution map .    to avoid the missing - spacing problem",
    ", we also made radio polarimetric observations of ngc4736 with the effelsberg 100-m telescope at frequencies of 8.35ghz and 4.85ghz .",
    "the data reduction and merging with the interferometric data were performed in a manner similar to ngc4254 @xcite .",
    "the combined maps in i , q , and u stokes parameters at both frequencies were then used to construct maps of polarized intensity , polarization position angle , position angle of observed magnetic vectors ( observed @xmath17vectors rotated by @xmath18 ) , and faraday rotation measure .",
    "the observed total radio emission of ngc4736 at 8.46ghz is clearly dominated by the galaxy s bright inner pseudoring ( fig .",
    "[ f : total]a ) and resembles the distributions of infrared , h@xmath4 , and uv emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all pronounced radio features in the ring correspond to the enhanced signal in the mid - infrared ( in colours in fig .",
    "[ f : total]a ) and must result from an intense star - formation process providing dust heating and strong radio thermal and nonthermal emission .",
    "the radio contours in the galaxy s bright bulge region ( within @xmath13 radius ) are slightly elongated in position angle p.a.@xmath1930@xmath20 .",
    "they likely correspond to the nuclear minibar seen in optical and co images ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) . outside the galaxy",
    "s bright radio disk , weak radio emission is detected from a star - forming plume ( fig .",
    "[ f : total]a ) , being another feature of the galaxy s resonant dynamics @xcite .",
    "the polarized radio emission of ngc4736 at 8.46ghz reveals a dramatically different morphology ( fig .",
    "[ f : total]b ) .",
    "it does not clearly correspond either to the inner pseudoring in the infrared emission or to the distribution of total radio emission .",
    "the degree of polarization is slightly lower in the ring ( about @xmath21 on average ) than in its close vicinity ( @xmath22 ) , and rises to about @xmath23 at the disk edges .",
    "the observed vectors of regular magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ f:3cmpi ] ) are organized into a very clear spiral pattern with two broad magnetic arms .",
    "surprisingly , the inner ring hardly influences the magnetic vectors : they seem to cross the star - forming regions without any change of their orientation .",
    "this is opposite to what is observed in grand - design spiral galaxies ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) , where the magnetic field typically follows a nearby spiral density wave .    the revealed spiral magnetic pattern at 8.46ghz ,",
    "is fully confirmed at 4.86ghz .",
    "the observed similar orientation of magnetic field vectors at both radio frequencies indicates only small faraday rotation effects in this galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "hence , the magnetic vectors presented in figure  [ f:3cmpi ] give almost precisely the intrinsic direction of the projected magnetic field ( within 7@xmath20 ) in most of the galactic regions .",
    "the observed spiral structure of the magnetic field in ngc4736 contradicts the main feature of its optical morphology : the starbursting inner pseudoring . to investigate the exact pattern of regular magnetic field without projection effects",
    ", we constructed a phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ f : phase ] ) of magnetic field vectors along the azimuthal angle in the galaxy plane versus the natural logarithm of the galactocentric radius .",
    "it confirms that the magnetic vectors cross the h@xmath4 emitting ring ( which constitutes a horizontal structure in fig .",
    "[ f : phase ] ) without changing their large pitch angle of 35@xmath24 . the two broad magnetic spiral arms ( sect .",
    "[ s : obs ] ) clearly emerge from close to the galactic centre , at azimuths of about @xmath25 and @xmath26 . inside the inner ring , around azimuths of @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", the magnetic pitch angle attains smaller values , from @xmath25 to @xmath29 , which may result from gas - flows around the central minibar ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) . despite this",
    ", the observed pattern of regular field in ngc4736 seems to be the most coherent one observed so far in spiral galaxies ( cf .",
    "the comparison of the magnetic pattern in ngc4736 with the hubble space telescope and other filtered optical images indicates further disagreement of the regular magnetic field with other galactic structures , e.g. the prominent , almost circular , long dust lane west of the centre @xcite , or spiral dust armlets ( probably of acoustic origin ) in the central part of the galaxy @xcite . outside the ring , the relation of magnetic vectors with optical , flocculent features @xcite is ambiguous , and contrary to the magnetic structure the optical features do not continue inside the ring .",
    "the kinematics of co- and hi - emitting gas near the ring is well - described by pure circular differential rotation with a velocity of about 200kms@xmath30 and small residuals , typically less than about 10kms@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this assures that galactic shearing motions in the vicinity of the inner ring are strong .",
    "hence , the observed magnetic spiral could result from a _ pure _ mhd dynamo action that develops without support from spiral density waves ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) .",
    "the strongest observational test for the origin of the galactic magnetic field is the distribution of faraday rotation measure ( rm ) , which is sensitive to the sense of direction of the magnetic field .",
    "magnetic fields produced locally by ejections from stars or by small - scale mhd dynamos , compressed in shocks or stretched by gas shearing flows , yield random fields and incoherent ( changing sign ) rm patterns .",
    "only the large - scale dynamo can induce unidirectional magnetic field and produce a coherent rm pattern on the galactic - scale .",
    "the typical rm values observed in ngc4736 ( fig .",
    "[ f : rm ] ) are small , about @xmath3150radm@xmath7 , reaching locally @xmath32radm@xmath7 . as the galaxy is located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath33 ) the influence of the milky way on observed rm could be omitted .",
    "globally , ngc4736 shows a large area of statistically positive rm in the nw part of the galaxy and negative rm in the se one .",
    "this gives a strong argument for a large - scale mhd dynamo working in this object .    from maps of total and polarized emission and the direction of magnetic field vectors corrected for faraday rotation",
    "we derive `` magnetic maps '' @xcite - the strength of total , random , and regular magnetic field throughout the galaxy plane , corrected for projection effects . in calculations",
    "we assume equipartition between the energy of the magnetic field and cosmic rays ( cr ) with an @xmath17=300 mev cutoff in the cr proton spectrum , the energy ratio @xmath34=100 of cr protons and electrons , and an unprojected synchrotron disk thickness of @xmath35=500 pc .",
    "the thermal emission is separated from the observed radio intensity assuming a non - thermal spectral index of 0.9 . the total magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ f : mmaps]a ) is strongest in the galactic centre and in the starbursting ring where its strength varies from 18@xmath5 g to even 30@xmath5 g .",
    "the field is dominated by the random component ( fig .",
    "[ f : mmaps]b ) which roughly correlates with star - forming regions of h@xmath4 emission , as also seen in other galaxies .",
    "contrary to the random component the regular magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ f : mmaps]c ) is strongest in the southern part of the ring and in the regions outside the ring , reaching locally 13@xmath5 g .",
    "these local values are similar to the largest ones found in the non - barred late - type spirals @xcite .    the mean total and regular field within the radio extent of ngc4736 ( of @xmath193@xmath365 ) is 17@xmath5 g and 10@xmath5 g , respectively .",
    "these mean values are much larger than the averages found for spiral galaxies of various types .",
    "our estimates of magnetic field strengths for ngc4736 depend somewhat on assumptions given above .",
    "if instead of equipartition , pressure equilibrium is assumed ( yielding minimum stable magnetic field ) , its strength is lowered by about 25% .",
    "the magnetic field may vary by the same amount if the values of @xmath17 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are varied independenty by 50% .",
    "we thus conclude that the mhd dynamo in ngc4736 must be very efficient .",

    "we have shown that the spiral pattern of regular magnetic field lines in ngc4736 is not coupled to any gas distribution features or recognized gas flows and can be of pure dynamo origin , unlike those of grand - design spirals ( sect .",
    "[ s : dynamo ] ) . the map of faraday rotation ( fig .",
    "[ f : rm ] ) confirms that some large - scale dynamo must be at work .",
    "if an evolving freely dynamo , without strong support from spiral density waves , produces a spiral field like that seen in ngc4736 , then such a dynamo could also explain magnetic spiral patterns found in several flocculent galaxies lacking obvious spiral density waves ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) .",
    "observations of ngc4736 can also help in understanding the spiral magnetic field revealed in the area of the circumnuclear ring of ngc 1097 @xcite , a barred spiral galaxy , strongly interacting with a nearby companion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to a recent interpretation @xcite , the nuclear magnetic spiral in this galaxy is coupled to extraplanar gas .",
    "such an explanation does not seem likely for the spiral magnetic field in ngc4736 due to the very coherent magnetic pattern and small depolarization effects in the ring . also , ngc4736 is a relatively isolated galaxy , suggesting that internal dynamics play a more important role .",
    "the spiral fields around the star - forming rings in both galaxies could therefore be of different origins .",
    "but the alternative scenario that the structure of the magnetic field in the center of ngc1097 may be dominated by a pure dynamo action ( as in ngc4736 ) could also be valid .",
    "indeed , unlike the bar region and beyond , strong density waves in ngc1097 are largely absent inside the circumnuclear ring .",
    "the high efficiency of the dynamo amplification process in ngc4736 is surprising for such an early - type object , because in another early - type spiral , the sombrero galaxy ngc4594 , the magnetic field is four times weaker and reaches locally 6@xmath5 g in the total and only 3@xmath5 g in the regular component @xcite .",
    "the cause for this discrepancy may lie in different galaxy evolutions . while ngc4594 has a classical bulge , ngc4736 contains a prototypical pseudobulge @xcite , with different srsic index @xmath37 in the luminosity profile @xmath38 , and a larger flattening , revealing much more regular ( disky ) rotation .",
    "thus the secular evolution of ngc4736 , which also led to formation of the starbursting pseudoring , might affect the magnetic field generation and evolution , and account for the observed difference between the two galaxies .",
    "the reported large pitch angle of the regular magnetic field in ngc4736 ( @xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ f : phase ] ) demands special conditions for the dynamo to be set - up . according to the mhd simulation by @xcite , in typical spiral galaxies the large pitch angles ( @xmath39 ) are supported by spiral density waves .",
    "these are , however , weak in ngc4736 , and in the region of its inner ring they become almost circular . for @xmath40-dynamos with @xmath4-quenching one",
    "has a dependence of the magnetic pitch angle @xmath41 on the turbulent diffusivity @xmath42 , the disk scale height @xmath43 , the turnover radius @xmath44 in the rotation curve , and the rotational velocity @xmath45 @xcite : @xmath46 . with @xmath44=440pc and @xmath45=200kms@xmath30 (",
    "estimated from the co and hi rotation curve ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with typically used values for late - type spirals of @xmath42=1kpckms@xmath30 and @xmath43=500pc we get @xmath41=@xmath47 , much less than the observed value . to produce larger @xmath41 by a pure dynamo process",
    ", a larger magnetic diffusivity or thinner gaseous disk is necessary .",
    "the h@xmath4 and synchrotron scale heights of the ring are 370pc and 480pc , respectively ( c.f",
    "[ f : total ] ) .",
    "thus , the disk scale height is unlikely to be @xmath48300pc which leads to a needed turbulent diffusion of at least @xmath49kpckms@xmath30 .",
    "such conditions could likely be achieved in the violently star - forming inner ring with the support of e.g. a strong diffusion of crs , as in the fast parker s cosmic rays - driven dynamo @xcite .",
    "the fact that the radio polarized emission is so highly restricted to the vicinity of the starbursting ring ( fig .  [ f:3cmpi ] ) provides another stringent constraint on the dynamo action .",
    "thus , ngc4736 is an excellent object to test the most recent concepts of mhd dynamos .    in this report we demonstrated that the early - type galaxy ngc4736 has highly symmetric and strong magnetic spiral fields ,",
    "not clearly associated with the shape of the distribution of star - forming regions or with spiral density waves . the detailed processes which cause the dynamo in ngc4736 to run so efficiently and enable the generated regular field to ignore the galaxy s ringed morphology remain to be determined .",
