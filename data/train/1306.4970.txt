    "the obtained results indicate that the dispersive approach is capable of describing recently updated aleph  @xcite and opal  @xcite experimental data on inclusive @xmath0  lepton hadronic decay in vector and axial  vector channels .",
    "the values of qcd scale parameter  @xmath51 evaluated in both channels are nearly identical to each other , which bears witness to the potential ability of the developed approach to describe the experimental data  @xcite in a self  consistent way .    in further studies it would certainly be interesting to include into the presented analysis of inclusive @xmath0  lepton hadronic decay the higher order perturbative corrections and nonperturbative contributions arising from the operator product expansion , as well as to explore possible constraints on the spectral density appearing in the approach on hand .",
