    "the evolution of the star formation rate is reflected in the cosmic supernova rate ( snr ) .",
    "it should therefore , in principle , be possible to use sn observations to distinguish between star formation scenarios .",
    "even more important , core collapse sne , i.e. types ii and ib / c , provide a direct probe of the metallicity production with cosmic epoch . due to their importance as probes for early cosmological epochs , studies of high @xmath0 sne is one of the main goals for the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) ( stockman & mather @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present estimates for the expected number of observable supernovae and discuss some of the complications entering the analysis .",
    "previous studies include e.g. madau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , madau ( @xcite ) , ruiz - lapuente & canal ( @xcite ) , yungelson & livio ( @xcite ) . with respect to these",
    "our work differs in that we include information about the light curve , which allows us to predict the simultaneously observable number of sne .",
    "we divide the sne into different types with maximum absolute magnitudes accordingly .",
    "we also calculate the counts for different filters and include information about the estimated redshifts of the detected sne .",
    "section 2 describes our model .",
    "results are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the influence of dust .",
    "further discussion follows in section 5 .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath4 and @xmath5=0.5 .",
    "a problem when using luminosity densities from high @xmath0 galaxies , to calculate the sfr , is that these can be matched to wide range of sfrs , spanning from strongly peaked to flat or even increasing at @xmath61 , by adjusting the assumed extinction due to dust .",
    "madau ( @xcite ) finds , by using luminosity densities in three bands ( uv , optical and nir ) that a universal extinction @xmath7=0.1 with smc - type dust makes the best fit between a proposed sfr and the observations .",
    "this sfr shows a pronounced peak at 1@xmath82 , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this shape is predicted in a scenario where galaxies form hierarchically ( e.g. cole at al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the supernova rates by using the star formation rate and extinction @xmath7=0.1 , derived by madau ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also comment on how a higher extinction affects the rates , and if it is possible to use supernova counts to make predictions about the amount of dust .",
    "core collapse supernovae , which are thought to originate from short lived massive stars , have an evolution that closely follows the shape of the sfr . assuming an immediate conversion of these stars to supernovae renders a multiplicative factor between the star formation and the supernova rates .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 depends on the imf and the mass range of the progenitors .",
    "the uncertainties concerning the life - time of type ia progenitors make the relation between the rate of these supernovae and the star formation more difficult to model .",
    "we treat the life - time @xmath11 of the progenitor wd as a free parameter which is allowed in the range 0.3@xmath123 gyr .    in order to derive the number of sne to different limiting magnitudes",
    ", the apparent magnitude of the sne are calculated from @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the absolute magnitude in a filter @xmath15 at time @xmath16 relative to the peak of the light curve , @xmath17 is the distance modulus , @xmath18 gives the k - correction , @xmath19 is the galactic absorption , and @xmath20 is the absorption in a parent galaxy with inclination @xmath21 .",
    "the core collapse sne are divided into five different types , i.e. ib / c , iip , iil , sn1987a - type and iin , with absolute magnitudes accordingly .",
    "we model the spectra of the different sn types by blackbody curves with cutoffs at short wavelengths .",
    "the spectra are also set the evolve with time .",
    "an important feature of our model is that the sne are distributed over the light curve , and are given absolute magnitudes accordingly . with this procedure",
    "we obtain the simultaneously observable number of supernovae . in order to actually detect the sne ,",
    "a second observation has to be made after an appropriate time has passed .    the effect of the time delay between the formation of the progenitor star and explosion of type ia sne shifts the peak of the rate of these sne towards lower @xmath0 than compared to the core collapse sne . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the rates for core collapse and type ia sne .",
    "three different values for the life - time of type ia progenitors are shown , @xmath11=0.3 , 1 and 3 gyr .",
    "the rates of type ia s are normalized so that the fraction between core collapse and type ia rates matches the observed value at z=0 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the predicted number of simultaneously observable core collapse sne per arcmin@xmath3 in the m@xmath22 ( centered on 4.2@xmath1 m with @xmath23 m ) , k@xmath22 ( 2.1@xmath1 m ) , j ( 1.2@xmath1 m ) , i and r filters for different limiting magnitudes ( given in the ab system ) .",
    "also shown are the mean redshifts of the sne at the different limits and the mean redshifts in @xmath24m=0.5 magnitude bins for the k@xmath22 and m@xmath22 filters .",
    "the number of observable high @xmath0 sne increases considerably more at faint limiting magnitudes for the filters that probe longer wave - lengths .",
    "this k - correction effect is enhanced by fact that a majority of the core collapse sne has a spectral cutoff at short wave - lengths , causing these sne to drop out of the r , i , j , k@xmath22 and m@xmath22 filters at @xmath250.9 , @xmath21.4 , @xmath22.7 , @xmath25.5 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "the ngst is planned to have a detection limit of @xmath21 njy in the j and k@xmath22 bands and @xmath23 njy in the m@xmath22 band for a 10@xmath26s exposure with s / n=10 and r=3 ( ngst simulation group , 1998 ) .",
    "these fluxes correspond to ab - magnitudes of 31.4 and 30.2 , respectively . with these limits",
    "we find that the k@xmath22 band yields the highest predicted number of observable sne . in a 4@xmath274 arcmin field",
    "we predict @xmath2 47 simultaneously detectable core collapse sne in the k@xmath22 band .",
    "the numbers for the j and m@xmath22 bands are @xmath2 28 and @xmath2 41 , respectively .",
    "the mean redshift of the sne are @xmath28 1.9 in the k@xmath22 band and @xmath28 2.1 in the m@xmath22 band .",
    "the mean redshift in the faintest observable magnitude bin ( @xmath24m=0.5 mag ) for both these filters are @xmath28 2.3 .",
    "the number of simultaneously observable sne with @xmath29 is @xmath2 17 for both the k@xmath22 and the m@xmath22 filter . at",
    "even higher @xmath0 , the m@xmath22 filter is preferred due to the effects of k - correction . for sne with redshifts @xmath30 and @xmath31 we predict 1.1 and 0.09 sne in the m@xmath22 band , while the numbers for the k@xmath22 band are 0.3 and 0.02 ( using field and detection limits as above ) .",
    "these high @xmath0 estimates are based on a supernova rate derived by extrapolating the rate from @xmath32 5 .",
    "this makes the predicted numbers somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , the m@xmath22 band should detect a factor @xmath33 3 - 5 times more sne than the k@xmath22 band at these @xmath0 , independent of the actual rate .",
    "we stress that it is necessary to use filters that sample wave - lengths long ward of the ( redshifted ) spectral cutoff of the sne spectra in order to detect sne at high @xmath0 .",
    "note that the number of observable sne with @xmath0 above @xmath2 2 - 4 may be increased by the effects of gravitational magnification ( marri & ferrara @xcite ) .",
    "an hdf - like observation , covering 5 arcmin@xmath3 with observational limits of i@xmath3429 and r@xmath3429 , should contain @xmath2 1.2 and @xmath2 0.6 core collapse sn in each field .",
    "the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) reaches r@xmath226.8 using fors in 1800s exposure ( moorwood @xcite ) . with a field of 6.8@xmath276.8",
    ", one should detect @xmath2 1.5 core collapse sne .",
    "the mean redshift of these sne is predicted to be @xmath28 0.8 .",
    "about 30% and 0.8% of these have @xmath351 and @xmath352 , respectively . reaching a magnitude deeper",
    "would raise the detected number to @xmath2 3 and increase the mean redshift to @xmath28 1 . with this limit",
    "40 % and 2 % of the sne have redshifts @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "using the vlt infrared isaac instrument , which is specified to reach k@xmath3624.8 in a 2.5@xmath272.5 field ( 3600s exposure ) ( moorwood @xcite ) , will yield around 0.07 detected sne per observation ( @xmath28 0.8 ) . reaching a magnitude deeper increases the predicted number of observable sne to 0.4 per field ( @xmath28 1 ) . in the last example about 47% and 4% of the sne have @xmath351 and @xmath352 , respectively .",
    "these estimates show that ground based instruments can not compete with the ngst when it comes to detecting high @xmath0 supernovae .",
    "so far we have discussed the number of sne that are simultaneously observable during one search ( requiring two observations to actually detect the sne ) . prolonging the time coverage of a specific",
    "field increases the observed number of sne . with 4 - 6 observations per year , yielding a full coverage of the light curves",
    ", we estimate a total of @xmath2 70 sne to be detected per field with the ngst in the k@xmath22 filter .    compared to earlier published estimates",
    "we predict greater numbers for the counts . with the same extinction , madau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) predict @xmath27 sne per ngst field per year in the range 2@xmath84 .",
    "our calculations result in @xmath223 ( both k@xmath22 and m@xmath22 ) .",
    "the main reason is that we include sne observed over the whole light curve .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the detectable number of type ia sne down to different limiting magnitudes for @xmath11=0.3 , 1 and 3 gyr in the different filters .",
    "also shown is the mean redshift for the model with @xmath11=1 gyr .",
    "these results show that a change in the delay time , @xmath11 , introduces a fairly large dispersion in the predicted number of observable sne .",
    "for example , with the ngst k@xmath22 detection limit @xmath2 12 sne are predicted for the two low @xmath11 values and @xmath2 7 for @xmath11=3 gyr .",
    "this may seem as a possible observational probe to distinguish between different progenitor models .",
    "however , in next section we show that this use is hampered by the uncertainties introduced when considering alternative extinction models .",
    "there are several claims that the extinction @xmath7=0.1 , as argued for by madau  ( @xcite ) , and used here , is too low",
    ". observations of high @xmath0 galaxies , as well as the far - infrared extra - galactic background ( e.g. meurer  @xcite ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "@xcite ; sawicki & yee  @xcite ; ellingson et al .",
    "@xcite ; soifer et al .",
    "@xcite ; burigana et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicate that an extinction of @xmath370.3 could be more likely . with a high extinction it is possible that the observed peak in the uv - luminosities from the high @xmath0 galaxies is illusive and that the star formation history is more compatible with a monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "to mimic the case of a monolithic collapse , madau ( @xcite ) presents a test case where the extinction is adjusted so that a proposed monolithic sfr matches the observations . in this model",
    "he finds an extinction law that increases with redshift as @xmath7=0.011(1+@xmath0)@xmath38 .",
    "we have run our model with the monolithic extinction law in order to examine how a higher absorption a high redshifts affects the predicted rates .",
    "the rate of exploding high @xmath0 core collapse sne increases in proportion to the assumed increase in star formation in the high extinction model . due to the effects of the dust ,",
    "the observable number of sne will , however , be similar to the numbers found in the low extinction model .",
    "this is hardly surprising , because the observed supernova rate is , except for the k - correction , proportional to the observed star formation rate , which ( by assumption ) is the same in the two models . with the ngst limits , the number of detected sne in a field increases from @xmath247 in the low dust scenario to @xmath254 in the high dust scenario , using the k@xmath22 band .    since the k - corrections increase with redshift , it may",
    ", however , be possible to use a high redshift subsample of the observed sne in the k@xmath22 or m@xmath22 band as a probe for the amount of dust .",
    "using ngst limits , and only counting sne with @xmath35 2 in the low and high dust models , results in @xmath2 17 and @xmath2 32 detections , respectively ( in both bands ) .",
    "the increased star formation at high redshifts in the monolithic model makes the rate of high @xmath0 type ia sne sensitive to the choice of formation redshift , @xmath39 .",
    "allowing the formation redshift to be in to range 5 @xmath40 9 , together with the uncertainty in progenitor lifetime @xmath11 , leads to a wide dispersion in the estimated counts of type ia sne .",
    "using the ngst limits results in @xmath25 - 36 simultaneously observable type ia sne in the k@xmath22 filter .",
    "a better understanding of the properties of the dust seems necessary if the rates are to be used as probes for different progenitor scenarios .",
    "the actual amount of extinction has a large influence on the cosmic star formation rate above redshifts of the peak at @xmath411.5 .",
    "this affects the intrinsic number of supernovae and therefore also the production and enrichment of metals by core collapse sne throughout history .",
    "the number of core collapse supernovae as observed from earth is , however , less dependent on the amount of extinction , due to the fact that high intrinsic star formation rates are combined with high absorption as to match the same observational data .",
    "a more pronounced change in the derived rates would emerge if the observed uv luminosities from the high @xmath0 galaxies under - predicts the star formation due to other effects than extinction",
    ". this could be the case if a large part of the star formation takes place in low surface brightness galaxies , or if selection effects biases against the detection of galaxies with increasing redshift ( e.g. hu et al .",
    "@xcite ; ferguson @xcite ) .",
    "the rates of simultaneously detectable sne results from events over the whole light curve . using type ia s as",
    "standard candles requires observations at the peak of the light curve , i.e that a first detection is made at the rising part of the light curve .",
    "our calculations predict that the ngst will be able to simultaneously detect @xmath2 0.6 type ia s on the rising part of the light curve , of which @xmath2 0.4 and @xmath2 0.1 has redshifts @xmath351 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we have used the hierarchical model with extinction @xmath7=0.1 , and progenitor life - time @xmath11=1 gyr , in these examples .",
    "the dependence of these numbers on the progenitor life - time is , however , strong .",
    "the major sources of uncertainty in our calculations is most likely to be connected with the treatment of the dust extinction and the assumed mass range of the sn progenitors . in dahln & fransson ( @xcite )",
    "we discuss these , and other possible sources of uncertainty . in this paper",
    "we also go deeper into the details of our model and include discussions on detectability , metal production and the influence of cosmological models on the derived rates .",
    "we have found that the predicted number of core collapse sne is rather insensitive to the assumed star formation scenario , as long as the star formation is calculated to match the same observed luminosity densities .",
    "different star formation models may , however , be tested by using high redshift subsamples of core collapse sne .",
    "when it comes to the observable rates of type ia sne , we find that these are more sensitive to the star formation and dust modeling .",
    "this is due to the fact that the type ia s are less linked to the environment where their progenitors were formed .",
    "the uncertainty in the life - time of the progenitors , combined with the sensitivity on the rates to the onset of star formation in monolithic - like models , contributes to the difficulty with using type ia s as probes for either different star formation scenarios , or progenitor models .",
    "the number of core collapse sne that could simultaneously be detected with the ngst down to 1 njy ( m@xmath4231.4 ) in a 4@xmath274 arcsec field is calculated to be @xmath2 47 in the k@xmath22 band . in order to detect sne with @xmath6 2 , long wave - length filters ( i.e. m@xmath22 )",
    "should be used .",
    "this is due to k - correction .",
    "the effect of the k - correction is enhanced by the spectral cutoff , causing a majority of the sne to drop out of the shorter wave - length filters at relatively lower redshifts .",
    "the high number predicted for the counts implies that searches for these sne will be very important when it comes to the understanding of the star formation and the nucleosynthesis in the early universe .",
    "the number of simultaneously detectable type ia sne with the ngst limits are @xmath25 - 35 , depending on model .",
    "additional uncertainties widen this range even more . of the simultaneously observable type ia s ,",
    "only about 5% are at the rise of the light curve .",
