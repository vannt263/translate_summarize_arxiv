    "one of the most distinctive features of top quark which makes it so interesting is its large mass . due to this large mass",

    "on the other hand , although the cross section for @xmath7 production at international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite is about three orders less than the lhc , the very clean environment of the ilc experiments , as well as polarization of the initial beams make it an attractive platform for further and complementary investigation of top quarks .    in this work",
    "we exploit implications of unparticle physics in the pair productions of top quarks , and show how the interactions between unparticles and sm fields can be probed at the lhc with @xmath8 tev , and at ilc with @xmath9=0.5 tev by obtaining the modifications on sm predictions for the @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 production cross sections , respectively .",
    "a feature of our work worth emphasizing is that we analyze the top pair production cross sections by deriving all the expressions analytically and compute the contributions of all types of vector , tensor and scalar unparticles having three different lorentz structures .",
