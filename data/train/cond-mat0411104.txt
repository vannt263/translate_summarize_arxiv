    ". the rate at which vortices move in and out of the sample determines the magnetic creep rate .",
    "given that the magnetic relaxation is driven by thermal activation , it is rather surprising that experiments have found the creep rate to be essentially temperature independent in a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain how competing factors are able to cancel the typical arrhenius temperature dependence @xmath0 for activation over an energy barrier @xmath1 .",
    "the most prominent theoretical suggestion so far is probably the description in terms of collective creep @xcite .",
    "here we show that the lack of temperature dependence of the creep rate can be understood quite simply in terms of _ _ record dynamics__@xcite , which has recently been proposed as a general mechanism for the irreversible dynamics following a sudden quench in glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "we base our analysis on the following two experimental and numerical observations :    * for a long time glitches have been observed in the time dependences of the magnetic relaxation of type ii superconductors ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as the external magnetic field",
    "is varied , the magnetization undergoes abrupt jumps whenever vortices suddenly move in or out of the sample . * a number of studies , experimental as well as theoretical @xcite , indicates that in a broad range of not too high temperatures the vortex system exhibits many characteristic features of glassy dynamics .",
    "many  @xcite but far from all  @xcite creep experiments study the response of the external magnetic field to a sweep , including sign reversal . for simplicity , we will presently concentrate on a setup in which the external field is initially ramped at a fixed rate up to a value and then remains constant for the entire duration of the experiment .",
    "we use a three dimensional version of the restricted occupancy model ( rom)@xcite to study the response to a fixed applied magnetic field .",
    "important physical properties of the 3d layered rom model have a nearly temperature independent dynamical evolution , matching in this respect simulation results previously obtained for the same model @xcite as well as experimental results on type ii superconductors @xcite . as a strong temperature sensitivity",
    "is expected for the activated dynamics of an entirely classical model system , the mechanism behind the observed temperature independence warrants some further theoretical scrutiny .",
    "a fixed applied magnetic field can be expected to lead to a non - stationary time dependence of the internal magnetization which slowly increases from zero to about the value of the applied field .",
    "interestingly , the low temperature dynamical evolution of the response involves two types of configuration rearrangements , having widely different time scales .",
    "one type consists of rapid glitches by which the magnetization irreversibly jumps to higher values , as additional vortices enter the system .",
    "we refer to these glitches as _ quakes _ @xcite to emphasize their non - equilibrium nature , their abruptness and their dramatic effect on the state of the vortex system .",
    "the quakes are separated by much longer periods of apparent quiescence , during which the vortex system is ` searching ' for a configuration of larger stability and for a way to accommodate more vortices inside the sample .",
    "even though the total magnetization does not change , the internal spatial organization of the vortices undergoes considerable rearrangements .",
    "we argue that the slow vortex creep associated with the quakes can be analyzed through the statistical properties of record dynamics , which immediately explains the temperature independence of the creep rate@xcite for the range of temperatures for which this description is applicable . by record dynamics",
    "we mean the following .",
    "consider a stochastic time signal @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding record signal is @xmath3 , i.e. the largest value assumed by @xmath2 up to the current time @xmath4 .",
    "the physical idea behind record dynamics  @xcite is that large irreversible configurational changes in noisy systems with a macroscopic number of metastable attractors are induced by noise fluctuations of record size .",
    "similar behavior is observed in other glassy metastable systems , e.g.  gels and spin - glasses , and can be characterized statistically in a similar way @xcite .",
    "this highlights the underlying unity of non - equilibrium glassy dynamics at low temperatures and supports the possibility of a common theoretical description .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section summarizes the properties of the rom model used in the simulations .",
    "section  [ t - independence ] briefly introduces a possible mechanism  @xcite by which activated dynamics can become insensitive to the temperature in a glassy system , and demonstrates its relevance for the rom model dynamics .",
    "section  [ results ] focuses on creep rates and contains comparison with experiments .",
    "finally , section  [ summary ] presents a summary and a discussion .",
    "the two dimensional random occupancy model ( rom ) has been shown to reproduce the essential features of vortex dynamics at nonzero temperature @xcite . here",
    "we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a generalized three dimensional layered version of the rom model to capture the long time relaxation of interacting vortex matter .    in vortex matter , the length scale of the interactions can be very large compared with the average distance between ( pancake ) vortices . at high densities",
    ", this implies that each vortex interacts with many others . for layered superconductors this situation can roughly be described by two length scales : the first is the range of the interaction parallel to the planes , this is the london penetration depth @xmath5 .",
    "the second length scale is the vortex correlation length , @xmath6 , parallel to the applied field ( which we imagine to be perpendicular to the copper oxide planes for high temperature superconductors ) .",
    "the exact identification of this length scale is difficult and is likely to depend on the anisotropy of the material , the nature of the pinning , the strength of the magnetic induction and on the temperature .",
    "this length scale may be related to vortex line cutting@xcite .",
    "these length scales respectively give the horizontal and vertical lattice spacing of our model .",
    "the horizontal coarse - grained length scale @xmath7 , corresponds to the penetration depth @xmath8 of the superconducting material , and the spacing between the layers in our lattice we consider @xmath9 .",
    "smaller length scales are ignored . for our purposes",
    "this approximation is acceptable because the length scales smaller than @xmath5 seem to have little influence on the long time glassy properties of vortex matter .",
    "another limitation of the model is that it ignores the variation of @xmath5 with the temperature .",
    "as will become clear from our ensuing discussion of record dynamics , ignoring the temperature dependence of @xmath5 is not crucial for our explanation of the observed temperature plateau of the creep rate .    in a sample of a superconducting material the vortex matter behavior",
    "is determined by the competition of four energy scales @xcite : intra and interlayer vortex - vortex interaction , vortex - pinning interaction and thermal fluctuations , all of which are schematically included in the rom model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rom model is thus the following : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of vortices on site @xmath12 of the lattice . in a superconducting sample the number of vortex lines per unit area is restricted by the upper critical field ( @xmath13 ) @xcite , so in the model the number of vortices per cell can only assume values smaller than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "hence the name restricted occupancy model .",
    "moreover , as we are interested in a simulation setup that does not require magnetic field inversion and the vortex - antivortex creation is strongly suppressed , we simply consider @xmath15 .    the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) represent the repulsion energy due to vortex - vortex interaction in the same layer , and the vortex self energy respectively .",
    "since the potential that mediates this interaction decays exponentially at distances longer than our coarse - graining length @xmath5 , interactions beyond nearest neighbors are neglected .",
    "we set @xmath16 , @xmath17 if @xmath12 and @xmath18 are nearest neighbors on the same layer , and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "the third term represents the interaction of the vortex pancakes with the pinning centers .",
    "@xmath20 is a random potential and for the purposes of this work we consider that @xmath20 has the following distribution @xmath21 . the pinning strength @xmath22 represents the total action of the pinning centers located on a site . in the present work we use @xmath23 .",
    "finally the last term describes the interactions between the vortex sections in different layers .",
    "this term is a nearest neighbor quadratic interaction along the @xmath24 axis , so that the number of vortices in neighboring cells along the @xmath24 direction tends to be the same .",
    "the parameters of the model are defined in units of @xmath25 .",
    "the time is measured in units of full mc sweeps .",
    "the relationship between the model parameters and material parameters is discussed in @xcite .",
    "each individual mc update involves the movement to a neighbor site of a single randomly selected vortex .",
    "the movement of the vortex is automatically accepted if the energy of the system decreases ; if the energy of the system increases , the movement is accepted with probability @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "given that the movement of pancake vortices is restricted to the superconducting planes we only allow mc movements parallel to the planes .",
    "we have used periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the external magnetic field is modeled by the edge sites on each of the planes .",
    "the density at the edge is kept at a controlled value . during a mc sweep vortices",
    "may move between the bulk sites and the edge sites . after each mc",
    "sweep the density on the edge sites is brought to the desired value .",
    "initially the external field is increased to a desired value ( @xmath27 vortices per edge site ) by a very rapid increase in the density on the edge sites .",
    "we have here used a sweeping rate @xmath28 of 0.25 per mc sweep ( compared with @xmath29 $ ] in our previous studies @xcite ) . after this",
    "fast initial ramping the external field is kept constant , while we study how the vortices move into the sample .",
    "the age of the system , @xmath30 , is taken to be the time since the initial ramping .",
    "we have studied systems of different sizes , and obtain similar results except for very small system sizes .",
    "our key results were obtained in a system consisting of 8 layers of size @xmath31 .",
    "the model parameters used in our simulations were : @xmath32",
    "we will in this section describe how the observed plateau in the temperature dependence of the magnetic creep rate can be explained in the framework of record dynamics . let us first mention the salient features of what we mean by record dynamics . consider a stochastic signal @xmath2 with no time correlations",
    ". now derive the record signal @xmath3 .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is a monotonous piecewise constant function which only increases its value at discrete times @xmath34 , whenever @xmath2 manages to fluctuate to a value larger than any encountered previously . for our present purpose ,",
    "the most important property of the statistics of the record times @xmath34 is that the probability that exactly @xmath35 records occur during the time interval @xmath36 $ ] ( where @xmath30 is the time since the initiation ) , is to a good approximation poisson distributed on a logarithmic time scale @xcite , i.e. , @xmath37 with average number of quake events proportional to logarithmic time @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the logarithmic rate of events . to get the gist of the mathematics behind eq .",
    "( [ log_poisson_pdf ] ) ( for full detail see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we note that since the largest outcome , _",
    "i.e. _ the record , of @xmath4 independent trials is equally likely to occur at any of the @xmath4 instances in the sequence , it occurs at the first attempt with probability @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the probability @xmath41 of exactly one record in @xmath4 trials is @xmath40 , independently of the distribution of the _ underlying signal _ @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to point out that the same also holds for the general expression for @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ log_poisson_pdf ] ) .",
    "the independence of @xmath42 on the distribution of random numbers corresponds to the independence of @xmath2 on the thermal noise and will translate directly into the temperature independence of the creep rate .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that in ( glassy ) systems having a large number of dynamically inequivalent attractors , temperature independence of suitably coarse - grained dynamical variables can arise from the peculiar way in which the attractors are selected as the system evolves from a typically rather unstable initial configuration through gradually more stable ones . a similar noise insensitivity of stochastic dynamics has been observed with other types of noise , _",
    "e.g. _  in driven dynamical systems @xcite and in evolutionary dynamics@xcite .     on the system for a single realization of the pinning potential and the thermal noise in a @xmath43 lattice for @xmath44 .",

    "not the case , the dynamics would appear continuous in terms of a suitably coarse - grained time scale .",
    "conversely , the lengthening of the intervals between successive quakes signals the anticipated gradual entrenching of the dynamics into dynamically more stable configurations .    also important",
    "is that the overwhelming majority of the observed glitches lead to states with a higher number of vortices .",

    "we approximate the pdf for the number of vortices @xmath56 which enter during a given quake event ( see insert fig .",

    "[ log - poisson ] .",
    "it is important to mention that the mc dynamics does overcome plenty of positive energy barriers , @xmath67 , through thermal activation for temperatures in the range @xmath68 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered fewer mc updates correspond to @xmath67 and for the lowest temperatures mc steps involve @xmath69 only@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the record dynamics remains essentially temperature independent for @xmath70 .",
    "the agreement is encouraging and suggests that the process of vortex penetration into the sample can be described in terms of a poisson process with logarithmic time argument , for short the log - poisson process .",
    "we also note that the log - poisson statistics covers the temporal distribution of the quakes but has nothing to say on the size distribution of the jumps , _",
    "i.e. _  the number @xmath56 of vortices entering during a single event .",
    "this stochastic quantity could in principle introduce additional time and temperature dependencies",
    ". however , as mentioned , the insert of fig .",
    "[ log - poisson ] shows that for a very broad parameter range this is not the case .",
    "accordingly , the creep rate obtained by convoluting the distribution of the quake sizes and the log - poisson distribution of number of quakes will also be temperature independent .",
    "the link between record statistics and the stochastic dynamics of a glassy system is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite on the basis of several idealized physical assumptions .",
    "the first element is the existence of a large number , in principle a continuum , of attractors .",
    "these are sets of configurations clustered around a local energy minimum and supporting equilibrium - like reversible thermal fluctuations .",
    "by contrast , attractor changes  our quakes  are assumed to be irreversible on the time scale at which they occur .",
    "the exact nature of the quakes is not entirely clear in our system . at intermediate temperatures they are related to activation over barriers and the jump in @xmath45",
    "is associated with a increase in the energy of the interacting vortices . however , at the lowest temperatures there is not sufficient thermal energy available for the system to climb over energy barriers .",
    "the thermal fluctuations are only able to push the vortices along equipotential trajectories or to lower potential energy configurations . in this regime",
    "the vortex motion is hindered by jamming and the quakes are of a mechanical nature @xcite .",
    "an interpretation in terms of record dynamics implies that the dynamical bottlenecks overcome by fluctuations are determined by the actual noise history , and not predetermined in a static fashion . for other model systems  @xcite ,",
    "the validity of the assumed linkage between noise records and barriers was confirmed by considering white noise perturbations drawn from a distribution with finite support , _",
    "e.g. _  a box distribution , and by then studying the properties of the selected attractors as a function of the maximum size of noise .",
    "record - induced dynamics has thus a number of testable predictions , the most interesting of which is , for our purposes , the logarithmic time dependence and the striking temperature independence of the number of quakes occurring in the time interval @xmath71 $ ] , which are shown in the following section .",
    "let us now turn to the dependence on time and temperature of the total number of vortices in the sample . at time",
    "@xmath72 we rapidly increases the external field from zero up the value @xmath73 ( see section ii ) .",
    "the vortex density of the bulk sites gradually increases as vortices move in from the boundary .",
    "[ ptb ]   the vortex number is a piecewise linear function of @xmath74 . for @xmath75",

    "as anticipated , the time dependence is temperature independent for all but the highest temperatures .",
    "one can identify three different temporal regimes separated at times @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for the remaining of this paper we will focus our analysis on the intermediate regime @xmath79 ( and choose @xmath80 ) .",
    "our reason for this is that at @xmath81 vortex interactions become essential through out the entire system .",

    "this approach allows us to interpret the observed temperature independence of the creep rate as a generic property of the dynamics of records obtained from the underlying fluctuating sequence . to establish the temperature independence of the creep rate we do not need to know the detailed nature of the quantity being gradually maximized . nor do we need a description of the intermittent vortex quakes which are responsible for the abrupt changes in the number of vortices . all we make use of is the assumption , supported by the simulated model , that the abrupt glitches in the number of vortices inside the sample can be interpreted as arising from the records of some stochastic process .",
    "we showed that the simulated creep rate behaves in a way very similar to published experimental data for ybco .",
