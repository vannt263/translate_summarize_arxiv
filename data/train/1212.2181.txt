    "a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) is a path on a lattice with the spatial restriction that the path must not visit the same site more than once  @xcite .",
    "a saw is used as a model of chain polymers , because the above restriction represents the excluded volume effect .",
    "lattice protein models such as the g model  @xcite and the hp model  @xcite have played important roles in the construction of the funnel picture of the energy landscape  @xcite , which forms the basic theoretical understanding of protein folding .",
    "many sophisticated methods have been developed to analyze the thermodynamic properties of a lattice protein .",
    "the multi - self - overlap ensemble ( msoe )  @xcite , which is an extended version of the multicanonical monte carlo method  @xcite , is one of the best methods to find a ground state and calculate thermodynamic properties of a long lattice protein .",
    "the main idea of the msoe is that the self - avoiding condition is relaxed so that some intersections of a chain are allowed . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the idea to the enumeration problem of finite - step saws .",
    "besides having many applications like polymers , the saw itself has many interesting asymptotic behaviors of infinite steps and has been studied by physicists , chemists , and mathematicians for a long time . in spite of great efforts ,",
    "major parts of proposed asymptotic behaviors have not been solved in the rigorous mathematical sense and remain as conjectures .",
    "enumeration of @xmath0-step saws is a famous unsolved problem and the exact number of two - dimensional saws is known up to only 71 steps  @xcite .",
    "the total number of @xmath0-step saws is written as @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is counted as @xmath4 which is larger than avogadro s constant ( @xmath5 ) . since @xmath2 increases exponentially with @xmath0 , it will soon be impossible to deal with all components of @xmath0-step saws on a computer and we have to use statistical methods for approximate enumeration of @xmath2 with large @xmath0 .    in our study ,",
    "in order to estimate @xmath2 with large @xmath0 accurately , we developed new enumeration methods using multicanonical simulations of the following two kinds of statistical mechanical models : the domb - joyce model  @xcite for generalized random walks and the g model  @xcite for lattice proteins . by using our methods",
    ", we were able to estimate the number of saws on a square lattice up to 256 steps with error estimation .",
    "we denote points on a @xmath6-dimensional cubic lattice by @xmath7 and a set of points by a path @xmath8 .",
    "an @xmath0-step random walk ( rw ) is defined by @xmath9 starting from the origin of the lattice with the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the universal set of rws as @xmath11 .",
    "since each site has @xmath12 nearest neighbors , the total number of @xmath0-step rws is exactly @xmath13 . in the case of a saw , a further constraint imposed by @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and we denote the universal set of saws as @xmath16 .",
    "this constraint makes it difficult to exactly count the total number of @xmath0-step saws @xmath2 .",
    "two enumeration methods proposed in this paper are based on the same sampling technique called the multicanonical monte carlo method  @xcite . if we define hamiltonian @xmath17 as a function which maps a path on a @xmath6-dimensional lattice to energy , @xmath18",
    ", we can introduce an energy structure into @xmath11 and @xmath16 . using the multicanonical method",
    ", we can estimate the number of states @xmath19 accurately over a wide range of energy , as we will explain in the following sections .    introducing a weight @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 into the markov chain monte carlo",
    ", we define the transition probability from a path @xmath22 to another path @xmath23 @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are energy of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "to calculate thermodynamic values at specific inverse temperature @xmath27 , we can use the metropolis method with @xmath28 . in the multicanonical method ,",
    "the energy space of @xmath20 is divided into @xmath29 bins and inverse temperature @xmath30 is introduced to each bin .",
    "@xmath20 of the @xmath31th bin is set to be proportional to @xmath32 , and joint parameters @xmath33 are introduced to connect @xmath20 continuously at the boundaries of the bins . by modifying @xmath30 and @xmath34",
    ", we determine @xmath20 to be approximately proportional to the inverse of the number of states @xmath35 . if the number of energy levels @xmath36 is finite and @xmath29 is equal to @xmath36 , which is true throughout our study , the multicanonical method is identical to the entropic sampling  @xcite .    in our study , we built up @xmath20 using the wang - landau method  @xcite , the detailed procedure of which is given in the appendix .",
    "if we give a transition probability using this @xmath20 , the markov chain monte carlo produces a flat histogram @xmath37 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath38 with high accuracy over a wide range of the energy scale . in order to estimate the number of states , @xmath19",
    ", we need to introduce an absolute scale . in sec .",
    "[ sec : go ] and [ sec : dj ] , we introduce two different absolute scales .      to efficiently sample saws from @xmath16 , we can use the multi - self - overlap ensemble ( msoe )  @xcite , which is an extended version of the multicanonical method . relaxing the self - avoiding conditions ,",
    "the msoe makes it possible to explore the configuration space faster than the case that the self - avoiding conditions are strictly kept despite the extra configuration space .",
    "the reason for the fast exploration is that transition paths from one saw to another increase via configurations with one intersection or more .",
    "let @xmath39 be the number of the overlaps of a path .",
    "if @xmath40 points of a path @xmath41 are on the same site , we define that there are @xmath42 overlaps on that site .",
