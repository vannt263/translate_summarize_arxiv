    "urban vegetation is receiving a significant amount of attention from researchers in recent years .",
    "this interest stems from its impacts on the environment , affecting the pedestrian comfort and mitigating the negative health effects of the air pollution @xcite .",
    "microscale modelling using the computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) proved to be an indispensable tool for assessing the impacts of the vegetation in the urban settings .",
    "some numerical studies focused only on the effects of the vegetation on the flow @xcite or on the thermal comfort of the pedestrian @xcite .",
    "others investigated pollutant dispersion in the presence of the vegetation , but without taking the deposition of the pollutant into account @xcite . when including the deposition , authors opted both for simplified model with constant deposition velocity @xcite and complex models expressing the dependence of the deposition velocity on various parameters such as the particle size or the wind speed @xcite .",
    "dispersion of the particles with a fixed size can be described by one scalar partial differential equation .",
    "when the behaviour of the particle size distribution is of interest , straightforward approach - so called _ sectional _ approach - is to divide the size range into a number of discrete bins and then model the appropriate number of scalar pdes , i.e. one for each bin .",
    "other option is to use the transport equation for the moments of the particle size distribution .",
    "such approach can reduce the number of pdes to be solved , and therefore reduce the computational demands .",
    "this class of methods , here referred to as the _ moment method _ , has been used for the simulation of the aerosol behaviour for a long time @xcite .",
    "usage of the moment method in the air quality models is also widespread ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "adapting the deposition velocity models to the moment method framework is not straightforward , since the mathematical formulation of the moment method requires all terms in the equation to be in the form of the power law of the particle size .",
    "@xcite simplified the problem by using the resistance model with brownian particle diffusivity and settling velocity averaged over the particle size range .",
    "@xcite developed a deposition velocity model based on the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model , however , only includes the processes of brownian diffusion , impaction and gravitational settling , and does not take into account the processes of interception and turbulent impaction , which play an important role in the dry deposition process @xcite .",
    "this study aims to fix this shortcoming by adapting the model by @xcite for the use in the moment method .",
    "the developed model is then used in the microscale cfd solver to solve the problems of a pollutant dispersion in the presence of a vegetation .",
    "to the authors best knowledge , the moment method has not yet been applied to the microscale urban vegetation problems .",
    "comparison of the obtained results with the results from the sectional model shows the applicability of such approach .",
    "the governing equation for the transport and the deposition of the aerosol particles of a diameter @xmath0 in the flow field given by the velocity @xmath1 can be formulated as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number concentration of the particles @xcite .",
    "diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is expressed as a fraction of the turbulent viscosity and the turbulent schmidt number .",
    "effects of the gravitational acceleration @xmath5 are captured in the terminal settling velocity of a particle , given by the stokes equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of the particle , @xmath8 is the dynamic viscosity of air , and @xmath9 is the cunningham correction factor @xcite .",
    "the formula used for the correction factor is discussed in section [ sec : brown - dif ] .",
    "the removal of the particles via dry deposition is modelled by a product of three parameters : _ leaf area density _ ( lad ) , defined as a leaf area per unit volume ( ) , deposition velocity @xmath10 ( ) measuring the filtration efficiency of the vegetation under given conditions , and the particle concentration @xcite .",
    "its form is discussed in section [ sec : depvel ] .",
    "the moment method is based on the idea that in order to model the size distribution of the particles , we can investigate the behaviour of the moments of the distribution .",
    "moment of the distribution is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the order of the moment .",
    "some moments have straightforward physical interpretation : @xmath13 is the total number concentration , @xmath14 is proportionate to the surface area concentration and @xmath15 is proportionate to the volume concentration .    assuming @xmath3 is sufficiently smooth in space and time , moment equations are obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : n - eq ] ) by @xmath16 , integrating over the whole size range and interchanging the derivatives and the integrals : @xmath17    now we are left with the evaluation of the integrals in ( [ eq : moment - eq ] ) .",
    "this can be done easily if the multiplicative terms are in a form of a polynomial function of @xmath0 .",
    "such is the case with the gravitational term , if we take into account that gravity plays significant role only for larger particles , where the cunningham correction factor @xmath9 in ( [ eq : us ] ) can be left out . using ( [ eq : us ] ) in the third term on the rhs of ( [ eq : moment - eq ] ) , the term can be rewritten as @xmath18 here we introduced a dependence on the moment of a higher order .",
    "that necessitates that we either solve a separate moment equation also for this higher order moment , or that this moment can be calculated from the moments that we solve for .",
    "the task of integrating the deposition term is more difficult and will be examined in the following section .",
    "variety of models describing the rate of particle transport from the air to the vegetation surface has been proposed @xcite .",
    "dry deposition schemes used in the large - scale air quality models are usually formulated in terms of a friction velocity or a wind speed at some height above the canopy , and do not explicitely model the behaviour inside the canopy .",
    "as such , they are not directly applicable in the microscale cfd models , but the same principles governing the deposition still apply .    in this study we adopted the deposition velocity expression given by @xcite for needle - like obstacles .",
    "@xcite formulated the expressions for deposition velocities ( or collection velocities in the original terminology ) associated with each of the five main processes driving the dry deposition inside the canopy .",
    "the model then assumes that these processes , which are the brownian diffusion , interception , impaction , turbulent impaction , and sedimentation , are acting in parallel and independently .",
    "the deposition velocity thus can be written as a sum of the deposition velocities of all processes , @xmath19 contributions of each process to the deposition velocity for an exemplary set of parameters are shown on fig .",

    "( [ eq : moment - eq ] ) into integrals pertaining to the every physical process separately . in this section",
    ", we will describe each process in more detail and show how it can be adapted to the moment method .",
    "few simplifications were made to the original model to make the subsequent analysis simpler : we considered only plagiophile canopies and dirac distribution of the needle sizes .",
    "also note that here we focus only on needle - like obstacles . similar model for broadleaf canopies , given in @xcite , could be adapted to the moment method as well .",
    "brownian diffusion is the dominant process driving the deposition of the particles smaller then 0.1 @xcite .",
    "original model formulates the contribution to the deposition velocity due to the brownian diffusion as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnitude of the wind velocity , @xmath22 is the schmidt number ( with @xmath23 being the kinematic viscosity of air and @xmath24 the brownian diffusion coefficient , @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is the reynolds number , and @xmath27 is the needle diameter .",
    "assuming laminar boundary layer around the obstacles , the model constants hold the values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "the original model parameterizes its contribution to the deposition velocity as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ratio of the leaf surface projected on the plane perpendicular to the flow to the total leaf surface .",
    "since there is a linear dependence on the particle diameter , the expression can be integrated as is , resulting in @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "inertial impaction occurs when particles do not follow the streamlines due to their inertia , resulting in the collision with the obstacle .",

    "the higher values of the deposition velocity for particles around are the consequence of the inexact approximation to the inertial impaction term described in section [ sec : vd - im ] .",

    "both solvers were run on a single core of an intel xeon x5365 processor .    the sectional model , comprised of 41 scalar pdes , finished in 9120 seconds .",
    "the average runtime per each equation was thus 222 seconds .",
    "moment model , comprised of 3 coupled pdes , finished in 1128 seconds .",
    "that gives us eightfold acceleration compared to the sectional model .",
    "even though the high number of bins used in this study might not be necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate results , to get an equivalent workload as the moment method in this case , only 5 bins could be used in the sectional model .",
    "such number is insufficient to model the behaviour of the number distribution as well as the volume distribution well .",
    "two points can be made in favor of the sectional method though .",
    "first , the solution process of every equation is independent on the other equations , therefore the approach offers effortless parallelization for the number of cores up to the numbers of bins used .",
    "this is not especially advantageous in our implementation , as the openfoam solvers are already parallelizable , but it could be an important factor for other implementations .",
    "secondly , the relaxation factor 0.95 used for all simulations in the sectional approach was needed only for the bins representing the larger particles . using different values of this parameter for different bins can provide some reduction of the runtime .",
    "in this study , we introduced a formulation of a dry deposition model suitable for implementation in a moment method .",
    "as the original model by @xcite , our approximation includes five main processes of the dry deposition : brownian diffusion , interception , impaction , turbulent impaction , and sedimentation .",
    "the developed deposition velocity model was implemented in a microscale finite volume solver based on the openfoam platform .",
    "the solver employs the moment method to calculate the particle size distribution in the domain .",
    "the deposition model was tested on two example problems of microscale pollutant dispersion .",
    "comparison with the sectional method using the original dry deposition model revealed that the moment method is able to reproduce the shape of the particle size distribution well .",
    "the relative differences between the sectional and the moment method in terms of the third moment of the distribution were below 10 % .",
    "this difference was caused by the higher deposition velocity in our model , which in turn was caused by the inexact representation of the impaction process .",
    "the impaction term could be represented better by employing numerical integration , that would however result in a higher computational costs , and reduce the advantages of using the moment method .",
    "the moment method , described by three coupled pdes , proved to be more computationally efficient than the sectional model using 41 bins .",
    "the speedup was approximately eightfold , and a workload equivalent to the moment method would be achieved by running a sectional model that uses only 5 bins .",
    "this performance improvement together with the reliable results shows that the moment methods , often used in large scale atmospheric models , can be useful also for the microscale problems of pollutant dispersion in the urban environment .    the developed method",
    "as formulated here is applicable only when the particle size distribution can be approximated as a lognormal distribution .",
    "here we used only unimodal distribution , but the usage of multimodal distribution would be also possible by superposition of several unimodal ones . furthermore , the method could be reformulated for other distributions , provided that algebraic relations between the moments and distribution parameters are known .",
