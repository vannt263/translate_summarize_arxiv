    "over the last decades , general populations have known sharp improvements in their mortality .",
    "these movements for all ages have been largely attributed to the technical development in public health and improvements in socio - economic conditions ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this evolutionary phenomenon has impacted domains that are critical for the functioning of societies , as for instance planning for social security and health care systems and for the funding of retirement income systems , and employment and education organization for increasing older populations .",
    "hence adequate descriptions of the future mortality are needed .",
    "growing efforts to provide appropriate mortality forecasts have been known after mainly the seminal paper of lee and carter @xcite in 1992 .",
    "they introduced a stochastic approach to forecast mortality of a population using age and calendar year .",
    "their innovative proposal is still attractive and used extensively because of reasonable fits for most western countries and simplicity and ease of use in practice , for instance the lee - carter methodology is used as a benchmark methodology by the us bureau of the census .",
    "moreover , the lee and carter model has motivated to further authors the development of extensions and variants , for instance brouhns et al .",
    "@xcite , li and lee @xcite , renshaw and haberman @xcite , and hyndman and ullah@xcite .",
    "other models have been also developed to deal with the challenges that future mortality presents .",
    "surveys of techniques dealing with mortality projections are presented in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "literature shows that some of those models have been based on transforms of survival functions .",
    "this type of models consists in transforms that are applied to survival functions in such a way that their outcomes have much simpler dynamics than those of survival functions . in this way",
    ", these models may describe an important part of the mortality data variability over fitting periods as well as over forecasting periods . among well - known models of this type",
    "are the relational method based on the logit transform introduced by brass in 1974 @xcite , and , more recently , inspired by the wang transform , the model proposed by de jong and marshall in 2007 @xcite which describes shifts of z - scores . in these two models",
    "the transforms of survival functions are represented by principally time parameters .",
    "let us see closer these models based on transforms of survival functions , which are related to our new model .",
    "brass proposed the model ( see @xcite and e.g. @xcite ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a survival function at age @xmath3 and in year @xmath4 , logit@xmath5 , @xmath6 , is the logit transform of @xmath3 , @xmath7 represents the natural logarithm of @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants , and @xmath10 is a given year . on the other side ,",
    "de jong and marshall proposed a model based on z - scores given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath11 where the first part contains the standard normal distribution @xmath12 and is a linear regression model with a known regressor vector @xmath13 , @xmath9 an unknown regression parameter vector , @xmath14 a value to be defined in the second part , and @xmath15 zero mean measurement errors , and the second part models @xmath14 as a wiener process with drift @xmath16 and variance @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the wang transform @xmath19 is identified when these authors rewrite the continuous model in its discrete version and introduce their observation that the shifts of the z - scores ( obtained from the application of the inverse of the standard normal distribution to survival functions ) between successive years seem to be constant over time , which gives @xmath20 the following rewriting of the last expression is of interest for us : @xmath21 note that and are relationships among transforms of survival functions .",
    "also , the dynamics of these models in terms of time are reduced to the dynamics of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we consider in this article the application of the transform @xmath24 , @xmath25 , to survival functions for representing and forecasting mortality . to this aim",
    ", the differences of these applications of @xmath26 between any year and another given year are modeled by using time- and age - parameters .",
    "the resulting relationship is like or and thus the mortality forecasting is reduced to the forecasting of the time - parameters .",
    "hence mortality forecasting is straightforward .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the application of @xmath26 to survival functions is examined in section [ examination ] .",
    "section [ model ] presents the formulation of our new stochastic mortality model based on @xmath26 .",
    "section [ illustrations ] presents numerical illustrations of applications of the new model to sex - based mortality data of some countries .",
    "comparisons of these models with the well - known lee - carter ( lc ) and cairns - blake - dowd ( cbd ) models using in - sample and out - of - sample goodness - of - fit criteria of mortality projections are provided .",
    "additionally , assessments of the performance of these models , using rates of mortality improvement , are discussed .",
    "the last section presents conclusions and next steps of future research with the new proposed model .",
    "in this paper survival functions are intensively used .",
    "we first present some ways to obtain these functions since they are not available in life tables . to this aim",
    ", we will use the probability that an individual aged @xmath3 in year @xmath4 does not reach @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the central death rate , @xmath29 . for simplicity",
    ", we suppress the explicit dependence on @xmath4 in all notations when no possible confusion .    on the one side , for a given age @xmath30",
    ", the survival function @xmath31 associated to @xmath30 is based on the probabilities that someone aged exactly @xmath30 will survive for @xmath32 more years , then die within the following 1 year .",
    "these probabilities are classically written as @xmath33 and for ease of notation we write them as @xmath34 . in the actuarial literature , the curve of @xmath34 , @xmath3 = @xmath30 , @xmath35 ,  ,",
    "is called the _ curve of deaths_.    @xmath34 and @xmath36 are related by : @xmath37 and @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath38 it is not hard to see that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "conversely , from @xmath42 or @xmath31 one can compute @xmath36 using @xmath43 or @xmath44 , @xmath45 , recalling that @xmath46 .    on the other side , throughout this paper , we assume that the force of mortality , defined by @xmath47 , is constant within bands of age and time , but allowed to vary from one band to the next , i.e. @xmath48 this implies that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "combining these relationships gives @xmath51 , which allows the computation of survival probabilities from @xmath29 using the previous relationships between @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath31 .",
    "assumption is often used in mortality data analyses , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us see computations of survival probabilities using observed central death rates .",
    "estimates of @xmath52 and @xmath2 , taking @xmath53 , for french females for some ages and years , calculated using historical data of @xmath29 obtained from human mortality database @xcite , are presented in figure [ fig01 ] . in both panels of this figure",
    "there are sharp shifts of the curves towards the right .",
    "this is an evidence of mortality improvements over years .",
    "however , these movements do not happen always in the same way .",
    "the sequence of the curves of deaths reveals that these curves are increasingly narrower and thus their heights tend to be higher .",
    "moreover , the life span for french females shows no sign of approaching towards a fixed limit , since the last survival probability of the curve of deaths presented in figure [ fig01 ] tends to increase when time increases .",
    "all of this shows that the dynamics of @xmath52 and @xmath2 are complex and their examinations thus need strategies to appropiately dissect their operations .",
    "in this paper we will use the transform @xmath26 to represent mortality dynamics .",
    "to this aim , let us first see how this transform works when it is applied to survival functions , using the example introduced above .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] shows the results of the application of @xmath26 to the survival functions exhibited in figure [ fig01 ] .",
    "the resulting curves are quite smooth for most of ages with respect to the survival functions shown in figure [ fig01 ] , excepting for ages near @xmath30 . showing initially a concave shape , it seems , for the age period 70 - 94 , that the transformed curves become right linear when time increases .",
    "moreover , they present downward shifts between the years considered , but not in a constant way and also not holding always the same curve shapes . furthermore ,",
    "when age approaches towards the lowest or the highest studied ages then the curves are increasingly close each other .     to survival functions for french females , @xmath53 ]    next , we formulate relationships like or in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the difference of transformations of survival functions computed for years",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath55 where @xmath55 is a given year , i.e. @xmath56 . using the data introduced above , figure [ fig03 ] shows the outputs of these computations when the year of reference is 1950 .",
    "we now have only three curves since the curve corresponding to 1950 coincides with the horizontal axis and it then is not useful in our analysis .",
    "they are well - distinguished and well - separated among them with respect to those exhibited in figure [ fig02 ] , and show concave shapes increasingly more pronounced and downward shifts when time increases .",
    "these curves do not have unstable behaviors at high ages , i.e. near 94 years old .",
    "it is in advantage to model those ends of curves because the structure to describe is simple .",
    "furthermore , the transformation @xmath56 seems a promising method to study very high ages , e.g. from 90 and over , since the trend of its outcomes seems to be linear .     with respect to 1950 for french females , @xmath53 ]",
    "we aim to model curves like those presented in figure [ fig03 ] . for this purpose ,",
    "given the non - linear nature of the differences of @xmath57 , we borrow representations of mortality like those of james and segal in @xcite or cairns et al . in @xcite and use them to describe such differences .",
    "the structures of the methods of these authors are ease to implement and to interpret . in this paper",
    "we adopt the representation given by cairns et al . and allow greater flexibility to age - parameters . our model , which we called the sl model , for representing and forecasting mortality is , given @xmath30 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath55 , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 are age - specific constants and , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are stochastic processes that are assumed to be measurable at time @xmath4 . note that @xmath62 varies linearly in @xcite , but in it could vary non - linearly .",
    "to project @xmath56 , we adopt for the two - dimensional time series @xmath65 the dynamics given for the two - dimensional stochastic parameter vector from the cbd model @xcite , i.e. @xmath66 is modeled by the following two - dimensional random walk with drift : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant @xmath69 vector , @xmath70 is a deterministic @xmath71 upper triangular matrix , and @xmath72 is a two - dimensional standard normal random variable .",
    "note that from projections of @xmath56 one can easily compute any mortality variable using the relationships given in section [ examination ] , say for instance survival probabilities , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "next , vaying @xmath55 we get extensions of , i.e. @xmath55 can be considered as another parameter more in and also @xmath30 .",
    "note that , fixing @xmath73 , @xmath55 can be chosen smaller than @xmath74 . some of these features will be analyzed and exploited in the applications to be presented later .",
    "let us see numerical illustrations of @xmath56 when @xmath55 varies .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows curves like those exhibited in figure [ fig03 ] for french females but now for @xmath55 = 1951 , 1952 , 1953 , and 1954",
    ". note that if @xmath55 reaches 1955 , then the curve corresponding to @xmath75 does not have interest in the analysis .",
    "these new curves are lightly different among them , and it seems that all of them move upward when @xmath55 increases .",
    "the corresponding curves of figure [ fig04 ] for french males are presented in figure [ fig05 ] .",
    "they are a bit different from the french female curves .",
    "now the lower curves hold concave shapes , but the upper curves are not always concave and present convex pieces .      the model , given @xmath55 and @xmath30 , is fitted to computed values of @xmath56 using ordinary least squares ( ols ) .",
    "it consists in to minimize @xmath76 as noticed by brouhns et al .",
    "@xcite , models like are not simple regression models since there are no observed covariates in the right - hand side . hence alternative ways to find values of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath62 minimizing are required .",
    "we notice that the uni - dimensional or elementary newton method proposed by goodman @xcite can be used in this case .",
    "this method works like the iterative newton method but considering in each iteration one parameter at a time . in this way each parameter is updated in the iteration @xmath77 before the iteration of the next parameter in the same iteration @xmath77 .",
    "iteration moves from @xmath77 to @xmath78 when all the parameters have iterated in the iteration @xmath77 .",
    "this process continues until to find the convergence of the sequence of parameter estimates or another stopping condition .",
    "the fitting of to data showed that some parameters may require slow convergences .",
    "it was implemented by reducing the variations among iterations , for instance multiplying such variations by a factor @xmath79 .",
    "this is taken into account in the following iteration algorithm designed to minimize :    1 .",
    "initializations : 1 .",
    "initialization of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath62 : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . + a strategy to obtain these initial values is to fix @xmath62 using a known function of @xmath3 .",
    "then one can find estimates @xmath83 and @xmath84 applying linear regressions of @xmath85 on @xmath62 for each @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   set the maximal number of iterations @xmath86 .",

    "we examine this mortality variable since it is commonly used in practice , for instance to build mortality tables and to compute annuities .",
    "we focus on mortality at higher ages because it is related to population ageing",
    ". age periods from @xmath118 to @xmath59 are analyzed taking @xmath118 = 60 , 65 and @xmath59 = 89 , 94 .    observed mortality from 1960 to 2009",
    "is used to evaluate in - sample and out - of - sample mortality projection accuracies .",
    "this year period is divided in two , the first , from @xmath73 = 1960 to @xmath119 = 1989 , to fit the models to data and the second , from 1990 to 2009 , to forecast mortality . for the ls model",
    "we fix @xmath120 in .",
    "we examine both in - sample and out - of - sample projection accuracies of @xmath28 employing a couple of goodness - of - fit criteria often used to evaluate projection performance ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the first criterion is the mean squared error ( mse ) defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the observed and estimated values of mortality in fitting or forecasting samples , and the second criterion is the mean absolute percentage error ( mape ) defined as @xmath124 a smaller mse or mape value indicates a better fit to the data on a given period .",
    "however , the lowest values of these indexes are not associated to the same model necessarily .",
    "we will come back on this issue later .    for each combination of the values of @xmath118 and @xmath59 mentioned above",

    "values of mse and mape are shown for fitting and forecasting year periods , nested in each category of sex .",
    "additionally , in each combination of country and sex and fitting / forecasting year period , the lowest values of mse and mape among the models studied are highlighted , which allow the identification of the models with the best fits . besides",
    ", the values of mse are displayed with two decimals and those of mape with one decimal , this may produce some confusion if a highlighted value equals other values , but there is no conflict since such selection was done using more decimals than those displayed .",
    "a general finding through all these tables is that , as expected , the values of mse or mape on forecasting periods are always much higher than their corresponding values on fitting periods .",
    "also , as indicated above , for fitting as well as for forecasting periods , not always the model with the highest value of mse is the model with the highest value of mape .",
    "additionally , the distributions of the highlighted models are frequently different from a table to another , but in a few cases , for a pair of tables and a given country , one can find the same selection of models .",
    "another finding is that the values of mse or mape , over fitting or forecasting periods , are in general higher for males than for females , which suggests that the modelization of mortality is more difficult for males than for females .    on the fitting period , for females",
    ", the highlighted values are concentrated mainly on the lc model and a few cases on the ls model , and none of these values is associated to the cbd model .",
    "an interesting feature of the lc model is that it is highlighted almost everywhere when @xmath59 is 94 . regarding males ,",
    "the highlighted models are concentrated mainly on the cbd and lc models and a few cases on the ls model .",
    "moreover , no model is predominant through all values of @xmath118 and @xmath59 .    on the forecasting period ,",
    "a first observation is that not always the best model over the fitting period corresponds to the best model over the forecasting period .",
    "this implies that the distribution of the highlighted values varies between these two periods . on females",
    ", we have a sharp presence of the sl model , excepting the case @xmath118 = 60 and @xmath59 = 94 .",
    "it performs better than the benchmark models for us and uk , and gives the best mortality projection accuracies for jp and sw when @xmath118 = 65 and @xmath59 is 89 or 94 .",
    "highlighted values associated to the lc and cdb models appear in a few times .",
    "on males , there is a strong presence of the cbd model for an important number of countries through all values of @xmath118 and @xmath59 , mainly be , ne , sw , and us .",
