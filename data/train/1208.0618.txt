    "an important result known as the recurrence theorem @xcite establishes that quantum as well as classical systems will come very close to their initial state at some time during their evolution . this time is known as the recurrence time , and the theorem applies in the context of closed systems .",
    "this kind of recurrence behavior has been observed experimentally in quantum systems such as rydberg states of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "a straightforward consequence of the theorem is that closed systems possess , at least in a broad sense , an intrinsic or natural frequency given by the inverse of the recurrence time .",
    "the intrinsic frequency characterizes the response of the system to external driving .",
    "the amplitude of the response is maximally enhanced when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency of the system  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement underlies a number of important physical phenomena and its understanding is of fundamental interest . assuming that the driving frequency is constant",
    ", one should minimize fluctuations of the natural frequency in order to amplify the response , especially when the parameters of the system are subject to small perturbations .",
    "certain classical aspects of stability in two - body systems have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "likewise , the stability of quantum dynamics as a result of a small change in the parameters has been discussed in several works , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite or ref .",
    "@xcite . in models with classical counterparts ,",
    "the inner product between quantum states of two systems with the same initial condition but with slightly different parameters remains close to unity during the evolution as long as the initial wave function is well localized inside a stable island of the classical map .",
    "the opposite takes place when the initial condition is localized in a chaotic region .",
    "additionally , recurrences in bosonic systems have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as a form of state transfer in the time domain .",
    "our proposal is different in that we study hamiltonians displaying two - body interaction .",
    "here we intend to approach the issue of stability by studying the behavior of periodicity in a quantum model .",
    "the study contains a moderate analysis of the period , which lays the foundation for the subsequent argument concerning stability . in the absence of a classical analogue , we base our approach exclusively on the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian , making little reference to the initial state .    in this paper",
    "we focus initially on a series of issues related to the recurrence period of a two - boson system , particularly , the question of how small the period can be as a function of the parameters .",
    "similarly , we find the set of parameters and the directions along which such parameters must be tuned in order to keep the period constant . finally , we suggest an application to a quantum optical technique known as coherent population trapping .",
    "the results we obtain are also relevant in other scenarios .",
    "for instance , in quantum computation , where some information protocols  @xcite or quantum gates are subject to perturbations of the parameters . additionally , this study gives insight into the physics of few - boson systems  @xcite , which constitute the basis of more complex structures .    in the language of second - quantization",
    ", the quantum state is written with reference to occupation modes of unperturbed levels . in this context , let us focus on a model featuring two - body interaction , such as @xmath0    as usual , the exchange term @xmath1 and the unperturbed energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 define the single - body response , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 determine the intensity of the interaction among particles and can be seen as a nonlinear contribution .",
    "the mode operators satisfy the usual bosonic relations @xmath6=[\\hat{a}_2,\\hat{a}_2^{\\dagger}]=1 $ ] , etc .",
    "the unperturbed system can be probed by looking at the absorption profile of an incident laser of frequency @xmath7    is a conserved quantity .",
    "the proposed system reduces to a two - level model when @xmath8 .",

    "the state evolution is given by the expression ( in what follows , we set @xmath15 ) @xmath16    hence , periodicity arises whenever @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the period of the recurrence , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are integer numbers . in this case",
    "the periodicity is absolute as the quantum state recurs identically at regular intervals and the corresponding evolution operator equals the unity operator .",
    "another form of periodicity @xcite emerges by considering instances in which the quantum state recurs up to a phase , i.e. @xmath22    we call this partial periodicity , since the phase factor may generate quantum interference effects . as an example , let us look at hamiltonian ( [ g1_3 ] ) for a single particle @xmath23    absolute periodicity occurs whenever the ratio of energies is a fractional number @xmath24    @xmath18 can be found from eq .",

    "conversely , the minimum value is @xmath30 and takes place at @xmath31 .    in a similar way ,",
    "partial periodicity derives from    @xmath32    and therefore    @xmath33    the first equality is consistent with the view that the natural frequency of the system is proportional to the difference of its two eigenenergies . unlike @xmath18 , @xmath34 reaches a maximum @xmath35 at @xmath31 and goes down asymptotically to zero as @xmath36 , two limits in which one of the eigenenergies dominates the spectrum and the hamiltonian is almost singular .",
    "this shows that @xmath34 is maximum when @xmath18 is minimum and that @xmath34 goes to zero as @xmath18 goes to infinity .",
    "two - level systems always display partial periodicity , but not necessarily absolute periodicity .",
    "let us now probe these periodicity concepts in a larger system . for @xmath10 ,",

    "absolute periodicity results when the energy ratios adhere to the forms @xmath49    one may ask whether , given a set of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the system would display periodicity .",

    "this is also true for any reasonable quantum closed system .",
    "instead , we propose an approach in which , given a pair of ratios , we ask if a set of parameters yielding those ratios exits .",
    "following this idea we proceed as follows .",
    "let us then consider @xmath50 and @xmath51 as known variables .",
    "we divide eq .",
    "( [ g1_9 ] ) by @xmath44 and find @xmath50 .",

    "+ _ case d_. @xmath69 .",
    "+ the spectrum of the hamiltonian is threefold degenerate .",
    "hence the eigenvalue equation is of the form @xmath76 . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ g1_6 ] ) we infer that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath79 , which has no real solutions , and therefore no real - valued @xmath11 and @xmath12 yield a fully degenerate spectrum .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a map classifying the coordinate space according to the number of valid solutions encountered for every pair of ratios @xmath80 .",
    "the maximum number of solutions is 4 , usually coming from 2 real solutions of eq .",
    "( [ g1_16 ] ) . along the negative side of the axes the hamiltonian becomes reducible with @xmath81 ; hence only two solutions are possible . the two instances with one solution correspond to @xmath82 .",
    "the condition for absolute periodicity is given in eq .",
    "( [ g2_3 ] ) while partial periodicity can be determined from @xmath83 in such a way that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are both integers .",
    "if @xmath86 , with @xmath87 an integer , we can infer from eqs .",
    "( [ g2_4 ] )  and ( [ g3_1 ] ) that @xmath88    in order to find @xmath18 and @xmath34 , we first determine @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 from the rationals @xmath50 and @xmath51 in such a way that there is no common divisor greater than @xmath89 among the three generating integers . simultaneously , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are used to find the corresponding eigenenergies following the previously discussed method .",
    "we can then choose any of the identities in eqs .",
    "( [ g2_4 ] ) ( in particular we choose @xmath90 ) to get @xmath18 using one of the eigenenergies . finally , the integer @xmath87 results as the greatest common divider of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "as it can be seen , large integers @xmath21 are more likely to yield large @xmath18 and @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents sample plots of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "a complete depiction would be quite more intricate .",
    "we point out that @xmath18 decreases as @xmath50 and @xmath51 approach zero .",
    "this behavior appears to be generic , laying minimum values of @xmath18 around ( or in ) the origins .",
    "following @xmath18 across the line @xmath93 for @xmath94 , we find that it goes down asymptotically toward @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",

    "both instances suggest a relation between the minimum @xmath18 and the hamiltonian matrix being or becoming singular .",
    "[ fig3 ] depicts the intricate relation between @xmath34 and @xmath50 obtained by testing energy ratios over the @xmath98 square of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , as explained in appendix b. cooperative systems may display longer partial periods than non - interacting systems ; therefore , periodicity can help identify interacting phases .",
    "this behavior is most likely due to the capacity of many - body systems to develop complex dynamics on account of the increased number of effective states . also of interest",
    "is the chaotic aspect of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , indicating that small intervals in @xmath98 space do not necessarily map onto small intervals in @xmath34 space .",
    "this lack of continuity , which also characterizes @xmath18 , occurs because neighboring values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not always correspond to neighboring values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , @xmath99 is not far from @xmath100 , but the sets of integers that generate each pair are widely different .",
    "recall that the period depends directly on the integers .",
    "in addition , there can be common dividers between @xmath91 and @xmath92 and this might further affect the continuity of @xmath34 . finally , it can be seen from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that , when @xmath34 becomes small , at least one of the ratios @xmath50 or @xmath51 approaches zero , once again suggesting that in a hamiltonian displaying small periodicity one of the eigenenergies is much smaller than the others .",
    "as introduced here , periodicity , either total or partial , is a characteristic of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this encourages us to ask whether one can change the hamiltonian parameters without affecting the period .",
    "this happens for one particle when @xmath31 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ g2_9 ] ) :    @xmath101    for two particles , we can start out by arguing that the period is stable whenever both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are stable under changes of the parameters .",
    "moreover , we can consider the energy ratios as functions of the parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , in such a way that maximum variations occur in the direction of the function gradients and zero variations take place in the directions perpendicular to the gradients . in this way",
    ", for any set of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 one can always identify a direction of change of the parameters along which _",
    "one _ of the ratios is stable .",
    "it then follows that in order for @xmath18 to be stable the directions of zero change of both ratios must coincide , i.e. , the gradients must be parallel : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and similarly for @xmath106 . the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 are unitary vectors in parameter space and @xmath109 is a real number .",
    "this problem is equivalent to finding the extreme values of @xmath102 subject to the condition @xmath103=constant , or the other way around . in this context",
    "@xmath109 takes the role of a lagrange multiplier and the analogy applies as long as the involved functions are smooth .",
    "the extremes of @xmath50 can be worked out from fig .",
    "it is found , however , that not all extreme values imply parallel gradients .",
    "for instance , along the edges , where @xmath50 or @xmath51 is @xmath110 , the identification of borders on each side of the axis generates a discontinuity in the first derivative of the ratios and the analogy with the lagrange method does not apply .",
    "likewise , for the extremes located around the neighborhood of the axes at least one of the parameters diverge toward infinity and there is no solution of eq .",
    "( [ g1_16 ] ) along the positive side of the axes . in general",
    ", we find the gradients to be parallel only along the blue ( continuous ) lines of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] located between green and red regions .    figure  [ fig6 ] shows curves indicating the parameters as well as the directions of change corresponding to zero variation of the period .",
    "far from the origin the curves approach ( but do not seem to touch ) straight lines given by simple expressions .",
    "in one case the direction of zero change aligns with the direction of the curve as we get away from the origin . in the other case",
    "the direction of zero change becomes constant with an angle of inclination @xmath111 satisfying @xmath112 .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , when the parameters are shifted in the direction of zero change the dynamics of corresponding systems look similar .",
    "conversely , when the change of parameters occurs in the direction of the gradient , the dynamics soon diverge .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our study and shows that in certain cases the period alone characterizes the global profile of the system evolution .      besides applicable to systems described by the hamiltonian  ( [ g1_1 ] )",
    ", our results can be extrapolated to models with analogous hamiltonians .",
    "let us consider a three - level quantum system interacting with two lasers .",
