    "the quasinormal modes analysis is a paradigm for the study of gravitational excitations of black holes . for a comprehensive review on the vast previous literature ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we stress that the quasinormal modes ( qnm ) of black holes are also experimentally relevant since they could , in principle , be detected in gravitational waves detector such as lisa ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the robustness of qnm analysis has been established by considering several kinds of generalizations , as , for instance , relaxing the asymptotic flatness condition@xcite or considering time - dependent situations@xcite .",
    "the case of asymptotic anti - de - sitter black holes has deserved special attention due to its relevance to the ads / cft conjecture@xcite .",
    "the analysis of qnm for time - dependent situations is of special physical interest since it is expect that a black hole can enlarge its mass by some accretion process , or even lose mass by some other process , including hawking radiation .",
    "the late time tail for a klein gordon field under a time - dependent potential was first considered in @xcite , where some influence of the temporal dependence of the potential over the characteristic decaying tails was reported .",
    "such a kind of time - dependent potential arises naturally when the vaidya metric is considered@xcite .",
    "the vaidya metric , which in radiation coordinates @xmath0 has the form [ vaidya ] ds^2 = -(1-)dw^2 + 2cdrdw + r^2d^2 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is a solution of einstein s equations with spherical symmetry in the eikonal approximation to a radial flow of unpolarized radiation . for the case of an ingoing radial flow , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a monotone increasing mass function in the advanced time @xmath5 , while @xmath6 corresponds to an outgoing radial flow , with @xmath4 being in this case a monotone decreasing mass function in the retarded time @xmath5 .",
    "the metric ( [ vaidya ] ) is the starting point for the qnm analysis of varying mass black - holes .    in @xcite ,",
    "massless scalar fields were studied on an electrically charged version of the vaidya metric .",
    "basically , two kinds of continuously varying mass functions were considered : @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , called , respectively , linear and exponential models .",
    "generalized tortoise coordinates were introduced , and a standard numerical analysis was done .",
    "the conclusion was that , as a first approximation , the qnm for a stationary reissner - nordstrm black hole with mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath10 are still valid , as if some stationary adiabatic regime was indeed governing the qnm dynamics for time - dependent spacetimes . in principle",
    ", one should not expect such stationary behavior for very rapid varying mass functions , however the analysis of @xcite was not able to identify any breaking of such an adiabatic regime .",
    "we notice also that both linear and exponential models , inspired by some known exact solutions@xcite for which generalized tortoise coordinates could be explicitly constructed , would hardly correspond to physically realistic cases .",
    "both cases have @xmath11-class mass functions , implying the existence of some infinitesimal shell distributions of matters for @xmath12 and @xmath13 whose interpretation and role are still unclear .",
    "we attack here the qnm problem by considering the vaidya metric in double - null coordinates@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of such an approach is the possibility of considering any ( monotone ) mass function , allowing , for instance , the analysis of smooth mass functions that could correspond to physically more relevant situations , free of obscure infinitesimal matter shells .",
    "furthermore , the use of double - null coordinates has improved considerably the overall precision of the numerical analysis , allowing us to identify the breakdown of the adiabatic regime , characterized by the appearing of a non - stationary inertial effect for the qnm in the case of rapid varying mass functions .",
    "once the stationary regime is reached , the standard qnm results hold , reinforcing , once more , the robustness of the qnm analysis .",
    "our results can be used as a first approximation to describe the propagation of small perturbations around astrophysically realistic situations where black holes undergo some mass accretion processes .",
    "we notice that the non - stationary inertial effect presented here is in perfect agreement with the non - linear analysis preformed in @xcite , which reported extra redshift effects on the qnm frequencies due to the growth of the effective black hole mass .",
    "we organize this paper as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to a brief introduction to the semi - analytical approach@xcite for the vaidya metric in double - null coordinates .",
    "section iii presents the main issues and results of our numerical analysis .",
    "the last section is left to some closing remarks .",
    "double - null coordinates are specially suitable for time - evolution problems as the qnm analysis",
    ". however , the difficulties of constructing double - null coordinates for non - stationary spacetime are well known .",
    "the vaidya metric is a typical example ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , it is known that the problem of constructing double - null coordinates for generic mass functions is not analytical soluble in general@xcite .",
    "the semi - analytical approach proposed in @xcite is the starting point for our analysis here .",
    "it consists , basically , in considering the vaidya metric in double - null coordinates _ ab initio _ , avoiding the need of constructing any coordinate transformation .",
    "the spherically symmetric line element in double - null coordinates is [ uv ] ds^2 = -2f(u , v)dudv + r^2(u , v)d^2 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are smooth non vanishing functions .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a unidirectional radial flow of unpolarized radiation in the eikonal approximation is given by [ t ] t_ab = h(u , v)k_a k_b , where @xmath16 is a radial null vector . the einstein s equations for the case of a flow in the @xmath17-direction can then be reduced to the following set of equations@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are arbitrary functions obeying , according to the weak energy condition , [ we ] b(v)m(v ) 0 , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the solution of ( [ ef])-([eh ] ) will correspond to the vaidya metric in double - null coordinates , as one can interpret from ( [ uv ] ) and ( [ t ] ) . for @xmath21 , the choice b=-(m )",
    "allows one to interpret @xmath20 as the mass of the solution and @xmath17 as the proper time as measured in the rest frame at infinity for the asymptotically flat case@xcite .",
    "note that if the weak energy condition ( [ we ] ) holds , the function @xmath20 is monotone , implying that the radial flow must be ingoing or outgoing for all @xmath17 .",
    "it is not possible , for instance , to have `` oscillating '' mass functions @xmath20 .",
    "the semi - analytical approach of @xcite consists in a strategy to construct numerically the functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath22 from the eq .",
    "( [ ef])-([eh ] ) , and to infer the underlying causal structure .",
    "( [ er ] ) along @xmath23 constant is a first order ordinary differential equation in @xmath17 .",
    "one can evaluate the function @xmath15 in any point by solving the @xmath17-initial value problem knowing @xmath24 .",
    "the trivial example of minkowski spacetime ( @xmath25 ) , for instance , can be obtained@xcite by choosing @xmath26 .",
    "once we have @xmath15 , we can evaluate @xmath14 and @xmath22 from ( [ ef ] ) and ( [ eh ] ) .",
    "further details of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider here the following smooth mass function @xmath27 \\label{hyperbolic}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are also constant parameters .",
    "for sake of comparison with the results of @xcite , we also consider a linear model .",
    "1 depicts the causal structure corresponding to the hyperbolic mass    function ( [ hyperbolic ] ) obtained from the semi - analytical approach . for positive @xmath28 and @xmath30 ,",
    "for instance , it represents a black hole with mass @xmath31 receiving a radial flux of radiation and , consequently , enlarging continuously its mass until reaching @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of the initial condition for solving ( [ er ] ) is a rather subtle issue@xcite . for our purposes here , we note only that demanding @xmath33 is sufficient to guarantee that , for any @xmath20 , the underlying spacetime causal structure does not depend on the initial condition @xmath24 . for constant @xmath34 and @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) can be easily integrated , leading to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary function of @xmath23 .",
    "it is also possible to solve eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) analytically for the linear and exponential mass functions@xcite .",
    "( [ ic ] ) is our reference to choose the initial conditions @xmath24 .",
    "in the coordinate system ( [ uv ] ) , for any desired form of the mass function @xmath20 , the equations for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations can be easily put in the form@xcite @xmath38 where the potential @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond , respectively , to the scalar and to the electromagnetic cases . for a given mass function @xmath20 ,",
    "one first evaluates the function @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the semi - analytical approach of the previous section , and then the characteristic problem corresponding to ( [ scalar ] ) can be solved with the usual second order characteristic algorithm@xcite , where the initial data are specified along the two null surfaces @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "since the basic aspects of the field decay are independent of the initial conditions ( this fact is confirmed by our simulations ) , we use the gaussian initial condition @xmath45 \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath46 .",
    "our typical numerical grid is large enough to assure that we can set effectively this last constant to zero .",
    "after the integration is completed , the values @xmath47 are extracted , where @xmath48 is the maximum value of @xmath23 on the numerical grid .",
    "taking sufficiently large @xmath48 , we have good    approximations for the wave function at the event horizon .",
    "figure 2 presents an example of @xmath47 data for a hyperbolic increasing mass function and its comparison with the case of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "similar results hold if we extract the data for other values of @xmath23 .",
    "all the analysis presented here corresponds to the data extracted on the horizon @xmath48 .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath48 is a matter of numerical convenience . since the qnm corresponds to eigenstates of an effective schroedinger equation@xcite ,",
    "the associated complex eigenvalues can be read out anywhere once the asymptotic regime is attained .    from the function @xmath47",
    ", one can infer the characteristic frequencies @xmath49 of the damped oscillating modes .",
    "since the frequencies @xmath49 are themselves time - dependent ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , for a given @xmath17 , @xmath50 is determined locally by a non - linear @xmath51-fitting by using some damped cycles of @xmath52 around @xmath17 .",
    "we perform an exhaustive numerical analysis for many different mass functions @xmath20 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 present the real ( @xmath53 ) and imaginary ( @xmath54 ) part of the frequencies of the perturbations as function of @xmath17 .",
    "they correspond , respectively , to some decreasing and increasing mass functions , and are typical for all values of @xmath55 , all kinds of perturbations ( scalar and electromagnetic ) and different initial conditions .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath54 exhibits similar time - dependence , although its values are typically known with lower precision than @xmath53 .",
    "this is not , however , due to numerical errors in the integration procedure .",
    "in fact , the convergence of the second order characteristic algorithm is quite good .",
    "for instance , the differences in the calculated frequencies of fig . 3 and 4 obtained by using as integration steps @xmath56 and 0.05 , are smaller than the size of the points used in the figures , and no difference is detected for even smaller steps .",
    "we credit the irregularities observed for @xmath54 to the local @xmath51-fitting described above . for",
    "subcritical damped oscillations as the qnm considered here , the oscillation frequencies @xmath53 can be easily determined from a few damped cycles , while for the damping term @xmath54 one typically needs many more cycles in order to get a similar precision . by taking a large number of cycles",
    "we will tend to smear the calculated frequencies , leading to some kind of average and not to the desired instantaneous values .",
    "we opt , then , to take as few as possible cycles , paying the price of having some irregularities for @xmath54 .",
    "let us take for a close analysis , for instance , the case of decreasing @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for the rapid varying cases ( linear 2 and hyperbolic 2 ) ,",
    "one clearly sees the inertial effect for @xmath53 near @xmath57 .",
    "the function @xmath58 does not follow the track corresponding to @xmath59 , as one would expect for a stationary adiabatic regime , and as it really does for the hyperbolic 1 case .",
    "after the rapid increasing phase , @xmath53 acts as it would have some intrinsic inertia , reaching a maximum value that is bigger than @xmath60 , implying the relaxation corresponding to the region with @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "we also notice that , for the rapid varying case , one could not detect sensible differences between the smooth hyperbolic case and the @xmath11 linear one .",
    "nevertheless , one can see that the slower linear case ( linear 1 ) exhibits some inertial effects close the the second matching point of @xmath20 . in all other regions ,",
    "it follows the track corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "no appreciable difference in the transients of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations was detected .",
    "as we have already mentioned , such transient inertial behavior passed unnoticed by the qnm analysis in radiation coordinates performed in .",
    "analogous conclusions hold for the case of increasing @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    in fact , since the increasing mass functions considered here can be obtained from the decreasing ones by a time - reversal @xmath63 , the underlying causal structures are equivalent@xcite , and the corresponding qnm are also related . under a time - reversal , the graph of @xmath53 ( and of @xmath54 ) must be reflected on a horizontal axis .",
    "we could infer from our numerical simulations the situation corresponding to the onset of the qnm non - stationary inertial behavior .",
    "the deviation from the stationary regime is measured by the second derivative of the mass function @xmath64 .",
    "heuristically , one should expect the appearing of non - stationary behavior when @xmath65 is smaller than a certain characteristic time of the system , what should prevent the system to relax into an adiabatic regime .",
    "there are two characteristic times associated to the qnm of black holes : the oscillation period @xmath66 and the damping time @xmath67 .",
    "the onset of the inertial behavior is associated to the second one .",
    "we verify appreciable deviations from the stationary regime whenever @xmath68 is of the same order ( or larger ) than @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , for hyperbolic 2 and hyperbolic 4 data set ( corresponding to the inertial behavior depicted in figs .",
    "3 and 4 ) we have @xmath70 , while for hyperbolic 1 and hyperbolic 3 ( the stationary behavior ) such ratio is 100 times smaller .",
    "estimating the magnitude of the inertial effect from our numerical simulations without an approximated analytical model seems to be much harder .",
    "again heuristically , one expects that the magnitude of the effect be proportional to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the time interval along which @xmath73 .",
    "we could check that the relative variations in frequencies during the inertial behavior for the smooth case are always limited by the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "further analytical work is certainly necessary to enlighten this point .",
    "we finish by noticing that for the @xmath11 linear case , @xmath75 is always large , increasing indeed with @xmath76 , and hence non - stationary inertial behavior is reported in all simulations using @xmath11 linear data set . since @xmath72 is very small in such cases ( of the same order of @xmath77 ) , the magnitude of the inertial effects are also typically small .",
    "all situations we considered in the present work involve mass functions corresponding to an initial black hole with mass @xmath31 undergoing some accretion / losing mass process and ending with a mass @xmath32 .",
    "such an `` asymptotic schwarzschild '' choice assures us that the spacetime has the usual black hole causal structure for @xmath78 and , consequently , that qnm can be defined in the usual way and that the corresponding frequencies can be properly compared . for all the cases considered , the inertial transients dissipate away and @xmath50 tends to follow the track of @xmath59 rather quickly , rendering the robustness of the numerical qnm analysis .",
    "the integration in double - null coordinates has turned out to be much more efficient than the integration in radiation coordinates@xcite , allowing us to reach the precision necessary to unveil the reported non - stationary behavior with quite modest computational resources . despite the radiation coordinates",
    "are known to be defective at the horizon@xcite , we believe that numerical analysis as those one presented in @xcite are still confident since the qnm analysis is always concerned to the exterior region of the black hole . however , as confirmed by the present calculations , algorithms based on the characteristic integration are typically by far more efficient .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would be analysis of the highly damped qnm ( overtones , @xmath79 ) . since for such overtones",
    "the ratio @xmath80 is always larger than for the @xmath81 qnm considered here , including , for sufficient large @xmath82 , cases for which @xmath83 , it would be interesting to check if the non - stationary inertial behavior could somehow be attenuated for @xmath79 .",
    "we notice that the numerical analysis presented here can not be extended directly to the @xmath79 case since one can not identify the @xmath79 frequencies with sufficient accuracy .",
    "we believe this could be attained , in principle , by means of the wkb approximation .",
    "although the typical astrophysical situations of mass accretion for black holes will hardly keep spherical symmetry intact during intermediate stages , our results can be used as a first approximation for the scattering by this sources since , as it is well known , after the transient phases , the system should accommodate itself in a stationary spherical symmetric configuration .",
    "one must , however , keep in mind that non - stationary inertial behavior in the qnm frequencies is expected to take place whenever @xmath73 , rendering the analysis of the rapid variating situations a subtler task .",
    "the evaporation by hawking radiation could indeed be considered as a physically genuine process where the black hole mass decreases and spherical symmetry is maintained .",
    "our approach can be applied for this case , with some crucial remarks about the causal structure of the spacetime left behind after the evaporation@xcite .",
    "we finish by noticing , as it is well known , that the damped oscillations correspond to an intermediate phase in the wave scattering by asymptotic flat black holes .",
    "the very last final phase corresponds , indeed , to a power law decay . in the problems considered here",
    ", the power law tail typically appears for large values of @xmath17 for which the qnm already settled down in the stationary phase , with no trace from the transients .",
    "we do not detect , in this case , any influence of the time - dependence of the potential in these tails .",
    "there is no contradiction with the results reported in @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of our choice of `` asymptotic schwarzschild '' mass functions , for which the corresponding potential has no resemblance with those ones considered in @xcite .",
