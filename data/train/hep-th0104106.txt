    "noncommutative spacetimes have been studied intensively over the last few years @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the fact that they occur as low energy limit of string theory when a constant @xmath1 background is turned on makes the subject even more interesting @xcite .",
    "a perturbative study of @xmath0 field theory revealed an intriguing transmutation of some uv divergences into ir divergences @xcite .",
    "this is very reminiscent of what happens in string perturbation theory where the world sheet duality or modular invariance maps the uv region into the ir region .",
    "this is the origin of the well known fact that there are no uv divergences in string theory .    in the light of the above",
    "remarks it is natural to wonder about perturbative renormalizability of the noncommutative @xmath0 theory .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the uv divergences that continue to arise in the theory are from planar graphs @xcite and are exactly of the same form as in the commutative theory and hence can be renormalized away .",
    "the uv divergences from the non - planar graphs are , on the face of it , more severe .",
    "however they turn into ir divergences in an intriguing way and are uv finite .",
    "the non - planar graphs therefore do not threaten the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "various other aspects of noncommutative field theories have been studied in [ 6 - 34 ] .",
    "issues concerning the renormalizability of theories with global o(n ) symmetry , in the large n limit have been addressed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one can also study these issues in theories with global o(2 ) symmetry , in their broken / unbroken phases .",
    "in commutative theories if the theory is renormalizable in the unbroken phase it is trivially renormalizable in the broken phase .",
    "the ward identities guarantee this as also the masslessness of the goldstone bosons , to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "however it was found in @xcite that in the noncommutative o(2 ) theory there seems to be a violation of these identities at the one loop level .",
    "the crucial point being that the counterterm that renormalized the @xmath2-tadpole divergence could not remove the divergences in the @xmath3-@xmath3 two point function .",
    "it was also found @xcite,@xcite that for a particular choice of ordering of fields in the @xmath0 couplings , the theory is renormalizable .",
    "given that both the path integral measure and the action of the noncommutative theory have global o(2 ) symmetry one would expect this symmetry to hold at one loop ( in fact to all orders ) .",
    "we investigate this in this paper .",
    "we show that the apparent violation of the ward identities can be traced to the dropping of surface terms in the effective action . these are uv divergent surface terms .",
    "if one modifies the prescription to keep these terms , the broken theory is renormalizable .",
    "the crucial point is to keep an infrared regulator while the continuum limit ( @xmath4 ) is taken for all the processes in the theory .",
    "this prescription allows one to maintain o(2 ) symmetry in the uv divergent terms",
    ". however the infrared divergences make it difficult to use the ward identities for the two point function in the limit @xmath5 ( which is required to establish the masslessness of the pion ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the basic problem in the context of an o(2 ) model and point out the reason for it and suggest a resolution . in section iii as a preliminary step",
    "we calculate one loop graphs in the symmetric phase and discuss the ward identity . in section",
    "iv as a next step we expand one of the fields about a background value , but only in external legs i.e. masses are kept at the symmetric ( tachyonic ) value .",
    "we show that one can preserve the ward identity if we set the momentum of the background to zero only at the end of the loop calculations . in section",
    "v we consider the broken phase of the theory where the masses in the loop are the physical ( tree - level ) masses and describe a prescription that allows the ward identities to be maintained ( at one loop ) .",
    "we give our conclusions in section vi .",
    "in this section we derive the relevant ward identities for the symmetric as well as for the broken phases and show in the following sections that the ward identities hold for one loop calculations .",

    "this is goldstone s theorem .",
    "there are infrared divergences in the theory of the form @xmath26 in @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "naively this implies that the symmetric phase vacuum with @xmath29 is always a lower energy solution and therefore at one loop one has symmetry restoration .",
    "we are not sure if this is the right interpretation .",
    "a resolution of this requires a proper treatment of the ir divergences .",
    "we do not have any suggestions for this in this paper .",
    "we consider the noncommutative o(2 ) model with the only interaction term @xmath30 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an introduction to noncommutative field theories . as pointed out ,",
    "if the symmetries of the classical theory are respected by the quantum theory , all uv divergent terms must be o(n ) invariant if the uv regulator is chosen so that it respects this symmetry .",
    "we show that to one loop the symmetry is preserved i.e. the counterterms required to absorb the ultra violet divergences are o(2 ) symmetric .",
    "the terms containing @xmath31 in the integrals , with @xmath32 as the loop momentum being integrated over , are regulated .",
    "we shall call such terms as non - planar(np ) terms .",
    "such terms have @xmath33 dependence of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath33 is the uv cut off . as suggested in @xcite we shall treat these terms as potentially ir divergent terms when @xmath5 .",
    "the ward identity , equation ( 11 ) shows that the @xmath2 and the @xmath3-@xmath3 amplitudes are identical in the broken theory .",
    "the planar and the non - planar terms must be equal separately for both the amplitudes",
    ". however it was shown @xcite that the planar and the non - planar terms do not match in the broken theory thus raising the question of renormalizability of the theory .",
    "in fact naively the @xmath2 tadpole amplitude does not have any non - planar term at all .",
    "we now take another look at the problem .",
    "let us expand the non - planar terms , which contain the factor @xmath35    @xmath36 = ln\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^2pop + .... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that an infinite number of increasingly uv divergent terms are summed to give an uv finite term .",
    "what is more , when multiplying a field , as in one of the terms of    @xmath37    these are all surface terms . where @xmath38 in @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath39 .",
    "the violation of the ward identity , ( 11 ) is thus due to the dropping of these surface terms .",
    "the @xmath2 amplitude thus can be modified and made equal to the @xmath3-@xmath3 amplitude if we retain these terms .",
    "we now outline a simple prescription that takes care of all these surface terms .",
    "we break the o(2 ) symmetry by shifting one of the fields by an amount @xmath24 that is not a constant .",
    "thus the ward identity ( 11 ) becomes , @xmath40    we shall treat @xmath24 as a background classical field and restrict it to a constant only after all loop computations . with this",
    "we would be taking all infrared limits of the theory at the same time .",
    "this is a form of infrared regularization .",
    "thus we keep an infrared regulator while the continuum limit @xmath41 is taken .",
    "it ensures that the ward identities corresponding to the o(2 ) symmetry are satisfied .    in section iv",
    "we show how the renormalizability of this broken theory follows from the o(2 ) symmetry almost trivially .",
    "however this theory is tachyonic like the symmetric theory since the quadratic terms in @xmath24 being @xmath42-dependent are treated as mass insertions and so do not modify the masses of the resulting fields in the broken phase . in section",
    "v we show how we can do computations with the fields having modified masses by invoking some additional rules regarding mass insertions in the graphs that would preserve the division into planar and non - planar diagrams so as to keep the renormalizability of theory intact .",
    "we now compute the one loop amplitudes of the symmetric theory and show that the quantum effective action is o(2 ) symmetric to one loop .",
    "the noncommutative o(2 ) invariant lagrangian is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , so the theory is tachyonic in this symmetric phase .",
    "note that there are several inequivalent orderings of the fields possible for the quartic term .",
    "we have chosen one . since the quartic term is o(2 ) invariant for any ordering one should expect o(2 ) symmetry to be preserved at the quantum level also .",
    "furthermore the uv divergences come from the planar graphs where the ordering is not important .",
