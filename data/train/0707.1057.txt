    "with the growing popularity of the web for obtaining information via search , _ sponsored search _ advertising , where advertisers pay to appear alongside the algorithmic results , has become a significant business model and is responsible for the success of internet giants such as google and yahoo !",
    "the statistics show that the growth of the overall online advertising market has been around 30% every year , as compared to the 1 - 2% of the traditional media .",
    "the first quarter of 2007 also saw a tremendous increase in revenue from online advertising that is 26% over that in 2006 .",
    "search remains the largest revenue format , accounting for more than 40% of the 2006 full year revenues of around $ 17 billion .    in a search - based advertising format",
    ", the search engine allocates the available advertising space using an auction , where individual advertisers bid upon specific keywords .",
    "when a user queries for a keyword , the search engine ( the auctioneer ) allocates the advertisement space to the bidding merchants based on their bid values and their estimated fitness values .",
    "usually , the ads appear in a separate section of the page designated as `` sponsored search results , '' which is located above or to the right of the organic / algorithmic results .",
    "each position in such a list of sponsored links is called a _ slot_. generally , users are more likely to notice and click on a higher ranked slot , leading to more traffic for the corresponding advertisers .",
    "therefore , advertisers prefer to be in higher ranked slots and compete for them . in a popular scheme , known as the cost - per - click ( cpc ) or the pay - per - click ( ppc ) model ,",
    "whenever a user clicks on an ad , the corresponding advertiser pays an amount specified by the auctioneer .    from the above description",
    ", we can note that after merchants have bid for a specific keyword , when that keyword is queried , auctioneer follows two steps .",
    "first , she allocates the slots to the advertisers .",
    "normally , this allocation is done using some _",
    "ranking function_. secondly , she decides , through some _ pricing scheme _",
    ", how much a merchant should be charged if the user clicks on her ad and in general this depends on which slot she was assigned , on her bid and that of others . in the auction formats for sponsored search ,",
    "there are two ranking functions , namely _",
    "rank by bid _ ( rbb ) and _ rank by revenue_(rbr ) and there are two pricing schemes , namely _ generalized first pricing_(gfp ) and _ generalized second pricing_(gsp ) which have been used widely . in rbb , bidders are ranked solely according to their bid values .",
    "the advertiser with the highest bid gets first slot , that with the second highest bid gets the second slot and so on . in rbr",
    ", the bidders are ranked according to the product of their bid value and _ quality score_. the quality score represents the merchant s relevance to the specific keyword , which can basically be interpreted as the possibility that her ad will be viewed if given a slot irrespective of what slot position she is given . in gfp , the bidders are essentially charged the amount they bid and in gsp they are charged an amount which is enough to ensure their current slot position .",
    "for example , under rbb allocation , gsp charges a bidder an amount equal to the bid value of the bidder just below her",
    ".    formal analysis of such sponsored search advertising models has been done extensively in recent years , from algorithmic as well as from game theoretic perspectives@xcite .",
    "for example , the existence of different types of incentive - driven nash equilibria has been established .",
    "further , the notion of a _ mediator _ in such position auctions has also been discussed@xcite .",
    "a mediator is a reliable entity , which can play on the behalf of agents in a given game , however it can not enforce the use of its services , and each agent is free to participate in the game directly . in the paper by ashlagi et al.@xcite and the references",
    "therein , the motivation for the use of mediator comes from the search of means to implement particular outcomes , such as vcg , in a given mechanism such as rbr with gsp .",
    "however , the mediators considered so far are altruistic in nature and have no incentives , and in particular , their only goal is to implement certain outcomes despite the financial cost incurred . as we know , the marketplace is mostly about incentives- a game between selfish agents- and it would be interesting to study mediators which are not altruistic .    in our present work ,",
    "we initiate a study of mediators in sponsored search auctions , which may not be altruistic in nature .",
    "we call such mediators as _ for - profit _ mediators and show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the services of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction and mediator can also obtain monetary benefit by managing the advertising burden of its advertisers and in fact at the same time being compatible with incentive constraints from the advertisers who do dot use its service .",
    "the simple intuition behind the above result comes from the observation that since the mediator has more information about and more control over the bid profile than any individual advertiser , she could possibly modify their bids , before reporting to the auctioneer ( search engine ) , in a manner to improve their payoff and could retain a fraction of the improved payoff .",
    "thus , our results show that mediators can play a significant role in sponsored search auctions , and can potentially impact the revenues earned by the auctioneer .",
    "in a formal setup , there are @xmath0 slots to be allocated among @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) bidders .",
    "a bidder @xmath3 has a true valuation @xmath4 ( known only to the bidder @xmath3 ) for the specific keyword and she bids @xmath5 . the expected _ click through rate _ ( ctr ) of an ad put by bidder @xmath3 when allocated slot @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 i.e. separable in to a position effect and an advertiser effect .",
    "@xmath8 s can be interpreted as the probability that an ad will be noticed when put in slot @xmath6 and it is assumed that @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 can be interpreted as the probability that an ad put by bidder @xmath3 will be clicked on if noticed and is refered as the _ relevance _ of bidder @xmath3 .",
    "this is the quality score used in the rbr allocation rule mentioned earlier .",
    "the payoff / utility of bidder @xmath3 when given slot @xmath6 at a price of @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 and they are assumed to be rational agents trying to maximize their payoffs . as of now , google as well as yahoo ! uses schemes closely modeled as rbr with gsp .",
    "the bidders are ranked according to @xmath13 and the slots are allocated as per this ranks . for simplicity of notation , assume that the @xmath3th bidder is the one allocated slot @xmath3 according to this ranking rule , then @xmath3 is charged an amount equal to @xmath14 .",
    "let the bid profile without any mediation be ( under rbb ) @xmath15 .",
    "now suppose that the bidders @xmath16 manage their bidding process through a same third party i.e. the mediator .",
    "since the mediator has much more information about and more control over the bid profile than the individual advertisers it is likely that she could modify the associated bids in a manner to increase her payoff and that of the associated advertisers .",
    "for example , the mediator can simply bid @xmath17 and she pays ( under gsp ) an amount @xmath18 which is much smaller than @xmath19 without mediation .",
    "mediator can distribute a part of this profit to the associated advertisers and therefore those advertisers along with the mediator profit at the expense of revenue loss by the auctioneer .",
    "this is the basic intuition behind why advertising via mediation can be good to the advertisers and the advertisers can stick to their traditional media companies even for advertising in sponsored search and other such auctions .",
    "however , the above intuition is ofcourse not a formal game - theoretic argument why the collusion via mediation will work as we do also need to argue that the other advertisers ( the advertisers who do not advertise via the mediator ) still do not have incentives to change their slot positions . in the following",
    "we present a game theoretic analysis for the position auctions via mediation and show that the intuition given above is indeed true .",
    "we consider the case where there is only one mediator and the analysis in the other cases essentially remains similar .",
    "the advertisers who bid via the mediator will be called _",
    "@xmath20-bidders _ and all other advertisers will be called _",
    "@xmath21-bidders_. the essential features of the position auctions via mediation is :    * @xmath20-bidders report their bids to the mediator .",
    "* @xmath20-bidders do not want to change the positions they get via directly reporting to the auctioneer however they give mediator the right to change their bids before reporting to the auctioneer for a potential increase in their payoffs .",
    "* mediator chooses a suitable set of bids for the associated advertisers and report accordingly to the auctioneer on behalf of them . *",
    "@xmath21-bidders report their bids to the auctioneer directly .",
    "let us first consider the rbr ( rank by revenue ) scheme with gsp(generalized second price ) currently being used by google and yahoo!. the advertisers are ranked according to @xmath22 where @xmath10 is the relevance ( quality score ) .",
    "let us name the advertisers by this ranking i.e. @xmath23 , therefore the @xmath3th bidders pays @xmath24 under gsp .",
    "let us first analyze the incentive and revenue properties for the case where the top @xmath25 advertisers are the @xmath20-bidders",
    ". we will be interested in a walrasian type of equilibria of the associated game , which is called _ symmetric _",
    "nash equilibria(sne ) as proposed by varian@xcite and edelman et al@xcite .",
    "however , similar analysis can be done for non - symmetric nash equilibria and as we will note later , the mediator and the advertisers might be even more better off in the case of non - symmetric nash equlibria . under sne",
    ", the bidders have no incentive to change to another positions even at the current price paid by the bidders currently at that position .",
    "note that this is a stronger condition than usual nash equilibrium condition which for the case of moving to higher position requires the defecting bidder to pay the bid of the advertiser holding the position currently , which is more than the price paid by her under gsp .",
    "the bids @xmath26 are at the sne of the auction without any mediation , therefore in the original game the bidders have no incentives to defect from their current positions . now the problem is to how should the mediator modify the bids of @xmath20-bidders so as to maintain the same incentives for the @xmath21-bidders and to improve her and m - bidders payoffs . here , mediator s payoff is defined to be a fixed fraction of the total improvement in payoffs from the m - bidders over what they could have obtained without using her service , up to an additive constant .",
    "let the mediator modify the bids as @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , then what @xmath31 and @xmath32 should she choose for an infinitesimally small @xmath33 .",
    "in practice , this @xmath34 can not be less than @xmath35 , however for the purpose of analysis , as in earlier works , we assume that it is a continuous parameter that can be made infinitesimally small . ] .",
    "the auctioneer sees the bid profile @xmath36 .",
    "since the original bid profile was at sne , no @xmath37 would like to deviate to any other position @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "now , only position a @xmath40 can deviate to is the position @xmath41 ( she can not do better than this by moving to @xmath42 for she will be paying same price to get less clicks ) .    the condition that the @xmath21-bidders do not want to move to position @xmath41 is    @xmath43    let @xmath44 then any selection of @xmath31 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 is fine at sne and the mediator chooses @xmath47 and an @xmath32 such that @xmath48 .",
    "note that such an @xmath49 always exists as @xmath50 ( for the @xmath21-bidders did not want to move to position @xmath41 in the original game at sne ) and @xmath32 all at once and will rather evolve to it by trying suitable @xmath51 s .",
    "] , in the above , the mediator could possibly do even better by modifying bids as @xmath52 and so on . ] .",
    "the mediator now pays @xmath53 on behalf of the @xmath20-bidders and the net total gain for mediator is @xmath54 and the mediator can distribute a fraction of this to the associated advertisers .",
    "it is clear that this is at the expense of the loss in the revenue of the auctioneer .",
    "note that in the case when there are only @xmath20-bidders and no @xmath21-bidders , the auctioneer gets the minimum price set for all the slots .",
    "now let us illustrate the above analysis by an example listed in table [ med1 ] wherein the bid profile @xmath55 is first verified to be at symmetric nash equlibrium in table [ med2 ] by recalling that to verify this we need only check the equilibrium condition for one slot up and one slot down positions ( locally envy free property ) and finally a suitable @xmath31 is chosen in table [ med3 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for - profit mediators for other mechanisms can also be designed . in particular , we discuss for - profit mediators for truthful mechanisms in the following .",
    "truthful mechanisms are considered to be very desirable from the advertisers perspective since truth - telling is a dominant strategy for every one and the advertises do not need to be sophisticated to play the auction game . however , as we argue below it is more vulnerable to for - profit mediation and even the mediators need not be sophisticated in this case , unlike the ones discussed earlier in this paper . in regard to position auctions ,",
    "aggarwal et al.@xcite presented a truthful mechanism called _ laddered auction _ , which is compatible with a given weighted ranking function such as rbr , and is the unique truthful auction given this ranking function .",
    "now , if the mediator modifies the bids of the @xmath20-bidders in a manner so that their slot positions ( i.e. ranks ) do not change , the @xmath21-bidders still report truthfully as its a dominant strategy .",
    "the mediator could choose such a minimum possible bid profile to get the best improvement in payoffs and in particular modifying every @xmath20-bidder s bid to a value only infinitesimally more than just enough to retain the position of the least ranked @xmath20-bidder suffices .",
    "sponsored search advertising is a significant growth market and is witnessing rapid growth and evolution .",
    "the analysis of the underlying models has so far primarily focused on the scenario , where advertisers / bidders interact directly with the auctioneers , i.e. , the search engines and publishers .",
    "however , the market is already witnessing the spontaneous emergence of several categories of companies who are trying to mediate or facilitate the auction process .",
    "for example , a number of different adnetworks have started proliferating , and so have companies who specialize in reselling ad inventories .",
    "hence , there is a need for analyzing the impact of such incentive driven and for - profit agents , especially as they become more sophisticated in playing the game .",
    "our results show that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the market and the emergence of incentive - driven equilibria .",
    "thus , we should expect the adword auction market to continue to develop richer structure , with room for different types of agents to coexist .",
    "another implication of our results applies to the traditional media .",
    "publishers of traditional media , such as newspapers and network tv and radio , have seen significant declines in their audience market shares , as more people have shifted to the web as the source for information and entertainment .",
    "their advertising revenues have decreased significantly as well .",
    "our results show that one way these traditional media players can retain the loyalty of their advertisers is to manage their online auctions ! by mediating their auctions , they can provide better payoffs to their clients , and thus prevent them from switching allegiance to the online giants , such as google and yahoo ! other than creating a new revenue source for the traditional media businesses , it would allow them to retain their own networks and give them precious time to reposition themselves and figure out the best possible ways to take their content online , and compete effectively in a new market space .",
    "our present work on the diversification in the internet economy is only the tip of the iceberg .",
    "further investigation is likely to give better insights .",
    "for example , one natural constraint on the sponsored search auction comes from the fact that there is a limit on the number of slots , in particular for the popular keywords , which limits the number of advertisers that can be accommodated and it is likely that new market mechanisms as well as new for - profit agents will emerge to combat or to make profit from the opportunities created by this capacity constraint , leading to a diversification in the market .",
    "we are investigating this direction in a related work@xcite .",
    "further , even in the case of for - profit mediators studied in the present work , several directions are left to explore .",
    "for example , do there exist mechanisms which are impervious to collusion via for - profit mediation and if they do how do they effect the revenue of the auctioneer ? furthermore , more sophisticated mediators such as where @xmath20-bidders need not be concecutive should also be investigated and in general if the mediator is sophisticated enough to exploit her best possible strategy , how does the modified profile look at equilibrium ?",
    "furthermore , for - profit mediators for other auction formats should also be interesting to study",
