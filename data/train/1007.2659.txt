    "white dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars .",
    "indeed , more than 97% of all stars , including our sun , are expected to ultimately end their lives passively , getting rid of their outer layers and forming white dwarfs .",
    "for this reason , the present population of white dwarfs contains valuable information about the evolution of individual stars from birth to death and about the star formation rate throughout the history of our galaxy .",
    "these stellar remnants are the cores of low- and intermediate - mass hydrogen burning stars , and have no appreciable sources of nuclear energy .",
    "hence , as time passes by , white dwarfs will slowly cool and radiate the stored thermal energy , becoming dimmer and dimmer .",
    "the interest in the study of white dwarf stars in recent years has been triggered in part by their importance relative to some open questions in other fields of astrophysics  see the recent reviews of winget & kepler ( 2008 ) , fontaine & brassard ( 2008 ) , and also the valuable early reviews on the physics and evolutionary properties of white dwarfs of koester & chanmugam ( 1990 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1990 ) .",
    "the huge amount of high - quality observational data of these stars , obtained from both space - borne observatories and from ground - based telescopes , has made possible to use the white dwarf cooling sequence as independent age and distance indicators for a wide variety of stellar populations . as a matter of fact , an accurate knowledge of the rate at which white dwarfs cool constitutes a fundamental issue and provides an independent cosmic clock to constrain the age and previous history of the galactic populations including the disk ( winget et al .",

    "in addition , because white dwarf progenitors lose their outer layers  which are carbon- , nitrogen- and oxygen - rich  at the top of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , they are significant contributors to the chemical evolution of the galaxy . more than 10,000 spectroscopically identified white dwarfs with determined effective temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and gravities ( @xmath1 ) have been currently detected ( kleinman et al . 2004 ; kepler et al . 2007 ) , giving us the opportunity to explore the white dwarf mass distribution , which ultimately provides insights into mass - loss processes during stellar evolution and the mass budget of the galaxy .",
    "white dwarfs usually play a key role in some types of interacting binaries , such as cataclysmic variables , where mass transfer from a companion star onto the white dwarf gives rise to very strong energetic events .",
    "in addition , white dwarfs in binary systems are the candidate progenitors of type ia supernovae , which are thought to be the result of the explosion of a white dwarf exceeding the chandrasekhar limit due to accretion from a mass - losing companion star .",
    "understanding the evolutionary and structural properties of white dwarfs helps improving our konwledge of supernova events , with the important underlying implications for cosmology .",
    "also , the presence of white dwarfs in binary systems with millisecond pulsar companions allows to constrain the age of millisecond pulsars and thereby the timescale for magnetic field decay ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "2005 ) .    surveys carried out by the macho team ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ; alcock et al . 1997 ; alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that a substantial fraction of the halo dark matter could be in the form of very cool white dwarfs . since then , the eros ( lasserre et al . 2000 ; goldman et al .",

    "1999 ) and supermacho ( becker et al . 2005 ) teams have monitored millions of stars during several years in both the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) to search for microlensing events .",
    "most of them have challenged the results of the macho experiment  see , for instance , yoo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and references therein .",
    "in addition , there have been claims that white dwarfs could be the stellar objects reported in the hubble deep field ( ibata et al .",
    "1999 ; mndez & minniti 2000 ) . however , these claims remain inconclusive for lack of spectroscopic identifications .",
    "the hubble deep field south has provided another opportunity to test the contribution of white dwarfs to the galactic dark matter . in particular ,",
    "three white dwarf candidates among several faint blue objects which exhibit significant proper motion have been recently found ( kilic et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they are assumed to belong to the thick - disk or halo populations .",
    "if these are spectroscopically confirmed it would imply that white dwarfs account for @xmath2 of the galactic dark matter , which would fit comfortably within the results of the eros team .",
    "all in all , the study of the white dwarf population has important ramifications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the milky way ( daz  pinto et al . 1994 ; isern et al . 1998 ; torres et al . 1998 ; garca  berro et al . 1999 ; torres et al . 2001 ; torres et al . 2002 ; garca  berro et al . 2004 ; camacho et al . 2007 ; torres et al . 2008 ) .",
    "besides the implications of the white dwarf cooling theory for the study of stellar populations , white dwarfs constitute also extremely interesting objects in their own right .",
    "typically , the mass of white dwarfs is about half that of the sun , and their size resembles that of a planet .",
    "their compact nature translates into large average densities , large surface gravities and low luminosities . at the extremely high densities of white dwarfs , electrons become degenerate and quantum mechanics",
    " the pauli principle  determines their equation of state , their structure , and the existence of a limiting mass above which no stable white dwarf can exist ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) .",
    "these properties turn white dwarfs into extremely attractive objects as cosmic laboratories to study numerous physical processes under extreme conditions that can not be achieved in terrestrial laboratories . just to indicate a few ones",
    ", we mention the equation of state , crystallization and physical separation processes at very high density ( garca - berro et al .",

    "; isern et al . 1991",
    "; segretain et al . 1994 ; isern et al . 1997 ; winget et al 2009 ; garca - berro et al . 2010 ) , the physics of neutrino emission ( winget et al . 2004 ) , the existence of axions ( isern et al . 2008 ) and the variation of fundamental constants ( garca  berro et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the study of the structure and evolution of white dwarfs thus allows us to test our current understanding of the behavior of matter at extreme densities and pressures .",
    "in the course of their evolution , white dwarfs cross several pulsational instability phases .",
    "the pulsational pattern of variable white dwarfs has become a powerful tool for probing their inner regions that would otherwise remain unaccessible to direct observations ( fontaine & brassard 2008 ; winget & kepler 2008 ) . the recent development of white dwarf asteroseismological techniques , combined with the improvements in the evolutionary models for these stars have allowed to face some key problems in astrophysics , such as the core chemical composition of low - mass stars and the implications for thermonuclear reaction rates , and the theory of crystallization at high densities . in addition , pulsating white dwarfs are powerful tools which have applications beyond stellar astrophysics . in particular , pulsating white dwarfs can be used to constrain the properties of elementary particles , such as axions and neutrinos ( isern et al . 1992 ; crsico et al . 2001b ; isern et al . 2010 ) .",
    "all these potential applications of white dwarfs have led to a renewed interest in the calculation of full evolutionary models for these stars . in this work",
    "we discuss the essentials of the physics of white dwarf evolution in order to understand the reasons that make these stars excellent chronometers and potential tools with a wide variety of applications . in sect .",
    "[ essentials ] , we will describe a simple model for white dwarf evolution , making use of the fact that these stars are strongly degenerate stellar configurations , and thus taking advantage of the fact that the mechanical and thermal structures can be treated separately .",
    "this simple model will allow us to understand the evolution of white dwarf as a simple cooling process . in sect .",

    "this is done in sect .",
    "[ families ] .",
    "the observational aspects of white dwarfs are briefly touched upon .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the review articles of koester ( 2002 ) , hansen & liebert ( 2003 )  for general overviews of the field  barstow ( 2006 )  for hot white dwarfs  and winget & kepler ( 2008 ) and fontaine & brassard ( 2008 )  for recent accounts of the observational aspects and applications of pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "however , we will discuss in some detail the statistical properties of the white dwarf population , and in particular , the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "white dwarf stars have captured the attention of astronomers since their early discovery in 1914 , when h. russell ( russell 1914 ) noticed that the star now known as 40 eridani b , was located well below the main sequence on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , see fig .",
    "he rapidly realized that this star was characterized by a very small radius ( hence the `` dwarf '' in the name ) , comparable to the size of the earth . but",
    "a major puzzle was posed by the discovery that the companion star to sirius , sirus b , was also a white dwarf .",
    "the determination of the spectral type ( adams 1915 ) and luminosity of sirius b provided the first estimate of its radius .",
    "because the mass of this star was known to be about @xmath3 , it was possible to infer the mean density of a white dwarf for the first time : @xmath4 gr/@xmath5 .",
    "the measurement of the gravitational redshift by adams ( 1925 ) resulting from the strong gravity of sirius b provided an independent test of the high density of this white dwarf , and at the same time a confirmation of general relativity .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting to note that nowadays the accepted value of the effective temperature of the star is much larger than the originally estimated , thus implying a much larger average density of about @xmath6 gr/@xmath5 .",
    "it was clear for astronomers that these stars were indeed a new class of star quite different from ordinary stars .",
    "but the extraordinary value of the density derived for sirius b was difficult to explain at that time , and the answer had to wait until the advent of quantum mechanics .",
    "as a matter of fact , the existence of white dwarfs provided one of the first tests of the quantum theory of matter and a demonstration of the pauli exclusion principle for electrons .",
    "the realization that completely degenerate electrons should be the source of internal pressure in the interiors of white dwarf ( fowler 1926 ) led to the conclusion that white dwarfs should be stable objects , and established the study of the zero - temperature configurations .",
    "subsequent investigations by anderson ( 1929 ) , stoner ( 1930 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) , demonstrated the fundamental conceptual coupling of relativity and quantum statistical mechanics , which yielded another key breakthrough , the existence of a limiting mass , where gravitational forces overwhelm degenerate electron pressure , and above which no stable white dwarf can exist .",
    "this limiting mass , also known as the chandrasekhar limiting mass , constitutes one of the most important concepts in stellar astrophysics , and it is responsible for the differences in the evolutionary properties of low and and high mass stars an in their final outcomes .",

    "the number of known white dwarfs has increased significantly from one in 1914 in the first herztsprung - russell diagram to about 1,000 in the 1970s as a result of targeted searches for high proper motion stars .",
    "more recently , imaging surveys provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have largely expanded the number of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs to about 10,000 ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) , including the detection of ultracool white dwarfs , pulsating h - rich white dwarfs and h - deficient white dwarfs .",
    "this increase in the number of detected white dwarfs has extraordinarily improved our knowledge of the white dwarf luminosity and mass functions .",
    "in addition , spectroscopy of this much enlarged sample led to the discovery of new and interesting species of degenerate stars ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ; koester et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "it is now accepted that white dwarfs constitute the end - product of all stars with initial masses up to @xmath8 ( siess 2007 ) .",
    "most of the mass of a typical white dwarf is contained in its core , which is made of the products of he burning , mostly carbon and oxygen .",
    "small amounts of h and he are left over after the mass - loss phases have ended . taking into account the previous thermonuclear history and the efficiency of gravitational settling , it is expected that the structure of a typical white dwarf corresponds to that of a compositionally stratified object with a mass of about @xmath9 consisting of a carbon - oxygen core surrounded by a thin , he - rich envelope  of at most @xmath10  surrounded itself by a thinner h - rich layer of @xmath11 .",
    "although very thin , the outer layers are extremely opaque to radiation and regulate the energy outflow of the star , thus playing , as we saw , a crucial role in the evolution of a white dwarf .    an important property of the white dwarf population is their mass distribution , which conveys information about the evolution of our galaxy . from the mass distribution of white",
    "dwarfs it is possible to constrain the late stages of stellar evolution since it reveals the amount of mass lost during the lifetime of the star from the main sequence ( liebert et al .",
    "the surface gravities and effective temperatures of white dwarfs are usually determined from model atmosphere fits to spectral lines . on average ,",
    "it turns out that white dwarfs are characterized by surface gravities @xmath12 .",
    "coupled with theoretical mass - radius relations , this yields average masses of @xmath13 . in passing ,",
    "we note that for cool white dwarfs , h and he spectral lines are not visible and the stellar radius ( and mass ) have to be inferred from accurate trigonometric parallaxes and mass - radius relations .",
    "typical white dwarf mass distributions ( see fig . [ massdist ] ) show that the values of the masses of most white dwarfs cluster around this value ( kepler et al .",
    "2007 ) , with a tail extending towards high stellar masses .",
    "the rather narrow mass distribution of white dwarfs is a remarkable characteristic of these stars .",
    "massive white dwarfs have spectroscopically determined masses within 1.0 and @xmath14 and are believed to harbor cores composed mainly of oxygen and neon  at least for non - rotating stars ( domnguez et al .",
    "1996 ; ritossa et al . 1996 )  in contrast to average - mass white dwarfs , for which carbon - oxygen cores are expected .",
    "the existence of such massive white dwarfs has been suggested to be the result of the merger of two averaged - mass white dwarfs in close binaries ( guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ; lorn - aguilar et al . 2009 ) or of the evolution of heavy - weight intermediate - mass single stars that have experienced repeated carbon - burning shell flashes ( ritossa et al .",
    "finally , the white dwarf mass distribution comprises a population of low - mass remnants .",
    "because low - mass progenitors would need exceedingly large ages to reach the white dwarf stage , these low - mass white dwarfs are mostly produced in binary systems , where the stellar evolution has been truncated by mass transfer ( sarna et .",
    "al 1999 ) .",
    "fifty years ago ( schmidt 1959 ) it was first recognized that the coolest and faintest white dwarfs are the remnants of the earliest stars formed in the solar neighborhood , and that the cooling theory which we will review below could be very useful to estimate the time elapsed since star formation started in the galactic disk .",
    "the fundamental tool for studying the properties of the white dwarf population is the white dwarf luminosity function , which is defined as the number of white dwarfs per cubic parsec and unit bolometric magnitude ( or luminosity ) as a function of the bolometric magnitude ( or luminosity ) .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function not only can provide valuable information about the age , structure and evolution of our galaxy but it also provides an independent test of the theory of dense plasmas ( isern et al .",
    "1997 ; isern et al .",
    "also , it directly constrains the current death rate of low- and intermediate - mass stars in the local neighborhood which , in turn , provides an important tool to evaluate pre - white dwarf stellar evolutionary sequences .",
    "furthermore , the relative simplicity of the structure and evolution of white dwarfs makes them extremely useful as astroparticle physics laboratories ( raffelt 1996 ; crsico et al .",
    "however , in order to use the white dwarf luminosity function to attack these astrophysical problems , it is necessary to have good observational data , good evolutionary models and good input physics .",
    "three decades later , the white dwarf luminosity function has helped in dealing with all these problems and many more .",
    "the observational white dwarf luminosity function , its uses and inherent limitations have been discussed over the years in a number of excellent papers ( weidemann 2000 ; mndez & ruiz 2001 ; bergeron et al .",
    "2001 ; hansen & liebert 2003 ) .    at the present time , the most promising source of large numbers of new white dwarfs in both",
    "the disk and halo is the sdss ( york et al .",
    "thus far , about 10,000 white dwarfs have been identified in the sdss ( harris et al .",
    "2006 ; eisenstein et al . 2006 ; degennaro et al .",
    "2008 ) using the reduced proper motion diagram first described in luyten ( 1922 ) . for this sample , the disk white dwarf luminosity function was constructed using improved proper motions based on comparison of positions between the sdss and usno surveys , high quality @xmath15 photometry , and improved atmospheric models .",
    "the resulting white dwarf luminosity function is surprisingly smooth and drops off abruptly at @xmath16  see fig .",
    "[ wdlf ] .",
    "traditionally , white dwarfs have been classified into two distinct families according to the main constituent of their surface .",
    "spectroscopic observations reveal that the surface composition of most white dwarfs consists almost entirely of h with at most traces of other elements .",
    "these are the so - called da white dwarfs and they comprise about 85% of all white dwarfs  see eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and references therein . to the other family",
    "belong the h - deficient white dwarfs with he - rich atmospheres , usually known as non - da white dwarfs , which make up to almost 15% of the total population .",
    "h - deficient white dwarfs are thought to be the result of late thermal flashes experienced by post - agb progenitors or of merger episodes .",
    "the non - da white dwarfs are usually divided into several different subclasses : the do spectral type ( with effective temperatures 45000 k @xmath17 k ) that shows relatively strong lines of singly ionized he ( heii ) , the db type ( 11000 k @xmath18 k ) , with strong neutral he ( hei ) lines , and the dc , dq , and dz types ( @xmath19 k ) showing traces of carbon and metals in their spectra . as a",
    "do white dwarf evolves , the heii recombines to form hei , ultimately transforming into a db white dwarf .",
    "the transition from do to the cooler db stage is interrupted by the non - da gap ( that occurs at 30000",
    "k @xmath20 k ) where few objects with h - deficient atmospheres have been observed ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) . to this list",
    ", we have to add those white dwarfs with hybrid atmospheres or peculiar abundances , and the recent discovery of a new white dwarf spectral type with carbon - dominated atmospheres , the `` hot dq '' white dwarfs , with @xmath21 k ( dufour et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ) .",
    "hot dq white dwarfs are thought to be the cooler descendants of some pg 1159 stars , and the result of convective mixing at smaller effective temperatures ( dufour et al .",
    "2008a ; althaus et al .",
    "2009b ) .",
    "although this classification is in line with our understanding that most giant stars will evolve into white dwarfs with either h - rich atmospheres or h - deficient composition , the existence of some of these white dwarfs poses a real challenge to the theory of stellar evolution , which can not adequately explain their origin .",
    "finally , there is ample observational evidence that individual white dwarfs undergo spectral evolution , i.e. , the surface composition of a given white dwarf may change as it evolves as a result of competing processes such as convection , mass - loss episodes , accretion , radiative levitation and gravitational settling .",
    "the interplay between these processes may help to understand the different evolutionary paths that white dwarfs may follow as the surface temperature decreases , see fig .",
    "[ spectral ] .",
    "for instance , the empirical evidence that the ratio of da to non - da white dwarfs changes with effective temperature and the existence of the non - da gap are interpreted as the result of changes in the surface composition from he - dominated to h - dominated and vice versa as evolution proceeds .",
    "also , the presence of traces of h in the outer layers of the hot h - deficient white dwarfs like pg 1159s or dos can turn the spectral type of these white dwarfs into that of a da type as a result of gravitational settling .",
    "white dwarfs span a wide range of both effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "values of @xmath0 range from about 150000 k for the hottest members to 4000 k for the coolest degenerate dwarfs .",
    "the stellar luminosity ranges from roughly @xmath22 to about @xmath23 @xmath24 for the faintest observed white dwarfs .",
    "the majority of known white dwarfs have temperatures higher than the sun and hence the `` white '' in their name . because the intrinsic faintness of most white dwarfs , quantitative studies of these stars , traditionally based on photometric and spectroscopic observations , are restricted to nearby objects .",
    "hence , the vast majority of observed white dwarfs are representative of the solar neighborhood .",
    "other observational techniques and the advent of large - scale ground - based surveys and deep hubble space telescope exposures , have revealed the presence of white dwarf populations located well beyond our own neighborhood , such as in distant open and globular clusters and , most probably , in the galactic halo , thus enabling us to extract information and to constrain the properties of such populations .",
    "as previously mentioned , white dwarfs have numerous applications in different fields of astrophysics .",
    "in particular , the use of white dwarfs as accurate cosmic clocks has led over the years to the development of detailed evolutionary models of these stars , including sophisticated constitutive microphysics . before describing such models",
    ", we will discuss a simple treatment of white dwarf evolution . at the high densities of white dwarf interiors , matter is completely pressure - ionized and the chemical potential of the electron gas is much larger than the thermal energy .",
    "this means that the fermi - dirac distribution that characterizes electrons reduces to a step - like function .",
    "in particular , all the energy states up to the fermi energy ( @xmath25 ) are occupied .",
    "thus , to a very good approximation , electrons are almost completely degenerate , and those electrons with energies close to @xmath26 will make the largest contribution to the pressure .",
    "hence , to a first approximation , the mechanical structure of white dwarfs can be described in terms of a fermi gas at zero temperature .",
    "a key feature to understand the evolution of white dwarfs is that in degenerate configurations , the mechanical and thermal structures are , to a good approximation , decoupled from each other and , thus , can be treated separately .",
    "this basic property of degenerate structures will allow us to derive a simple picture of how white dwarfs evolve with time and to discuss the role played by the different physical processes in the evolution of these stars .",
    "indeed , the remaining thermal reservoir ( which implies @xmath27 ) is responsible for radiation and , thus , for the evolution of white dwarfs . instead , for the mechanical structure , the limit @xmath28 is usually assumed .",
    "accordingly , in what follows , we will treat the mechanical and thermal structures separately .",
    "we begin by describing the structure of white dwarfs , as given by the zero - temperature approximation .",
    "then in sect .",
    "[ mestel ] we will describe a simple model to understand the basic thermal properties of white dwarfs responsible for their evolution .",
    "we will show that evolution can be described essentially as a rather simple cooling process , where the source of star luminosity is approximately provided by the change in the internal energy stored in the ions .      in this approximation ,",
    "the structure of a white dwarf is determined by the pressure of non - interacting completely degenerate electrons . in the limit of complete degeneracy , the electron pressure can be easily derived by considering only the energy states up to @xmath29 .",

    ", a one - parameter family of models is thus obtained integrating eq .",
    "( [ chandraeq ] ) for different values of the central density , thus defining implicitly a relation between mass and radius such that the more massive the star , the smaller its size .",
    "this is the famous mass - radius relation for white dwarf stars . in the limit @xmath53 ,",
    "the relativistic `` softening '' of the equation of state ( for relativistic electrons , @xmath54 ) causes the radius @xmath55 to become zero , while the mass approaches a limiting value @xmath56 , the chandrasekhar limiting mass . according to our present understanding of stellar evolution",
    ", a core made of carbon and oxygen is expected for most white dwarfs . in this case ,",
    "@xmath57 , and the chandrasekhar mass becomes @xmath58 . for larger masses ,",
    "gravitational forces overwhelm the electron pressure support , and no stable white dwarf can exist .",
    "the theoretical mass - radius relation for white dwarfs , which can be improved by including corrections to the equation of state and finite - temperature effects , is an accepted underlying assumption in nearly all studies of white dwarfs properties , including the white dwarf mass distribution and the luminosity function , which in turn convey important information about galactic evolution and about the late stages of stellar evolution . because of this , it is essential to provide observational support for this theoretical relation .",
    "this means that it is necessary to obtain independent measures of the mass and radius of individual white dwarfs .",
    "the best way to do this is for white dwarfs in visual binaries , where the stellar mass can be inferred from kepler s law and the radius can be obtained from a fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf atmosphere , once the distance to the binary system is known .",
    "independent determinations of radius and mass can also be obtained from white dwarfs with measured gravitational redshifts in binary systems .",
    "although independent mass and radius determinations are available only for a few white dwarfs , they strongly support the theoretical mass - radius relation and the existence of a limiting mass .",
    "another remarkable consequence of these observational determinations is that they discard the existence of white dwarfs with h - rich cores .",
    "note that for white dwarfs with h - rich cores ( @xmath59 ) , the mass of the equilibrium configuration is much larger for a given stellar radius than that resulting from a carbon - oxygen composition .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the stellar evolution theory , which predicts that h is burnt into heavier elements in evolutionary stages previous to the white dwarf formation",
    ".    the chandrasekhar limiting mass is one of the most important concepts in astrophysics .",
    "the existence of a limiting mass has strong implications not only for the theory of white dwarfs itself , but also for stellar evolution in general .",
    "this is particularly true regarding the occurrence of mass - loss episodes : low - mass stars must lose a large fraction of their mass at some point of their evolution to end - up as white dwarfs with masses smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the concept of the chandrasekhar limiting mass is intimately connected with the most energetic events known in the universe : supernovae . those supernovae which do not show h in their spectra",
    " known as type i supernova ( snia ) , or thermonuclear supernovae  are thought to be the result of a instability of a white dwarf with a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "one of the two proposed mechanisms to explain the properties of snia involves a massive white dwarf progenitor in a binary system accreting from a non - degenerate companion  see branch et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and kotak ( 2008 ) for a recent review .",
    "the second mechanism involves the merger of two white dwarfs with sufficiently large stellar masses due to the secular radiation of gravitational waves in a close binary system  see lorn ",
    "aguilar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and references therein for recent three - dimensional calculations of this phenomenon .",
    "in the first scenario , mass transfer from an accretion disk onto the massive white dwarf may cause the white dwarf to exceed the chandrasekhar mass , thus leading to a thermonuclear runaway and a explosion that completely disrupts the white dwarf . in the second scenario ,",
    "the coalescence process may lead to high enough temperatures to ignite the degenerate merger remnant , leading again to the same final output . on the other hand ,",
    "core collapse supernovae arise from stars with degenerate cores with masses larger than the chandraskhar limiting mass .",
    "the zero - temperature model we have described in the previous section provides an appropriate description of the mechanical structure of white dwarfs .",
    "however , white dwarfs are not zero temperature stars .",
    "in fact , they are observed to have high surface temperatures and to lose energy , which implies the existence of temperature gradients , and consequently of higher interior temperatures .",
    "thus , white dwarfs are not static objects and are expected to experience some kind of evolution . as we already mentioned , the advantage of dealing with degenerate configurations is that the mechanical and thermal properties are effectively decoupled from each other .",
    "this allows us to capture the main features of white dwarf evolution by means of a very simple model , which is often referred to as the mestel s model ( mestel 1952 ) . here",
    ", the problem of the evolution of white dwarfs reduces essentially to two main aspects .",
    "the first of these consists in the determination of the total energy content , @xmath61 , of the star , whilst the second one is the determination of the rate at which this energy is radiated away .",
    "the first problem involves a detailed knowledge of the thermodynamics of the degenerate core of the white dwarf , which contains more than 99@xmath62 of the mass , and the structure of which is specified , as we saw , by completely degenerate electrons ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "an important property of the core , which simplifies the evaluation of @xmath61 , is that it is characterized by an almost constant temperature , @xmath63 .",
    "this is because degenerate electrons are very efficient at transporting energy , and thus a very small temperature gradient is required to transport the energy flux in the core . although the assumption of an isothermal core is not valid in young and hot white dwarfs , where neutrinos constitute a main energy sink , it is completely justified in evolved and cool white dwarfs .",
    "the second problem involves the solution of the equation of energy transfer through the non - degenerate envelope above the core . in the envelope ,",
    "energy is transferred by radiation and/or convection , which are less efficient mechanisms than electron conduction .",
    "in fact , the extremely large temperature drop between the core and the surface occurs mainly in the opaque envelope .",
    "because of this , the envelopes of white dwarfs play a key role in white dwarf evolution , since they control the rate at which energy is transferred from the core into space .    in",
    "what follows , a simple approach to solve the problem of energy transfer in the outer layers of a white dwarf will be explained . by making reasonable simplifications ,",
    "simple power law relations between the surface luminosity , the stellar mass and the central temperature of the white dwarf will be derived .",
    "the first of these simplifications concerns the way in which energy is transported throughout the envelope .",
    "we will assume that energy is transferred only by radiation , which is true except for cool white dwarfs , where convection is the dominant mechanism of transport in the outer layers .",
    "in this case , the structure of the envelope is specified by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , eq .",
    "( [ eh ] ) , and the equation of radiative transfer , as given by the photon diffusion equation ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 )    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the luminosity or the net flux of energy transported through the sphere of radius @xmath35 ( erg /s ) , and @xmath66 is the radiative opacity .",
    "a common approximation for the radiative opacity is to adopt kramers s law for bound - free and free - free processes : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 depends on the chemical composition of the envelope .",
    "we will also assume that the envelope is thin enough that @xmath69 ( low density ) , and that any source or sink of energy can be neglected in the envelope , so that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 means the surface luminosity . under these assumptions , the equation for the thermal structure of the envelope can be derived by dividing the hydrostatic equilibrium equation by eq .",
    "( [ foton ] ) :    @xmath72    to integrate this equation the equation of state for the envelope must be specified .",
    "because white dwarfs are observed to have high effective temperatures , and considering the smaller densities characterizing the very outer layers , we expect the envelope to be non - degenerate .",
    "thus , we will assume that the equation of state is that of a non - degenerate , ideal gas ( ions and electrons ) , which is given by    @xmath73    here @xmath74 is the gas constant , @xmath75 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath76 the atomic weight , @xmath77 the charge number , and @xmath78 the abundance by mass fraction of the chemical species @xmath79 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ dpdt ] ) becomes now    @xmath80    we integrate this equation from the surface , where we assume @xmath81 and @xmath28 , to the base of the envelope as defined by the transition layer .",
    "this layer is an idealized representation of the abrupt transition that separates the inner degenerate core from the thin , non - degenerate envelope",
    ". the integration yields    @xmath82    which provides a relation between the density and temperature at the transition layer ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively ) for a white dwarf characterized by stellar mass @xmath85 and surface luminosity @xmath71 . at the transition layer ,",
    "the pressure of degenerate electrons is equal to the pressure of an ideal gas ( pressure is continuous across the transition layer ) .",
    "this gives us another relation between density and temperature at the transition layer .",
    "note that we consider non - relativistic electrons . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath86 and eqs .",
    "( [ eos ] ) reduce to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath88    because we have assumed that the entire core is isothermal , we can replace @xmath89 by the core temperature , @xmath90 . finally , from the last two equations we arrive at a simple power law relation between the surface luminosity , the stellar mass and the central temperature of the white dwarf :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are , respectively , the metallicity of the envelope and the h abundance by mass .",
    "although some of the assumptions made in the treatment of the envelope are not usually verified in white dwarfs , the simple relation given by eq .",
    "( [ ltc ] ) enables us to infer some important features of these stars .",
    "specifically , for typical compositions and a stellar mass of @xmath94 , we find that for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the central temperatures are of the order of @xmath97 k and @xmath98 k , respectively .",
    "the high central temperatures expected for high - luminosity white dwarfs discard the presence of h in the degenerate core .",
    "in fact , simple stability arguments show that at the high densities of the core , stable nuclear burning is not possible , because the white dwarf would be destroyed by a thermal runaway ( mestel 1952 ) .",
    "the fact that no nuclear sources can be present in the core of white dwarfs at their birth , constrains their origin and suggests that white dwarfs must be the result of complete h exhaustion occurred at some point in the evolution of their progenitors .    before proceeding forward",
    ", we can make a simple estimate of the radial extent of the envelope of a typical white dwarf . to this end , we use eqs .",
    "( [ foton ] ) and ( [ densi ] ) , and kramers law to obtain    @xmath99    we integrate this equation over the radial extent of the envelope    @xmath100    to obtain    @xmath101    for a low - luminosity white dwarf with @xmath94 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 k , we get @xmath104 km . thus , a very thin envelope isolates the degenerate core from the outer space . through this thin envelope ,",
    "the temperature drops appreciably from the central to surface values .",
    "although the envelope controls the rate at which energy is transferred from the core to the space , it has nevertheless little influence on the structure of the white dwarf .",
    "in fact , the radius of a white dwarf is well approximated by the calculations that assume complete degeneracy throughout .",
    "the absence of nuclear energy sources in the white dwarf interiors brings us to our first point , namely the total energy content , @xmath61 , of a white dwarf .",
    "the precise question to be answered is the following one .",
    "if there is no stable nuclear burning , which energy sources are involved when a normal white dwarf radiates energy ?",
    "it is clear that some energy source or reservoir must be present , since if this was not the case it may not shine .",
    "we will focus on this issue in what follows .",
    "the first point to be noted is that although white dwarfs can not contract appreciably , because of electron degeneracy  under the conditions of strong degeneracy , pressure is almost independent of temperature  the residual contraction resulting from the gradually decreasing ion pressure plays an important role in the energy budget of the star .",
    "this is because white dwarfs are compact objects , and hence a small change of the radius releases an important amount of gravitational energy .",
    "for instance , for a white dwarf with @xmath105 , a change of 1% in the radius produces a change in the gravitational energy    @xmath106    at a typical luminosity of @xmath107 , this energy would be lost in about @xmath108 yr .",
    "thus , the energy released by contraction is by no means negligible .",
    "it can be shown from the virial theorem for degenerate configurations that the gravitational energy released during contraction is of the same order of magnitude of the stellar luminosity @xmath71 .    if we neglect neutrino losses , the total energy content of the white dwarf results from contributions of ions , electrons and gravitational energy , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "the luminosity is given by the temporal decrease of the total energy @xmath61 :    @xmath110    according to the virial theorem for degenerate configurations , the release of gravitational energy is used to increase the fermi energy of the electrons , @xmath111  specifically the density - dependent contribution of the energy of electrons ( koester 1978 ) .",
    "this behavior is different from that of a non - degenerate gas , where the released gravitational energy is used to increase the internal energy of both ions and electrons .",
    "this gives rise to an important simplification of the treatment , since in order to compute the temporal change of @xmath61 , only the changes in the _ thermal _ contribution to @xmath61 need to be considered .",
    "indeed , if we assume that the core is isothermal , the luminosity of the star can be written in terms of the decrease of the central temperature as    @xmath112    where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the total ion and electron thermal energies .",
    "thus , in terms of the specific heat of ions and electrons , the luminosity equation becomes    @xmath115    where @xmath116 and @xmath85 is the white dwarf mass .",
    "thus , we have a simple relation between the luminosity and the rate of change of the central temperature .",
    "clearly , the source of luminosity of a white dwarf is essentially the decrease in the thermal energy of ions and electrons . because of this",
    ", white dwarf evolution is described as a cooling process . however , at low temperatures , @xmath117 , since strongly degenerate electrons barely contribute to the specific heat .",
    "in fact , for strongly degenerate electrons , we have    @xmath118    thus , we arrive at the core feature of white dwarf evolution : the source of luminosity of a cool white dwarf is basically the change of the internal energy stored in the ions .    using the relation between luminosity and central temperature given by eq .",
    "( [ ltc ] ) , which reads @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a constant , we get    @xmath121    we now assume an ideal gas for a single ion .",
    "that is , we adopt @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the atomic weight , and integrate eq .",
    "( [ eqcool ] ) from an initial time @xmath124 to the present time @xmath125 .",
    "we define the _ cooling time _ as @xmath126 , and the following cooling law is obtained    @xmath127    where it has been assumed that the central temperature at the beginning of white dwarf formation is much larger than the present central temperature of the white dwarf .",
    "this is the mestel s model of white dwarf evolution ( mestel 1952 ) , and it provides a simple power law relation between the cooling time of a white dwarf , and its stellar mass , surface luminosity , and core chemical composition . for @xmath128 ( a pure carbon core ) , typical cooling ages for the faintest observed white dwarfs ( @xmath129 ) of @xmath130 yr are derived .",
    "these evolutionary timescales are sufficiently long that white dwarfs remain visible for a long time .",
    "thus , the white dwarf phase constitutes a major phase in stellar life .",
    "cool white dwarfs are very old objects , and considering the relative simplicity of the physical processes responsible for their evolution , these stars turn out to be robust tools to date stellar populations .",
    "although mestel s model is the simplest picture of how white dwarfs evolve , it captures the essentials of the physics of white dwarf evolution .",
    "it shows that the cooling time of a white dwarf is related essentially to its core chemical composition , its mass and its luminosity .",
    "the following major features emerge :    1 .",
    "the cooling times depend on the core chemical composition ( @xmath123 ) of the white dwarf : oxygen white dwarfs are expected to cool faster than carbon white dwarfs because the specific heat per gram of oxygen is smaller than that of carbon  there are more ions in a gram of carbon than in a gram of oxygen .",
    "because of their larger thermal content , in principle , massive white dwarfs are characterized by longer cooling times .",
    "moreover , it has to be taken into account as well that these white dwarfs also have much smaller radii and , thus , they have smaller luminosities .",
    "3 .   the cooling times increase as the luminosity decreases .",
    "as previously mentioned , the white dwarf luminosity function gives the number of white dwarfs per unit volume and interval of magnitude , as a function of the magnitude . to a first approximation ,",
    "this number is proportional to the characteristic cooling time , @xmath131 . according to mestel",
    "s law , more and more white dwarfs should be observed at fainter luminosities , as it is indeed the case , see fig .",
    "[ wdlf ] . nonetheless , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ wdlf ] , the white dwarf luminosity function presents an abrupt drop - off at very low luminosities ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this steep cutoff can not be explained within the frame of mestel s theory .",
    "[ lf ] depicts a schematic view of the observed white dwarf luminosity function together with the prediction given by the mestel cooling law .",
    "clearly , the theoretical model predicts that the number of white dwarfs should increase monotonically with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and observation motivated the exploration of physical effects that might be responsible for shortening the cooling times at very low luminosities .",
    "however , nowadays we know that this shortage of white dwarfs at very low luminosities is a consequence of the finite age of the galactic disk .",
    "namely , we know that the origin of the cutoff is due entirely to the fact that the coolest white dwarfs have not had time enough to cool down to luminosities lower than that of the observed drop - off .    however , let us go step by step .",
    "the mestel model is a reasonable description of the behavior of real white dwarfs only at intermediate luminosities , where the assumptions of ideal gas , isothermal core , and non - degenerate radiative envelope are more or less valid .",
    "nevertheless , it requires major improvements if we want to use cool white dwarfs as reliable cosmic clocks . in what follows",
    ", we will comment on the main basic improvements to be considered in the physics of white dwarfs and on the expected impact on the cooling times .      at the high densities characteristic of white dwarf interiors , matter is completely pressure - ionized . as early recognized ( kirshnitz 1960 ; abrikosov 1960 ; salpeter 1961 ) , coulomb interactions modify the thermodynamical properties of the ion gas , in particular the specific heat .",
    "this , in turn , modifies the cooling times of white dwarfs , see eq .",
    "( [ eqcool ] ) .",
    "the strength of coulomb interactions  relative to the thermal kinetic energy  is determined by the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the inter - ionic separation and @xmath135 is the boltzmann constant . for small values of @xmath136 ,",
    "coulomb forces are of minor importance ( relative to thermal motions ) and the ions behave like an ideal non - interacting gas .",
    "but , once @xmath136 becomes of order unity , ions begin to undergo short - range correlations , eventually behaving like a liquid . for large enough @xmath136 ( @xmath137 )",
    "they form a lattice structure , experiencing a first order phase transition with the corresponding release of latent heat .",
    "this results in a new source of energy , which introduces an extra delay in the cooling of white dwarfs . in the case of coulomb plasmas ,",
    "the latent heat is small , of the order of @xmath138 per ion , where @xmath139 is the temperature of solidification .",
    "its contribution to the total luminosity is small , @xmath140% , but not negligible ( shaviv & kovetz 1976 ) .",
    "in addition , there is an increase in the specific heat of ions in the crystallized region ( according to the dulong - petit law ) due to the extra degree of freedom associated with lattice vibration .",
    "but most importantly , as the white dwarf cools further , fewer modes of the lattice are excited , and the heat capacity drops according to the debye law .",
    "this reduced heat capacity starts to manifest once the temperature drops below the debye temperature ( @xmath141 ) , resulting in a fast cooling phase ( @xmath142 ) once @xmath143 . as a result",
    ", the thermal content of the white dwarf gets smaller .",
    "this fast cooling is expected to take place in very cool white dwarfs , that is , those characterized by very low surface luminosities .",
    "we can estimate the importance of the debye cooling for white dwarfs as follows . from eq .",
    "( [ eqcool ] ) , and approximating the specific heat of ions in the debye regime by @xmath144 , to a first approximation we obtain :    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is the initial temperature from which debye cooling begins ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath148 .",
    "the integration yields the cooling time during the debye phase    @xmath149\\ \\frac{tm}{l}\\ \\frac{\\re}{a}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the cooling time during the debye phase is shorter than the result obtained from mestels law ( given by the last factor ) when @xmath150 is smaller than about @xmath151 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath152 then @xmath153 is a factor of 4 smaller than that obtained using mestel s law .",
    "it was hoped that this reduction in the cooling times would explain the deficit of observed white dwarfs below @xmath154 .",
    "however , it is difficult to attribute to the onset of debye cooling the deficiency of white dwarfs observed at low luminosities .",
    "this can be easily shown computing , for a given white dwarf mass , the luminosity at which debye cooling becomes relevant using again the relation between the luminosity and the central temperature , and adopting the central temperature corresponding to the onset of rapid debye cooling ( of about @xmath155 , as we have just shown ) .",

    "the stability analysis of crsico et al .",
    "( 2009c ) provides very strong support to the idea that the physical origin of the short periodicities of   could be the @xmath178-mechanism powered by the active he - burning shell , whereas the long - period branch of the period spectrum of this star should be due to the @xmath66-mechanism acting on the region of partial ionization of carbon and oxygen .",
    "if true , this could be indicating that  should have a thick he - rich envelope able to support stable he - shell burning .",
    "however , the real existence of the short periods of  must be confirmed by follow - up observations .",
    "if this were done , this star could be the first known pulsating pg 1159 star undergoing non - radial @xmath170-modes destabilized by the @xmath178-mechanism .",
    "even more ,  could be the first known pulsating star in which both the @xmath66-mechanism and the @xmath178-mechanism of mode driving are operating simultaneously .",
    "there are several reasons that make white dwarfs reliable cosmic clocks and laboratories to study different kind of problems .",
    "indeed , they constitute the final evolutionary stage for the vast majority of stars .",
    "they are a homogeneous class of stars with a narrow mass distribution and well known structure with slow rotation rates and low magnetic fields . and",
    "most importantly , their evolution , as we have shown , is relatively simple and can be described in terms of a cooling problem .",
    "additionally , their pulsational properties can be well described , and the excellent observational data gathered over the years provide strong constraints to the theory , allowing to refine the theoretical models . however , there are still some open questions regarding the evolutionary history of white dwarf progenitors , the physics of white dwarf cooling and their pulsational properties that still need to be addressed .",
    "once this is done , white dwarfs will constitute the best studied class of stars and will allow the astronomical community to use them as tracers of the evolution of the galaxy .",

    "<S> white dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars , including our sun . </S>",
    "<S> since the coolest white dwarfs are very old objects , the present population of white dwarfs contains a wealth of information on the evolution of stars from birth to death , and on the star formation rate throughout the history of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the study of white dwarfs has potential applications to different fields of astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , white dwarfs can be used as independent reliable cosmic clocks , and can also provide valuable information about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar populations , like our galaxy and open and globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the high densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these stars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme conditions that can not be achieved in terrestrial laboratories . </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , since many white dwarf stars undergo pulsational instabilities , the study of their properties constitutes a powerful tool for applications beyond stellar astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , white dwarfs can be used to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions and neutrinos , and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental constants .    </S>",
    "<S> these potential applications of white dwarfs have led to a renewed interest in the calculation of very detailed evolutionary and pulsational models for these stars . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> we enumerate the reasons that make these stars excellent chronometers and we describe why white dwarfs provide tools for a wide variety of applications . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation of white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes responsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution . moreover , in the course of their lives , white dwarfs cross different pulsational instability strips . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these instability strips provides astronomers with an unique opportunity to peer into their internal structure that would otherwise remain hidden from observers . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this allows to measure with unprecedented precision the stellar masses and to infer their envelope thicknesses , to probe the core chemical stratification , and to detect rotation rates and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in this work , we also review the pulsational properties of white dwarfs and the most recent applications of white dwarf asteroseismology . </S>"
