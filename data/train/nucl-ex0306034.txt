    "resonance particles , which have very short lifetime ( few fm / c ) comparable to the time scale for the evolution of the hot - dense matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , can be a very unique tool to probe the dynamics and properties of the high density matter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath13(892 ) has a lifetime of @xmath144fm / c , and can be produced at the chemical freeze - out stage .",
    "the @xmath13 short lifetime makes it possible for the newly - formed @xmath13 to undergo a period of re - interaction in the hadronic gas phase",
    ". a portion of @xmath15 may decay before the kinetic freeze - out stage and their kaon and pion daughter particles might be re - scattered by other particles in the hadron gas .",

    "this regeneration effect can compensate for the rescattering effect .",
    "thus the measurement of @xmath13 yields and their centrality dependence in heavy - ion collisions can provide information to estimate the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - out in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",

    "pion particles can regenerate @xmath15 signals through @xmath16 .",
    "this regeneration channel can also interfere with the kaon and pion elastic scattering channel through @xmath17 .",
    "thus the @xmath15 meson may be modified not only due to this interference but also due to the kaon and pion initial phase space distributions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , dynamical interactions of the @xmath15 meson with the surrounding matter may also cause the modification of the @xmath15 mass , width and line shape  @xcite . even though the size of the system formed in pp collisions is smaller than in au+au collisions , interactions that may modify the @xmath15 resonance",
