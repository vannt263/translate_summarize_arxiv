    "@xcite announced the discovery of a substellar companion to @xmath0 draconis ( k2 iii , hd 137759 ) with a period of 536 days and a minimum mass for the companion of 8.9  @xmath3 .",
    "they used a stellar mass of 1.05 @xmath2 from @xcite , who compared the absolute visual magnitude and ( @xmath4 ) color from hipparcos data with theoretical isochrones from @xcite .",
    "however , frink et al .",
    "acknowledge that evolutionary tracks for a range of masses are close together on the h - r diagram , so any slight change in the evolutionary model can have a large impact on the derived mass .",
    "* hereafter z08 ) observed @xmath0 dra in search of stellar oscillations using three separate instruments over almost 8 years in order to refine the orbital parameters of the planet and determine the mass of the central star .",
    "they found low amplitude , solar - like oscillations with a frequency of 3.8 d@xmath5 in two of the datasets and derived a stellar mass of 2.2 @xmath2 using the equations @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the oscillation velocity amplitude , @xmath9 is the frequency of the strongest mode , and @xmath10 is the effective temperature .",
    "they used a luminosity of 64.2@xmath12.1 @xmath11 from the hipparcos catalog and @xmath10 = 4490  k from @xcite .",
    "z08 then compared their 2.2 @xmath2 value to those derived using @xmath10 , surface gravities ( log @xmath12 ) , and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) from the literature and the param stellar model by @xcite and @xcite1.0 . ] .",
    "the masses ranged from 1.05@xmath10.36 @xmath2 based on values from @xcite to 1.71@xmath10.38 @xmath2 based on values from @xcite .",
    "because z08 s mass was significantly higher than those derived using the model , they chose a mass of 1.4 @xmath2 to calculate the minimum mass of the companion , which they list as 10.3 @xmath3 .    a more accurate way to estimate the star s mass would be to investigate the frequency splitting ( @xmath13 ) using the equation @xmath14 combined with an interferometrically measured radius , but unfortunately z08 s dataset was not suitable for measuring @xmath13 .",
    "the advantage interferometry brings is the ability to directly measure the angular diameter of the star .",
    "then the physical radius can be determined using the distance from the parallax , and @xmath10 can be calculated .",
    "we combine our results with those from stellar oscillation frequencies to more completely understand the system through a description of the central star s and exoplanet s masses and the extent of the habitable zone .",
    "section 2 details our observing procedure , section 3 discusses how @xmath0 dra s angular diameter and @xmath10 were determined , and section 4 explores the physical implications of the new measurements .",
    "observations were obtained using the chara array , a six element y - shaped optical - infrared interferometer located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "we used the chara classic and climb beam combiners in the @xmath15-band ( 2.13  @xmath16 m ) while visible wavelengths ( 470 - 800 nm ) were used for tracking and tip / tilt corrections . the observing procedure and data reduction process employed here",
    "are described in @xcite .",
    "we observed @xmath0 dra over four nights spanning four years with two baselines : in 2007 and 2008 , we used the longest telescope pair s1-e1 with a maximum baseline of 331 m and in 2011 , we used a shorter telescope pair w1-w2 with a maximum baseline of 108 m.    chosing proper calibrator stars is vital because they act as the standard against which the scientific target is measured .",
    "we selected four calibrators ( hd 128998 , hd 139778 , hd 141472 , and hd 145454 ) because they are single stars with expected visibility amplitudes @xmath1780@xmath18",
    "so they were very nearly unresolved on the baseline used .",
    "this meant uncertainties in the calibrators diameters did not affect the target s diameter calculation as much as if the calibrator stars had a significant angular size on the sky .",
    "we interleaved calibrator and target star observations so that every target was flanked by calibrator observations made as close in time as possible , which allowed us to convert instrumental target and calibrator visibilities to calibrated visibilities for the target .    to check for possible unseen close companions that would contaminate our observations , we created spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "fits based on published @xmath19 photometric values obtained from the literature for each calibrator to establish diameter estimates .",
    "we combined the photometry with kurucz model atmospheres based on @xmath10 and log  @xmath12 values to calculate angular diameters for the calibrators .",
    "the stellar models were fit to observed photometry after converting magnitudes to fluxes using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath20 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath21 ) .",
    "the photometry , @xmath10 and log  @xmath12 values , and resulting angular diameters for the calibrators are listed in table [ calibrators ] .",
    "there were no hints of excess emission associated with a low - mass stellar companion or circumstellar disk in the calibrators sed fits ( see figure [ seds ] ) .",
    "the observed quantity of an interferometer is defined as the visibility ( @xmath22 ) , which is fit with a model of a uniformly - illuminated disk ( ud ) that represents the observed face of the star .",
    "diameter fits to @xmath22 were based upon the ud approximation given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the first - order bessel function and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the projected baseline at the star s position , @xmath27 is the apparent ud angular diameter of the star , and @xmath28 is the effective wavelength of the observation @xcite .",
    "table [ calib_visy ] lists the modified julian date ( mjd ) , projected baseline at the time of observation ( @xmath26 ) , projected baseline position angle ( @xmath29 ) , calibrated visibility ( @xmath22 ) , and error in @xmath22 ( @xmath30 ) for @xmath0 dra .",
    "figure [ vvsb_ud ] shows the ud fit to the observed visibilities and it is clear that this is not a sufficient model .",
    "a more realistic model of a star s disk involves limb - darkening ( ld ) , particularly in this case because most of the observations are on the third lobe of the visibility curve where secondary effects such as limb darkening play a more important role than in the curve between @xmath26=0 and the first null .",
    "@xcite analyzed multiple ld prescriptions for the k1.5 iii star arcturus and found the power law model to be a sufficient approximation .",
    "we chose to use this model because arcturus spectral type is very close to that of @xmath0 dra .",
    "the model was based on @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the brightness of a point source at wavelength @xmath28 , @xmath33(1 ) is the brightness at the center , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the angular distance from the star s center , and @xmath36 is the limb - darkened angular diameter . in terms of the star s visibilities ,",
    "the power law prescription becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radial spatial frequency , @xmath39 is the euler function ( @xmath40 + 1 ) = @xmath41 ! ) , @xmath42 @xcite , and @xmath41 is the number of terms used .",
    "we tried a range of @xmath41 values to check its effect on @xmath36 and found that after 10 terms , @xmath36 remained steady .",
    "therefore we used @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting ud and ld angular diameters and their errors ( @xmath44 ) are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    "additionally , the combination of the interferometric measurement of the star s angular diameter plus the _ hipparcos _ parallax @xcite allowed us to determine the star s physical radius , which is also listed in table [ parameters ] .    for the @xmath36 fit , the errors were derived via the reduced @xmath45 minimization method @xcite : the diameter fit with the lowest @xmath45 was found and the corresponding diameter was the final @xmath36 for the star .",
    "the errors were calculated by finding the diameter at @xmath46 on either side of the minimum @xmath45 and determining the difference between the @xmath45 diameter and @xmath47 diameter .",
    "figure [ vvsb ] shows the ld diameter fit for @xmath0 dra .",
    "once @xmath36 was determined interferometrically , the @xmath10 was calculated using the relation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bolometric flux and @xmath50 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath49 was determined in the following way : @xmath0 dra s",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath51 magnitudes were dereddened using the extinction curve described in @xcite and its interstellar absorption ( @xmath52 ) value was from @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic broad - band color ( @xmath53 ) was calculated and the bolometric correction ( bc ) was determined by interpolating between the [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and + 0.2 tables from @xcite .",
    "they point out that in the range of 6000 k @xmath54 4000 k , their bc calibration is symmetrically distributed around a @xmath10.10 magnitude band when compared to other calibrations , so we assigned the bc an error of 0.10 . the bolometric flux ( @xmath49 )",
    "was then determined by applying the bc and the @xmath10 was calculated .",
    "the star s luminosity ( @xmath55 ) was also calculated using the absolute @xmath22 magnitude and the bc .",
    "see table [ parameters ] for a summary of these parameters .",
    "we estimated the limb - darkened angular diameter for @xmath0 dra using two additional methods as a check for our measurement .",
    "first , we created an sed fit for the star as described in section 2 , where @xmath56 photometry was from @xcite , @xmath57 photometry was from @xcite , and @xmath21 photometry was from @xcite .",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the resulting fit .",
    "second , we used the relationship described in @xcite between the ( @xmath53 ) color , @xmath10 , and @xmath58 .",
    "our measured @xmath36 is 3.596@xmath10.015 mas , the sed fit estimates 3.81@xmath10.23 mas , and the color - temperature - diameter relationship produces 3.63@xmath10.53 mas . because @xmath0 dra is so bright in the @xmath51-band ( 0.7 mag ) and because 2mass measurements saturate at magnitudes brighter than @xmath593.5 even when using the shortest exposure time , we used the @xmath51 magnitude from the two - micron sky survey @xcite for the color - diameter determination .",
    "the main sources of errors for the three methods are uncertainties in visibilities for the interferometric measurement , uncertainties in the comparison between observed fluxes and the model fluxes for a given @xmath10 and log  @xmath12 for the sed estimate , and uncertainties in the parameters of the relation and the spread of stars around that relation for the color - temperature - diameter determination .",
    "all three diameters agree within their errors but our interferometric measurements provide an error approximately 15 and 35 times smaller than the other methods , respectively .    with our newly calculated @xmath10 , we were able to estimate the mass of the central star using equations 1 and 2 and obtained a mass of 1.82@xmath600.23 @xmath2 .",
    "we then calculated the exoplanet s minimum mass using the orbital parameters presented in @xcite and the equation @xmath61 where the period @xmath62 was 510.72@xmath10.07 days , the amplitude @xmath51 was 306.0@xmath13.8 m / s , and the eccentricity @xmath63 was 0.713@xmath10.008 .",
    "our calculation produced a minimum mass of 12.6@xmath11.1 @xmath3 , which converged in two iterations .",
    "our @xmath10 of 4545@xmath1110 k is within the range listed in z08 , which spans 4466@xmath1100 k @xcite to 4775@xmath1113 k @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar mass derived here is lower than that calculated in z08 ( 2.2 @xmath2 ) and slightly higher than the range presented in their paper ( 1.2 - 1.7 @xmath2 ) , though it overlaps within errors with the mass derived from the @xmath10 and log  @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "hopefully future observations of this star will determine the frequency splitting ( see equation 3 ) , which will allow for the direct measurement of the star s mass when combined with the interferometrically measured radius .",
    "using the following equations from @xcite , we were also able to calculate the size of the system s habitable zone : @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66(@xmath10 ) and @xmath67(@xmath10 ) are the critical fluxes at the inner and outer boundaries in units of the solar constant .",
    "the inner and outer physical boundaries @xmath68 in au were then calculated using @xmath69      the chara array is funded by the national science foundation through nsf grant ast-0606958 and by georgia state university through the college of arts and sciences , and by the w.m . keck foundation .",
