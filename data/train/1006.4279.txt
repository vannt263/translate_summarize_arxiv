    "the observation , made by kim and chan in 2004 , of a non classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) in a torsional oscillator ( to ) containing solid helium@xcite has generated , in the last years , a huge interest in the debate about supersolidity .",
    "the first theoretical speculations about the supersolid phase , i.e. a phase where crystalline order coexists with superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , date back almost forty years@xcite . nevertheless , we are still far from a complete description of this phenomenon .",
    "the evidences of ncri in solid helium have been confirmed in several to experiments performed by other groups@xcite , which often gave controversial results .",
    "nowadays , there is an overall agreement of all the data concerning the onset temperature of this phenomenon ( @xmath5 ) , but the values of the superfluid density @xmath6 reported so far can vary more than one order of magnitude , according to experimental conditions such as the way the crystal is prepared , its subsequent annealing or the @xmath7he concentration@xcite .",
    "these discrepancies suggest that the quality of the solid sample plays a very important role in these experiments .",
    "so , it is very important to understand the behavior of crystalline defects and to study if they are necessary to have superfluidity in a crystal and if they can be stable in the ground state of this system .    from the theoretical point of view , the presence of bec in a crystal can be detected by computing the momentum distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state , in strongly interacting system like @xmath1he , appears in @xmath8 as a delta - peak for @xmath9 and a divergent behavior @xmath10 when @xmath4 .",
    "equivalently , one can get information about the bec properties of a quantum system from the asymptotic behavior of the one - body density matrix @xmath11 , which is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath8 . if at large distances @xmath12 reaches a plateau the system present off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) , the condensate fraction @xmath13 being this asymptotic value @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical study of solid @xmath1he at low temperatures can not be developed analytically via a perturbative approach .",
    "it is therefore necessary the use of microscopic approaches to provide a reliable description of this phenomenon .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have been extensively used for this purpose , but , so far , they have not been able to reproduce the experimental findings on supersolid @xmath1he .",
    "path integral monte carlo simulations ( pimc ) results have shown that a commensurate perfect crystal does not exhibit either superfluid fraction@xcite or odlro@xcite . instead , a non - zero condensate fraction has been observed in simulations of crystals presenting defects , such as vacancies@xcite or grain boundaries@xcite , and in simulations of an amorphous state of the solid@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these simulations are not able to provide results in complete agreement with the experimental ones and therefore does not bring to a definitive answer of the supersolidity problem .    in this paper , we perform pimc calculations of the one - body density matrix and of the momentum distribution in solid @xmath1he by means of a very accurate sampling scheme .",
    "we will study commensurate and incommensurate hcp crystals , both at zero and finite temperature . in section [ pimc ]",
    ", we describe the methods used in our simulations . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present the results obtained , at first , for perfect hcp crystals at different densities , and subsequently , for hcp crystals presenting vacancies . finally , our conclusions are comprised in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method provides a fundamental approach in the study of strongly interacting quantum system at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the partition function @xmath15 allows for a full microscopic description of the properties of a given system with hamiltonian @xmath16 at a temperature @xmath17 ( the complete basis we use is the position basis @xmath18 where the @xmath19 particles are labeled ) .",
    "the noncommutativity of the kinetic and the potential energy operators ( respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) makes impractical a direct calculation of @xmath22 from eq .",
    "[ partitionfunction ] .",
    "the basic idea of pimc is to use the convolution property of the thermal density matrix @xmath23 , in order to rewrite the partition function as @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the boundary condition @xmath26 . for sufficiently large @xmath27",
    ", we recover the high - temperature limit for the thermal density matrix , where it is easy to separate the kinetic contribution from the potential one ( primitive approximation ) . if one ignores the quantum statistics of the particles , the distribution law appearing in eq .",
    "[ convolution ] is positive definite and can be interpreted as a probability distribution function which can be sampled by standard metropolis monte carlo methods .    in practice ,",
    "the pimc method consists in mapping the finite - temperature quantum system to a classical system made up of closed ring polymers .",
    "this technique may be referred as an `` exact '' method , in the sense that using an accurate approximation for the high - temperature density matrices , the results are not affected by this approximation within the statistical error . however , its disadvantage is that the number @xmath27 of convolution terms ( beads ) necessary to reach the convergence of eq .",
    "[ convolution ] to the exact value of @xmath22 is inversely proportional to the temperature of the system : this means that , when approaching the interesting quantum regime at very low temperature , @xmath27 increases fast making simulations hard , if not impossible , due to the very low efficiency in the sampling of the long chains involved .    to overcome this problem , it is important to develop high - order approximation schemes for the density matrix , able to work with larger values of @xmath28 .",
    "the approximation we use in this work is called chin approximation ( ca)@xcite .",
    "ca is based on a fourth order expansion of the @xmath29 which makes use of the double commutator @xmath30,\\hat{v}]$ ] , this term being related to the gradient of the interatomic potential . with respect to takahashi - imada approximation@xcite , which is accurate to fourth order only for the trace , the new feature appearing in the ca is the presence of coefficients weighting the different terms in the expansion of the action : these coefficients are continuously tunable , making possible to force the error terms of fourth order to roughly cancel each other and get an effective sixth - order approximation .",
    "an additional problem we have to deal with when simulating quantum many - body systems with pimc arises from the indistinguishable nature of the particles .",
    "if we deal with bosons like @xmath1he , the indistinguishability of particles does not change the positivity of the probability distribution in eq .",
    "[ convolution ] and the symmetry of @xmath31 can be recovered via the direct sampling of permutations between the ring polymers representing the quantum particles . to this purpose",
    ", a very efficient sampling is performed by the worm algorithm ( wa)@xcite : the basic idea of this technique is to work in an extended configuration space , given by the union of the ensemble @xmath22 , formed by the usual closed - ring configurations , and the ensemble @xmath32 , which is made up of configurations where all the polymers but one are closed . thanks to the presence of an open polymer , we are able to search the atoms involved in a permutation cycle by means of single particle updates , which do not suffer of a low acceptance rate and guarantee an efficient and ergodic sampling of the bosonic permutations .",
    "we have to notice that the probability distribution used to sample the configurations in @xmath32 is not equal to the one appearing in eq . [ convolution ] and ,",
    "therefore , these configurations can not be used to calculate diagonal properties , such as the energy or the superfluid density .",
    "however , the @xmath32-configurations can be used to compute off - diagonal observables such as the one - body density matrix @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the wa being able to sample both diagonal and off - diagonal configuration , is able to give an estimation of the normalization factor of @xmath33 .",
    "in this way , we are able to compute the properly normalized one - body density matrix and so to avoid the systematical uncertainties introduced by a posteriori normalization factor .",
    "the pimc technique can be extended to zero temperature , in the so called path integral ground state ( pigs ) method@xcite .",
    "indeed , we can see that the same imaginary - time evolution operator appearing in the definition of the thermal density matrix , can be used to project a trial wave function @xmath34 to the exact ground - state wave function @xmath35 according to the formula @xmath36 as in the finite temperature approach , one can compute the ground - state averages of physical observables by factorizing @xmath31 and studying the convergence with the number @xmath27 of convolution terms . a good approximation for @xmath37 at small @xmath28 , like ca , makes possible to choose @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ pigs_wf ] and thus to obtain exact and completely model - independent results still with a very small number of beads @xmath27@xcite .",
    "we have carried out pimc simulations of solid @xmath1he using a perfect hcp lattice with a simulation box containing @xmath39 atoms interacting with an aziz pair potential@xcite . at first , we perform calculations for a solid at a density @xmath40 , at three different temperatures . the results for @xmath12 and @xmath0 are shown in figure [ rho1nk0491sigma-3 ] .",
    "we can see that , at large @xmath41 , @xmath12 decays exponentially , indicating that this system does not present odlro .",
    "we can also see that there is not a dependence of the momentum distribution with the temperature , in agreement with previous results by clark and ceperley@xcite .",

    "in the impulse approximation , which describe well the inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfer , @xmath46 and @xmath0 are related by the formula@xcite @xmath49 being @xmath50 .    in figure [ longitudinaldistribution ] , we compare the results for the longitudinal momentum distribution obtained from our @xmath0 at zero temperature with the fit obtained from experimental measurement by diallo _",

    "the difference between our momentum distribution and the one computed by ceperley has to be attributed to the larger density of the crystal we are simulating , and indicates that a larger coordination between the atoms in the solid cause a depletion of the low momentum states .    :",

    "figure [ rho1nk056sigma-3 ] shows @xmath12 and @xmath0 in a crystal at the density @xmath57 . for this density ,",
    "the solid phase is stable over a larger range of temperature , making us able to simulate the system at temperatures up to @xmath58 . comparing the results for the two different densities , we see that , when @xmath59 increases , the one - body density matrix decays faster to zero and that the occupation of the low momentum states is appreciably decreased .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that @xmath12 and @xmath0 are nearly independent of @xmath2 even for temperatures larger than @xmath60 , that is the superfluid transition temperature in the liquid phase .",
    "it is important to notice that at both densities , the shape of @xmath0 differs significantly from the classical gaussian maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this feature is clearly shown in figure [ comparegaussian ] , where we plot , on a logarithmic scale , @xmath0 as a function of @xmath61 . from this graph , it is easy to see the differences between the momentum distributions we obtained from pimc and the straight line which represent a gaussian distribution .",
