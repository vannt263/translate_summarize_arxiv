    "the search for the first galaxies remains one of the primary goals of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "surveys of distant star forming galaxies ( e.g. lyman break galaxies ; lbgs ) have resulted in determinations of luminosity functions , stellar masses , and ages of objects to @xmath9 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the space density of galaxies at @xmath10 and their apparent maturity suggests that galaxy formation must have begun at @xmath11 .",
    "although the requirement of deep near - infrared imaging makes @xmath3 difficult to observe , this is a critical epoch in the history of galaxy formation .",
    "discovery of the first galaxy - wide bursts of star formation  the first genuine protogalaxies  is essential to understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "pencil beam surveys have searched for @xmath12 galaxies . in the deepest available near - infrared data  the hubble deep fields north and south ( hdf - n and -s )",
    ", the ultra deep field ( udf ) and the udf parallel fields@xcite find three possible @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "in addition , observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies have also revealed a few potential @xmath12 galaxies ( richard et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "however , these deep , small area surveys find faint candidates which are difficult to follow up , so none of the redshifts have been confirmed by measuring their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at longer wavelengths .",
    "this crucial test has ruled out other @xmath13 candidates @xcite , including the one first presented in @xcite .",
    "our nicmos parallel imaging survey has the unique combination of sensitivity and area to find rare , luminous j - dropout lbgs at @xmath14 .",
    "these candidates are typically @xmath2  = 23 - 25 ( ab ) , so follow - up observations can confirm or rule out extremely high redshifts . in particular , these galaxies can be observed with irac on _ spitzer space telescope _ ( hereafter _ spitzer _ ) .",
    "we present here the first results of such a survey , where one possible @xmath5 galaxy has been discovered .",
    "we use @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , and ab magnitudes are also used throughout .",
    "we selected j - dropout candidates from the nicmos parallel imaging survey ( @xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we have adjusted the photometry by -0.16 and -0.04 mag in @xmath1  and @xmath2 according to de jong ( 2006 ) . from more than seven thousand",
    "detected sources , four targets were selected from the small subset ( 2% ) with red @xmath1  - @xmath2  ( @xmath20 ) and no @xmath1  detection above @xmath21 .",
    "we observed these nicmos selected j - dropout candidates for four , five or six orbits each with nicmos in the @xmath1  -band to confirm their red @xmath1  - @xmath2  color .",
    "the images were drizzled according to @xcite , and the resulting point - spread function has a fwhm@xmath22 .",
    "the 5 @xmath23 sensitivity , measured in a 0.8  diameter aperture is @xmath1  = 26.3- 26.5 .",
    "the nicmos colors were measured in apertures of this size .",
    "these four galaxies were also observed with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on _ spitzer _ , at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 .",
    "the integration times were 0.9 ks pixel@xmath24 at 3.6 and 5.8 , and 2.8 ks pixel@xmath24 at 4.5 and 8.0 .",
    "we used the _ spitzer _",
    "science center mosaicking software , mopex , with the drizzle algorithm to combine the images from the basic calibrated data set .",
    "the output pixel size is 0.6 , and resulting fwhm of the point - spread - function is 1.8  in the 3.6 and 4.5  bands , 2.0  in the 5.8  band , and 2.2  in the 8.0  band .",
    "the noise was measured by placing apertures in blank parts of the images .",
    "we chose a 2.4  diameter aperture to avoid contamination from nearby sources .",
    "for this small aperture , the corrections are 1.8 , 1.9 , 2.4 , and 2.7 in the four irac bands ( derived from point sources in our fields ) .",
    "the resulting 3 @xmath23 sensitivities are 0.8 , 0.8 , 5.8 , and 3.8 @xmath25jy ( total ) .",
    "the resulting photometry shows that three of the four sources have seds which are consistent with lower - z interlopers .",
    "one has @xmath1  - @xmath2  = 0.4 , and it too blue to be a viable @xmath26 candidate .",
    "two other sources have rising seds into the irac bands , with @xmath2  - [ 3.6 ] = 2 - 3 .",
    "this makes them likely lower redshift interlopers , such as dusty starburst galaxies at @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the most remarkable source , however , is jd2325 + 1433  which has @xmath1  -@xmath2  = 1.7 , and a spectrum which is flat ( in @xmath28 ) through 3.6 and 4.5  ( much bluer than the controversial @xmath29 j - dropout candidate reported by @xcite ) .",
    "these are the colors that are expected for lbgs at @xmath30 .",
    "initially , jd2325 + 1433  was only detected at 4.5  ( @xmath31jy ) , even though the 3.6 and 4.5  images reach the same sensitivity .",
    "since this could be evidence for a balmer break at a redshift of @xmath0 , we obtained deep ( 10 hour ) _ spitzer _ directors discretionary time ( ddt ) observations at 3.6 and 5.8   to verify the break .",
    "the data are reduced in the same manner as described above , and the 3 @xmath23 sensitivity is 0.23 and 2.0 @xmath25jy at 3.6 and 5.8 .",
    "the candidate , jd2325 + 1433  is detected at 3.6 , with @xmath32jy , confirming this break between 3.6  and 4.5 .",
    "we do not detect jd2325 + 1433  at 5.8 , which is consistent with its flat spectrum .",
    "postage stamp images of jd2325 + 1433  in figure [ stamps ] show another galaxy approximately 2.5to the east . to test whether there is significant contamination from this source",
    ", we performed a psf subtraction to remove it .",
    "this assumes that the nearby source is unresolved the irac images , which is consistent with its nicmos size ( fwhm@xmath33 ) and the observed irac fwhm ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we then re - measure jd2325 + 1433  with the nearby source removed .",
    "the resulting flux density is @xmath35jy at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that at most 2 - 3% of the light from a point source at the position of the nearby source would fall in the aperture that we used for jd2325 + 1433 a fraction that corresponds to at most 0.05 @xmath25jy .    as an independent check",
    ", we used sextractor @xcite to deblend the two sources .",
    "the resulting photometry , using the same 2.4  diameter aperture , is consistent with aperture photometry when no correction for blending is made@xmath36jy at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that contamination is negligible , and make no correction to the aperture photometry .",
    "we do , however , include the scatter derived from these three measurements in our irac error estimates , although it is only appreciable for the 3.6  photometry ( 0.04 @xmath25jy , added in quadrature with 0.08 @xmath25jy ) .      to facilitate comparison with irac",
    ", we must estimate an aperture correction to account for missed flux in the nicmos images .",
    "although jd2325 + 1433  does not have the s / n required to characterize its morphology , we can place rough constraints on its size .",
    "we use galfit @xcite to derive sizes and axial ratios for a few different assumed light profiles . for an exponential disk model",
    ", we find @xmath37  and @xmath38 , and for a gaussian we find a fwhm @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we also attempted to fit a de vaucouleurs profile , but it was unconstrained .",
    "the uncertainties on these fits define the largest and smallest galaxy sizes , and therefore the largest and smallest aperture corrections that we can expect . to account for a possible de vaucouleurs light profile , we add 0.15 magnitudes of missed flux to the largest exponential disk aperture correction as found by @xcite .",
    "we choose an aperture correction in the center of this range , and 1@xmath23 uncertainties to span the entire range .",
    "for a 0.9  diameter aperture , this aperture correction is @xmath41 .",
    "we find that this aperture size minimizes the uncertainty on the total nicmos flux density , which includes uncertainties for both the background and the aperture correction .",
    "we apply this aperture correction to @xmath1  and @xmath2 , since the psf is approximately the same for both .",
    "finally , the _ total _ flux densities are : ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] ) = ( 0.11 , 0.50 , 0.75 , 1.29 ) @xmath42 ( 0.03 , 0.09 , 0.09 , 0.29 ) @xmath25jy . the 3@xmath23 upper limits at 5.8 and 8.0  are 2.0 and 3.8 @xmath25jy .      a stellar or substellar contaminant for jd2325 + 1433  is improbable , for a several reasons .",
    "first , the source is likely resolved . in ",
    "[ matching ] we show that the semi - major axis has a fwhm @xmath43 0.5 , while the nicmos psf has a fwhm of @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the nicmos images in figure [ stamps ] show that jd2325 + 1433  is elongated in the same direction in both the @xmath1  and @xmath2   images .",
    "even if jd2325 + 1433  were unresolved , its photometry can not be fit by a stellar contaminant .",
    "of particular concern are brown dwarfs , which have molecular features that can imitate spectral breaks .",
    "while the reddest l - dwarfs can fit our nicmos color , they can not simultaneously fit our irac photometry ( typically [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] @xmath45 ) .",
    "similarly , t - dwarfs can fit our irac photometry with [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] @xmath46 ( ab ) , but with j - h @xmath47 , they are much too blue to fit our nicmos observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this trend in the colors of late - type t - dwarfs is predicted to extend to the coolest dwarfs ( @xcite ; barman , priv .",
    "lastly , we note that other young stellar objects such as t - tauri stars can not produce this red @xmath1  - @xmath2  color ( e.g. @xcite ) , as their nir colors are dominated by photospheric emission .",
    "we use the _ hyperz _ photometric redshift code @xcite with @xcite stellar snythesis templates to estimate the redshift of jd2325 + 1433 . we do not include the 5.8  limit , as no reasonable models predict a flux @xmath48jy at 5.8 . assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and using the padova 1994 evolutionary tracks",
    ", we fit for redshift , varying age , mass normalization , extinction ( @xmath49 ; @xcite law ) , and metallicity ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we also allow three different star formation histories an instantaneous burst , a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) , and an exponentially declining sfr with an e - folding time of 100 myrs . with four data points ,",
    "the problem is underconstrained , and we are not able to estimate metallicity or star formation history .",
    "however , we include these parameters so that we do not overlook some combination of parameters that is a good fit to our data at lower redshift ( @xmath27 ) .    in figure [ fits ] we compare the best fit model ( black curve ) , which has @xmath51 , to the best possible fit that can be achieved for @xmath52 ( grey )",
    ". this lower - z fit , which has @xmath53 , is significantly poorer , and can not reproduce the two breaks in the spectrum . to further test the significance of these fits",
    ", we generated @xmath54 monte carlo realizations of the photometry , simultaneously varying the fluxes according to the measured uncertainties .",
    "we fit these data with _ hyperz _",
    ", as described above .",
    "the probability distribution in redshift space ( see figure [ fits ] , right ) , shows a peak at @xmath51 and a much smaller peak at @xmath55 .",
    "more than 96% of solutions lie at @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed 4.5  flux density lying only 1.7@xmath23 away from the @xmath56 model .",
    "for normally distributed uncertainties , the true 4.5  flux density will lie more than 1.7@xmath23 away from our measurement 10% of the time .",
    "this implies that there is a 5% chance that the balmer break is more than 1.7 @xmath23 larger than we have estimated , and 5% chance that there is no balmer break at all . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath7 models will be a good fit to the photometry .    in figure [ contours ]",
    "we show two dimensional confidence intervals in age / redshift space , and extinction / age . estimated 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath23 contours are determined from the probability at which 68.3% ( 95.4% , 99.7% ) of the monte carlo realizations have a higher likelihood . in the left panel",
    "we show that the @xmath0 solution is preferred at the 1 @xmath23 level , while the 2 @xmath23 interval includes some @xmath55 solutions .",
    "both panels show that the age of jd2325 + 1433  is not well constrained , with values ranging from a few myrs , to several hundred myrs .",
    "the right panel shows a degeneracy between age and extinction .",
    "if we exclude models with ages less than 10 myrs ( since it is unlikely that all the stars in the galaxy can form within 10 myrs ) , then we can also constrain the extinction to @xmath57 .",
    "lastly , we note that estimated stellar masses range from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , for a salpeter imf .",
    "if jd2325 + 1433  is at @xmath0 , its uv luminosity corresponds to @xmath60 , and we can estimate a lower limit on the volume density of luminous @xmath61 lbgs . for this redshift range , the entire nicmos parallel survey covers @xmath62 ( comoving ) to @xmath2  = 24 . beyond this , we are limited by @xmath1  - band sensitivity required to select sources with @xmath1  - @xmath2  @xmath63 , as described in  [ targets ] . at fainter magnitudes ( given the large inhomogeneity in pure parallel exposure times ) ,",
    "51% of the total survey area has sufficient sensitivity to find galaxies like jd2325 + 1433 .",
    "this implies that we have searched @xmath64 ( comoving ) , and the resulting volume density of @xmath65 lbgs is @xmath4 .",
    "the volume density implied here is roughly consistent with that at @xmath6 , as measured by @xcite .",
    "this lf predicts @xmath66 for galaxies with @xmath67 , implying @xmath68 such sources in our survey volume ( assuming poisson errors ) . on the other hand , @xmath10 lf , as measured by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) , predicts fewer luminous galaxies and therefore significantly smaller number for this survey ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "if this @xmath10 lf is representative of @xmath0 lbgs , then jd2325 + 1433  is almost certainly an interloper at @xmath7 .",
    "however , this evolution in the lf is uncertain , and the @xmath70 lf measured by @xcite shows no change in the number density of luminous galaxies from @xmath6 . since the iwata et al .",
    "survey contains four times more area than the bouwens et al .",
    "survey , this measurement may be a more reliable probe of the most luminous sources .",
    "indirect evidence also implies that @xmath12 galaxies may be detectable in the nicmos pure parallel imaging . at @xmath71 ,",
    "the ages and masses of lbgs predict a more intense period of star formation at earlier times ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggesting upward luminosity evolution at @xmath72 .",
    "this argument is also made for faint ly@xmath73  emitting galaxies .",
    "if any of the six candidates reported by @xcite are indeed at @xmath26 , then the space density of faint ly@xmath73  emitters at this epoch must be larger than at @xmath74 ( as measured by @xcite ; @xcite ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the density of galaxies and the evolution of the lf at @xmath75 is sufficiently uncertain that the @xmath0 interpretation of jd2325 + 1433  can not be ruled out .",
    "constraining the numbers of galaxies at @xmath26 is crucial to understanding the transition from a neutral to ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "currently , it is unclear if star forming galaxies at @xmath10 are capable of reionizing the igm , largely in part due to uncertainties in the stellar imf ( e.g. @xcite ) , the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the gas clumping factor .",
    "if jd2325 + 1433  is indeed at @xmath0 , the relatively large number of uv - luminous galaxies at this redshift will likely relax the requirement for strong evolution in these parameters .",
    "finally , we note that further observations can resolve the degeneracy between the @xmath0 and @xmath7 interpretations .",
    "the blue @xmath2   - irac colors constrain the sed so that we can predict @xmath76 for the intermediate - z solutions . of the 4% of monte carlo realizations ( discussed in  [ hyperz ] ) that have @xmath77 , none are fainter than @xmath78 , so deep optical imaging can definitively confirm the redshift of jd2325 + 1433 .",
