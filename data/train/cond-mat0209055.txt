    "diluted ferromagnetic iii - v semiconductors are promising materials for applications as well as interesting from the physics point of view .",
    "they might allow the incorporation of ferromagnetic elements into semiconductor devices , and thus the integration of data processing and magnetic storage on a single chip .",
    "it is important to understand the interplay between transport properties , magnetic ordering , and the defect configuration , which is determined by the growth conditions .",
    "we show that correlated positions of defects are required for a description consistent with experiments @xcite .    to be specific , we consider gaas doped with manganese , but the results should apply for most iii - v compounds .",
    "the physics relies on the dual role played by the mn impurities : they carry a local spin due to the half - filled _ d_-shell and dope the system with holes , which mediate a ferromagnetic indirect exchange interaction between the spins .",
    "a crucial feature of these materials is their high degree of compensation , which is presumably due to antisite defects ( as substituted for ga ) .",
    "the accordingly small density of holes leads to weak electronic screening of the coulomb interaction between charged defects and between defects and holes .",
    "this role of compensation has not been taken into account previously . due to the strong coulomb interactions a random distribution of defects on the cation sublattice",
    "is very costly in energy .",
    "therefore , defect diffusion @xcite leads to a rearrangement of defects in such a way that the coulomb energy is reduced . we study this rearrangement with the help of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and",
    "find that strong correlations of defect positions develop .",
    "the resulting disorder potential acting on the valence - band holes is strongly reduced and most of its correlations fall off on the scale of the minimum defect separation . we show that this effect has tremendous consequences for transport properties , the integrity of the energy gap , and the temperature - dependent magnetisation . in fact , a description in agreement with experiments _ requires _ the defects to be strongly correlated .",
    "in this section , we study how diffusion of defects , _",
    "i.e. _ , mn impurities and antisites , changes the defect configuration and the disorder potential",
    ". this is motivated by experiments @xcite that show that defect diffusion is rather pronounced at typical growth and annealing temperatures of the order of @xmath0c .",
    "we start from a random distribution of mn impuritites and antisites ( as ) on the cation sublattice , where the density of antisites is determined by charge neutrality from the observed @xcite hole concentrations at given mn doping levels .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the defect charges and @xmath3 is their separation .",
    "relative to the cation sublattice , mn impurities carry charge @xmath4 whereas antisites carry @xmath5 .",
    "the screening length @xmath6 is obtained from nonlinear screening theory @xcite .",
    "it is much larger than the nearest - neighbor separation on the cation sublattice so that it hardly affects the small - scale defect correlations relevant here .",
    "we perform mc simulations for the hamiltonian @xmath7 @xcite employing the metropolis algorithm at the temperature @xmath0c for systems of @xmath8 conventional cubic unit cells with periodic boundary conditions , unless stated otherwise . to roughly model",
    "the dynamics , we only use local mc moves , _",
    "i.e. _ , exchanges of nearest - neighbor defect and/or host atoms",
    ". a more realistic modelling of the dynamics involving interstitials and vacancies lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the resulting configurations are quenched at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "this should be compared to the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig.conf0 ] , which shows an equilibrated configuration of the same number of defects .",
    "it is obvious that the defects have formed small clusters , where typically an antisites ( charge @xmath13 ) is surrounded by several mn impurities ( charge @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is clear that this clustering leads to a strongly reduced impurity potential , since the antisite charges are very effectively screened .",
    "potential correlation function @xmath15 for mn concentration @xmath10 and @xmath11 holes per mn , plotted for various numbers of mc steps . the heavy solid bar denotes the nearest - neighbor separation on the cation sublattice .",
    "the inset shows the initial rapid decrease of @xmath15 for the equilibrated case , see text.,width=415 ]    more quantitative information can be obtained from the potential correlation function @xmath16 obviously , @xmath17 is the width of the distribution of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath15 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.correl ] for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for various numbers of mc steps , which serve as a rough meassure of annealing time .",
    "defect diffusion strongly reduces @xmath15 and thus @xmath19 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig.correl ] shows a blowup of @xmath15 for the approximately equilibrated state .",
    "the initial reduction of @xmath15 to about 10% of @xmath20 on the scale of the nearest - neighbor separation of about @xmath21(heavy bar ) is due to the screening of the compensated 70% of mn impurities by antisites , leaving only 30% active .",
    "since @xmath15 contains the potential squared , this leads to a reduction to about 9% ( yellow region in the inset ) .",
    "the remaining contribution from uncompensated mn ( light blue region ) decays on the typical length scale of @xmath22associated with their density , which is @xmath23 per cation site .",
    "clearly , ionic screening , _ i.e. _ , screening by the defects , is nearly perfect at @xmath0c .",
    "while the reduction of @xmath19 is thus substantial , we find that @xmath19 is still _ not _ small compared to the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the properties of valence - band holes @xcite in the impurity potential @xmath18 due to the charged defects . in particular , we are interested in their spectrum and localisation properties .",
    "we employ the envelope function and parabolic - band approximations for the holes and start from the hamiltonian @xmath24 . for material - specific calculations the detailed band structure should be taken into account , _",
    "e.g. _ , using the 6-band kohn - luttinger hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this should not change the qualitative results but is known to increase the mean - field @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the hole hamiltonian is written in a plane - wave basis and diagonalized numerically @xcite .",
    "the calculations are done for spin - less holes , since the additional disorder introduced by the exchange interaction is found to be much smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum and normalized eigenfunctions @xmath26 . from the latter",
    "we calculate the inverse participation ratios @xmath27 of the states .",
    "the main physical content of the ipr is that it scales with system size for extended states but essentially remains constant for localized states .",
    "the ipr thus allows to estimate the position of the mobility edge in the valence band .",
    "ipr as a function of electron energy for @xmath10 and @xmath11 after various numbers of mc steps increasing from the red to the violet curve .",
    "the fermi energies for the random and the equilibrated case are also shown.,width=415 ]    figure [ fig.ipr1 ] shows the ipr as a function of electron energy for the same parameters as above , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , after various numbers of mc steps .",
    "the plot shows that uncorrelated defects would lead to the filling - in of the band gap by disorder , which is in contradiction to experiments .",
    "thus correlated defects are required to explain the persistence of the energy gap .",
    "we have also studied the ipr for various system sizes and find that states in the flat region and the upper part of the slope are extended , whereas states in the band tail are localized , as expected .",
    "figure [ fig.ipr1 ] shows that the states at the fermi energy become more and more extended with annealing , since the disorder potential decreases .",
    "ipr as a function of energy for equilibrated configurations as a function of mn concentration @xmath28 with the number of holes per mn , @xmath29 , chosen in accordance with experiments @xcite .",
    "the fermi energies are also indicated.,width=415 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig.ipr2 ] the ipr for fully annealed configurations is plotted as a function of mn concentration @xmath28 .",
    "the number of holes per mn , @xmath29 , has been chosen in accordance with experiments @xcite .",
    "the change in the ipr - curves with @xmath28 is rather weak due to the strong ionic screening .",
    "the main effect is the shift of the fermi energy due to the varying hole density , which drives the fermi edge into localized states below about 1% mn .",
    "this qualitatively explains the metal - insulator transition observed in ( ga , mn)as @xcite .",
    "finally , we turn to the magnetic properties . the bulk magnetisation is composed of contributions of the local mn spins and of the holes .",
    "since the exchange interaction between valence - band holes and local mn spins is antiferromagnetic , these contributions are oriented oppositely . however , the hole contribution turns out to be very small .",
    "we study the magnetisation within a selfconsitent mean - field approximation , which we briefly outline in the following .",
    "the starting point is the hamiltonian of the coupled valence - band holes and mn spins , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are mn spins ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 are hole spin polarisations at the mn sites . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the hole eigenenergies and eigenfunctions , respectively , for vanishing magnetic interaction , @xmath36 .",
    "these have been obtained in the previous section ",
    "note that @xmath7 contains the full coulomb disorder potential .",
    "@xmath34 includes the hole chemical potential .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ h10 ] ) as @xmath37\\ ] ] and employ the imaginary - time functional integral .",
    "the two spin - squared terms are decoupled using hubbard - stratonovich transformations with auxilliary fields @xmath38 coupling to @xmath39 .",
    "the auxilliary fields are then transformed to new fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to the lagrangian @xmath42 to obtain the mean - field theory we employ a saddle - point approximation .",
    "we assume @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be constant in time but _ not _ in space , since we wish to retain the disorder effects .",
    "the holes and mn spins are then easily integrated out . for",
    "the mn spins this is best done in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "this leads to the grand potential @xmath45}{\\sinh ( \\beta h'_i/2 ) }    + \\frac{\\beta}{j_{\\mathrm{pd } } } \\sum_i \\mathbf{h}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{h}'_i\\ ] ] with the mean - field hole green function @xmath46 the saddle - point equations are obtained by setting the derivatives of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 to zero , @xmath48 with the usual brillouin function @xmath49 . to actually evaluate eq .",
    "( [ sp10b ] ) we diagonalize the hole sector of the hamiltonian or , equivalently , the inverse green function @xmath50 , writing @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is diagonal .",
    "we assume the the mean - field mn spin polarisation @xmath53 to be collinear and choose the @xmath54 axis along @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath50 is symmetric and @xmath55 is orthogonal . also , @xmath50 is then already diagonal in spin space so that we can diagonalize separately in each spin sector .",
    "we denote the components of @xmath55 for spin sector @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "the inversion of @xmath58 is now trivial , @xmath59 .",
    "the frequency sum can finally be performed , since @xmath55 does not depend on frequency . introducing the new eigenfunctions @xmath60 equation ( [ sp10b ] )",
    "then obtains the form @xmath61 the mean - field solution is obtained by iterating eqs .",
    "( [ sp10a ] ) and ( [ sp10bb ] ) .",
    "magnetisation of mn spins ( up ) and hole spins ( down ) as functions of temperature for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for random , partially annealed , and equilibrated configurations .",
    "the dotted curves give the standard deviations @xmath62 of mn spins .",
    "for comparison , the long - dashed curves show the magnetisations obtained from a theory that totally neglects disorder.,width=415 ]    figure [ fig.magn ] shows the magnetisation curves for mn and hole spins , again for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for random and equilibrium configurations . the hole - spin contribution to the total magnetisation",
    "is found to be very small .",
    "the shape of the mn magnetisation curve becomes more `` normal '' and concave from below with annealing @xcite , except for a tail at higher temperatures , in good agreement with experimental annealing studies @xcite .",
    "the anomalous shape for random defects is due to the localisation tendency of the holes , which leads to a shorter - range effective mn spin interaction .",
    "this , together with the random positions of spins , leads to a broad distribution of effective fields acting on these spins . for higher temperatures , only a few spins with strong interactions",
    "carry most of the magnetisation , leading to the drawn out tail for random defects .",
    "the noise apparent on the curves is due to there being several saddle - points with similar free energy and total magnetisation .",
    "we also plot the standard deviations @xmath62 of the mn spin polarisations .",
    "the standard deviation becomes comparable with the average mn spin polarisation at intermediate temperatures below the curie temperature @xmath25 .",
    "this shows that the reduction of the total magnetisation with increasing temperature is initially dominated by disordering of large local moments . only at higher temperatures the local moments also decrease .",
    "the curie temperatures are significantly larger than what one obtains from a virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , neglecting disorder completely , see fig .",
    "[ fig.magn ] .",
    "it is an important open question whether this is an artifact of mean - field theory or indeed a physical result .",
    "however , the tails of the magnetisation curves with small average mn spin polarisation but large standard deviation are dominated by a few anomalously strongly coupled spins .",
    "these are overemphasized by mean - field theory ( remember that mean - field theory gives an incorrect finite polarisation even for two coupled spins ) .",
    "thermal fluctuations should be effective in destroying the long - range order in this case , thus reducing @xmath25 .",
    "magnetisation of mn spins ( up ) and hole spins ( down ) as functions of temperature for various mn and hole concentrations.,width=415 ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig.magn2 ] shows magnetisation curves for equilibrated configurations at various mn concentrations with the number of holes chosen as above .",
    "we see that the curves for smaller mn and hole concentrations become more similar to the random limit in fig .",
    "[ fig.magn ] , which is easily understood since the holes become more localized .",
    "we have shown that strong coulomb interactions in highly compensated diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors naturally lead to strong correlations in the positions of charged defects .",
