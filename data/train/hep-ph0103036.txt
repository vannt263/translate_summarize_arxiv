    "the meson @xmath7 , being a unique meson , contains two different heavy flavors .",
    "it decays by one of the two heavy flavors through weak interaction and it happens that the two have a comparable possibility each other in magnitude , or by the two heavy flavor annihilation , hence , its decay - channels which have a sizable branching ratio , are manifested much richer than those of the mesons @xmath15 etc .",
    "therefore one may study the two heavy flavors @xmath16 simultaneously with the meson @xmath7 alone , as long as its different weak decay channels can be distinguished from each other well .",
    "of all the mesons , in studying two heavy flavor @xmath16 simultaneously , @xmath7 is unique .",
    "the meson @xmath7 is just discovered very recently .",
    "the first positive observation was successful in cdf at tevatron , fermilab through the semi - leptonic decays @xmath17 , and the mass @xmath18 gev , the lifetime @xmath19 ps etc were obtained@xcite .    before the observation of cdf ,",
    "@xmath7-meson production@xcite , spectroscopy@xcite and various decays@xcite had been widely computed .",
    "now the further experimental studies of the meson are planned at tevatron ( in run ii ) and at lhc etc .",
    "particularly , in addition to cdf , d0 , atlas and cms , the detectors btev and lhcb are specially designed for b - physics , numerous @xmath20 events ( more than @xmath21 per year ) at these two colliders are expected to be recorded@xcite , so a lot of interesting decay channels of @xmath7 will be well - studied experimentally , and certain rare processes will become accessible . therefore , further extensive theoretical studies of this meson are freshly motivated .",
    "the semileptonic decays , @xmath22 , and the two - body nonleptonic decays , @xmath23 , i.e. the decays of the meson @xmath7 to a p - wave chamonium state are certainly interesting , but still missing in literature , thus we devote this paper to report our the latest computations on them , although the semileptonic decays were reported shortly@xcite .",
    "why the decays interest people , let us outline the reasons below .",
    "first of all , people would like to know how sizable the decays will be , especially , to know if accessible in run - ii of tevatron and/or in lhc .",
    "especially the cascade decays of @xmath24 and @xmath25 looks quite like as a signal for the observation of the meson @xmath7 through the decays @xmath26 , because the photon may be missed in detectors .",
    "in addition , two of the p - wave charmonia have a branching ratio about a few tenth for the radiative decays @xmath27 \\to j/\\psi+\\gamma$ ] ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 \\to j/\\psi+\\gamma$ ] ( @xmath30 ) , so indeed the cascade decays may potentially contribute a substantial background for the observation @xmath7 meson through @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , even only from the point of view to estimate the background for the observation on @xmath7 meson , to see how great the concerned decays is very interesting .",
    "if one would like to see @xmath31 violations in @xmath7 decays , for example , to see cp violation in the decays @xmath32 ( @xmath33 denote various possible mesons ) , as emphasized in ref.@xcite , one knows that the interference of the direct decays with a cascade one through a resonance , e.g. , @xmath34 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath35}+h$ ] and @xmath34\\to h_1+h_2 $ ] , may enhance the visible @xmath31 violation effects substantially .",
    "thus to see the advantage of this method for the purpose quantitatively , the knowledge on the decay @xmath36}+h$ ] is necessary .",
    "qcd - inspired potential model works very well for nonrelativistic double - heavy systems .",
    "the systems ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) in forming bound states , except the reduce mass , are similar to the well - studied systems ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) , so it is believed that with potential model the static properties of the systems ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) can be predicted very well as those of bottomium @xmath41 and charmonium @xmath42 . in general , to apply the wave functions to computing the relevant decay matrix elements is attracting , since the potential model will have further tests . thus with the wave functions of @xmath7 ( the ground state of the system of @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 ( the p - wave states of @xmath45 ) obtained by potential model , we have applied the wave functions to compute the decays @xmath46 .    since the mass of @xmath7 ( @xmath47 ) is much greater than those of the @xmath8-wave charmonia ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) ,",
    "so the momentum recoil in the concerned decays can be a great ( even relativistic ) . if one tries to apply the schrdinger wave functions of nonrelativistic binding systems to computing the decay processes with such a great ( even relativistic ) recoil momentum , one can not carry out the computation of the decay matrix element successfully just as done in atomic and nuclear decays by taking a suitable ` reference frame ' and then a simple ` boosting ' , since the recoil in an atomic or nuclear process is much smaller than that in the present concerned decays .",
    "the great momentum recoil obviously means the velocity between the two cms of @xmath7 meson and the charmonium state is huge , and the potential wave functions of the parent and the daughter states , given just in each cms respectively , can not be applied directly just by choosing a suitable reference frame and simple boosting the wave functions to the same frame .",
    "thus when applying the wave functions to calculation of the decays ( e.g. the semileptonic decays and most two - body nonleptonic decays here ) with such a great ( even relativistic ) momentum recoil , special handling is needed . to deal with the momentum",
    "recoil properly , an approach for the decays from a nonrelativistic @xmath50-wave state to another @xmath50-wave one , the so - called generalized instantaneous approximation , was proposed in ref.@xcite . since it is straightforward to extend from a nonrelativistic @xmath50-wave state to another @xmath50-wave one , to the present case , that the decays are from a nonrelativistic @xmath50-wave state to a @xmath8-wave one for the approach , hence here we do so .",
    "the key points of the approach may be outlined as the three steps : firstly , to ` extend ' the potential model , which is based on schrdinger equation , to the one on bethe - salpeter ( b.s . )",
    "equation and @xmath51 , to do the extension is just by means of the original instantaneous approximation proposed by salpeter , that can be found in many text book on quantum field theory e.g. the book @xcite to ` build ' the relation between the schrdinger equations and the relevant b.s . ones .",
    "] even for the non - relativistic binding systems ; then , according to mandelstam method@xcite to formulate the ( weak ) current matrix element ( an elementary factor for the relevant decays ) sandwiched by the b.s .",
    "wave functions of the two bound - state , so that the current matrix element is written in a fully relativistic formulation ; finally , by making the so - called ` generalized instantaneous approximation ' on the fully relativistic matrix element i.e. to integrate out the ` time ' component of the relative momentum in the mandelstam formulation by a contour integration , and as the final result , the current matrix element turns out back to be formulated in terms of proper operators sandwiched by the schrdinger wave functions of the ` original ' potential model . since the weak current matrix ( by means of the mandelstam method )",
    "was formulated relativistically , so we can be sure that the final formulation takes the recoil effects into account properly and no new free parameter is added at all . besides the great recoil effects are treated properly ,",
    "one additional advantage of the approach is that it has a more solid ground on quantum field theory than that on the ` original ' potential models , because the b.s .",
    "wave functions and the mandelstam formulation have a more solid ` ground ' on quantum field theories and they are used as a starting point to make the generalized instantaneous approximation .    on the other hand , b.s .",
    "equation is four - dimensional in space - time to describe a bound state problem , and there are a few problems still , such as , how to determine the qcd - inspired four - dimensional interaction kernel of the equation properly , and what is the physics meaning of the excitation in its relative - time ` freedom ' of the two components etc .",
    "in addition , the b.s . equation is harder than a schrdinger one to solve , even when the four - dimentional kernel is fixed .",
    "whereas with the generalized instantaneous approximation , the current matrix elements are reduced into certain proper operators sandwiched by the potential model schrdinger wave functions finally , therefore , the approach , in the meantime to circle the difficulty about treating the great momentum recoil effects properly , has also kept some of the advantages of potential model , such as to avoid the difficulty to solve the b.s .",
    "equations etc .",
    "finally we should note here that in our calculating the two - body nonleptonic decays of @xmath7 to the @xmath52wave @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , the so - called factorization assumption and the effective lagrangian for four fermions in which the ` short - distance ' qcd corrections have been taken into account with ope ( operator product expansion ) and rgm ( the renormalization group method ) , as done by most authors , are adopted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : to follow the introduction in section - ii , the exclusive semileptonic differential decay rates , the matrix elements and form factors etc are described . in section iii , the adopted approach , the so - called generalized instantaneous approximation , to compute the form factors",
    "is illustrated precisely . in section",
    "iv , the two - body non - leptonic decays of @xmath7 are formulated with necessary description . finally in section",
    "v , numerical results and discussions are presented .",
    "the dependence of the current matrix elements on the form factors , and the dependence of the form factors on @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the integrations of the wave function overlapping , are put in appendix .",

    "note here that we have kept the mass of the lepton @xmath80 precisely that is different from those by n. isgur et al@xcite and by b. grinstein et al@xcite , so the formula here can be applied not only to the cases of @xmath81 and @xmath82 semileptonic decays but also to those of @xmath83-semileptonic decays .",

    "the decay amplitudes for the non - leptonic decays can be formulated into the three factors : the so - called leptonic decay constants , which are defined by the matrix elements : @xmath260 ( or @xmath261 ) ; the weak current matrix elements @xmath262 , which are those as the semileptonic decays ; and the relevant coefficients in the combinations : @xmath263 and @xmath264 , here @xmath265 and @xmath266 is number of color .",
    "the coefficients in the combination @xmath267 is due to the weak currents being ` fierz - reordered ' . in the numerical calculation",
    "later on , we will choose @xmath268 and @xmath269 , i.e. , we take @xmath270 in the spirit of the large @xmath266 limit , and qcd correction coefficients @xmath257 and @xmath258 are computed at the energy scale of @xmath271 .",
    "therefore with the relations between the currents and form factors obtained as in the semileptonic decays , finally the factorized amplitudes for the nonleptonic decays can be formulated in terms of the form factors and the decay constants by definitions : @xmath260 and @xmath272 .",
    "thus the decay widths for the two - body nonleptonic decays can be computed straightforward .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results .            and corresponding radial wave - functions of @xmath7 meson and @xmath8-wave charmonium @xmath284 numerically .",
    "here in the present evaluations , we only carry out the lowest order ones without considering the splitting caused by @xmath285 and @xmath286 couplings , in which all the bound states @xmath287 and @xmath206 are degenerated .    to see the behaviors of the universal function @xmath288 and @xmath289 i.e. the two overlapping integrations of the wave functions of initial and final states , we plot them explicitly in fig.1 , where @xmath290 .    the lepton energy spectra for the decays @xmath291 , for which the mass of charged lepton can be ignored , are shown in fig.2 , and those for the decays @xmath292 , for which the mass of charged lepton @xmath83 can not be ignored , are shown in fig.3 , where @xmath293 is the momentum of lepton . the difference between fig.2 and fig.3 is due to the sizable mass of @xmath83-lepton . for",
    "the semileptonic decays , we put the corresponding widths in table i.    as for the non - leptonic two - body decays @xmath294 , we only evaluate some typical channels , whose widths are relatively larger , and put results in table ii . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath268 and @xmath269 , i.e. , @xmath270 , and @xmath257 and @xmath258 are computed at the energy scale of @xmath271 .",
    "the values of the decay constants : @xmath295 gev , @xmath296 gev , @xmath297 gev , @xmath298 gev , @xmath299 gev , @xmath300 gev , @xmath301 gev , @xmath302 gev , @xmath303 gev are adopted by fitting decays of @xmath304 and @xmath305 mesons .",
    "if comparing the results in table 1 with the decays of @xmath7 to @xmath50-wave charmonium states @xmath99 and @xmath100 e.g. @xmath306gev@xcite , one can realize the semileptonic decays of @xmath7 to the @xmath8-wave charmonium states in magnitude are about tenth of the decay @xmath307 .",
    "as for the two - body nonleptonic decays , due to the difference in momentum recoil and the fact that the recoil momentum is fixed in a given specific decay , the @xmath8-wave decay @xmath23 can be greater than twentieth of the one , @xmath308 , to an @xmath50-wave state .",
    "the first observation of @xmath7 by cdf group is through the semileptonic decay @xmath307 , hence , we can conclude that most of the decays concerned here are accessible in run - ii of tevatron and in lhc , especially , when the particular detector for @xmath304 physics btev and lhcb at the two colliders are concerned .",
    "it is because that tevatron and lhc will have more than 20 time events of @xmath7 meson than run - i and have much better detectors .",
    "since the decays @xmath11+l+\\nu_l$ ] have such a quite sizable branching ratio , so the cascade decays i.e. the decays with an according one of the radiative decays @xmath12 \\to j/\\psi+\\gamma$ ] followed may affect the observation through the semileptonic decays @xmath309 as done by cdf group substantially , especially , when the efficiency of detecting a photons for the detector is not great enough .",
    "we also would like to point out here that with sizable branching ratio , the decays @xmath310 and/or @xmath311 potentially can open a fresh ` window ' to observe the charmonium state @xmath312 $ ] , especially , to note that the charmonium state @xmath312 $ ] has not been well - established experimentally yet .",
