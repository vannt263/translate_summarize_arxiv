    "another important formation channel for ethynyl is by surface hydrogenation of precursor species , c@xmath1 .",

    "photodissociation of cch into c@xmath1 and h ( with the rate constant @xmath74  s@xmath20 and a@xmath75 exponent @xmath76 ) and photoionization ( @xmath77  s@xmath20 , @xmath78 ) are efficient @xcite . at later times , in colder disk regions depletion and gas - phase reactions with more complex species may enter into this cycle .",
    "one can restore high concentrations of cch obtained at early times , @xmath79  years by destroying co and enriching the gas with elemental carbon . in disk",
    "it happens in the inner region either by reactions of co with ionized helium atoms produced by the stellar x - ray radiation , or directly upon irradiation of co by uv photons .",
    "this second rise in the cch concentration is typically reached only at very late times in our models , @xmath80  myr .    the relative importance of x - ray and uv radiation is shown in fig .",

    "thus cch is indeed a sensitive tracer of the uv radiation field .",
    "the lack of x - ray irradiation results in a less `` sharp '' inner shape of the upper cch layer ( compare left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : cch_abunds_fact ] ) , and low cch abundances in the intermediate layer . in the absence of x - ray radiation",
    ", ionized helium is only produced by interactions with cosmic ray particles , and thus replenishment of c@xmath0 and o into the gas upon destruction of co by he@xmath0 is lower . still , there is an `` island '' of high cch concentration in the intermediate layer at @xmath82  au in the model of dm  tau without x - rays .",
    "mwc  480 , as a herbig ae star , emits @xmath83 and @xmath84 times more uv photons than lkca  15 and dm  tau , respectively , but has a weak x - ray luminosity ( see table  [ tab : coord ] ) .",
    "consequently , the upper cch layer is more noticeable in the mwc  480 disk , where a larger fraction of elemental carbon can be kept from being locked in co and other species by photodissociation .",

    "using our chemical analyzing software , we found that the oasis of cch in mwc  480 is due to efficient surface hydrogenation of c@xmath1 ice , and other surface reactions ( e.g. , photodissociation of c@xmath1h@xmath1 ice , and surface formation of c@xmath1 from two c atoms ) .",

    "[ fig : cch_cd ] , right panel .",

    "thus , indeed the ethynyl radical can serve as a sensitive probe of the impinging x - ray radiation field .",
    "in general , it is the stellar uv luminosity that affects the evolution of cch globally , with x - ray radiation being only important in inner disk regions ( @xmath99  au ) .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , the stellar uv luminosity can be a crucial factor that makes the ab aur system chemically poorer with respect to the disk of dm tau .",
    "the same trend is found here for c@xmath1h and the disks around mwc  480 and dm  tau .",

    "furthermore , the results of the steady - state disk chemical model is in qualitative agreement with the cch column densities obtained by @xmath4-fitting of the spectral maps .",
    "in contrast to our cid1 paper @xcite , where such a model could not fit well the radial slope of the n@xmath1h@xmath0 column densities , in the case of cch the flat distribution is obtained both from the analysis of the interferometric data and chemical modeling .",
    "our chemical modeling predicts that two cch molecular layers are located at elevated disk heights , or in warm disk regions ( @xmath100  k ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the very low excitation temperature of the cch emission derived for dm tau .",
    "the critical densities for the cch ( 1 - 0 ) and cch(2 - 1 ) lines to be thermalized are @xmath101  @xmath102 and @xmath103  @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "which factors that are not taken into account in our simplified chemical modeling could lead to a substantial concentration of cch in the cold disk midplane of dm tau and lkca  15 ? as we have found in @xcite ( and later confirmed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , turbulent transport can enhance the co concentration in the dm tau disk midplane such that @xmath3co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines are indeed `` cold '' ( @xmath105  k ) .",
    "later , @xcite have shown that the scattering of the stellar uv radiation by pahs and dust grains in upper disk atmosphere can redirect a portion of these uv photons into the disk , allowing co to efficiently desorb from dust grains in the cold disk zone .",
    "despite the fact that this assumption is not considered in our model , where desorption of surface molecules in the disk midplane is only due to the crp - driven uv radiation and crp heating , a non - negligible amount of cch exists in the outer disk midplane at @xmath106  k , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cold_cch ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the cch column density in dm tau at @xmath106  k has a maximum value of @xmath107  @xmath32 at @xmath108  au , which rapidly decreases with radius . in warmer regions of the dm tau disk",
    "the cch column density is about 5 times higher , @xmath109  @xmath32 , and has an almost flat profile .",
    "thus , we expect that only @xmath110 of the cch ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) line fluxes arise from the cold disk zone .",
    "the amount of cold gases in disk midplanes can also be increased if gas - grain interactions are ineffective such that freeze - out is delayed toward late evolutionary times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we did several test calculations with bigger grains of @xmath92 m and found that indeed neutral species become more abundant in cold disk region .",
    "the results for molecular chemistry in disks using a realistic grain evolutionary model will be reported in a separate publication .",
    "in essence , in evolving disks substantial amount of gas - phase molecules in very cold region can be produced and sustained by moderate grain growth and sedimentation of micron - sized and bigger grains toward the midplane , while a fraction of smaller grains and pahs remains in the disk atmosphere and provides enough opacities to keep the disk interior cool ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , in our disk model dust thermal balance is used to compute the temperature distribution , which is assumed to be the same for the gas . in the disk atmosphere gas",
    "will be hotter due to e.g. photoelectric heating of small dust grains / pahs by stellar / is uv & x - rays photons .",
    "we do not take this effect into account . for cch lines",
    "it is of no concern as derived low excitation temperatures for the 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 transitions are indicative of a substantial amount of ethynyl being located in the cold disk zone around the midplane .",
    "in addition , our modeling results show that the majority of cch is located at scale heights of @xmath111 for dm tau and lkca 15 and is even closer to the disk midplane for mwc 480 ( fig .",
