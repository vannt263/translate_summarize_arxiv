    "feature of any future smart grid is the promise of a data - driven approach to automated monitoring , control , and decision as opposed to the current simulation - driven methods .",
    "the paradigm shift to a data - driven framework enables a deeper integration of data collection and sophisticated data processing into the monitoring and control process .",
    "while extracting actionable information from real - time sensor data can make a grid more efficient and adaptive to real - time operating conditions , it exposes the grid to possible cyber data attacks aimed at disrupting grid operations and potentially causing blackouts .",
    "in @xcite , liu , ning , and reiter presented perhaps the first framework for a man - in - the - middle ( mim ) attack on the power system state estimation where an adversary would replace `` normal '' sensor data with `` malicious data . ''",
    "it was shown that , if the adversary could gain control of a sufficient number of meters , it could perturb the state estimate by an arbitrary amount without being detected by the bad data detector employed at the control center .",
    "such undetectable attacks are referred to as _ covert data attacks_.    the condition under which a covert data attack is possible was subsequently found in @xcite to be equivalent to that of system unobservability . in particular ,",
    "a covert attack is possible if and only if the system becomes unobservable when the meters under attack are removed .",
    "( or equivalently , the adversary is able to control a critical set of meters . )",
    "the minimum number of meters that an adversary has to control in order to launch a covert data attack , referred to as a _ security index _ , is an important measure of security against a data attack .",
    "it represents a fundamental limit on the capability of an adversary to covertly disrupt the operation of a grid .    in this paper , we show that a significant barrier on the capability of an adversary to mount an attack of the type described above can be circumvented by using a different form of attacks , that is , one that exploits the vulnerabilities of the existing bad data detection and removal mechanisms . in particular , we show that the adversary only needs to gain control of about half of the meters required by the security index while achieving the same objective of perturbing the state estimate by an arbitrary amount without being detected .",
    "the attacks considered in this paper are referred to as _ data framing attacks _ , borrowing the notion of framing as that of providing false evidence to make someone innocent appear to be guilty of misconduct . in the context of state estimation , a data framing attack means that an adversary launches a data attack in such a way that the control center identifies properly functioning meters as sources of bad data . to this end",
    ", the attacker does not try to cause malicious data to pass the bad data detection without detection ( as a covert attack tries to do ) .",
    "instead , it purposely triggers the bad data detection mechanism and causes erroneous removal of good data .",
    "unknown to the control center , the remaining data still contain adversary - injected malicious data , causing errors in the state estimate .",
    "there is an extensive literature on _ covert data attacks _ , following the work of liu , ning , and reiter @xcite .",
    "while the data framing attack mechanism proposed here is fundamentally different , insights gained from existing work are particularly relevant . here , we highlight some of these ideas from the literature .",
    "an explicit link between a covert attack on state estimation and system observability was made in .",
    "consequently , classical observability conditions can be modified for a covert attack and used to develop meter protection strategies .",
    "a particularly important concept is the notion of a critical set of meters . in assessing the vulnerability of the grid ,",
    "the minimum number of meters necessary for a covert attack was suggested as a security index for the grid in .",
    "subsequently , meter protection strategies were proposed in to optimize this security index .",
    "the framing attack strategy considered here relies on bad data identification and removal techniques that have long been the subject of study .",
    "see for example and the references therein .",
    "typically , the residue vectors in normalized forms are widely used as statistics for the bad data test . in particular ,",
    "proposed a hypothesis testing method , in which the set of suspect measurements are determined by the residue analysis in .",
    "the use of non - quadratic cost functions in state estimation was also studied to enhance bad data identification performance .",
    "especially , the weighted least absolute value estimation @xcite and the least median of squares regression @xcite were considered as alternatives with comparably good performance . in this paper , we take the residue analysis in as a representative bad data test and analyze the effect of a framing attack . however , the same analysis is applicable to other bad data tests .",
    "detection of data attacks on state estimation , referred to as _ state attacks _ , has been also studied in various frameworks .",
    "kosut  _ et al._@xcite presented a generalized likelihood ratio test for detection .",
    "morrow  _ et al._@xcite proposed the detection mechanism based on network parameter perturbation which deliberately modifies the line parameters and probes whether the measurements respond accordingly to the modification . distributed detection and estimation of adversarial perturbation",
    "was also studied in @xcite . in an effort to minimize the detection delay ,",
    "the attack detection was also formulated as a quickest detection problem , and modified cusum algorithms were proposed in @xcite .",
    "we propose a data framing attack on power system state estimation .",
    "specifically , we formulate the design of an optimal data framing attack as a quadratically constrained quadratic program ( qcqp ) . unlike general qcqps , which are np - hard",
    ", the proposed qcqp can be solved by finding a maximum eigenvalue of a matrix .",
    "to analyze the efficacy of our data framing attack , we present a sufficient condition under which the attack could achieve an arbitrary perturbation of the state estimate by controlling only half of the critical set of meters .",
    "we demonstrate the concept using both the ieee 14-bus network and the ieee 118-bus network and show that the sufficient condition holds for the critical sets associated with cuts .",
    "the optimal design of our framing attack is based on a linearized system . in practice",
    ", a nonlinear state estimator is often used .",
    "we demonstrate that , under the usual nonlinear measurement model , a framing attack designed based on a linearized system model successfully perturbs the state estimate , and the attacker is able to control the degree of perturbation as desired .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : prelim_baddata ] introduces the measurement and adversary models including preliminaries related to state attacks .",
    "section  [ sec : se ] presents the state estimation and bad data processing methodology . in section  [ sec : frame_attack ] , we present the main idea of the data framing attack and the qcqp framework for the attack design .",
    "section  [ sec : factor_of_two ] provides a theoretical justification of the efficacy of the data framing attack . in section  [ sec : numerical_baddata ] , we test the data framing attack with the ieee 14-bus network and the ieee 118-bus network .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion_frame ] provides concluding remarks .",
    "this section introduces the topology and system state of a power network , the meter measurement model , and the adversary model .",
    "in addition , the covert state attack and its connection with network observability are explained . throughout the paper ,",

    "a power network is a network of buses connected by transmission lines , and thus the _ topology _ of the grid can be naturally defined as an undirected graph @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of buses , and @xmath16 is the set of lines connecting buses ( @xmath17 if and only if bus @xmath2 and bus @xmath18 are connected . )",
    "the _ system state _ of a power network is defined as the vector of bus voltage magnitudes and phase angles , from which all the other quantities ( _ e.g. _ , power line flows , power injections , line currents ) can be calculated .    in order to compute a real - time estimate of the system state",
    ", a control center collects measurements from line flow and bus injection meters deployed throughout the grid .",
    "the meter measurements are related to the system state @xmath3 in a nonlinear fashion , and the relation is described by the ac power flow model : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nonlinear measurement function , and @xmath21 is the gaussian measurement noise with a diagonal covariance matrix .",
    "if some of the meters malfunction or an adversary injects malicious data , the control center observes biased measurements , @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents a deterministic bias .",
    "in such a case , the data are said to be _ bad _ , and the biased meter entries are referred to as _ bad data entries_. note that even when a meter is protected from adversarial modification , it may still have a bias due to a physical malfunction or an improper parameter setting ; filtering out the measurements from such malfunctioning meters was the original objective of the legacy bad data processing and is still in practice today .    even though the model in ( [ eq : ac_baddata ] ) is nonlinear , the state estimate is generally obtained by iterations of weighted linear least squares estimation with the locally linearized model .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to analyze the performance of state estimation using the locally linearized model around the system operating point . to this end , in analyzing the impact of an attack on state estimation , we adopt the so - called dc model . in the dc model , for ease of analysis ,",
    "the ac model ( [ eq : ac_baddata ] ) is linearized around the system state where all voltage phasors are equal to @xmath24 , and only the real part of the measurements are retained : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the measurement vector consisting of real part of line flow and bus injection measurements , the system state @xmath27 is the vector of voltage phase angles at all buses except the reference bus ( @xmath3 is unknown , but deterministic ) , @xmath28 is the dc measurement matrix that relates the system state to bus injection and line flow amounts , and @xmath21 is the gaussian measurement noise with a diagonal covariance matrix @xmath12 .",
    "we represent the noise covariance matrix @xmath12 as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a diagonal matrix representing the variation of noise variances across different meters ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is a scaling factor .",
    "each row of @xmath7 has a special structure depending on the type of the meter .",
    "for ease of presentation , consider the noiseless measurement @xmath33 .",
    "if an entry @xmath34 of @xmath35 is the measurement of the line flow from bus @xmath2 to bus @xmath18 , @xmath34 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the line susceptance and @xmath1 is the voltage phase angle at bus @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath34 is the measurement of bus injection at @xmath2 , it is the sum of all the outgoing line flows from @xmath2 , and the corresponding row of @xmath7 is the sum of the row vectors corresponding to all the outgoing line flows .",
    "any analysis based on the dc model needs to be verified using realistic ac model simulations ; we demonstrate in section  [ sec : numerical_baddata ] that the proposed attack strategy is effective using ac model simulations .",
    "we consider a man - in - the - middle attack on power system state estimation , where , as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : se_attack_analog ] , an adversary is assumed to be capable of modifying the data from a subset of analog meters @xmath38 .",
    "we refer to the meters in @xmath38 as _ adversary meters_.    the control center observes corrupted measurements @xmath39 instead of the actual measurements @xmath35 in ( [ eq : ac_baddata ] ) .",
    "we assume that the adversary knows the line parameters ( _ i.e. _ , the measurement function @xmath40 and the measurement matrix @xmath7 . )",
    "the adversarial modification is mathematically modeled as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath23 is an attack vector , and @xmath42 is the set of feasible attack vectors defined as @xmath43 note that @xmath42 fully characterizes the ability of the adversary .",
    "in addition , the adversary is assumed to design a vector @xmath23 without observing any entry of @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the attack does not require any real - time observation .      for state estimation to be feasible",
    ", the control center needs to have enough meter measurements so that the system state can be uniquely determined .",
    "formally , a power network is said to be _ locally observable _ at a state @xmath44 if the system state can be uniquely determined from the noiseless meter measurements @xmath45 in a neighborhood of @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the jacobian of @xmath40 at @xmath44 has full rank .",
    "however , due to the intractability of checking local observability for all feasible operating points , the dc model ( [ eq : dc_baddata ] ) is generally adopted for observability analysis : the network is said to be _",
    "observable _ if the dc measurement matrix @xmath7 has full rank . in practice",
    ", power networks should be designed to satisfy the observability requirement .",
    "hence , we assume that the network of interest is observable ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath7 has full rank . )    the concept of network observability is closely related to the feasibility of a covert state attack . in particular , we need to introduce the concept of a critical set of meters , formally defined as follows .",

    "[ fig : se_attack_analog ] illustrates an iterative scheme for obtaining @xmath56 , which consists of three functional blocks : state estimation , bad data detection , and bad data identification .",

    "the state estimator uses @xmath64 as an input , and obtains the weighted least squares ( wls ) estimate of the system state : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the covariance matrix of the corresponding noise vector .",
    "based on the state estimate , the residue vector is also evaluated : @xmath67    we assume that the @xmath68-test is employed for bad data detection : the bad data detector makes a decision based on the sum of weighted squared residues : @xmath69 the @xmath68-test is widely used due to its low complexity and the fact that the test statistic has a @xmath70 distribution if the data are good .",
    "the latter fact is used to set the threshold @xmath71 for a given false alarm constraint .",

    "a widely used criterion for identifying a bad data entry is the normalized residue , which is considered one of the most reliable criteria@xcite . in the normalized residue analysis , each @xmath73",

    "in this section , we present a new attack strategy on state estimation , referred to as a _ data framing attack _ , which exploits the bad data processing to remove data from some normally operating meters and make the adversary meters appear to be trustworthy .",
    "we present the main idea and the qcqp framework for an optimal attack strategy .",
    "we focus our attention on the case where the adversary can not control enough meters to launch a covert attack .",
    "a framing attack starts with setting the set of _ framed meters _ , denoted by @xmath92 , which it aims to frame as sources of bad data .",
    "the framed meter set @xmath92 is chosen such that after the meters in @xmath92 are removed from the network , a covert attack with the adversary meters in @xmath38 becomes feasible .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath93 is a critical set .",
    "the feasibility condition of a covert attack in theorem  [ thm : kosut ] implies that if @xmath94 is removed from the network , then the adversary with @xmath38 can launch a covert attack ; because , further removing all meters in @xmath38 makes the network unobservable .",
    "therefore , a framing attack can set @xmath92 to be @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting perturbation of the state estimate by a framing attack does depend on the choice of @xmath92 .",
    "finding an optimal @xmath92 for a given attack objective is certainly an important problem .",
    "however , it is out of scope of this paper .",
    "we focus on the design of the attack vector for a fixed @xmath92 .      to analyze how an attack affects the bad data processing , we analyze , using the dc model ( [ eq : dc_baddata ] ) , the adversarial effect on the normalized residue vector at the first iteration .",
    "in this subsection , we omit the superscript to simplify notation : all the quantities we consider are associated with the first iteration unless otherwise specified .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 is a measurement vector _ without _ bad data .",
    "the normalized residue in the first iteration is obtained as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined as in ( [ eq : norm_matrix ] ) . due to the normalization",
    ", each entry @xmath97 is distributed as @xmath98 unless @xmath99 is a critical set ; if @xmath99 is a critical set , @xmath97 is equal to zero for any @xmath35 .",
    "if an attack vector @xmath23 is added , the resulting normalized residue is @xmath100 thus , if @xmath99 is not a critical set , @xmath97 is distributed as @xmath101 ; if @xmath99 is critical , @xmath102 surely .",
    "recalling that the absolute normalized residues ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath103 ) are the statistics used for identifying the bad data entries , one intuitive heuristic to frame the meters in @xmath92 as bad is to make the mean energy of the normalized residues at the framed meters as large as possible . making the framed meters have large normalized residues at the first iteration is of course not a guarantee that their data will be identified as bad and removed in the subsequent iterations .",
    "nevertheless , this is a reasonable heuristic to avoid the difficult task of analyzing the dynamic adversarial effect in subsequent iterations .",
    "note that the expected energy of the normalized residues at the framed meters is @xmath104 = \\sum_{i\\in{\\mathscr{s}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny f}}}{\\mathbb{e}}[(\\tilde{r}_{i})^{2 } ] = \\sum_{i\\in{\\mathscr{s}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny f}}}(\\bm{\\omega } { { \\bf { w}}}{{\\bf { a}}})_{i}^{2 } + c,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the number of the meters in @xmath92 that do not form a single - element critical set .",
    "therefore , maximizing the mean energy of the normalized residues at @xmath92 is equivalent to maximizing @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the row - selection matrix that retains only the rows corresponding to the framed meters .",
    "the ultimate objective of a framing attack is to gain an ability to perturb the state estimate by an arbitrary degree . to this end ,",
    "a framing attack aims to accomplish two tasks .",
    "the first is to make the bad data processing remove the framed meters such that a covert attack exists in the network with the remaining meters .",
    "as discussed in section  [ subsec : effect_rn ] , we attempt to achieve this goal by maximizing the mean energy of the normalized residues at @xmath92 , which is equivalent to maximizing @xmath108 .",
    "the second task is to ensure that the attack becomes covert once the framed meters are removed , thereby making the attack as effective as a covert attack ( _ i.e. _ , enable perturbation of the state estimate by an arbitrary degree . )",
    "let @xmath109 denote the @xmath110 measurement matrix obtained from @xmath7 by replacing the rows corresponding to the framed meters with zero row vectors .",
    "then , the attack becomes covert after the framed meters are removed ( _ i.e. _ , the attack vector lies in the column space of the remaining measurement matrix , ) if and ony if @xmath23 is in @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , we restrict the attack vector @xmath23 to be not only in the feasible set @xmath42 but also in @xmath111 .    based on the aforementioned intuition , we solve the following optimization to find the optimal _ direction _ to align the attack vector : @xmath112 the optimization ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) gives the optimal direction @xmath113 of an attack vector that maximizes the mean energy of the normalized residues at @xmath92 , among the feasible directions that render the attack covert after the framed meters are removed .    to provide a more intuitive description of the feasible set of ( [ eq : high_level_des ] )",
    ", we introduce the @xmath114 matrix @xmath115 obtained from @xmath7 by removing the rows corresponding to the adversary meters and the framed meters .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath116 if and only if @xmath117 for some @xmath118 . therefore , the dimension of @xmath119 is equal to the dimension of @xmath120 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath121 is a critical set , @xmath115 has rank @xmath122 , and its null space has dimension one .",
    "therefore , in this case , @xmath119 is a one - dimensional space , and there is no need to search for the optimal direction . on the other hand , if @xmath121 contains more than one critical sets , the dimension of @xmath120 is greater than one , and the optimization ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) searches for the optimal direction in the infinite set of feasible directions .    finally , we set an attack vector @xmath23 as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a parameter that adjusts the direction ( _ i.e. _ , positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath125 ) and the magnitude of the resulting perturbation of the state estimate .",
    "the injected attack vector will cause the bad data detector to invoke the bad data identification mechanism for several iterations .",
    "it is important to point out that removal of all the framed meters is _ not _ necessary although it does guarantee the successful perturbation of the state estimate .",
    "let @xmath126 denote the total number of iterations in state estimation .",
    "then , the state estimate is obtained by finding the linear wls estimate ( [ eq : wls_dc ] ) to fit @xmath127 using the columns of @xmath128 . and ,",
    "as long as @xmath127 contains a meter data modified by the attacker , the state estimate will be distorted to fit the adversarially modified data . in some circumstances ,",
    "an attack vector designed by ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) might cause removal of only a part of the framed meters and some of the adversary meters",
    ". nevertheless , such removal may still be able to make some adversary meter data remain in @xmath127 thereby leading to a successful attack .",
    "the optimization ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) can be written as a qcqp : @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the basis matrix of the @xmath132-dimensional vector space @xmath119 .",
    "note that the dimension @xmath132 is nonzero because @xmath92 is set such that the feasible set of ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) is nonempty .",

    "the positive definiteness of @xmath134 implies that a solution exists ( _ i.e. _ , the objective function is bounded below . )",

    "the optimal solution @xmath138 of ( [ eq : qcqp_y ] ) is the one that results in the minimum objective function value among all @xmath139 pairs satisfying the kkt conditions ( [ eq : kkt ] ) .",

    "the second equation means that the objective function value at @xmath142 is equal to @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , we can find an optimal solution @xmath138 of ( [ eq : qcqp_y ] ) as follows : ( i ) find the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath141 , and ( ii ) find an eigenvector @xmath138 in the corresponding eigenspace that satisfies @xmath144 .",
    "once @xmath138 is found , an optimal solution @xmath113 of the original problem ( [ eq : high_level_des ] ) is obtained as @xmath145 .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that a framing attack enables the attacker controlling only a half of a critical set of meters to perturb the state estimate by an arbitrary degree . specifically , given a partition @xmath146 of a critical set of meters , we present a sufficient condition under which the attacker can control one of @xmath147 or @xmath148 to perturb the state estimate by an arbitrary degree .",
    "we provide the numerical evidence based on the ieee benchmark networks that for a critical set associated with a cut , we can find a partition with @xmath149 satisfying the sufficient condition .      the exact analysis of how a framing attack would perturb the state estimate is a difficult task due to the iterative nature of state estimation and bad data processing .",
