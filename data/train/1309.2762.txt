    "wigner crystallization  @xcite is among the most striking quantum many body effects .",
    "a wigner crystal can emerge in two and three dimensions when the interaction energy among electrons dominates over the kinetic one  @xcite . in one dimension ( 1d ) , due to quantum fluctuations",
    ", a true crystal can not be established , but when the correlation length exceeds the size of the sample , electrons can form a so called wigner molecule , the finite counterpart of the wigner crystal .",
    "the formation of wigner molecules is not limited to the 1d case , but has been intensively studied in two dimensions as well  @xcite .",
    "+ an ideal playground for studying correlated electrons , including wigner molecules , are quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "electronic correlations have been extensively studied in two dimensional quantum dots , mainly using numerical techniques ,  @xcite and the emergence of the wigner molecule has been demonstrated . due to the high level of symmetry of the typical circular two dimensional quantum dots ,",
    "the density profile of the wigner molecule is rotationally invariant .",
    "a major implication of this issue is that the electron density is not effective in the characterization of the wigner molecule  @xcite and attempts at imaging the correlated electron wavefunction employing a scanning tunnel microscope ( stm ) have been put forward  @xcite .    in finite size 1d systems",
    "the scenario is different  @xcite . here , due to the broken translational invariance",
    ", the formation of the wigner molecule can be investigated via the electron density .",
    "indeed it has been shown that increasing interaction or decreasing the density , a crossover in the density between the friedel and wigner oscillations occurs .",
    "this result is supported both by analytical  @xcite and numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to study the density oscillations arising due to the formation of a wigner molecule , the properties of 1d quantum dots coupled to afm tips have been explored ,  @xcite a set up proposed  @xcite also for the detection of spin charge separation ,  @xcite another hallmark of one - dimensional electron systems .",
    "coupling quantum dots to stm tips has also been proposed .",
    "it was indeed suggested in order to detect vibrations  @xcite and friedel oscillations  @xcite and more recently for the detection of the wigner molecules  @xcite .",
    "as long as this last issue is concerned , the investigation relied on exact diagonalization performed numerically , and hence restricted to the case of few electrons only .    in order to extend the numerical results to many particles ,",
    "analytical models must be employed .",
    "the luttinger liquid theory  @xcite has been successfully adopted in the description of 1d quantum dots ,  @xcite even in the wigner crystal regime  @xcite .",
    "it represents the low energy sector of 1d microscopic models , ranging from the hubbard one  @xcite to ones directly related to the wigner molecule , in which electrons oscillate around their equilibrium positions  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the effects of temperature on the wigner and friedel correlations in a 1d quantum dot .",
    "the temperature range of our investigation is such that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the charge and spin bandwidth , and hence the dot is modeled within the coherent luttinger liquid picture  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that wigner correlations emerge over the friedel ones when temperature is raised up to the temperature of the spin addition energy @xmath2",
    "the reason for this emergence is the suppression of the friedel oscillations : when spin excitations are thermally activated friedel oscillations with different wavelength superimpose and result in an overall suppression of their amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "wigner oscillations are robust against the increase of temperature , since they are not sensitive to the spin excitations but to the charge ones which lie , in presence of strong interaction , at a much higher excitation energy .",
    "we prove this behavior by studying the thermal electron density and the linear conductance in the presence of an stm tip .",
    "this latter probe is chosen since it is not directly proportional to the electron density and supports the universality of the above phenomena , providing independent information .",

    "wigner oscillations , on the other hands , are insensitive to this scale and stable , since they are connected to the charge addition energy @xmath200 only .",
    "consequently , at strong enough interactions where @xmath201 we expect a finite temperature range @xmath202 where wigner correlations are dominant and more easily detectable . only at even higher temperatures @xmath203 , where the quantum dot contains different particle numbers ( not considered here ) wigner oscillation will be also depressed .",
    "+ finally it is worth noticing that the role of the spin density waves , that are automatically included in the tunneling rates at finite temperature , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) , is to strengthen the suppression of the friedel oscillations .",
    "+ finally , a brief comment on the non - linear transport regime for @xmath204 . indeed , even at low temperature @xmath107 but large enough voltage @xmath205 we expect a similar suppression of the friedel signal in comparison to the wigner one , due to the stochastic population of transport channels involving different spin zero modes .",
    "this issue is being analyzed at the moment .",
    "we have studied the temperature - induced emergence of wigner correlations over finite - size effects in a strongly interacting 1d quantum dot , within the coherent luttinger liquid picture .",
    "we demonstrated that , for temperatures comparable with the zero mode spin excitations , friedel oscillations are suppressed by the cancellations due to superposition of oscillations with several different subperiods : wigner oscillations are consequently enhanced and stable .",
    "+ this effect is shown to be general and occurs both in the electron density and in the linear conductance in the presence of an stm tip .",
    "the evidence brought by this latter probe is of particular significance since it is not directly affected by the electron density , thus bringing complementary , independent information with respect to the latter .",
    "+ for an experimental observation of the above predictions , a clean electron systems is very important since disorder may pin the wigner molecule distorting its shape , as well as directly influence the transport properties of the channel . in this sense .",
    "possible candidates could be semiconducting systems  @xcite which however are rather difficult to be investigated with stm probes due to a low density of states .",
    "carbon nanotubes are other notable systems which should exhibit the effects discussed above , being characterized by high mobilities and being well suited to the investigation by means of an stm  @xcite the extension of the above theory to the case of a carbon nanotube will be the subject of future work .",
