    "a dependence of phase shifts on a choice of fitting functions for the potentials is estimated by changing the fitting function to a yukawa - type .",
    "it turns out that the former dominates the systematic error except that the latter dominates in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "although the magnitude of the phase shifts obtained from our potentials are smaller than the experimental ones , general trends are well reproduced except for the @xmath1 case at low energies .",
    "the missing attraction in the @xmath1 channel is likely due to the weak tensor force @xmath181 caused by the large pion mass . among others ,",
    "the most interesting feature in fig.[fig : phase ] is the attraction in the @xmath3 channel , which is directly related to the paring correlation of the neutrons inside the neutron stars .    to obtain an intuitive understanding of the behavior of these phase shifts , we plot the potentials of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels in fig.[fig : eff - pot ] , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : effective - potentials-1])-([eq : effective - potentials-3 ] ) and below .",
    "indeed , one can see that @xmath182 has a weak repulsive core surrounded by an attractive well ; the attraction is driven by the strongly attractive ls force , @xmath183 in fig.[fig : vcvtvls ] .",
    "we give a comment on the reliable energy region of these phase shifts . through the time - dependent method ,",
    "these phase shift are obtained based on the nbs wave functions at the energy points @xmath184 mev with @xmath185 . except for these energy points and the point for @xmath186 where the value of the phase shift vanishes by definition ,",

    "( [ eq : om - decomposition ] ) do not depend on the energy . because the contribution from @xmath187 mev gradually dominates the intermediate states in @xmath188 as @xmath59 increases , the most reliable energy region of the phase shift is around @xmath189 mev .",
    "reliability for @xmath190 mev can be explicitly examined by enlarging the spatial volume .",
    "reliability for @xmath191 mev can be examined by changing relative weight of excited states , which can be done either by studying the @xmath59 dependence of the truncated potentials or by changing the two - nucleon source operator .",
    "note that these arguments apply to any choices of interpolating fields .",
    "we have made a first attempt to determine nn potentials up to nlo in the parity - odd sector , which appears in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3@xmath4 channels . using @xmath5 cp - pacs gauge configurations on a @xmath192 lattice ( @xmath193 fm and @xmath194 mev ) , not only the central and the tensor potentials but",
    "also the spin - orbit potential have been derived for the first time .",
    "these potentials are constructed from nbs wave functions for @xmath195 , which are generated by using the momentum wall sources with projections based on the representation theory of the cubic group .",
    "we have observed that the qualitative behavior of the resultant potentials agree with those of phenomenological potentials : for the spin - singlet sector , the central potential @xmath196 is repulsive with a strong repulsive core at short distance . for the spin - triplet sector , ( i ) the central potential @xmath166 is also repulsive with a repulsive core at short distance , ( ii ) the tensor potential @xmath167 is positive and quite weak , and ( iii ) the spin - orbit potential @xmath172 is negative and strong at short distance .",
    "we have then calculated scattering observables in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath4 channels , by solving schrdinger equations with these potentials .",
    "it is interesting enough that we obtain , from the first principle lattice qcd approach , attractive phase shift driven by the strongly attractive ls force in the @xmath3 channel , which has been known experimentally and has various implications in atomic nuclei and dense matter , though the magnitude of the phase shift is still small due to the large quark mass in our calculation .",
