    "a microquasar is an x - ray binary system displaying relativistic radio jets ( see review of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it consists of a compact star ( neutron star or stellar - mass blackhole ) and a mass donor star .",
    "about 20 microquasars have been identified in our galaxy to date ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are likely to be scaled - down version of radio - loud active galactic nuclei because of their morphological and physical similarities ( relativistic jet ejection and blackhole engine ) .",
    "a microquasar provides an excellent laboratory for study of mass accretion and ejection phenomena in a strong gravitational field on human timescales .",
    "their spectra extend from radio to @xmath3-rays ( e.g. @xcite ) . optical emission from microquasars",
    "are usually considered to be either thermal emission emerged from outer part of the accretion disk around the compact star ( low - mass donor case ) or stellar light of the mass donor ( high - mass case ) .",
    "however , recent observations suggest that some microquasars show synchrotron emission even at optical wavelengths in outburst phases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    optical polarimetric observation can be unique to probe microquasar systems , since we can obtain information on jets ( e.g. , geometry , magnetic field , electron energy ) from synchrotron emission or on geometrical properties of the binary system from the light scattered by circumstellar matter ( accretion disk and/or stellar wind ) in a scale not being accessible by contemporary imaging techniques .",
    "several optical polarimetric studies of microquasars have been reported for , e.g. , ls 5039 ( @xcite ) , gro j1655 - 40 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and ss 433 ( @xcite ) so far .",
    "they revealed the presence of intrinsic polarization .",
    "however , all of these studies employed broad - band filters which can not reveal how the polarization correlates with the spectral features .",
    "spectropolarimetry permits separation of the line and continuum components , providing a more accurate way to find intrinsic and interstellar components of the observed polarization .",
    "we made optical spectropolarimetric observations of the microquasar ls i + 61@xmath4 303 .",
    "this is one of be / x - ray binary systems , having a large eccentricity of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object is an optical counterpart of the variable radio source gt 0236 + 610 , which was discovered within 1@xmath6 error circle of the @xmath3-ray source 2cg 135 + 01 = 3eg j0241 + 6103 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this source exhibits radio outbursts every 26.5 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "nearly identical periodicity has been found in x - rays ( 26.42 @xmath7 0.05 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are consistent with the orbital period determined by optical and infrared observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similar periodicity has also been suggested in @xmath3-rays ( 27.4 @xmath7 7.2 days ; @xcite ) , which supports the physical connection of ls i + 61@xmath4 303 with 3eg j0241 + 6103 .",
    "recently , @xcite found very high energy @xmath3-ray emission ( above 100 gev ) showing a possible periodicity .",
    "based on the @xmath8 ultraviolet and ground - based spectroscopy , the mass donor of ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is classified as a b0ve star ( @xcite ) .",
    "long monitoring of radio flux ( @xcite ) and h@xmath1 line emissions ( @xcite ) indicated that the mass - loss rate of the be star has a period of about 4.6 yr .",
    "radio interferometric observations found that the axis of radio jet rapidly rotated in the projected sky plane ( @xcite ) , giving an s - shaped morphology like ss 433 ( @xcite ) and a ` micro - blazer ' model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is proposed for this binary .    in this paper , we examine a circumstellar structure of ls i + 61@xmath4 303 with our new spectropolarimetric data .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in  2 , and show the results in  3 .",
    "we discuss the circumstellar structure of ls i + 61@xmath4 303 in  4 .",
    "then , we summarize our study in  5 .",
    "the observations were performed on two nights in 2005 january ( epoch 1 ) and on six nights in 2005 october and november ( epoch 2 ) with a low - resolution spectropolarimeter , hbs ( @xcite ) , attached to the 1.88 m telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory , national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) .",
    "the log of the observations is shown in table [ log ] .",
    "hbs has a superachromatic half - wave plate and a quartz wollaston prism , giving a capability of measuring linear polarization in a wide range of optical region ( 4000 - 9000  ) .",
    "we employed a site 512 @xmath9 512 @xmath9 24 @xmath10 m ccd camera ( microluminetics , inc . ) with in epoch 1 and a marconi 2048 @xmath9 512 @xmath9 13.5 @xmath10 m ccd camera ( andor tech , inc . ) in epoch 2 .",
    "we used a slit of 0.2 mm width , yielding a wavelength resolution of @xmath11  .",
    "a unit of the observing sequence consists of successive integrations at 0@xmath4 , 22.5@xmath4 , 45@xmath4 and 67.5@xmath4 position angles of the half - wave plate .",
    "data reduction was performed using a standard software developed for hbs observations , hbsred ( @xcite ) . for polarimetric calibration , we used data of polarized and unpolarized standard stars ( @xcite ) , obtained with or without a fully - polarizing , glan - taylor prism .",
    "polarimetric accuracy estimated from peak - to - peak variation of unpolarized standard star data was @xmath12% over the observed wavelength range .",
    "the flux was calibrated using data of spectrophotometric standard stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ result ] shows observed polarization spectra ( degree of polarization @xmath13 and its position angle @xmath14 ) on 2005 oct 27 and nov 8 .",
    "the continuum emission exhibits rather smooth wavelength dependence over the optical region .",
    "the nightly - averaged v - band polarization data are shown in table[log ] , which indicates that there was no significant time variation in the continuum polarization over the period of our observations .",
    "figure [ ha ] shows an enlarged plot around the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "it indicates an apparent change of polarization across the h@xmath1 line , suggesting the existence of a polarization component intrinsic to ls i + 61@xmath4 303 .",
    "we discuss it in  [ isp ] .",
    "h@xmath1 emission of a be star is thought to originate mostly from equatorial disk around the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite revealed that equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath1 line in ls i + 61@xmath4 303 changes with a possible period of @xmath154.6 yr .",
    "this is considered to reflect the variation of mass - loss rate of the be star .",
    "figure [ ew_phi ] displays the mass - loss phase dependency of the ews derived from our data together with those from literature , which shows that ews of our data were commonly at low level compared with the past observations .",
    "it suggests that the disk of the be star has not developed very much and the @xmath154.6 yr periodicity is unclear during our observation .",
    "according to aavso database any significant brightness change was not reported during the period of our observation .",
    "these facts imply that the binary system was in a quiescent phase in the optical light .",
    "observed polarization is generally expressed as a vectorial sum of intrinsic polarization and interstellar polarization ( isp ) , i.e. , @xmath16 where ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are stokes parameters of the observed polarization and the intrinsic polarization , respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are degree of the isp and its position angle , respectively .",
    "isp is produced by dichroic absorption by magnetically - aligned aspherical dust grains existing between the object and the earth . to derive the intrinsic polarization",
    ", it is essentially important to know the isp component accurately .",
    "the degree of isp is well expressed by a smooth function of wavelength in optical region as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the peak polarization degree of the isp at wavelength @xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "upper - limit of @xmath26 is practically fixed by color excess , e@xmath27 , as @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath29 = 1.13 for ls i + 61@xmath4 303 , which leads to @xmath30% and a median value of @xmath31% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed polarization degree @xmath32% ( see table [ log ] ) is much smaller than the expected degree of polarization .",
    "it suggests that the isp is partly canceled out by non - zero intrinsic polarization of which the pa is nearly orthogonal to that of the isp . to confirm it",
    ", we fit the serkowski function ( eqn .",
    "[ serkowski - law ] ) to the observed polarization data and derived the isp parameters .",
    "figure [ whittet ] shows the obtained @xmath33 and @xmath25 values , together with the @xmath33-@xmath25 relation derived by @xcite , @xmath34 this figure shows that most of our data points detach from the linear @xmath33-@xmath25 relation , which is also consistent with the idea that the observed polarization has a substantial intrinsic component .",
    "to evaluate the isp component , we used the change of polarization across the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "line emission generally emerges from optically - thin regions and is subject to less scattering than continuum emission .",
    "this leads to a lower polarization level in the line emission than in the continuum emission .",
    "in the case of ls i + 61@xmath0 303 , the line emission is thought to arise from ionized gas of the be disk . without a few exceptions , we can consider that the line emission in be stars should show little or no polarization ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", we assume that the polarization of the line component practically represents the isp .",
    "to subtract the continuum component from the polarization at h@xmath1 emission line ( denoted by suffix ` em ' ) , we used its neighboring continuum polarization on both sides of the line ( ` con1 ' and ` con2 ' ) .",
    "we derive stokes parameters @xmath35 of the line emission as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the band width of each component ( em , con1 and con2 ) .",
    "we set all @xmath37 to be 150 and the central wavelength of the h@xmath1 emission band to be 6563  .",
    "there is no significant line component in those bands except for the h@xmath1 line .",
    "we calculate the polarization degree and pa as @xmath38 the derived h@xmath1 polarization is shown in table[log ] .",
    "weighted - mean and standard deviation of all the eight nights data are @xmath39=2.16 @xmath7 0.20% and @xmath40=126.4@xmath4 @xmath7 4.5@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the polarization of the field stars within 3 degree ( 4.3 @xmath7 1.1 % , 112 @xmath7 7@xmath4 ; @xcite )",
    ". since pa of the isp is almost constant with wavelength , we consider that @xmath40 represents @xmath22 . to derive the spectrum of the intrinsically polarized component , we should know the wavelength dependence of degree of the isp , further .",
    "once @xmath25 is fixed , the remaining isp parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath26 , are calculated from equations ( [ serkowski - law ] ) , ( [ w ] ) and the derived @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite indicated that isp has a peak polarization at @xmath15 5400 @xmath7 600 in the case of @xmath42 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath25 is 5000  , 5500  , or 6000  , and calculate the intrinsic polarization .",
    "figure [ intp ] shows the spectra of the intrinsic polarization for different @xmath25 .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarization is closely similar to those of typical be stars , e.g. @xmath43 tau ( @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization of be stars is explained by the result of thomson scattering in their equatorial disks .",
    "if there is only one polarizing component ( e.g. a single disk ) , the pa of the intrinsic polarization @xmath44 should be constant against wavelength .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for most be stars .",
    "the derived @xmath44 becomes rather flat for @xmath25 , suggesting that the assumptions of the range of @xmath25 and the be star - origin polarization are self - consistent .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the origin of the intrinsic polarization is predominantly thomson scattering in the be star .",
    "neither @xmath44 nor the ew of the h@xmath1 line do show temporal variation , which suggests that the be equatorial disk is nearly stable during the period of our observation .",
    "@xmath45 implies that the pa of the be disk is @xmath15 115@xmath4 ( pa of polarization is perpendicular to the scattering plane defined by the light source , the scatterer , and the observer ) and the rotational axis of the be star is at pa @xmath15 25@xmath4 .",
    "as noted in  1 , radio jets have been found in ls i + 61@xmath4 303 .",
    "table [ pastjet ] shows pa s of the radio jets in literature .",
    "the directions of the jets seem to be biased around pa@xmath15120@xmath4 during quiescent phases .",
    "if we can assume that the radio jets are perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disk around the compact object , the pa of the semi - major axis of the accretion disk on the projected sky would be @xmath1530@xmath4 .",
    "no x - ray pulsation ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests that the compact star is not strongly - magnetized and such an orthogonal disk - jet geometry can be assumed .",
    "we also consider that the plane of the accretion disk represents the orbital plane of the binary system .",
    "thus , we propose a geometrical model in which the rotational axis of the be star is almost perpendicular to the orbital plane as shown in figure [ matome ] .",
    "considering an evolution of a typical binary system whose member stars were born in a same molecular cloud , our geometrical model seems to be quite peculiar .",
    "however , a similar geometry has been reported in another be / x - ray binary system , psr b 1259 - 63 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they suggested that the be equatorial disk is considerably tilted with respect to the orbital plane , and @xcite suggested that the tilt angle is about 70@xmath0 . these studies may support our picture for ls i + 61@xmath4 303 .",
    "we will discuss possible origin of this peculiar topology in  [ peculiar ] .      considering a light scattering model derived by @xcite , we can estimate the inclination angle @xmath46 of the rotational axis of the be disk against the line of sight . the expected degree of the polarization is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a degree of polarization , @xmath49 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath10 is cos @xmath50 and @xmath50 is a polar angle against the rotational axis of the be star .",

    "the accretion rate during the passage through the equatorial disk at @xmath15 3@xmath54 ( @xmath92 ) is @xmath15 8 @xmath9 10@xmath91 yr@xmath68 and the spherical wind at the same passage ( @xmath93 ) is @xmath15 7 @xmath9 10@xmath94 yr@xmath68 .",

    "but , the large difference in @xmath97 would lead to sudden changes of accretion properties and the resultant mass ejection .",
    "such an impulsive change gives a hint on the formation and the precession of the radio jet .",
    "however , the launch of the precessing jet occurred at @xmath84 @xmath15 0.7 , largely apart from the periastron @xmath84 @xmath74 0.23 .",
    "it has been known that both the radio and x - ray emission modulate with the orbital phase ( @xcite and references therein ) and that there is a significant offset between their peaks ( @xmath98 @xmath15 0.4 - 0.5 ) .",
    "the radio peaks are distributed over a wide phase interval of about 0.45 - 0.95 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that x - ray emission is produced by inverse compton scattering of stellar photons by relativistic electrons produced at the shock interaction of the relativistic between jet and be star wind near the periastron , and the synchrotron radio emission would then arise from the expansion of the plasma around the apoastron passage .",

    "@xcite suggested that the past supernova explosion in ls i + 61@xmath4 303 ( which produced the compact object ) should be asymmetric to kick the compact object up to the highly eccentric ( @xmath75 @xmath74 0.7 ) orbit .",

    "<S> we present optical linear spectropolarimetry of the microquasar ls i + 61@xmath0 303 . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum emission is mildly polarized ( up to 1.3 % ) and shows almost no temporal change . </S>",
    "<S> we find a distinct change of polarization across the h@xmath1 emission line , indicating the existence of polarization component intrinsic to the microquasar . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the interstellar polarization ( isp ) component from polarization of the h@xmath1 line and derive the intrinsic polarization component . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic component is well explained by thomson scattering in equatorial disk of the be - type mass donor . the position angle ( pa ) of the intrinsic polarization @xmath2 represents the rotational axis of the be disk . </S>",
    "<S> this pa is nearly perpendicular to the pa of the radio jet found during quiescent phases . </S>",
    "<S> assuming an orthogonal disk - jet geometry around the compact star , the rotational axis of the accretion disk is almost perpendicular to that of the be disk . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , according to the orbital parameters of the microquasar , the compact star is likely to get across the be disk around their periastron passage . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the peculiar circumstellar structure of this microquasar inferred from our observation and possible connection with its high - energy activities . </S>"
