    "in metallic ferromagnet - nonferromagnet - ferromagnet multilayers ( see fig . 1 ) magnetic structure oscillates between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orientations of the ferromagnets magnetizations as a function of thickness of nonmagnetic metal @xmath0 with a period of order of the fermi wave length @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon is based on the fact that the interlayer coupling is due to ruderman - kittel interaction between electron spins in different ferromagnets .",
