    "when a sheet of stiff paper is crumpled into a compact ball , creases and folds appear .",
    "this storage of energy , especially in the irreversibly distorted creases , has been widely studied , for instance in [ 14 ] .",
    "our interest here is in geometric changes associated with the ( reversible ) folds , which is less well understood .",
    "see for instance [ 5,6 ] .",
    "consider the densest possible state of the material , in which the sheet is carefully folded into a compact stack of parallel leaves .",
    "( there needs to be a significant cost for bending the material or else dense packings will usually be more complicated . )",
    "imagine the process of compactifying the sheet within a contracting sphere , from a typical initial state of low volume fraction near 0 to a typical state of high volume fraction near 1 .",
    "how would such a process proceed ? for a material in thermal equilibrium there is a pair of first order phase transitions associated with quasistatic compactification ; low density configurations are of random character ( fluid ) , while high density configurations are ordered ( solid ) , and isothermal compactification would progress between these extremes via freezing and then melting transitions , separated by phase coexistence in which the material consists of macroscopic portions of each phase .",
    "our computations , in a toy model , suggest that compactification of a stiff sheet undergoes a similar path , at least from its low volume fraction disordered state to a reorganization of the state into an inhomogeneous intermediary ( part random and part folded ) , as is typical of freezing .",
    "our toy model is not of a thin , stiff sheet in three dimensions but of a thin , stiff wire loop in two dimensions , which we expect to behave similarly [ 7 ] .",
    "( confined wire in three dimensions may well behave differently ; see for instance [ 8 ] . ) in the model the wire is restricted to a triangular lattice , so a configuration in the model is a self - avoiding closed walk ( loop ) on the lattice , with energies associated to bends in the walk to penalize the bends .",

    "for a fixed integer @xmath0 consider the triangular lattice @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions . note that this space is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of oriented self - avoiding closed walks on @xmath3 , its elements being called _",
    "configurations_. if a walk @xmath4 changes direction at a vertex , we say there is a bend there",
    ". if it changes by @xmath5 , we call the bend large ; if it changes by @xmath6 we call it small .",
    "we define @xmath7 as the number of small bends in @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the number of large bends in @xmath8 . assigning the energy @xmath10 to each small bend and @xmath11 to each large bend ,",
    "we define the total energy of configuration @xmath8 by : @xmath12 and denote the model with energy parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 by @xmath13 .    because it is harder to simulate our model at fixed density and/or fixed energy , we use conjugate variables @xmath14 for energy @xmath15 and @xmath16 for particle ( edge ) number @xmath17 , assigning the probability @xmath18 for any @xmath4 : @xmath19}}{z},\\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the normalization .",
    "( we suppress dependence on the system size . )",
    "we take @xmath21 without loss of generality , so that the variable parameters in our model are @xmath16 and the energies of the two bending angles , @xmath11 and @xmath10 . we have simulated @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with qualitatively similar results ; here we state results only for @xmath22 .",
    "to simulate the @xmath22 model at @xmath16-values @xmath24 , we start with @xmath25 and a configuration which is a cycle with @xmath26 edges .",
    "the end configuration in the simulation of @xmath27 is taken as the starting configuration in the simulation of @xmath28 .",
    "the basic monte carlo step is : pick at random either an edge @xmath29 or a pair of intersecting edges @xmath30 , and then replace @xmath29 with a pair of intersecting edges @xmath31 , or replace @xmath30 with an edge @xmath32 , with probabilities determined by @xmath33 , such that the resulting configuration is legal ( i.e. is a self - avoiding closed loop ) .    for each measurement",
    "@xmath34 we use a standard autocorrelation function to find a `` mixing time '' at each @xmath27 , which we define as the smallest value of @xmath35 such that the autocorrelation @xmath36 falls below zero . here",
    "@xmath37 is the monte carlo chain corresponding to the simulation of @xmath27 , and @xmath16 and @xmath38 are the ( sample ) average and variance of @xmath34 over that chain .",
    "we found that for each of our measurements @xmath34 ( described below ) , our simulations of each @xmath27 were on average at least 20 times as long as the corresponding mixing times .",
    "we therefore believe our simulations are in equilibrium at each @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain error bars from the student s @xmath35-distribution by running @xmath39 independent copies of the simulation .",
    "we make the following measurements to detect the spontaneous symmetry breaking and layering which may occur at large @xmath16 .",
    "we first consider a correlation measurement @xmath40 : choose a random edge in @xmath8 and define @xmath41 as the proportion of edges in @xmath8 which are parallel to it . since the model is isotropic we expect @xmath42 to be identically @xmath43 for small @xmath16 in the infinite volume limit .    to detect bulk - sized layers ,",
    "that is , layers proportional to the size of the system , we define @xmath44 as the size of the largest @xmath45 perfect square `` layer '' centered at the origin in @xmath8 , divided by the system size .",
    "( perfect means no bends . )",
    "we expect that for small @xmath16 , @xmath46 is identically zero in the infinite volume limit .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath45 is rather arbitrary ; any percentage significantly above @xmath47 should detect bulk layers .",
    "[ fig3 ]    = 6.5truein    the data gives strong evidence of a phase transition , namely that in the infinite volume limit @xmath42 is identically @xmath43 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "see figure 1a , with error bars in the inset .",
    "the data in figure 1 are performed on systems of volume : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    as further detail of the nature of the ordered phase signalled by @xmath54",
    ", the data displayed in figure 1b , computed in the same family of simulations , suggests that in the infinite volume limit @xmath46 is identically zero below @xmath55 , but positive above @xmath55 , showing the emergence of bulk layers above @xmath55 .",
    "the transition can be seen in configuration snapshots ; see figure 2 .",
    "we also measure volume fraction , @xmath56 .",
    "the data in figure 3 suggests that in the infinite volume limit a discontinuity develops in the slope of @xmath56 at @xmath55 , in accord with the other evidence of a transition .",
    "we have introduced and simulated a toy model for the folding of progressively confined stiff sheets .",
    "we find that bulk folding emerges at a sharp volume fraction as the material is compacted , just as bulk solids form at a sharp volume fraction in the freezing transition of equilibrium fluids .",
    "this analogy has previously been used to model the behavior of other types of soft matter , in particular colloids [ 9 ] and the random close packing of granular matter [ 10,11 ] .",
    "we note an old model due to flory [ 12 ] which has been applied to crumpled materials ; see [ 13 ] and references therein .",
    "in that two dimensional lattice model one varies the temperature with volume fraction fixed at one .",
    "there is general agreement that it exhibits a phase transition , perhaps representing the melting of a dense ordered phase .",
    "this melting transition is usually characterized as continuous ( second order ) , though this is sometimes disputed [ 13 ] .",
    "the phase transition we find in our model should be experimentally verifiable , in both compacted stiff sheets and in two dimensionally confined compacted stiff wires .",
