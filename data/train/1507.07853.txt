    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the iron pnictide system  @xcite , refeaso ( re : rare earth ) doped by chemical substitution on the re or in the o site  @xcite , at temperatures between 40 k and 55 k and with critical fields of 65 t at 4 k , a large quantity of studies was devoted to these fe - based superconductors . among them , it was shown  @xcite the existence of a related family of superconductors , the iron chalcogenides , corresponding to fese and fete and their partial substitutions fete@xmath9se@xmath2 . this system has the simplest structure among the fe - based superconductors because it is formed just with two layers of fe and se / te , with an anti - pbo structure ( space group p4/nmm )  @xcite .",
    "the fete compound exhibits antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering below @xmath1070 k and no superconducting state  @xcite down to 4 k. by partial substitution of te by se or by s , the af order is suppressed and superconductivity develops  @xcite at critical temperatures @xmath11 8 k - 14 k. on the other hand , fese is a superconductor and the partial substitution of se by s initially favors superconductivity , while for replacements over a 20% superconductivity is depressed  @xcite . up to now",
    ", studies of the influence of disorder on the properties of iron chalcogenides were particularly devoted to substitutions into the fe - site  @xcite . here , in order to gain insight on the influence of structural parameters on the normal state properties and on the appearance of the superconducting state on these fe - based chalcogenide superconductors , we have synthesized new ceramic samples , performing partial substitutions of te in the fete compound by both se and s , corresponding to fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2s@xmath3 ( ftses ) .",
    "the se and s concentrations were chosen in order to maintain nearly constant the ionic radius while producing a small increase of the structural disorder in the chalcogenide site .    in the present work ,",
    "we particularly report on the synthesis and structural characterization of the ftses ceramic samples and on their magnetic , transport and superconducting properties .",
    "we found that the structural disorder of the chalcogenide site ( @xmath12 ) influences the transport properties , determining a 3d - variable range hopping conduction - regime observed for temperatures @xmath6 200 k , with an electronic localization length ( @xmath7 ) that decreases concomitantly with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "we found a marked reduction of @xmath13 for the sample where @xmath7 becomes lower that the coherence length ( @xmath8 ) , indicating the sensibility of the superconducting state to nonmagnetic disorder .",
    "we have synthesized , by solid - state reaction , the family of ftses ceramics compounds , with nominal compositions z=0 and ( x , y ) = ( 0 , 0.12 ) ; ( 0.10 , 0.10 ) ; ( 0.25 , 0.06 ) ; ( 0.30 , 0.05 ) ; ( 0.40 , 0.02 ) ; ( 0.45 , 0.01 ) and ( 0.50 , 0 ) . the x and y values were chosen in order to produce a small variation of the average chalcogenide ionic radius ( @xmath14 , where the @xmath15 are the fractional occupancies of each chalcogenide and @xmath16 their ionic radius ) while increasing the random disorder associated with their different ionic radius .",
    "to vary this disorder , we use different te , se and s combinations in order to modify the standard deviation @xmath17 and @xmath18 was chosen around ( 2.12 @xmath19 0.04 )  . as the starting materials",

    "were labeled s01 to s07 , respectively .",
    "the materials were ground , pelletized and encapsulated in a quartz tube in vacuum .",
    "then , the samples were heated at 750 @xmath20c for over 24 hours and slowly cooled down to room temperature .",
    "we repeated the heat treatments again and finally , we resintered the samples in a rectangular shape at 750 @xmath20c but reducing time to 12 hours .",
    "samples were characterized by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) using a cuk@xmath21 radiation with a panalytical empyrean model diffractometer with pixcel 3d detector .",
    "a complete rietveld refinement was done with full prof program  @xcite .",
    "mssbauer spectra of the s07 sample were obtained at room temperature ( rt ) and 20 k with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer in transmission geometry with a @xmath22co / rh source .",
    "measurements were recorded at 4 mm / s and 11 mm / s and then fitted using the normos program  @xcite .",
    "isomer shift values are given relative to that of @xmath21-fe at rt .",
    "a quantitative point analysis was performed by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) coupled with a scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .",
    "all the samples were polished before the measurements .",
    "we made several measurements on the whole surface and then we averaged to obtain a more realistic value of content of each sample .",
    "electrical resistivity measurements as a function of temperature ( 4 k @xmath5 t @xmath5 300k ) were performed by a four - point method .",
    "magnetization as a function of temperature and hysteresis loops were achieved using a squid magnetometer .",

    "a dominant broad doublet showed up and a minor content of impurity magnetic phases seemed to be hidden in the background .",
    "in order to allow a better resolution of the paramagnetic hyperfine splitting , an additional spectrum was recorded at 4 mm / s , in which two main paramagnetic components are clearly distinguished ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moss]a ) .",

    "the other one instead has an isomer shift of   0.26 mm / s and a quadrupole splitting of   0.78 mm / s .",
    "this last subspectrum with fe@xmath27 character could be due to a superparamagnetic contribution of impurity phases with particle sizes typically smaller than 10 nm .",
    "those parameters were then fixed in the spectrum recorded at rt and 11 mm / s , to take into account only the minor magnetic component .",
    "for that purpose a fitting with a hyperfine field distribution for the higher fields ( @xmath28 10 t ) was performed ( see fig .  [",

    "an appropriate identification required another spectrum recorded at low temperature and 11 mm / s . in this case , to ensure a temperature below any possible transition , 20 k was chosen .",
    "the corresponding hyperfine field distribution is also shown in fig .  [",

    "the area under the magnetic part of the spectrum slightly increased when lowering temperature , confirming that as it was supposed above in the text , the minor doublet contribution at rt arose from superparamagnetic impurities .",
    "based on the whole analysis , including rt measurements in wide and narrow velocity ranges and at low temperature , it can be concluded that one of the impurity phases is magnetite ( fe@xmath30o@xmath31 ) ; distinguished on cooling due to the verwey transition  @xcite .",
    "considering the recoilless factor of fe@xmath30o@xmath31 at rt , reported in @xcite , the effective fraction of magnetite in the sample would not exceed 3% .",
    "the other one , a low field contribution to the hyperfine distribution at rt which evolves to higher fields as lowering temperature , would agree with the spin reorientation corresponding to fe@xmath24se@xmath25 .  @xcite this impurity fraction represents about 10% of the iron bearing compounds in the sample .",
    "these results do not contradict the xrd measurements in which fe@xmath24se@xmath25 with a similar fraction was detected .",

    "to summarize , we have synthesized a new family of superconducting samples with different degrees of disorder on the chalcogenide site by partially replacing te by both se and s in the fete compound .",

    "these usual impurities obtained in the synthesis of the ftse compound@xcite produce a ferromagnetic background , an anomaly near 125 k , corresponding to the verwey transition of magnetite , and an hysteretic behavior in the 150 k to 300 k range probably associated with the ferrimagnetic nature of fe@xmath24se@xmath25 .",
