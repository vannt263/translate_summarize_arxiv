    "up to now , various holographic approaches to the @xmath5 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory with strong coupling have been performed from the dual supergravity viewpoint ; cf .",
    "@xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "the research has been extended to the sym theory in the background of ds@xmath6 ( ads@xmath7 by introducing the 4d cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) ; cf . @xcite . in this way it has been found that the dynamics of the sym theory is controlled by the 4d geometry , especially for the ds@xmath6 and ads@xmath6 cases ; cf . @xcite . in this kind of theory",
    ", the 4d geometries in cosmology are used .",
    "now , one might use the results of this holographic sym to solve the field equations in 4d cosmology .",
    "a characteristic properties of such a method is that it is equivalent to investigating the back reaction from sym theory on 4d cosmology .",
    "we intend to analyze this topic in a later work . in the present paper",
    "we will however focus attention on another , though related aspect of the problem , namely brane world cosmology in the early universe .",
    "specifically , we will consider the randall - sundrum theory for a single brane situated in ads@xmath9 bulk space , and concentrate on the lepton era for which the temperature drops from about @xmath0k ( muon pair annihilation ) to about @xmath1k ( electron - positron pair annihilation ) .",
    "the universe is then filled with electrons , three types of neutrinos , the corresponding antiparticles , and photons ; cf . @xcite .    a key reference for us will be the work of @xcite , dealing with the first order quark - gluon phase transition in brane - world cosmology",
    ". we will generalize their analysis by taking into account the _ bulk viscosity _ in the cosmic fluid . that such an investigation is natural to undertake , follows from the fact that the viscosity coefficients ( @xmath10 for the shear viscosity , @xmath11 for the bulk viscosity ) in the plasma era are very large .",
    "at least nominally , this is so .",
    "in particular , it is evident for the shear viscosity : under ordinary laboratory circumstances @xmath10 is of order @xmath12 ( water ) , but in the beginning of the lepton era it is a factor of about @xmath13 larger ; cf .",
    "@xcite . also , for the bulk viscosity the difference is very high ( a factor of about @xmath14 larger ) .",
    "of course , a main reason for these big numbers is that the energy densities are so high in the early universe . to see the actual influence from viscosity",
    ", one has to carry out the calculations explicitly .    in the next section we first present the general formalism for 5d viscous brane theory ,",
    "discuss the temperature and the duration of the first order transition , and consider thereafter three different options for how to model the bulk viscosity .",
    "our preferred choice is the expression for @xmath15 calculated from kinetic theory .",
    "using it , we find that at the highest temperatures in the plasma era the influence from friction is completely negligible . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "the influence from @xmath15 may amount to a few per cent .",
    "the general relationship between temperature @xmath16 and time @xmath17 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) below , for the post - transitional period where the fluid has entered the hadron phase .    as usual in cosmology",
    ", we will for the most part ignore the shear viscosity ; this being in accordance with the common assumption about spatial isotropy in the cosmic fluid . in recent times",
    "there has been an increased interest in anisotropic cosmology , however , for a large part due to observations .",
    "an anisotropic universe immediately brings the shear viscosity into play . in the final section we consider , as a typical example , the anisotropic kasner universe , calculating the production of specific entropy .",
    "it turns out that on _ both _ viscosity coefficients , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , contribute , and it is possible to relate the rate of entropy to the anisotropy parameter , usually called @xmath18 , in the universe .",
    "we find that at the highest temperatures the value of @xmath18 necessary to make @xmath11 and @xmath10 of the same degree of importance , is immensely small . at the lowest temperatures , however",
    ", a value of @xmath4 will cause the two viscosity coefficients to be about equally important for the entropy production .",
    "it should be mentioned that we neglect the viscosity of _ dark radiation .",
    "_ very little seems to be known about such a viscosity , if it exists at all .",
    "as mentioned above , we shall consider one single brane situated in five - dimensional ass@xmath9 bulk space .",
    "this is the randall - sundrum ii model ; cf .",
    "@xcite , when the fluid on the brane has a bulk viscosity @xmath11 .",
    "we shall omit the ds@xmath9 case .",
    "we begin by recapitulating some essentials of this theory , as were spelled out in @xcite ( cf . also the related @xcite ) .",
    "let the brane be located at @xmath19 , the surrounding bulk being empty except from the 5d cosmological constant @xmath20 .",
    "the metric is taken to have the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are determined by einstein s equations @xmath25 the coordinates are @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the five - dimensional gravitational coupling .",
    "einstein s equations are given in the references mentioned above , and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the form of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 is not so far specified , but as the 5d space outside the brane is assumed empty the components of @xmath28 are different from zero only on the brane .    on the brane ( subscript zero )",

    "for simplicity we use the notation @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    imposing the gauge condition @xmath39 on the boundary we get @xmath40 .",
    "the shear viscosity , as mentioned , can be omitted when we assume spatial isotropy of the fluid .",
    "we shall work in the orthonormal frame where @xmath41 .",
    "the metric on the brane becomes thus @xmath42    we have to consider the junction conditions across the brane ( overdots and primes meaning derivatives with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath43 respectively ) .",

    "similar expressions hold for @xmath49 . assuming that there is no flux of energy in the @xmath43 direction ( @xmath50 ) , one derives as a consequence that @xmath51 from the field equations we find , by integration over @xmath43 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an integration constant . on the brane @xmath19",
    "this implies @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the effective 4d cosmological constant , @xmath56 ( note that as @xmath29 is constant , so is @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is to be observed that @xmath55 contains the 5d cosmological constant @xmath20 as well as the tension @xmath29 on the brane .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) does not contain the viscosity explicitly .",
    "we ought here to point out that the brane equation ( [ 8 ] ) is formally similar to the corresponding equation in holographic cosmology ; the subscript zero in that case to be associated with the ads boundary instead of with the brane position @xmath19 . as already mentioned , we intend to return to this correspondence in a later work .",
    "let us turn to the energy conservation equation in the presence of bulk viscosity , @xmath57 here the junction condition for @xmath49 is taken into account ; cf .",
    "this equation is the same as obtained in ordinary 4d viscous cosmology ; this may appear somewhat surprising as there is no obvious reason why it should be so .",

    "( to see the correspondence one needs to note that the relationship between the 4d and 5d gravitational couplings is @xmath66 ) .",
    "we will now investigate how the relationship between cosmic time @xmath17 and temperature @xmath16 becomes influenced by the bulk viscosity , both before the phase transition , and after it .",
    "it is helpful first to give some data of the transition ; cf .",

    "we can calculate the duration @xmath77 of the transition by making use of the formalism of ref .",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath78s , when the brane tension @xmath29 is taken to have the typical value @xmath79 this value of @xmath80 is relatively large .",
    "the physical reason why the new phase does not turn up immediately is that , as a characteristic property of a first order transition , some supercooling is needed to overcome the energy expense in forming the new phase .",
    "( note : the viscosity is not included in this calculation of @xmath80 . )",
    "let us next consider the equation of state for the fluid . in the initial quark phase we write it in the form @xmath81 where ; cf .",

    "there exist also two temperature corrections to eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) , one term proportional to @xmath87 and the other proportional to , but they are expected to be small and will be neglected here for simplicity .",
    "we now need to model the bulk viscosity @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this can be done in various ways . to begin with",
    ", we might follow the ansatz of murphy in his classic paper on viscous cosmology ( @xcite ) , and assume the `` kinematic viscosity '' @xmath88 to be a constant . near the big bang where @xmath89 is large the same",
    "should accordingly hold for @xmath11 ; thereafter @xmath11 is predicted to decrease with time .",
    "this is however the opposite of the behavior one calculates from relativistic kinetic theory . so murphy s ansatz seems to overpredict the influence from viscosity in this era of the universe s history .    as a second option",
    ", we might assume the kinematic viscosity to be inversely proportional to @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this ansatz was actually made use of in @xcite .",
    "an advantage of it was that the mathematical handling of the hydrodynamic formalism was found to be quite simple .",
    "as in the present case the bag constant is not expected to have any influence on the viscosity , we can omit @xmath85 in the expression ( [ 14 ] ) for @xmath92 and substitute only the thermal part @xmath93 to get for the quark fluid @xmath94 with @xmath95 a nondimensional constant ( the factor 4/9 is introduced for convenience ) .",
    "since @xmath96 from eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , inserting eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) for @xmath11 , an equation for @xmath97 that can be manipulated to give the temperature dependence of the scale factor in a simple form , @xmath98 the asterisk meaning a reference value , corresponding formally to the temperature when @xmath99 .",
    "if the fluid is nonviscous , @xmath100 , one gets @xmath101 , in accordance with @xcite , eq .",
    "( 20 ) . for a given value of the scale factor @xmath61 on the boundary @xmath19 , the temperature in the viscous case becomes thus modified by a factor @xmath102 .",
    "let us explore the consequences of the ansatz ( [ 15 ] ) one step further , by evaluating what correspondence between temperature and time it actually predicts . for definiteness we chose an initial time @xmath17 prior to the transition temperature @xmath103 ( quark - gluon era ) .",
    "we then have to go back to eq .",

    "we then get @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xmath109^{1/2}. \\label{18}\\ ] ] the viscosity thus occurs in the prefactor @xmath110 in the integral ( [ 17 ] ) , and in the spatial curvature term ( @xmath111 ) as well as in the dark radiation term ( @xmath53 ) in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) .    on physical grounds",
    "it is however of interest to ask : can we say something about the connection between the ansatz ( [ 15 ] ) and general expressions for bulk viscosity in hydrodynamics ?",
    "let us recall in this context the following formula , derived for photons , @xmath112 ^ 2 , \\label{19}\\ ] ] in which @xmath113 denotes the mean free time .",
    "this formula is attributed to @xcite , and is given also in the review article by @xcite .",
    "the formula gives us the following physical insight : its first ( leading ) term corresponds to the ansatz ( [ 15 ] ) _ only if @xmath114 .",
    "_    in view of this restriction it is perhaps not so unexpected after all that the ansatz ( [ 15 ] ) does not appear to be possessed by the cosmic fluid in the very early universe",
    ". kinetic theory calculations - which we shall in the following consider as the most reliable ones - indicate that at these high temperatures the value of @xmath95 is not a constant but is instead a function that varies strongly with temperature .",
    "it might well right that the ansatz ( [ 15 ] ) is a good one at later stages of the universe s history , but we will further abandon this form in this paper .",
    "so , as our third and final option , we will henceforth simply adopt the results from kinetic theory to the first order in inverse temperature as given by @xcite : @xmath115 ( cgs units ) .",
    "also , we will henceforth focus on late part of the plasma era , which is the only part of it where viscosity seems to be of physical importance at all .",
    "assume now temperatures @xmath116k , when the fluid is in the hadronic region .",
    "the energy density is then @xmath117 .",
    "we write @xmath118 in the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the radiation energy constant , and @xmath121 .",
    "equation ( [ 10 ] ) now reads @xmath122 which can be rewritten as ( @xmath123 ) @xmath124 it is of interest to evaluate the ratio between the last two terms in this equation . calling the ratio @xmath125",
    ", we get @xmath126 this expression is useful , since it shows the very high sensitivity of the viscosity with respect to temperature , and also gives a realistic estimate of the magnitude of the viscosity effect .",
    "we do not need to solve the full problem in order to estimate the magnitude of this ; we may only use the known expressions for the radiation dominated universe : @xmath127 according to which @xmath128s when @xmath129k .",
    "then @xmath130 , and so @xmath131 at this temperature .",
    "this the order of magnitude of viscosity correction that we may expect .",
    "if we stretch the expansion ( [ 20 ] ) to the lower limit of the plasma era , @xmath132k @xmath133 , we will get @xmath134 .",
    "these numbers are not quite negligible , and indicate that we ought to treat eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) a bit further .",
    "we follow this up by first writing eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) as @xmath135 where we have made use of eqs .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) to express the viscous term as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the constant @xmath136 is @xmath137 in cgs units .",
    "this equation can be integrated with respect to @xmath17 , from the chosen initial instant @xmath128s to an arbitrary higher value of @xmath17 at least roughly compatible with the approximation ( [ 20 ] ) . at the initial point",
    "we moreover assume the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) , and we define for simplicity @xmath138 in order to comply with the notation used earlier .",
    "we then get from eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 ( it is helpful to note that @xmath141 as @xmath142 in the integration domain , we thus see that @xmath143 and @xmath144 becomes slightly smaller than in the nonviscous case .    with eq .",

    "we will abstain from this , in view of the smallness of the effect .",
    "our main purpose has been to give the general method for how to calculate the influence from viscosity ; the method of course works also when the viscosity is greater than in the present case .",
    "one has only to adjust input formula ( [ 20 ] ) for the viscosity appropriately .    of obvious physical interest",
    "is however to consider the magnitude of the nonlinear @xmath149 ) term as compared with the linear term in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , under the present circumstances .",
    "calling the ratio @xmath150 , we see that @xmath151 .",
    "thus with the same value for the brane tension as used above , @xmath152 , we see that in the quark era @xmath153 whereas in the hadron era @xmath154 thus , the influence from nonlinearity decreases from 5% to about 1% during the plasma era .",
    "we have so far considered the bulk viscosity @xmath11 only . as is known , the shear viscosity @xmath10 is usually omitted in cosmology because of the assumed spatial isotropy of the cosmic fluid . in later years the shear viscosity concept has however attracted increased attention , because of its importance in different areas of physics .",
    "thus , one may notice that in the modeling of elementary particles this concept plays an essential role in connection with the suggestion about the existence of a universal lower bound on the ratio @xmath155 , @xmath156 being the entropy content per unit volume ( cf .",
    ", for instance , the classic paper by @xcite ) . in geometric units",
    "the proposed inequality takes the simple form @xmath157 there have later appeared several other papers in this and similar areas ; some examples are @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "let us give a bit of the formalism .",
    "the fluid s energy - momentum tensor is @xmath158 where @xmath35 is the projection tensor , @xmath159 the scalar expansion , and @xmath160 with @xmath161 the shear stress tensor .    in principle",
    ", all the kinetic coefficients can , via the kubo relations , be expressed as correlation functions of the corresponding currents .",
    "for the fourier component @xmath162 of @xmath10 the correlator is the stress tensor , @xmath163\\rangle ; \\label{40}\\ ] ] ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "our question is now : is the shear viscosity important in the early universe ?",
    "it is here worth noticing that increasing attention is actually being paid to this kind of cosmology .",
    "part of the reason for this has its roots in observations .",
    "recent wmap measurements indicate that the quadrupole and the octupole are aligned and concentrated in a plane about @xmath164 to the galactic plane , suggesting that there is an asymmetric expansion with one direction expanding differently from the other two directions ( see , for instance , @xcite with further references therein ) .",
    "it seems therefore worthwhile to investigate this case in some detail .",
    "we will take the anisotropic kasner universe as a typical example , corresponding to the metric @xmath165 the numbers @xmath166 being constants .",
    "one can introduce two numbers @xmath167 and @xmath168 here , defined as @xmath169 . in the usual kasner theory for a vacuum , one has @xmath170 .",
    "this simple property no longer holds when the cosmic fluid possesses an energy density @xmath89 , pressure @xmath171 , and viscosity coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 , all of which are depending on time .",
    "the following theoretical description of this situation is essentially extracted from @xcite . from einstein s equations , taking @xmath172 , it is easy to obtain the following time - dependent solution @xmath173 @xmath174 where @xmath175 refer to some some chosen initial instant @xmath176 .",
    "the einstein equations then take the following convenient form involving time - independent quantities only , @xmath177 @xmath178 ( recall that @xmath179 in the present notation ) . from these equations @xmath167 and @xmath168 can be found , once the @xmath180 are known .",
    "we can now easily calculate the rate of entropy production .",
    "the average expansion anisotropy parameter is defined as @xmath181 where @xmath182 with @xmath183 , @xmath184 being the average hubble factor .",
    "this means that @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath185 .",
    "the entropy four - current is @xmath186 , with @xmath49 the baryon number density and @xmath187 the nondimensional entropy per baryon . in the comoving frame of reference",
    "the rate of entropy production is thus @xmath188 this simple relationship enables us to determine the amount of anisotropy in the plasma era for which the shear and bulk viscosity are of the same importance . from eq .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) we have for this case @xmath189 from the tabular data given in @xcite we have at @xmath190k ( cgs units ) : @xmath191 , leading to @xmath192 , an immensely small number . at the lower end of the era , for @xmath132k , we have @xmath193 , implying @xmath194 .",
    "there is thus a very large difference between the two cases as regards influence upon entropy production ; the anisotropy parameter having to be much higher at the lowest temperatures in order to make the influence from @xmath10 appreciable .",
    "our analysis has been restricted to the plasma era only , i.e. , the period for which the temperature drops from about @xmath0k to @xmath1k . in the earlier parts of this era we have found that the bulk viscosity @xmath11 plays a negligible role . that includes the first order quark - gluon phase transition occurring at about @xmath0k .",
    "in the later part of the era , the influence from viscosity may be discernible , a few per cent typically . our analysis has been based upon the value for @xmath15 calculated from kinetic theory , to the first order in the inverse temperature expansion ; cf .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) determine the relationship between temperature @xmath195 and time @xmath17 , at times after the phase transition .",
    "although the magnitudes of the calculated viscosity corrections in the situation considered here are numerically small , the mathematical procedure as such is general , and may be applicable for other eras in the universe s history for which the effect can be greater .",
    "once anisotropies in the geometry of the universe are incorporated , the shear viscosity @xmath10 also comes into play .",
    "section 3 discusses the kasner universe as an example .",
    "equation ( [ 47 ] ) shows the magnitude of the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 for which @xmath11 and @xmath10 are of similar importance for the local entropy production .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath18 is relatively big , @xmath196 , in the later part of the plasma era . here",
