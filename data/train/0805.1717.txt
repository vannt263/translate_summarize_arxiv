    "the aim of this paper to continue investigations on the moments of minkowski @xmath8 function , begun in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath8 (  the question mark function \" ) was introduced by minkowski as an example of a continuous function @xmath9 , which maps rationals to dyadic rationals , and quadratic irrationals to non - dyadic rationals . for non - negative real @xmath10",
    "it is defined by the expression @xmath11)=1 - 2^{-a_{0}}+2^{-(a_{0}+a_{1})}-2^{-(a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2})}+ ... , \\label{min}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 $ ] stands for the representation of @xmath10 by a ( regular ) continued fraction @xcite . by tradition , this function is more often investigated in the interval @xmath13 $ ] , and in this case it is normalized in order @xmath14 , whereas in our case @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , we make a convention that @xmath16 for @xmath17 $ ] . for rational @xmath10 , the series terminates at the last nonzero partial quotient @xmath18 of the continued fraction .",
    "this function is continuous , monotone and singular @xcite . by far not complete overview of the papers written about the minkowski question mark function or closely related topics ( farey tree , enumeration of rationals , stern s diatomic sequence , various 1-dimensional generalizations and generalizations to higher dimensions , statistics of denominators and farey intervals , hausdorff dimension and analytic properties )",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "these works include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( this is the only paper where the moments of a certain singular distribution - a close relative of @xmath0 - were considered ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the internet page @xcite contains up - to - date and exhaustive bibliography list of papers related to minkowski question mark function .",
    "+ recently , in calkin and wilf @xcite defined a binary tree which is generated by the iteration @xmath19 starting from the root @xmath20 .",
    "the last two authors have greatly publicized this tree , but it was known long ago to physicists and mathematicians ( alias , stern - brocot or farey tree ) .",
    "elementary considerations show that this tree contains every positive rational number once and only once , each being represented in lowest terms .",
    "the first four iterations lead to @xmath21 & & & & & & & & { 2\\over 1 } \\ar@{-}[ullll ] & & & \\\\ & { 1\\over 3 } \\ar@{-}[urr ] & & & & { 3\\over 2}\\ar@{-}[ull ] & & & & { 2\\over 3}\\ar@{-}[urr ] & & & & { 3\\over 1 } \\ar@{-}[ull ] & \\\\ { 1\\over 4 } \\ar@{-}[ur ] & & { 4\\over 3 } \\ar@{-}[ul ] & & { 3\\over 5 } \\ar@{-}[ur ] & & { 5\\over 2 } \\ar@{-}[ul ] & & { 2\\over 5 } \\ar@{-}[ur ] & & { 5\\over 3 } \\ar@{-}[ul ] & & { 3\\over 4 } \\ar@{-}[ur ] & & { 4\\over 1 } \\ar@{-}[ul ] } \\label{cw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is of utmost importance to note that the @xmath22th generation consists of exactly those @xmath23 positive rational numbers , whose elements of the continued fraction sum up to @xmath22 .",
    "this fact can be easily inherited directly from the definition .",
    "first , if rational number @xmath24 is represented as a continued fraction @xmath25 $ ] , then the map @xmath26 maps @xmath24 to @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "second , the map @xmath28 maps @xmath24 to @xmath29 $ ] in case @xmath30 , and to @xmath31 $ ] in case @xmath32 .",
    "this is an important fact which makes the investigations of rational numbers according to their position in the calkin - wilf tree highly motivated from the perspective of metric number theory and dynamics of continued fractions .",
    "+ it is well known that each generation of ( [ cw ] ) possesses a distribution function @xmath33 , and @xmath33 converges uniformly to @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath0 as a distribution function ( in the sense of probability theory , which imposes the condition of monotonicity ) is uniquely determined by the functional equation @xcite @xmath34 this implies @xmath35 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath0 has been investigated by several authors , and was proved to be @xmath36 .",
    "lastly , and most importantly , let us point out that , surprisingly , there are striking similarities and parallels between the results proved in @xcite and @xcite with lewis-zagier s ( @xcite , @xcite ) results on period functions for maass wave forms .",
    "( see @xcite for the explanation of this phenomena ) .",
    "+ just before formulating the main theorem of this paper , we provide a short summary of previous results proved by the author about certain natural integral transforms of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath37 both sequences are of definite number - theoretical significance because @xmath38^{l},\\quad m_{l}=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}2^{2-n}\\sum\\limits_{a_{1}+ ... +a_{s}=n}[0,a_{1}, .. ,a_{s}]^{l},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the summation takes place over rational numbers represented as continued fractions ; thus , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "we define the exponential generating functions @xmath41 one directly verifies that @xmath42 is an entire function , and that @xmath43 is meromorphic function with simple poles at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "further , we have @xmath46 the second identity represents only the symmetry property , given by @xmath35 .",
    "the main result about @xmath42 is that it is uniquely determined by the regularity condition @xmath47 , as @xmath48 , the boundary condition @xmath49 , and the integral equation @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 stands for the bessel function @xmath52 ) .",
    "+ our primary object of investigations is the generating function of moments .",
    "let @xmath53 .",
    "this series converges for @xmath54 , and the functional equation for @xmath1 ( see below ) implies that there exist all derivatives of @xmath1 at @xmath55 , if we approach this point while remaining in the domain @xmath56",
    ". then the integral @xmath57 ( which is stieltjes transform of @xmath0 ) extends @xmath1 to the cut plane @xmath58 .",
    "the generating function of moments @xmath59 does not exist due to the factorial growth of @xmath59 , but this generating function can still be defined in the cut plane @xmath60 by @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , this integral just equals to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , there exist all higher derivatives of @xmath1 at @xmath55 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the following result was proved in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath1 , defined initially as a power series , has an analytic continuation to the cut plane @xmath58 via ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "it satisfies the functional equation @xmath65 and also the symmetry property @xmath66 ( which is a consequence of the main functional equation ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath67 , if @xmath68 and the distance from @xmath69 to a half line @xmath70 tends to infinity .",
    "conversely , the function having these properties is unique .",
    "[ thm1.0 ]    accordingly , this result and the specific appearance of the three term functional equation justifies the name for @xmath1 as _ the dyadic period function_. + we wish to emphasize that the main motivation for previous research was clarification of the nature and structure of the moments @xmath71 .",
    "it was greatly desirable to give these constants ( emerging as if from geometric chaos ) some other expression than the one obtained directly from the farey ( or calkin - wilf ) tree , which could reveal their structure to greater extent .",
    "this is accomplished in the current work .",
    "thus , the main result can be formulated as follows .",
    "there exist canonical and explicit sequence of rational functions @xmath72 , such that for @xmath73 one has an absolutely convergent series @xmath74 where @xmath75 is polynomial with rational coefficients of degree @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath77 it has the following reciprocity property : @xmath78 [ thm1.1 ]              consider a contour , consisting of the segment @xmath89 $ ] , and a semicircle @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath92 , @xmath93 will be large on the semicircle .",
    "moreover , this function never vanishes inside or on the contour .",
    "thus , from the maximum - minimum principle , its minimal absolute value is obtained on the segment @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "thus , let @xmath94 , @xmath95 . without loss of generality , let @xmath96 .",
    "consider the case @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath98 the function @xmath99 is an increasing function in @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "it is obvious that we may consider a case of @xmath102 sufficiently large .",
    "thus , @xmath103 let now @xmath104 .",
    "first , consider a function @xmath105 .",
    "it is a decreasing function for @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , this is equivalent to the inequality @xmath107 the function on the left is itself a decreasing function , with maximum value attained at @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 , which means @xmath110 , and this gives @xmath111 therefore , lemma [ lema.2 ] implies that the function @xmath112 is uniformly bounded : @xmath113 this shows the validity of the following lemma ( apart from a numerical bound , which is the outcome of computer calculations ) .        unfortunately , corollary [ cor1.3 ] is not very useful in finding exact decimal digits of @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , the vector @xmath116 is the solution of an ( infinite ) system of linear equations , which encodes the functional equation ( [ funk ] ) ( see @xcite , proposition 6 ) .",
    "namely , if we denote @xmath117 , we have a linear system for @xmath118 which describes the coefficients @xmath118 uniquely : @xmath119 note that this system is not homogeneous ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "we truncate this matrix at sufficiently high order to obtain float values .",
    "the accuracy of this calculation can be checked on the test value @xmath121 .",
    "this approach yields ( for the matrix of order @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 with all @xmath124 digits exact ( note that @xmath125 ) .",
    "in fact , the truncation of this matrix at an order @xmath122 gives rather accurate values for @xmath71 for @xmath126 , well in correspondence with an asymptotic formula @xcite @xmath127{4\\pi^{2}\\log2}\\cdot c_{0}\\cdot l^{1/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}+o({\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}l^{-1/4 } ) , \\label{asympt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 .",
    "so obtained numerical values for higher moments tend to deviate from this expression rather quickly .",
    "+ kinney @xcite proved that the hausdorff dimension of growth points of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath129 lagarias @xcite gives the following estimates : @xmath130 .",
    "tichy and uitz @xcite calculated @xmath131 .",
    "paradis et al .",
    "@xcite give the value @xmath132 .",
    "we have ( note that @xmath133 ) : @xmath134 thus , we are able to present much more precise result : @xmath135 with all @xmath136 digits exact .",
    "the author of this paper have contacted the authors of @xcite inquiring about the error bound for the numerical value of @xmath137 they obtained .",
    "it appears that for this purpose 10 generations of ( [ cw ] ) were used .",
    "the authors of @xcite were very kind in agreeing to perform the same calculations with more generations .",
    "thus , if one uses @xmath138 generations , this gives @xmath139 .",
