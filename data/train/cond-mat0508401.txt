    "single - wall carbon nanotubes exhibit a variety of interesting transport phenomena at low temperatures @xcite . at weak coupling to the metal electrodes the whole length of the nanotube may serve as single quantum dot , demonstrating a coulomb blockade behavior at low temperatures @xcite . as the quality of the nanotube samples have improved over time , the single - electron conductance peaks in the coulomb blockade regime have been found to group in clusters of four @xcite . this behavior has been attributed to pairs of quantum - mechanical orbitals that originate in two subbands of the nanotube electronic dispersion and are close in energy , forming four - electron `` shells '' .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the shell structure in metallic carbon nanotubes .",
    "we find that in a large percentage of shells the two orbitals are degenerate with a possible level mismatch not exceeding one tenth of the shell spacing .",
    "the existence of degeneracy in real nanotube devices does not follow trivially from the symmetry properties of 2d graphite , as claimed in refs .",
    "indeed , a sizable orbital mismatch was found in most studies @xcite . in this paper , we report on experimental observation of the orbital degeneracy over a large number of states .",
    "our finding also demonstrates that the electrons are reflected without mode mixing at the metal contacts . by studying magnetic field dependence , we find that two electrons occupying a pair of degenerate orbitals form a triplet state starting from zero magnetic field",
    ". finally , we observe unexpected low - energy excitations when a four - electron shell is completely filled , both in the sequential tunneling regime and in the inelastic cotunneling .",
    "the nanotubes were grown by a cvd method using co as a feedstock gas ( the details are described in our earlier publication @xcite ) , and cr / au contacts were patterned by e - beam lithography .",
    "we present results measured on metallic nanotubes .",
    "we measure the differential conductance at temperatures of 0.3 or 1.2 k by a standard ac technique at the excitation level of 10 - 50 @xmath0v rms .",
    "=    figure 1a shows the coulomb blockaded conductance measured in a narrow range of gate voltages on a 750 nm long nanotube at @xmath1 k. most single - electron conductance peaks cluster in groups of four , where the peaks within each cluster have similar heights @xcite .",
    "the spacing between the peaks in each cluster is smaller than the spacing between the neighboring clusters .",
    "figure 1b demonstrates a similar peak clustering measured on a 600 nm long nanotube at @xmath2 k. this behavior is further illustrated in figure 2 , where we plot the _ addition energies _ required to add consecutive electrons to the nanotube of figure 1a .",
    "( the `` addition energy '' @xcite is measured as the gate voltage spacing between the neighboring conductance peaks multiplied by a factor @xmath3 which we later find to be @xmath4 from figure 4 . )",
    "the exceptional reproducibility of the pattern over a wide range of gate voltages and the relatively large nanotube length allows us to trace the positions of hundreds of conductance peaks within the same sample .",
    "we extract the peak positions from the successive gate voltage sweeps and keep only the peak positions which coincide in different sweeps . by doing this ,",
    "we get rid of the relatively rare random offset charge events , which rigidly shift the conductance curves in narrow ranges of gate voltage .",
    "one can see extended ranges of gate voltage where three successive addition energies are very close and each fourth addition energy is significantly ( @xmath5 ) larger than the base line ( one of such regions is illustrated in figure 2b ) .",
    "this pattern follows from the peak clustering observed in figure 1 , where the larger addition energies correspond to the spacing between the clusters .",
    "=    let us for now assume the `` constant interaction model '' @xcite and ignore the mismatch @xmath6 between the orbitals in a shell .",
    "then , a constant charging energy @xmath7 is required to add an electron to a partially filled shell .",
    "a larger energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the shell spacing , is required to add an electron to the next shell . as a result ,",
    "the addition energies within each shell are equal to @xmath7 , while the addition energy required to put an electron to a new shell is @xmath8 , in agreement with observations in figures 2a and b. experimentally , we obtain @xmath10 3.5 mev and @xmath11 2 mev .",
    "the latter agrees well with the expected @xmath12 ( = 2 mev for @xmath13 nm ) .",
    "such a simple description may be applicable because the exchange interaction @xmath14 and the excess interaction of two electrons occupying the same orbital @xmath15 are expected to be small compared to the shell spacing @xmath9 , as discussed in the next section ( see also appendix ) @xcite . both @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are further reduced by the relatively large diameter of our nanotubes ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the regular four - electron shell filling is disrupted at some gate voltages , where electrons occupy non - degenerate orbitals . in such cases",
    ", one observes pairs of conductance peaks , closely spaced and of similar heights @xcite .",
    "the addition energy of the second electron in a pair is smaller than the addition energy of the first electron ( `` even - odd oscillations '' ) , as visible in figure 2a _ e.g. _ around @xmath17 v.",
    "it is important , that while the orbital degeneracy is absent at some gate voltages , it is observed over other extended ranges of gate voltage .",
    "apparent clustering of four conductance peaks does not yet guarantee the orbital degeneracy .",
    "indeed , the clusters are visible even when the two orbitals are not degenerate , and the level mismatch @xmath6 could be as high as 0.2 to 0.4 of @xmath9 @xcite . also , a relatively large @xmath6 may be masked by the high contact transparency that introduces lifetime broadening of the peaks @xcite . in our measurements ,",
    "the peaks are narrow and the orbital degeneracy is revealed : we find , that for a large fraction of the shells @xmath6 is negligible .",
    "for example , in figure 2b ,",
    "the largest level mismatch @xmath6 is observed at @xmath18 v ( the second addition energy in a shell is slightly larger than its neighbors ) . here",
    "@xmath19 0.2 mev is equal to 0.1 @xmath9 .",
    "the low values of the orbital mismatch , observed over a large number of states , point to the existence of a mechanism establishing the orbital degeneracy , rather than an accidental alignment of levels .",
    "the orbital degeneracy survives significant variations in @xmath9 that are likely caused by the disorder potential ( notice variations of the inter - cluster spacings in figure 2b ) .",
    "it is known that long - range potential does not effectively introduce back scattering and mode mixing in metallic nanotubes @xcite . at the same time , the orbital degeneracy can be easily lifted by structural imperfections in the nanotube , such as pentagon - heptagon pairs @xcite , which introduce back scattering and mode mixing @xcite .",
    "apparently , these structural defects are relatively rare in our samples .",
    "experimental observation of the orbital degeneracy makes a non - trivial statement regarding the properties of the contacts : evidently , reflections at the contacts do not mix the subbands .",
    "let us consider these reflections in more details .",
    "we surmise that one of the degenerate orbitals originates in the vicinity of point @xmath20 in the nanotube dispersion ( inset of figure 1 ) and another orbital originates in the vicinity of point @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this means than an electron in state @xmath22 and moving to the right is reflected from the contact to the state at @xmath23 ( solid circles in the inset of figure 1 ) , and not to the state @xmath24 .",
    "similarly for the other orbital , electron in @xmath25 is reflected solely to @xmath24 ( open circles in the inset of figure 1 ) .",
    "such processes require an electron to change the dispersion branch upon reflection ( solid and dashed lines in the inset of figure 1 ) .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the metal contact perturbs the energy spectrum of the nanotube , mixing the two branches and opening a gap around @xmath26 . the resulting spectrum _ at the contacts",
    "_ then look like that of a semiconductor , and the electron could adiabatically move from @xmath27 to @xmath28 upon reflection .",
    "an alternative picture ( see _ e.g. _ a sketch in figure 1a of @xcite ) , where the states at @xmath22 and @xmath23 belong to different orbitals , seems unlikely in our case because ( i ) reflection from @xmath22 to @xmath29 requires a large momentum transfer @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ a sharp nanotube - metal interface .",
    "if so , the scattering to @xmath23 would be significant , and the two orbitals would mix and split in energy , contrary to our observations .",
    "( ii ) any possible degeneracy between the orbitals made of the states [ @xmath22 , @xmath24 ] and [ @xmath23 , @xmath25 ] would be only accidental .",
    "indeed , in this case the `` particle in a box '' quantization conditions yield for the two types of orbitals the energies of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are integers .",
    "the two sets of states coincide in energy only if @xmath36 equals an integer , a condition that can not be satisfied for a majority of states in a real sample .",
    "finally , we analyze the _ statistics _ of the addition energies ( for reviews on this subject see @xcite ) .",
    "we divide the addition energies into three categories : the addition energy corresponding to a complete shell filling ( @xmath37 blue squares in figure 2b ) , the addition energy corresponding to a half - filled shell ( @xmath38 , green circles ) , and the addition energies of the first and the third electrons in a shell ( @xmath39 , red diamonds ) .",
    "the statistical distribution of these energies is plotted by the corresponding colors in figure 2c . as expected ,",
    "the overall distribution is clearly bimodal , where the main lobe corresponds to the baseline of figure 2a , _",
    "i.e. _ to the charging energy",
    ". the high energy shoulder of the distribution is comprised of @xmath40 and @xmath8 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 has a significant weight at @xmath41 and for more than @xmath42 of states @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that in a significant fraction of the shells the level repulsion is suppressed , and the level degeneracy is _ not accidental_. finally , it appears that the distribution of @xmath9 is broader than the distribution for @xmath7 ( as seen in figures 2b and c ) .",
    "=    figure 3a shows the nanotube conductance as a function of the gate voltage and magnetic field perpendicular to the nanotube axis , @xmath44 , measured on a 600 nm long nanotube . at zero field",
    ", we see that the peaks form two clusters ( i and ii ) of four electrons , similar to figure 1 . the perpendicular field couples primarily to the spin of the electrons in the nanotube and not to their orbital motion , which allows us to study the spin state of the system . in cluster",
    "i , we observe that the two bottom traces move down in magnetic field , and the two top traces move up .",
    "this behavior indicates that pairs of consecutive electrons are added to the nanotube with the same spin projection ( i.e. spin up or spin down ) .",
    "therefore , two electrons occupying a shell form a triplet state @xcite , so that the sequence of the total spin of the nanotube as the electrons fill the shell is @xmath45 .",
    "such a behavior is in contrast with alternating @xmath46 and @xmath47 states found at zero field in shells with non - degenerate levels @xcite .    in cluster ii , the second and the third single - electron traces exhibit kinks around @xmath48 tesla ,",
    "a behavior observed in @xcite .",
    "namely , at low @xmath44 , the second trace from the bottom shifts up and the third trace shifts down with the field , indicating that the four electrons in shell ii enter the nanotube with alternating spin projections . in higher fields , these directions change : the second peak shifts down and the third peak shifts up , just as the traces in cluster i. evidently , in shell ii a small level mismatch exists at zero field . as a result , at fields below 4 tesla ,",
    "the two electrons form a singlet state on the lower orbital , while at fields above it , the zeeman energy forces the two electrons into a triplet state . from the value of the field at the kink location",
    ", we find the level mismatch in shell ii of @xmath49 mev ( relatively small , compared to the shell spacing @xmath50 mev in this sample ) . any possible level mismatch in shell",
    "i is at least several times smaller .    to further quantify the observed behavior , in figure 3b we present the addition energies measured as a function of @xmath44 on a different 600 nm nanotube in a shell similar to shell i in figure 3a .",
    "the cluster of four peaks where the data were measured is shown in the inset .",
    "the four different symbols mark the valleys from which the four addition energies ( @xmath51 ) were extracted for the main panel of figure 3b .",
    "we see that @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( triangles ) stay remarkably constant in magnetic field . at the same time , @xmath54 ( circles ) grows steadily with magnetic field with a slope close to @xmath55 ( dashed line ; @xmath56-factor in nanotubes is expected to be close to 2 ) .",
    "these observations prove that the first and the second electron are added with the same spin projection ( spin - up ) , while the third and the fourth electron are both added spin - down . in particular , this supports our statement that the two - electron ground state is a triplet down to the lowest magnetic fields . finally , @xmath57 ( squares ) is significantly larger ( by approximately @xmath9 ) than @xmath58 and steadily decreases at a slope close to @xmath55 , as expected .    for degenerate levels ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "the exchange interaction @xmath14 and excess interaction @xmath15 should show up in @xmath54 being greater than @xmath59 at zero magnetic field ( see appendix ) . from figure 3b",
    "we have to conclude that the possible @xmath14 and @xmath15 are very small , not exceeding @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "it is also noticeable from figure 3b that @xmath61 .",
    "( depending on the particular shell , we find that this inequality may be reversed , or the two energies may be equal . ) this behavior indicates that two electrons occupying the first ( slightly lower in energy ) orbital in a shell have a stronger repulsion than the two electrons occupying the second orbital ( see appendix ) .",
    "let us turn to the nanotube conductance at relatively large source - drain voltages @xmath62 .",
    "figure 4a shows the conductance map as a function of the gate voltage @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "the dark regions of suppressed conductance along the horizontal axis ( `` coulomb diamonds '' ) indicate that electron transport is blocked and the number of electrons in the nanotube is fixed .",
    "the sizes of the coulomb diamonds follow the same regular pattern as in figure 1 : three relatively small diamonds of a similar size follow a larger diamond .",
    "=    figure 4b shows the zoomed - in view of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 electron diamonds in figure 4a .",
    "the lines bordering the diamonds correspond to the resonances between the energy level in the nanotube and the fermi energy of either lead .",
    "we use them to extract the coefficient @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the inclined lines running parallel to the diamond boundaries correspond to the resonances between the fermi energy at the contacts and _ excited _ states of the nanotube in the sequential tunneling regime .",
    "the horizontal lines visible inside the coulomb diamonds ( marked by white dashes in figure 4b ) correspond to the inelastic cotunneling events , where an excitation is created as a result of an electron tunneling through the nanotube @xcite .",
    "the states marked by the inclined solid and dashed lines in figure 4b correspond to the ground and the excited states of the nanotube with @xmath65 electrons ( the topmost occupied four - electron shell is completely full ) .",
    "we find that these states are separated by an energy @xmath67 of only @xmath68 mev , several times smaller than the shell splitting @xmath9 extracted the ground state energies in figure 2 ( the scale of @xmath9 can also be gauged from the size difference between the @xmath65 and @xmath64 diamonds in figure 4 ) .",
    "this observation is especially surprising , given that the ground state with a completely filled topmost four - electron shell should be separated by @xmath69 from the lowest excited state .",
    "( this is true up to corrections due to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath6 , which in our case are negligible compared to @xmath9 , see discussion in the preceding sections . )",
    "the energy of the smallest excitation measured through the inelastic cotunneling threshold inside a @xmath65-electron diamond ( not shown ) coincides with @xmath67 extracted in the sequential tunneling regime .",
    "we consider several possible mechanisms to account for @xmath67 : quantized 1d vibrational modes of the nanotube , features in the density of states of the leads , or collective electronic excitations : ( _ i _ ) @xmath67 probably does not originate in the quantized phonon modes of the nanotube , as it would require a relatively long segment of the nanotube ( tens of nanometers ) to be decoupled from the substrate .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the same @xmath67 is visible in sequential tunneling in resonance with both the source and drain electrodes .",
    "it seems unlikely that both leads would possess a similar feature in the density of states .",
    "( _ iii _ ) alternatively , @xmath67 may represent an energy of a collective electronic excitation . it was recently suggested that in 1d gaas channels at low densities the interactions may renormalize the energies of the spin excitations to lower values @xcite . in our experiment ,",
    "the density of carriers near the contacts may possibly be reduced by opening of the local semiconducting gap as described above in section ii . in this case , the low - density 1d gas near the contacts is strongly correlated and may sustain the low energy excitations @xmath67 similar to the prediction of ref . @xcite . at the same time , the single - particle energy @xmath9 would be determined by the properties of the nanotube `` bulk '' , where interactions are relatively less important .",
    "further work is required to identify the origin of the low - energy excitations @xmath67 .",
    "we investigate the degeneracy of orbitals in metallic carbon nanotubes .",
    "we argue that the degeneracy does not follow directly from the presence of two subbands in the electronic dispersion of a nanotube .",
    "indeed , a sizable orbital mismatch was found within a shell in prior studies @xcite .",
    "we present an explanation of the degeneracy and discuss the necessary conditions for its observation .",
    "two electrons filling a pair of degenerate levels are found to form a triplet state down to lowest magnetic fields .",
    "finally , when a four - electron shell is completely filled , the large and clearly identifiable single - particle gap allows us to observe unexpected low - energy excitations , which may serve as an indication of collective electronic modes .",
    "we thank i. aleiner , h. baranger , r. berkovits , a. chang , b. halperin , k. matveev , y. oreg and d. ullmo for valuable discussions and m. prior and a. zhukov for technical assistance .",
    "the work is supported by nsf dmr-0239748 .",
    "in our analysis we use an effective hamiltonian in the spirit of ref .",
    "the expression invariant under rotations of the total spin is derived starting from the hartree - fock hamiltonian and using operator identities of ref .",
    "the resultant expression depends on @xmath70 ( 0 , 1 or 2 ) , the occupation number of orbital @xmath71 , and on @xmath72 ( 0 , @xmath73 or 0 , respectively ) , the total spin of the electrons occupying this orbital :    @xmath74)=   \\sum_i \\epsilon_i n_i + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i \\not= j } u_{ij } n_i n_j \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hphantom{[e } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i } u_{ii } n_i ( n_i-1)- \\sum_{i \\not= j } j_{ij } ( \\hat{\\bf s}_i \\cdot \\hat{\\bf s}_j + \\frac{1}{4 }   n_i n_j ) \\label{eq : e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath75 is the bare energy of an electron occupying orbital @xmath71 ; @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the direct and exchange interactions between two electrons on orbitals @xmath71 and @xmath78 .",
    "for the practically relevant case of two topmost ( partially ) occupied orbitals @xmath66 and @xmath79 the expression reduces to      where @xmath81 is the total spin of the electron system , here we disregarded interactions with the lower , completely filled orbitals .",
    "the energies of the relevant states with different electronic occupations ( presuming that orbital @xmath66 is slightly lower than @xmath79 ) are :                                                            r. saito , g. dresselhaus , and m. s. dresselhaus , physical properties of carbon nanotubes , world scientific , 1998 .",
    "points @xmath26 originate from the equivalent points @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the brillouin zone of the graphite monolayer that makes the nanotube .",
