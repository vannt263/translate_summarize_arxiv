    "in many applied problems we are interested in comparing two @xmath5-valued functions defined on a topological space , up to a certain group of tranformations . as an example , we can think of the case of taking pictures of two objects @xmath6 and @xmath7 from every possible oriented direction ( at a constant distance ) and comparing the sets of images we get .",

    "the two different sets of pictures can be considered similar if @xmath19 is small , where @xmath20 denotes the group of orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath16 and @xmath21 is the max - norm .",
    "the previous example illustrates the use of the following definition , where @xmath22 represents the set of all continuous functions from @xmath1 to @xmath5 .",
    "these functions are called _ @xmath23-dimensional filtering functions _ on the topological space @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we will assume that the space @xmath1 is triangulable .",
    "this assumption allows to guarantee that the persistent betti number functions ( pbnfs ) are finite without using any tameness assumption ( cf .",

    "the assumption that the pbnfs are finite is necessary to our treatment .",
    "we could weaken the assumption that @xmath1 is triangulable and consider a compact and locally contractible subspace of @xmath24 ( cf .",

    "if such a triangulation is available , we can replace the previously considered singular chains that are left fixed under the action of @xmath297 with simplicial chains that are left fixed under the action of @xmath297 . in other words , we can compute the simplicial homology of the quotient space @xmath396 via the quotient triangulation induced by the triangulation of @xmath1 . in several application",

    "we highlight that these triangulations _ do not _ depend on the filtering functions and have to be computed just once .",
    "actually , in several applications where each filtering function is the result of a measurement , just one topological space @xmath1 is involved , and hence only one invariant triangulation is required to apply our method .",
