    "more precisely , @xmath2 contribution to the neutrino mass matrix is proportional to @xmath69 , which rapidly approaches zero as @xmath4 , as indicated by eq .",

    "( [ 3loops ] ) they tend to cancel each other in the decoupling limit .",
    "therefore , the fact that supersymmetry forces @xmath70 when @xmath4 , produces a fine cancellation that eventually generates a small solar mass .",
    "this fine cancellation is not a fine - tuning because it is a cancellation forced by symmetry .",
    "in addition , the cp - odd higgs mass is dependent on the atmospheric mass through the ratio @xmath71 between solar at atmospheric scales .",
    "thus , the atmospheric mass also affects @xmath72 inversely although in an indirect way .",
    "our model explains the smallness of @xmath71 because the atmospheric mass is generated at tree - level while the solar mass is generated at one - loop .",
    "the cp - odd squared mass is proportional to @xmath73 , with an extra term @xmath74 in the denominator .",
    "this cross product is there because if @xmath75 and @xmath76 are parallel , the symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix observed at tree - level in eq .",
    "( [ detneut2 ] ) is not removed , and no solar mass is generated .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 is proportional to the @xmath37 boson mass , indicating that a majorana neutrino mass needs not only r - parity violation but a broken @xmath77 symmetry as well .",
    "additionally , @xmath72 is proportional to @xmath78 because the relevant vacuum expectation value is @xmath79 .",
    "we also notice that the cp - odd higgs mass squared is proportional to the effective zino mass and to the photino mass , normalized by both relevant gaugino masses .",
    "the appearance of the photino mass is due to the tree - level contribution to the effective neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the origin of the zino mass is that it is the zino component of each neutralino the one that contributes to the neutrino mass matrix , and it multiplies the neutralino masses from the fermionic propagator .",
