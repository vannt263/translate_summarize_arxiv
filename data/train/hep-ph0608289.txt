    "the standard model(@xmath8 ) provides an excellent effective field theory description of almost all particle physics experiments .",
    "but in the @xmath8 the higgs boson mass suffers from an instability under radiative corrections .",
    "the naturalness argument suggests that the cutoff scale of the sm is not much above the electroweak scale : new physics will appear around tev energies .",
    "the possible new physics scenarios at the tev scale might be supersymmetry@xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite , extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently , a new model , known as little higgs model has drawn a lot of interest and it offers a very promising solution to the hierarchy problem in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of nonlinearly realized symmetry @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate global symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a vev at a scale of a few tev and thus is naturally light .",
    "the most economical little higgs model is the so - called littlest higgs model , which is based on a @xmath9 nonlinear sigma model @xcite .",
    "it consists of a @xmath10 global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken down to @xmath11 by a vacuum condensate @xmath12 . in this model ,",
    "a set of new heavy gauge bosons@xmath13 and a new heavy - vector - like quark(t ) are introduced which just cancel the quadratic divergence induced by the @xmath8 gauge boson loops and the top quark loop , respectively .",
    "the distinguishing features of this model are the existence of these new particles and their couplings to the light higgs .",
    "the measurement of these new particle effects might prove the existence of the littlest higgs mechanism .",
    "+ the hunt for the higgs boson and the elucidation of the mechanism of symmetry breaking is one of the most important goals for present and future high energy collider experiments .",
    "precision electroweak measurement data and direct searches suggest that the higgs boson must be relative light and its mass should be roughly in the range of 114.4 gev@xmath14208 gev at @xmath15 cl @xcite .",
    "the high energy linear @xmath4 colliders(@xmath5 ) has a large potential for the discovery of new particles@xcite . due to its rather clean environment",
    ", the @xmath5 will be perfectly suited for precise analysis of physics beyond the @xmath8 as well as for testing the @xmath8 with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "an unique feature of the @xmath5 is that it can be transformed to @xmath16 or @xmath17 colliders with the photon beams generated by laser - scattering method .",
    "their effective luminosity and energy are expected to be comparable to those of the @xmath5 . in some scenarios , they are the best instrument for the discovery of signatures of new physics .",
    "+ some phenomenological studies of the littlest higgs model via @xmath17 or @xmath16 collision has been done @xcite .",
    "the main w boson production mechanism is provided by the process @xmath18+e@xmath19w+@xmath20 . the larger cross section for w",
    "boson production suggests that the process @xmath0 can be exploited as a source for higgs boson emitted from the w - boson line . in the context of the sm",
    ", this process has been studied at leading order @xcite .",
    "since the final state consists of three particles two of which are heavy , the cross section at moderate energies(@xmath21 ) is smaller than that of the standard @xmath22 fusion mechanism @xmath23 , the higgs - strahlung process @xmath24 and the @xmath25 fusion mechanism @xmath26 .",
    "these three processes have been studied in the context of the sm@xcite and the littlest higgs model@xcite . however , at higher energies the cross section for the process @xmath0 is nearly as large as that of the dominant @xmath27 and the process for most of the mass of higss boson range accessible at linear colliders , and significantly larger than the cross section of the higgs - strahlung process . a dedicated @xmath3 collider with back scattered laser beam",
    "therefore gives rise to a large higgs production cross section through the process @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is very interesting to study this process in the popular specific models beyond the sm .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the corrections of new particles predicted by the littlest higgs model to the process @xmath2 and see whether the effects on this process can be observed in the future @xmath5 experiments with the c.m energy @xmath6=500 gev .",

    "the littlest model is briefly introduced , and then the production amplitude of the process is given .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in section three .",

    "the littlest higgs model is based on the @xmath9 nonlinear sigma model . at the scale @xmath28@xmath12",
    ", the global @xmath10 symmetry is broken into its subgroup @xmath11 via a vacuum condensate @xmath12 , resulting in 14 goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective field theory of these goldstone bosons is parameterized by a non - linear @xmath29 model with gauged symmetry @xmath30^{2}$ ] , spontaneously broken down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath31 , identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "four of these goldstone bosons are eaten by the broken gauge generators , leaving 10 states that transform under the sm gauge group as a doublet h and a triplet @xmath32 .",
    "this breaking scenario also gives rise to four massive gauge bosons @xmath33,@xmath34 and @xmath35 , which might produce the characteristic signatures in the present and future high energy collider experiments @xcite .",
