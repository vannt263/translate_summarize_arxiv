    "the interaction between water and graphite has been the concern of theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "a deep understanding of the features and properties of this interaction is of great interest in technological applications @xcite , environmental sciences @xcite , and astrophysics @xcite , among other fields . the establishment of either the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of graphite at nanoscopic scales , which is of particular relevance in those applications , must be based on the knowledge of this interaction .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "( hereafter referred to as i ) , we have developed a model for the water - graphite interaction and found the likely candidates for the global potential energy minima of ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 clusters with @xmath4 on the ( 0001)-surface of graphite .",
    "out of this model , we have obtained a rather hydrophobic water - graphite interaction at the nanoscopic scale . as a consequence of this property ,",
    "the water component of the lowest graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 minima is quite closely related to low - lying minima of the corresponding ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 clusters . in about half of the cases the geometrical substructure of the water molecules in the graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 global minimum coincides with that of the corresponding free water cluster .",
    "exceptions occur when the interaction with graphite induces a change in the geometry of the water moiety .",
    "our general conclusions were in agreement with the sparse experimental @xcite and theoretical data @xcite . besides , the structures of these minima for @xmath9 coincided with those provided by empirical @xcite and ab initio calculations @xcite .    in our study ,",
    "the water - water interaction was described by the tip4p intermolecular potential model @xcite .",
    "the related tip3p potential @xcite was also used to model this interaction for @xmath10 .",
    "the global minimum structures found for these clusters coincided with those of the tip4p model .",
    "however , the observed dependence of the structure of the water - graphite global minima on the structure of the corresponding free water clusters and the known dependence of the latter on the water - water interaction model for @xmath7 anticipated a dependence of the structure of these larger water - graphite clusters on the form chosen to model the water - water interaction . in i , preliminary results with the tip3p model confirmed this prediction . in this article , we will present the concluding results from our analysis of this dependence by considering also the tip5p model @xcite .",
    "as in i , we will make use of the water - graphite interaction model developed there and the basin - hopping method to find the likely candidates for the global potential energy minima of graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 clusters with @xmath4 and the tip3p and tip5p water - water interaction models , and perform a systematic comparison of the cluster structures found with these and the tip4p model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize the relevant details of the model developed in i for the water - graphite interaction . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present likely candidates for the cluster global potential energy minima together with their association and binding energies for both the tip3p and tip5p water - water interaction models .",
    "we shall also compare these global minimum structures with those found in i for the tip4p model .",
    "finally , section [ sec4 ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the closed - shell electronic structure of both graphite and water makes an empirical approach to the potential energy surface ( pes ) for the water - graphite and water - water interactions particularly attractive . in i",
    ", we wrote the potential energy of a graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 cluster as a sum of two contributions @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sum of pairwise water - water interactions , and @xmath13 is the water - graphite term .",
    "for the water - water interaction , the tip4p model was the primary choice in i ; here we will study the performance of the tip3p and tip5p potentials .",
    "all these models describe each water molecule as the same rigid body with two positive charges on the hydrogen atoms and either a balancing negative charge at the oxygen atom ( tip3p ) or close to the oxygen atom ( tip4p ) , or two balancing negative charges close to the oxygen atom and out of the molecular plane ( tip5p ) , together with a dispersion - repulsion center on the oxygen atom .",
    "hence , @xmath12 is a sum of pairwise additive coulomb and lennard - jones terms .",
    "we should remind here that the tip@xmath0p are a family of empirical water - water potentials whose parameters have been appropriately set so as to reproduce some properties of the liquid water phase at room temperature .",
    "potentials from these family have been used in the study of homogeneous water clusters @xcite , water clusters containing metallic cations @xcite , and water - c@xmath14 clusters @xcite .",
    "the water - graphite interaction is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a sum of pairwise dispersion - repulsion terms between the oxygen and the carbon atoms .",
    "each of these terms is expressed as a lennard - jones potential , whose parameters were obtained using the standard lorentz - berthelot combination rules from the corresponding parameters for the oxygen - oxygen and carbon - carbon interactions in tip@xmath0p water and steele @xcite graphene - graphene potentials , respectively .",
    "specifically , we used the values @xmath17 kj / mol and @xmath18 for the tip3p , and @xmath19 kj / mol and @xmath20 for the tip5p ( see @xcite for tip4p parameters ) , which are similar to those derived by werder _",
    "@xcite to fit the contact angle for a water droplet on a graphene surface .",
    "a simple analytic form for @xmath16 can be obtained using steele summation method @xcite over the graphite periodic structure by writing the interaction of a dispersion center with a graphite layer as a fourier series .",
    "the total repulsion - dispersion interaction is obtained as a sum of such terms over each graphite layer .",
    "we have obtained well converged values by including the continuum contribution from the two upper layers and the first corrugation from the first layer .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath21 includes the energy associated with the polarization of graphite due to the electric field of all the water point charges .",
    "this many - body interaction , which turns out to be smaller than @xmath16 , was evaluated using a continuous representation of graphite in terms of two contributions,@xmath22 each one associated , respectively , with the response of graphite to the electric field component parallel and perpendicular to the graphite surface .",
    "for the first one , @xmath23 , we assumed that graphite behaves as a classical conductor , which allowed us to make use of the image charge method to obtain its analytical form .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath24 , we associated to the graphite surface a constant surface polarizability density @xmath25 such that when an electric field depending on the surface point and perpendicular to the layer , @xmath26 , is applied , an electric dipole density , @xmath27 , is induced on that layer , with @xmath28 . using image charge methods",
    "one readily shows that if the graphite surface coincides with the plane @xmath29 , the induced image of an electric charge @xmath30 at the point @xmath31 is an electric dipole @xmath32 at the point @xmath33 and direction parallel to the @xmath34 axis .",
    "this result can be generalized additively to the case of several electric point charges to obtain an analytical form for @xmath24 .",
    "the value of the polarizability density @xmath25 was estimated from @xmath35 , the relative electric permittivity of graphite for applied electric fields perpendicular to the ( 0001 ) surface , whose value is @xmath36 ; namely , @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the graphite interlayer distance .",
    "we obtained by this procedure @xmath40 @xmath39 .",
    "all other electrostatic contributions to the water - graphite interaction energy having vanishing continuous terms ( as the water - charge carbon - quadrupole interaction ) have been neglected , as well as the mclachlan substrate mediated water - water interaction @xcite .",
    "this potential energy surface was argued to be superior to previous empirical models @xcite .",
    "likely candidates for the global potential energy minima of graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 clusters with @xmath4 were located using the basin - hopping scheme @xcite , which corresponds to the  monte carlo plus energy minimization approach of li and scheraga @xcite .",
    "this method has been used successfully for both neutral @xcite and charged atomic and molecular clusters @xcite , along with many other applications @xcite ; of course , this was the method used in i. in the size range considered here the global optimization problem is relatively straightforward .",
    "the global minimum is generally found in fewer than @xmath41 basin - hopping steps , independently of the random starting geometry . in some cases , starting out from the ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 global potential minimum , the corresponding global minimum for graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 is found even faster . however , the success hit rate of the optimization method decreases significantly and the likelihood of our candidates decreases .",
    "as a matter of fact , we have been able to find for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in each case , a tip4p global minimum candidate with energy lower than the one found in i ; although these new candidates present structures very similar to the previously reported ones .    for graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 clusters , association energies , @xmath44 , are defined for the process @xmath45 we also define the water binding energy , @xmath46 , as the difference between the association energies of graphite-(h@xmath2o)@xmath3 and ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 ; that is , @xmath47 the clusters in these expressions are assumed to be in their global minimum . the structures and association energies employed here for the global minima of ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 coincide precisely with those obtained by wales and hodges @xcite , kabrede and hentschke @xcite , and james et al .",

    "the number of these equivalences is similar to the number of equivalences between the three model potentials in the corresponding free water clusters , although these equivalences involve different clusters and potentials .",
    "for instance ,",
    "tip3p and tip5p provide equivalent free water global minima for @xmath66 ; both models present the @xmath79 `` cube '' conformation , while tip4p global minimum has an @xmath80 `` cube '' conformation . on the other hand , the corresponding water clusters on graphite",

    "are found for the three model potentials .",
    "when we compare the conformation of the water substructure on the graphite surface with that of the corresponding free water cluster , we find also a markedly different behavior for the tip3p model .",
    "with the exception of the first six clusters and the case @xmath72 , those two conformations are inequivalent .",
    "in other word , the water - graphite interaction is able to strongly modify the structure of the free water clusters .",
    "this together with the monolayer conformation of the adsorbed water clusters would point out to a hydrophilic water - graphite interaction for this potential model .",
    "however this behavior seem to be due to finite size effects since we have not found monolayer global minimum structures for @xmath86 , neither local minima monolayer conformations that are close in energy to the global minima . for @xmath7 in tip4p and @xmath87 in tip5p , we do not find either such monolayer structures for these two potential models .",
    "thus the hydrophobic nature of the water - graphite interaction appears earlier in these models .",
    "furthermore , in some cases for the two latter models , the conformation of the water substructure on graphite and that of the corresponding free water cluster are equivalent .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath88 for tip4p and @xmath65 , @xmath89 for tip5p . in these cases ,",
    "the water substructure is equivalent to a low - lying local minimum of the corresponding tip@xmath0p ( h@xmath2o)@xmath3 cluster , rather than to the global minimum .",
    "the energy penalty for this choice is mainly compensated by a more favorable dispersion - repulsion contribution to the interaction energy with graphite , which arises from a larger water - graphite contact area .",
    "in the structures for the three model potentials one finds square and pentagonal water rings ; on the other hand , hexagonal rings are less common but they appear more often in tip5p ( @xmath90 ) than in tip3p and tip4p ( just for @xmath43 ) .    for tip4p ,",
    "the complete two - layer water structures for even @xmath8 are precisely the structures of the global tip4p free water clusters .",
    "therefore , these structures interact with graphite in an optimal way and they keep their structure in the corresponding water - graphite clusters . on the other hand , for odd @xmath8 , the free water global minima do not show optimal surfaces for its interaction with graphite , thus explaining why these clusters change their structure to minimize that interaction energy .",
