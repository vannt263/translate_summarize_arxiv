    "the three - level @xmath0-type system is known as a very important model in quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "many quantum information tasks , such as the preparations of entanglement and the operations of various quantum gates , can be implemented in physical systems which are equivalent or approximately equivalent to three - level systems with @xmath0-type structures @xcite .",
    "it is universally known that , to manipulate states of a three - level quantum system with electromagnetic field , there exists two typical methods , the @xmath1-pulse @xcite and the adiabatic passage @xcite .",
    "these two methods hold their own advantages , but both reveal their shortcomings .",
    "the @xmath1-pulse allows physical systems evolve quickly , but the pulses should be controlled very accurately , which bring challenges to experiments in some cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the adiabatic passage is famous for its robustness against the imperfect operations and the deviations of the control parameters , but badly limits the evolution speed of the systems , which makes the systems more sensitive to some kinds of noise and decoherence factors . for the sake of both high evolution speed and robustness , a new technique named `` shortcuts to adiabatic passage '' ( stap )",
    "@xcite has been proposed .",
    "the stap suggests the system evolving in a controllable nonadiabatic way , so that the adiabatic condition , which limits the evolution speed of the system , can be abandoned . besides , when the boundary condition of the control parameters is well designed , the stap is also robust against the imperfect operations and the deviations of the control parameters .",
    "since the stap combines the advantages of both the @xmath1-pulse and the adiabatic passage , it has attracted many interests of researches in different fields @xcite . for example , torrontegui _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used stap to transport bose - einstein condensates .",
    "@xcite have achieved a population inversion in a two - level quantum system with stap . among these schemes @xcite , the method named `` transitionless quantum driving '' ( tqd ) ( also known as the `` counterdiabatic driving '' ) @xcite is one of the famous methods for constructing stap , whose idea is to cancel the nonadiabatic transitions between the eigenstates for the original hamiltonian of the system by adding `` counterdiabatic '' ( cd ) terms .",
    "the cd terms can be calculated easily , and their mathematic expressions are usually not too complex .",
    "for example , demirplak _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have first used counterdiabatic fields to accelerate adiabatic passages , and shown that a population transfer between molecular states could be perfectly achieved , which is a pioneering work of stap .",
    "moreover , du _",
    "_ @xcite have experimentally shown that tqd could be used to design pulses to construct stap for cold atoms .",
    "furthermore , tqd has also be exploited by an _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to experimentally realize trapped - ion displacement in phase space .",
    "however , the cd terms sometimes play the roles as the additional couplings which are hard to be realized in real experiments . for example , it is indicated in many previous schemes @xcite that , for a three - level @xmath0-type atom , the cd terms are the special one - photon 1 - 3 pulse ( the microwave field ) , which bring troubles to the experimental realization .    to overcome the difficulties of tqd , many interesting schemes @xcite",
    "have been put forward .",
    "for example , ibez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have pointed out that a sequence of shortcuts to adiabaticity can be built with similar way of tqd via iterative interaction pictures .",
    "subsequently , this method was used in a three - level system with @xmath0-type structure by song _",
    "they have shown that the difficulties of tqd can be overcome , and the stap can be constructed by adjusting the rabi frequencies of pulses in original hamiltonian , so the additional couplings are unnecessary .",
    "_ @xcite have also come up with an interesting idea to construct an experimentally feasible hamiltonian for a three - level system by using multi - mode driving of a set of moving states .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed an interesting scheme to speed up the quantum transfer for a three - level system with a serial of dressed states .",
    "they have shown that canceling the transitions between the chosen dressed states instead of the transitions between the eigenstates of the original hamiltonian can avoid the difficulties of tqd , and the extra couplings are also unnecessary .    inspired by the works @xcite",
    ", we propose an alternative scheme to accelerate the quantum transfer for the system with three - level @xmath0-type structure .",
    "different from previous schemes , we directly investigate the dynamics of the three - level @xmath0-type system and the solution of the schrdinger equation with only one picture transformation .",
    "the relationships of several parameters are studied . by designing these parameters suitably",
    ", the rabi frequencies of pulses can be directly given , and they can be expressed by the linear superpositions of gaussian functions , which are feasible in experiments . meanwhile ,",
    "the additional couplings are not required . in the end of the paper",
    ", we perform the numerical simulations , which show that the present scheme is effective .",
    "what is more , the quantum transfer can be significantly accelerated by applying the scheme instead of that with the stimulated raman adiabatic passage .",
    "in this section , we start to introduce the method of the present scheme . for a system with the three - level @xmath0-type structure , the hamiltonian has the general form as @xmath2 where pulse with rabi frequency @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) drives the transition @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "it is obviously that when @xmath53 , which gives @xmath56 or @xmath57 , the result is @xmath58 .",
    "that means the quantum transfer can not be realized when @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we select @xmath59 here .",
    "so we have latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath111 denotes the pulse amplitude for stirap , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are two related parameters . setting @xmath114 and @xmath115 , rabi frequencies @xmath108 and",

    "we plot @xmath116 versus @xmath111 for the stirap method in fig .",
    "3 . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , with stirap , for obtaining an enough high population of state @xmath117 , one should have @xmath118 . when @xmath119 , @xmath116 is 0.0002 . for the present scheme",
    ", we have @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "but for stirap , when @xmath122 , @xmath123 due to the great violation of the adiabatic condition . as we mentioned above in this section , for a relatively high evolution speed , the product of the pulse amplitude and the total interaction time is the smaller the better .",
    "therefore , using the present scheme , the quantum transfer can be significantly accelerated .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us check the robustness of the scheme with some numerical simulations .",
    "firstly , we would like to show the robustness of the scheme against the parameters errors caused by the imperfect operations . here , we consider the errors @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 of the total interaction time @xmath104 , the rabi frequencies of pulses @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . before we perform the numerical simulations , we assume that @xmath129 is the erroneous total interaction time . @xmath130 versus @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    "are shown by the blue crosses and the solid - red line in fig .",
    "4 , respectively . and",
    "@xmath130 versus @xmath133 is plotted by the dashed - green line in fig .",
    "4 .    seen from the dashed - green line in fig .",
    "4 , we find that the scheme is quite robust against the timing errors , i.e. , when @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 .",
    "besides , according to the blue crosses and the solid - red line in fig .",
    "4 , the influences of pulses errors are larger than the timing error , however , @xmath136 keeps higher than 0.9745 when @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the scheme holds nice robustness against the parameters errors .",
    "secondly , let us analyze the robustness of the scheme against the decoherent factors . here",
    ", we consider a superconducting ( sc ) qubit with @xmath0-type structure .",
    "for the sc qubit , there exists four decoherent factors : ( i ) the energy relaxation for the path @xmath139 with energy relaxation rate @xmath140 , ( ii ) the energy relaxation for the path @xmath141 with energy relaxation rate @xmath142 , ( iii ) the dephasing between energy levels @xmath89 and @xmath143 with dephasing rate @xmath144 , ( iv ) the dephasing between energy levels @xmath89 and @xmath117 with dephasing rate @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the sc qubits can be described by a master equation in lindblad form as following @xmath146+\\sum\\limits_{l}[l_l\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}(l_l^{\\dagger}l_l\\rho+\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}l_l)],\\ ] ] where , @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) is the lindblad operator . here , we have four lindblad operators as @xmath149 we plot @xmath136 versus @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) in fig . 5 ( a ) ( fig . 5 ( b ) )",
    ".    seen from fig . 5 ( a ) , @xmath136 keeps higher than 0.986 for all @xmath140 and @xmath142 satisfying @xmath154 and @xmath155 . according to fig .",
    "5 ( b ) , we have @xmath156 when @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , the scheme is also quite robust against energy relaxations and dephasings for sc qubits .",
    "however , the sc qubits is more sensitive to dephasings when using stirap , with pulses shown in eq .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) , and parameters @xmath159 , @xmath114 , @xmath160 , we have @xmath161 when @xmath162 .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , for a multi - qubit system which has an effective hamiltonian in @xmath0-type structure , the dephasings influence the sq very much when using stirap .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that with stirap , when the ratio between dephasing and coupling strength is only 0.0001 , the fidelity of the target state falls from 1 to about 0.85 .",
    "therefore , the scheme may help to improve stirap for sc qubits .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed an alternative scheme to construct a shortcut to the adiabatic passage via picture transformation for quantum transfer in a system with three - level @xmath0-type structure .",
    "different from previous works @xcite , the present scheme has its own feature .",
    "for example , schemes @xcite have adopted a serials of iterative picture transformations , while here picture transformation is used only once . besides , the ideas of schemes @xcite are to cancel the transitions between the eigenstates of iterative hamiltonian in each iterative picture , and the idea of scheme @xcite suggests to cancel the transitions between a set of chosen dressed states .",
    "but for the present scheme , we directly study the dynamics of the three - level @xmath0-type system and the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , the present scheme consider the way to construct stap from a different viewpoint .",
    "the present scheme has several advantages : ( 1 ) by choosing suitable control parameters , experimentally feasible pulses can be designed .",
    "( 2 ) the quantum transfer can be achieved without any additional couplings .",
    "( 3 ) comparing with quantum transfer with adiabatic passages , the evolution is significantly sped up with present scheme .    since the three - level @xmath0-type structure is very common in all kinds of physical systems including superconducting qubits @xcite , quantum dots or nv centers @xcite , boson gas in longitudinal coordinate coupled waveguides @xcite , atoms trapped in the cavities @xcite , etc .",
    ", the present scheme can be a choice to construct stap in these physical systems .",
    "considering the potential applications of the present scheme in experiments , we hope the present scheme may be useful in quantum information field .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the quantum transfer for the system with three - level @xmath0-type structure , and construct a shortcut to the adiabatic passage via picture transformation to speed up the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we can design the pulses directly without any additional couplings . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by choosing suitable control parameters , the rabi frequencies of pulses can be expressed by the linear superpositions of gaussian functions , which could be easily realized in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the previous works using the stimulated raman adiabatic passage , the quantum transfer can be significantly accelerated with the present scheme . </S>"
