    "due to complex structure of organic semiconductors and their spatial inhomogeneity it is nearly impossible to identify a unique scenario of current passage through them . in view of this , it is remarkable that sizable change of current through a device based on organic semiconductor takes place in weak external magnetic fields .",
    "this effect , called organic magnetoresistance ( omar ) , seems to be robust , i.e. weakly sensitive to the device parameters . although the first reports on the observation of organic magnetoresistance ( omar ) appeared decades ago@xcite , systematic experimental study of this effect started relatively recently .",
    "@xcite ( see also the review ref . ) .    on the theory side , it is now commonly accepted that the origin of omar lies in random hyperfine fields created by nuclei surrounding the carriers ( polarons ) .",
    "more specifically , the basic unit responsible for omar is a pair of sites hosting carriers ( polarons ) ; the spin state of the pair is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 here @xmath9 are @xmath10 are the spin operators of the pair - partners ( we will assume that they are electron and hole , respectively ) ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the _ full _ fields acting on the spins .",
    "they represent the sums of external , @xmath13 , and respective hyperfine fields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as was first pointed out by schulten and wolynes @xcite , due to the large number of nuclei surrounding each pair - partner and their slow dynamics , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "can be viewed as classical random fields with gaussian distributions .    in order to give rise",
    "to omar the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is not sufficient .",
    "it should be complemented by some mechanism through which the pair - partners  know \" about each other , so their motion is correlated without direct interaction .",
    "the simplest example of such a mechanism is spin - dependent recombination , i.e. the requirement that electron and hole can recombine only if their spins are in the singlet , @xmath14 , state .",
    "then the essence of omar can be crudely understood as a redistribution of portions of singlets and triplets upon increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this redistribution affects the net recombination rate .",
    "clearly , the characteristic @xmath4 for this redistribution is @xmath15 .",

    "the direction of the quantization axis , @xmath18 , is fixed by the condition @xmath19.,width=291 ]    naturally , the specific relation between the current and recombination rate involves also the rate at which the pairs are created .",
    "it is important , though , that the latter process is not spin - selective .",
    "existing theories of omar can be divided into two groups which we will call  steady - state \" and  dynamical \" .",
    "the theories of the first group@xcite appeared earlier . in a nutshell ( see ref .",

    "after that , @xmath21 is set to zero . in refs .",
    "current is expressed via the steady - state @xmath22 and subsequently averaged numerically over realizations of hyperfine fields .",
    "the  steady - state \" approach applies when the pair does not perform many beatings between @xmath14 and @xmath23 during its lifetime , since the beating _ dynamics _ is excluded by setting @xmath24 .",
    "this beating dynamics has been incorporated into the omar theory ref . , which appeared last year .",
    "this theory relies on decades old findings in the field of dynamic spin - chemistry@xcite .",
    "below we briefly summarize these findings .",
    "if an isolated pair is initially in @xmath14 , it was shown in ref . that the averaged probability to find it in @xmath23 after time @xmath25 is given either by the function @xmath26 for strong fields @xmath27 , or by @xmath28 \\right . \\\\",
