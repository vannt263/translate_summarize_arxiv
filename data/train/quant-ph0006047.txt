    "qubits are very fragile , that is the state of a qubit can easily be changed by the influence of the environment or a random error .",
    "one ( very inefficient ) way to protect the quantum information encoded in a qubit is to measure it . with the help of an optimal measurement one",
    "can estimate the state of a qubit , with an average fidelity equal to 2/3 ( see below ) . in this way a quantum information is transformed into a classical information which can be stored , copied , and processed according the laws of classical physics with arbitrarily high precision .",
    "however , in order to utilize the full potential of quantum information processing we have to keep the information in states of quantum systems , but then we are forced to face the problem of decoherence .",
    "recently it has been proposed that quantum information and quantum information processing can be stabilized via symmetrization @xcite . in particular , the qubit in an unknown state is entangled with a set of @xmath1 ( ancilla ) qubits in a specific reference state ( let us say @xmath5 ) so the symmetric state @xmath9 of @xmath10 qubits , |(|,0  ,0+|0,,  ,0+  + |0,0 ,  ) , [ 2 ] is generated .",
    "if we introduce a notation for completely symmetric states @xmath11 of @xmath10 qubits with @xmath12 of them being in the state @xmath6 and @xmath13 of them in the state @xmath5 , then the state ( [ 2 ] ) can be expressed in the simple form |(,|)= |n;0 + e^i| |n;1[3 ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are specified by the relations =  ; [ 4 ] and @xmath16 , while @xmath17 .",
    "we see that symmetric @xmath10 qubit state @xmath18 is isomorphic to a single qubit state .",
    "but in this case the information is spread among @xmath10 entangled qubits - the original quantum information is `` diluted '' .",
    "each of the qubits of the @xmath10-qubit state ( [ 3 ] ) is in the state @xmath19 .",
    "we define the average fidelity between the single state @xmath20 and the original qubit @xmath21 as = d(;)|_j(,| ) |(;)[5 ] where @xmath22 is the invariant measure on the state space of the original qubit ( i.e. we assume no _ prior _ knowledge about the pure state @xmath21 ) . for this fidelity",
    "we find the expression _ 0 = .",
    "[ 5a ] we see that for @xmath23 the fidelity @xmath24 is equal to unity ( as it should , because in this case @xmath25 ) while in the limit @xmath26 we find @xmath27 .",
    "in fact in this limit density operators of individual qubits are approximately equal to @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "individually the qubits of the symmetric state @xmath18 in the large @xmath10 limit do not carry any information about the original single - qubit state @xmath29 .",
    "so how can we extract the information from the @xmath10-qubit symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) ?",
    "the ideal possibility would be to have have a perfect _ universal _ disentangler which would perform a unitary transformation    type of disentangling transformation @xcite .    while the perfect transformation is impossible , there are a number of things we can do to concentrate the information from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath18 back into a single qubit . in principle , we have the following possibilities : * i ) * we can either optimally measure the @xmath10 qubit state and based on the information obtained prepare a single - qubit state . *",
    "ii ) * we can design a quantum disentangler which would perform a transformation as close as possible to the ideal disentangling ( [ 7 ] ) . in this quantum scenario",
    "we have several options - the process of disentanglement can be input - state dependent .",
    "this means that states ( [ 3 ] ) for some values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath30 will be disentangled better than for other values of these parameters .",
    "alternatively , we can construct a quantum device which disentangles all the state with the same fidelity .",
    "* iii ) * finally , we propose a probabilistic disentangler , such that when a specific projective measurement over an ancilla is performed at the output , the desired single - qubit state is generated .",
    "the probability of the outcome of the measurement in this case is state - dependent . in what follows",
    "we shall investigate all these possibilities .    before proceeding we note that a different type of disentangler has been considered by terno and mor @xcite - @xcite .",
    "they considered two different operations .",
    "the first would take the state of a bipartite quantum system and transform it into a state that is just the product of the reduced density matrixes of the two subsystems . the second , which is a generalization of the first , would again start with a state of a bipartate quantum system , and map it into a separable state which has the same reduced density matrixes as the original state .",
    "they showed that while both of these processes are impossible in general , they can be realized for particular sets of input states .",
    "an approximate disentangler of the first type has been considered by bandyopadhyay , et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "the disentanglers we are considering extract , to some degree of approximation , an unknown state from an entangled state formed from that state and a known state .",
    "here we first describe a measurement scenario utilizing a set of specific projection operators",
    ". then we present the optimal measurement - based approach to quantum disentanglement and we derive an upper bound on the fidelity of the measurement - based disentangler .",
    "we utilize the fact that the @xmath10 qubit system prepared in the state @xmath18 is isomorphic to a single qubit .",
    "therefore we first consider a strategy based on a a projective measurement with two projectors @xcite @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) with |_0(,)&= &     @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are chosen randomly if no _",
    "prior _ information about the measured @xmath10-qubit state is available .",
    "we can use the result of the measurement to manufacture a a single - qubit state . specifically ,",
    "if the result of the measurement is positive for @xmath37 then the single qubit is prepared in the state    @xmath38 then the single qubit is prepared in the orthogonal state @xmath39 . for a particular orientation of the measurement apparatus ( i.e. the angles @xmath40 ) this measurement - based scenario gives us a single qubit prepared in the state described by the density operator ^(meas ) ( , |;,)= _",

[ 10 ] to find the average fidelity of this measurement - based disentangling procedure we have to evaluate the mean fidelity @xmath41 , that is the overlap between the state ( [ 10 ] ) and the original input state @xmath42 averaged over all possible orientations of the input qubit : _",
    "1 = d (,)|^(est ) ( , |)| ( , ) .",
    "[ 11 ] taking into account the relation ( [ 4 ] ) we perform the integration in eq.([11 ] ) and we find _ 1 = ( 1+f_n )",

    "[ 6 ] for @xmath23 : @xmath44 which is the optimal fidelity of estimation of the state of a single qubit . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that the fidelity ( [ 12 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath10 and in the limit @xmath45 we find @xmath46 , which is equal to the fidelity of a _ random _ guess associated with a binary system such as the two projectors under consideration . in other words ,",
    "when the original qubit is diluted into an infinite qubit state of the form ( [ 3 ] ) no relevant information can be gained from the measurement .",
    "the estimated density operator ( [ 10 ] ) in this case is simply equal to @xmath47 , which is understandable , because as we have shown earlier in this limit the @xmath10-qubit state is approximately in the state @xmath48 , so information about the original is `` almost '' totally lost .",
    "we now want to find an upper bound @xmath49 for the average fidelity which can be achieved by a wide class of measurement - based disentanglement procedures .",
    "we assume that it is _ a priori _ known that our @xmath10-qubit is prepared in the symmetric state ( [ 2 ] ) with unknown parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 associated with a single - qubit state ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the integration measure on the state space of the single qubit is @xmath52 and the corresponding prior probability density distribution on this state space is constant .    our strategy is to measure the input state @xmath9 along the vector @xmath53 [ see eq . ( [ 8 ] ) ] , where the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 are chosen according to the distribution @xmath56 , which will be left unspecified for the moment . if the answer is positive , we produce the output density matrix @xmath57 , and if it is negative we produce @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath32 and @xmath60 given by eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) .",
    "we shall also leave the conditional probabilities , @xmath61 unspecified , as this allows us to consider a wide range of strategies . for a fixed @xmath53 ,",

    "this can be expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a normalized joint probability distribution , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the supremum is taken over the variables @xmath70 .",
    "we then have that @xmath71 , \\ ] ] where the supremum is now taken over @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in order to calculate this upper bound we must find explicit expressions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "after performing the necessary calculations we find for @xmath49 the expression ^max= .",
    "this fidelity for @xmath23 is equal to 2/3 while in the limit @xmath26 is equal to 1/2 .",
    "for any other @xmath10 is larger than the fidelity @xmath41 of the measurement given by eq.([12 ] ) as discussed in our previous example .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show later it is alway smaller than the fidelity of the universal quantum device .",
    "in what follows we show that a quantum disentangler which preserves quantum coherences can distill the information back to a single qubit more efficiently than can the measurement - based method . as we have already said in the introduction quantum mechanics does not allow one to construct a perfect disentangler which would perform transformation ( [ 7 ] ) for an arbitrary ( unknown ) state @xmath42 diluted in the @xmath10 qubit symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) . nevertheless , we can try to design optimal disentanglers which perform best under given constraints .",
    "so let us assume our quantum disentangler , @xmath76 , is a quantum system with a @xmath77-dimensional hilbert space spanned by basis vectors @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the disentangler is always initially prepared in the state @xmath80 , and then it interacts with the @xmath10-qubit system in the state ( [ 3 ] ) . at the output",
    "we want to disentangle the @xmath1 ancilla qubits from the original qubit , so we expect to have |(,|)|d_0|n-1;0_k=1^k _",
    "j=0 ^ 1 c_j(,| ) |j|d_k .",
    "[ 13 ] as seen from eq.([13 ] ) during the disentanglement process the entanglement between the @xmath1 ancilla qubits and the original qubit is transferred ( swapped ) into the entanglement between the original qubit and the disentangler itself . by tracing over the disentangler",
    "we then expect to obtain the best possible disentangled qubit in the state @xmath81 .",
    "now we impose several constraints which would specify what we mean by the optimal covariant ( universal ) disentangler : the fidelity between the output of the disentangler and the original state @xmath42 has to be invariant with respect to rotations of the original qubit , so the fidelity has to be input - state independent .",
    "this universality of the disentangler would then guarantee that the information from the symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) is extracted for all states equally well .",
    "we are looking for the _ optimal _ disentangler which would disentangle the information with the highest fidelity .    imposing these two conditions",
    "we have found the unitary transformation which realizes the _ optimal covariant _ disentangler , i.e. which disentangle the qubit - state @xmath29 from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath9 in the optimal and the @xmath29-state independent way ( see appendix ) .",
    "this disentangler is described by the transformation : |n;0|d_0 & & |n-1;0 ; +    basis vectors of the disentangler .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by the relation _",
    "n=()^1/2 ; _ n=. [ 15 ]    we can directly verify , that the fidelity @xmath84 is input - state independent and equal to @xmath85 . moreover , it can be shown that the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) is optimal , i.e. among all unitary transformations satisfying the given conditions the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) has the largest fidelity .",
    "we see that for @xmath23 the fidelity @xmath86 , which is obvious , because the original qubit has not been entangled with ancilla qubits .",
    "we plot @xmath87 in fig .",
    "we see , that it is _ always _ larger than the fidelity of the disentanglement via measurement . in the limit @xmath26 even the quantum disentangler gives us a totally random outcome .",
    "so in this limit , even optimal quantum entangler on which we impose the universality condition , is not able to extract information from the state ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "this is one of the main results of our paper - the optimal covariant quantum disentangler operates better than if the information is extracted ( disentangled , distilled ) from the symmetrized state ( [ 3 ] ) with the help the of optimal measurement .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath88 .",
    "one can also ask the opposite question , how can we generate out of a qubit in an unknown state @xmath29 the symmetric state of the form ( [ 3 ] ) . it can be shown that within quantum mechanics perfect universal entanglers , which would realize the inverse of the relation ( [ 7 ] ) do not exist . if one wants to create a state ( [ 3 ] ) from a qubit in an unknown state and @xmath1 ancilla qubits in the known state @xmath5 again two scenarios are possible , the measurement - based and quantum scenarios .",
    "it is not surprising that the quantum scenario works better .",
    "we have found the optimal universal ( covariant with respect to rotations of the input qubit ) quantum entangler given by the transformations : |0|n-1;0|e_0 & & ; +    basis states of the quantum entangler , @xmath89 is its initial state and the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath83 are given by eq.([15 ] ) .",
    "one can check that the fidelity between the output of this entangler described by the density operator @xmath91 and the ideally entangled state ( [ 3 ] ) is input - state independent ( i.e. does not depend on the parameters @xmath92 ) and is equal to @xmath93 .",
    "this is the best possible universal ( covariant ) entangler .",
    "the universal disentangler gives a higher fidelity than does the best measurement - based procedure , but it is not obvious that this is the best that one can do . in the case of quantum cloning ,",
    "the universal cloners are the ones which maximize the average fidelity @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , however , in the case of disentanglers this is no longer the case ; there are state - dependent devices which are better .",
    "consider the general disentangler transformation     @xmath94 , are states of the disentangler itself and need not be orthogonal .",
    "they must , however , satisfy the constraints imposed by the unitarity of the above transformation .",
    "the input state for the device is assumed to be @xmath95 , and the ideal output state , to which the actual output should be compared , is @xmath96 .",
    "the output state is calculated by starting with the input state , using the above transformation , and then tracing over the disentangler to obtain an output density matrix , @xmath97 .",
    "one then finds the average fidelity for this process , which we shall call @xmath98 , from @xmath99 note that we are assuming a specific ensemble of input states ; the probability of the one - qubit state @xmath100 is assumed to be constant on the bloch sphere .",
    "our result for the average fidelity for a state - dependent device depends on our choice of input ensemble , while for a state - independent device the average fidelity is independent of this ensemble .",
    "the calculation of the average fidelity is given in the appendix , and will not be given in detail .",
    "we find that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that the final state is just a product of the state of the @xmath10 particles and the entangler state , which means that the entangler states can be dropped from the problem .",
    "therefore , the transformation which maximizes the average fidelity is just     a kind of state swapping transformation .",
    "the average fidelity itself is given by @xmath103 , where the coefficient @xmath43 is given by eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "this average fidelity is larger than the fidelity of the optimal _ universal _ disentangler ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in this case , the fact that the universality condition forces us to use an additional quantum device , the disentangler , with which the qubit at the output becomes partially entangled , results in a net loss of information . as a result",
    "the fidelity of the universal ( covariant ) entangler is smaller .",
    "analogously , we find that quantum state - dependent entanglement can also be performed by a kind of state swapping transformation , i.e. |(,)|n;0|0    @xmath104 . nevertheless , when averaged over all values of @xmath105 we find the mean fidelity of this state - dependent entangler to be equal to @xmath43 which on average is larger than the fidelity of the state - independent entangler .",
    "let us examine a simple quantum network which takes as an input the @xmath10-qubit state ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the network is composed of a sequence of @xmath1 c - not gates @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the c - not with @xmath108 being the control bit and @xmath12 being the target bit .",
    "this sequence of the c - not gates acts on the two vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 as [ 20 ] p_n|n;0 & & |n-1;0|0 + p_n |n;1 & & ( |n-1;1+|n-1;0 ) |1from which it follows that the input vector ( [ 3 ] ) is transformed as |(,| ) & & ( |v_+| ( , ) + & & + |v_-|0 ) [ 21 ] where @xmath111 is the normalization constant . in eq.([21 ] ) we have introduced two orthogonal vectors of @xmath1 qubits @xmath112 .",
    "measurement on the first @xmath1 qubits is performed in order to determine whether they are in the state @xmath113 or @xmath114 . if the result @xmath115 is obtained , then the @xmath10th qubit is in the desired state @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of this outcome is given by p_|v_+= .",
    "[ 23 ] this probability is input - state - dependent , and it decreases with @xmath10 .    there is a difference between this probabilistic process and those considered previously , such as probabilistic cloning @xcite . those only work for set of input states which is finite .",
    "the process considered above , however , works for a continuous , and hence infinite , set of input states .",
    "it , in fact , works for all input states of the type we are considering .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the range of applicability of probabilistic devices depends on the process being considered .",
    "we have considered a number of different methods of extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed from that state and a known state .",
    "measuring the state is , as expected , the least effective method . in the case of quantum devices ,",
    "the universal device was not best one , at least if average fidelity is used as the criterion .",
    "probabilistic quantum devices were seen to work very well for this operation in that they can be used for the entire set of input states .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-9970507 , by the ist project equip under the contract ist-1999 - 11053 and by the crest , research team for interacting career electronics .",
    "let us consider the optimal quantum disentangler which acts as close as possible to the ideal transformation ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the disentangler maps the space spanned by the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 , into the space spanned by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this suggests that we consider a transformation of the following form @xmath120 where @xmath80 is the initial state of the disentangler which is supposed to be the same for all inputs and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are some unnormalized disentangler state - vectors .",
