    "surveys of young pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars based on iras colors detect mainly the classical ttauri stars ( ctt ) , due to their important dusty accretion disks .",
    "one of the most comprehensive surveys was the `` pico dos dias survey '' ( pds ) ( gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "1992 ; torres et al . 1995 ; torres 1998 ) .",
    "as the disks around the post - ttauri stars ( ptt ) should have been dissipated or agglutinated into planetesimals , they hardly would be detected in this way .",
    "they could belong to physically dispersed groups , with ages larger than the mean lifetime of the original clouds , and , in such case , they may be located far from any cloud .",
    "we discovered the first of this kind of association when we were searching for new ttauri stars ( tts ) around twhya ( de la reza et al .",
    "1989 ; gregorio - hetem et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the detection of x - ray sources by the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) associated with tts outside star formation regions ( neuhuser 1997 ) gave a new tool to find other associations of this kind .",
    "in fact , torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and zuckerman & webb ( 2000 ) , using these sources , found evidences for two young associations near the south pole , the horologium ( hora ) and the tucana ( tuca ) associations . to examine the possibility of these associations being the same and to search for other ones we undertook a survey for associations containing young - stars ( sacy )",
    "we observed more than 400 stars in the surveyed area defined in de la reza et al . in these proceedings .",
    "we obtained spectral classifications , radial velocities and equivalent width of lii lines .",
    "the lii line in late type stars can provide a first estimate for the age ( jeffries , 1995 ) , selecting possible ptt .",
    "in sacy we consider that a star is probably younger than the local association if it is located near or above the limit proposed by neuhuser ( 1997 ) .",
    "in figure1a we plot the ( u , v ) space motions of the stars with hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "there is a concentration of li - rich stars near the position ( -10 , -20 ) .",
    "choosing the 10 stars near this position ( visual binaries taken as mean values ) we obtain as the mean space velocity components : +    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath2)km / s    the mean parallax of the stars is @xmath3mas .",
    "we used the kinematical method , discribed in torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , to estimate the distances and space velocities for the stars not measured by hipparcos .",
    "in figure1b we plot the space motions , deduced in this way , of the observed stars .",
    "there is a compact core of 44 li strong stars , which are the `` probable members '' of a great austral young association ( gaya ) . in figure2a",
    "we show the histogram of the w velocities .",
    "it shows a double peak as if there are two similar associations . in figure2b and",
    "2c we show the historgrams of the distances of both groups .",
    "the group with greater w seems closer than the other .",
    "is the gaya actually split in two associations ?",
    "we made a global analysis with all stars having li line similar to or stronger than the pleiades , computing a grid of convergence points in velocity space .",
    "the above two groups stand out as the strongest concentrations .",
    "we tested also the convergence for the space velocities of the chamaeleon complex and obtained only a diffuse and little convincing concentration ( as the possible stars are spread in all the observed area ) .",
    "only four stars of the gaya could also belong to the chamaleon , but none is in its neighborhood .    in figure3",
    "we show the celestial map of the observed stars .",
    "those not in the concentration in the uv plane are evenly distributed , even the possible young ones .",
    "the proposed members of the gaya are concentrated `` near '' the south pole , between ra=21h and 9h .",
    "the gaya includes the hora and the eastern part of tuca .",
    "it is so large that it is meaningless to call it for any constellation .",
    "the gaya seems also to split in the sky , one of the groups being more concentrated to the east .",
    "but as its boudaries are not yet clearly established , and as in all diagrams and figures there is some superposition , we must wait for more observations to confirm this split .",
    "anyway , there is no clear evolutionary distinction between the groups , both being very similar , having @xmath030myr .",
    "the kinematical parallaxes give larger distances ( @xmath0150pc ) for some stars but they are unreliable .",
    "thus , the depth of the gaya , from figure2 , is @xmath070pc , implying a projected angular diameter of @xmath1 , similar to the observed size . if we suppose that the original velocity dispersion during star formation is equal to the average modulus of the velocity vectors ( @xmath01.5km / s ) , the age of the gaya would be @xmath020myr , similar to the evolutive age .    for most of the probable gaya members we obtained at least three radial velocities with no indication of spectroscopic binaries .",
    "this possible low binary frequency is intriguing and in contrast with the twa case .",
    "the surveyed area has many other young stars and they should be investigated for other possible associations , even if the global analysis does not show any other proeminent concentration .",
    "in fact , the high austral density of young stars seems to be real , being five times higher than the observed one in the region around bppsc , where in 700square degrees we found only four young stars .",
    "exploring a region covering about 30% of the southern hemisphere we found near the south pole an association of at least 44 young stars ( gaya ) , younger ( age @xmath030myr ) than most groups of the local association and older than the twa , ingulfing the hora and part of the tuca .",
    "we did not yet detect spectroscopic binaries in the gaya .",
    "the distances of the members of the gaya cover an interval of @xmath070pc , compatible with the size produced after 20myr by an initial velocity dispersion of @xmath01.5km / s , in agreement with the evolutive age .    the gaya is formed only by ptt , where none is an iras source , indicating the absence of dusty accretion disks .",
    "this suggests that , at their advanced evolutionary stage , the circumstellar disks have been dissipated or agglomerated into planetesimals .",
    "thus , the members of the gaya are privileged targets for studying the formation and early evolution of planets .    c.",
