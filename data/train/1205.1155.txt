    "usually , before considering any application , the bound state problems of non planar 2deg s are investigated @xcite .    in 1981 ,",

    "we now look for the bound states solving the schrdinger equation which comes from the k - g theory .",
    "as discussed above , we can solve this problem using the self - adjoint extension approach . from eq .",
    ", we have @xmath101 where @xmath102.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "is the modified bessel equation . in it , @xmath103 , since we are looking for bound states .",
    "notice that , different from the schrdinger theory , the inverse squared potential here is always attractive .",
    "this happens because , from eq . , the only possible case is @xmath97 . for @xmath94 ( deficit angle ) ,",
    "the gaussian curvature is positive and the short ranged potential is repulsive , meaning that we have only scattering states . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath54 the gaussian curvature is negative and such short ranged potential is negative , implying attractiveness .",
    "this is , therefore , the only case where bound states can exist .    this way",
    ", we can see the first difference between the two theories as follows . in the schrdinger one",
    ", we can have bound states for either @xmath104 or @xmath105 ( there is no possibility of having @xmath106 ) , regardless if we have a deficit ( @xmath94 ) or a proficit ( @xmath54 ) angle .",
    "for the k - g theory the only possibility is for a proficit angle , since we have only the case @xmath97 .",
    "note that this difference relies in the fact that the contribution from mean curvature is now absent in this theory .",
    "we now proceed in order to find the bound states in the k - g theory .",
    "first of all , we must determine the full domain of @xmath107 in @xmath108 .",
    "in doing so , we have to find its deficient subspaces .",
    "this is done solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "the general solution for this equation is given in terms of _ modified bessel functions _",
    ", denoted by @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , only @xmath112 is square integrable in all space .",
    "then , we have as solutions of eq . the wave functions @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the dimension of such deficient subspaces is @xmath116 .",
    "then , the wave functions @xmath85 are written as @xmath117 , \\label{eq : domain}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 , with @xmath119 . the last term in eq . gives the correct behavior of the wave function when @xmath120 .",
    "the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 represent the _ a priori _ choices of boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath123 potential determines these parameters without ambiguity .",
    "this is done by finding a fitting formula for @xmath86 @xcite : we write @xmath124 or the static solution for the problem , that is @xmath80\\phi_{0 }    + \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}u_{\\rm short}(\\rho)\\phi_{0}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : statictrue}\\ ] ]    now , we require the continuity for the logarithmic derivative @xmath125 where @xmath126 comes from eq . for @xmath124 .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation can be achieved integrating from @xmath127 to @xmath78 , @xmath128 now , considering that @xmath129 does not change significantly in the range @xmath130 $ ] , we have @xmath131 from eq . , we have @xmath132 so that @xmath133    since @xmath134 , the right - hand side of eq . is calculated using the asymptotic representation for @xmath135 in the limit @xmath136 , given by @xmath137 .",

    ", the spectrum will be determined without any arbitrary parameter @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we can go back to eq .",

    "the main difference is that now the effective angular momentum is just @xmath147 instead of the one given by eqs . and . as we noted , when @xmath94 , we have @xmath148 , that is , there is no bound states in this case .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath54 , @xmath149 and bound states can show up .",
    "because of the condition @xmath91 , the value of the proficit angle will determine which values of angular momentum are allowed . for example , if @xmath150 , then we must have @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath152 , then @xmath0 admits the values @xmath153 , and so on .",
    "now , we summarize the results of this section , that is , @xmath154 and so on .",
    "notice that the dependence of the bound states on the angular momentum @xmath0 changes significantly when compared to the dependence observed in the schrdinger theory .",
    "for example , the null angular momentum , @xmath96 , now can exist .    concluding this section , when @xmath104 and @xmath54 , the mean curvature potential is repulsive and the short - ranged potential , due to the gaussian curvature , is attractive in the schrdinger theory . on the other hand , in the k - g theory ,",
    "the absence of the mean curvature potential affects drastically the bound states of a quantum particle on a cone . in both cases ,",
    "the gaussian curvature is the sole responsible for the bound states .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , the quantum dynamics of a particle on a cone was addressed in the context of the schrdinger theory considering the da costa s approach . in this work",
    "we investigate the bound states of a quantum particle on the same surface within the k - g theory framework . in both theories ,",
    "the conical geometry provides a @xmath58-function interaction which can be either attractive or repulsive , depending on the cone parameter @xmath50 .",
    "however , in the first theory , the conical geometry introduces an inverse squared distance potential due to the mean curvature which leads to an effective potential that can be either attractive or repulsive , depending on @xmath50 .",
    "this mean curvature term does not show up when we study such system using the k - g theory .",
    "we saw in the previous sections that this difference implies profound changes for the dependence of the bound states on the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "these results are summarized in tables [ tab : table1 ] and [ tab : table2 ] .",
    ".summary of the results - schrdinger theory [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table [ tab : table1 ] , we see that , for @xmath54 , the attractive short - ranged potential ( gaussian curvature ) guarantees the existence of bound states . for @xmath94 ( repulsive short - ranged potential ) , an attractive effective potential yields a bound state for @xmath95 .",
    "however , for @xmath155 , we have only repulsive potentials and no bound states appear .    in table",
    "[ tab : table2 ] , the absence of the mean curvature makes the inverse square potential always repulsive , so the gaussian curvature is the unique responsible for the existence of bound states .",
    "they exist only when we have a proficit angle @xmath50 , that is , @xmath54 .",
    "no bound states appear in the actual cone ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this is in great contrast with the results which comes from the schrdinger theory .    in order to investigate the behavior of fermions in two dimensions ,",
    "it is important to explore phenomena like the quantum hall effect , magnetization and persistent currents in two dimensional semiconductors . for a cone",
    ", these two last physical quantities were investigated in reference @xcite .",
    "the authors did not take into account either @xmath8 or @xmath35 .",
    "but their results are correct within the k - g theory , since no potential containing the mean curvature of a cone appears and the electrons are localized on a ring far from the cone apex . however ,",
    "if we consider the schrdinger theory with the da costa s approach , the effective angular momentum now depends on an extra piece which comes from @xmath8 , as we saw above .",
    "so , measurements on the persistent current on conical surfaces can help to decide which theory is suitable to describe fermions in two dimensions .",
    "perhaps , both theories can be used depending on which material we have in hands .",
    "we must mention do not not apply to a monolayer graphene , where fermions are in fact described by a massless dirac theory .",
    "although , they could be important for quantum systems in two dimensional surfaces consisting of more than one layer , as a bilayer graphene sheet .    as a final word ,",
    "it is clear that both theories provide , theoretically , contradictory physical results .",
    "we have discussed this difference here , for quantum particles on a conical surface .",
    "the k - g theory can also change the scenario when we consider possible applications to a bilayer graphene .",
    "the authors would like to thank m. m. ferreira jr . for critical reading the manuscript .",
