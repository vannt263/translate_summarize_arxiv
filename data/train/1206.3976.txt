    "super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) of millions to billions of solar masses are believed to exist in the centre of most galaxies .",
    "the galactic center black hole candidate , sgr a * , is the closest and best studied smbh , making it the perfect source to test our understanding of galactic nuclei systems in general . this compact object was first observed as a radio source by @xcite . since then",
    ", observations have constrained important parameters of sgr a * , such as its mass and distance , estimated at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate has also been constrained by polarisation measurements , using faraday rotation arguments @xcite and is estimated to be in the range @xmath4 .",
    "other key parameters , such as the spin , inclination , and magnetic field configuration , are still under investigation .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of sgr a * have been performed from the radio to the gamma ray ( see reviews by @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , important progress has been achieved in the infrared ( ir ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) domains .",
    "all observations agree that sgr a * is a very under - luminous and weakly accreting black hole ; indeed its accretion rate is lower than has been observed in any other accreting system .    in the near future",
    ", the next milestone will be observing the first black hole shadow from sgr a * @xcite with the proposed `` event horizon telescope '' @xcite thanks to the capabilities of very long base interferometry at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "such a detection would be the first direct evidence for a black hole event horizon , and may also constrain the spin of sgr a*. in order to make accurate predictions for testing with the event horizon telescope , however , we need to have reliable models for the plasma conditions and geometry in the accretion ( in / out)flow .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations offer significant promise for this class of study , as they can provide both geometrical and spectral predictions .",
    "sgr a * has already been modeled in several numerical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of these models consist of two separate codes : a grmhd code describing the dynamics , and then a subsequent code to calculate the radiative emission based on the output of the first one .",
    "the under - luminous and under - accreting state of sgr a * ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 erg / s in the 0.5 to 10 kev band , where @xmath7 is the eddington luminosity ; @xcite ) , is the common argument given to justify ignoring the cooling losses and simplify the description of sgr a*. even though this approach seems reasonable , especially for the peculiar case of sgr a * , we propose to quantify to what extent it really applies .",
    "this question is especially important if one wants to extend these studies to more typical nearby low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) .",
    "an important example is the nuclear black hole in m87 , which is the other major target for mm - vlbi and is significantly more luminous than sgr a * ( @xmath8 ) .    to test whether or not ignoring the radiative cooling losses is a reasonable approximation , we need to take into account the radiative losses self - consistently in the dynamics , which is now possible with the _ cosmos++ _ astrophysical fluid dynamics code @xcite . by allowing the gas to cool , energy can be liberated from the accretion flow , potentially changing the dynamics of the system .",
    "the basic result that we show in this paper is that cooling is indeed negligible at the lowest end of the possible accretion rate range of sgr a * , but plays an increasingly important role in the dynamics and the resulting spectra for higher accretion rates ( relevant for most nearby llagn and even at the high end of the range of sgr a * ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the new version of _",
    "cosmos++ _ used to perform this study . in section 3 we present the initial set - up of the simulations . in section 4",
    "we show the importance of the accretion rate parameter and assess the effect of including radiative cooling . in section 5",
    "we perform a parameter survey to investigate the influence of the initial magnetic field configuration and the spin of the smbh ( we also discuss the effect of a retrograde spin on the dynamics ) on the resulting accretion disc structure and outflow . in section 6",
    "we end with our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the spectra generated from these simulations are analyzed in detail in a companion paper ( drappeau et al .",
    ", in preparation , hereafter referred to in the text as d12 ) .",
    "within _ cosmos++ _ we solve the following set of conservative , general relativistic mhd equations , including radiative cooling , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the generalized fluid density , @xmath11 is the generalized boost factor , @xmath12 is the transport velocity , @xmath13 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath14 is the 4-metric , @xmath15 is the 4-metric determinant , @xmath16 is the total energy density , @xmath17 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath18 is the specific internal energy , @xmath19 is the fluid pressure , @xmath20 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath21 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath22 is the cooling function , and @xmath23 is the covariant momentum density . with indices , @xmath24 indicates the geometric connection coefficients of the metric . without indices ,",
    "@xmath24 is the adiabatic index . for this work we use an ideal gas equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "there are multiple representations of the magnetic field in our equations : @xmath27 is the magnetic field measured by an observer comoving with the fluid , which can be defined in terms of the dual of the faraday tensor @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the boosted magnetic field 3-vector .",
    "the un - boosted magnetic field 3-vector @xmath30 is related to the comoving field by @xmath31 the magnetic pressure is @xmath32 .",
    "note that , unlike in previous versions of _ cosmos++ _ , we have absorbed the factor of @xmath33 into the definition of the magnetic fields , so - called lorentz - heaviside units ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we note that the mhd equations as written are all in the form of conservation equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represent the conserved quantities , fluxes , and source terms , respectively .",
    "these are solved using a new high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) scheme recently added to the _ cosmos++ _ computational astrophysics code @xcite .",
    "the new hrsc scheme is modeled after the original non - oscillatory central difference ( nocd ) scheme of _ cosmos _ @xcite .",
    "it also has many of the same elements as the publicly available _ harm _ code @xcite , although with staggered magnetic fields ( instead of harm s zone - centered fields ) and the inclusion of a self - consistent , _ physical _ cooling model .",
    "more details of the new scheme are provided in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , as in other , similar conservative codes , the fluxes , @xmath37 , are determined using the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) approximate riemann solver @xcite @xmath39 a slope - limited parabolic extrapolation gives @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the primitive variables at the right- and left - hand side of each zone interface .",
    "from @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we calculate the right- and left - hand conserved quantities ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , the fluxes @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the maximum right- and left - going waves speeds , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the bounding wave speeds are then @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    for stability , the equations are integrated using a staggered leapfrog method ( 2nd order in time ) .",
    "first a half - time step , @xmath50 , is taken to project the conserved variables @xmath51 forward to @xmath52 . from these ,",
    "a new set of primitives @xmath53 can be computed .",
    "these intermediate primitives are then used in calculating the fluxes and source terms needed for the full time step , @xmath54 . to find the new primitive variables , @xmath55 , after each update cycle , we use either the @xmath56 or @xmath57 numerical methods of @xcite .    along with the evolution equations , we must also satisfy the divergence - free constraint @xmath58 . to accomplish this , _",
    "cosmos++ _ now has the option to use a staggered magnetic field with a constrained - transport ( ct ) update scheme akin to the newtonian version described in @xcite .      in the present work",
    ", we assume the whole system is optically thin , i.e. radiation escapes freely from the system . however , for the calculation of the radiation we consider the appropriate optical depth of the gas at a given location and time , which depends on the state .",
    "this approximation takes into account the optical depth without performing radiative transfer , and is valid as long as the ( assumed thermal ) peak of the radiating particle distribution corresponds to energies greater than the self - absorption frequency , which is almost always the case for the regions under study .",
    "the radiative cooling term , @xmath22 , in equations ( [ eqn : en ] ) and ( [ eqn : mom ] ) , is the cooling function introduced to _",
    "cosmos++ _ in @xcite and is based on @xcite , which includes treatments of bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and the inverse - compton enhancement of each of these .",
    "since sgr a * is optically thin , we do not need to worry about multi - scattering events in the treatment of the inverse compton emission .",
    "the cooling function is calculated locally in each zone from the fluid density , electron temperature , magnetic field strength , and scale height [ @xmath59 .",
    "the local electron temperature is recovered by assuming a constant ion - to - electron temperature ratio , @xmath60 , ( fixed for each simulation ) and calculating the ion temperature from the fluid variables @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean molecular weight ( appropriate for solar abundances ) , @xmath63 is the mass of hydrogen , and @xmath64 is boltzman s constant .",
    "the temperature scale height is defined as @xmath65 .",
    "our modifications to the original @xcite cooling function are described in @xcite and are also described in more detail in our companion paper ( d12 ) .    in taking the ion and electron temperatures to be held in a fixed ratio",
    ", we are assuming there is some efficient coupling process at work between the ions and electrons .",
    "the same was done in @xcite and @xcite , except here we relax the assumption somewhat so that the coupling does not have to be exact ( @xmath60 can be greater than 1 ) .",
    "this procedure is not entirely self - consistent since the expression for ion - electron collisions in bremsstrahlung cooling [ equation ( 17 ) of @xcite ] assumes the ions and electrons have the same temperature .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath66 , we are actually underestimating the amount of bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "however , because bremsstrahlung is such a minor contributor to the cooling , this omission is not significant in the context of our current work . obviously , assuming a fixed ratio of @xmath60 is not likely to be physically accurate .",
    "however , it is the current standard in most simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recent comparisons with more sophisticated treatments has so far not shown large discrepancies ( dexter , quataert , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    because the cooling time of the gas , @xmath67 , can sometimes be shorter than the mhd timestep , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the characteristic zone length and velocity , respectively",
    ", we allow the cooling routine to operate on its own shorter timestep ( subcycle ) , if necessary .",
    "to prevent runaway loops inside the cooling function , we limit the cooling subcycle to 4 steps , with a maximum change to the specific internal energy each subcycle of @xmath71 . even with these restrictions ,",
    "the cooling has the potential to decrease the internal energy ( and hence temperature ) by up to nearly 95% each mhd cycle .",
    "our method for generating spectra is described in detail in our companion paper ( d12 ) .",
    "however , we want to mention one important point related to how we present spectra in this paper . mhd simulations of accretion discs , such as the ones used in our work , generically show significant variability due to the stochastic nature of mri - generated turbulence and magnetic reconnection .",
    "together , these effects can sometimes lead to large flares , similar to those observed in the solar corona .",
    "since our goal is to depict `` representative '' spectra , we have to make a choice about what to consider `` typical '' behavior .",
    "one option would be to produce many simulations using the same initial setup , but with different random seeds , and then select only those simulations that give desirable results .",
    "this was the procedure in @xcite .",
    "we have instead chosen a different approach , in that we perform only one simulation for each set of parameters , and then present the median spectrum for each simulation as the representative one . by choosing the median value of all spectra ,",
    "we minimize the impact of `` extreme '' episodes , especially a few very brief synchrotron / inverse compton flares that appear to be attributable to numerical limitations of the simulations , most particularly the forced axisymmetry . for error bars ,",
    "we give the `` 1-sigma '' variation about the median , i.e. the limits within which 68% of the spectra fall .",
    "for example , if we have 50 individual spectra ( corresponding to 50 different simulation times ) , as is typically the case in this work , then for each spectral energy bin , we drop the 8 highest and 8 lowest data points . in fact dropping just the 4 highest and lowest data points already gives similar results , but we use the 1-sigma values throughout .",
    "in this paper we only include spectra computed over the inner @xmath72 of the simulation domain .",
    "we have confirmed , via comparison with spectra computed using the entire simulation domain , that most of the emission comes from this inner region .",
    "the emission from the jets in our simulations is completely negligible because of their extremely low density .",
    "this extreme level of magnetic domination is likely partially a byproduct of adhering to ideal mhd , where matter can not effectively load the jets .",
    "we hope to explore the jet contribution to the spectrum more in future works .",
    "we start each simulation with a torus of gas around a compact object situated at the origin . the mass of the central compact object is set to the mass of sgr a * ( @xmath73 ) , and the initial density profile inside the torus",
    "is chosen to produce a desired mass accretion rate , somewhere in the range @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( depending on the simulation ) at the inner grid boundary .",
    "the free parameters that describe the torus are the black hole spin @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the angular momentum of the black hole and @xmath78 ) , the inner radius of the torus ( @xmath79 ) , the radius of the pressure maximum of the torus ( @xmath80 ) , and the power - law exponent ( @xmath81 ) used in defining the specific angular momentum distribution , @xmath82 we then follow the procedure in @xcite to solve for the initial internal energy distribution of the torus @xmath83 .",
    "this sets its initial temperature profile , @xmath84 . for the purpose of initialization",
    ", we assume an isentropic equation of state @xmath85 , so that now the density is given by @xmath86^{1/(\\gamma-1)}$ ] . we can then use the parameter @xmath87 to set the density ( and mass ) normalization of the initial torus .",
    "the torus is seeded with weak poloidal magnetic field loops to drive the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "the non - zero spatial components are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 & \\mathrm{for } & \\rho\\ge\\rho_{\\rm cut}~ , \\\\            0                   & \\mathrm{for } & \\rho<\\rho_{\\rm cut}~ ,           \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : torusb}\\ ] ] @xmath91 is the number of field loop centers , and @xmath92 . in this work",
    "we consider configurations with @xmath93 and 4 , as illustrated in figure [ initial_magneticfield ] , in order to investigate the effect of changing @xmath91 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 is used to keep the field a suitable distance inside the surface of the torus initially , where @xmath95 is the initial density maximum within the torus . using the constant @xmath96 ,",
    "the field is normalized such that initially @xmath97 throughout the torus , where @xmath20 is the magnetic pressure .",
    "this normalization is to ensure that the initial magnetic field is weak .",
    "this way of initializing the field is slightly different than what other groups have done , e.g. @xcite , who used a volume integrated @xmath98 , or @xcite , who used @xmath99 , to set the field strength ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of the different methods ) .",
    "we also tested one simulation with @xmath100 .",
    "the higher @xmath101 case ends up with a density ( over @xmath102 ) that is about a factor of 2 higher , a temperature that is 30 - 50% colder , a scale - height that is about 40% thinner , and a magnetic pressure that is about 50% smaller .",
    "the higher @xmath101 case contributes @xmath10370% more flux in the infrared waveband , and @xmath10386% more in the x - ray band , compared to the weaker case ( see d12 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath104 affects our final result is not surprising since our simulations do not reach a saturated ( magnetically arrested or magnetically choked ) state @xcite .",
    "our resulting field strength is dictated by how much magnetic field is made available to the black hole through our initial conditions .    in the background region",
    "not specified by the torus solution , we set up a low density non - magnetic gas .",
    "numerical floors are placed on density and energy density with the following forms : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "these floors are never applied within the disc , nor in most of the background region .",
    "they are only seldom applied very close to the outer boundary ( the few last external cells ) , and more frequently along the vertical axis in the funnel region .",
    "the most commonly applied floor is that on the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "whenever this quantity drops below 0.01 ( almost always within the jets ) , both @xmath108 and @xmath109 are rescaled by a factor appropriate to maintain this ratio .",
    "all of the simulations are performed in 2.5 spatial dimensions ( all three spatial components of vector quantities are evolved in a single azimuthal slice , although symmetry is assumed in the azimuthal direction ) using a spherical polar coordinate grid .",
    "the grid used in the majority of the simulations consists of 256 radial zones and 256 zones in polar angle .    in the radial direction ,",
    "we use a logarithmic coordinate of the form @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the radius of the black hole horizon ; therefore , @xmath112 .",
    "the inner and outer radial boundaries are set at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "note that , because we use the kerr - schild form of the kerr metric , we are able to place the inner radial boundary some number of zones ( usually 4 ) inside the black hole horizon . in principle , this choice should keep the inner boundary causally disconnected from the flow , since mhd signals can not physically radiate out from within the event horizon .",
    "this situation is preferable to having the inner boundary of the grid outside the event horizon , which can lead to artificial behavior within the flow .",
    "the spatial resolution near the black hole horizon is @xmath115 ; near the initial pressure maximum of the torus , it is @xmath116 .",
    "we use outflow boundary conditions at both the inner and outer boundaries ( the mhd primitive variables are copied from interior zones into ghost zones , except the radial velocity component , which is zeroed out if it would lead to inflow onto the grid ) .",
    "since we consider a fairly small radial range , there is some concern that our jets ( discussed in section 5.1 ) might be affected by reflections of waves off the outer boundary of the grid . to test this",
    ", we performed one simulation , b4s9t3m9ce , that used an extended radial grid with @xmath117 .",
    "we found that most properties of this simulation were very similar to the corresponding results done on the smaller ( default ) grid .",
    "the deviations were consistent with those expected from using a different random perturbation seed , as was the case here since the new simulation used a different processor distribution which affects the random seeding .    in the angular direction , we include the full range @xmath118 , with reflecting boundary conditions applied at the poles ( meaning that the mhd primitive variables are copied from interior zones into ghost zones , with the sign reversed on the @xmath119 component of all vector quantities , plus the staggered magnetic field component zeroed out at the pole ) .",
    "we use a concentrated latitude coordinate @xmath120 of the form @xmath121 with @xmath122 , which gives us a better resolution near the midplane ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "figure [ initialconfiguration ] shows the initial state of the simulation together with the grid resolution .",
    "our choice of resolution is sufficient to ensure that the fastest growing poloidal field mri modes are well resolved [",
    "@xcite ] for at least the first few orbits of the simulation .",
    "we also confirm that @xmath125 , as expected @xcite .",
    "we also performed select simulations at one - half and at double our default resolution to directly test the numerical convergence of our results ( simulations b4s9l and b4s9h in table 1 ) .",
    "we find very little variation between our default resolution ( such as in simulation b4s9 ) and its higher resolution counterpart ( b4s9h ) , suggesting our results are well converged .",
    "since our ultimate goal is to compare spectra from our simulations with actual data , our true criterion for demonstrating reasonable convergence is to compare spectra generated from simulations at different resolutions .",
    "figure [ resolutiontest ] demonstrates that simulation b4s9 , with a resolution of @xmath126 , gives a spectrum that agrees with simulation b4s9h , with a resolution of @xmath127 , to within our error bars . on the other hand , simulation b4s9l , with a resolution of @xmath128 ,",
    "produces a markedly different spectrum that diverges from the other two .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed that once a certain resolution is achieved , further increases in resolution have little effect on the spectra .",
    "because the simulations are performed assuming axial symmetry , the anti - dynamo theorem stating that an axisymmetric magnetic field can not be maintained via dynamo action @xcite , prevents the mri from being self - sustaining . after an initial phase of vigorous growth of the mri channel modes , the turbulence gradually dies out as the simulations progress",
    "this 2d approximation is a main caveat of the simulations we have run , and it is therefore important for us to carefully choose the time interval that we wish to analyse .",
    "we want it to be after the initial phase of mri growth , but before the mass accretion has begun to decay too dramatically ( longer simulation times are not necessarily beneficial in 2d for this reason ) . since we have a target mass accretion rate in mind for each simulation , we can use that as a guide for selecting our time interval .",
    "figure [ mdot ] shows the variation of the accretion rate as a function of time for three simulations that include cooling ( b4s9t3m9c , b4s9t3m8c , and b4s9t3m7c ) .",
    "we see that it takes roughly 1.5 orbits to have the accretion reach its peak value , and that the accretion dies out ( returns to the background rate ) after about orbit 5 , where we are referring to the circular orbital period at @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath130 . for these three simulations , the target accretion rates were @xmath74 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "figure [ mdot ] then suggests that an appropriate interval would be between 2.5 and 3.5 orbits .",
    "we therefore use this as the standard time interval for analysis . in the rest of this paper , @xmath133 .",
    "we confirmed that our region of interest ( @xmath134 ) has reached inflow equilibrium over this time interval , based , for instance , on the mass flux being constant as a function of radius over this region .",
    "therefore , we can also be confident that our selected time interval is late enough not to be affected by transient solutions .",
    "as we have stated , our primary goal in this paper is to assess the importance of including radiative cooling losses self - consistently in numerical simulations of llagn like sgr a*. we do this by comparing two types of simulations : those that include radiative cooling losses self - consistently in the dynamics ( indicated by a `` c '' in the simulation name or cooling `` on '' in table 1 ) and those that neglect them ( no `` c '' , cooling `` off '' ) .",
    "we performed a set of 25 different simulations to assess the importance of radiative cooling losses , as well as study the influence of parameters such as the initial magnetic field configuration , the spin , the ion to electron temperature ratio , and the mass accretion rate .",
    "table 1 summarizes all of the simulations performed .",
    "the name given to each simulation is derived from its parameter choices in the order they appear in the table .",
    "we also include the average and root mean square ( rms ) fluctuations of the mass accretion rates actually measured in our simulations .",
    "this value is to be compared with our target values of @xmath135 . in simulations without cooling ,",
    "this value is arbitrary since the initial density ( or mass ) of the disc is a free parameter ( other than the requirement that the total mass of the disc @xmath136 be negligible compared to @xmath137 since we ignore the self - gravity of the disc ) .",
    "its choice does not affect the subsequent evolution of the simulation , so can be freely rescaled after the fact .",
    "this freedom does not extend to the simulations that include cooling , since the cooling function , @xmath22 , depends directly on @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , to test different mass accretion rates , it is sufficient in simulations without cooling to do a single simulation and then simply rescale it to each of the target accretion rates , whereas in the simulations with cooling , a new simulation must be conducted for each new mass accretion rate .",
    "this physical scaling is an important distinction between our work and that of previous authors  each of our simulations with cooling has a real , _ physical _ mass accretion rate associated with it ; it is no longer a parameter that can be freely fit to the data . when comparing simulations with cooling against those without , we always assume the same initial accretion rate .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our models we start with a relatively weak ( @xmath138 ) magnetic field contained entirely within the disc , initially in the form of poloidal loops .",
    "we tested two different configurations : a single set of poloidal loops centered on the pressure maximum of the torus and following contours of pressure / density ( an example is simulation b1s9t3m9c ) and four sets of poloidal loops spaced radially , with alternating field directions in each successive loop ( an example is simulation b4s9t3m9c ) .",
    "the 1-loop configuration yields a significantly more energetic outflow ( mostly associated with the `` jets '' )  more than an order of magnitude stronger than for the more complex , though perhaps more realistic , configuration consisting of 4 initial loops .",
    "we have confirmed that , as expected , the overall power of both components scales roughly linearly with the mass accretion rate , meaning the efficiencies of the outflows are not strongly effected by the cooling .    aside from the outflow",
    ", the initial magnetic field configuration also has a strong influence on the accretion rate as seen by comparing the measured @xmath135 in table 1 for simulations b4s9t3m9c and b1s9t3m9c .",
    "the 1-loop simulation has a substantially higher average @xmath135 , as well as much larger statistical fluctuations .",
    "this difference is likely a consequence of the axisymmetric nature of these simulations . in our simulations ,",
    "accretion is driven by the mri .",
    "for the 1-loop case , the dominant channel solution is able to disrupt nearly the entire disc , driving large amounts of material onto the black hole in multiple short , intense episodes . in the 4-loop cases ,",
    "the channel solutions are restricted in their radial range and can not disrupt the disc as effectively ; accretion proceeds more smoothly , and at an overall lower normalization .",
    "[ the channel solution @xcite is a particularly violent form of the poloidal mri and is characterized by prominent radially extended features . ]",
    "these effects are illustrated in figure [ rho_1b4b ] .    ) of the system for simulations b1s9t3m9c and b4s9t3m9c at the same time step ( t= 3 orbits ) .",
    "the two simulations started with the same initial torus configuration as shown in figure [ initialconfiguration ] .",
    "the only initial difference between the two models is that the left panel started with a single magnetic loop configuration ( as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ initial_magneticfield ] ) , while the right panel started with a 4 magnetic loop configuration ( as shown in the top panel of figure [ initial_magneticfield ] ) .",
    "we can see that in the case of the single initial magnetic loop , the channel solution extends through the entire disc , resulting in a higher mass accretion rate at the black hole horizon and a more extended disk . _ _ ]    figure [ sed_b1b4_rt_median ] compares the spectra for the two different initial magnetic field configurations , the `` 1-loop '' configuration ( in black ) , and the `` 4-loop '' configuration ( in red ) .",
    "it is clear that the magnetic field configuration has a strong influence on the resulting spectra and is therefore one of the big uncertainties affecting all such models of the accretion flow .",
    "the lack of _ a priori _ knowledge of the field configuration introduces an effective error in all simulation conclusions that is comparable to the difference introduced by including cooling .",
    "thus , while we can treat the cooling losses self - consistently , it is difficult to overcome the variations that different choices in initial magnetic field configurations will introduce .    .",
    "_ _ ]      via its formation and accretion history , sgr a * is likely a rotating smbh , but as with all black holes it is currently difficult to reliably determine its spin .",
    "although the observed spectrum should depend on spin , it also depends on the mass accretion rate , which is somewhat constrained , as well as the geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "nevertheless , spectral fitting of sgr a * has already placed some meaningful constraints on the value of @xmath139 @xcite , although there can be additional complicating factors , such as disk tilt @xcite .",
    "other methods of inferring the isco , and then the spin , such as observing relativistically - broadened line profiles or modeling the thermal emission from the disc , require the presence of a geometrically thin , optically thick disc , which is not observed at the low accretion rates of sgr a*. the ultimate determination of spin will likely require future observations from mm - vlbi @xcite .",
    "we investigated the spin dependence of our results by performing simulations at six different values of @xmath139 : -0.9 , 0 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 0.9 , and 0.98 , where the minus sign indicates retrograde rotation ( disc and black hole rotating in opposite senses ) .",
    "we will discuss the effects of spin on our spectral fits in companion paper d12 .",
    "concerning the disc evolution , there does not seem to be any clear trend in @xmath135 , see table 1 . if anything there appears to be a peak in the distributions , with the highest mass accretion rates occurring at intermediate spins , @xmath140 .",
    "the outflow power on the other hand , shown in table 2 , reveals a clear trend with spin , as expected based on theoretical grounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from previous numerical work @xcite .",
    "this trend is seen in both the fluid and magnetic components of the outflow and the correlations are shown in figure [ jetkineticenergy_spin ] .    the effect of spin on jet power is a question that has been debated recently in the literature , specifically using claimed spin observations from black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "so far the observational results are not definitive ( see , e.g. , the opposing conclusions found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our results , while focusing on smbhs , would be predicted to scale to smaller mass black hole systems via the fundamental plane of bh accretion relation @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical models for the compact jets observed in weakly accreting systems predict a dependance of radio luminosity on total jet power of @xmath141 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus if we consider the total power as the sum of the fluid and magnetic components in figure  [ jetmagneticenergy_spin ] , we would also predict a correlation between observed radiative power and spin .      in all our simulations we started with the same disk thickness",
    "( @xmath142constante @xmath143 ) in order to start with a thick disk , appropriate for the galactic center .",
    "then the shape of the disk is modified during the simulation and is especially sensitive to the cooling as shown in figure [ rho_cool ] .",
    "we also investigated thinner disk simulation , the thinner disk emmit a little bit less that the thick disk but they could be compatible within one sigma .",
    "for the first time we have been able to assess the importance of the radiative losses in numerical simulations of llagn , specifically sgr a * [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "we show that radiative losses can affect the dynamics of the system and that their importance increases with accretion rate .",
    "we set a rough limit of @xmath144 , above which radiative cooling losses should be included self - consistently in numerical simulations .",
    "otherwise , many important derived dynamical quantities , such as density , magnetic field magnitude , and temperature , may be off by an order of magnitude or more , especially when the accretion rate reaches @xmath145 , which correspond to @xmath146 for sgr a*. since several recent works suggest that accretion physics is similar across the mass scale , this accretion rate in eddington units should likely be an important limit for all black holes .",
    "thus , we predict that the inclusion of self - consistent radiative cooling above @xmath147 should be important for llagn in general .    overall , this study allows us to have a more consistent model of accretion , even for the well - studied and under - luminous source , sgr a*. not only do we have a more realistic model by including the physics of radiative losses , but we are also able to show the influence of the accretion rate on the resulting spectra .",
    "the spin of the central black hole and the initial magnetic field configuration of the torus also have important consequences on the dynamics of the system and the resulting spectra . by including the cooling losses in our study",
    ", we can discuss the influence of these free parameters with more accuracy .",
    "for instance , initial magnetic field configurations consisting of a single set of poloidal loops result in significantly more powerful outflows than the four - loop cases , and we find that the jet power increases with the spin of the central black hole .    as mentioned in section [ sec : time_interval ] , there is concern as to whether or not our simulations have run long enough to reach meaningful equilibrium states .",
    "this concern is especially pertinent for our case using 2.5d simulations , as these can never truly reach a steady state .",
    "the reason is that , after a period of initial vigorous growth , the mri in 2.5d simulations steadily decays because the dynamo action that normally sustains it requires access to non - axisymmetric modes that are obviously inaccessible . we , therefore , chose a time interval for analysis when the mass accretion rate closely approximated our target value for most simulations .",
    "clearly simulations in 3d with a longer duration ( to ensure a proper equilibrium is reached ) would be beneficial , for comparison .",
    "one other concern with only performing 2.5d , axisymmetric simulations is that it precludes the possibility of exploring the effects of misalignment between the angular momentum of the gas and the black hole . in reality , most supermassive black holes are unlikely to be accreting from matter sharing the same orbital plane as the black hole spin .",
    "@xcite recently showed that accounting for such a `` tilted '' accretion flow can dramatically alter the best - fit characteristics of sgr a * and produce important new features in the spectra .",
    "as a final note , one can justify neglecting full radiative transfer in simulations of sgr a * and likely most other weakly accreting llagn because the inner regions are generally thought to be optically thin . however , to treat the outer regions of the accretion flow , or higher luminosity sources , a more thorough treatment of radiative transfer will need to be implemented into the simulations .",
    "similarly , to approach important questions such as the mass loading and particle acceleration in the jets , likely resistive ( non - ideal ) mhd will need to be considered .",
