    "an enhancement of dielectron mass spectra below the @xmath1 resonance was first observed at cern sps  @xcite and it is considered as an indication of the medium modification of the vector mesons . still the vector meson mass in matter remains an open issue   @xcite .",
    "although several scenarios like collisional broadening due to interactions with the surrounding hot and dense medium  @xcite and dropping @xmath0 meson mass associated with chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite have been discussed , there are conceivable ambiguities which have not been considered  @xcite and no conclusive distinction between them has been done .    the vector manifestation ( vm )  @xcite was proposed as a novel pattern of the wigner realization of chiral symmetry with a large number of massless quark flavors by using the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) theory , in which the vector meson becomes massless at the restoration point and belongs to the same chiral multiplet as the pion , i.e. , _ the massless vector meson is the chiral partner of the pion_. the studies of the vm in hot / dense matter have been carried out   @xcite and the vm was also applied to construct an effective lagrangian for the heavy - light mesons which can well describe the recent experimental observation on the @xmath2 mesons  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the vector dominance ( vd ) of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion  @xcite is accidentally satisfied in @xmath3 qcd at zero temperature and zero density , and that it is strongly violated in large @xmath4 qcd when the vm occurs  @xcite .",
    "the vd is characterized by the direct @xmath5 being zero . in hot / dense matter",
    ", the @xmath5 coupling is modified by medium effects and approaches 1/2 with increasing @xmath6 toward the critical point , which is due to the intrinsic @xmath6 effects associated with the chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite .",
    "this implies that _ the vd is strongly violated near the critical point , maximally by 50 % _ .",
    "it strongly affects the understanding of experiments on the dilepton productions based on the dropping @xmath0   @xcite , and recently a quantitative study has been done  @xcite . in this contribution , we focus on the electromagnetic form factor of pion and the dilepton production rate at finite temperature from the dropping @xmath0 based on the vm with paying a special attention to the effect of the violation of the vd following ref .",
    "in ref .  , the bare parameters of the hls lagrangian were determined by performing the wilsonian matching , in which the axial - vector and vector current correlators derived from the hls with those by the operator product expansion in qcd are matched at a matching scale @xmath7 gev .",
    "this procedure in hot matter provides the following proportionality between the @xmath0-meson mass and the chiral condensate near @xmath8  @xcite : @xmath9 this implies that @xmath10 is thermally evolved following the temperature dependence of the quark condensate , which is nothing but the intrinsic temperature effect .",
    "it should be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ match - input ] ) holds _ only in the vicinity of @xmath8 _ and is not valid any more far away from @xmath8 where ordinary hadronic corrections are dominant . for expressing a temperature",
    "above which the intrinsic effect becomes important , we shall introduce a temperature @xmath11 , so - called flash temperature  @xcite .",
    "the vm and therefore the dropping @xmath0 mass become transparent for @xmath12 . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that the intrinsic effects are negligible in the low - temperature region below @xmath11 : only hadronic thermal corrections are considered for @xmath13 .",
    "here we would like to remark that the brown - rho scaling deals with the quantity directly locked to the quark condensate and hence _",
    "the scaling masses are achieved exclusively by the intrinsic effect _ in the present framework .",
    "a lepton pair is emitted from the hot / dense matter through a decaying virtual photon .",
    "the differential production rate in the medium for fixed temperature @xmath14 is expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the photon self - energy @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath18 is the invariant mass of the produced dilepton and @xmath19 denotes the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "we will focus on an energy region around the @xmath0 meson mass scale in this analysis . in this energy region",
    "it is natural to expect that the photon self - energy is dominated by the two - pion process and its imaginary part is related to the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath20 through @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the square of the invariant mass and @xmath23 is the pion mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : form ] shows the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath24 for several temperatures .     + ( a ) ( b )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : form ] ( a ) there is no remarkable shift of the @xmath0 meson mass but the width becomes broader with increasing temperature , which is consistent with the previous study in ref .  . in fig .",
    "[ fig : form ] ( b ) the intrinsic temperature effect are also included into all the parameters in the form factor .",
    "at the temperature below @xmath11 , the hadronic effect dominates the form factor , so that the curves for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 agree with the corresponding ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : form](a ) . at @xmath28",
    "the intrinsic effect starts to contribute and thus in the temperature region above @xmath11 the peak position of the form factor moves as @xmath29 with increasing temperature toward @xmath8 .",
    "associated with this dropping @xmath0 mass , the width becomes narrow and the value of the form factor at the peak grows up  @xcite .",
    "as noted , the vm leads to the strong violation of the vector dominance ( vd ) ( indicated by `` @xmath30 '' ) near the chiral symmetry restoration point , which can be traced through the wilsonian matching and the renormalization group evolutions .",
    "figure  [ fig : dl ] shows the form factor and the dilepton production rate integrated over three - momentum , in which the results with vd and @xmath30 were compared .",
    "+   +   +   +    it can be easily seen that the @xmath30 gives a reduction compared to the case with keeping the vd .",
    "below @xmath11 there are no much differences , while above @xmath11 a shift of the @xmath0 meson mass to lower - mass region can be seen since the intrinsic temperature effects are turned on .",
    "the form factor , which becomes narrower with increasing temperature due to the dropping @xmath10 , exhibits an obvious discrepancy between the cases with vd and @xmath30 . the production rate based on the vm ( i.e. , the case with @xmath30 )",
    "is suppressed compared to that with the vd .",
    "one observes that the suppression is more transparent for larger temperature .    as one can see in ( c ) , the peak value of the rate predicted by the vm in the temperature region slightly above the flash temperature is even smaller than the one obtained by the vacuum parameters , and the shapes of them are quite similar to each other .",
    "this indicates that it might be difficult to measure the signal of the dropping @xmath0 experimentally , if this temperature region is dominant in the evolution of the fireball . in the case shown in ( d ) , on the other hand , the rate by vm is enhanced by a factor of about two compared with the one by the vacuum @xmath0 . the enhancement becomes prominent near the critical temperature as seen in ( e ) .",
    "these imply that we may have a chance to discriminate the dropping @xmath0 from the vacuum @xmath0 .",
    "we explored the electromagnetic form factor of pion and the dilepton production rate in the vector manifestation ( vm ) of chiral symmetry using the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) theory at finite temperature .",
    "this framework involves the intrinsic temperature effect of the lagrangian parameters which leads to the dropping @xmath10 as the vm .",
    "the form factor and the dilepton production rate receive non - negligible contributions from the intrinsic effects .",
    "a _ naive _ dropping @xmath10 formula , i.e. , @xmath31 , as well as vd in hot / dense matter are sometimes used for theoretical implications of the data . as we have shown here , the intrinsic temperature effects together with the violation of the vd give a clear difference from the results without including those effects .",
    "it may be then expected that a field theoretical analysis of the dropping @xmath0 and a reliable comparison to dilepton measurements will provide an evidence for the in - medium hadronic properties associated with the chiral symmetry restoration , if complicated hadronization processes do not wash out those changes .",
    "our analysis can be applied to a study at finite density . especially to study under the conditions for cern / sps and future",
    "gsi / fair would be an important issue .",
    "in such a dense environment , the particle - hole configurations with same quantum numbers with pions and @xmath0 mesons are crucial  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the vd has been also presented at finite density in the hls theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore the dilepton rate as well as the form factor will be much affected by the intrinsic density effects and be reduced above the `` flash density '' .",
    "nuclear many - body effects may provide a broadening and it would be important to study what happens on the dilepton production if one includes both mass shift and collisional broadening .",
    "recently the chiral perturbation theory with including vector and axial - vector mesons as well as pions has been constructed  @xcite based on the generalized hls . in this theory the dropping @xmath0 and @xmath32 meson masses were formulated and it was shown that the dropping masses are related to the fixed points of the rges , one of which gives a vm - type restoration and that the vd is strongly violated also in this case .",
    "it was proposed  @xcite that the dropping axial - vector mesons can explain the anomalous @xmath33 ratio measured in peripheral collisions by star  @xcite .",
    "based on a field theoretical way , inclusion of the effect of @xmath32 meson will be interesting .",
