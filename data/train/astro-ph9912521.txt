    "high dynamic range 5 ghz vla images by wrobel & lind ( @xcite ) have revealed twin lobes , a hot spot , and large radio halo , unusual characteristics for a bl lacertae object .",

    "nilsson et al . interpreted this as evidence for interaction between the jet and the external medium .",
    "we present here the first vlbi space observatory program ( vsop ) observations of 3c  371 .",
    "vsop observations are performed using a ground array of radio telescopes and the japanese orbiting 8 meter antenna halca ( highly advanced laboratory for communications and astronomy ) .",
    "the satellite has an orbital period of approximately 6 hours , with apogee of 21000 km and perigee of 560 km .",
    "data from halca are transmitted to a ground network of 5 tracking stations , where they are recorded and subsequently correlated with the data from the participating ground antennas .",
    "vsop observations of 3c  371 were performed on 1998 march 11 ( 1998.19 ) and 1998 may 16 ( 1998.37 ) at a frequency of 4.8 ghz .",
    "nrao s very long baseline array ( vlba ) provided the ground array for both observations ( with the exception of the st .",
    "croix antenna , which did not participate in the may observation ) .",
    "the data were recorded in vlba format with two intermediate - frequency bands ( if ) , centered on 4.800 and 4.816 ghz , each with a bandwith of 16 mhz , and correlated in socorro .",
    "the total durations of the observations were 9.5 ( march ) and 8 ( may ) hr , each covering somewhat longer than one halca orbit .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the _ uv_coverage obtained for each epoch , where the baselines to halca are clearly visible , providing an improvement in the resolution by more than 3 times that obtained using only the ground telescopes .",
    "since the observational resolution is proportional to the frequency of observation , similar values can also be obtained by ground arrays at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the reduction of the data was performed within the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software .",
    "data with very discrepant amplitudes and/or phases on all baselines to a given antenna were deleted .",
    "fringe fitting was performed to solve for the residual delay and fringe rate , resulting in good solutions for most of the halca data .",
    "after averaging all frequency channels the data were exported into the software difmap ( shepherd 1997 ) .",
    "an initial time average of 10 seconds was introduced prior to phase calibration with a point source model .",
    "a further time average of 2 minutes was introduced before imaging .",
    "imaging was performed through successive cleaning and self - calibration of the data , both in phase and amplitude . in order to study the inner milliarcsecond structure of 3c  371 with the highest resolution provided by vsop , we imaged the data using uniform weighting",
    ". the more extended structure was revealed by making use of the ground data only , and with natural weighting .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the uniformly weighted vsop and naturally weighted vlba images obtained for 3c  371 at 1998 march 11 and 1998 may 16 .",
    "components in the total intensity images were analyzed by model fitting the _ uv _ data with elliptical gaussian components within difmap . because of the smooth jet structure and non uniformity of the @xmath6coverage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , model fitting was rather complicated .",
    "owing to the difficulty of using model fitting to reproduce both very compact and more extended structure , we adopted the following approach . starting with the hybrid map delta - function model , we deleted components within 7 mas of the core and then reconstructed the inner jet by model fitting with elliptical gaussian components .",
    "because of the complex structure of knots _ k1 _ and _ k2 _ in the outer region , model fitting of these components was accomplished by removing the delta - function components within the highest contour levels surrounding their respective positions , then model fitting the residuals with single elliptical gaussians for each component .",
    "we have estimated the positional errors in the model fitting by introducing small changes in the position and studying the variations in the @xmath7 of the fit , as well as by reproducing the model fitting from the beginning and comparing with previous results .",
    "this yielded uncertainties of @xmath00.05 mas for the inner components _ a _ through _ d _ , and @xmath0 0.1 mas for knots _ k1 _ and _ k2_. table 1 summarizes the physical parameters obtained for 3c  371 at both epochs .",
    "tabulated data correspond to flux density ( @xmath8 ) , separation ( @xmath9 ) and structural position angle ( @xmath10 ) relative to the core , fwhm major axis of the ellipical gaussian component ( @xmath11 ) , ratio of minor to major axis ( @xmath12 ) , and position angle of the major axis ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the possible existence of superluminal motions in the jet of 3c  371 is controversial owing to the different values estimated by several authors .",
    "worrall et al . ( @xcite ) fit the total millimeter to x - ray spectrum of 3c  371 to the synchrotron - self - compton jet model of knigl ( @xcite ) , obtaining a lower limit of 10 for the doppler beaming factor , @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the bulk flow speed of the emitting plasma in units of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath10 is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight . under the assumption that @xmath18 , they predicted superluminal motion with values larger than 10 @xmath19c ( @xmath20= 100 @xmath21 km s@xmath1 mpc @xmath1 ) .",
    "similar values were suggested by lind ( @xcite ) through the analysis of two 5 ghz vlbi images obtained in 1982 and 1985 . a study of the changes in brightness distribution led these authors to conclude that the apparent speeds were between 6 and 7 @xmath19c .",
    "however , vla observations by wrobel & lind ( @xcite ) show that the morphology of the extended radio emission of 3c  371 is that of a double - lobed radio source .",
    "since the lobes do not overlap , the viewing angle can not be extremely small .",
    "on the other hand , they detected no counterjet , which suggests that the source does not lie near the plane of the sky .",
    "it is therefore difficult to obtain an agreement between the large viewing angle estimated by wrobel & lind ( @xcite ) , and the large apparent motions of worrall et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and lind ( @xcite ) , since apparent motions of the order of 10 would require a viewing angle smaller than approximately @xmath22 .",
    "thus , a direct determination of the apparent proper motion is of special importance for interpreting this source .",
    "the vlba natural - weighted images of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show a jet extending to the west - southwest over about 60 mas .",
    "superimposed on the homogeneous jet brightness distribution , knots _",
    "k1 _ and _ k2 _ appear at @xmath0 12 and 26 mas from the core . the computed apparent motions of 1.2 and 0.3 mas / yr ( 2.8 and 0.7 h@xmath1c ) for _ k1 _ and _ k2 _ , respectively , lie within the estimated errors .",
    "we therefore obtain an upper limit to the apparent velocity of the large scale jet structure of @xmath0 3 h@xmath1c .",
    "comparison with previous 5 ghz vlbi maps by lind ( @xcite ) obtained in 1982 and 1985 reveals a tentative identification of _",
    "k1 _ and _ k2 _ with their components _ c _ and _ e _ , respectively , in which case both components would have remained stationary over a 15-yr period , in discrepancy with the value of 7 h@xmath1c estimated by lind ( @xcite ) .    the vsop images of fig",
    ". [ fig2 ] reveal up to four distinct components , mapped with an angular resolution of @xmath0 0.26 mas , which for this nearby source corresponds to a linear resolution of @xmath0 0.4 h@xmath1 pc .",
    "the apparent velocities for components _ a _ through _ d _ range between 0.4 and 1.2 @xmath19 c. however , the relatively large errors in the model fitting of this complex source ( see also gabuzda et al .",
    "@xcite ) lead to an estimated error in the apparent motion of @xmath2 c , and therefore we can only conclude that any motions in the inner structure of 3c  371 must be smaller than this uncertainty .",
    "our rather low upper limit to the apparent velocity of the inner jet requires that either ( 1 ) the lorentz factor is low , ( 2 ) the viewing angle is large , ( 3 ) the lorentz factor is high but the viewing angle is small , @xmath23 , or ( 4 ) the knots in the jet are stationary features .",
    "we assume that the absence of counterjet emission in the images of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is due to beaming of an otherwise symmetric twin jet , and estimate a minimum observed jet : counterjet emission ratio of @xmath24 ( peak flux : noise level ) . in the case of",
    "_ optically thin _",
    "emission in a steady - state jet with randomly oriented magnetic field , this ratio is given by @xmath25^{2-\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath26 is the spectral index ( @xmath27 ) ; @xmath28 in 3c  371 ( taylor et al .",
    "we note that for jet regions with relatively large opacity , such as the brightest region of the radio core , the above equation is not valid , and the jet : counterjet flux ratio is significantly smaller than that obtained using the previous equation .",
    "therefore , the use of this equation provides a lower limit to the flow lorentz factor , and a corresponding upper limit to the viewing angle .",
    "solving the jet : counterjet flux ratio equation gives @xmath29 , or @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 .",
    "hence , if the jet is symmetric , we can eliminate possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "option ( 3 ) seems unlikely , since the twin - lobe extended radio structure ( wrobel & lind @xcite ) is not easily explained if the viewing angle is much less than @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we conclude that option ( 4 ) is the most plausible , especially if we consider the previously mentioned opacity effects in the determination of the jet : counterjet flux ratio .",
    "further strong evidence supporting the idea that the components may be stationary features comes from the comparison with images of similar resolution obtained by kellerman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the vlba at 15 ghz ( see http://www.cv.nrao.edu/2cmsurvey ) .",
    "these images show a knotty jet with only minor structural changes during the four years covered by their observations , and resembles the structure of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "similar to the radio galaxy 3c  120 ( walker @xcite ; gmez et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the jet of 3c  371 displays a gentle curvature .",
    "sharper bends are observed farther downstream of the emission shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( wrobel & lind @xcite ; akujor et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; these have been interpreted as the interaction of the jet with the external medium ( nilsson et al .",
    "the fact that knots _ k1 _ and _ k2 _ are offset with respect to the jet ridge line supports this interpretation .",
    "they may arise from kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( as seems to be the case in 0836 + 710 ; lobanov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or perhaps some other consequence of strong interactions with the external medium ( cf . 3c  120 ; gmez , marscher , & alberdi @xcite ) .",
    "if the jet of 3c  371 is confined by the pressure of the external medium , the slow motion ( consistent with no motion ) observed in components _ d _ through _ a _ suggests that these components may be associated with recollimation shocks .",
    "numerical simulations by gmez et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) show that the enhancement of specific internal energy and rest - mass density at internal oblique shocks results in the appearance of a regular pattern of knots of high emission .",
    "the separation and strength of the knots is a function of the jet opening angle and mach number .",

    "this would lead to the physical conditions ( high energy electrons and acceleration ) necessary in order to explain the optical jet observed in this source ( nilsson et al .",
