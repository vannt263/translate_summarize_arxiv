    "it is well established that the many - body properties of one or two dimensional systems @xcite are qualitatively different from those of three dimensional ones . generally ,",
    "interacting systems in low dimensions exhibit intriguing properties , for example , exotic phenomena such as quantum hall effect and high temperature superconductivity occur in electrons in two dimensions ( 2d ) . over the last three decades",
    ", low dimensional phenomena have been extensively studied in condensed matter systems . with the recent advent of ultracold atoms in highly anisotropic traps , new perspectives of low dimensional physics with trapped atoms have arisen @xcite .",
    "an ensemble of harmonically trapped noninteracting ultracold atoms becomes kinematically two dimensional in @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions ( one dimensional in @xmath8 direction ) when the temperature and the chemical potential of the ensemble are much lower than the harmonic trapping frequency in the tightly confining @xmath8 direction ( frequencies in @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions ) .",
    "in such a 2d ( 1d ) trap , the atoms essentially occupy the ground states ( state ) of the harmonic oscillators in the tightly confining directions ( direction ) .",
    "then , the deviations from the purely 2d ( 1d ) physics are expected to arise only from interatomic interactions .",
    "the effects of tight trapping or lower dimensions on bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have attracted a great deal of research interests , both theoretically [ 3 - 9 ] and experimentally [ 10 - 13 ] ever since the first realization of atomic bose - einstein condensation in 1995 .",
    "one unique advantage for research with ultracold atoms is that one can alter interactions between the atoms over a wide range by a magnetic feshbach resonance [ 14 - 16 ] this provides an opportunity for exploring many - body physics with tunable interactions @xcite .",
    "though , most of the recent experimental works on ultracold atomic gases with tunable @xmath1-wave scattering length are carried out in 3d traps , it is possible to study tunable two - body interactions in highly anisotropic or lower dimensional traps @xcite .",
    "the effects of confinement due to tight anisotropic trapping on atom - atom cold collision are an interesting topic of research in cold atom science .",
    "confinement induced resonances in quasi - one dimension due to strong confinement along transverse directions for any value of 3d scattering length have been discussed theoretically by olshanii @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated by moritz et al .",
    "@xcite that , cold atoms trapped in quasi-1d traps can form confinement induced dimers .",
    "petrov and shlyapnikov @xcite have discussed quasi-2d and 3d regimes of atom- atom scattering in a trap that is tightly confined in axial direction .     for @xmath9 ( solid line ) , @xmath10 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath11 ( dotted lines)for the fixed parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13,width=336 ]    usually , two - body interaction in dilute atomic gases at low temperatures is modeled with a zero - range contact potential . in such an approach ,",
    "the actual two - body interaction is replaced by a delta - type pseudo - potential v_pseu = ( ) [ pseudo ] where @xmath2 represents the energy - independent @xmath1-wave scattering length , @xmath14 is the reduced mass of two colliding atoms and @xmath15 denotes the separation between the two particles .",
    "this is valid for a class of two - body potentials which have finite @xmath2 in the zero energy limit .",
    "the essential idea behind this approach is to deal with a simple potential that is capable of reproducing the total two - body elastic scattering amplitude in the limit of the collision energy tending to zero . the @xmath1-wave scattering amplitude @xmath16 for collision wave number @xmath17 is related to the @xmath1-wave scattering phase shift @xmath18 by f_k = and @xmath2 is related to @xmath19 by the well - known bethe s expansion formula @xcite @xmath20 = -\\frac{1}{a_s } + \\frac{1}{2 } r_0 k^2 + ...   \\label{expan}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the effective range .",
    "near a scattering resonance , @xmath2 diverges and so the potential , shown by expression ( [ pseudo ] ) , becomes ill - defined .",
    "this means that the delta function potential can not rigorously describe the phenomena that occur near a scattering resonance .",
    "however , an improved treatment of resonant phenomena can be done in terms of the regularised delta function potential derived by lee _",
    "_ @xcite have obtained an exact solution and bound - state energy spectrum for two ultracold atoms interacting via zero - range regularized delta potential in an isotropic 3d harmonic trap .",
    "idziaszek and calarco @xcite have found an exact solution of two interacting particles in an axially symmetric trap within pseudopotential approximation .",
    "@xcite have argued that the applications of the exact solutions obtained in ref.@xcite are limited to the sufficiently weak traps the width of which is much larger than @xmath21 . to circumvent this limitation , bolda and coworkers @xcite",
    "have used an energy - dependent scattering length in a regularised pseudopotential and developed a self - consistent method to calculate two - atom bound state in an isotropic trap , and to study @xmath1-wave collisions in an optical lattice with quasi - one and two dimensional harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "@xcite have theoretically studied ultracold collisions between metastable helium atoms in tight harmonic traps using energy - dependent scattering length based self - consistent as well as quantum defect theoretic numerical integration methods .",
    "the purpose of our investigation is to understand how a finite - range resonant two - body interaction can affect two - body bound states in low dimensional traps . to this end",
    ", we use a class of finite - range model potentials which do not diverge as @xmath22 and do not require any regularisation . to treat the effects of large scattering length in a tightly confined trap , our model potentials does not require any assumption of an energy - dependent scattering length .",
    "these model potentials are based on the expansion ( [ expan ] ) and derivable by the method of gelfand and levitan @xcite .",
    "we show that there exists two such finite - range model potentials - one for @xmath3 and the other for @xmath4 . in the limits",
    "@xmath22 , both potentials reduce to the same form .",
    "the finite - range model potential for @xmath23 is well - known and used earlier by carson _",
    "@xcite for quantum monte carlo simulation of a homogeneous superfluid fermi gas , and by also shea _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to study the energy spectrum of two interacting cold atoms in an isotropic harmonic trap . following the work of jost and kohn @xcite",
    ", we introduce an analytical form of the potential for @xmath24 that can smoothly match with the other potential for @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "this means that these two potentials can account for the entire regime of low - energy interactions from large positive to the large negative scattering length for any arbitrary range of interactions .",
    ".[abrefs ] ground - state energy eigenvalue @xmath27 ( in unit of @xmath28 ) of two atoms interacting with the model potentials with @xmath29 in an isotropic 3d harmonic oscillator for different values of @xmath0 ( in unit of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the frequency of the isotropic harmonic oscillator ) applying numerov method in one case and hamiltonian matrix diagonalisation method in another case . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 2 we display a few low lying energy eigenvalues with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 of eigenstates of two interacting particles in a quasi-2d ( @xmath34 ) and 2d ( @xmath35 ) traps for different values of @xmath2 but for fixed @xmath36 . from this table",
    "several inferences can be drawn .",
    "first , the deviation of the ground - state energy in the interacting case with positive @xmath2 from that in the noninteracting case ( @xmath37 ) is more prominent compared to the similar case with negative @xmath2 . in contrast , as we have observed from figs 1 and 2 , that the modification in ground - state wave function at or near the centre of the 2d trap ( @xmath38 ) due to an increased negative scattering length is larger than that due to an increase in positive scattering length by the same amount .",
    "this means that an attractive interaction i.e. negative scattering length has more prominent effect on the central probability density than on the ground - state energy , while the reverse is true for repulsive interaction i.e. positive scattering length .",
    "second , as the positive @xmath2 increases , the energies increase while for increasing negative @xmath2 the energies decrease .",
    "for both the limits @xmath26 and @xmath39 , the energies approach to the same value .",
    "third , the decrease of energies with lowering of @xmath40 , as can be noticed from this table , can be attributed to the deviation from 2d nature .",
    "fourth , the change in @xmath2 alters the ground state energies more prominently rather than the excited state energies implying that the interactions have the most significant effects on the ground state .",
    "fifth , this table also shows that the interactions have quite small influence on the bound states with @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the interactions have pronounced effects on bound states with @xmath41 .",
    "since 2d harmonic oscillator wave functions for @xmath42 go to zero as @xmath43 , short range interactions between two atoms can hardly affect those oscillator states .",
    "now , we discuss how good are the conditions of large @xmath40 that we have used to describe quasi-2d or 2d regime of the traps .",
    "we numerically solve eq .",
    "( 16 ) to know how significant are the effects of axial excitation with @xmath44 on the ground - state energy and wave function . in table 3",
    "we compare ground - state energies for the two cases @xmath45 and @xmath46 and 2 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 for 3 values of @xmath2 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath47 the ground - state energy for @xmath46 and 2 cases deviates by more than 7% from that for @xmath45 case , while the corresponding deviation in case of @xmath48 is about 2% .",
    "we display the effects of this axial excitation on the ground - state wave function in figs . 5 and 6 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we observe that in both the cases the deviation of the wave function is small near the trap centre and near the edges , while in the intermediate radial separations the deviation for @xmath47 is quite significant , but for for @xmath48 the deviation is small and may be ignored for all practical purposes .",
    "from this analysis , we may infer that while for @xmath49 one can not ignore axial excitations and has to consider full 3d picture , in case @xmath50 the effects of axial excitations on the ground - state properties are quite small . for @xmath51 ,",
    "one may describe a quasi-2d regime where one can approximately calculate the ground state eigenenergy by ignoring the effects of axial excitations .     for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath48 considering @xmath54 ( solid line ) and @xmath46 ( dashed line).,width=336 ]",
    "in conclusion we have presented the results of a microscopic model study on the effects of the range and the scattering length of a class of two - parameter model potentials on the properties of trapping bound - state of two atoms in a quasi-2d trap . as discussed in the introduction part , the range @xmath0 of atom - atom interaction in the pseudo - potential approximation",
    "is usually neglected . however ,",
    "when @xmath22 which is identified as `` unitarity limit '' in current cold atom literature , the only length scale available for expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) is the effective range @xmath0 . in this limit",
    ", the range of interaction and the momentum dependence of @xmath1-wave scattering amplitude may not be negligible .",
    "finite range of two - body interactions is also important in the context of dipolar systems such as magnetic dipolar atoms or electric polar molecules which have long - range and anisotropic interactions .",
    "recently , physics of cold polar molecules have attracted tremendous research interests because of the long - range nature of their intermolecular interactions .",
    "furthermore , ultracold polar molecules in 2d trap may serve as an intriguing system for exploring new physics with anisotropic interactions . in view of these recent developments in the frontier areas of ultracold atoms and molecules",
    ", the results of this study may be useful to develop an understanding of microscopic picture about those finite - ranged interactions in 2d trap the counterpart of which in 3d corresponds to the tunable fano - feshbach resonances ."
