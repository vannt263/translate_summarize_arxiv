    "observational and theoretical studies of mixing and oscillations are typically concerned with neutral particle states .",
    "important examples are neutral meson mixing , the oscillations of standard model ( sm ) neutrinos  @xcite and leptogenesis through the mixing of sterile right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) in the early universe  @xcite . in contrast , for charged particles in the sm at vanishing temperature , mass degeneracies between different states are not strong enough to produce observable phenomena of mixing and oscillations .",
    "this does however not preclude the fact that these effects are present in principle .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the mixing of lepton doublets ( which are gauged ) can be of importance for leptogenesis  @xcite : at high temperatures , the asymmetries are in general produced as superpositions of the lepton doublet flavour eigenstates of the sm . in the sm flavour basis , this can be described in terms of off - diagonal correlations in the two - point functions , or alternatively in effective density - matrix formulations in terms of correlations of charge densities of different flavours . at smaller temperatures , interactions mediated by sm yukawa couplings",
    "become faster than the hubble expansion , such that the flavour correlations decohere . in particular , the sm leptons receive thermal mass corrections as well as damping rates that lift the flavour degeneracy . by now , these effects have been investigated in detail .",
    "it turns out that due to the interplay with gauge interactions , the flavour oscillations that may be anticipated from the thermal masses are effectively frozen , while the decoherence proceeds mainly through the damping effects , _",
    "i.e. _ the production and the decay of leptons in the plasma  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate treatment of these flavour correlations turns out to be of leading importance for the washout of the asymmetries from the out - of - equilibrium decays and inverse decays of the rhns .    the origin of the charge - parity ( @xmath0 ) asymmetry for leptogenesis is usually attributed to the rhns and their couplings  @xcite . in the standard calculation , when describing the production and the decay of the rhns through @xmath5-matrix elements , one can diagrammatically distinguish between vertex and wave - function terms .",
    "the presence of finite - temperature effects as well as the notorious problem of correctly counting real intermediate states in the boltzmann equations  @xcite have motivated the use of techniques other than the @xmath5-matrix approach : it has been demonstrated that the wave - function contribution can alternatively be calculated by solving kinetic equations ( that are kadanoff - baym type equations which descend from schwinger - dyson equations , see refs .",
    "@xcite on the underlying formalism ) for the rhns and their correlations , or equivalently , by solving for the evolution of their density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the vertex contributions to the decay asymmetry can be obtained within the kadanoff - baym framework as well , as it is shown in refs .",
    "we note at this point that it has more recently been argued that the asymmetry from the wave - function correction and the contribution from the kinetic equation are distinct contributions that should be added together  @xcite . however , it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the kinetic equations derived from the two - particle irreducible effective action capture all contributions of relevance for the @xmath0 asymmetry at leading order , which also encompasses the wave - function corrections .",
    "the calculations for leptogenesis based on schwinger - dyson equations on the closed - time - path ( ctp ) can also be applied to leptogenesis from oscillations of light ( masses much below the temperature ) rhns  @xcite , also known as the ars scenario after the authors  of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    ", we can interpret the @xmath0 violation as originating from cuts of the one - loop self energy of the rhns , that are dominantly thermal .",
    "it can be concluded that thermal effects can largely open the phase - space for @xmath0-violating cuts that are strongly suppressed for kinematic reasons at vanishing temperature .",
    "putting together the elements of flavour correlations for charged particles and of thermal cuts , we can identify new sources for the lepton asymmetry , in addition to the one from cuts in the rhn propagator . in models with multiple higgs doublets",
    ", higgs bosons may be the mixing particles  @xcite , whereas in minimal type - i see - saw scenarios ( with one higgs doublet ) , this role can be played by mixing sm lepton doublets  @xcite . yet , the rhns remain of pivotal importance because due to their weak coupling , they provide the deviation from thermal equilibrium that is necessary for any scenario of baryogenesis .",
    "while the set of free parameters of the type - i see - saw model will remain underconstrained by present observations and those of the foreseeable future , the parameter space in that scenario is still much smaller than in models with multiple higgs doublets . for our phenomenological study , we therefore choose to consider the mixing of lepton doublets in the see - saw scenario , that is given by the lagrangian @xmath6    in short , the scenario of baryogenesis from mixing lepton doublets can be described as follows  @xcite : flavour - off diagonal correlations from the mixing of active leptons @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the flavour index ) can induce the production of lepton flavour asymmetries , corresponding to diagonal entries of a traceless charge density matrix in flavour space .",
    "different washout rates for the particular flavours may then lead to a net asymmetry in total lepton number , _",
    "i.e , _ a non - vanishing trace of the charge density matrix .",
    "now , since off - diagonal correlations due to mixing vanish in thermal equilibrium , the mixing of lepton doublets that we aim to describe consequently is an out - of - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "it is thus natural to assume that initially , when the primordial plasma is close to thermal equilibrium , all correlations between the sm lepton flavours vanish .",
    "therefore , we are interested in possibilities of generating these dynamically . due to gauge interactions ,",
    "the distribution functions of the sm particles should track their equilibrium forms very closely .",
    "moreover , gauge interactions are flavour - blind , so they can neither generate flavour correlations nor destroy these ( up to the indirect effects that we discuss below ) .",
    "sizeable off - diagonal correlations can however be induced through couplings to the rhns @xmath9 , the distributions of which can substantially deviate from equilibrium .",
    "the flavour correlations in the doublet leptons @xmath10 are suppressed however due to the sm yukawa couplings @xmath11 with the charged singlets @xmath12 and the higgs field @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and where @xmath15 is the totally antisymmetric @xmath16 tensor . by field redefinitions",
    ", we can impose that @xmath11 and @xmath17 are diagonal , which is a common and convenient choice of basis that we adapt throughout this present paper . for simplicity , we therefore write @xmath18 .    in this paper , within section  [ sec : freezeout ] , we first review the scenario of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we improve on the previous discussion by introducing a diagrammatic representation of the mechanism .",
    "moreover , we carefully discuss the generation and the decoherence of lepton flavour correlations at different temperatures , paying particular attention to the fact that both effects take a finite time to fully establish .",
    "section  [ sec : surveys ] contains a survey of the parameter space of baryogenesis from mixing lepton doublets based on the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) . under the assumption that only two rhns are present",
    ", we perform a comprehensive scan , given the present best - fit values on the light neutrino mass differences and mixing angles , such that we can identify the point in parameter space that allows for the lowest reheat temperature for which an asymmetry in accordance with observation can result .",
    "in addition , we show that for three rhns , substantially smaller temperatures can be viable , what requires however anomalously large yukawa couplings of the @xmath19- and the @xmath20-leptons and a cancellation in their contributions to the mass matrix of the light neutrinos .",
    "the analysis is however restricted to the strong washout regime , such that it remains an open question of interest whether favourable parametric regions also exist when at least one of the rhns induces only a weak washout .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a detailed derivation of the source term for the asymmetries of the individual lepton flavours is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ctp method is employed . here",
    ", we do not reiterate these technical details , but we explain the qualitative form of the main results with the help of a diagrammatic representation of the kadanoff - baym equations that arise from the ctp approach . in particular , we express the perturbative approximations to the solutions of these equations diagrammatically .",
    "moreover , we discuss how the mixing of the sm lepton doublets in the ctp formalism can be related to a density matrix formulation of flavour oscillations , that should be familiar _",
    "e.g. _ from the problem of oscillations of active neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "c + ( a ) +   +   + ( b ) +   +   + ( c )    -.4 cm    the ctp formulation of the problem leads to kadanoff - baym equations , that we show here in a diagrammatic form in figure  [ fig : schwingerdyson](a ) .",
    "one may interpret the kadanoff - baym equations as ( a subset of ) exact schwinger - dyson equations , that can only be solved approximately in practice .",
    "since couplings can be assumed to be weak , a perturbative one - loop expansion , that is indicated by figures  [ fig : schwingerdyson](b ) and ( c ) , amounts to a valid approximation .",
    "we can assume that kinetic equilibrium is established by fast gauge interactions .",
    "the distribution functions and the propagators of the sm leptons @xmath10 are therefore effectively determined by the matrix @xmath21 of the charge densities of @xmath10 and their flavour correlations  @xcite .",

    "we emphasise that however , the source from active lepton mixing is different from the source from rhn oscillations , and while the favoured parametric configurations bear similarities in the pattern of yukawa couplings , for given masses of the rhns , the main contributions to the asymmetries are generated in both scenarios at very different temperatures , _ cf .",
    "in this work , we have investigated in some detail the possibility of generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe from the mixing of lepton doublets within the sm extended by two or three rhns . for this purpose ,",

    "the lower mass bound on the rhns and consequently on the reheat temperature can be evaded through a certain alignment of the yukawa couplings @xmath71 , that allows these to be relatively large while the masses of the light active neutrinos remain small , which is possible in the presence of three rhns , _ cf .",

    "smaller gauge couplings would therefore lead to a larger asymmetry .",
    "on the other hand , the size of the gauge couplings does not have a leading influence on the asymmetry for standard leptogenesis  @xcite .",
