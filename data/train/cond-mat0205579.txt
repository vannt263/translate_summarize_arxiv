    "time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite is an attractive first - principles formalism for the calculation of electronic response properties . thanks to its simplicity , applications to quantum wells  @xcite and atoms  @xcite have appeared long before its formal justification ,  @xcite and currently its use is ubiquitous in a wide range of _ ab initio _ computations",
    ". a crucial ingredient of successful tddft applications is the approximation to the _ dynamic _ exchange - correlationkernel , @xmath0 which together with the hartree kernel  @xcite @xmath1 completely determines the two - particle interaction effects . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the adiabatic local - density approximation ( lda ) kernel , @xmath3}{d      n({{\\mathbf r}})},\\ ] ] has been almost exclusively adopted in practical calculations .",
    "however , the scope of the lda kernel has been rather limited for infinite periodic solids due to its deficiencies , and in particular its incorrect non - divergent long - wavelength behavior for insulators has been emphasized as a primary defect in recent years .",
    "@xcite this shortcoming of the lda kernel shows up , e.g. , in its incapability of describing excitonic effects in absorption spectra of solids .",
    "the semilocal generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) kernel does not improve over the lda one in this case , and the task of developing a more accurate approximate exchange - correlation  kernel remains as a challenging task for the tddft study of solids .",
    "indeed deficiencies of the lda and gga appear already at the level of the _ static _ exchange - correlation  energy functional @xmath4 $ ] and the exchange - correlation  potential @xmath5 / { \\delta n}({{\\mathbf r}})$ ] .",
    "for instance , the lda and gga @xmath4 $ ] inherently fails to describe the quasi - two - dimensional electron gas due to their ( semi)local nature .",
    "@xcite for @xmath6 and the corresponding kohn - sham ( ks ) eigenvalues , the lda and gga @xmath6 incorrectly decays exponentially rather than as @xmath7 for localized systems , and consequently their highest occupied orbital energies are too high and unoccupied orbital energies do not exhibit rydberg series . for solids ,",
    "the lda band gaps are too small and this behavior is again not corrected by the gga .",
    "in fact , even the exact ks gap does not equal the experimental band gap but differs by the discontinuity of the exchange - correlationpotential .",
    "@xcite however , recent theoretical and numerical studies suggested that the ks equation for @xmath8 electrons corresponds to the dyson equation where the reference ground state is chosen with @xmath9 electrons ,  @xcite and accordingly unoccupied orbitals in the ks calculations should give a good description of excitations of the @xmath8-electron system with fixed particle number .",
    "this is in accordance with the perturbation theory along the adiabatic connection  @xcite which finds that differences of ks eigenvalues represent the leading term in the expansion of excitation energies .    in this",
    "regard , recent development of the ks exact - exchange ( exx ) method , which treats the exchange - correlation  energy functional exactly in leading order in the electron - electron interaction , provides an interesting opportunity .",
    "self - interaction - free , nonlocal exx schemes give not only realistic exchange potentials and ks eigenvalue spectra for molecules  @xcite but also band structures of semiconductors in good agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite we have recently shown that the exx orbitals and eigenvalues at the one - particle level without any previously applied post - dft modification such as the quasiparticle shift  @xcite indeed give a very good description of the absorption spectrum of semiconductors with the exception of excitonic features resulting from two - particle interactions , and argued that it is another evidence of the above - described picture of `` ks quasiparticles '' .",
    "@xcite    in view of the encouraging performance of the exx method , we present in this work an exact expression of the exx kernel @xmath10 for periodic insulators which can be employed for calculations of electronic linear response properties within tddft .",
    "it will be shown that the exx kernel , unlike the lda and gga kernels , exhibits a long - wavelength behavior of the exact @xmath2 which is particularly important for the study of electronic excitations in infinite solids .",
    "this behavior of the exx kernel has been previously claimed by goshez _",
    "based on a plausibility argument ,  @xcite and here we explicitly prove this using our exact formula .",
    "we first establish the definitions and notations of various quantities of interest and derive the long - wavelength behavior of the exact @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the full linear density response matrix @xmath11 describes the response of the first - order ( number ) density change @xmath12 for the given bare dynamic perturbation @xmath13 , @xmath14 we chose to work in the reciprocal space and the frequency domain , e.g. , @xmath15 is a matrix in the reciprocal - space lattice vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the given wave - vector @xmath18 and frequency @xmath19 .",
    "analysis of the @xmath20 behavior of the `` head '' ( @xmath21 ) , `` wing '' ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 or vice versa ) , and `` body '' ( @xmath24 and @xmath23 ) elements of @xmath11 and other related matrices appearing below is an important discussion point throughout the paper . from now on",
    ", we will adopt the matrix notation and @xmath16 dependence will be assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise . within tddft , @xmath12 is expressed in terms of the dynamic linear response matrix @xmath25 and the first - order change of the effective ks potential @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath26 is composed of the external perturbation @xmath13 and the resulting change in the hartree potential @xmath28 and the exchange - correlation  potential @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\ ,      { \\delta n}({{\\mathbf q}};\\omega ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 .",

    "the quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 as well as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 all consist of a leading _ @xmath18-independent _ term and contributions of higher order in @xmath45 which vanish in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chi0-chitilde ] ) and ( [ eq : chi - q0 ] ) , one can deduce that the head and wings of @xmath2 have the following divergent @xmath20 behavior  @xcite ( assuming that there exists no fortuitous cancellation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 in eq.([eq : fxc - q0 ] ) , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 again contain a leading _ @xmath18-independent _ term and contributions of higher order in @xmath45 which vanish for @xmath20 .",
    "the head and wings of adiabatic lda and gga kernels , on the other hand , are independent of @xmath45 and thus are incorrectly non - divergent for @xmath20 : @xmath61 this defect is a serious problem not only from a theoretical viewpoint but also for practical purposes because the head and wings of the exchange - correlation  kernel can affect the the macroscopic dielectric function in leading order .",
    "@xcite for example , it has been recently shown that they play a crucial role for the proper treatment of excitonic effects in the calculation of optical spectra .",
    "deficiencies of the lda and gga kernels discussed above represent a major problem from the theoretical and calculational point of view which could not be overcome so far .",
    "to ameliorate the situation we propose to adopt the exx kernel .",
    "an exact expression of the exx kernel has been previously derived by one of us for localized systems for the case of real - valued orbitals .",

    "now we analyze the physical meaning of @xmath64 and relate it with the gw approximation ( gwa)-bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) approach ,  @xcite which represents at the moment the most successful first - principles computational scheme of electronic excitations in solids .",

    "@xcite    the expression of the full @xmath64 is admittedly quite complicated .",
    "however , we point out that a simplified picture of the important underlying physical processes within tdexx can be extracted by noting that only the first term of @xmath92 ( @xmath121 ) and the first and third terms of @xmath95 ( @xmath122 ) are dominant contributions at resonant @xmath19 .",
    "this is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hx_resonant ] .",

    "consider calculation of the full response function  @xcite or excitation energies  @xcite with tdexx and gwa - bse .",
    "replacing the bare coulomb interaction with the screened coulomb interaction , the resonant terms of @xmath95 effectively shift the exx eigenvalue spectrum toward that of the gwa , while the resonant terms in @xmath92 are the counterparts of those occurring in the bse in the tamm - dancoff approximation .    in the above comparison",
    ", it is interesting to observe that while the gwa and bse have a clear hierarchy as the theory of independent quasiparticle excitations  @xcite and electron - hole excitations , terms related to both excitation effects appear within the dft formulation at the time - dependent level and the distinction between one- and two - particle excitations is accordingly rather arbitrary .",
    "we should also mention that the mapping between tdexx and gwa - bse is not exact because the @xmath101 terms do not have counterparts in the gwa - bse .",
    "these differences may indicate the inherently different nature of tddft and the gwa - bse approach .    in summary , we derived the expression of the exx kernel for insulators and showed that it has a long - wavelength behavior as the exact @xmath2 unlike the lda and gga kernels .",
    "the common conception that dft is not suitable for the study of electronic excitations of solids was mainly derived by adopting _",
    "qualitatively _ incorrect lda and gga potentials and kernels and the difficulty of going beyond them . coupled with the already available exx potential ,",
