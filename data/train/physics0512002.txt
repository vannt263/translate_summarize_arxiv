    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) provides a spectrum simultaneously for each spatial sample of an extended , two - dimensional field .",
    "basically , an ifs is located in the focal plane of a telescope and is composed by an integral field unit ( ifu ) and a spectrograph . the ifu acts as a coupler between the telescope and the spectrograph by reformatting optically a rectangular field into a quasi - continuous pseudo - slit located at the entrance focal plane of the spectrograph .",
    "therefore , the light from each pseudo - slit is dispersed to form spectra on the detector and a spectrum can be obtained simultaneously for each spatial sample within the ifu field .",
    "the ifu contains two main optical sub - systems : the fore - optics and the image slicer .",
    "the fore - optics introduces an anamorphic magnification of the field with an aspect ratio of 1@xmath02 onto the set of slicer mirrors optical surfaces . in such way",
    "each spatial element of resolution forms a 1@xmath02  pixels image on the detector ( i.e. the width of each slice corresponds to 2 pixels ) , which ensures correct sampling in the dispersion direction ( perpendicular to the slices ) and prevents under - sampling the spectra .",
    "this anamorphism can be avoided if under - sampling spectra is acceptable by science ( for example , the snap  @xcite project ) or if a spectral dithering mechanism is included in the spectrograph in order to recover for the under - sampling .",
    "the image slicer optically divides the anamorphic ( or not ) two - dimensional field into a large number of contiguous narrow sub - images which are re - arranged along a one - dimensional slit at the entrance focal plane of the spectrograph .",
    "an image slicer is usually composed of a slicer mirror array located at the image plane of the telescope and associated with a row of pupil mirrors and a row of slit mirrors .",
    "the slicer mirror array is constituted of a stack of several thin spherical mirrors ( called `` slices '' ) which `` slice '' the anamorphic field and form real images of the telescope pupil on the pupil mirrors .",
    "the pupil mirrors are disposed along a row parallel to the spatial direction .",
    "each pupil mirror then re - images its corresponding slice of the anamorphic field on its corresponding slit mirror located at the spectrograph s focal plane ( slit plane ) .",
    "the slit mirrors are also diposed along a row parallel to the spatial direction . finally , each slit mirror which acts as a field lenses , re - images the telescope pupil ( pupil mirrors ) onto the entrance pupil of the spectrograph .",
    "the principle of an image slicer is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : principle ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfe ] , we consider the distribution of the theoretical wfe ( t - wfe ) of both fan - shaped and classical image slicers",
    ". the t - wfe of the fan - shaped image slicer is about 45.5@xmath1  nm and the t - wfe of the classical image slicer is about 76.1@xmath2  nm . it is interesting to note that the fore - optics ( see section  [ sect : design ] ) provides a mean t - wfe of about 45.7  nm over the whole fov ( marked by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfe ] ) .",
    "thus , the fan - shaped image slicer preserves the image quality of the fore - optics over the whole fov ( all channels ) while the classical image slicer degrades the t - wfe by a factor two in certain channels .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the t - wfe of the fan - shaped image slicer is sharp since the range of values is about  8  nm over all channels allowing to guaranty a negligible level of differential aberration in the field .",
    "this article presents an original concept of image slicer called `` fan - shaped '' .",
    "its design delivers good and homogeneous image quality over all ifu elements .",
    "we successfully apply its design to jwst / nirspec .",
    "here we did nt discuss about manufacturing aspects since the performance aspects were preponderant however further investigations are under studying to drastically reduce costs and manufacturing aspects in such a design by preserving performances . furthermore , a prototyping of the ifs ( ifu and spectrograph ) for the snap application is undergoing at lam  @xcite ."
