    "baryons are physical objects of great interest .",
    "their properties and interactions are essential to understand those of the atomic nuclei or of more exotic kinds of systems like the strange matter , which is believed to play a role in the macroscopic properties of astrophysical objects , e.g. neutron stars  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", baryon phenomenology allows to study the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is a great scientific endeavor to understand the extremely rich spectroscopy and structure of baryons directly from the few parameters of qcd , namely the strong coupling constant and quark masses .",
    "additionally , their weak decays and reactions provide information on the flavor structure of the electroweak interactions that eventually may point out departures from the standard model ( sm ) predictions in baryonic observables .",
    "experiments on baryon spectroscopy , structure , decays or reactions are currently taking data or are planned in laboratories like cern - sps , gsi , etc , and new facilities will be soon available at j - parc , tjnaf , lnf , etc . moreover , the last few years have witnessed an impressive development in the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) description of several observables and realistic results on baryon structure are starting to appear  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the investigation of baryon phenomenology by means of the low - energy effective field theory of qcd , namely chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt )  @xcite , has been troubled for a very long time because of several conceptual and technical problems like the poor convergence of the perturbative ( chiral ) series or the effects of the lowest - lying decuplet resonances .",
    "recently , we have shown that a fairly good convergence is possible using a lorentz covariant approach within a renormalization prescription of the loop - divergencies which recovers the power counting  @xcite and is consistent with analyticity  @xcite .",
    "we have systematically incorporated the decuplet resonances taking care of the power - counting and @xmath2 problems  @xcite",
    ". a model - independent understanding of diferent properties including the magnetic moments of the baryon - octet  @xcite , the electromagnetic structure of the decuplet resonances  @xcite and the hyperon vector coupling @xmath0  @xcite , has been successfully achieved .",
    "moreover , the quark mass dependence of lqcd results on the baryon masses has been studied in this approach  @xcite , providing an extrapolation to the physical point that is better than using a linear extrapolation .",
    "we will briefly review these developments stressing the role they may play in the future .",
    "the magnetic moments of the baryons are of the utmost importance since they contain information on the internal structure of baryons as read out by electromagnetic probes .",
    "a starting point is the @xmath3-symmetric model of coleman and glashow ( cg )  @xcite that describes the baryon - octet magnetic moments in terms of two parameters .",
    "the success of this model relies on the almost preserved global @xmath4-symmetry of qcd with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 flavors .",
    "the description of the symmetry - breaking corrections to the baryon magnetic moments can be addressed in a systematic and model - independent fashion by means of @xmath1pt . in this approach",
    ", the cg result appears naturally at leading - order ( lo ) as tree - level . at next - to - leading ( nlo ) order",
    ", there are only loop - contributions that depend on known couplings and masses and , therefore , no new undetermined low - energy constants ( lecs ) besides those appearing in the cg approach are to be included .",
    "the question is then whether the @xmath3-breaking corrections to the baryon - octet magnetic moments can be successfully addressed from a first principles approach by means of @xmath1pt ; namely whether or not the chiral loops improve the classical cg results .",
    "a positive answer to this question has been given only recently  @xcite when applying the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) renormalization scheme  @xcite which is an extension of @xmath8 developed to overcome the power - counting problem in the baryon sector of @xmath1pt .",
    "for a detailed presentation of our results and their comparison with heavy baryon ( hb )  @xcite or infrared ( ir )  @xcite formulations of baryon @xmath1pt , see refs .",
    "the comparison of our results with those obtained before stresses the importance in su(3)@xmath9-@xmath1pt of the relativistic corrections and of keeping unaltered the analytic properties of the theory . concerning the inclusion of the decuplet resonances ,",
    "@xmath10 contributions that do not spoil the improvement over cg were found only in the eoms framework and when the unphysical degrees of freedom contained in the relativistic spin-3/2 vector - spinor were removed by means of the @xmath11 couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that we obtain a good convergence since the nlo contribution is , at most , about one half of the lo one , what is consistent with our @xmath12 expectation that the contribution is of the order of @xmath13 .    the aforementioned covariant approach that includes",
    "both octet and decuplet contributions has also been applied to the description of the electromagnetic structure of the decuplet resonances  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the magnetic dipole moments of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are predicted using the well - measured one of the @xmath16 to fix the only lec appearing up to nlo @xmath17 where the error bars are an estimation of higher - order contributions obtained looking at the ratio between nlo and lo contributions ( we take @xmath18 of the nlo over lo ratio )  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these results lies on the ongoing efforts from the experimental side to measure the magnetic moments of these two resonances  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "calculations from many different approaches have arisen in the last decades  @xcite .",
    "our results are compatible with the values quoted by the particle data group  @xcite and the agreement with the latest experimental analysis , @xmath19  @xcite , is excellent . finally , the electromagnetic properties related with the higher - order multipoles in the expansion of the spin-3/2 electromagnetic vertex , namely the electric quadrupole moment and the magnetic octupole moment , have been also predicted  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a reliable combination of lqcd and @xmath1pt becomes a powerful framework to understand hadron phenomenology from first principles and may have sound applications .",
    "this can be illustrated in the scalar sector with the determination of the sigma terms from the analysis of the masses through the hellman - feynman theorem , @xmath20 in table  [ table : ressigmasb ] we present the results on @xmath21 and @xmath22 after fitting the lecs to the pacs - cs and lhp results and with the uncertainties determined as has been discussed above for the masses .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained within the cut - off renormalized b@xmath1pt .",
    "in this work we have reported the recent progress that has been achieved in the model - independent description of diverse baryon phenomenology by means of @xmath1pt .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that a reasonable chiral convergence can be achieved using a lorentz covariant approach to b@xmath1pt that systematically includes decuplet contributions .",
    "the electromagnetic structure of the baryons , the vector hyperon coupling @xmath0 and the baryon masses comprise the properties studied so far . besides giving a successful description of the experimental data concerned in these examples , the relativistic corrections have shown to be necessary in order to understand the quark mass dependence of the lqcd results on the baryon masses .",
    "further applications of the lorentz covariant approach in baryon phenomenology and in the analysis of lqcd simulations are foreseeable .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that this approach has been extended to heavy - light systems  @xcite .",
