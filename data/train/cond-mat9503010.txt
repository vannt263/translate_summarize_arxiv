    "there is a widespread belief that strong electron - electron correlations in the high - t@xmath0 compounds may hold a clue to the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity.@xcite one of the manifestations of these correlations is in the fact that the insulating parent compounds are antiferromagnets .",
    "an important probe of antiferromagnetism is magnetic raman scattering.@xcite its prominent signature in the underdoped high-@xmath3 materials is a two - magnon peak observed at about @xmath4 .",
    "to first approximation , this peak can be attributed to inelastic scattering from the two - magnon excitations.@xcite in fact , raman experiments yielded the first estimate of the exchange interaction constant in @xmath5 .",
    "the two - magnon peak has also been observed in the electron - doped materials@xcite and more recently@xcite in the underdoped @xmath6 materials ( up to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the traditional framework for understanding the two - magnon raman scattering in antiferromagnets has been an effective hamiltonian for the interaction of light with spin degrees of freedom known as the loudon - fleury hamiltonian@xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the polarization vectors of the in- and outgoing photons , @xmath11 is the ( generally poorly known ) coupling constant , and @xmath12 is a vector along the bond connecting two nearest neighbor sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this equation has been reexamined in recent years to better account for a possible importance of quantum fluctuations , the four - magnon processes , and the further neighbor terms.@xcite    the loudon - fleury theory is expected to work well when the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing photons are considerably smaller than the gap between conduction and valence bands .",
    "the experimental reality in high-@xmath3 materials is such , however , that the two - magnon scattering is observed mostly in or near the so - called resonant regime , when the frequencies of the ingoing and/or outgoing photons are close to the gap value .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that the experiments are mostly done with the visible or near ultraviolet lasers , while the gap and the upper hubbard band states lie in the same range of frequences ( roughly between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) in the high-@xmath3 materials .",
    "the experimental cross - sections vary strongly in this range of incident photon frequencies,@xcite and it becomes an issue whether the loudon - fleury hamiltonian is still applicable .",
    "whatever the answer to this question , we still need to have the means of evaluating the variation of the overall scale of the coupling constant @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with the incident photon frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the profile of the raman cross - section as a function of the _ transferred _ photon frequency is shown in fig .",

    "the behavior of the two - magnon peak height as a function of the _ incident _ photon frequency is presented in fig .",
    "[ peak ] , where the absorptive part of the dielectric constant is also shown for comparison .",
    "the key experimental features that require explanation are the following :    in fig .",
    "[ twom ] :    \\(a ) _ asymmetry of the two - magnon peak profile _ : the two - magnon peak is asymmetric , with the spectral weight shifted to higher frequencies .",
    "\\(b ) _ selection rules _ : loudon - fleury hamiltonian predicts no scattering in the @xmath17 configuration ; experimentally in the resonant regime the @xmath17 cross - section is about half of that in the @xmath18 geometry .",
    "\\(c ) _ stability of the two - magnon peak profile _ : as the incident photon frequency changes over the frequency range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , the two - magnon scattering intensity profile merely scales with incident frequency , without a noticeable change in shape .",
    "( however , at higher photon energies , a distortion of the raman spectrum occurs . )    in fig .",
    "[ peak ] :    \\(a ) _ a single peak _ : ordinarily one might expect two peaks , the so called ingoing and outgoing resonances,@xcite and here only one is observed .",
    "\\(b ) _ peak location _ :",
    "a comparison with the dielectric constant shows that the strength of the two - magnon raman scattering is at its maximum away from the band edge , in fact right at the upper end of the features in the optical data that can be interpreted as the particle - hole excitations between the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "( phonons , on the contrary , are known to resonate with the features in the dielectric constant.@xcite )    raman scattering in a one - band model of correlated electrons has been considered several times in the literature.@xcite shastry and shraiman@xcite have recently given a derivation of the loudon - fleury hamiltonian starting from the usual large-@xmath21 hubbard model .",
    "working in a localized basis , they performed a hopping expansion controlled by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath21 are the nearest - neighbor hopping and on - site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath24 is of the order of the photon frequencies .",
    "the leading term in the expansion turned out to be the loudon - fleury hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .    a simple , though somewhat crude interpretation of this outcome is to envision spins in a classical neel state .",
    "the incoming photon is absorbed by moving , say , a down spin to the neighboring site occupied by an up spin .",
    "the up spin then returns to the formerly down site , emitting the outgoing photon .",
    "the overall result is light scattering accompanied by the nearest neighbor spin exchange , which is encoded in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ shastshrproc ] .    notice that the intermediate state in this process has a doubly occupied site , and is thus of order @xmath21 above the ground state in energy . when the photon energy is far smaller than @xmath21 , no further precision in specifying the intermediate state s energy",
    "is needed , and the leading order term is sufficient .",
    "when @xmath25 becomes of order @xmath23 ( resonant regime ) , all of the terms in the expansion in @xmath22 are of the same order , and the leading term can no longer provide a solution .",
    "however , it is in this regime that the cross - secions sensitively depend not just on the magnetic , but also on the carrier properties , and this makes it a especially important to the field of high - t@xmath0 superconductivity .    we will discuss the form of the raman vertex in both the nonresonant and resonant regimes later in the paper and here merely note that , on physical grounds , the multiple hops affect the single - particle green s function in two distinct ways .",
    "first , the multiple hops is a way to generate the band structures of the doubly occupied sites and holes , i.e. , they produce a dispersion in the coherent part of the single - particle green s function .",
    "second , they produce a distortion of the spin background around each hole which gives rise to the incoherent part of the green s function . since resonance is a phenomenon contingent upon the vanishing of the denominators in perturbation theory , it is plausible to assume that the incoherent parts of the green s functions are of lesser importance .",
    "we thus model our particle and hole green s functions as fully coherent , but having a certain dispersion , which at half - filling we take to be that of the spin density wave ( sdw ) solution of the hubbard model.@xcite we regard our ability to address the experimental results on the basis of this dispersion relation as partial evidence of the validity of the sdw picture not only for the antiferromagnetism , but also for the hole dynamics .",
    "we wish to stress that this is not a trivial distinction .",
    "there have been many interesting theoretical studies of the single hole problem in the hubbard and the t - j models .",
    "however , even such a basic feature as the band structure of a single hole has not been experimentally tested .",
    "indeed , in the low - doping regime the holes are trapped near the dopant sites . even in the translationally invariant case",
    ", the phonon polaron effects  @xcite could still destroy the hole dispersion predicted on the basis of purely electronic models .",
    "resonant raman scattering right at half - filling is sensitive to the details of the dispersion of the fermionic quasiparticles and thus provides an experimental information about the single hole dispersion without having to dope the material .    before proceeding to the description of our calculations",
    ", we would like to make two comments about the model we use .",
    "first , in this paper we exclusively consider the one - band hubbard model .",
    "this by itself is a simplification , since in the  first - principles \" calculation one would start with a three - band model for the @xmath26 unit . within this model , the lowest gap ( about @xmath15 )",
    "is a charge - transfer gap between @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands.@xcite however , it is generally accepted that at energies comparable to this gap the hybridization between @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbitals is relevant , and one can effectively describe the system by a single degree of freedom per @xmath26 unit , which in turn implies that the three - band hubbard model can be reduced to an effective one - band hubbard model.@xcite the relevant parameter which allows the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom is the splitting of the triplet and singlet states of the @xmath28 and @xmath27 spins in the zhang - rice theory.@xcite their estimate of this splitting is several electron volts , and thus the singlet states relevant to our analysis are well - separated from the triplet states .",
    "this is corroborated by the measured behavior of the dielectric constant .",
    "for example , in gdcuo@xmath29 there are strong absorption features in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant around @xmath30 and around @xmath31 , but only a featureless continuum in between.@xcite we therefore expect that the one - band hubbard model already captures all the essential physics of raman scattering up to photon energies of order @xmath32 .    our second comment concerns the hopping term in the hamiltonian . in this paper ,",
    "we restrict our model to contain only the nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath23 .",
    "meanwhile , it was suggested  @xcite on the basis of the photoemission data for @xmath33 , that the next - nearest - neighbor hopping term in the 123 compounds is rather large , @xmath34 . for @xmath35-based compounds , @xmath36 was estimated@xcite to be @xmath37 . at finite doping ,",
    "the restriction to only the @xmath23 term requires care , as the spin - density wave theory ( which we will use in most of our considerations ) is meaningless near the minima of the quasiparticle band , unless one takes into account the self - energy corrections which lift the degeneracy of the quasiparticle spectrum along the reduced brillouin zone boundary.@xcite fortunately , as we will see below , the two - magnon raman scattering in cuprates is not a phenomenon that is associated with the minima of the quasiparticle band , and therefore the details of the quasiparticle dispersion right near those minima will not be important in our analysis .",
    "for this reason , we believe that for a qualitative analysis of raman scattering in cuprates , one can use the simplest model with just the nearest - neighbor hopping .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii discusses the general formalism of the two - magnon raman scattering in antiferromagnetic insulators . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the nonresonant scattering . in particular , we show how the results of shastry and shraiman are reproduced in the sdw formalism .",
    "we will also discuss the location and shape of the two - magnon peak .",
    "iv is the main part of the paper .",
    "we argue that the phenomenon of multiple resonance , described in detail in that section , is a way to explain the unusual features in figs .",
    "[ twom ] and [ peak ] .",
    "we study the singularities of the integrals corresponding to that type of resonant behavior , and present the relevant calculations . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we present a comparison with the experimental results and state our conclusions .",
    "some technical details of our calculations are contained in the appendix .",
    "some of the results of this work have been already presented in a short paper.@xcite",
    "we start with the general theory of magnetic raman scattering in the hubbard model .",
    "the one - band hubbard hamiltonian is @xmath38 a straightforward procedure to derive the coupling of light to the fermions in this model was recently described by shastry and shraiman.@xcite in the presence of the slowly varying vector potential @xmath39 , each fermion operator acquires a phase @xmath40 , and the hopping term gets transformed into @xmath41 the vector potential is supposed to vary slowly on lattice scales , and one can then approximate the phase factor by @xmath42 substituting this into the expression for @xmath43 and expanding in powers of the vector potential , one obtains upon transforming to the momentum space @xmath44 where the current and the stress - tensor operators are @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the electron dispersion , @xmath47 the vector potential can be quantized in the usual way @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the light frequency .",
    "the velocity of light is several orders of magnitude larger than the fermi velocity , and therefore we can safely set the momenta of photons equal to zero .",
    "consider now separately the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) , which contain the vector potential .",
    "the last term is already quadratic in @xmath51 , so for photon scattering we have to consider only the first - order contribution from it",
    ". this contribution does not lead to resonant scattering and , at least in the resonant regime , can be neglected compared to the resonant scattering from the first term . for this reason we neglect the last term in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) in this paper , and focus only on the first term which leads to photon scattering in the second order of perturbation theory .",
    "this second - order scattering process involves an intermediate particle - hole state of the fermionic system which can emit or absorb collective bosonic excitations before collapsing into the outgoing photon . in particular , in the two - magnon resonant scattering",
    ", a photon with the energy @xmath1 is injected into the antiferromagnetically ordered set of electrons .",
    "this photon creates a virtual particle - hole pair which then emits two spin - waves with momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and then annihilates into an outgoing photon with the energy @xmath54 .    ignoring the polaritonic effects",
    ", the raman scattering cross section@xcite is obtained from the lowest - order golden rule @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energies of the initial and final states of the system ( @xmath58 is a total frequency of two magnons in the final state ) , and the summation over the final states @xmath59 includes the integration over the photon momenta .",
    "further , @xmath60 is a matrix element , given by @xmath61 .",

    "our primary goal will be to calculate the dependence of this matrix element on the incident photon frequency .    for completeness , we also list a number of possible experimental scattering geometries.@xcite they differ in the polarizations of the incident ( @xmath9 ) and scattered ( @xmath10 ) photons . for the linearly polarized light ,",
    "the scattering geometries are @xmath63 for the circularly polarized light , the scattering geometries are @xmath64 the scattering in each geometry measures a particular combination of the components of the scattering tensor .",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath60 into four one - dimensional representations of the 2d square lattice symmetry group @xmath65 : @xmath66 then , the scattering in the experimental @xmath17 geometry measures a combination of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the scattering in the @xmath18 geometry measures a combination of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , etc . in the two - magnon raman scattering ,",
    "the energy transfer @xmath71 is small compared to the gap between conduction and valence bands . in this situation ,",
    "the dominant components of the scattering tensor are found experimentally to be those of @xmath67 and @xmath69 symmetry.@xcite it is therefore sufficient to study scattering in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 experimental geometries .    the states in the general expression of eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) for the matrix element are the full many - body states of the system , which contain both the electronic and spin excitations .",
    "therefore , to fully describe the two - magnon raman scattering we will need two different types of vertices .",
    "the first is the interaction between the vector potential of light and the fermionic current density  this vertex is given in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) .",
    "the second is the interaction between the fermions and the spin - waves .",
    "a convenient way to express both types of vertices on equal footing is to use the spin density wave ( sdw ) formalism@xcite to describe the electronic state at half - filling and the excitations around it . in the sdw formalism ,",
    "one introduces a long - range order in @xmath72 with @xmath73 and uses it to decouple the hubbard interaction term .",
    "the diagonalization then yields two bands of electronic states ( the conduction and valence bands ) with the gap @xmath74 in the strong coupling limit that will be assumed throughout this work .    in terms of the conduction and valence band quasiparticle operators @xmath75 and",

    "the restriction to only such diagrams can be justified if one extends the original @xmath107 hubbard model to large @xmath108 by considering 2s orbitals at a given site.@xcite at half - filling this extension transforms the hubbard interaction term into the hund s rule coupling which favors the maximum possible spin @xmath108 at each site .",

    "the sdw spin susceptibility has been considered several times in the literature.@xcite since the unit cell is doubled due to the presense of the antiferromagnetic long range order , we have two susceptibilities  one with zero transferred momentum , and one with the momentum transfer @xmath111 .",

    "the standard way to treat the effects of multiple magnon - magnon scattering in the raman problem is to write the heisenberg hamiltonian in terms of the holstein - primakoff bosons , diagonalize it , and keep only the interaction term @xmath161 , which is responsible for multiple scattering of two magnons in the vacuum ( fig .",

    "the way to avoid this complication is , again , to study the large-@xmath108 limit .",
    "the key point is that at infinite @xmath108 the raman intensity is divergent at @xmath163 , which is the maximum possible two - magnon frequency .",

    "now , if @xmath108 is large , the shift in the two - magnon raman peak position due to the magnon - magnon interactions is small , so that one can still consider magnons as free particles and neglect the anomalous part in the quadratic form .",

    "we see that in the resonant regime , the new diagrams are larger by a factor @xmath213 . however , this estimate , while correct for the large-@xmath108 case , can be somewhat misleading at the physically relevant value of @xmath107 , as it does not take into account strong self - energy and vertex corrections which are relevant at @xmath214 , even though we are considering the situation exactly at half - filling .",

    "the order of magnitude estimates therefore only point to the new diagrams as being comparable in importance at resonance to those that fully dominated away from the resonance .",

    "the most singular integral will dominate .",
    "notice that because the singularity comes only from the coherent part of the quasiparticle spectral weight @xmath225 , we do not need to consider incoherent part of @xmath225 , which by itself can be substantial and spread over the energy scale exceeding @xmath193 ( some studies predict that @xmath225 spreads over the scale of the order @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is a number @xmath228 ) .",
    "we now consider in detail the singular behavior of various diagrams .",

    ".    we will present a detailed study of the momentum integration near the triple resonance in the next subsection , and here merely note that , unlike its single counterpart , the triple resonance is not tied to the minimum of either @xmath100 or @xmath241 .",
    "thus , unlike for the loudon - fleury terms , for triple resonance the difference between the mean - field and the renormalized forms of the quasiparticle spectrum does not yield qualitatively different answers for the singularities .",
    "for this reason , we will keep working with the mean - field form of @xmath100 . in the next subsection",
    "we will find that triple resonance does indeed yield the strongest divergence of the raman scattering cross - section .    finally , in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ intraband](b ) , we have a product of @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and their half - sum in the denominator .",

    ". they may formally be even more singular than the ones above .",
    "however , just as in the nonresonant section , we can omit them if we assume the large-@xmath108 limit , which was implicit in the considerations just outlined .      in this subsection",

    "in that case the energy scale of the phonons is quite small compared to the bandwidth in semiconductors .",
    "therefore an expansion of electronic band structure to quadratic order near the minima is _ a priori _ warranted , and the resulting integrals are often doable analytically.@xcite    in our case , however , the wavevectors of the magnons contributing to the two - magnon peak are of the same order as the brillouin zone itself , and their energy is comparable to the fermionic bandwidth .",
    "thus , we are forced to deal with a full spin density wave band structure without necessarily being able to expand it near some point .",
    "this complicates the integration considerably , although we will eventually find that some analytical results are still possible .",

    "we now discuss in more detail how these ( and other ) results are related to experiment .",
    "we first summarize the main results of our work .",
    "we developed a general diagrammatic approach to raman scattering in antiferromagnetic insulators . for photon frequencies small",
    "compared to the gap between conduction and valence band , we rederived diagrammatically the loudon - fleury hamiltonian,@xcite which had been first derived from the hubbard model by shastry and shraiman@xcite in a different formalism .",
    "we also considered the location and shape of the two - magnon peak by studying the magnon - magnon scattering in a systematic @xmath136 expansion .",
    "the results of this study are consistent with the earlier considerations by canali and girvin.@xcite    we studied for the first time the two - magnon raman scattering in the so - called resonant regime when the incident and final photon frequencies are only @xmath359 apart from the hubbard gap . in this situation ,",
    "the diagrams which are subleading in the nonresonant region become dominant .",
    "we identified the diagram which gave a dominant contribution to the raman vertex in the resonant regime , and found the region in the @xmath360 plane where the raman vertex is divergent , unless one includes into consideration the damping of quasiparticles .",
    "the divergence is due to the simultaneous vanishing of all three denominators in the expression for the raman matrix element .",
    "this phenomenon is called triple resonance . in the presence of a moderate quasiparticle damping , the divergence in the raman vertex",
    "is gone , but the enhancement due to the triple resonance can indeed survive .",
    "based on the experimental data , we then assumed that the location of the two - magnon peak in the resonant regime remains practically in the same place as at small photon frequencies , i.e. , at @xmath361 . for nearly all incoming photon frequencies",
    "@xmath1 falling within the hubbard bands ( i.e. , corresponding to the features in the optical absorption spectrum ) , this magnon frequency is located below the region where our calculations show a triple resonance is allowed ( see fig .",
    "( [ solution ] ) ) . based on these facts",
    ", we formulated an `` effective '' loudon - fleury - like theory in which the position and shape of the raman profile in the two - magnon peak area of @xmath362 ( but not at higher magnon frequencies ) is solely due to the final state magnon - magnon interactions , while the triple resonance in the raman vertex at larger @xmath363 leads to the `` shoulder - like '' behavior in the magnon profile .",
    "when the incident photon frequency approaches @xmath364 , which corresponds to the particle and the hole being excited to nearly the tops of their respective bands , the triple resonance region allowed at a given @xmath1 shifts down to lower transferred frequencies , and finally intersects the value of @xmath24 where the two - magnon peak is located .",
    "we found that this happens when @xmath365 is very close to the top of the quasiparticle band , @xmath366 .",
    "right at the crossing point , the intensity of the two - magnon peak amplitude diverges ( in the absence of quasiparticle damping ) .    as @xmath1 approaches this critical value from below , the raman intensity increases as @xmath367 at some distance away from the resonance , and as @xmath368 in the immediate vicinity of the resonance .",

    "we therefore do not expect to see cubic dependence , but inverse linear increase of @xmath322 should be observable .",
    "we now analyze how these results are related to the experimental measurements in fig .",
    "[ twom ] and fig .",
    "[ peak ] . in the introduction we listed the key experimental features that required explanation . here",
    "we list them again and comment on each of them .    in fig .",
    "[ twom ] :    \\(a ) _ asymmetry of the two - magnon peak profile _ :",
    "our theory predicts that for @xmath24 smaller than @xmath369 the two - magnon peak profile should be asymmetric with a `` shoulder - like '' behavior at frequencies close to @xmath324 , due to the triple resonance in the raman vertex .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "in particular , the experimentally measured two - magnon profile in @xmath370 was analyzed  @xcite and found to contain two peaks , a two - magnon peak at @xmath4 , and a smaller one at @xmath371 , which is precisely as expected from our calculations .",
    "notice , however , that the calculation of the relative intensity of the peaks is beyond the scope of the present approach .",
    "\\(b ) _ selection rules _ : the leading diagram in the resonance regime contributes to scattering in both @xmath18 and @xmath17 geometries .",
    "the signals in both geometries have been observed in the experiments .",
    "recall that the loudon - fleury theory predicts scattering only in the @xmath18 geometry .",
    "\\(c ) _ stability of the two - magnon peak profile _ : away from the resonance , the stability of the two - magnon peak profile is consistent with our theory , as the enhancement of the raman vertex for @xmath372 occurs near @xmath324 .",
    "as @xmath1 approaches @xmath369 , the situation becomes more complex , as one can not separately consider the peak due to magnon - magnon interaction and the enhancement of the raman vertex due to the triple resonance .",
    "the experimental data seem to indicate that the two - magnon peak profile changes little as @xmath1 sweeps through the resonance .",
    "this is not entirely consistent with our scenario , as the triple resonance region shifts to lower magnon energies @xmath24 as the photon frequency @xmath1 approaches @xmath369 .",
    "however , the magnon profile itself in the resonant region can only be obtained by solving coupled equations for the enhancements due to the triple resonance and the final state magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "we have not yet been able to accomplish that , and we leave it for future work . we regard this as the most important unresolved issue of all that remain .",
    "notice also that the observed distortion of the raman profile at higher photon frequencies is qualitatively consistent with our main conclusion that once the photon frequency passes the top of the coherent quasiparticle band , one must consider a qualitatively different set of electronic states .",
    "our speculation at present is that at such frequences the dominant contribution to raman scattering comes from an incoherent , diffusive hole motion , which can more easily couple to multi - magnon excitations .    in fig .",
    "[ peak ] :    \\(a ) _ a single peak _ : our theory predicts a _ single _ maximum in the two - magnon peak intensity measured as a function of the incident photon frequency . on the contrary , on the basis of general considerations in raman scattering,@xcite we might have expected two peaks , one at @xmath373 , and the other at @xmath374 .",
    "these are the so - called incoming and outgoing resonances . in the more traditional area of phonon raman scattering in semiconductors,@xcite",
    "the two peaks are not always separately resolved .",
    "however , given the large magnon energy scale in the cuprates , we might have expected them to be resolvable .",
    "an additional bit of evidence that triple resonance is a plausible explanation is that , experimentally , the two - magnon peak is seen in the interval of incoming photon frequencies about @xmath371 in width , which for @xmath375 is of the same width as the interval @xmath376 in our theory , where the triple resonance is possible for all directions of the magnon momenta @xmath118 .",
    "\\(b ) _ peak location _ : our theory predicts the maximum of the two - magnon peak intensity , measured as a function of @xmath1 , right near the upper edge of the quasiparticle fermionic band .",
    "at the same time , the coherent quasiparticle contribution to the optical conductivity @xmath90 was shown to have most of its weight located near the lower band edge and vanish at the upper band edge ( as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ newfig](b ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fig .",
    "[ peak ] which shows that raman scattering is strongest right at the upper end of those features in the optical data that can be interpreted as particle - hole excitations between the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the location of the raman maximum versus the features in @xmath90 has been one of the greatest experimental puzzles in this area , and its solution in our approach serves as a partial verification of the sdw dispersion relation for the carriers which , despite much theoretical work , has not been well - established experimentally in these materials .    in fig .",
    "[ fit ] we fit the published experimental data  @xcite from fig .",
    "[ peak ] on the peak intensity in @xmath377 at room temperature by our eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) .",
    "we see that a fit to the predicted inverse linear dependence is reasonably good .",
    "the inverse linear dependence starts from @xmath378 and extends nearly up to the resonance frequency @xmath379 .",
    "the effects of fermionic damping are probably relevant only in the immediate vicinity of the resonance .",
    "note that the resonance value obtained from the fit is larger than the peak location at @xmath380 in fig  [ peak ] .",
    "in fact , the experimental data at high frequencies have been reexamined in recent studies  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the resonance at room temperature occurs at a higher frequency than has been previously believed , and in particular the the intensity at @xmath381 is found to be _ larger _ than at @xmath382 , unlike what one sees in fig .",
    "the new data suggest the resonance frequency value may exceed @xmath16 , which would make it even more consistent with the fit to the theoretical dependence .",
    "these recent experiments  @xcite also measured the peak intensity in @xmath383 at low temperatures ( @xmath384 ) .",
    "we fitted the new data by the same inverse linear dependence and found even better agreement with the experimental data for @xmath1 between @xmath385 and @xmath16 .",
    "this fit yields about the same resonance frequency @xmath386 as the fit at room temperatures .",
    "we actually do not expect that the resonance values at room temperatures and at @xmath387 are the same , but we notice that the optical studies in @xmath198 have shown@xcite that the optical absorption peak shifts to higher frequencies by less than @xmath388 between room temperatures and @xmath389 , and one can expect the peak in raman intensity to shift by about the same amount .",
    "this small shift is indeed within the combined accuracy of our theory and the data available for the fits .",
    "notice that our theory also predicts that the raman intensity should have an additional , smaller , peak at @xmath390 due to the loudon - fleury mechanism .",
    "there is no evidence for the peak at @xmath373 in the room temperature data on fig  [ peak ] .",
    "preliminary results of recent low - temperature experiments  @xcite indicate a possibility that there is in fact a second , smaller peak at @xmath391  which is consistent with our prediction .",
    "there are , however , several experimental results which are beyond the scope of our approach .",
    "first is the width of the two - magnon peak , which exceeds the prediction of the spin - wave theory even if we take into account the resonance in the raman vertex . as we already remarked above , simply invoking quantum fluctuations for spin-@xmath392",
    "is unlikely to improve the spin - wave theory , since direct numerical calculations of the raman spectrum on finite clusters also predict a narrow peak in this case.@xcite another experimental fact is the existence of a considerable raman signal @xmath327 above the maximum possible two - magnon energy ( i.e. , above @xmath393 ) .",
    "canali and girvin@xcite performed a very detailed study of the effects of four - magnon scattering within the context of the heisenberg model for spins and the loudon - fleury coupling of spins to light .",
    "they found that this scattering can give rise to the raman cross - section above @xmath393 , but the intensity of the raman signal was found to be too small to fully account for the experimental data .",
    "thus one apparently has to go beyond the minimal model .    in the approach put forward by singh,@xcite further neighbor terms in the effective hamiltonian for coupling of light to spins are postulated , and the coefficients adjusted so that the moments of the raman spectrum evaluated by the series expansion agree with observations .",
    "such next - nearest - neighbor terms broaden the two - magnon peak and also automatically break the selection rule for the loudon - fleury hamiltonian which disallows scattering in the @xmath17 configuration .",
    "of course , a question then arises of the origin of such terms and their relative strength .",
    "notice that the further - neighbor terms are in fact also effectively present in our momentum - space description , as it clearly follows from the shraiman - shastry formulation of the problem in which the non - loudon - fleury terms in the raman vertex correspond to the effective spin interactions between further neighbors .    in the bulk of the paper we `` factorized '' the problem by setting the raman vertex to its loudon - fleury form in the calculations of two - magnon profile right near the peak .",
    "this , however , is only an approximation , and in view of singh s results , we can expect some broadening of the two - magnon peak in the more sophisticated calculations along our lines , which would treat the resonance and the final state interactions together . simultaneously , we might also expect a shift of the two - magnon peak position from @xmath203 . in the bulk of the paper we used @xmath203 because of the agreement with neutron experiments .",
    "we note however , that the only observations to date of the two - magnon peak in cuprates were made at or near the resonant frequencies , which are in the visible light region in cuprates . in that sense",
    ", we may not even know what the `` true '' , i.e. , nonresonant peak shape and location are .",
    "the scattering in @xmath18 and @xmath17 geometries in the sdw technique has been studied by kampf and brenig.@xcite they , however , focused on high _ transferred _ frequencies , comparable to the mott - hubbard gap , and did not include collective spin fluctuation modes ( i.e. , magnons ) in their theory .",
    "in view of this , a comparison of our results with theirs is not possible .    in a rather different spirit",
    ", it was observed in a paper by weber and ford@xcite that even a rather small magnon damping introduced phenomenologically into the equations broaden s the parkinson peak considerably .",
    "more recently , merlin@xcite argued that phonons may be the source of that damping .",
    "should the electron - phonon interaction prove relevant to the problem , this will only lend credence of the key phenomenological assumption of this work , namely that on a `` first pass '' at the resonant scattering problem , it is best not to try to deal simultaneously with two quite possibly distinct issues of the two - magnon peak shape and its strength variation with the incoming photon frequency .    finally , an experimental fact which needs answering is the existence of the raman signal at _ very _ high incident and transferred frequencies , of the order of @xmath394 and @xmath395 , respectively .",
    "the largest intensity at such high frequencies was obtained in the `` chiral '' @xmath396 channel .",
    "khveshchenko and wiegmann recently performed an elegant study of the contribution to raman vertex in this frequency range from chiral spin fluctuations in the magnetically ordered phase.@xcite for our considerations , it is essential that at such high frequencies , the incoming photon is above the coherent quasiparticle band ( where our theory applies ) and the motion of the carriers that subsequently couple to the magnons is itself incoherent in character",
