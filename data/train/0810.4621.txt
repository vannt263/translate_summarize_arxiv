    "mergers seem to have played a major role in determining the shapes and dynamics of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a few galactic mergers still occur and offer valuable clues to past evolutionary processes .",
    "young globular clusters formed during mergers hold strong promise for age - dating such events , besides helping shed light on the cluster - formation process itself .",
    "globular clusters are very useful probes of the dynamical and chemical assembly history of galaxies .",
    "many globular cluster ( gc ) systems in normal giant elliptical galaxies show a bimodal color distribution , indicating the occurrence of a second event / mechanism of cluster formation .",
    "the `` merger '' model suggests that metal - rich ( `` red '' ) clusters are formed during major mergers of gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "globular cluster systems in young merger remnants such as ngc 7252 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveal a bimodal color distribution featuring not only the well - known `` universal '' halo population of old metal - poor gcs , but also hundreds of second - generation gcs that are young , metal - rich , and have most probably formed from the metal - enriched gas associated with the progenitor spirals .",
    "the many structural properties that merger remnants such as ngc 1275 , ngc 3921 , and ngc 7252 share with normal ellipticals suggest not only that these merger remnants are proto - ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also that many normal ellipticals with bimodal color distributions may have formed their metal - rich gcs in a similar manner .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it should be possible to find ellipticals with second - generation gc systems of intermediate age ( @xmath2 14 gyr ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of intermediate - age gcs in ellipticals has been recently found for a few galaxies like ngc 1316 @xcite , ngc 3610 @xcite , ngc 1700 @xcite , ngc 4365 @xcite , and ngc 5128 @xcite .",
    "this paper aims at searching for intermediate - age clusters in a sample of early - type galaxies which show evidence for having experienced a merger and a starburst in the recent past ( during which gcs may well have formed ) . to select the sample",
    ", we used the @xcite catalog .",
    "this catalog consists of southern elliptical galaxies that feature shells and/or ripples around their main body and in their outer envelopes .",
    "shells are a common result of galaxy mergers @xcite or interactions @xcite and are expected to have a lifetime of only @xmath4 years .",
    "approximately 10% of these early - type shell galaxies have colors , absolute magnitudes , and spectra characteristic of `` poststarburst '' galaxies ( featuring strong balmer lines * ? ? ?",
    "a poststarburst spectrum is characterized by the presence of strong balmer absorption lines ( indicative of a - type stars ) , but without strong [ oii ] or h@xmath5 emission lines @xcite .",
    "the existence of strong balmer absorption lines indicates that these galaxies have experienced star formation in the past @xmath2 0.1  1 gyr while the absence of emission lines indicates they are no longer forming stars .",
    "most such galaxies are classified as poststarburst based on the nature of the spectrum only in their central region .",
    "often no information is available on the extent of the poststarburst event or the amount of _ global _ star formation .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the global properties of the poststarburst class of galaxies and explore the connection ( if any ) between properties of the host galaxy and its star formation history .",
    "we will address these issues through a study of the gc systems of these galaxies since they provide a good handle on the impact of major star formation episodes in a galaxy .",
    "if numerous intermediate - age gcs with ages consistent with those of the poststarburst population in the nucleus were to be found , we could be fairly confident that the a stars were formed in a relatively vigorous star formation event , likely associated with a recent dissipative galaxy merger .",
    "conversely , an absence of such gcs would indicate that no strong star formation was associated with the event that caused star formation to end @xmath20.1 to 1 gyr ago .",
    "the latter would be consistent with a scenario where gas is removed from the galaxy , e.g.  by weak ram pressure stripping .    the nearest four galaxies from @xcite which showed a poststarburst spectrum were selected for this study .",
    "the basic properties of these galaxies are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "a detailed study of one of the galaxies , namely pgc 6240 ( am 0139@xmath6655 ) has been presented in an earlier paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the current paper presents a study of the properties of the gc systems as well as the diffuse light of all four early - type poststarburst galaxies .",
    "it discusses the implications of these properties in the context of the star formation history of these galaxies , and of the assembly history of early - type galaxies in general .",
    "the four galaxies were observed as part of hst general observer program 10227 ( pi : goudfrooij ) , using the wide field channel ( wfc ) of acs with the filters f475w and f814w .",
    "the observations consisted of several long exposures plus a few short ones to guarantee getting an unsaturated galaxy center .",
    "the total exposure times were 7874s , 9350s , 8369s , and 21440s in f475w and 2712s , 3970s , 5908s , and 7300s in f814w for pgc 6510 , pgc 10922 , pgc 42871 , and pgc 6240 , respectively .",
    "the data were processed with the acs on - the - fly pipeline , which included dark and bias subtraction and flat fielding .",
    "individual flat - fielded images were carefully checked for satellite trails and saturated pixels in the central region of each galaxy .",
    "these pixels were flagged and masked out .",
    "the individual images of a galaxy in each band were co - added using the pyraf task multidrizzle @xcite .",
    "this resulted in images cleaned of cosmic rays and corrected for geometric distortion .",
    "a combination of the short and long - exposure images enabled us to get good resultant multidrizzled images with unsaturated centers .",
    "the isophotal contours of the four galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ contour ] .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that the sample galaxies show significant differences in global morphology , even though they all share the properties of a poststarburst spectrum and shell structure .",
    "pgc 6510 appears to be a disky elliptical , pgc 10922 shows rounder isophotes but has a distorted center ( due to dust absorption ) , while the isophotes of both pgc 6240 and pgc 42871 appear irregular in the outer regions .",
    "to select cluster candidates , the f475w and f814w images obtained from multidrizzle were first added together to get a high signal - to - noise _ g+i _ image for each galaxy .",
    "elliptical isophotes were then fit to this coadded image using the task ellipse within stsdas , and allowing the center , ellipticity , and position angle of the isophotes to vary .",
    "this yielded a smooth model of each galaxy s count distribution .",
    "the search for sources was performed on an image created by dividing the _ g+i _ image by the square root of the model image .",
    "this ensures uniform shot noise characteristics over the whole image .",
    "the detection threshold for selecting sources was set at 4@xmath7 above the background .",
    "typical half - light radii of globular clusters fall into the range 1  20 pc @xcite . at the distance of our sample galaxies ,",
    "the spatial scale is 1425 pc per acs@xmath8wfc pixel .",
    "thus , we expect the globular clusters to appear as nearly unresolved point sources .",
    "there are two advantages in using the _ g+i _ images , rather than the individual @xmath9- or @xmath10-band images , for cluster - candidate selection .",
    "firstly , the coadded images reach a greater depth than the individual images , and secondly , the photometric zero - point of a _ g+i _ image is significantly less color dependent than that of the individual images .",
    "a detailed illustration and discussion of these advantages can be found in @xcite .    to perform cluster photometry ,",
    "a smooth elliptical model was constructed for each galaxy in each filter in a manner similar to the one described above .",
    "this model was subtracted from the corresponding drizzled image to get a residual image .",
    "the cluster candidates are clearly visible once the underlying galaxy light has been subtracted .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed through an aperture of 3 pixel radius for all the detected sources .",
    "the photometry lists thus obtained for both filters were then matched for further analysis .",
    "aperture corrections from 3 pixel to 10 pixel radius were determined using a few bright point sources in each band .",
    "the corrections from 10 pixel radius to infinity were taken from @xcite .",
    "finally , the f475w and f814w magnitudes were converted from the instrumental system ( stmag ) to sdss _",
    "g _ and cousins _",
    "i _ magnitudes in the vega system via the synphot package in stsdas ; for details , see paper i. the _ g _ and _ i _ magnitudes and the @xmath11 color were corrected for milky way foreground reddening using @xmath12 given in table  [ tbl-1 ] and the relations @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    after discarding clusters with photometric errors @xmath150.4 mag in each band , the first selection criterion we applied considered the target s color index @xmath11 . using the population - synthesis models galev of @xcite",
    ", we determined that the range @xmath16 includes all model clusters with ages from @xmath17 to @xmath18 years and metallicities @xmath19 from 0.0004 to 0.05 ( where @xmath20 corresponds to solar metallicity ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the galev models are calibrated to the acs filters and were hence chosen to avoid introducing systematic errors while converting to a standard system . however , the differences between model predictions of galev and ( e.g. ) @xcite in the age range 0.514 gyr stay within 0.05 mag in @xmath21 .",
    "we also verified that the results obtained using the @xcite models are consistent with those from galev as shown in fig .",
    "2 . an extensive comparison between the various simple stellar population ( ssp ) models can be found in @xcite .",
    "sources with colors outside the range @xmath16 were judged unlikely to be real star clusters and were discarded .",
    "the resultant source list contains cluster candidates , stars , and background galaxies .",
    "to further constrain the selection and discard extended background galaxies , we determined the fwhm of all objects in the color - selected lists from the coadded image , using the iraf task imexam , and retained objects with @xmath22 fwhm @xmath23 pixels .",
    "an additional compactness criterion was applied to only retain sources that had a difference in magnitudes between apertures of 2 and 5 pixel radius of 0.2 to 0.6 mag .",
    "our final list of gc candidates contains the sources that satisfy all the above criteria .",
    "completeness tests were done for each galaxy on the image used to detect cluster candidates ( i.e. , the _ g+i _ image ) .",
    "artificial clusters were added to the image in batches of 100 for five different background levels and in 0.25 mag intervals . using the background levels in the parts of the image farthest away from , and nearest to , the galaxy center where clusters are still detected as the two extremes , the five background levels were determined by dividing this interval into five logarithmically equal intervals .",
    "the radial - intensity profile of the artificial clusters was determined by fitting psfs to the real clusters in the _ g+i _ image .",
    "a smooth elliptical model of each host galaxy was obtained , and the _ g+i _ image was divided by the square root of this model image .",
    "source detection was then performed on this image in the same manner as done previously for the actual sources .",
    "other criteria ( permissible error in photometric magnitude , fwhm , and compactness ) were also applied in exactly the same manner as before . a typical sample of completeness curves , obtained for pgc 6510 is shown in fig .  [ ccurves ] .",
    "to determine the radial extent of the cluster candidates that are physically associated with the target galaxy versus compact background galaxies that have similar colors and apparent magnitudes , we examined the surface number density of the gc candidates as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "this was achieved by dividing each galaxy image into annular rings centered on the galaxy center and computing the number of sources per unit area in each ring .",
    "the bright background due to the presence of the galaxy would prevent the detection of faint sources in the inner regions , while sources of the same magnitude would be easily detected in the outer regions of low background . to account for this effect , we applied a magnitude cut - off to the sources that were considered for the surface density measurements .",
    "this cut - off was chosen to be at the magnitude associated with a completeness value of 80% at a galactocentric radius of 6 . only sources outside that radius were taken into account .",
    "figure  [ magdensity ] shows the results .",
    "we find that the surface - density profile flattens off beyond a certain radius for each galaxy .",
    "this radius was taken to be the limiting radius for the sources associated with that galaxy and was found to be 60 , 94 , 104 , and 78  for pgc 6510 , pgc 10922 , pgc 42871 , and pgc 6240 , respectively .",
    "all sources detected beyond this radius were considered background sources .",
    "the radial gc surface - number - density profiles are in most cases similar to the surface brightness profile of the parent galaxies , which is consistent with the situation for the metal - rich subpopulation of gcs in normal early - type galaxies @xcite . however , the gcs in pgc 10922 seem to have a more extended distribution , similar to that seen for metal - poor gcs in normal early - type galaxies .",
    "quantitatively , simple power - law fits to the outer data points yield exponents ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , whereas surface - number - density profiles for gcs in normal elliptical galaxies show power - law exponents in the range between @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is also seen that in all cases , the innermost gc bin has a lower surface number density than that represented by the power - law fits .",
    "this could be due to the faster destruction of gcs in the inner regions of these galaxies due to effects such as bulge shocking ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] gives the limiting magnitude , power - law exponent , and radial range considered for the fit in each case .",
    "a list of the thirty brightest clusters in the @xmath10-band in pgc 6510 , pgc 10922 , and pgc 42871 ( with their positions , @xmath10-band magnitudes and distance from the galaxy center ) is given in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "paper i already contains a list of the brightest clusters in pgc 6240 and it is not repeated here .",
    "color  magnitude diagrams for the clusters associated with each galaxy within the limiting galactocentric radius as found in the previous section are shown for equal areas of increasing galactocentric distance in fig .  [ cmd ] .",
    "note that the magnitudes and colors have been corrected for foreground reddening as described in sect .",
    "3 . for comparison",
    ", we indicate the area which would be populated by old metal - poor gcs similar to those in the halo of our galaxy , scaled to the distance of each galaxy .",
    "typically a large number of gcs with @xmath28 to 1.5 is seen in each galaxy .",
    "this color index is similar to , though slightly larger than , the mean index expected for a population of old metal - poor gcs like those in the halo of our galaxy ( e.g. , a mean age of 14 gyr and a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath61.5 ) .",
    "note , however , that this color is also consistent with solar - metallicity clusters of age @xmath21 gyr as indicated by ssp synthesis models ( cf .",
    "[ ssp ] ) , the presence of which might be expected in a poststarburst galaxy .",
    "intermediate - age gcs in established merger remnants feature a radial surface number density distribution that is significantly more centrally concentrated than that of old metal - poor gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an attempt to discriminate between the two plausible interpretations of the nature of the gcs with @xmath28 , we therefore divide up the clusters into four equal - area bins of increasing galactocentric radii ( see different symbols in fig .  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "all color distributions appear broader than the halo gc distributions in our galaxy as outlined by the rectangles .",
    "the innermost gcs in most of the galaxies have mean colors that are somewhat redder ( @xmath29 ) than those of old metal - poor gcs . while this could in principle",
    "be a result of reddening by dust in the inner regions that shifts the clusters to fainter magnitudes and redder colors , there are very few clusters found in the inner dusty regions .",
    "alternatively , it could indicate the presence of a second - generation population of clusters with ages slightly larger than 1.0 gyr .",
    "a comparison of the dimming vector for a 1.0 gyr old population aging to 1.6 gyr ( shown in fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) with the distribution of the inner clusters in the cmd does suggest the possibility of these clusters being slightly older than 1.0 gyr .",
    "apart from that , there is also a population of ( inner ) clusters with colors significantly bluer than old metal - poor gcs in pgc 6240 .",
    "thus , it appears likely that the gc systems of these poststarburst galaxies are made up of more than a single - age population .",
    "the question of how to disentangle the different populations in a quantitative way will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "the color distribution of the gcs was analyzed by first computing the non - parametric epanechnikov - kernel probability - density function @xcite of all objects within the limiting radius .",
    "the probability - density function of all objects outside this radius was then computed similarly to provide an estimate of the contamination by compact background galaxies .",
    "finally , the background density estimate was scaled to that of the cluster candidates by area , and the true color distribution of the gcs was derived by statistical subtraction .",
    "figure  [ color ] shows the color distributions of the sources within the limiting radius , the background sources , and the inner sources after statistical background subtraction .",
    "the final color distribution appears mostly unimodal in pgc 6510 , while that of pgc 42871 shows the possible presence of a second , bluer population similar to that found earlier for pgc 6240 @xcite .",
    "according to the ssp models of @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ ssp ] , these can be explained by a metal - rich population with ages of a few hundred myr . in case of pgc 10922",
    ", the color distribution shows some indications of clusters with colors @xmath30 1.0 and @xmath30 0.0 .",
    "however , as they are very few in number , it is difficult to draw any conclusions about them .",
    "it is also interesting to note that we do not detect any significant population of old , metal - rich ( @xmath31 } \\la 0.0 $ ] ) gcs in any of the sample galaxies ( they should show up at @xmath32 ) , whereas such a population _ is _ generally present in normal early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ s : hostconnection ] .",
    "to derive cluster luminosity functions ( lfs ) , we used the completeness curves described in sect .  3 to assign a completeness value to each cluster .",
    "this value was computed via bilinear interpolation in cluster magnitude and background value .",
    "clusters with completeness values less than @xmath33 were excluded from being counted .",
    "the remaining clusters were divided into two groups based on their distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "clusters within the limiting radius ( determined in sect .",
    "3 ) were designated as actual gc candidates and those outside this radius as likely background contaminants .",
    "the lfs of the gc candidates were then corrected for background contamination using the scaled lfs of the background .",
    "the final corrected lfs are shown in fig .",
    "[ lf ] .",
    "if the lfs were made up entirely of clusters belonging to an old metal - poor population similar to that found in our galaxy , and hence had a gaussian form with a turn - over at @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite , we would not expect to see any clusters brighter than @xmath36 . however , except for pgc 10922 , the galaxies in our sample show clusters significantly brighter than this value . while the gc color distribution alone may show no obvious indication of the presence of more than one subpopulation",
    ", the fact that overluminous gcs are seen in the lf which are unlikely to belong to an old population suggests that the observed lf is due to the superposition of an old population and a younger population with mean colors that are similar to one another .",
    "for example , the lf of pgc 42871 shows an excess of luminous clusters at magnitudes brighter than @xmath37 .",
    "inspection of the cmd ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) shows that these luminous clusters predominantly have @xmath3  colors redder than 1.5 mag and , hence , are not associated with the bluer peak seen in fig .",
    "[ color ] .",
    "ssp models show that between the ages of 1 and 2 gyr , the colors of metal - rich clusters of solar metallicity are indistinguishable from those of typical old metal - poor clusters . however , these intermediate - age clusters are brighter than the old clusters by @xmath21.5 mag for a given mass @xcite . using the ssp models of @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ ssp ] , we find that the colors of these luminous clusters are consistent with them being intermediate - age clusters ( 11.5 gyr ) of solar metallicity .    our assumption of solar metallicity for these second - generation gcs is based on ( a ) the expectation of finding high metallicity gcs formed from gas in evolved spirals which are the likely precursor galaxies , and ( b ) the finding that intermediate - age gcs in other merger remnants have metallicities consistent with solar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the above example shows , the color distribution of clusters in poststarburst galaxies of age @xmath20.52 gyr is not expected to show the signature of two subpopulations prominently because the younger , metal - rich population will have a mean color similar to that of the old metal - poor population . in that case , one way to test for the presence of multiple populations and estimate their properties is to study the lf . in paper",
    "i , we attempted to model the cluster lf of pgc 6240 as a combination of an old metal - poor population and an intermediate - age population .",
    "the old population was estimated by fitting template gaussian lf components .",
    "these were then subtracted from the observed lf , and the residual lf was used to estimate the contribution of the intermediate - age population by means of least - squares fits .",
    "here we use the same method to investigate the lfs of clusters in pgc 6510 , pgc 10922 , and pgc 42871 and to explore the possibility of multiple cluster populations of different ages but similar color . for pgc 10922 and pgc 42871 , we consider only clusters with @xmath3  @xmath38 to avoid contamination by clusters associated with the bluer peak seen in the color distribution .",
    "we estimate the contributions of the old metal - poor gcs and the intermediate - age gcs in the following manner .",
    "first , we compute the total @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes and @xmath3  of the galaxies using the ellipse fitting task and elapert within stsdas .",
    "pgc 42871 and pgc 6240 do not show evidence for their integrated colors being significantly reddened by dust .",
    "however , pgc 6510 has redder colors and the color - index map ( fig .",
    "[ colmap ] ) also shows strong evidence for patchy dust distributed asymmetrically around the central region . since",
    "the dust distribution is asymmetric about the central region , we use the unreddened regions to compute the reddening in the dusty regions and correct the total magnitudes and color of pgc 6510 .",
    "the corrected values are given in table  [ tbl-4 ] . to estimate the gaussian lfs associated with the old metal - poor gc population , we need to apply luminosity fading to the galaxies light .",
    "treating the diffuse light of the galaxies as ssps , we estimate the luminosity - weighted age for a solar - metallicity population from the total integrated @xmath3  color index of each galaxy and look up the expected fading in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands when the galaxy ages to 14 gyr using the galev ssp models ( see table  [ tbl-4 ] ) . a comparison with the maraston models is also shown in the table .",
    "the following calculations are done using values from the galev models .    using the galaxy s faded @xmath41 value in the equation for the specific frequency : @xmath42 ( i.e. , the number of star clusters per galaxy luminosity normalized to an absolute _ v _ magnitude of @xmath615 @xcite ) , we calculate the number of old gcs expected for four typical values of @xmath43 = 3.0 , 1.0 , 0.5 , 0.25 .",
    "the specific frequency is known to increase systematically along the hubble sequence , from 0.5 @xmath44 0.2 for sc spirals to 2.6 @xmath44 0.5 for ellipticals outside of clusters @xcite .",

    "figure  [ composite ] illustrates that the observed luminosity functions can be well modeled as composites of an old metal - poor population , as is normally seen in early - type galaxies , and an intermediate - age population that is more metal - rich .",
    "however , note that the relative contributions of these two populations to the total lf vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy : the clusters in pgc 6510 seem to be predominantly intermediate - age metal - rich ones , whereas almost all clusters in pgc 10922 can be attributed to an old metal - poor population .",

    "in this section we discuss the properties of the cluster systems in the four early - type poststarburst galaxies of our sample in terms of implications related to the assembly of their host galaxies .",

    "this indicates that the progenitor galaxies lacked any significant number of old , metal - rich gcs typically seen in normal early - type galaxies .",
    "this in turn seems to point to late - type spirals as being the progenitors of these poststarburst early - type shell galaxies since old , metal - rich clusters are typically associated with spheroidal components of galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the progenitors of these poststarburst galaxies were ellipticals as also indicated by the presence of shells and other sharp features indicative of former disks .",

    "a comparison of the gcs of present - day ellipticals with those of our sample galaxies can shed light on this .",
    "for any such comparison , we need to take into account the changes in the gc systems of our sample galaxies as they evolve to older ages . one important such change is due to cluster disruption .",
    "star clusters are vulnerable to disruption by a variety of processes operating on different time scales . since the intermediate - age clusters in our sample are @xmath2 1 gyr old , processes such as two - body relaxation , tidal disruption , and dynamical friction all play important roles in removing stars from the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the mass function of `` old '' gcs is known to have a turnover at @xmath50 . the number of intermediate - age clusters with masses greater than this value is not expected to be affected by disruption to within 10% @xcite .",
    "these relatively massive clusters are thus assumed to survive and become `` old '' metal - rich red gcs as the galaxy ages .",

    "overlapping color around @xmath62 , we fit the observed gclfs as composites of a gaussian ( as seen in `` old '' gc systems ) and a power law ( seen in young and intermediate - age gc systems ) . by scaling the gaussian component using plausible values of the specific frequencies ( @xmath43 values ) of old metal - poor gcs seen in present - day normal galaxies , we find the following : 1 .",
    "we deduce the presence of a substantial population of intermediate - age gcs in three out of four galaxies in our sample .",
    "these gcs have ages between 11.5 gyr which is comparable to typical lifetimes of the shells , providing evidence that these gcs likely formed during the same merger event that formed the shells",
    "the integrated colors of pgc 6240 and pgc 42871 are consistent with those of the intermediate - age gcs , suggesting that the bulk of the field stars were formed in the same star formation event that formed the intermediate - age gcs . interpreting the integrated light of pgc 6240 and pgc 42871 as a single - age stellar population of solar metallicity , the ratio of the numbers of metal - poor to metal - rich gcs are consistent with those of present - day ( giant ) early - type galaxies if the @xmath43 values of the merger progenitor galaxies were in the range @xmath52 .",

    "<S> the color distribution of the globular clusters in all four galaxies shows a broad peak centered on @xmath0 , while pgc 6240 and pgc 42871 show a significant number of globular clusters with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter globular clusters are interpreted as being of age @xmath2500 myr and likely having been formed in the merger . </S>",
    "<S> the color of the redder peak is consistent with that expected for an old metal - poor population that is very commonly found around normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , all galaxies except pgc 10922 contain several globular clusters that are significantly brighter than the maximum luminosity expected of a single old metal - poor population . to test for multiple - age populations of overlapping @xmath3color </S>",
    "<S> , we model the luminosity functions of the globular clusters as composites of an old metal - poor subpopulation with a range of plausible specific frequencies and an intermediate - age subpopulation of solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that three of the four sample galaxies show evidence for the presence of an intermediate - age ( @xmath21 gyr ) globular cluster population , in addition to the old metal - poor gc population seen in normal early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> none of the galaxies show a significant population of clusters consistent with an old , metal - rich red cluster population that is typically seen in early - type galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a substantial number of intermediate - age clusters and the absence of old , metal - rich clusters indicate that the progenitor galaxies which formed the resulting shell galaxy were gas rich and did not host significant bulges . </S>",
    "<S> late - type spirals seem to be the most plausible progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> these results lend credence to the `` merger scenario '' in which the red , metal - rich gcs observed in normal ellipticals are formed during a dissipative merger event that also forms the elliptical itself . </S>"
