    "star formation is accompanied by the ejection of mass from protostellar sources , which is often seen in the form of collimated outflows . where the overlying extinction is low enough to permit optical observations , structures called herbig - haro ( hh ) objects",
    "have been observed towards such outflows , mainly ( but not exclusively ) from protostars with @xmath0 .",
    "hh objects are regions of shocked gas and dust that show the locations of impact between protostellar outflows and their surrounding environments .",
    "these powerful outflows are usually in the form of jets and the hh objects are sometimes observed as isolated entities and sometimes as a collimated chain of knots along the jets .",
    "the emission - line properties of hh objects imply that the gas is excited by shock waves @xcite , and the characteristic low - excitation emission lines in the optical spectral range set them apart from the well known h regions associated with high - mass protosteller objects .",
    "observations of hh objects show that many of these outflows are interacting with dense molecular material and have been found to be accompanied by strong , near - infrared ( nir ) lines from the h@xmath1 molecule , at 2.12 @xmath2 m .",
    "it is widely recognised that the nir emission lines of the h@xmath1 molecule at 2.12 @xmath2 m are collisionally excited in slow , non - dissociative shocks and are one of the primary signatures of c - type shocks in dense molecular material ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "hh objects are sometimes seen as bow - shaped structures that show signatures of j - type shocks ( discontinuous , dissociative shocks ) at the apex and c - type shocks ( continuous , non - dissociative shocks ) in the wings of the bow .",
    "for example , @xcite used modelling of hh7 to successfully explain their nir observations of the 2.12 @xmath2 m , h@xmath1 line emission in terms of a c - type shock on the wings of a bow - shaped structure .    in recent years weak masers from one of the ground - state lines ( at 1720 mhz ) of the oh molecule have been found to be associated with a sample of supernova remnants ( snr ; e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "these masers are believed to be collisionally excited behind the shock front where the ejected material from a supernova explosion rams into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the inferred interactions have been confirmed by follow - up searches for millimetre or ir emission from hot molecular gas or from molecules produced by the rich chemistry occurring within the shock front ( e.g.  @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . to date , 1720-mhz oh masers have been found in about 10% of the more than 250 snrs searched ( e.g.  @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , modelled these regions and showed that under a restricted set of physical conditions , 1720-mhz oh masers can be collisionally excited behind a c - type shock formed when a snr interacts with a dense molecular cloud within the ism .",
    "nir emission from h@xmath1 at 2.12 @xmath2 m is often seen to extend over large regions of a snr , with compact maser spots located near the emission peaks .",
    "based on the tight constraints under which the masers in snrs form , @xcite suggested that the 1720-mhz oh masers could be an important signpost of c - type shocks and the interaction with dense molecular material .",
    "hh objects , like supernova remnants , also contain shocks .",
    "the shocks in hh objects occur in a wide range of physical conditions , and it is therefore possible that some of the mechanisms that operate in snrs would also operate in hh objects , and that 1720-mhz oh masers could also be excited in hh objects .",
    "however , observations to detect 1720-oh masers have rarely been undertaken towards hh objects , and there have been no blind searches of the galaxy for 1720-mhz oh masers .",
    "it is therefore possible that oh masers associated with hh objects are common but have not so far been detected .",
    "we therefore undertook a large survey of hh objects to search for oh maser emission using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , followed by very large array ( vla ) observations of the more promising of the gbt detections .",
    "generally , single - dish observations of the 1720-mhz oh masers associated with snrs show weak , narrow lines , with broad - line absorption features at 1665 and 1667 mhz .",
    "therefore , the detection of emission lines at 1720 mhz with no corresponding 1665- and 1667-mhz emission would be a strong indicator of maser emission .",
    "generally , maser emission occurs in very compact spots and has high brightness temperatures .",
    "interferometric observations are generally required to confirm these last two characteristics .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of these observations , and discuss their implications .",
    "as mentioned , only 10% of snrs searched have 1720-mhz oh masers . if a similarly small fraction of hh objects have oh masers , then a large number of sources need to be surveyed to find at least a few detections of maser emission .",
    "since shock - excited masers are not necessarily strong , a survey with high sensitivity is required . an efficient way to search a large number of sources for a particular ,",
    "weak astrophysical feature is to make the first observations with a single - dish telescope of moderate resolution and high sensitivity .",
    "for this reason our survey is composed of two parts , firstly identifying oh line emission towards hh objects by doing single - dish observations , followed by interferometric observations to confirm the presence of maser spots .",
    "this procedure was used with great success in surveys for 1720-mhz oh masers towards snrs ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we selected a sample of 97 objects from the @xmath3400 listed in reipurth s 1999 catalogue of hh objects . because the oh masers are likely to be weak , we have chosen the nearest objects , which have the best chance of being detected , from reipurth s catalogue as primary targets for our initial survey .",
    "observations using the greenbank @xmath3105  m telescope at 1720 , 1665 and 1667 mhz were made on 2005 february 05 and 07 .",
    "the quadrants of the spectral correlator were configured for the oh ground - state lines at 1720 and 1667 mhz in left and right circular polarization ( lcp and rcp ; ieee convention ) .",
    "a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz provided a resolution at 1720 mhz of 1.6 khz per channel , corresponding to a velocity coverage of more than 2000  at a velocity resolution of 0.13 .",
    "the total integration time was 15 min per source , giving a typical noise level of @xmath4 mjy .",
    "observations were done in frequency switching mode using half the integration time of 15 min per source for the nominal frequency and the other half shifted by 1 mhz .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity shift of 349  at 1720 mhz .",
    "sometimes more than one object fell within the 7  beam of the telescope so that the number of objects observed ( 97 ) exceeds the number of pointings ( 45 ) .",
    "the coordinates of the pointing centres as well as the hh objects that fell within the field - of - view for each of the observations are presented in table  [ table1 ] . for each of the observations ,",
    "the object of most interest has been chosen to be at or close to the pointing centre and those objects are listed in boldface . in this paper , we refer to specific gbt observations by the name of the object at or closest to the pointing centre , even though other objects may also be visible .",
    "the gbt spectra were converted to sdfits format at greenbank and processed further using nrao s gbtidl software .",
    "the data were folded and calibrated to janskys .",
    "linear baselines were fitted over selected spectral regions where lines occurred and subtracted from the data so that the zero - level for line profiles could be found .",
    "lcp and rcp data were analysed separately . where lines are present in the spectra , gaussian profiles were fitted by least squares , using the interactive fitgaus routine , and the parameters for the line profiles tabulated . in the case of polarised data the lcp and rcp lines were fitted separately and when no significant polarisation was seen , the lcp and rcp data were combined .",
    "the fitted gaussians were subtracted from the data , and in no case were residuals larger than expected from the noise ."
