    "significant information on the structure of the nucleon can be obtained by studying its excitation spectrum . over the last few decades , a large amount information about the spectrum of the nucleon has been collected .",
    "most of this information has been extracted from pion - induced and pion photoproduction reactions . however , pionic reactions may have biased the information on the existence of certain resonances .",
    "constituent quark model calculations predict a much richer resonance spectrum than has been observed in pion production experiments  @xcite . predicted resonances which have not been observed are called `` missing '' resonances .",
    "instead , the constituent quark model also predicts that these `` missing '' resonances may couple strongly to k@xmath1 and k@xmath2 channels or other final states involving vector mesons  @xcite . since performing kaon - hyperon ,",
    "kaon - nucleon or hyperon - nucleon scattering experiments is a daunting task , kaon photoproduction on the nucleon appears to be a good alternative solution  @xcite .",
    "experiments on kaon photoproduction and electroproduction started in the 1960s .",
    "however the old experimental data are often inconsistent and have large error bars . in recent years a large amount of data for kaon photoproduction has been collected .",
    "high statistics data from clas , for differential cross sections , recoil polarization , @xmath3 and @xmath4 double polarizations for the reaction @xmath5 have been published  @xcite .",
    "additional experimental data have also been measured by saphir  @xcite , leps  @xcite and graal  @xcite .",
    "several previous analyses have been applied to the results of these experiments , such as isobar models  @xcite and coupled channel models  @xcite .",
    "however different theoretical model calculations often produce very different predictions .    in ref.@xcite all sixteen observables in kaon photoproduction",
    "were shown to be classified into the classes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where each class is an expansion in a different set of associated legendre polynomials .",
    "what is not apparent is how many terms in each expansion are required .",
    "this work attempts to address the issue by examining data models with different numbers of terms , and calculating which one has the greatest posterior probability . in this article",
    "we only focus on the differential cross section observables , which are described by the associated legendre class @xmath10 .",
    "we construct data models based on legendre class  @xmath11 .",
    "these data models can be written compactly as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the data model , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coefficients and associated legendre polynomials .",
    "each data model therefore has a different `` order '' or maximum number of polynomials .",
    "our task is to find the most likely order .      to determine the best model",
    ", we evaluate the posterior probability  @xcite for each data model .",
    "the ratio of the probabilities for @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be written , using bayes theorem , as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the posterior for the @xmath16 model , @xmath20 is the probability that the data would be obtained , assuming @xmath16 to be true ( the likelihood ) . with no prior prejudice as to which variant is correct , we obtain the ratio of likelihoods : @xmath21 the likelihood @xmath20 is an integral over the joint likelihood @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents a set of free parameters : @xmath24 the function @xmath25 is the prior probability that the parameters take on specific values .",
    "we assume that each parameter @xmath14 lies in the range @xmath26 , and we can write the prior as the reciprocal of the volume of a hypercube in parameter search space as @xmath27 . if the errors in the data points are gaussian , it can be shown that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the sum of squared residuals . using a taylor series expansion about the minimum @xmath29 , @xmath30",
    ", we can write an approximate form for the likelihood : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the dimension of the integral and @xmath33 is the determinant of the hessian matrix , which in turn is the inverse of the covariance matrix .",
    "using the above analysis procedure , for each of the available photon energy bins , we fitted each data model to the angular distribution .",
    "this was carried out using the standard minimization package minuit .",
    "we then compared models with different numbers of legendre polynomials by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ poste ] ) for each data model .    to illustrate the procedure , we first choose one photon energy bin at @xmath34 = 1.824 gev as an example .",
    "the posterior probabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the order of the data model is shown on the horizontal axis .",
    "the maximum posterior is given by the data model containing four associated legendre polynomials .",
    "on the left side in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the fit of the fourth order data model to the clas differential cross section data  @xcite for @xmath34 = 1.824 gev .",
    "the procedure is repeated for each photon energy bin . the right side in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the order of data model which has the greatest probability at each photon energy is plotted .",
    "it can be seen that this generally increase from threshold into the resonance region , but that the maximum is mostly at the fourth order .",
    "the distributions of the polynomial coefficients for fourth order data models as a function of photon energy is shown in fig .",
    "we have analyzed the legendre polynomial decomposition of differential cross section data .",
    "we generated data models with different numbers of associated legendre polynomials .",
    "we then compared them by calculating posterior probabilities . from this analysis",
    ", we found that differential cross section data in this case requires at least four associated legendre polynomials .",
