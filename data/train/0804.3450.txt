    "there is a long history to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it began with cvc and the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , and proceeded through the ground - breaking work of gell - mann and l ' evy who invented pcac and the linear and non - linear @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "their lagrangian began from chiral symmetry in the sense that both @xmath5 and @xmath0 fields appear on an equal footing , but the symmetry between them is spontaneously broken by introducing a negative @xmath6 term .",
    "adler @xcite showed that in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems there is a zero at the unphysical point @xmath9 midway between the thresholds of @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels .",
    "` soft ' pion theory , current algebra and qcd led to the standard model . with the idea that ` bare ' quarks are almost massless , gasser and leutwyler introduced chiral perturbation theory as a systematic method of expanding amplitudes in the domain where pion masses and momenta are small @xcite .    the s - wave elastic scattering amplitude may be written @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the usual phase space factor .",
    "the numerator @xmath14 is real and describes ` driving forces ' from the left - hand cut .",
    "unitarity is accomodated by means of the @xmath15-matrix .",
    "the adler zero in the @xmath8 amplitude makes the s - wave unusual .",
    "when one projects out the s - wave from the full amplitude , there is a zero at @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude near the @xmath8 threshold rises nearly linearly .",

    "the adler zero in the numerator makes the amplitude small near the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "however , in a production process , the numerator need not contain the adler zero , and is in fact consistent within rather small errors with a constant .",
    "the @xmath0 pole appeared clearly in e791 data on @xmath25 @xcite and bes data on @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "both sets of data show a conspicuous peak visible by eye at @xmath27 mev .",
    "1 shows the dalitz plot and mass projections for bes data .",
    "there are conspicuous diagonal bands due to the @xmath0 and @xmath28 and vertical / horizontal bands due to @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath8 mass projection is shown in ( b ) and the @xmath0 component in ( d ) .",
    "those data may be fitted simultaneously with elastic scattering data ; bes found a pole at @xmath30 mev .",
    "[ htb ]    -12 mm -51.5 mm    since 2004 , couplings to @xmath4 and @xmath31 have been determined by fitting ( a ) all available data on @xmath32 and @xmath31 , ( b ) kloe and novosibirsk data on @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "all these data agree on a substantial coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "a further refinement is to include in the breit - wigner denominator a dispersive correction @xmath34 ( discussed below ) .",
    "the @xmath0 pole moves to @xmath35 mev .",
    "there was some debate whether the peak could be due to interference with a ` background ' .",
    "however , bes data give a phase variation with @xmath10 consistent with elastic scattering and hence a simple pole @xcite . secondly",
    ", caprini et al . calculated a prediction from the roy equations and driving forces on the left - hand cut @xcite .",
    "the great merit of this calculation is that it maps out the magnitude and phase of the s - wave amplitude over the whole of the low mass region of the complex @xmath10-plane , including the sub - threshold region inaccessible to experiment .",
    "this leaves no possible doubt of the existence of the pole and gives a pole position @xmath36 mev .",
    "however , the result for @xmath37 does not reproduce accurately the upper side of the @xmath0 peak in bes data .",
    "a combined fit to their predictions and bes data using @xmath38 instead of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) gives @xmath39 mev without departing from their predicted phases by more than @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "understanding the @xmath0 pole requires some gymnastics in complex variables .",
    "it lies at @xmath41 gev@xmath42 , not too far above the @xmath8 threshold but far into the complex plane .",
    "the phase shift is @xmath43 just above the pole .",
    "but on the real @xmath10-axis where experiments are done , the phase shift must go to 0 at the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "there is therefore a strong variation of the phase as one moves into the complex plane .",
    "this arises directly from the cauchy - riemann equations : the adler zero gives a real part of the amplitude rising nearly linearly with @xmath10 at low mass , and there must be a corresponding variation of the imaginary part of the amplitude with @xmath44 . roughly speaking , the pole would give rise to a phase shift approaching @xmath45 at 1 gev , but the effect of unitarity is to distort the phase observed on the real @xmath10-axis to @xmath43 at 1 gev .",
    "for the @xmath1 , the effect is even larger .",
    "the @xmath1 pole lies almost below the @xmath46 threshold and is very broad .",
    "the consequence is that the phase shift measured on the real @xmath10 axis only reaches @xmath47 at 1400 mev / c .    at the hadron95 conference ,",
    "mike scadron asked me if there could be a @xmath1 resonance below 1 gev . at the time , the only reply which could be given was that it must be very broad if it exists at all .",
    "later , zheng and collaborators @xcite showed that including the adler zero in the fit to lass phase shifts for @xmath46 elastic scattering and including the effects of unitarity and analyticity demands a pole at @xmath48 mev , @xmath49 mev .",
    "descotes - genon and moussallam obtained a pole at @xmath50 mev , @xmath51 mev @xcite using the roy equations .",
    "a low mass peak appears in e791 data on @xmath52 @xcite and bes data on @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "experimentalists have been bewildered by the strange behaviour of the @xmath46 phase shift and have undertaken the task of determining the magnitude and phase of the @xmath54-wave amplitude in bins of mass up to 1700 mev / c @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these e791 results , the bes data and lass phase shifts may all be fitted simultaneously @xcite with @xmath55 mev .",
    "this result is rather higher in mass than the prediction from the roy equations , but again much of the discrepancy can be traced to the effect of the strong @xmath56 threshold , which was not included in the treatment of the roy equations .",
    "the way the fit to data goes is as follows .",
    "the lass data @xcite play a strong role in determining the phase of the amplitude .",
    "the bes data determine the parameters of the strong @xmath57 observed there - considerably stronger than in lass or e791 data .",
    "the e791 data determine the magnitude of the amplitude , which turns out to be accurately consistent with the phase variation when the numerator of the production amplitude is taken to be constant .",
    "this is a clear example how one can improve the precision of the analysis by fitting several sets of data simultaneously .",
    "currently , the belle , babar and cleo c collaborations make fits without the adler zero .",
    "fits including it are urgently needed to reduce the confusion .",
    "are they claiming their results demonstrate that chiral symmetry is not broken in the @xmath46 sector ?",
    "that seems unlikely in view of the fact that the adler zero is very well established in the heavier @xmath7 sector .",
    "the whole question of how resonances can be attracted to thresholds is discussed in a full length article @xcite and will be recapitulated here . in the breit - wigner denominator of a resonance , there must be dispersive terms in the real part @xmath58 in fact , the terms @xmath59 of eq .",

    "2 shows @xmath61 and @xmath62 near the @xmath4 threshold , using a form factor @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is centre of mass @xmath4 momentum in gev / c .",
    "there is a cusp in @xmath61 at the threshold .",
    "it is positive definite at the theshold , signifying additional attraction there .",
    "-8 mm -6 mm    if the cusp is superimposed on attraction from another source , for example meson exchanges , a resonance can be generated by the peak in @xmath61 .",
    "the locking of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the @xmath4 threshold is explained naturally by this cusp mechanism .    near threshold",
    ", the wave function of the resonance has a long tail , like the deuteron .",
    "this tail is purely mesonic ; contributions from coloured quarks are confined in the resonance at short range or in the decay mesons .",
    "confined quarks have kinetic energy @xmath65 ; here @xmath64 and @xmath66 are quark momentum and effective mass and @xmath67 is the wave function . to create a bound state , extra potential energy",
    "must compensate the kinetic energy of the confined particles .",
    "this again pulls the resonance towards the threshold .",
    "t \" ornqvist provides a formula allowing an estimate of the meson - meson component @xcite ; for the @xmath3 it is at least @xmath68 and for @xmath2 at least @xmath69 .",
    "other examples of resonances appearing at sharp thresholds are known : @xmath70 at the @xmath71 threshold , @xmath57 at the @xmath72 threshold , @xmath73 at the @xmath74 threshold , and @xmath75 at the @xmath76 threshold .",
    "the nonet of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be understood quantitatively in terms of meson exchanges , witness the calculations from the roy equations by caprini et al . and",
    "descotes - genon et al .",
    "janssen et al . have shown that the @xmath3 may be fitted well in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath13 exchanges in @xmath11 and @xmath78 channels @xcite .",
    "however , most mesons and baryons are explained as quark - model states .",
    "there has been much debate about ` molecules ' and multi - quark states , e.g. @xmath79 .",
    "one of the mysteries of the quark model is how confined states penetrate the confining potential and turn into mesons .",
    "how , for example , does the @xmath13 ` know ' to have the right width to create the @xmath0 pole via the roy equations ?",
    "my suggestion is that the confining potential arises as a cooperative effect between qcd at short range ( coloured quarks and gluons ) and meson exchanges at long range .",
    "meson exchanges are certainly present , witness the peaks observed at small @xmath78 and @xmath11 . if both qcd and meson exchanges contribute , the well known eigenvalue equation is @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 describe isolated @xmath83 and meson - meson configurations and @xmath84 describes mixing .",
    "this mixing pushes the eigenstate down in mass .",
    "this is the well known variational principle which minimises the eigenvalue when states mix .",
    "it is closely analogous to formation of a covalent bond in chemistry .",
    "van beveren and rupp @xcite have proposed a similar idea .",
    "they adopt a transition potential which couples states confined in a harmonic oscillator potential to outgoing waves ; they match the logarithmic derivative at a @xmath85 function transition radius @xmath86 fm , though they mention the possibility of a gradual transition with a @xmath87 dependence on radius .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 emerge from the continuum when the coupling constant to confined states increases .",
    "the simplicity of their model makes it easy to follow the movement of poles as this coupling constant is varied .",
    "they illustrated results for the @xmath1 and @xmath88 poles .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 poles on the coupling constant is tabulated in ref .",
    "the model reproduces well the amplitudes for all these states using a universal coupling constant and su3 clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the @xmath89 does not appear at the @xmath90 threshold because of its associated adler zero . if the coupling constant is increased by a factor 2.5 , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath89 all become bound states .",
    "there has been great enthusiasm for explaining states observed in charmonium physics as 4-quark states . however , valcarce et al .",
    "@xcite find from a detailed model calculation that such states always appear higher in mass than @xmath91 configurations with the same quantum numbers , unless attractive interactions arise between diquarks . at short range",
    ", coloured combinations could contribute to a lowering of the energy of the @xmath92 eigenstate .",
    "however , the long - range tail of such an eigenstate is uncoloured , taking us back to a meson - meson configuration .",
    "molecular states certainly exist as nuclei .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is a classic example of meson exchanges .",
    "there is a repulsive core due to the pauli principle pushing identical quarks apart .",
    "oset , oller and collaborators find that they can account for many resonances from a chiral lagrangian @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a meson - meson interaction with chiral symmetry breaking built in .",
    "they also include short - range @xmath93 interactions .",
    "however , the short - range interactions need to be tuned to reproduce accurately the masses , widths and branching ratios of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in the @xmath7 system ,",
    "donnachie and hamilton showed in 1965 that meson exchanges are attractive for quantum numbers where there are prominent resonances : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , etc . @xcite .",
    "ochs has waged a long campaign claiming that cern - munich ( cm ) data @xcite are better than the sum total of all other data and disprove the existence of @xmath102 .",
    "this is not true .",
    "cm data give an excellent determination of @xmath8 phase shifts @xmath85 from 610 mev to the @xmath4 threshold ( 990 mev ) .",
    "however , above this there are strong correlations between @xmath85 and elasticity parameters @xmath103 ; consequently , errors on both become large .",
    "these are illustrated in figs .",
    "4 and 6 of au , morgan and pennington @xcite and in fig . 1 of kaminski , pelaez and yndurain @xcite ; errors for @xmath103 are very large because of lack of data determining accurately the absolute magnitudes of @xmath32 , @xmath31 and particularly the dominant channel @xmath104 .",
    "it is easy to check these errors directly from errors on cm moments . for every bin ,",
    "four algebraic solutions emerge .",
    "there is some constraint on the @xmath8 d - wave from the line - shape of @xmath28 .",
    "however , there is a substantial contribution from @xmath70 , ignored by ochs .",
    "it couples strongly to @xmath105 @xcite ; the sub - threshold continuation of this channel is poorly known , as is its coupling to @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , there is large uncertainty in the d - wave contribution to moments @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "also the @xmath110 and @xmath111 can not be identified in cm data , leading to further poorly identified contributions to @xmath108 , @xmath112 and @xmath109 .",
    "all these systematic uncertainties accumulate in @xmath109 , which determines the s - wave intensity ; it can be fitted very flexibly .",
    "3 shows my fit to cm moments using fully analytic functions ( a major constraint ) .",
    "some mixing is required ( and expected ) between @xmath102 , @xmath0 and @xmath95 , which overlap strongly .",
    "mixing induces a phase rotation of the @xmath102 , see @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]    -12 mm -8 mm    the problem in identifying @xmath102 is that its @xmath113 decay is obscured in many sets of data by @xmath28 .",
    "however , it produces a clearly visible peak in @xmath114 at rest ; this peak can not be due to @xmath28 which has a branching fraction to @xmath31 of only 0.4% .",
    "it is also visible as a peak in bes data for @xmath115 @xcite , where angular correlations between production and decay of the @xmath116 separate @xmath117 and @xmath118 cleanly .",
    "it was first observed in 3 sets of data on @xmath32 from anl and bnl @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "its parameters are best determined by crystal barrel data on @xmath119 at rest in liquid and gaseous hydrogen ; these data separate @xmath120 and @xmath121 annihilation , which give independent determinations of mass and width agreeing within @xmath122 and @xmath123 mev respectively .",
    "crystal barrel data on charge combinations of @xmath124 give consistent parameters with all other data @xcite .",
    "the resonance mass is @xmath125 mev with a full - width at half maximum of @xmath126 mev .",
    "however , the rapid opening of the @xmath104 threshold moves the peak in @xmath104 higher by @xmath127 mev because of phase space .",
    "the opening of the @xmath104 channel was not taken into account in most analyses , leading to confusion and inflated errors .",
    "the @xmath102 was observed by gasparo @xcite and then by crystal barrel , obelix and wa102 in many sets of @xmath104 data @xcite .",
    "when one allows for @xmath104 phase space and the associated dispersive effect , all observations where both @xmath128 and @xmath95 have been fitted are close to consistency within errors .",
    "with the @xmath102 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 well established , there is one state too many to fit as @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the glueball predicted in this mass range by lattice gauge calculations mixes with the @xmath93 states .",
    "the @xmath96 decays almost purely to @xmath4 , with a possible small @xmath31 decay .",
    "the @xmath95 behaves as an octet state with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "an intriguing result is the sharp @xmath133 signal reported by the bes collaboration @xcite , peaking at 1812 mev , just above the @xmath134 threshold at 1801 mev .",
    "a purely threshold effect should peak much higher .",
    "it is therefore probably due to @xmath97 , a resonance clearly separated from @xmath96 in bes data on @xmath135 @xcite , @xmath136 @xcite , @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "there is a strong @xmath96 peak in @xmath139 data , but nothing in @xmath136 despite large statistics .",
    "conversely , the @xmath97 appears clearly in @xmath140 , but not in @xmath138 .",
    "there is a factor 22 difference in decay branching ratios to @xmath8 and @xmath4 , requiring separate @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath97 was first observed in @xmath141 @xcite @xcite .",
    "it makes a natural radial excitation of @xmath102 .    the @xmath134 decay can arise naturally from a glueball component in @xmath97 @xcite",
    "a glueball is a flavour singlet with flavour content @xmath142 [ the @xmath130 component might be enhanced with respect to @xmath143 by a factor @xmath144 . ]",
    "the component @xmath145 can make @xmath146 or @xmath147 or a linear combination .",
    "bes i data on @xmath148 show that the @xmath149 channel contains no significant @xmath150 signal @xcite . a signal with the same magnitude as that of @xmath151 would be conspicuous near 1800 mev .",
    "its absence may be qualitatively explained by the larger phase space for @xmath152 in @xmath4 decays than in @xmath153 .",
    "in fitting @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is essential to include the adler zero explicitly into the breit - wigner denominator - or demonstrate that such a fit is unacceptably bad .",
