    "there are at least two kinds of selection effects at work , which have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite : ( 1 ) grb detection and localization ; and ( 2 ) redshift determination through spectroscopy / photometry of the grb afterglow or the host galaxy .",
    "a full address of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper , so i only give a brief description on them .    since all the grbs in the sample used in this paper ( and in",
    "* ) are detected by burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard , biases arising from grb detection are minimized although the sensitivity of bat is very difficult to parameterize exactly @xcite .",
    "an effective luminosity threshold introduced above and in @xcite would be a reasonable approximation of the detection criteria for the bursts in the sample .",
    "due to the transient nature of grbs , a fast and accurate location of the burst is crucial for the determination of the redshift .",
    "the automatic slew ability and the muti - wavelength nature of  have led that an accurate localization of the grb is possible shortly after its detection , with an efficiency higher than any previous grb observatory ( e.g. , _ bepposax _ and _ hete2 _ ) .",
    "an impressive number of ground - based facilities ( dedicated robotic telescopes , vlt , gemini , keck , etc ) have been involved in follow - up observations . however",
    ", optical afterglows have been discovered for only @xmath147 of  grbs , a fraction only slightly greater than that of _ bepposax _ and _ hete2 _ samples @xcite .",
    "the cause for the non - detection of optical afterglows for well localized grbs remains a puzzle @xcite .",
    "generally , an apparently bright burst would be easier to localize than an apparently faint burst . on average more distant bursts",
    "are expected to have lower observed gamma - ray fluxes , hence the number of grbs with hight redshift might have been somewhat underestimated . but",
    "this indicates that the deviation of the grb rate from that predicted by the sfr could be more serious than that has been observed @xcite .    for the grbs detected and localized by ,",
    "most of them are followed - up spectroscopically by ground - based telescopes .",
    "the participation of ground - based telescopes in follow - up observations has greatly increased the number of grbs with redshifts ( about @xmath148 of the total  grbs ) . however",
    ", this also makes the selection biases in the redshift determination extremely complex , since instrumental selection biases of different telescopes have to be involved .",
    "different techniques have also been applied in the redshift measurement : absorption lines , emission lines and photometry of the lyman edge , which causes additional biases .",
    "in addition to the various selection biases in redshift measurements discussed above , there has been a well - known ` redshift desert ' in the redshift interval @xmath149 since galaxies in that range have been hard to detect spectroscopically with traditional ground - based telescopes @xcite . however , the ` redshift desert ' problem does not seem to be serious for grbs , since among the 85 long grbs with measured redshifts by 31 march 2008 , 23 bursts are in the redshift interval @xmath149 ( fig .",
    "[ qq_distr2u ] ) .",
    "this is probably caused by the fact that different telescopes have different spectral ranges and they complement each other to some degrees .",
    "there is evidence that grbs are beamed @xcite .",
    "hence , when discussing the probability distribution function of grbs , the effect of jet beaming must be taken into account . assuming that a grb radiates its energy into two oppositely directed jets , each having a half - opening angle @xmath150 .",
