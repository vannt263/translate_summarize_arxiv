    "in spontaneously broken supersymmetric theories , there is a spin - half goldstino fermion which is eaten by the gravitino as its longitudinal components . by supersymmetry",
    ", the goldstino must be accompanied with its superpartner whose spin is zero if supersymmetry is broken by a vacuum expectation value of the @xmath3-component of a chiral superfield .",
    "a chiral supermultiplet is formed by the goldstino , its scalar superpartner , and the non - vanishing @xmath3-term , which we call the chiral superfield @xmath4 .",
    "the low energy physics is then described by matter superfields , gauge superfields and the chiral superfield @xmath4 .",
    "there are variety of possibilities for couplings between matter / gauge superfields in the supersymmetric standard model and the superfield @xmath4 .",
    "these possibilities have been classified as follows .",
    "if we assume that the couplings are suppressed by the planck scale @xmath5 , such as @xmath6_{\\theta^2}$ ] with @xmath7 being gauge fields , the model is called the `` gravity mediation ''  @xcite .",
    "another possibility that the gauge kinetic function is of the form , @xmath8_{\\theta^2}$ ] , is called the `` gauge mediation ''  @xcite .",
    "this is the form we obtain after integrating out vector - like fields which obtain masses proportional to @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "if the coupling is more suppressed than the planck scale , effects of the `` anomaly mediation  @xcite '' give the largest contribution to supersymmetry breaking terms in the lagrangian . among those scenarios ,",
    "gauge mediation assumes the strongest interaction between the matter / gauge fields and @xmath4 while the anomaly mediation effects are the weakest .",
    "the size of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath10 , therefore has a relation , @xmath11 , when we fix the scale of gaugino / sfermion masses .",
    "the gravitino masses are @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the question is what size of the gravitino mass ( i.e. , the supersymmetry breaking scale ) is preferred by phenomenological and cosmological requirements .",
    "this is an interesting question since each scenario predicts a quite different pattern in the spectrum of the supersymmetric particles , which we will search for at the lhc experiments .",
    "strategies for finding supersymmetric particles and measurements of model parameters will be also different for different scales of @xmath14 .",
    "there have been many model - building efforts in making supersymmetric models realistic in each category : gravity , gauge or anomaly mediation .",
    "if one of them had been completely successful , we could have believed in the scenario and used the model as the _ standard supersymmetric model_. however , unfortunately , there is no such a standard model so far because of the fact that neither of these scenarios are fully realistic by different reasons . in the gauge and anomaly mediation scenarios ,",
    "there is a problem with the electroweak symmetry breaking , i.e. , the @xmath0-problem . the pure anomaly mediation , in addition , predicts tachyonic scalar leptons which are not acceptable . although the gravity mediation scenario does not suffer from those problems , it has been known that sizes of flavor and cp violation are expected to be too large .",
    "there are also cosmological constraints .",
    "in particular , in gravity mediation models , a moduli problem caused by fields in the supersymmetry breaking sector destroys cosmological successes of the ( supersymmetric ) standard model  @xcite , such as the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and also cold dark matter by thermal - relic neutralinos .    in this paper , we reconsider problems in supersymmetric models by using an effective field theory described by the field @xmath4 and the matter / gauge fields . by doing so , we can discuss each of these scenarios as a different choice of functions of @xmath4 which define an effective theory .",
    "the labeling can be done by projecting the function space onto a one - dimensional axis of the gravitino mass . in this formulation",
    ", we find that there is a sweet spot in between the gauge and gravity mediation ( @xmath15  gev ) where the theory is perfectly consistent with various requirements .",
    "all the classic problems , such as the flavor / cp problem and the @xmath0-problem are absent .",
    "the theory also avoids a cosmological moduli problem caused by the scalar component of @xmath4 .",
    "non - thermally produced gravitinos through the decay of the @xmath4-condensation naturally account for dark matter of the universe .",
    "a simple ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the theory exists , which is actually a model of grand unification without neither the doublet - triplet splitting problem nor the proton decay problem .",
    "relations to the strong cp problem and the supersymmetric fine - tuning problem are also addressed .",
    "we discuss a characteristic spectrum of supersymmetric particles , and demonstrate how we can confirm this scenario .    in the next section ,",
    "we rewrite the various supersymmetric models in terms of the effective lagrangian described by the goldstino multiplet @xmath4 and particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the section includes review of the supersymmetry breaking and its transmission . a concrete set - up",
    "is defined in subsection  [ sec : sss ] and discuss its successes there .",
    "we then discuss low energy predictions of the framework in section  [ sec : low - energy ] .",
    "a parametrization of the model and a way of calculating the spectrum of supersymmetric particles are presented .",
    "collider signatures are discussed in section  [ sec : lhc ] .",
    "we demonstrate a method of extracting model parameters in the case where the scalar tau ( stau ) is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "we construct a phenomenological lagrangian of the supersymmetric standard model and consider various requirements from particle physics and cosmology .",
    "we will arrive at a scenario with @xmath16  gev .",
    "we derive here a description of a supersymmetry breaking sector by the goldstino chiral superfield @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the construction of the higgs sector in the standard model .",
    "as any models of the electroweak symmetry breaking flow into the standard model with various mass ranges of the higgs boson at low energy , the model below provides a standard low energy description of a variety of supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath3-term supersymmetry breaking scenarios as most of the supersymmetry breaking models are of this type . to ensure a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the @xmath3-component of a chiral superfield @xmath4",
    ", we add a source term in the lagrangian : @xmath17 this term can be expressed in terms of the superfield as follows : @xmath18    we can also write down an arbitrary khler potential , @xmath19 , for the kinetic and interaction terms of @xmath4 . as long as @xmath20 is a non - singular function , @xmath21 is obtained by the equation of motion .",
    "for example , the low energy effective theory of the oraifeartaigh model  @xcite has a khler potential : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass scale of the massive fields which have been integrated out .",

    "the fermionic component of @xmath4 remains massless .",
    "this is the goldstino fermion associated with the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "note that the existence of the chiral superfield @xmath4 in the above effective theory does not necessarily mean that the supersymmetry breaking sector contains a gauge singlet chiral superfield in the uv theory .",
    "the @xmath4 field can originate from a component of some multiplets or can be a composite operator in physics above a ` cut - off ' scale @xmath23 .",
    "it is totally a general argument that there is a gauge singlet chiral superfield @xmath4 in the effective theory below the scale of supersymmetry breaking dynamics , @xmath23 , as long as @xmath27 .",
    "the lagrangian discussed above is analogous to the higgs sector in the standard model .",
    "the two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the higgs potential , @xmath32 .",
    "we should not trust this effective theory if @xmath33 as it violates the unitarity of scattering amplitudes of the gravitinos at high energy just like the standard model with @xmath34 .",
    "the superpotential of the mssm is @xmath35 where we suppressed the yukawa coupling constants and flavor indices .",
    "the last term , the @xmath0-term , is needed to give a mass to the higgsino , but it should not be too large . for supersymmetry to be a solution to the hierarchy problem ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath36 , the @xmath0-term is necessary to be of the order of the electroweak scale ( or scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms ) .",
    "this is called the @xmath0-problem .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is much smaller than the planck scale suggests that the combination of @xmath37 carries some approximately conserving charge .",
    "there are many gauge invariant operators we can write down in addition to the above superpotential such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 these are unwanted operators as they cause too rapid proton decays .    the @xmath0-problem and the proton decay problem above are actually related , and there is a simple solution to both problems .",
    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry with the following charge assignment avoids too large @xmath0-term and the proton decay operators .",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 this symmetry is broken explicitly by the @xmath0-term , @xmath42 . since it is a small breaking of the pq symmetry , the coefficients of the dimension five operators are sufficiently suppressed . the unbroken @xmath43 symmetry , which includes the @xmath44-parity as a subgroup , still forbids the superpotential terms in eq .",

    "the majorana neutrino mass terms , @xmath45 , are forbidden by the pq symmetry , but large enough coefficients can be obtained by introducing another explicit breaking of the pq symmetry .",
    "for example , we can write down @xmath46 with @xmath47 without introducing proton decay operators or too large @xmath0-term .",
    "the @xmath43 symmetry above is broken down to the @xmath44-parity with this term .",
    "in fact , there is another symmetry which can play the same role as the pq symmetry , called @xmath44-symmetry .",
    "the charge assignment is @xmath48 @xmath49 again , @xmath50 explicitly breaks the @xmath44-symmetry down to the @xmath44-parity . in this case , the @xmath51 term is allowed by the symmetry .    in summary , there are approximate symmetries , u(1)@xmath52 and u(1)@xmath53 , in the lagrangian of the mssm .",
    "if one of them is a good ( approximate ) symmetry of the whole system , it provides us with a solution to the @xmath0 and the proton decay problems .",
    "now we discuss interaction terms between the @xmath4-sector and the mssm sector .",
    "these interactions determine the pattern of supersymmetry breaking parameters which are relevant for low energy physics .",
    "we review here three famous mechanisms ; gravity , gauge , and anomaly mediation models , as choices of the form of the interactions .",
    "each of these scenarios suffer from different problems .",
    "understanding nature of those problems guides us to a phenomenologically consistent model .",
    "the simplest scenario is to assume general interaction terms suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "this is called the gravity mediation .",
    "the khler potential is @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the quark and lepton superfields in the mssm , and we omit @xmath1 coefficients .",

    "the pq symmetry must , therefore , be maximally violated .",
    "this implies that none of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravity - higgs ] ) can be forbidden by approximate symmetries of the theory .",
    "this fact becomes important in the discussion of the supersymmetric cp problem .    even though the @xmath0-problem is solved perfectly",

    "the energy density of the oscillation then dominates over the universe unless the displacement is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "the decay of @xmath4 , in turn , either destroys the success of the bbn  @xcite or overproduce gravitinos  @xcite depending on the mass range of @xmath24 ( see @xcite for earlier works ) .",
    "there is no range of @xmath24 which is consistent with the cosmology  @xcite .",
    "it has been widely accepted that the lightest neutralino accounts for dark matter of the universe in gravity mediation scenarios .",
    "abundance of thermally produced neutralinos can be calculated without information on the detail history of the universe , and we obtain the correct order of magnitude . however , once we take into account the existence of the superpartner of the goldstino , @xmath4 , which always exists , the successful cosmology is spoiled .",
    "we argue that an assumption made in the standard calculation that the universe was normal up to temperatures of @xmath60  gev is inconsistent with the structure of underlying models .",
    "some of shortcomings in gravity mediation can be cured in gauge mediation models .",
    "we assume in gauge mediation that the size of the supersymmetry breaking , @xmath10 ( and therefore @xmath14 ) , is much smaller than that in gravity mediation .",

    "this is perfectly consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking and also the absence of the cp phase in @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
