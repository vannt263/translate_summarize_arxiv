    "pion double charge exchange ( dcx ) , a nuclear reaction in which two units of charge are exchanged between a pion and a nucleus , is an important tool with which to investigate the details of the pion - nucleus interactions as well as correlations between nucleons within the nucleus .",
    "dcx is unique among pion - nuclear scattering reactions , as it must involve at least two nucleons in order to conserve charge .",
    "thus , the physiognomy of the dcx process revealed by the experimental cross section depends on the coordinates of two particles in the wavefunction of the nucleus . as a probe of the pion - nucleus interaction , dcx",
    "may be used to isolate contributions from different types of reaction mechanisms .",
    "other pion - nucleus reactions appear to be dominated by single scattering mechanisms , but dcx must proceed through less simple mechanisms such as double scattering , as shown in fig .",
    "an experimental investigation of dcx in @xmath0he at intermediate energies ( 120270 mev ) has been performed in order to study the multiple scattering mechanisms of the @xmath7-nucleus reaction directly . the choice of @xmath0he as a nuclear target allows an investigation of dcx in an extensively studied few - body system for which microscopic treatment of the dynamics is possible in principle . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath0he nucleus has a large density which may allow some effects of the nuclear medium to be investigated .",
    "the final state is also relatively simple , consisting of a pion and either four protons or four neutrons , resulting from , respectively , the reactions @xmath0he@xmath1 and @xmath0he@xmath2 .",
    "the first investigation of dcx in @xmath0he was reported by davis _ et al._@xcite in 1964 . this and several subsequent measurements @xcite of dcx cross sections in @xmath5he and @xmath0he were undertaken as searches for bound three- or four - neutron states using the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "more broadly motivated studies of dcx in @xmath0he at energies above the @xmath8 resonance were carried out using liquid helium bubble chambers @xcite . in the energy range",
    "98156 mev total cross section measurements were performed by falomkin _",
    "et al._@xcite using a high - pressure helium streamer chamber .",
    "although some interesting phenomena were observed in these experiments , the limited statistics precluded quantitative conclusions .",
    "@xcite contains a critical review of these and other experiments on @xmath0he .",
    "other early dcx experiments on various nuclei which used nuclear emulsions , bubble chambers , and spark chambers as detectors are described in refs.@xcite .    the first modern measurement of doubly differential cross sections for inclusive dcx , using a magnetic spectrometer to detect the outgoing pions , was made at the schweizerisches institut f \" ur nuklearforschung ( now psi ) for the @xmath9o@xmath10 reaction @xcite .",

    "one spectrum was a re - measurement of the spectrum reported by kaufman _",
    "et al._@xcite at 140 mev , and confirmed that the normalization of the older data was incorrect ( too small ) by a factor of 100 , as had been suspected .",
    "six additional spectra were measured with pions at the two higher incident energies , and one spectrum for the @xmath0he@xmath12 reaction was observed at 295 mev incident energy .",
    "total and differential cross sections and pion momentum distributions have been measured at six energies in the 70130 mev range using the chaos detector at triumf@xcite .",
    "some evidence for a @xmath13 dibaryon state of mass 2.06 gev is claimed to be found in the energy dependence of the total dcx cross section .",
    "an extensive study of the @xmath5he@xmath12 reaction@xcite in the incident energy range 120  240 mev was carried out with the same apparatus as that used in the experiment reported in this paper .",
    "the @xmath5he data , with good statistical accuracy and complete coverage of the outgoing pion energy spectrum , revealed a double - peaked structure at forward angles @xcite .",
    "this result is in striking contrast to the spectra seen in a systematic study of dcx on heavier nuclei ( @xmath9o to @xmath14pb )  @xcite , in which this structure is absent , and which roughly resemble the distribution of events in four - body phase space .",
    "a hint of this structure had been seen in the earlier @xmath5he dcx data of sperinde _",
    "et al._@xcite , whereas it was not apparent in the @xmath0he data of kaufman _",
    "et al._@xcite or those of stetz _ et al._@xcite .",
    "the first microscopic calculation of the dcx process in @xmath0he was reported by becker and schmit@xcite , using a reaction model developed by becker and mari@xcite .",
    "the sequential single - charge - exchange ( sscx ) mechanism is calculated in a fixed - nucleon ( fn ) framework , and only resonant [ @xmath15 amplitudes are used to describe the @xmath6 interaction , with an off - shell correction factor .",
    "total cross section predictions of this calculation are presented in ref .",

    ". the quantitative disagreement should be expected at the very least from the use of plane waves to describe the outgoing pions , i.e. , the effects of absorption and multiple scattering are not included .",
    "germond and wilkin@xcite proposed that a major contribution to dcx might come from a pion - pion scattering mechanism , as shown in fig .",
    "the amplitude is calculated for a nucleon pair , drawing on the current algebra theory of weinberg@xcite for the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "the pion  cloud \" between the nucleon pair is calculated with a relativistic expression derived from the pseudoscalar pion and dirac nucleon theory described by bjorken and drell@xcite .",
    "the relatively large total cross sections obtained fueled speculation that this mechanism was important .",

    "1(c ) must also be included , and it was found by robilotta and wilkin@xcite that its amplitude cancels that of the mechanism in fig .",
    "1(b ) to a large extent .    jeanneret _ et al._@xcite considered a model of dcx in which pion - induced pion production ( pipp ) is followed by two - nucleon absorption of one of the two final pions .",
    "the calculation is a convolution of the free pipp cross section and pion absorption cross section in deuterium @xmath17 , with some corrections for the available phase space . at the high energies of their experiment ( 1.52.0 gev ) , the authors find general agreement of their predictions with their measured total cross sections .",
    "the calculation of gibbs , gibson , hess , and stephenson @xcite was based on the same reaction model as that of becker and schmit@xcite , but brought to bear the more sophisticated techniques pioneered by gibbs and his co - workers @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a simpler approximation of those methods was used in the dcx calculation ; specifically , the coupled scattering equations were not solved .",
    "the initial and final pion states as well as the final nucleon states were described with plane waves , although the effect of simple fsi between the spectator nucleon pair was investigated .",
    "a pion scattering amplitude from fixed nucleon positions was calculated , and then averaged by the @xmath0he wavefunction .",
    "the final nucleon momenta were integrated over the available phase space using a monte carlo technique .",
    "the total cross section predicted by this calculation is a factor of 100 smaller than that measured in the energy region 98156 mev by falomkin _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this theoretical result is in fact consistent with the approximate agreement found with the kaufman _",
    "measurement@xcite at 140 mev , which is now known to have been incorrectly normalized by a factor of 100 .",
    "the calculation also underpredicts the @xmath18 excitation function for 176 mev pions measured by gilly _ et al._@xcite and the pion momentum spectrum measured at 485 mev by carayannopoulos _ et al._@xcite ; however , the authors @xcite comment that the calculation is not expected to work well at the higher incident energies .",
    "a series of papers containing theoretical predictions for dcx cross sections in @xmath5he and @xmath0he was published by jibuti and kezerashvili@xcite .",
    "their basic approach was to expand initial and final nuclear wavefunctions in a hyperspherical basis , solving four - body equations for the @xmath0he nucleus using various models of the @xmath19 potential . in refs .",
    "@xcite these wavefunctions were used to calculate dcx cross sections in @xmath0he using the exact same form of the double scattering operator as used by gibbs _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , agreement was found with both the incorrect data of kaufman@xcite and the presumably correct data of gilly _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "a similar calculation for dcx in @xmath5he was reported@xcite several years later , and successfully reproduced the spectrum measured by sperinde _",

    "in addition , the operator for the @xmath16 scattering mechanism was extracted without change from germond and wilkin@xcite and inserted between their wavefunctions .",
    "two predictions of dcx energy spectra ",
    "one using the @xmath16 mechanism of germond and wilkin and one using the sscx mechanism of gibbs  were compared to one of the spectra measured by stetz _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "both predictions agreed quite well with the data , and no combination of the two was discussed , in this article or in later work@xcite .    a completely different approach to calculating inclusive reaction cross sections has been taken by several other authors@xcite .",

    "the phase space was calculated relativistically , an antisymmetrized initial wave function was used , the spin and isospin coefficients were recalculated , and the newer @xmath7-nucleon phase shift parametrization of rowe , salomon , and landau@xcite was used .",
    "this calculation yielded cross sections substantially larger than those of ref .",
    "@xcite , but still failed to reproduce either the magnitude or energy dependence of the kaufman@xcite or gilly@xcite cross sections .",

    "kulkarni@xcite also constructed a relativistic three - body model of @xmath7-nuclear interactions , and applied it to dcx .",
    "this calculation will be described briefly and its results compared with the present data in section vii .    a recent paper by alqadi and gibbs @xcite reported calculations of @xmath0he(@xmath24 ) cross sections using two different methods : the two - nucleon sequential single charge exchange model and an intranuclear cascade code .",

    "preliminary results of this experiment have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed with incident @xmath27 beams from the high - energy pion channel ( `` p@xmath5 '' ) at lampf .",
    "the experimental apparatus and procedure have been discussed in detail by wood _",
    "et al._@xcite and yuly _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and will be treated only briefly here .",
    "the outgoing pions were detected using a 180@xmath3 vertical bend , double focusing magnetic spectrometer , with an effective solid angle of about 16 msr and a momentum bite of about 8% ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the 180@xmath3 bend of the magnet provides stringent selection of the charge of the detected particle , and the short flight path ( 3.5 m ) , which was entirely in vacuum except for a 2.5 cm interruption for a mid- spectrometer wire chamber , allowed low - energy pions to reach the focal plane with minimal corrections for scattering and decay .",
    "since no detectors are required at the entrance to the spectrometer , high luminosities could be used .",
    "the detector system had five components : a wire chamber ( wc0 ) placed in the mid - plane of the spectrometer , two wire chambers ( wc1 and wc2 ) near the focal plane that were used to reconstruct trajectories , behind these , a 1.6 mm scintillator ( s1 ) , that provided an accurate time reference for the trigger as well as pulse height information useful in the identification of particles , and lastly a fluorocarbon ( fc-88 ) erenkov detector that distinguished electrons from pions .",
    "the trigger was a fourfold coincidence among the three wire chambers and the scintillator .",
    "inclusion of the mid - spectrometer wire chamber guaranteed that a particle had passed through the spectrometer , which accomplished a crucial reduction of the trigger rate due to room background .",
    "the timing information available from this chamber was also used to distinguish pions from very slow protons .",
    "the liquid @xmath0he target was a cylindrical cell 25 mm in diameter and 75 mm high with a 51 @xmath28 m thick mylar wall .",
    "it was surrounded by four layers of 0.64 @xmath28 m aluminized mylar super - insulation and , at a radius of 19 cm , a 13 @xmath28 m aluminum heat shield maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "the insulating vacuum of the cryostat was contiguous with that of the spectrometer vacuum chamber .",
    "the top of the cell was connected to the bottom of a 30 liter reservoir , which fed liquid @xmath0he to the target under the force of gravity .",
    "the target cell and a ch ( styrofoam ) cylinder of the same dimensions were mounted vertically on the axis of rotation of the spectrometer .",
    "an elevator mechanism could position each of the targets in the path of the beam , permitting convenient measurement of @xmath29 scattering , which was the reference cross section in this experiment .",
    "background from the helium target cell walls was measured by detecting pions from the same cell after the helium had been evacuated .",
    "the measured yield from the empty cell was typically less than 10% of the yield measured when the cell contained liquid helium .",
    "the temperature of the @xmath0he was determined by the vapor pressure in the reservoir , which was essentially the same as the local atmospheric pressure ( 584 @xmath30 13 mmhg ) plus 0.5 lb / in@xmath31 overpressure from a gas outflow meter .",
    "interpolating from empirical measurements of liquid @xmath0he density as a function of vapor pressure one finds a density of @xmath32 mg / cm@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0he target density determination was checked in a subsequent experiment on dcx in @xmath5he @xcite . since at temperatures below that necessary",
    "to liquify @xmath5he ( 2.17k ) liquid @xmath0he becomes superfluid and no longer boils , its density is known more reliably .",
    "the density measurements reported in this paper were found to be in excellent agreement with those made subsequently with the superfluid @xmath0he target .    before reaching the target ,",
    "the pion beam passed through an ionization chamber , which was used to determine the relative flux .",
    "since this device was sensitive to all charged particles in the beam , it was necessary to normalize the flux measurement each time the beam transport elements were adjusted .",
    "the size ( about 1.6 cm in diameter ) and position of the beam spot were continuously monitored by a small multi - wire proportional chamber placed downstream of the ionization chamber and 30 cm upstream of the target .",
    "downstream of the @xmath0he target , the pion beam struck a 6 mm thick polyethylene ( ch@xmath34 ) target .",
    "three - element plastic scintillator telescopes were placed on each side of the ch@xmath34 target to detect pions scattered at @xmath35 .",
    "these telescopes were used to monitor the position of the incident beam , as well as to provide a check on the flux determined by the ionization chamber .",
    "the response of the telescopes was sensitive essentially only to pions , since beam contaminants are very unlikely to scatter at 90@xmath3 into the telescopes .    to measure the doubly differential cross sections the target was exposed to an incident pion beam and events",
    "were collected at given spectrometer momentum settings until statistical uncertainties of approximately 5% in the number of detected pions were achieved .",
    "data were collected at 10 mev intervals in outgoing pion energy .",
    "in addition to each complete set of @xmath0he observations , a series of observations was made measuring the background from the empty target walls .",
    "this process was repeated for each spectrometer angle and incident energy .",
    "each time the incident energy , and hence the normalization of the beam monitors , was changed , a series of ch normalizations , that covered the same range of angles but in smaller steps , was performed .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to measure a doubly differential cross section for each reaction , incident pion energy , scattering angle , and outgoing pion energy studied .",
    "the doubly differential cross section is related to observable quantities as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of pions detected , @xmath38 is the number of pions that were incident , @xmath39 is the effective thickness of the target , @xmath40 is the density of the target , @xmath41 is the effective solid angular acceptance of the spectrometer , @xmath26 is the outgoing pion kinetic energy and @xmath42 is its range , @xmath43 is a correction of the spectrometer acceptance due to multiple scattering and energy loss , @xmath44 is the correction due to pion decay , and @xmath45 is the dead - time correction .    the analysis procedure is described in detail in @xcite and will only be summarized here .",
    "( see also ref@xcite . )",
    "calibration constants relating time differences of signals from wire chambers to position were established by placing a collimated @xmath46fe source at precisely measured positions in front of the chambers .",
    "for each event , the position information from wc1 and wc2 was used to reconstruct the particle trajectory back to the focal plane of the spectrometer .",
    "reconstructed trajectories were tested for conformity with the distribution in phase space of particles that could have been transmitted by the spectrometer from the target to the focal plane .      to calculate cross sections it was necessary to separate the pions from the other particle species that also caused triggers .",
    "protons were generally eliminated by their large pulse heights in the scintillator . at a spectrometer momentum setting of about 156 mev / c , where the protons were just reaching the scintillator , however , many of the protons deposited the same amount of energy as the pions in the scintillator . at this momentum , the protons were distinguished by their longer time - of - flight between wc0 and s1 .    since pions , as well as electrons ,",
    "emit erenkov radiation at spectrometer settings greater than 180 mev / c ( @xmath47 mev ) , it was not possible to use the erenkov detector to distinguish electrons from pions on an event - by - event basis . instead , a statistical method was used , which is described in detail in @xcite and is very similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the momentum acceptance , @xmath48 , and dispersion were determined by scanning a @xmath49 elastic scattering peak from the ch target across the spectrometer focal plane by changing the spectrometer magnetic field .",
    "the changing acceptance across the focal plane resulted in changes in the observed area of the peak .",
    "the relative acceptance as a function of focal plane position was determined by this method , and was used to correct @xmath50 .",
    "the effective total momentum acceptance was determined to be about 8% by integration across the entire focal plane .      the absolute number of incident pions , @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xsect ] ) , was obtained by comparison of @xmath29 elastic scattering measurements from the ch target with known cross sections determined by interpolation using the energy - dependent phase shift program scatpi  @xcite . in this way , the effective total solid angle , @xmath41 , and the effective target thickness , @xmath39 , were included in this calibration .",
    "this procedure was repeated at several scattering angles for each setting of the beam transport system in order to improve the accuracy of the normalization , as well as to check for the presence of angle - dependent effects .",
    "the pions counted with the empty target were primarily those scattered from the walls of the target cell .",
    "the background was typically only about 8% , and never more than 15% , of the full - target rate , and was measured to about 30% accuracy .",
    "the measurements with the empty target were analyzed in the same manner as those with the full target , and properly normalized background data were subtracted point - by - point from the full - target data .      corrections ( see eq . ( 1 ) ) were made to account for other effects that would change the shape and magnitude of the cross section distributions .",
    "the number of pions detected was reduced by decay as they travelled from the target to the detectors .",
    "approximately 80% of the pions survived at 200 mev , while at 10 mev only 30% survived . some of the decay muons traversed the spectrometer , while others did not .",
    "in fact , it is possible for pions that would not have traversed the spectrometer to decay into muons that could .",
    "since the detector system could not separate the muons from pions , these effects were computed by monte carlo methods which produced the factor @xmath44 in eq.([eqn : xsect ] ) .",
    "this procedure is described in greater detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "muon contamination from pion decay in the spectrometer was simulated with the decay turtle  @xcite code .",
    "the fraction of muon contamination ranges from 1% at 10 mev to 20% at 200 mev outgoing pion kinetic energy .",
    "a different monte carlo program , mucloud  @xcite , was used to simulate decays in the scattering chamber .",
    "mucloud used the uncorrected cross sections in an iterative procedure to obtain the corrections , which were typically 030% .",
    "energy loss and multiple scattering in the target and in wc0 changed the effective acceptance of the spectrometer ; these were corrected for by the factor @xmath43 , which was determined by simulation to be different from unity only for outgoing pion energies less than 30 mev .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath43 was about 1.3 .",
    "integration of the doubly differential cross sections over outgoing pion energy yielded an angular distribution .",
    "this integration was carried out using the trapezoid rule .",
    "the cross section below the lowest measured outgoing energy of 10 mev as found by linear extrapolation to zero at zero outgoing pion energy . except for several forward - angle spectra at high incident pion energy ,",
    "the doubly differential cross sections were measured up to the kinematic limit for the dcx reaction , and thus the high - energy end of the integral required no extrapolation of the data .",
    "the exceptional cases were extrapolated linearly to zero cross section using the slope determined by the highest energy pair of cross section measurements .",
    "the uncertainty in each differential cross section was calculated as the sum in quadrature of the uncertainty in each trapezoid s area . the uncertainty in the extrapolation of the endpoints to zero cross section",
    "was estimated to be one - half of the contribution to the integral from the endpoint regions . in all cases",
    "these uncertainties@xcite were small compared with the systematic uncertainties discussed in the next section .",
    "the smooth angular dependence of the differential cross sections allows a simple method of integration over angle to determine a quantity which we term the `` total reaction cross section . ''",
    "the angular distributions between the most forward and backward angle measurements were fitted with sums of legendre polynomials in @xmath51 ; the distributions were extrapolated linearly in @xmath39 from the extreme angle measurements to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , using the derivative of the legendre polynomial sum at the extremes to define the slopes .",
    "the uncertainty in the total reaction cross section was determined by fitting the legendre polynomials to the angular distribution plus and minus the uncertainty at each angle .",
    "this uncertainty and that in the extrapolation  @xcite were less than or comparable to the systematic uncertainties discussed in the next section .",
    "there are systematic uncertainties of three types : those that depend on the energy of observation , the angle of observation , and the overall normalization .",
    "the uncertainty that depends on the energy of observation includes contributions from the electron - pion separation procedure , which were between 2% and 5% , together with contributions from estimates of the corrections for energy loss and multiple scattering in the target and in the mid - spectrometer wire chamber , and for effects of pion decay and muon contamination , which contributed an additional 5% .",
    "the uncertainty in the correction for energy loss and multiple scattering was estimated to be equal to one - half of the correction applied .",
    "the uncertainty in the corrections for pion decay and muon contamination was estimated to be one - half of the difference between the correction derived from the simulation described earlier , and that given by accounting only for the loss of pions by decay within the spectrometer .    an angle - dependent uncertainty ( see table i ) arises from possible misalignment between the axis of the target and that of the spectrometer , which will produce changes in both the thickness of the liquid @xmath0he seen by the beam and in the effective acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "these uncertainties were estimated together by comparison between the observed angular variation of the differential cross section for @xmath29 scattering and that predicted from interpolation of the known cross sections .",
    "normalization uncertainties are of two kinds ; those that are due to slowly varying changes in the response of the ionization chamber used to monitor the incident beam flux and the density of the @xmath0he target , and those that involve the determination of the absolute scale of the measured cross sections by normalization to @xmath54 scattering .",
    "variation in the ionization chamber response , due to changes in ambient temperature and pressure , was monitored by comparison with the primary proton beam monitor and a downstream scattering monitor  @xcite .",
    "since these variations were observed to occur on roughly the same time scale as did changes of spectrometer angle , they have been included with the angle - dependent uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty in the overall scale of the cross section contains contributions from uncertainties in the densities of the @xmath0he and ch targets and in the assumed @xmath29 scattering cross section .",
    "the uncertainties in the densities were determined  @xcite to be 0.7% and 0.6% for the @xmath0he and ch targets , respectively .",
    "an additional overall uncertainty of 2% is assumed to account for the accuracy of the phase shift prediction of the free @xmath29 cross section@xcite .",
    "combining these uncertainties with the uncertainty in the determination of each particle s position in the spectrometer focal plane ( 1% ) and in the determination of the spectrometer acceptance function ( 1% ) , yields an overall uncertainty of 2.4% , independent of incident beam energy and angle .",
    "( the uncertainties due to the determination of electronics deadtime , spectrometer dispersion , and wire chamber efficiency were insignificant compared to those listed above . )",
    "this uncertainty has been combined in quadrature with the angle - dependent uncertainties in table i to yield the final result in the last column for each incident beam .",
    "the doubly differential cross sections measured for the @xmath0he@xmath55 reaction at incident energies 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 , and 270 mev are presented as pion energy spectra in figs . 37 , respectively .",
    "the doubly differential cross sections measured for the @xmath0he@xmath56 reaction at incident energies of 180 and 240 mev are displayed in figs .  8 and 9 .",
    "the bars on the plotted points indicate the statistical uncertainty plus the systematic uncertainty in the pion - electron separation procedure and the corrections for pion decay , energy loss in the target cell , and multiple scattering in the inter - dipole wire chamber .",
    "the detection of a pion with charge opposite to that of the incident beam is not a unique signature of dcx at incident energies above about 170 mev , the threshold for the pion - induced pion production ( pipp ) reactions @xmath0he@xmath57 and @xmath0he@xmath58 .",
    "the magnitude and kinematic range of the contribution of pipp is severely limited by the phase space available to this reaction , however , and a significant effect is only possible at incident energies well above 200 mev .    to indicate the effect that this contribution might have on the shape of the dcx energy spectra , figs .",

    "the phase space predictions , whose normalization will be discussed later , are only presented as a guide .",
    "( the shapes of the energy spectra from pipp in deuterium@xcite were found to be very similar to phase space , but the measurement of grion _",
    "et al._@xcite of pipp in @xmath9o found significant deviation from such predictions . )      in earlier measurements , wood _ et al._@xcite found that a general feature of the doubly differential cross sections for inclusive dcx in @xmath9o and @xmath20ca was the similarity of the shapes of the energy spectra to simple predictions based on the available phase space in a dcx reaction leading to four bodies : a pion , two knocked - out nucleons , and residual nucleus .",
    "figure 10 compares the inclusive spectra from the @xmath0he and @xmath9o dcx reactions , measured at 25@xmath3 and incident energy 240 mev ; the different curves represent phase space energy distributions based on different numbers of particles in the final state .",
    "the phase space prediction for the @xmath9o data assumes four bodies in the final state , as mentioned above ; this curve has been normalized so that the phase space prediction integrated over the solid angle and energy of the outgoing pion yields the measured total dcx reaction cross section .",
    "the three predictions compared with the @xmath0he spectrum are similarly normalized to the total cross section predicted by a simple scaling law@xcite .",
    "the dashed curve is the result for a 5-body final state for the dcx reaction @xmath62 , which is in fact the ultimate final state .",
    "the solid and dot - dashed curves correspond to 4- and 3-body final states which might result if two or three of the nucleons in the final state recoil as as a `` cluster '' with no internal motion , i.e. , @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear that , unlike the case of @xmath9o , none of the distributions even approximately represents the data , nor provides any insight into the most striking feature of the doubly differential cross sections for dcx in @xmath0he , the large peak - like structure at high outgoing pion energy .      in order to gain more quantitative information about the shape of the energy spectra , especially the centroid energy and width of the high energy peak , a line shape constructed from a gaussian curve and a five - body phase space distribution was fitted to those spectra in which a peak was apparent .",
    "the centroid , width , and area of the gaussian were all allowed to vary in the fitting procedure , but only the magnitude of the phase space distribution was variable .",
    "the missing mass and four - nucleon excitation energy ( defined as the missing mass less the mass of the four free nucleons in the final state ) was extracted from this analysis .",
    "examination of the results ( see ref.@xcite ) clearly indicates that the peak does not correspond to a resonance in the four - nucleon system .",
    "there exists a systematic variation in the missing mass with scattering angle and incident energy which is well outside the uncertainty in its determination .",
    "varies from @xmath65 mev at incident energy 150 mev to @xmath66 mev at 270 mev ; and at incident energy 240 mev from @xmath67 mev at 25@xmath68 to @xmath69 mev at 130@xmath68 . ]",
    "the width of the peak varies less dramatically , but nonetheless sufficiently to contradict the four - nucleon resonance hypothesis .",
    "another hypothesis is that the peak results from quasi - free scattering of the pion with some sort of `` cluster '' within the nucleus .",
    "if the mass of the cluster remains unchanged by the scattering , there is no choice of mass which can describe the magnitude and angular variation of the peak energy , even at a single incident energy .",
    "if one allows the mass of the cluster to change , corresponding for example to the excitation of the cluster into a resonant state , it is possible to find a combination of initial mass and excitation energy which approximately describes the data at a given incident energy .",
    "it should be emphasized that a similar variation results if the scattering predominantly occurs on a certain number of nucleons , and energy is lost to each nucleon individually .",
    "the quasi - free kinematic analysis presented here is similar in this sense to earler rapidity analyses of inclusive energy spectra@xcite .",
    "@xcite presents the results of fitting the kinematic variation with two - body scattering formulae , assuming an initial cluster `` mass '' and a final `` mass '' found by adding an excitation energy to the initial mass .",
    "the initial masses are poorly constrained , but nevertheless show a large variation with incident energy , as do the excitation energies which are more accurately determined .",
    "an explanation of the high outgoing energy peak in terms of quasi - free scattering and excitation therefore seems unlikely .    in section vii.b a simple double scattering reaction model is considered ; the results suggest that this peak has a natural explanation in the dynamics of two forward angle @xmath70 reactions .      to the extent that coulomb effects may be neglected ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath4 are identical reactions in nuclei with equal numbers of protons and neutrons , assuming the invariance of the strong interaction with respect to rotations in isospin space .",
    "figures 11 and 12 compare a sample of the energy spectra for the two reactions .",
    "the error bars indicated in the figure do not include the uncertainty in the normalizations which are 6% and 7% for the 180 and 240 mev spectra , respectively . as can be seen ,",
    "the shapes and magnitudes of the spectra are quite similar .",
    "this near equality of the cross sections for these mirror processes can be understood by estimating the sizes of effects caused by the coulomb force@xcite .",
    "it is found that the distortion of the pion wave causes a shift of at most 6 mev in the @xmath7-nucleus interaction between the two reactions .",
    "the effect of the coulomb energy on the distribution of the nucleons in the @xmath0he ground state is estimated to produce a difference of about 1 mev between the neutron and proton distributions .",
    "the energy of the four - nucleon final state is affected more strongly by the coulomb potential ; the potential energy difference between four protons and four neutrons is approximately 12 mev .",
    "thus , reactions leading to states of four protons with minimum internal motion could be suppressed or their energy shifted relative to four - neutron states , because of the coulomb energy barrier . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of the first excited state of @xmath0he indicates the effective `` strength '' of the pauli principle to be about 20 mev .",
    "two nucleons must be excited out of initial @xmath71 eigenstates in @xmath0he by the dcx reaction , giving a total energy barrier of approximately 40 mev for a four - like - nucleon `` ground state . ''",
    "since the pauli principle applies to both four - proton and four - neutron final states , the coulomb potential energy difference therefore appears to be less significant , though not negligible , in comparison with the effect of the pauli principle .",
    "it should be noted that coulomb effects are expected to be sizable only at the highest outgoing pion energies , which correspond to little energy left in the residual system of four nucleons .",
    "figure 13 compares the doubly differential cross sections for the reactions @xmath5he@xmath4 and @xmath0he@xmath4 measured at 50@xmath3 and 240 mev incident energy .",
    "the shapes of the energy spectra are strikingly similar .",
    "the magnitude of the dcx cross sections in @xmath5he is slightly larger than in @xmath0he , and the peak is at a somewhat higher outgoing pion energy .",
    "the latter difference between the two spectra may arise simply from the difference in binding energies of the nuclei , since the dcx reaction leads to complete disintegration of the nucleus in both cases .",
    "the difference in the magnitude of the differential cross sections may result from the different strengths of the competing reactions of quasi - free scattering and pion absorption .",
    "recalling that negative pions interact more strongly with neutrons ( in the @xmath8 resonance region ) , the competition from quasi - free scattering in @xmath0he should be twice as large as in @xmath5he .",
    "likewise , if one considers pion absorption to proceed through a  quasi - deuteron \" mechanism , twice as many @xmath72 pairs are found in @xmath0he as in @xmath5he .",
    "indeed , recent measurements of pion absorption cross sections in @xmath5he and @xmath0he @xcite show the latter cross section to be approximately twice the former , in the @xmath8 resonance region .",
    "thus , the absorption process is expected to compete more strongly with dcx in @xmath0he .",
    "however , the dcx reactions should also be sensitive to the density of the nucleus .",
    "one expects double scattering to be enhanced if the average internucleon distance is smaller in one case compared to another , suggesting a larger dcx reaction cross section in @xmath0he than in @xmath5he .",
    "thus , it is not obvious how large a difference , if any , should be expected between the magnitudes of the dcx cross sections , without a more quantitative investigation of the problem .      of the previous experiments@xcite which have investigated the dcx reaction in @xmath0he in the energy region of the present experiment , only one@xcite affords the possibility of comparison with the present results for the doubly differential cross sections .",
    "two experiments@xcite were searches for tetraneutron bound states , performed for a limited range of incident and outgoing pion energies at a scattering angle of 0@xmath3 .",

    "the comparison of the stetz data at 200 mev with the present data at 180 and 240 mev ( figs . 5 and 6 ) reveals a disagreement in both magnitude and shape .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not known , although some possible causes are suggested in ref .",

    "the dcx cross section does not exhibit a resonance shape near the energy of the @xmath8 resonance , in contrast to other pion - nucleus reactions .",
    "this can be understood as a simple consequence of double scattering , if on average the pion loses substantial energy in its first interaction . as the incident pion energy moves through the @xmath8 resonance ,",
    "the energy of the second collision is still below resonance , whereas at incident energies 10100 mev higher than the @xmath8 resonance , the energy of the second collision is just passing through the @xmath8 region .",
    "the effect is to broaden the resonance and shift its maximum to higher energy .",

    "below 200 mev incident pion energy , the calculation lies 1030% higher than the measured cross sections , whereas it begins to fall below them at higher incident energies .",
    "some of this discrepancy at higher energy may be the result of the contributions to the measured cross section from pion - induced pion production , as suggested in the figure , but the theoretical prediction appears nonetheless to be low .",

    "what distinguishes this calculation from simpler folding models is the non - static treatment of the @xmath6 interaction and the inclusion ( albeit approximate ) of the binding of the nucleons .    in the energy region of the @xmath8 resonance ,",
    "the interaction between the pion and the nucleon varies strongly with pion - nucleon relative energy . because of the the fermi motion of the bound nucleon , the treatment of the interaction within the nuclear medium is a critical part of any calculation of pion - nucleon scattering . in particular , one wishes to account for the variation in interaction energy due to simple kinematics and the mean nuclear potential , both of which are well known . following the treatment by lenz@xcite ,",
    "we replace the in - medium @xmath85-matrix by the free @xmath6 @xmath85-matrix evaluated at an effective relative energy : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the nuclear hamiltonian with the dependence on the @xmath86th nucleon separated out , @xmath90 is the center - of - mass kinetic energy of the system formed by the @xmath86th nucleon and the incident pion , and @xmath91 is the mean nuclear ( shell - model ) potential felt by the @xmath86th nucleon . as discussed in ref .",

    "three choices of @xmath93 were investigated , -55 mev , 0 mev , and -37 mev , corresponding to values of @xmath94 in the nuclear interior , the surface , and the wavefunction - averaged value @xmath95 , in which harmonic oscillator functions fitted to the elastic charge form factor were used . to avoid this approximation , a full @xmath8-hole calculation",
    "@xcite would be necessary , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "proper treatment of the off - shell momentum dependence requires a model of the @xmath6 interaction ; typically , the off - shell effects are described with form factors which are functions of the relative momentum , and the individual @xmath6 partial waves are treated separately@xcite . in this work",

    "is found using a wigner transformation  @xcite and taking the classical limit @xmath96 . selecting the specific amplitude for scattering from nucleon 1 to nucleon 2 , as is shown in fig .",
    "17 , we may write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the energy of nucleon 1 .",

    "several further simplifications have been made . within a distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia )",

    ", the sum over intermediate nuclear states is restricted to a single state .",
    "the further approximation is made of describing the initial state nucleus with the shell model ; since the final state of @xmath0he after dcx is four free nucleons , the shell model may not be an apt description .",
    "however , to do better one would need to solve the four - body nuclear hamiltonian exactly .",
    "finally , an enormous calculational simplification is gained by replacing all of the distorted wave continuum states ( nucleon and pion ) with plane waves .",
    "the general result can be further simplified by considering its application to the specific case of @xmath0he .",
    "since the final nuclear states will involve large excitation energies , the effect of the overall antisymmetrization of the four - nucleon states is presumed small , except for the lowest nucleon energies . by requiring that the momentum of the struck nucleon lie outside the fermi surface of the ground state , one effectively includes pauli blocking of the low energy nucleons , which is the major effect of the antisymmetrization .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0he is assumed then to be described by the product of four ( @xmath100 ) harmonic oscillator wavefunctions .    in the calculation of the inclusive cross section ,",

    "the value @xmath103 = 1.36 fm was determined from low momentum transfer electron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the free transition matrix element used in the present calculation was derived from the free @xmath6 cross section predicted by arndt  @xcite , which is an empirical energy - dependent phase - shift representation of the cross sections .",

    "the shape and magnitude of the prediction are evidently sensitive to the choice of potential for each scattering ; the critical nature of the @xmath6 @xmath85-matrix energy prescription is therefore underscored .",
    "this sensitivity is further illustrated by the double - dot - dashed curve , which assumes the nucleons to be at rest when calculating the interaction energy ( static prescription ) , and @xmath106 .",
    "the static prescription fails to reproduce the low - energy shape of the spectrum , but the position of the high - energy peak agrees relatively well with the data .",

    "calculated cross sections are shown for three choices of the potentials @xmath112 . in each case",
    "the theoretical predictions has been renormalized to yield the same integrated area as that of the measured energy spectra .",
    "the inclusion of a non - zero potential appears to be important to determining the correct shape in most of the spectra .",
    "the comparisons shown in fig .",
    "20 disguise the fact that the calculation is not able to reproduce the incident energy dependence of the magnitude of the cross section  see fig .",
    "only the prediction with @xmath106 has an energy dependence at all similar to that of the data .",
    "the inclusion of distortion of the pion waves is expected to cause a large reduction in the cross section , especially below the energy of the @xmath8 resonance where pion absorption is an important channel , along with quasi - free scattering .",
    "the qualitative and semi - quantitative success of the calculation described above in reproducing the data indicates that nucleon motion and nuclear binding effects are important , although these effects were included in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ fashion .",
    "ideally , the calculation should include a proper treatment of the initial nucleon motion and nucleon recoil , along with use of relativistic pion and nucleon kinematics , a full integration over the intermediate pion momentum , and incorporation of nuclear binding by means of a model which would also fix the energy arguments of the @xmath6 @xmath85-matrix elements .",
    "progress toward these goals was made by kulkarni@xcite , who developed a relativistic three - body model of pion - nuclear interactions ",
    "the three bodies being the pion , the @xmath114 nucleon , and the residual nucleus or `` core ''  in order to take account of medium modifications of @xmath6 interactions .",
    "he has calculated doubly differential cross sections for dcx based on the sscx mechanism , with the @xmath115-matrix elements for the first scattering obtained from the three - body model .",
    "an attractive square well potential is used to model the interaction between the @xmath6 composite and the core .",
    "the energy arguments of the @xmath85-matrix elements entering the approximate expression for the @xmath115-matrix elements are fixed by means of this prescription , which reduces to the prescription of garcilazo and gibbs@xcite in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "various investigations were performed@xcite : cross sections were calculated with and without the medium - dependent terms , with different widths of the the initial gaussian nuclear wave function , and with only @xmath116-waves and only @xmath117-waves in the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "the relative contributions of non - spin flip , single- and double - spin - flip processes to the cross section were calculated .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the inclusion of medium - dependent terms was seen to have only a small effect on the cross section .",
    "the double - peaking in the forward - angle cross sections was confirmed to arise from the @xmath117-wave component of the @xmath6 interaction , as expected from previous work@xcite .",
    "reference@xcite contains comparisons of the relativistic three - body model calculation with a large number of the cross sections measured in the present experiment . in general",
    ", the agreement is poor , with the exception of the case at 120 mev , where the theory reproduces both the shape and magnitude of the measurements . a typical result of this calculation is shown in fig .",
    "22 , which can be compared with fig . 19 .",
    "although this calculation produces double peaks at forward angles , they do not resemble those seen in the data , and the disagreeement with the large - angle cross sections becomes even greater than that seen in fig .",
    "alqadi and gibbs@xcite have calculated doubly differential cross sections for @xmath0he(@xmath78 ) using an intranuclear cascade ( inc ) code .",
    "pions are allowed to propagate classically through the nucleus and interact with the nucleons via absorption , elastic scattering , charge exchange , or pion production processes as permitted by energy and charge conservation , with the relative interaction probabilities given by the ratio of the relevant cross sections to the total cross section .",
    "the effects of pauli blocking and final state interactions are taken into account .",
    "comparisons of the calculations with the present data at 240 and 270 mev are shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the results will be summarized here .",
    "when only two nucleons ( neutrons ) are allowed to be active in the inc , the resulting @xmath55 cross section is found to be very similar to that obtained using the two - nucleon sscx model discussed in sect .",
    "\\2 . allowing all four nucleons to be active in the inc",
    "reduces the cross section by a factor of @xmath1182 , in better agreement with the data . the two protons , with their large cross section for elastic scattering of positive pions , effectively `` shield '' the neutrons from the incoming pions and",
    "thus reduce the probability of their initiating of a dcx reaction .",
    "final state interactions , as in the two - nucleon model , mainly affect the cross section for outgoing pions at forward angles and high energies .",
    "\\4 . at 180 and 240 mev ,",
    "as one goes from forward to backward angles , the calculation goes from being slightly lower than the measured cross section ( at 25@xmath68 and 50@xmath68 ) to being slightly larger ( at 105@xmath68 ) to being as much as a factor of two larger ( at 130@xmath68 ) .",
    "this angular dependence , though not as severe here , is reminiscent of that found in the non - static sscx calculations described above .",
    "\\5 . at 240 and 270 mev , the calculation with pion production `` turned off '' does not exhibit a double - peaked structure ; the low - energy peak is absent .",
    "inclusion of pion production adds strength to the low pion energy region , as expected , so that the resulting theoretical cross section is double - peaked , in fair agreement with the data at 25@xmath68 and 50@xmath68 .",
    "the calculation is unable to reproduce the double - peaked structure seen at 25@xmath68 and 50@xmath68 for incident energy 180 mev .",
    "the low - energy peak in this case can not be attributed to pion production .",
    "the results of an experimental investigation of the pion double charge exchange ( dcx ) reaction in @xmath0he at intermediate incident energies have been presented .",
    "study of the reaction is motivated by interest in understanding the reaction of pions with the nucleus , particularly the role of multiple scattering in such reactions .",
    "pion double charge exchange is an ideal probe of such processes because two nucleons must be involved in the reaction in order to conserve charge .",
    "moreover , the intimate connection of the pion to the nuclear potential at long range makes an understanding of pion - nucleus reactions important to all attempts to investigate the structure and dynamics of the nucleus .",
    "the measurements presented here constitute the first systematic investigation of the dcx reaction in @xmath0he for a broad range of incident pion energies and outgoing pion angles .",
    "the doubly differential cross sections for the inclusive reaction @xmath0he@xmath119 have been measured at five incident pion energies in the range 120270 mev , and for the reaction @xmath0he@xmath120 at 180 and 240 mev . at each incident energy , the cross sections were measured at from three to five angles between 25@xmath3 and 130@xmath3 , over the entire energy range of the outgoing pions above 10 mev . the ability to detect low energy pions was particularly important in view of the large fraction of the yield which results from reactions leading to pions with energies below 50 mev .",
    "the doubly differential cross sections have been integrated to obtain both angular distributions and total reaction cross sections",
    ".    an interesting feature of the dcx energy spectra measured at forward angles is a prominent peak at high outgoing pion energy , which changes in magnitude and energy as the scattering angle is increased ; this feature was apparent in the spectra from both @xmath0he@xmath1 and @xmath0he@xmath2 reactions .",
    "empirical analysis of the peak indicates that it does not arise from a resonant state of four nucleons or from a reaction with a  cluster \" in the nucleus .",
    "the structure had not been observed in earlier measurements , primarily owing to the incomplete survey of the reactions carried out .",
    "the results of several calculations of the dcx cross sections based on the sequential single charge exchange model of the reaction are presented .",
    "although calculations employing the fixed - nucleon approximation@xcite do not reproduce the data , a non - static sscx calculation is able to account for many features of the measurements . in this model@xcite ,",
    "the high energy peak is a manifestation of the basic @xmath117-wave character of the @xmath6 interaction near the energy of the @xmath8 resonance . because forward and backward scattering are preferred relative to scattering at intermediate angles , forward double scattering consists mostly of two forward or two backward reactions .",
    "the energy losses of the pions in the two cases are quite different , however , and lead to high- and low - energy components of the outgoing pion spectrum at forward angles . in this calculation ,",
    "all continuum states are treated as plane waves and precise agreement of the absolute magnitude of the theoretical predictions with the measured cross sections is therefore not expected .",
    "the shapes of the predicted energy spectra may be more meaningful .",
    "in particular , to reproduce the shape of the measured spectra , it was found to be important to treat the @xmath6 interaction non - statically so as to include the fermi motion of the nucleons in the determination of the relative energy of the @xmath6 system .",
    "sensitivity to the inclusion of the nuclear binding potential was also found .",
    "an attempt@xcite to remove some of the approximations in the above - mentioned calculation , by use of a relativistic three - body model of @xmath7-nuclear interactions , did not result in improved agreement with the data .",
    "a recent intranuclear cascade calculation@xcite , with the inclusion of the pion - induced pion production ( pipp ) process , provides good agreement with some of the data at 240 and 270 mev . without pipp , the peak at low pion energies in the forward - angle data is missing",
    "however , pipp can not be responsible for the low - energy forward - angle peaks seen at 180 mev or at 150 mev ( well below threshold ) .",
    "we note that in the @xmath5he(@xmath121 ) reaction@xcite , forward angle double peaks were seen at all incident energies at which measurements were made : 240 , 180 , and 120 mev .    in summary ,",
    "the calculations presented here are seen to reproduce some features of the measured cross sections .",
    "however , a more complete theoretical treatment is evidently required to account for the shapes , magnitudes , and incident pion energy dependence of the doubly differential , singly differential , and total reaction cross sections for inclusive dcx in @xmath0he .",
