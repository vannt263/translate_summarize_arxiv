    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most interesting possibilities offered by quantum field theory whose relevance to nature has not yet been established  @xcite . in addition to relating fermions to bosons , stabilizing the mass scale of the weak interactions and ( if r - parity is conserved ) providing a plausible candidate for cosmological dark matter ( dm ) , supersymmetry also provides a framework for the unification of particle physics and gravity .",
    "the latter is governed by the planck scale , @xmath4 gev , which is close to the energy where the gravitational interactions may become comparable in magnitude to the gauge interactions .",
    "if supersymmetry is to be combined with gravity , it must be a local symmetry , and the resulting theory is called supergravity ( sugra )  @xcite . in models of spontaneously - broken supergravity",
    ", the spin-3/2 superpartner of the graviton , namely the gravitino @xmath5 , acquires a mass @xmath6 by absorbing the goldstino fermion of spontaneously - broken supersymmetry via a super - higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the gravitino is a very plausible candidate for the dm , since the presence of a massive gravitino is an inevitable prediction of sugra .",
    "moreover , in models of gauge - mediated susy breaking  @xcite the gravitino is necessarily the lsp .",
    "furthermore , there are also generic regions of the parameter space of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) models where the gravitino is the lsp .    in msugra the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters",
    "take a particularly simple form at the planck scale @xcite , in which the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses - squared @xmath7 , gaugino masses @xmath8 and trilinear parameters @xmath9 are each flavor diagonal and universal @xcite .",
    "renormalization - group evolution ( rge ) is then used to derive the effective values of the supersymmetric parameters at the low - energy ( electroweak ) scale .",
    "five parameters fixed at the gauge coupling unification scale , @xmath10 , the gaugino mass @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the sign of @xmath13 are then related to the mass parameters at the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking by the rge .",
    "moreover , msugra requires that the gravitino mass @xmath14 at the planck scale , and imposes a relation between trilinear and bilinear soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters that may be used to fix @xmath15 in terms of the other msugra parameters .",
    "the msugra parameter space offers both neutralino dark matter and gravitino dark matter as generic possibilities .    in general , it would be difficult to detect gravitino dm directly , since the gravitino s couplings are suppressed by inverse powers of the planck scale .",
    "however , evidence for gravitino dm may be obtained indirectly in collider experiments , since in such a case the next - to - lightest sparticle ( nlsp ) has a long lifetime , as it decays into the gravitino through very weak interactions suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "one of the most plausible candidates for the nlsp is the lighter scalar superpartner of the tau lepton , called the stau , @xmath16 .",
    "if universal supersymmetry - breaking soft supersymmetry - breaking masses for squarks and sleptons are assumed , as in msugra , renormalization effects and mixing between the spartners of the left- and right - handed sleptons cause the @xmath17 to become the nlsp .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , sparticles must be pair - produced at colliders with sufficiently high energies , and heavier sparticles will decay into other sparticles , until the decay cascade terminates with the nlsp , which is metastable in gravitino dm scenarios based on msugra and decays only long after being produced .",
    "collider experiments offer possibilities to detect and measure metastable nlsps such as the staus in msugra , and to use their decays to study indirectly the properties of gravitinos , which can not be observed directly in astrophysical experiments .",
    "there are several experimental constraints on the msugra parameter space : the lsp must be electrically and colour - neutral , and one must satisfy the limit from lep  2 on the stau mass : @xmath18 gev obtained from the pair production of staus , as well as limits on other sparticles , the mass of the lightest higgs scalar , the dm density , the branching ratio for radiative _ b _ decay and the muon anomalous magnetic moment . an up - to - date compilation of these experimental and phenomenological constraints on the msugra model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "astrophysics and cosmology also constrain the properties of metastable particles such as the staus in gravitino dm scenarios  @xcite , in particular via the comparison between the calculated and observed abundances of light elements , assuming the cosmological baryon density derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "in addition to the hadronic and electromagnetic effects due to secondary particles produced in the showers induced by stau decay , one must also consider the catalysis effects of stau bound states  @xcite .",
    "in certain regions of msugra parameter space , these may even bring the calculations of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) into better agreement with the observed abundances of @xmath1li  @xcite .",
    "a number of benchmark scenarios in which the stau decay showers do not destroy the successful results of bbn were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "these did not take bound - state effects into account , but these may be included in related models , as we discuss later .",
    "the phenomenology of stau nlsps in both proton - proton and @xmath0 colliders has been considered in a number of previous papers . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the stau mass could be measured quite accurately by the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc , using their tracking systems and time - of - flight ( tof ) information from resistive plate chamber ( rpcs ) .",
    "previous studies show that the polarization of @xmath19 lepton could be measured via the energy distribution of the decay products of the polarized @xmath19 lepton at future lepton colliders  @xcite .",
    "there have also been some phenomenological investigations of long - lived staus at the ilc  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the pair production of staus in @xmath0 annihilation at the future linear colliders ilc  @xcite and clic  @xcite , assuming that the lsp is the gravitino and the nlsp is the lighter stau .",
    "in addition to the three benchmark scenarios proposed earlier , we also propose a new benchmark scenario chosen to improve the agreement of big - bang nucleosynthesis calculations with the observed @xmath1li abundances after bound - state catalysis effects are included .",
    "this point has a relatively heavy stau that could only be observed at clic . following a general discussion of the signatures and detection of staus in the linear - collider environment",
    ", we explore the possible measurements of model parameters such as the stau mixing angle that could be made at the ilc or clic .",
    "we show that beam polarization and/or a measurement of the final - state @xmath19 polarization would be very useful in this respect .",
    "we also discuss the choice of the center - of - mass energy that would maximize the cross section for producing slow - moving staus with @xmath2 , that would be trapped in a typical linear - collider detector .",
    "the subsequent stau decays would be optimal for some measurements of gravitino parameters .",
    "we show that most such slow - moving staus are produced in the cascade decays of heavier sparticles , so that the optimal center - of - mass energies for trapping staus are typically considerably higher than the stau pair - production threshold .",
    "in the msugra framework used here , @xmath20 is the supersymmetric higgs(ino ) mass parameter , we denote by @xmath10 the universal soft susy - breaking contribution to the masses of all scalars ( including the higgs fields ) , @xmath8 is the universal susy - breaking gaugino mass , and @xmath11 is the universal susy - breaking factor in the soft trilinear scalar interactions . in addition , there is a bilinear soft susy - breaking parameter @xmath21 , which appears in the effective higgs potential , and is related by msugra to the trilinear parameter : @xmath22 .",
    "all these soft susy - breaking parameters are defined at the scale of grand unification . in general studies of the mssm , @xmath15 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets at the weak scale ,",
    "is taken as a free parameter . however , in msugra it is determined dynamically once the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath21 is imposed .",
    "this parameter set also determines the gravitino mass , since @xmath14 in msugra , as well as the other sparticle masses . for calculations of sparticle mass spectra and other properties in the models we study here , we use the updated isasugra programme , which is part of the isajet package  @xcite .",
    "this programme is convenient for event generation with pythia  @xcite for various colliders .    a selection of benchmark msugra points consistent with present data from particle physics and bbn constraints on the decays of metastable nlsps was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we use a subset of these benchmark scenarios to study msugra phenomenology at @xmath23 colliders , namely the points denoted @xmath24 , in which the nlsp is the lighter stau , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath25 lifetime in these models ranges from @xmath26  s to @xmath27  s , so fast - moving charged nlsps would be indistinguishable from massive stable particles , in a generic collider detector . however , it might be possible to observe the decays into gravitinos of any slow - moving @xmath25s that lose sufficient energy to stop in the detector .",
    "the msugra benchmark scenarios were formulated assuming the representative value @xmath28 found in the simplest polonyi model of supersymmetry breaking in msugra  @xcite .",
    "the allowed region of the gravitino dm parameter space may be displayed in the @xmath29 plane , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the polonyi value of @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical and phenomenological constraints are displayed , together with the astrophysical constraints on nlsp decays .",
    "the combined effect of these constraints is to allow a wedge in the @xmath29 plane at relatively low values of @xmath30 .",
    "the benchmark point @xmath31 was chosen near the apex of this wedge , whereas the points @xmath32 and @xmath33 were chosen at larger values of @xmath8 , and hence more challenging for the lhc and other colliders  @xcite .",

    "[ table1 ] _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     concerning the point @xmath40 , the angular distributions of the staus and right - handed selectrons produced directly are given in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the staus peak around the central part of the distribution for their pair production while selectrons place forward direction for the @xmath42 production due to the contribution from the neutralino exchange in the @xmath43channel . if one study only the direct production of staus it is useful to apply a cut on the angular distribution @xmath44 for an easy identification of staus . in this case",
    "the direct signal cross section reduces @xmath45 and the contribution from indirect production can be eliminated mostly .",
    "the right - handed smuons show the same angular distribution as the staus for their pair production . at this point , in order to be sure that stau is still an nlsp we need to have experimental identification of the corresponding final states . assuming the stau is an nlsp we expect hadronic decay channels of tau leptons and the missing energy , otherwise smuons give their unique signatures in the muon spectrometer when they stopped inside the detector .",
    "however , here we take the stau as an nlsp with a good motivation from the bbn implications .",
    "we show in fig . @xmath46",
    "all the contributions to the stau pairs from the indirect production mechanisms for the corresponding benchmark points .",
    "in addition , our interest here is in the contributions of these heavier sparticles to the total yields of slow - moving staus with @xmath2 , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . comparing these yields with those produced by direct pair - production alone , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we see that they are greatly enhanced .",
    "it is also apparent that the optimal center - of - mass energies are substantially higher , reflecting the higher thresholds for pair - producing heavier sparticles .",
    "specifically , we find optimal center - of - mass energies of 430 , 1200 , 1150 and 2800  gev for the benchmark points @xmath47 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the last column of table  [ table5 ] displays the maximal number of slow - moving and hence stoppable staus that might be obtainable at these optimal center - of - mass energies in the four benchmark scenarios .",
    "these numbers provide greatly improved prospects for observing stau decays into gravitinos .",
    "this would yield direct insight into the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , via a measurement of the stau lifetime , and possibly of the gravitino mass , via the kinematics of stau decays .",
    "[ fig11]_,width=377,height=302 ]",
    "we have discussed in this paper how the study of a metastable stau nlsp could be optimized at a linear collider such as the ilc or clic . the stau production rate , particularly using a polarized @xmath48 beam ,",
    "would provide information on the handedness of the stau , as well as its mass .",
    "the center - of - mass energy could then be optimized for the combined direct and indirect production of slow - moving staus that would stop in the detector .",
    "their decays could provide valuable information , not only on the stau lifetime and on the mass of the gravitino , but also supplementary information on the handedness of the stau via a measurement of the polarization of the tau decay products .",
    "the following are possible scenarios for studying metastable stau scenarios at the lhc and a subsequent linear collider .",
    "if there is a metastable stau weighing up to @xmath49  gev , as in benchmarks @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the lhc has been shown able to produce and detect them , and also to analyze the msugra models in which they appear  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it should be possible to measure the stau mass with an accuracy of @xmath50  % .",
    "however , most of the lhc staus would be produced with @xmath51 , and would decay outside the detector if they have lifetimes @xmath52  s. we recall that there are no significant cosmological constraints on such staus if their lifetimes @xmath53  s , and that there are only weak constraints on staus with lifetimes @xmath54  s. therefore , collider information on the stau lifetime would be interesting for cosmology as well as the theory of supersymmetry breaking",
    ". however , the numbers of slow staus that stop inside the lhc detectors would be relatively modest : perhaps just a handful in benchmarks @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and somewhat more in benchmark @xmath31 . the lhc would detect no staus in the case of benchmark @xmath40 .    if the stau is indeed found by the lhc , in these scenarios one would know the optimal energy for producing the optimal number of stopping staus via the reaction @xmath55 . as we have emphasized in this paper , there would in general be many additional staus coming from the decays of heavier sparticles produced by reactions such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , etc .. the masses of these heavier sparticles could also be measured at the lhc in models resembling benchmarks @xmath58 and @xmath33 , and hence the corresponding @xmath23 thresholds could be estimated .",
    "these production mechanisms would also yield slow staus that should be included in the choice of the @xmath23 center - of - mass energy in order to maximize the number of stopped staus .",
    "alternatively , the stau might be too heavy to be produced at the lhc , as in benchmark scenario @xmath40 which , we recall , has the added merit of being @xmath1li - friendly . in such a case , one would need to measure the stau mass in @xmath23 annihilation itself before going to the optimal energy for stopping staus .",
    "this would be depend on the masses of heavier sparticles , which could be determined either directly or by invoking some model .",
    "the signature for a stopped stau would be its decay @xmath59 out of coincidence with a collision in the central detector  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 decay modes ( and their branching ratios ) observable in the collider detector would be the leptonic 3-body decays @xmath60 ( 17.4% ) and @xmath61 ( 17.8% ) , and hadronic decays @xmath62 ( 11.1% ) , @xmath63 ( 25.4% ) and @xmath64 ( 19.4% ) . in the benchmark scenarios considered here",
    ", the decaying @xmath19s would be very energetic , since @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "these @xmath19 decays are therefore likely to produce isolated , high - energy hadronic or electromagnetic clusters above the threshold of the hcal ( @xmath66 gev ) , hadronic showers in the yoke ( @xmath67 gev ) , or energetic @xmath20s originating in the hcal or yoke ( @xmath68 gev )  @xcite .",
    "the main background would come from cosmic rays , and some rejection could be obtained by excluding decay vertices in the outermost detector layers and vetoing signals initiated by external muons . as pointed out in  @xcite , further excellent background discrimination would be provided by requiring the decay vertex to be consistent with the estimated stopping point of a @xmath69 detected and measured previously .",
    "the @xmath19 recoil energy @xmath70 would have sensitivity to the gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "we note in addition that the tau decay spectra measurable in each of the above decay channels would be sensitive to the tau polarization and hence the handedness of the parent stau .",
    "this analysis demonstrates once again the complementarity of the lhc and a linear electron - positron collider of sufficiently high energy .",
    "information from the lhc may not only establish the threshold for new physics , but also provide an estimate of the optimal energy for studying it .",
    "at least for certain studies , such as the decays of stopped staus considered here , this optimal energy may be significantly higher than the @xmath23 production threshold .",
