    "given a positive integer @xmath1 , a global field @xmath2 containing all @xmath3th roots of unity , and an irreducible , reduced root system @xmath4 of rank @xmath5 , weyl group multiple dirichlet series are dirichlet series in @xmath5 complex variables , with analytic continuation to @xmath6 and a group of functional equations isomorphic to the weyl group of @xmath4 .",
    "such series have applications in analytic number theory and arise , for example , in the study of moments of @xmath7-functions @xcite .",
    "we will be concerned with a class of weyl group multiple dirichlet series that arise as fourier - whittaker coefficients of metaplectic eisenstein series ( eisenstein series on covers of reductive groups ) . because the coefficients involve gauss sums , in general , such series are _ not _ eulerian .",
    "however , they do satisfy a twisted analogue of an euler product :  each prime @xmath0 of @xmath2 corresponds to a local factor , and like classical euler factors , the local @xmath0-parts are generating functions for the @xmath0-power coefficients of the series .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-parts completely determine the global series .    due to the complexity inherent in computing on metaplectic groups",
    ", significant effort has been devoted to the combinatorial problem of how to define @xmath0-parts in a way such that the resulting series coincide with those coming from eisenstein series . at present",
    ", there are two main approaches for which the resulting series have been shown to yield the desired analytic properties of meromorphic continuation and weyl group of functional equations .",
    "the first of brubaker , bump , and friedberg defines the @xmath0-parts term by term via gelfand - tsetlin patterns , crystal graphs , or related combinatorial devices .",
    "this approach produces the desired analytic properties for all @xmath4 when @xmath1 is sufficiently large @xcite , for all @xmath1 when @xmath8 @xcite , and in various other cases for classical types , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the second of chinta and gunnells defines the @xmath0-parts all at once with an averaging technique analogous to the weyl character formula .",
    "this approach produces a global object with the desired analytic properties for all @xmath4 and all @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the structure of @xmath0-parts of weyl group multiple dirichlet series defined using the chinta  gunnells technique @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to show that the methods of @xcite and @xcite give rise to the same series , in the situation where both are applicable . for @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the result follows from tokuyama s formula @xcite , which expresses a deformation of a weyl character as a sum over a crystal graph . for @xmath8 and general @xmath1 , the result follows from the the combined works of chinta and offen @xcite and mcnamara @xcite , who compare the two methods via local whittaker functions . for @xmath4 simply laced and @xmath10 , chinta , friedberg , and gunnells @xcite provide further evidence by showing that the stable ( see section [ sec : stable ] ) coefficients of the local @xmath0-parts agree .",
    "we extend the results of @xcite to all @xmath4 and @xmath1 .    our main tool to understand the structure of the @xmath0-parts is an explicit set of recurrence relations on the coefficients , which we state in theorem [ thm : rec ] .",
    "these relations allow us to prove theorem [ thm : support ] , which extends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) on the support of the @xmath0-parts to all @xmath4 and all @xmath1 . with theorem [ thm : support ]",
    ", we compare the stable coefficients of @xcite and @xcite ; theorem [ thm : stable ] extends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) and shows they do indeed agree .",
    "finally , theorem [ thm : unstab ] addresses the extent to which the recurrence relations uniquely determine the @xmath0-parts .",
    "in addition to analyzing the @xmath0-parts , we explore the structure of modified @xmath0-parts ( obtained by multiplying the @xmath0-parts with a rational factor ) that have applications to the case when @xmath2 is a function field over a finite field .",
    "when @xmath2 is the rational function field , up to a variable change the modified @xmath0-parts coincide with the global weyl group multiple dirichlet series .",
    "this phenomenon was first noticed in @xcite and mirrors the similarity between the zeta function of the rational function field and its euler factors . as a complement to theorem [ thm : support ] , theorem",
    "[ thm : gap ] describes the support of these modified @xmath0-parts . just as in the case of the zeta function of a function field",
    ", we expect the associated multiple dirichlet series to encode much information about the arithmetic of the defining curve .",
    "the first step is to understand the support of the series , which author will pursue in a forthcoming paper .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prelims ] , we review the chinta  gunnells construction of the @xmath0-parts @xcite . in section [ sec : rec ] , we derive an explicit set of recurrence relations on the coefficients of the @xmath0-parts , allowing us to prove theorem [ thm : support ] on the support of the @xmath0-parts . at the end of section [ sec : rec ]",
