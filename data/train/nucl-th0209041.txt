    "the quantum field theory , introduced to solve the many - body problems since the late fifties , has proved to be highly successful in studying the ground state , the equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties at finite temperatures@xcite . these theories to solve many - body problems are based on the conjecture that all of the effects of the medium at finite temperatures and densities would change the propagators of particles .",
