    "the primary division is made based on the mass of the secondary star in the binary , with systems for which @xmath4 being classified as low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , 1 @xmath5 classified as intermediate mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) and those with secondary masses greater than 10 m@xmath6 classified as high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "approximately 300 x - ray binary systems have been detected in the galaxy , with more than half of these being lmxbs .",

    "x - ray outbursts in these systems typically occur during periastron passage of the neutron star close to the circumstellar excretion disc of the be - star , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray outbursts have been observed to occur in two distinct flavors , ( i ) type - i : regular outbursts which occur during periastron passage , generally repeating on the binary orbital period , and ( ii ) type - ii : also known as giant outbursts likely arising from a dramatic expansion of the circumstellar disc . in contrast to type - i outbursts , type - ii outbursts do not have a strict phase dependence and typically last much longer than type - i bursts , with the outburst time typically being measured in months , e.g. see fig .",

    "cyclotron absorption lines have been detected in the x - ray spectra of a number of be / x - ray binaries allowing accurate constraints to be placed on the neutron star magnetic field . typically , magnetic flux densities in the range @xmath8 are measured , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of studying the effect of the neutron star b - field on the accretion flow . in these hmxbs",
    "the magnetic field is much larger than the b - field of the neutron stars in the much older population of neutron star lmxbs , e.g. , a magnetic flux density of @xmath9 has been measured in the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite .",

    "the main similarities are as follows ( i ) similar spectral branches in the cd / hid as those observed in lmxbs , ( ii ) smooth motion through the cd / hid , ( iii ) larger variability at low intensities , ( iv ) power spectra that can be described by a small number of lorentzians , and ( v ) flat topped noise at lower frequencies in the horizontal branch that turns into power - law noise in the diagonal branch .",
    "a number of differences were also observed , namely ( i ) different patterns in the cd / hid , e.g. a low intensity soft state , ( ii ) slower motion through the various patterns ( weeks / months as opposed to hrs / days in lmxbs ) , ( iii ) characteristic timescales that are an order of magnitude longer , and ( iv ) no apparent correlation between the power spectral parameters ( qpos , rms ) and the mass accretion rate .",
    "a number of features also hint at a b - field dependence of the timing properties , e.g. power - law noise in the hb branch in v0332 + 53 but flat topped noise in 4u0115 + 63 and exo 2030 + 375 whose b - fields are 2 - 3x lower than that of v0332 + 53 .",
    "these observations demonstrate that the accretion flow in the be / x - ray binaries is fundamentally similar to that in the more thoroughly studied lmxbs .",
    "simultaneous observations at optical / nir and x - ray wavelengths have shown substantial changes in the structure of both the accretion and circumstellar discs , with both discs observed to disappear at times .",

    "no significant change is observed in the position of the cyclotron lines ; however , as the background dominates above 60 kev , our limited ability to constrain the continuum above the cyclotron line will affect our ability to quantify any small changes that may be present . the simple cut - off power - law model that we have used to describe the high energy emission provides a good description of the data .",
