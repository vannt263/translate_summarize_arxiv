    "recoil in the interaction between atoms and electromagnetic fields is almost exclusively associated with the idea that momentum transfer is a way of slowing down atoms to extremely low - temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , non trivial consequences on light propagation have been uncovered as well .",
    "for instance , in the realm of single - atom effects , the so - called recoil induced resonances ( rir ) have been investigated both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been conjectured that atomic recoil can collectively give rise to coherent propagation through backreflection from a spontaneously generated density grating : the so called collective atomic recoil laser ( carl )  @xcite .",
    "finally , connections between the two approaches have been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the very first observation of spontaneous backward emission was made in a ring cavity experiment  @xcite , where the very low  transverse temperature \" might have been responsible for carl amplification .",
    "more detailed experimental accounts have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , although it was not possible to establish whether the generation of the backward field was due to the spontaneous formation of a density grating , or viceversa .",
    "in fact , although it was later ascertained that recoil plays a prominent role  @xcite in the underlying physics  @xcite , an alternative interpretation based on the formation of a standard polarization grating could not be entirely ruled out  @xcite .",
    "only recently has the first convincing evidence of carl been given in a beautiful experiment performed on a sample of cold rubidium atoms  @xcite .    on the theoretical side , too , no final conclusion could be drawn on the carl features , because the first model allowed only investigating the transient regime .",
    "stationary states have been obtained for the first time by including collisions with an external buffer gas @xcite . by simulating a low - temperature ( a few mk ) sodium vapour in the detuning range previously considered in the ( numerical ) literature ,",
    "a nonequilibrium phase transition leading to a stationary nonzero backward field ( above a given threshold ) was therein identified .",
    "however , such a collective phenomenon could not be linked to the onset of a density grating , but rather to the birth of a nontrivial polarization grating  @xcite .",
    "the overall scenario has been observed also in a more general model accounting for the input - field dynamics  @xcite and has been successively clarified in  @xcite with the help of the elimination of the atomic variables ; indeed , this step rendered the derivation of an effective free - energy potential for the backward field amplitude possible , thereby clearly showing the existence of a phase transition .    in this paper",
    "we show numerically and theoretically that this latter model also accounts for the carl and allows one to understand its onset in terms of a continuous phase transition characterized by two effective variables .",
    "the resulting estimate of the critical point is compatible with the experimental results reported in @xcite .",
    "the results presented here provide the first substantial and systematic progress towards a proof of the existence , in stable form , of a collective interaction , which , predicted years ago  @xcite , had so far proven to be elusive .",
    "more precisely , we investigate the transition which gives rise , spontaneously ",
    "i.e. , without an external probe field ",
    ", to a coherent electromagnetic field counterpropagating with respect to the injected one .",
    "we choose to consider the ring - cavity - based model introduced in @xcite for two reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the available single - pass model  @xcite has intrinsic shortcomings  @xcite which may be of little consequence in particular circumstances , but which renders it nonetheless less attractive . on the other hand , the most recent experimental results  @xcite , which can be considered at the present time as the first and only available observation of a true carl system ,",
    "have been obtained in a ring cavity .",
    "hence , the choice of a bidirectional ring cavity model imposes itself .",
    "a strong concern , which tainted all previous predictions and experimental attempts at studying this problem , regards the influence of external perturbations ( collisions , finite transit time in the interaction volume , `` optical friction '' , etc . ) on the collective dynamics .",
    "one can conjecture that their presence could destroy the phase transition or , at least , affect it so strongly as to shift it to an unphysical region of parameter values .",
    "our purpose in this work is to investigate such mechanisms using different approaches and mathematical / numerical tools , to obtain a convincing picture .",
    "section  [ mod ] introduces the model we used in the investigation and discusses , in subsection[relax ] , the main physical relaxation mechanisms that may take place in an experiment .",
    "the appropriate modeling tools for analyzing the two main mechanisms are introduced here .",
    "section  [ num ] is devoted to a systematic numerical analysis which allows us to highlight the origin of the forces that give rise to a transition of the carl - type ",
    "i.e. , caused by the appearence of a spatial density grating  as opposed to the one recently predicted  @xcite , based on an unusual polarization grating and possibly responsible for high - temperature experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the numerical approach makes it possible to isolate the different source terms and identify in which range of temperature each of them is predominant .",
    "analytical descriptions present the advantage of offering a better understanding of the physics driving the system .",
    "since the full problem is obviously analytically unmanageable , it is useful to study some limiting situations .",
    "this is done in section  [ large ] , where we consider the case of large detuning between fields and atomic resonance . in this spirit",
    ", we describe the perturbations introduced by transit broadening ( subsection  [ vlasov ] ) and show that a second - order transition appears which can be described by expanding the spatial inhomogeneities in fourier modes .",
    "the first and most relevant mode coincides with the _ bunching parameter _ , previously introduced to quantify the density grating  @xcite .",
    "losses introduced by an optical molasses are studied in subsection  [ fp ] with the help of a fokker - planck equation that can be analytically solved in the large dissipation limit .",
    "predictions resulting from the preceding analyses are offered in section  [ predictions ] , together with a comparison with the recent experimental results  @xcite .",
    "some conclusions and perspectives are presented in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the starting model involves four dimensionless variables ( one being complex ) accounting for the single atom dynamics plus two complex equations describing the amplitude of forward ( @xmath0 ) and backward ( @xmath1 ) uniform fields  @xcite @xmath2(|\\delta_a|/2 g ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\dot s_j & = &    g ( x_f { \\rm e}^{i\\theta_j } +   x_b { \\rm e}^{-i\\theta_j})d_j   - ( \\gamma_\\perp \\!-\\!i\\delta_a)s_j ,   \\label{general } \\\\",

    "time and related parameters are expressed in units of the photon life - time inside the cavity , @xmath4 , namely : the decay rates of the atomic polarization ( @xmath5 ) and population inversion ( @xmath6 ) , the detuning @xmath7 between input field and atomic frequencies , and the cavity detuning @xmath8 ( i.e. the distance from the nearest cavity resonance ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the two coupling constants ( @xmath11 is the atomic mass , @xmath12 the field wavenumber , @xmath13 the unsaturated absorption rate per unit length , @xmath14 the length of the atomic medium , and @xmath15 the cavity s transmittivity ) . the amplitude @xmath16 of the injected field is scaled such that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the atomic dipole moment , @xmath19 is the input power , and @xmath20 the beam surface , expressed in physical units .",
    "an equivalent scaling is used for the forward and backward intracavity components , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally : ( i ) @xmath21 is the scaled atomic position ; ( ii ) the atomic momentum @xmath22 is rescaled to @xmath23 ; ( iii ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the atomic polarisation and population inversion , the first being expressed in units of @xmath18 .      while dissipation mechanisms affecting the internal degrees of freedom and the field amplitudes are accounted for by the above model , no losses acting on the atomic momentum",
    "are therein included . as a result ,",
    "atoms are continuously accelerated by radiation pressure , and eqs .",
    "( [ general ] ) can thereby describe only the transient regime corresponding to the early stages of carl amplification .    in actual experimental situations ,",
    "relaxation processes may be induced by various mechanisms , the main ones being : ( a ) collisions with a buffer gas ( those between optically active atoms can be neglected under all realistic circumstances ) , ( b ) finite residence time in the interaction volume ( added to some relaxation occurring outside it ) , and ( c ) `` viscous '' losses ( e.g. , as in an optical molasses ) . collisions with a buffer gas require fairly high pressures and have been often used in the investigation of nonlinear coupling between atoms and light ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in a numerical scheme ,",
    "this relaxation processes can be implemented as a coupling with a thermal bath , efficiently simulated with `` molecular dynamics ''  @xcite techniques .",
    "more precisely , a random sequence of inter - collision times is independently generated for each atom according to an exponential distribution with average value equal to @xmath26 . at each collision , the momentum of the colliding , @xmath27-th , atom is randomly reset according to the gaussian distribution @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the rescaled temperature of the buffer gas ( @xmath30 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath31 is the temperature in physical units ) ; moreover , the phase of the atomic polarization @xmath32 is also reset to a value uniformly distributed in the whole range @xmath33 $ ] , as @xmath34 remains unchanged .",
    "notice that this algorithm amounts to implicitely assuming that active and buffer - gas atoms have equal masses .",
    "the finite transit time ( b ) introduces effective losses and has certainly played the main role in several experiments  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , the atoms spend a more or less small fraction of time inside the interaction volume , which they enter and exit at random positions and in a random state ( both for the velocity and for the internal degrees of freedom ) .",
    "outside the interaction region , the atoms suffer thermalization , either through collisions with other atoms ( e.g. , a low pressure buffer gas ) , with a container , or are simply renewed through `` fresh '' atoms coming from a beam ; hence , the effective relaxation comes from the loss of `` synchronized '' atoms ( both for the external and the internal degrees of freedom ) compensated , in average , by the entrance into the interaction volume , of `` random '' atoms .",
    "this phenomenon can be reinterpreted as a `` reset '' in the external and internal degrees of freedom of the atom in question . at the microscopic level ,",
    "one can still adopt a description based on the thermalization scheme discussed in ( a ) , by modelling each random exit / entrance in the active volume as a  collision \" ; the main difference with the previous case is that all atomic variables have now to be reset . at the macroscopic level , the mathematical tool most suited for such a description is a vlasov equation , where the probability distribution for the atomic position and momentum are dynamically investigated .",
    "these considerations are the basis for the discussion of section  [ vlasov ] .",
    "the third mechanism ( c ) , recently employed in  @xcite , is an optical molasses , added in the experiment to obtain steady state backward emission . here",
    ", the `` molasses field '' slows down the atoms by the standard cooling action while introducing a `` friction '' which prevents the doppler shift from growing so large as to render the interaction with the field entirely negligible .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that under the assumption of a small saturation parameter of the molasses field , the momentum dynamics is well described by a langevin equation ( compare with the second of eqs .",
    "( [ general ] ) ) , @xmath35(|\\delta_a|/2 g ) -\\gamma p_{j } +           \\eta_{j},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a standard white noise , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the kronecker symbol ) accounting for the inevitable fluctuations that thermalize the atom to a finite temperature @xmath39 . in section  [ fp ] , we will study this model in the limit of large detuning , a condition well verified in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "we now intend to explore the predictions of the model , eqs .  [ general ] , from a purely numerical point of view to provide a starting point for the later analysis .",
    "in particular , we are interested in studying the existence of a _ steady state bunching _ in the presence of a backward propagating field .",
    "we remark that the observation of a stable value of bunching in a bidirectional ring cavity has never been reported .",
    "previous observations , obtained without cavity  @xcite , have shown a strongly oscillating , irregular behaviour for this variable . in the other kind of observed transition  @xcite , instead",
    ", the @xmath40 distribution remains flat ( within the fluctuations imposed by the sample size ) both below and above threshold .",
    "hence , the mere numerical observation of a stable , steady bunching represents an important step towards generalizing the carl predictions  @xcite .",
    "such an observation is , however , not sufficient in itself .",
    "the question arises naturally , whether the backward field is originated by the growth of a nonhomogenous longitudinal atomic distribution , or whether the spatial inhomogeneity results as a consequence of a preexisting optical standing wave , generated by other source terms .",
    "although apparently obvious , this point is far from being trivial .",
    "indeed , any standing wave is going to generate a whole hierarchy of gratings ( atomic polarization and inversion , index of refraction and  if the atoms are free to move  atomic density ) , but one needs to identify the true source . in this system ,",
    "a source term which gives rise to a collective state has already been identified in the nontrivial grating in the atomic polarization s",
    "phase  @xcite , while a standard polarization modulation ( without phase transition ) has been proposed  @xcite as a possible mechanism for interpreting experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "in order to characterize the appearence of a spatial inhomogeneity in the atomic distribution , we introduce the characteristic function of the position ( @xmath41 ) distribution defined in terms of its fourier modes @xmath42 introducing the normalised variable @xmath40 , the general definition eq .",
    "( [ bunch_def_general ] ) reads , with our normalisation , @xmath43 the direct integration of model ( [ general ] ) , using the same techniques as outlined in  @xcite ( i.e. with thermalization induced by collisions ) , provides the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rise ] .",
    "[ fig_rise]a shows the appearence of several fourier modes , which reach a steady state amplitude after the backward field has grown to its final value ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rise]b , solid line ) .",
    "we stress that the latter grows from zero spontaneously , without any _ seed _ being injected in the computation .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_rise]a we remark that one fourier component of the atomic spatial distribution significantly grows away from zero well before the backward field begins to deviate from its initial value .",
    "we will take this as a suggestion , to be later verified , that the bunching is responsible for the appearence of the counterpropagating field .",
    "the harmonic components , instead , seem to be generated by the interaction of the inhomogeneously distributed atoms and the optical standing wave generated by the two macroscopic counterpropagating fields , ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition , we also see how the forward field ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig_rise]b ) is modified by the presence of the spatially modulated atomic distribution .",
    "the physical picture described by this figure is the following : the cavity initially contains the atoms and no fields . at time @xmath44 , we start injecting the external component @xmath16 , collinear with the forward direction . during the transient preceding synchronisation ,",
    "the atoms use part of the energy to adapt their positions and velocities , thus building up a non homogeneous spatial distribution .",
    "we remark that the total energy injected into the cavity ( see dot - dashed line ) is larger than that contained in the two field components at steady state ( @xmath45 time units ) .",
    "the fact that both fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , grow nearly to the same value implies that one can not neglect the dynamics of the forward field .",
    "this dynamics maximizes the spatial modulation and _ both _ fields adapt themselves to the global coupling that ensues .",
    "it is also crucial to remark that , although the spatial atomic inhomogeneity appears to be responsible for the generation of the backward field , at time @xmath46 time units , the @xmath47 component has reached only one third of its final value .",
    "hence , the rest of the modulation ( fundamental plus all the harmonics ) , results from the interaction with the optical standing wave .",
    "this point is significant , since it implies that the scattering from one field into the other is going to be quite symmetric : any increase in one component will imply a larger number of photons in one direction , hence a larger scattered contribution from that direction into the other .",
    "the residual difference between the forward ( dashed line , fig .",
    "[ fig_rise]a ) and the backward field is to be attributed to the fact that the former receives an additional contribution from the external injection ; hence the corresponding mode contains more photons at any time .",

    "a more convincing illustration of the active role played by the density grating in the generation of the backward field , can be gained by decomposing the  force \" field acting on the intensity @xmath60 of the backward field into two contributions @xmath61 where @xmath62 . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    ", due to cavity losses , has always a stabilizing effect , while @xmath63 , which accounts for the atomic contribution , can be either stabilizing or destabilizing .",
    "in order to gain some insight on the resulting dynamics , we compare the force fields generated in the presence and in the absence of bunching , respectively .",
    "we do this under the assumption that the atomic degrees of freedom can be neglected  @xcite , i.e. that the relevant dynamical properties are contained in the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath1 and @xmath0 . as long as the atomic variables rapidly converge to a stationary state",
    ", one can treat @xmath50 and @xmath49 as if they were fixed parameters and thereby numerically determine the  force \" field for different choices of the two amplitudes . in principle",
    ", one should also take care of the time - dependence associated with the detuning @xmath65 between the two fields ; however , numerical simulations of the full model have revealed that the  force \" field depends very weakly on @xmath65 .",
    "the force resulting for the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "[ fig_rise ] is plotted in fig .",
    "[ forcefield ] for different values of the backward field amplitude .",
    "the solid line with no symbols represents the total effective `` force '' acting on the backward field .",
    "steady state operation exists only when the resulting total force is zero , and its stability is obviously determined by the local slope .",
    "it is clear that the zero - field state is unstable , while @xmath66 is a stable one . in this latter regime",
    ", one can state that the destabilizing action of the atomic contribution , @xmath67 ( dashed curve without symbols in fig .",
    "[ forcefield ] ) , is balanced by the stabilizing effect due to the cavity loss term , @xmath60 .    in order to test of the _ true role _ played by atomic bunching ( i.e. , as a _ master _ or a _ slave _ variable )",
    ", we have proceeded to  switching off \" both collisions and optical forces acting on the atoms ( this is obviously possible only in a simulation ) . the corresponding curves representing @xmath67 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ forcefield ] ) and the total force , @xmath68 , ( solid line ) are identified by symbols . as a result of the absence of external perturbations ,",
    "each atomic position @xmath69 evolves linearly according to the velocity value at the  switch off \" time ; in this way , the density grating is rapidly washed out . this procedure allows us to separate the possible gain component coming from the density grating from the one arising in a pumped ensemble of two - level systems @xcite .",
    "the stationary value of @xmath64 under such conditions remains always negative ( so does _ a fortiori _ the total force ) , indicating that the presence of a density grating is an _ indispensable _ ingredient to maintain a finite backward field .",
    "notice that this is at variance with the transition studied in @xcite , where the force field would be positive even in the absence of a density grating @xcite .",
    "hence , we can safely conclude that the onset of a finite backward field is a clear example of carl and that the steady state bunching obtained is the _ cause _ for the appearence for the backward field component , and not _ a consequence _ of the existence of an optical standing wave ( cf .",

    "in section  [ num ] we have just reported purely numerical observations . in the perspective of constructing an analytical description of the transition ,",
    "it is important to identify the possibly few relevant variables . for this purpose",
    "we concentrate on the large detuning limit , where the standard adiabatic elimination holds .",
    "although this allows us to analytically treat only a limiting case , we will draw from it the benefit of later comparing the predictions of this approach to the recent experimental observations  @xcite , obtained with very large detuning between field and atoms ( @xmath71 ) .",

    "we now study the stability of the solution @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , by introducing the perturbations @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
