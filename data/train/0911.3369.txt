    "the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) nearby galaxies legacy survey ( ngls ) is an 850  @xmath0 m and co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) survey with the goals of studying molecular gas and dust in a representative sample of galaxies within 25  mpc .",
    "the sample contains three subsets : a subset of 31 galaxies from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sample ; an hi flux - limited sample of 36 galaxies in the virgo cluster ; and an hi flux - limited sample of 72 field galaxies . at this point in time , co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) observations of the sings galaxies and virgo cluster galaxies have been completed . aside from the 3.6 - 160  @xmath0 m data from sings that resolve structures less than a kiloparsec in size in the closest galaxies , hi nearby galaxies",
    "survey ( things ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also available for many of these galaxies . together , these data are a powerful dataset for studying the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) on sub - kiloparsec scales within nearby galaxies such as variations in gas - to - dust ratios on sub - kiloparsec scales .",
    "gas - to - dust ratios within nearby galaxies have been a major topic of research since the launch of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "debate on this subject began when dust masses derived from iras 60 and 100  @xmath0 m data seemed a factor of 10 too low to match what was expected either from the depletion of metals from the ism or from the ratio of gas column density to dust extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent calculations of global gas and dust masses using _ spitzer",
    "_ space telescope @xcite and james clerk maxwell telescope data for spiral galaxies produce gas - to - dust mass ratios of @xmath5 ( e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the measured ratios are reliant upon co to h@xmath6 mass conversion factors that do not vary with metallicity or star formation activity , the ratios that were measured are close to what is expected from the ratio for the milky way derived from the comparison of gas column densities to optical extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from the depletion of metals from the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the natural expectation would be that dust emission from kiloparsec - sized regions should be correlated with the sum of atomic and molecular gas emission on those spatial scales .",
    "however , since the gas - to - dust ratio depends on metallicity and since metallicity varies with radius within most galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gas - to - dust ratio should decrease with radius .",
    "for the most part , these assumptions are only beginning to be tested , mainly because the combination of hi , co , and far - infrared dust emission data that is resolved on kiloparsec scales has not been available for nearby galaxies .",
    "related to this topic is the association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in the mid - infrared and other constituents of the cold ism .",
    "several observational studies using data from either the infrared space observatory ( iso ; * ? ? ?",
    "spitzer _ have shown that , in nearby spiral galaxies , pah emission is strongly correlated with cold ( @xmath2 k ) dust emission in the far - infrared , at least on scales @xmath7  kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , @xcite found that pah emission is correlated with co spectral line emission at submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths within nearby spiral galaxies , although these results are based on using radial averages .",
    "these results strongly suggested that pah emission is a tracer of both dust and gas in the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) .    some of the sings / things / jcmt ngls galaxies have already been used in comparisons of hi and co emission with star formation , including measures of star formation that incorporate 24  @xmath0 m emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have found that star formation is correlated with molecular gas surface density or with a sum of molecular and atomic gas surface density ; no correlation exists between star formation and hi emission by itself . since 24",
    "@xmath0 m dust emission is included in these comparisons , the results imply that dust emission should be correlated with molecular or total gas surface densities but not with atomic gas surface densities , although a direct comparison between dust , atomic gas , and molecular gas is needed .    as a first look into these topics with the combined sings , things , and jcmt ngls data , we compare pah , cold dust , co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) , and h i on sub - kiloparsec scales for ngc  2403 .",
    "this sabcd spiral galaxy @xcite was selected because it is relatively nearby ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the distance to the galaxy is @xmath8  mpc ; ) , the galaxy and the dust emission is very extended ( the optical disc is 21.9  arcmin @xmath9 12.3  arcmin ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the inclination is @xmath10 @xcite , the galaxy is close enough to face - on that it is possible to distinguish spiral structures and individual star - forming regions . as is found in similar late - type spiral galaxies , the regions with the strongest star formation are located outside the centre of of the galaxy ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the cold dust emission peaks in the centre @xcite .",
    "consequently , emission related to star formation can be easily disentangled from emission related to dust surface density .",
    "we use the 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m data taken with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on _ spitzer _ as part of sings .",
    "the observations consisted of a series of 5  arcmin @xmath9 5  arcmin individual frames taken in a mosaic pattern that covers a 25  arcmin @xmath9 25  arcmin region .",
    "the data used for this analysis come from astronomical observation requests ( aors ) 5505792 and 5505536 , which were separated by four days ; these separate observations allow for the identification and removal of transient phenomena , particularly asteroids .",
    "the full - width half - maxima ( fwhm ) of the point spread functions ( psfs ) , as stated in the spitzer observer s manual @xcite , are 1.7 and 2.0  arcsec at 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "details on the observations can be found in the documentation for the sings fifth data delivery @xcite .",
    "the final images were created from version 14 of the basic calibrated data frames produced by the spitzer science center .",
    "the data were then processed through the sings irac pipeline , which applies distortion and rotation corrections , adjusts the offsets among the data frames , removes cosmic rays , subtracts the background , and then combines them together using a drizzle technique .",
    "a description of the technique is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration is expected to be accurate to 3% @xcite .",
    "the final irac images include a residual background with a gradient .",
    "we interpolated a smoothed version of the background outside the optical disc of the galaxy to determine the background levels within the optical disc , and we then subtracted this background from the data .",
    "we then masked out regions contaminated by emission from bright foreground stars ( identified as unresolved sources in the unconvolved irac data with 3.6  @xmath0m/8  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios @xmath11 ) .",
    "to correct for the diffusion of light through the irac detector substrate , the 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m data are multiplied by the `` infinite '' aperture corrections described by @xcite , which should not be confused with the types of aperture corrections used for measuring the flux densities of unresolved sources .",
    "the correction factors are 0.944 and 0.737 at 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "we then subtracted the stellar continuum from the 8  @xmath0 m surface brightness maps ( in mjy sr@xmath12 ) using @xmath13 which was derived by @xcite .",
    "we will henceforth refer to this as pah 8  @xmath0 m emission so as to distinguish it from the 8  @xmath0 m emission that includes stellar continuum emission .",
    "we used the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) 70 and 160  @xmath0 m data taken of ngc  2403 as part of sings .",
    "these observations are composed of the aors 5549568 and 5549824 .",
    "these aors are scan map observations of the galaxy that were performed at the medium scan speed .",
    "each scan map is @xmath14 wide and @xmath15 long , which is sufficiently wide to cover the entire optical disc of the galaxy .",
    "the two aors were executed three days apart so as to allow for the identification and removal of transient sources , although most detectable sources usually affect only the 24  @xmath0 m band .",
    "the fwhm of the psfs are 18  arcsec at 70  @xmath0 m and 38  arcsec at 160  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the documentation for the sings fifth data delivery @xcite contains additional details on the observing strategy .",
    "the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m images were created from raw data frames using the mips data analysis tools ( mips dat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) version 3.10 along with additional processing steps .",
    "first , ramps were fit to the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m reads to derive slopes . in this step ,",
    "readout jumps and cosmic ray hits were also removed , and an electronic nonlinearity correction was applied .",
    "next , the stim flash frames ( frames of data in which a calibration light source was flashed at the detectors ) were used as responsivity corrections .",
    "after this , the dark current was subtracted from the data , and an illumination correction was applied . following this , short term variations in the signal ( often referred to as drift )",
    "were removed , and additional periodic variations in the background related to the stim flash cycle were subtracted ; this also subtracted the background from the data .",
    "next , a robust statistical analysis was applied to cospatial pixels from different frames in which statistical outliers ( which could be pixels affected by cosmic rays ) were masked out .",
    "once this was done , final mosaics were made using pixel sizes of 4.5  arcsec@xmath16 for the 70  @xmath0 m data and 9  arcsec@xmath16 for the 160  @xmath0 m data .",
    "the residual backgrounds in the data were measured in regions outside the optical discs of the galaxies and subtracted , and then flux calibration factors ( given as @xmath17 mjy sr@xmath12 [ mips instrumental unit]@xmath12 for the 70  @xmath0 m data by @xcite and @xmath18 mjy sr@xmath19 [ mips instrumental unit]@xmath12 for the 160  @xmath0 m data by @xcite ) were applied to the data .",
    "an additional 70  @xmath0 m nonlinearity correction given as @xmath20 by @xcite was applied to coarse - scale imaging data where the surface brightness exceeded 66 mjy sr@xmath12 .",
    "the final 70  @xmath0 m image is affected by latent images , which are dark images that appear after the array has observed a bright source .",
    "the latent image effects result in dark streaks to the northwest and southeast of the galaxy centre at the edge of the region detected at 70  @xmath0 m ( at @xmath217:37:20 @xmath22 + 65:40:00 and @xmath217:36:35 @xmath22 + 65:32:00 ) .",
    "our algorithms tend to exclude the emission from these regions , so the latent image effects only have a very minor impact on the analysis .",
    "we performed several analysis steps in using 70 and 160  @xmath0 m flux densities to calculate dust masses .",
    "first , we convolved the 70  @xmath0 m data with a kernel that matches the psf of the data to the psf of the 160  @xmath0 m data ( see sec .",
    "[ s_data_kernel ] below ) .",
    "next , we regridded the 160  @xmath0 m data so that its coordinate system matched the 70  @xmath0 m data . after this step",
    ", we only used data for pixels detected at the @xmath23 level in the convolved data for each wave band so that systematic effects such as offsets in the background would not strongly affect the results .",
    "we proceeded to fit blackbodies @xmath24 with temperatures @xmath25 modified by @xmath26 emissivity functions to the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m data for each pixel meeting this signal - to - noise criterion so as to determine the approximate dust temperatures . following this",
    ", we calculated dust masses within individual pixels using @xmath27 which is a variant of an equation derived by @xcite . in this equation , @xmath28 is the distance to the galaxy , @xmath29 is the flux density , @xmath30 represents the absorption opacity of the dust , and @xmath24 is the blackbody function for the best fitting temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we used the 160  @xmath0 m flux densities in equation  [ e_dustmass ] because the data were taken from the rayleigh - jeans side of the thermal dust emission and are therefore less sensitive to uncertainties in temperature .",
    "the value for @xmath30 at 160  @xmath0 m is given by @xcite as 12.0  cm@xmath16  g@xmath12 .",
    "the dust masses were then converted to dust surface densities by dividing the pixels by their surface area in pc@xmath16 .",
    "as a test of the robustness of the results against systematic offsets in the background , we increased the background in one wave band by @xmath32 , decreased it in the other by @xmath32 , and then measured the total dust mass and the exponential scale length of the radial profile for the dust surface density ( described in section  [ s_gasdust ] ) .",
    "we found that the dust mass only varied @xmath33% and that the scale length varied by only @xmath34 when this was done , even though systematic offsets of this magnitude seem highly unrealistic .",
    "this is a simplistic approach to calculating dust masses , but it should provide approximate measurements of the dust masses within this galaxy .",
    "more sophisticated dust models , such as those presented by @xcite and @xcite , include multiple thermal components of dust heated by radiation fields with variable strengths and also account for the different spectral energy distributions of grains of different sizes .",
    "unfortunately , those models include many free parameters , and so when only two wave bands are available for defining the far - infrared dust sed , as is the case for our analysis of subregions in ngc  2403 , we can not accurately apply complex dust sed models .",
    "fortunately , when the dust masses predicted by the models of @xcite are compared with the dust masses calculated using a single thermal component fit to @xmath35  @xmath0 m data , the masses agree to within a factor of 2 - 4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dust masses estimated from a single thermal component should still be useful for our analysis .",
    "it is possible that the observations here may have missed the presence of very cold dust ( dust with temperatures @xmath36  k ) that may not contribute strongly to the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m bands but that may constitute the bulk of the dust mass within this galaxy .",
    "if present , this very cold dust emission would be detected at 200 - 1000  @xmath0 m .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any useful data with which to search for the presence of such emission .",
    "some archival jcmt scuba data are available , but nothing is detected with a signal - to - noise level of @xmath37 in the data . moreover ,",
    "it is unclear whether submillimetre emission that exceeds thermal dust emission models fit to @xmath38  @xmath0 m originates from large masses of cold dust or from dust with unexpectedly high submillimetre emissivities . in any case",
    ", most current studies on this subject suggest that the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m bands can be used without submillimetre data to produce reasonably accurate estimates of the dust mass .",
    "see appendix  [ a_dust ] for an extended discussion .",
    "the co  @xmath1=3 - 2 line observations were obtained at the jcmt as part of the jcmt ngls , using the 16 element heterodyne array harp - b with the backend spectrometer acsis @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of the beam is 14.5  arcsec .",
    "we give an overview of the observation and data reduction procedures here . for a more detailed explanation of the general jcmt ngls observing and data reduction process for raster maps see warren et al .",
    "( 2009 , submitted ) .",
    "observations for ngc  2403 by the jcmt ngls took place over two runs in november 2007 and january 2008 .",
    "we mapped the galaxy using a basketweave raster scanning method , with half array steps between scan rows / columns .",
    "the target area was a rectangular region with a position angle of @xmath39 rotated from north through east and with a size of 11.7  arcmin  @xmath9  6.2  arcmin , which corresponds to half of the optical diameter along both the major and minor axes .",
    "the correlator was configured to have a bandwidth of @xmath401  ghz and a resolution of 0.488  mhz ( 0.43  kms@xmath12 at the frequency of the @xmath41co@xmath1=3 - 2 transition ) centered at 121  kms@xmath12 . for each scan",
    ", we integrated for 5  s per pointing within the target field , and scans were repeated until we reached the target rms for the survey ( 19  mk ( @xmath42 ) after binning to 20  km  s@xmath12 resolution ) . after rejecting one half of an individual scan that failed the survey quality assurance criteria , the total integration time was up to 62.5 seconds per point ( depending on the number of contributing receptors that were not flagged or missing in the array ) .    data reduction and most of the analysis were carried out with the version of the starlink software package that is maintained by the joint astronomy centre @xcite .",
    "first , data for individual receptors with bad baselines were flagged and removed from the data .",
    "generally , two to four receptors in a scan were flagged .",
    "after this , the raw scans were combined into a data cube using a @xmath43 kernel as the weighting function to determine the contribution of individual receptors to each pixel .",
    "the @xmath44 function was used instead of other weighting functions because it significantly reduces the noise in the maps while having a very minor effect on the resolution .",
    "the resulting cube was then trimmed to remove the leading and trailing scan ends outside the target field , where the scan coverage is incomplete .",
    "a mask was created to identify line - free regions of the data cube , and a third - order baseline was fit to those line - free regions .",
    "the clumpfind algorithm @xcite , implemented as part of the starlink / cupid task findclumps @xcite , was used to identify regions with emission above two times the rms noise in a data cube that had been boxcar smoothed by 3 pixels and 25 velocity channels .",
    "moment maps were created from the original data cube using a mask created from findclumps .",
    "we converted the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data from corrected antenna temperature ( @xmath42 ) to the main beam temperature scale by dividing by @xmath45 .",
    "the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission is not detected beyond radii of @xmath46  kpc ( which corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath47  arcsec along the major axis ) .",
    "for some of the analysis in this paper , the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission is converted into molecular gas surface density .",
    "the conversion factor is dependent on a comparison between the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and @xmath1=(1 - 0 ) line emission .",
    "we discuss both of these topics in section  [ s_cocompare ] .",
    "we compared the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data with co  @xmath1=(1 - 0 ) data from two sources .",
    "we primarily used co  @xmath1=(1 - 0 ) data taken by @xcite using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 12 meter telescope .",
    "the observations were performed as a series of pointings separated by 30  arcsec that approximately cover the central 5.5  arcmin  @xmath48  arcmin of the galaxy .",
    "these data have a fwhm of 54  arcsec and a spectral resolution of 2.6  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "since the spacing between the pointings is smaller than the beam , we can treat these data as a fully sampled map .",
    "table  1 by @xcite gives the integrated line intensities ( based on main beam temperatures ) and uncertainties that they measured in individual pointings across the optical disc of the galaxy ; we used these data to construct a co  @xmath1=(1 - 0 ) image .",
    "upper limits were treated as 0 for our analysis .",
    "see @xcite for additional details on the observations and data reduction .",
    "we also had access to co  @xmath1=(1 - 0 ) data taken in the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( song ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the @xmath49  arcsec fwhm of the beam for the data is superior to that for both harp - b and the nrao 12  m data , the bima song data have problems that make it less suitable for our analysis . a comparison of the bima song data to the nrao 12  m data revealed that only @xmath50% of the flux was recovered @xcite , and the area in which sources are detected in the bima song data is significantly smaller than that for either the harp - b or nrao 12  m data .",
    "while we still use the bima song data for a qualitative comparison to other data , we will not use it for quantitative comparisons .",
    "the hi data used for this analysis were taken by things @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed with the very large array in the b , c , and d configurations , which ensured fairly uniform sensitivity from the largest scales all the way to the resolution limit set by the long baselines of b - array .",
    "calibrated , continuum - subtracted data cubes were created using the astronomical image processing system .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the calibration uncertainty , which is 5% .",
    "things released two data products that differ based on the weighting of the data .",
    "we used the data with the natural weighting . in these data , all visibility points in the @xmath51 plane are weighted equally .",
    "large - scale structures , including the diffuse , extended hi emission that may be associated with diffuse interstellar dust , should be more easily detected in the data with the natural weighting .",

    ", a comparison between the vla data and single - dish data from the literature compiled by @xcite showed a strong agreement for most things galaxies including ngc  2403 , indicating that significant emission is not missing from the vla data because of gaps in the coverage of the @xmath51 plane .",

    "therefore , we also use a second set of molecular gas surface density data calculated using @xmath81 @xmath82 ( k km s@xmath12)@xmath12 , which was derived by @xcite using models of gamma ray scattering that did not include radial variations .",
    "@xcite indicated that radiation field strength could be a second factor that affects @xmath83 , although some authors have not found evidence for such a dependency ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the application of the relation found by @xcite to our data does not appear straightforward .",
    "the metric for radiation field intensity used by @xcite uses the ratio of the far - infrared surface brightnesses measured using iras data to the neutral hydrogen density . because iras data does not sample the rayleigh - jeans side of the dust sed in the same way that _ spitzer _",
    "data does , we would need to convert the far - infrared fluxes derived from _ spitzer _ data to match that calculated from iras data , which may not be straightforward .",
    "moreover , @xcite derived his relation using subregions within dwarf galaxies where radial variations in abundances were not present and therefore where variations in the gas - to - dust ratio should not be present , whereas ngc  2403 clearly exhibits radial variations in abundances and therefore may exhibit radial variations in the gas - to - dust ratio that would affect the radiation field intensity metric .",
    "fortunately , @xcite found that it should still be possible to derive a reasonable approximation for @xmath72 based on its relation to oxygen abundances alone .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we will not attempt to include an additional correction to @xmath72 for radiation field intensity , although we still discuss the implications of this dependency when appropriate .",
    "to compare the molecular , atomic , and dust surface densities , we first measured the radial profiles of the surface densities as well as the gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "first , all data were convolved with kernels that match the psfs to that of the 160  @xmath0 m data before radial profiles were extracted .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio was calculated on a pixel - by - pixel basis from images regridded to match the astrometry of the dust surface density images .",

    "this method for setting the annuli widths was used to avoid problems with noise caused by having too few pixels fall within given annuli , but the resulting annuli are small enough that the data , which have a psf with a fwhm of 38  arcsec , will be nyquist - sampled .",
    "pixels where co or hi line emission was not detected were set to 0 in those data .",
    "the ratio of the axes in the elliptical annuli were set to account for the inclination of the galaxy ( @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",

    "two versions of the h@xmath6 surface densities are shown .",
    "the values shown with a solid line were calculated using a constant @xmath72 , and the values shown with the dotted line were calculated using the formula for @xmath72 given in equation  [ e_xco_metal ] . for simplicity , we will refer to the former as the constant @xmath72 molecular gas surface density and the latter as the variable @xmath72 molecular gas surface density .",
    "although the standard deviation in the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profiles approaches the same level as the mean values at large radii , the uncertainties in the mean values are no wider than the thicknesses of these lines .",
    "hence , the mean values are very well defined even though significant variance may be seen in co intensities at specific radii .",
    "the figure shows that most of the mass in the interstellar medium of this galaxy is traced by the hi emission , a result also obtained by @xcite .",
    "the hi surface density is relatively flat ; it increases slightly towards 4  kpc and then declines gradually beyond that radius .",
    "the constant @xmath72 molecular gas surface density decreases exponentially with radius .",
    "the scale length of the constant @xmath72 molecular gas radial profile is @xmath84  kpc .",
    "the variable @xmath72 molecular gas surface density , however , is so close to flat that it is not possible to accurately fit an exponential function to the profile . the dust surface density , like the constant @xmath72 molecular gas surface density , decreases with radius .",
    "its radial profile has an exponential scale length of @xmath85  kpc .",
    "if we applied an additional correction for radiation field strength in @xmath72 , then this would increase the molecular gas surface density in regions with high radiation field intensities , which would correspond to regions in the centre of ngc  2403 with higher dust temperatures shown in figure  [ f_img_dusttemp ] .",
    "therefore , the molecular gas surface density radial profile would fall in between those of the constant @xmath72 and variable @xmath72 molecular gas surface densities plotted in figure  [ f_radpro_gasdust ] .    of particular interest",
    "is how the radial profiles of the molecular gas changes when the abundance - dependent correction is introduced .",
    "if the variable @xmath72 molecular gas surface density is an accurate depiction of the true surface density , then it implies that @xmath86% of the ism at large radii is comprised of molecular gas .",
    "if true , this would contradict the typical depiction of how the ratio of molecular to atomic gas varies within spiral galaxies , with the centres of galaxies being dominated by molecular gas and the outer discs being dominated by atomic gas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these prior results rely upon the assumption that @xmath72 is constant .",
    "this issue should be examined further using radial profile data for other galaxies and using deeper co data to determine if molecular gas surface densities calculated using an @xmath72 that depends on metallicity are found to still be significant contributors to the total gas surface density at larger radii and in other galaxies . if found to be true , then we need to more carefully consider how to convert co intensities into molecular gas surface densities and possibly revise the standard depiction of the structure of the ism in spiral galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ f_radpro_gasdust ] shows two radial profiles of the gas - to - dust ratio based on the two different molecular gas surface densities used in this analysis .",
    "both radial profiles increase relatively smoothly with radius . because the atomic gas is the largest component of the ism , differing assumptions in @xmath72 have only a minor impact on the radial profiles within the shown range . within a kpc of the center",

    "the expected gas - to - dust ratio in the milky way near the earth , based either on the measurement of the depletion of metals from the gaseous phase of the ism or on the ratio of gas column densities to optical extinction , is 100 - 200 @xcite . as we indicated above , the dust masses that we have calculated",
    "are low compared to more sophisticated models of dust emission , so it is unlikely that we have underestimated the central gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "instead , it is quite possible that the ism in the centre of ngc 2403 is relatively dust - rich .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio reaches a value of @xmath5 at about 2  kpc . at radii of 5.5  kpc , which is the limit of where we can accurately measure the radial profile of the dust in this galaxy , the ratio reaches @xmath4 .",

    "figure  [ f_img_gasdust ] is only useful as a qualitative demonstration of how the gas - to - dust ratio depends primarily on radius and not on gas surface density . as an additional quantitative demonstration of this phenomenon , we used techniques similar to what were used by @xcite in their comparisons of pah 8 , 24 , and 160  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "we used the hi , h@xmath6 ( calculated using a constant @xmath72 ) , and dust surface density maps that were used to create figure  [ f_img_gasdust ] .",
    "we rebinned these data into 45  arcsec pixels .",
    "this pixel size was selected because it is an integer multiple of the pixel size used for the mips data that is also close to the 38  arcsec fwhm of the 160  @xmath0 m data .",

    "the correlation coefficient for the relation between gas and dust surface densities in figure  [ f_gasvsdust ] is 0.73 , which would imply a good correlation .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient for the relation between the gas - to - dust ratio and radius is 0.91 .",
    "these results demonstrate that the relation between the gas - to - dust ratio and radius places stronger constraints on dust surface densities than the total gas surface density by itself .",
    "moreover , this quantitative approach confirms that the absence of visible structure in figure  [ f_img_gasdust ] is not simply a consequence of the poor resolution of the data .",
    "instead , it is a result of the gas - to - dust ratio being primarily dependent on radius .",
    "however , it is always possible that local variations in the gas - to - dust ratio will be visible in higher - resolution data .",
    "the most obvious driver for this gradient in the gas - to - dust ratio is the decrease in metallicity with radius that has been observed previously ( see section  [ s_data_abundance ] ) .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio is naturally expected to increase as abundances decrease simply because fewer constituents of dust should be present in the ism .",
    "gas - to - dust ratios significantly higher than the local milky way value of @xmath5 have been measured in many dwarf galaxies with low metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite have found linear relations between oxygen abundances and dust - to - gas ratios in nearby galaxies .",
    "although the dust - to - gas ratios typically decrease faster than the oxygen abundances in these relations , the slopes are still on the order of 1 .    as stated in [ s_data_abundance ] , the typical gradient in 12+log(o / h ) that has been measured in ngc  2403 is @xmath90  dex  kpc@xmath12 . for comparison , we measured the gradient in the logarithm of the dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath91 ) to be @xmath92  dex  kpc@xmath12 for ngc  2403 .",
    "these gradients are so close that it implies that the dust - to - gas ratio is primarily dependent on metallicity .",
    "alternatively , when we calculated 12+log(o / h ) as a function of radius , we found the relation between 12+log(o / h ) and @xmath91 had a slope of @xmath93 . this slope is less than 1 , which is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite , but it is so close to 1 that it implies a linear relationship between the oxygen abundance and the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "variations in the ratio of oxygen to the other constituents of dust could explain the difference in the gradients .",
    "@xcite , for example , has shown that c / o increases systematically with o / h within this galaxy as well as within m  101 , and since carbon is a primary constituent of dust , @xmath91 would be expected to be steeper than the gradient in 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "additional comparisons between radially - averaged dust - to - gas ratios and 12+log(o / h ) using all of the data from sings , things , and the jcmt ngls would be appropriate to determine whether similar results are typically obtained for all spiral galaxies .    some researchers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "first the gas - to - dust ratio is measured in a region dominated by atomic gas .",
    "second , that ratio is applied to a region that contains co and dust emission to determine how much molecular gas should be present , thus giving @xmath72 . however , the results here show that the application of this method to spiral galaxies must be performed cautiously .",
    "the first problem is that this method assumes that the gas - to - dust ratio is constant , whereas we have demonstrated that it varies with radius .",
    "the second problem is that , as explained in section  [ s_cocompare ] , @xmath72 may depend on metallicity , and metallicity will vary with radius in most nearby galaxies . despite these problems",
    ", it may still be possible to derive @xmath72 within subsections of galaxies by dividing the galaxies into elliptical annuli where both the metallicity and the gas - to - dust ratio will remain constant .",
    "if regions free of molecular gas but containing detectable atomic gas and dust emission can be identified within the individual annuli , then those locations can be used to measure the gas - to - dust ratio at specific radii .",
    "those regions can then be used to infer the gas - to - dust ratio for locations at similar radii that contain detectable co emission to determine how much gas should be present and therefore what @xmath72 is needed to account for all of the gas .",
    "this will then lead to a measure of @xmath72 as a function of radius .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to apply this method to the data used here . to perform this analysis correctly",
    ", we would need to work with data where the psfs matches the 40  arcsec resolution of the 160  @xmath0 m data .",
    "when the co data are matched to the 160  @xmath0 m psf , the area within radii of 4  kpc ( the region in which co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission is detected along the major axis ) contains almost no co - free regions for comparison to regions where co is detected .",
    "it is possible that the observations here may have missed the presence of very cold dust ( dust with temperatures @xmath36  k ) that may not contribute strongly to the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m bands but that may constitute the bulk of the dust mass at larger radii .",
    "as argued in appendix  [ a_dust ] , it is unclear in cases where submillimetre emission has been observed in excess of the @xmath2  k thermal dust models fit to the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m data whether this excess originates from large masses of @xmath36  k dust or very low masses of dust with enhanced submillimetre emissivities .",
    "results from previous analyses have suggested that estimates of the dust mass based on the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m wave bands should be well within an order of magnitude of the expected dust mass @xcite .",
    "based on these previous results , we expect the gas - to - dust ratio shown in figure  [ f_radpro_gasdust ] to be accurate and to not be strongly affected by large masses of dust not traced by the 70 and 160  @xmath0 m bands . it is nonetheless possible that the radial increase in our measured gas - to - dust ratio could be linked to an increase in the relative fraction of @xmath36  k dust with radius , but to properly determine this will require both submillimetre measurements of the dust emission and models of this dust emission that incorporate accurate submillimetre emissivities based on laboratory and theoretical results .",
    "as we are interested in re - examining the empirical correlation between co and pah emission found by @xcite using the higher - sensitivity harp - b data , and as they used radial profiles to show this correlation , we will first look at the radial profiles for the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) intensity and pah 8  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "since @xcite used the co intensities for their analysis instead of converting the co intensities to molecular gas surface densities , we will compare the pah 8  @xmath0 m surface brightnesses directly to the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) intensities .",

    "all data were convolved with kernels that match the psfs to that of the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data ( which has a fwhm of 14.5  arcsec ) before radial profiles were extracted .",
    "the techniques used for extracting these radial profiles are the same as those used in section  [ s_gasdust ] , although we only used data in which the co emission was detected to calculate the co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0 m ratio .",
    "the width of the elliptical annuli along the major axis in the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0 m ratio that we used was still equivalent to 2 pixels ( or 14.6  arcsec ) , which does not result in nyquist - sampled radial profiles .",
    "however , using narrower elliptical profiles results in excessive noise because of the low numbers of pixels falling within the elliptical annuli . while the standard deviations in the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0 m radial profiles are sometimes greater than the plotted radial means , just as was the case with the co radial profiles in figure  [ f_radpro_gasdust ] , the standard deviation does not equate to the the uncertainties in the means .",
    "the uncertainties in the means are actually smaller than the thickness of the lines in figure  [ f_radpro_gaspah ] except for the ratio of the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) intensity to pah 8  @xmath0 m surface brightness . in effect",
    ", we can actually measure the means to a relatively high precision , but we still see significant variance in the data .    in the top panel of the figure , we can see that the radial profile of the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0 m emission are similar to each other .",
    "in contrast , the hi radial profile is much broader than either the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) or pah 8  @xmath0 m radial profiles . given the dissimilarity between the pah 8  @xmath0 m and hi radial profiles as well as the dramatic differences between the appearance of the 8  @xmath0 m and hi images in figures  [ f_img ] and [ f_img_small ] , we can conclude that the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission is not associated with hi in this galaxy .",
    "we will not discuss the hi further but instead focus on the comparison between the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0 m .",
    "the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0",
    "m radial profiles not only appear superficially similar but also have similar exponential scale lengths . between 0.5  kpc and 4  kpc ,",
    "the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profile has an exponential scale length of @xmath94  kpc .",
    "the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission ( in the convolved data ) has a scale length of @xmath95  kpc over the same range .",
    "the plot of the ratio of the two in the bottom panel of figure  [ f_radpro_gaspah ] shows that the ratio between 0.5 and 4  kpc has a gradient of @xmath96 ( k  km  s@xmath12 ) ( mjy  sr@xmath12)@xmath12 kpc@xmath12 , but the mean value for the ratio stays between @xmath97 and @xmath98 at radii between 0.5 and 4  kpc .",
    "however , while the mean in the co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0",
    "m ratio remains relatively constant over this range of radii , the high standard deviation shows that the ratio fluctuates greatly at any given radius .",
    "the implications of this are discussed further below .",
    "the co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0 m emission ratio decreases sharply in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "this drop in the ratio corresponds to drops in the surface brightness in both wave bands .",
    "the drop in the ratio may be in part related to variations in the gas - to - dust ratio described in section  [ s_gasdust ] , but that would not explain why the ratio appears close to constant at larger radii , nor would it explain why the co and pah emission also drops near the nucleus .",
    "we can exclude the possibility that currently - ongoing intense nuclear star formation may be inhibiting pah emission ( either through destroying pahs or through changing their ionization state ) and ionizing gas in the centre of the galaxy ; both h@xmath70 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and 24  @xmath0 m images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the nucleus is relatively quiescent compared to other star - forming regions which do have pah 8  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) counterparts .",
    "because this galaxy is classified as having an hii nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and no other study indicates the presence of an agn in ngc  2403 , we can also exclude the possibility that an agn could be responsible for the decrease in pah and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission in the nucleus .",
    "the reason for the decrease in pah 8  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) in the nucleus of the galaxy may be explained by the simple fact that , like many other late - type spiral galaxies , the ism is clumpy and that this galaxy does not contain centrally - concentrated gas and dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the clumpiness of the ism would also explain why the standard deviations in the pah 8  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profiles in the top panel of figure  [ f_radpro_gaspah ] are very large .",
    "the co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0 m emission ratio may decrease towards the centre simply because the two wave bands may not be correlated on sub - kpc scales .",
    "the comparison of the pah 8  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) images in section  [ s_img ] visually demonstrates this ; some structures in the pah 8  @xmath0 m image were not as bright as those in the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) image and vice versa .",
    "additionally , the high standard deviation in the radial profile of the co @xmath1=(3 - 2)/pah 8  @xmath0 m ratio implies that the pah 8  @xmath0 m and co emission are not well - correlated at any given radius .    for an explicit quantitative analysis to demonstrate that pah 8  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission does not trace the same structures on small spatial scales , we could not use the same binning procedure used to compare the dust surface density versus total gas surface density in section  [ s_gasdust ] .",
    "the gaps between detected structures in the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) images made the binned data difficult to interpret .",
    "as an alternative , we used surface brightnesses measured in a series of discrete regions .",
    "we selected 25 regions with the highest intensity in the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) image and the 25 regions with the highest surface brightnesses in the pah 8  @xmath0 m image ( convolved with a kernel to match its psf to the psf of the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data ) .",
    "these regions were defined using the coordinate system of the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data ; each region is 3  pixels @xmath9 3  pixels in the co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data ( 21.8  arcsec @xmath9 21.8  arcsec or 330 pc @xmath9 330 pc ) .",
    "some of the regions overlap , and some regions are not centered on peak - like emission but instead selected to attempt to cover resolved structures .",
    "the regions were also selected to avoid locations that may have been severely affected by foreground stars .",
    "any locations that were affected by foreground stars in the pah 8  @xmath0 m data were blanked out in both data sets before surface brightnesses were extracted .",
    "these regions are shown in figure  [ f_pahvsco_reg ] .",
    "the extracted surface brightnesses are plotted in figure  [ f_pahvsco ] .",
    "the relation between co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0 m surface brightness differs between the two sets of data , demonstrating the presence of regions bright in one band but not the other .",
    "the regions selected in the pah 8  @xmath0 m data exhibit virtually no correlation ; the pearson s correlation coefficient for these data is 0.07 .",
    "the regions selected in the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) data do exhibit a weak correlation ; the data have a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0.32 .",
    "given that the square of the pearson s correlation coefficient indicates the fraction of variation in one variable that can be accounted for by a best fit line between the data , we find that , in the co - selected data , only @xmath99% of the variation observed in one band can be accounted for by a relation with the other band . in the pah  8@xmath0m - selected data , @xmath100% of the variation in one band can be accounted for by a relation with the other band .",
    "we therefore conclude that , at best , pah 8  @xmath0 m emission is only weakly correlated with co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission on scales of 330  pc within this galaxy , even though the radial profiles have very similar scale lengths .",
    "we can reject a couple of possible scenarios that would explain why the radial profiles for the pah  @xmath0 m and co @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission should match even while the emission mechanisms are not correlated on smaller spatial scales .",
    "first of all , pahs and co do not share a common origin .",
    "pahs are thought to form in the atmospheres of or outflows from agb stars or in interstellar shocks @xcite , while molecular gas is commonly assumed to form on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely that the radial profiles are matched through the schmidt law , which relates star formation to gas surface density @xcite .",
    "while star formation is strongly dependent on molecular gas surface densities in subregions within galaxies @xcite , pah emission is not strongly linked to other star formation tracers on sub - kpc scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that the ratio of pah 8  @xmath0 m emission to 24  @xmath0 m emission ( which has been shown to be correlated with other star formation tracers ) decreases as a function of radius within ngc  2403 , and the ratio of pah 8  @xmath0 m emission to other star formation tracers would be expected to vary similarly",
    ".    on possible link between pah and co emission is possible if molecular cloud formation is triggered in regions with stellar potential wells as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the new molecular clouds would produce co emission .",
    "additionally , the increased starlight in these potential wells ( from both the stars originally present in the wells and new stars formed from the molecular clouds ) would heat the diffuse ism . according to the results from @xcite ,",
    "enhanced pah emission will be produced by locations where the interstellar radiation field has increased .",
    "therefore , the stellar potential wells that form molecular gas clouds in this scenario would not only enhance co emission but also enhance pah emission , thus linking the two on large spatial scales and resulting in radial profiles that appear similar for both wave bands .",
    "however , the enhanced pah emission does not need to occur within the stellar potential wells but could instead occur in regions surrounding the potential wells .",
    "therefore , regions containing molecular gas could exhibit co emission correlated with pah emission while regions without molecular gas would exhibit pah emission that is uncorrelated with co emission as shown in figure  [ f_pahvsco ] .",
    "it is also possible that both pah and co emission are affected by similar excitation mechanisms .",
    "as stated above , enhancements in pah emission may be indicative of increased heating of the diffuse ism , which could be caused by enhancing star formation activity ( although they still declared that pah emission was not useful for tracing star formation on sub - kpc scales ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite postulated based on the comparison of co radial profiles to other star formation tracers that co could be excited by the cosmic rays from star formation , and cosmic rays tend to diffuse into the ism as can be seen by the comparisons of infrared and radio continuum emission performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "therefore , increases in star formation could enhance both pah and co emission on large spatial scales , which would explain why the radial profiles for pah and co emission appear to match each other .",
    "it is also possible that the radial profiles of co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) and pah 8  @xmath0 m emission are similar simply by coincidence .",
    "the radial profiles of both normalized by the total gas surface density are expected to decrease with radius , although for different reasons .",
    "perhaps the multiplicative factors that relate the slope of the co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profile to that of total gas surface density just happen to match those factors that relate the pah 8  @xmath0 m radial profile to that for total gas surface density , at least in this galaxy and the ones studied by @xcite .",
    "a more extensive investigation using the whole of the jcmt ngls sample could potentially reveal galaxies where the pah 8  @xmath0 m and co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profiles are not similar ( i.e. where the radial profiles do not have similar exponential scale lengths ) . if a sufficient number of such galaxies can be identified",
    ", then it would indicate that what was found here was merely a coincidence .",
    "we find that the dust surface density depends on the total ( atomic and molecular ) gas surface density and on radius .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio varies from @xmath3 in the nucleus to @xmath4 at 5.5  kpc , which is the limit at which the dust surface densities can be detected .",
    "the logarithm of the slope for the gas - to - dust ratio ( @xmath91 ) ) , which is @xmath101  dex  kpc@xmath12 , is very close to the slope in 12+log(o / h ) , which is usually reported as between -0.07 to -0.09  dex  kpc@xmath12 .",
    "this implies that the gas - to - dust ratio is strongly dependent on metallicity .",
    "additional abundance variations , such as variations in the c / o ratio , could explain the small disparity between @xmath91 and 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "aside from these strong radial variations in the gas - to - dust ratio , the ratio does not appear to vary within the galaxy .",
    "we also find that the pah 8  @xmath0 m and co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) radial profiles have statistically identical scale lengths . on spatial scales of 220  pc , however , pah 8  @xmath0 m and co  @xmath1=(3 - 2 ) emission are uncorrelated .",
    "we propose two mechanisms that could link the pah emission with star formation .",
    "first , the co emission may appear associated with pah emission if molecular cloud formation is triggered by stellar potential wells .",
    "the stars in these potential wells would enhance the radiation field that heats the diffuse ism , which would enhance pah emission .",
    "thus , the pah emission would appear associated with co emission on large scales but not on small scales .",
    "second , the two wave bands may be related through different excitation mechanisms that are linked through star formation and that affect the ism on large areas .",
    "while pah emission does not trace star formation on sub - kpc scales , it is expected to be enhanced by increases in the interstellar radiation field that accompany enhanced star formation . meanwhile , co emission could be enhanced by the increase in cosmic rays that accompanies enhanced star formation .",
    "thus , radially - averaged pah and co emission would both be linked through star formation , even though pah and co emission may not be spatially correlated on sub - kpc scales .",
    "however , we also do not rule out the possibility that the may just coincidentally have radial profiles with similar scale lengths .",
    "this paper is only a first look at the gas - to - dust ratio and the relation between pah and co emission within the jcmt ngls sample .",
    "the sings , things , and jcmt ngls samples were all selected to contain many of the same galaxies .",
    "the subset of galaxies found in all three samples can be used for an extended comparison of dust , molecular gas , and atomic gas surface densities and for comparisons of pah to co emission . moreover , the gradients in the gas - to - dust ratio could then be compared to abundance gradients to examine the relation between the two further .",

    "unfortunately , the quality of the submillimetre data used in these studies were quite variable , so it may not have been feasible for @xcite and @xcite to detect submillimetre emission in excess of what is expected from @xmath102  k dust within most galaxies . a few groups using very high signal - to - noise submillimetre data with iso or _ spitzer _",
    "data have conclusively demonstrated the presence of emission at wavelengths @xmath103  @xmath0 m in excess of what is expected from @xmath2  k dust within the milky way galaxy @xcite , ngc  4631 @xcite , ngc  3310 @xcite , and a few nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite have suggested that this represents emission from a high mass of dust at 5 - 10  k , most other authors have rejected this explanation because it leads to implausibly low gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "alternatively , the submillimetre emissivity of dust may be enhanced above the @xmath26 emissivity law commonly used in many dust models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such dust would include grains with exotic shapes , such as fractal dust grains , which would have relatively high submillimetre emissivities relative to their absorption cross sections @xcite ; dust in which resonances from impurities in the dust grains enhances the submillimetre emissivity @xcite ; or grains with shallow dust emissivities ( @xmath104 , with @xmath105 ) that would only be visible at submillimetre wavelengths @xcite .",
    "additionally , laboratory studies @xcite and at least one theoretical study @xcite have shown that dust grains exhibit a broad range of emissivities at these wavelength and that submillimetre dust emissivities can be strongly enhanced above the @xmath26 emissivity function that is commonly used in astronomical research . in all of these alternate scenarios ,",
    "the mass of the dust that produces the excess submillimetre emission is relatively low , and most of the dust mass should be traced by dust that dominates the sed at @xmath106  @xmath0 m .",
    "moreover , the results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have demonstrated that , based on the total gas content and expected gas - to - dust ratios for nearby galaxies , most of the dust mass in nearby galaxies can be accounted for by @xmath107  k dust emitting at @xmath108  @xmath0 m .",
    "it is always possible that newer @xmath109  @xmath0 m data from either the _ herschel _ space observatory or scuba2 on the jcmt along with improved dust models could demonstrate that the use of _ spitzer _ data alone will lead to significant underestimates of dust masses .",
