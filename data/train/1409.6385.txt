    "a substantial percentage of disk galaxies at low redshift is known to host stellar bars ( e.g. de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "these prominent non - axisymmetric structures are believed to have an important influence on galaxy evolution , such as redistributing mass and angular momentum between the constituents of the galaxies ( friedli & benz 1993 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "2006 ) , promoting the formation of spiral arms and rings ( lindblad 1960 ; toomre 1969 ; sanders & huntley 1976 ; schwarz 1981 ) , fueling gas to the centers of the galaxies ( shlosman et al . 1989 ; friedli & benz 1993 ) , and helping in the build - up of pseudo - bulges ( sheth et al .",
    "2005 ; laurikainen et al . 2007 ; okamoto 2013 ) .    just as bars act as major agents of secular evolution of their hosting galaxies ( athanassoula 2013 ; cheung et al .",
    "2013 ; sellwood 2014 ) , the internal physical characteristics of their hosting galaxies play a major role in determining the presence and evolution of bars . using extensive samples of galaxies , at both low and at high redshifts , a number of important studies have examined the dependence of the disk bar fraction ( @xmath7 ) on different physical properties . while some early studies ( aguerri et al .",
    "2009 ; barazza et al .",
    "2009 ) found that bars are mostly located in blue , low concentrated galaxies with low luminosities and masses , more recent studies report the opposite .",
    "in general , the fraction of barred galaxies is higher in luminous , more massive galaxies , than in their less massive , fainter counterparts ( nair & abraham 2010 ; lee+12 ; masters et al .",
    "2012 ; oh et al . 2012 ; wang et al .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the bar fraction is also found as a function of galaxy color ; with the bar fraction increasing considerably when moving from blue to red systems ( nair & abraham 2010 ; masters et al .",
    "2011 ; lee+12 ; oh et al .",
    ". masters et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported a lower bar fraction in gas - rich disk galaxies than gas - poor ones , and wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that galaxies with strong bars present an enhanced central star formation rate or a star formation rate that is suppressed when compared to the mean , highlighting the important role that bars have in the quenching of star formation .",
    "finally , the bar fraction is higher and the bars are longer in early - type spirals , with more prominent bulges and higher concentrations , than in late - type spirals ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ; martin 1995 ; erwin 2005 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2007 ; hoyle et al . 2011 )    in regards to the formation of bars in disk galaxies , the halos in which these galaxies are embedded play a major role .",
    "according to the early simulations by ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) , a cold stellar disk will experience bar instabilities if the ratio of total kinetic energy to the total potential energy exceeds 0.14 .",
    "the presence of a massive halo , supported by random orbital motions , helps to stabilize the disk by increasing the potential energy , being more efficient a large halo than a centrally concentrated one ( hohl 1976 ) .",
    "efstathiou et al . ( 1982 ) reached a similar conclusion studying a set of n - body simulations and proposing a stability criterion that requires a massive halo component to provide stability against bar formation ( see also christodoulou et al .",
    "this same stability criterion is reported ( yurin & springel 2014 ) to be a good predictor for the formation of bar in the full cosmological contex .",
    "the inclusion of other components , such as bulges , diminished the importance of the stabilizing effect of the halo ( athanassoula & sellwood 1986 ) .",
    "however , athanassoula ( 2002 , 2003 ) found stronger bars in halo - dominated models than in their disk - dominated counterparts when a live halo is implemented .",
    "more recently , debuhr et al . (",
    "2012 ) studied gravitational interactions between live stellar disks and their dark matter halos , finding the stellar - to - halo mass ratio to be a primary factor to follow bar formation and evolution , with systems showing stronger stability against bar formation in lower mass disks for a given halo mass .",
    "an interesting case of study in this regard are low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb ) , that are expected to be stable against bar formation due to low disk self - gravity and high dark matter content .",
    "numerical experiments trying to simulate the formation of bars in such systems face difficulties due to the low disk masses and if they are successful , the bars they generate are small and unstable , leading to the formation of bulge - like structures ( mihos et al . 1997 ; mayer & wadsley 2004 ) .",
    "halo shape has also repercussion on the fate of stellar bars . when compared with axisymmetric halos , triaxial halos",
    "induce early bar formation ( athanassoula et al . 2013 ) , but at later stages damp the growth and strengthening of the bar ( berentzen et al 2006 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "only recently , numerical simulations have addressed the influence of rotating halos in the formation and growth of bars ( saha & naab 2013 ; long et al .",
    "2014 ) , finding that spinning halos promote bar formation , but their growth in size and strength gets quenched with increasing spin , explaining why @xmath7 decreases with increasing @xmath8 ( cervantes - sodi , et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "recently , there have been several works studying the environmental dependence of barred galaxies .",
    "when the environment is characterized in terms of the distance to the nearest neighbor , the likelihood of galaxies hosting bars shows a systematic decrease as the distance decreases ( lee+12 ; casteels et al .",
    "2013 ; lin et al .",
    "2014 ) , suggesting that close encounters suppress the formation of bars and/or destroy them .",
    "if the local environmental density is considered , most of the studies show an independence of barred galaxies with environment ( giordano et al .",
    "2010 ; martnez & mriel 2011 ; lee+12 ; marinova et al .",

    "is reported by lin et al ( 2014 ) for the case of their early - type barred galaxies , that are more strongly clustered on scales from a few 100 kpc up to 1 mpc , than the unbarred early - type galaxies .    in this paper",

    "the original catalog contains 33,391 galaxies that are classified into early ( e / s0 ) and late ( sa to sd ) types by segregating them in the color vs. color gradient and concentration index planes ( park & choi 2005 ) plus an additional visual inspection .",
    "the identification of stellar bars is done by visual inspection of @xmath19 combined color images from the sdss website using _ visual tools_. to avoid selection biases by inclination , the sample of late - type galaxies is limited to systems with @xmath20-band isophotal axis ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes . from this requirement",
    "we restrict our study to 10,674 late - type galaxies .",
    "when a stellar bar is identified , it is further classified as a strong bar if it is larger than one quarter of the size of their host galaxies , or as a weak bar otherwise .",

    "a more interesting feature to explore is the dependence of the bar fraction on the stellar - to - halo mass fraction .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fractions](c ) , for the case of strong bars , galaxies with high m@xmath0m@xmath1 ratios ( @xmath29 ) have much higher bar fraction than systems that are more dominated by dark matter .",

    "it is interesting to check if this dependence is visible at fixed stellar mass . in the top panels of figure  [ maps ] we present the bar fraction in the m@xmath1 vs. m@xmath2 plane , for the full sample of barred galaxies ( strong plus weak bars , left panel ) , and strong ( central panel ) and weak ( right panel )",

    "we use a spline kernel to get a smooth transition of @xmath7 , dividing the parameter space into 20 @xmath30 20 bins , and requiring at least 15 galaxies per bin to estimate the bar fraction . the first thing to note",
    "is that even at fixed stellar mass , there is a strong variation of @xmath7 with halo mass , and the dependence is particularly clear for the case of strong bars , with f@xmath31 increasing with decreasing m@xmath1 at fixed m@xmath2 , although the dependence is more dramatic fixing the halo mass and looking at the increase of @xmath7 with increasing stellar mass .",
    "weak bars are found in galaxies with low m@xmath2 and m@xmath1 values .    for the cases of the full sample and the restricted subsample of strong bars , we find that the bar fraction presents a secondary maximum at high halo mass ( @xmath32 ) , but relatively low stellar mass ( @xmath33 )",
    ". these systems are actually central galaxies of rich groups , where the stellar mass refers to the central galaxy only , but the total halo mass refers to the mass of the parent halo plus the satellite systems . in this sense",
    ", the value obtained through our estimate for the m@xmath0m@xmath1 represents only a lower value or the real one . besides , in these rich groups , other mechanisms might be taking place changing the likelihood of galaxies hosting bars .    with the most massive galaxies populating the most massive halos and at the same time being in general redder and with a higher m@xmath0m@xmath1 than less massive galaxies , it is important to check if the dependence of the bar fraction on m@xmath0m@xmath1 is not only a reflection of the dependence of m@xmath0m@xmath1 on color .",

    "it is evident that the dependence is stronger with m@xmath0m@xmath1 than with @xmath36 , but still at fixed m@xmath0m@xmath1 there is a variation of the bar fraction with the spin parameter . for the case of strong bars ( middle panel ) with low to intermediate values of m@xmath0m@xmath1 , at fixed m@xmath0m@xmath1 the bar fraction increases for decreasing @xmath36 , while strong bars with heavy stellar disks appear to be more frequently found on high spinning galaxies .",
    "as discussed in paper i , we expect galaxies with low spin values to be more prone to develop bar instabilities due to their self - gravitation , while high spinning galaxies are more extended with sparse disks that suppress and/or damp global instabilities .",
    "this naturally explains the behavior found in light disks , but disks with high stellar - to - halo mass ratios are already massive enough to develop bar instabilities . for these systems with heavy disks in relation to their halos , the increase of @xmath36 prevents them for becoming supported by random motions instead of ordered rotation which in turn increases the formation / growth of bars , hence the increase of @xmath7 with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "weak bars ( figure  [ maps ] , bottom right panel ) have their maximum occurrence at low m@xmath0m@xmath1 ratios and high @xmath36 values , in agreement with recent numerical experiments ( debuhr et al .",

    "this simple analysis presents the same functional dependence we obtain from our observational sample and tells us that it comes from the different density distributions of dark matter and stars , and reflects the stabilizing effect the halo provides to the disk of stars against bar formation .    for completeness",
    ", we also explore the behavior of @xmath7 in two - dimensional planes , choosing one of the axes to be m@xmath6m@xmath1 , to check if at fixed m@xmath6m@xmath1 we can still find a dependence of the bar fraction on other physical parameters .",
    "our result is presented in figure  [ maps2 ] .",
    "we can see that in all cases ( stellar mass , color and spin ) , the color contours denoting the bar fraction are almost entirely horizontal in the areas most densely populated by galaxies , implying that the bar fraction at fixed m@xmath6m@xmath1 is practically independent of stellar mass , color , and spin where the bulk of the galaxy population resides .",
    "this independence is particularly interesting for the case of color , for which previous studies have always found a strong dependence , even after fixing other quantities ; i.e. nair & abraham ( 2010 ) found that , at fixed color , the bar fraction still presents a dependence on stellar mass and morphological type ; masters et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found a dependence of the bar fraction on color at fixed absolute magnitude , and fixing the color they also found a dependence on the gas mass fraction ; and lee+12 found a dependence on @xmath34 color at fixed absolute @xmath48magnitude , concentration index , and velocity dispersion .",
    "our result using central galaxies indicates , contrary to previous findings , that at fixed m@xmath6m@xmath1 , the dependence of the bar fraction on color becomes much weaker , with the only exception of extreme red galaxies with @xmath49 .",

    "if we instead look at the bar fraction as a function of @xmath26 color ( same figure right column ) , the difference between satellites and centrals vanishes .",
    "this can be explained with the satellite population being on average redder at fixed stellar mass than the subsample of central galaxies , this due to the harsh group environment where they experience gas stripping ( skibba 2009 ; kimm et al .",

    ", once m@xmath6m@xmath1 is fixed , the dependence of the bar fraction on stellar mass , color , and spin becomes very weak , with the only exception of galaxies with extreme red colors .    by comparing the bar fraction for central and satellite systems at fixed stellar mass",

    "<S> we use a large volume - limited sample of disk galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 to study the dependence of the bar fraction on the stellar - to - halo mass ratio , making use of a group catalog , we identify central and satellite galaxies in our sample . for the central galaxies in the sample we estimate the stellar - to - halo mass ratio ( m@xmath0m@xmath1 ) and find that the fraction of barred galaxies is a strong function of this ratio , especially for the case of strong bars . </S>",
    "<S> bars are more common in galaxies with high m@xmath0m@xmath1 values , as expected from early theoretical works that showed that systems with massive dark matter halos are more stable against bar instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the change of the bar fraction with m@xmath1 and m@xmath2 is stronger if we consider a relation with the form @xmath3(m@xmath4m@xmath1 ) with @xmath5 , and that the bar fraction is largely independent of other physical properties such as color and spin parameter when m@xmath6m@xmath1 is fixed . with our sample of galaxies segregated into centrals and satellites </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the fraction of barred galaxies in each group , finding a slightly higher bar fraction for satellites when compared with centrals at fixed stellar mass , but at fixed color this difference becomes very weak . </S>",
    "<S> this result , in agreement with previous studies , confirms that the bar fraction does not directly depend on the group / cluster environment , but the dependence exists through its dependence on internal morphology . </S>"
