    "namely , in the expression for @xmath537 we have the absolute value of a vandermonde determinant , while in the expression for @xmath235 we have the modulus squared of a vandermonde determinant . in the latter case , we may treat @xmath559 uniformly for each @xmath560 by writing @xmath561 we do not have this luxury when working with @xmath537 . for every @xmath562 , @xmath563 is a complex number which is either real or purely imaginary , and we must treat each @xmath564 differently based on whether @xmath565 is real and positive , real and negative , on the positive imaginary axis or on the negative imaginary axis .",
    "it is at this key point that our evaluation of @xmath150 diverges from the evaluation of @xmath156 given by chern and vaaler .",

    "so far we have only used the multiplicativity of @xmath8 to produce a product over the roots of a polynomial . to exploit the appearance of this product",

    "* lemma 3.1 ) for details ) .",

    "returning to @xmath537 let us see how the pfaffian arises in the formulation of @xmath150 . to do this we will use the familiar formula for the vandermonde determinant given by @xmath580setting @xmath581 we can use ( [ eq:12 ] ) to determine whether @xmath582 is on the positive real axis , negative real axis , positive imaginary axis or negative imaginary axis . in lemma  [ lemma:5 ]",

    "when @xmath539 is even , we have the very important identity ( lemma  [ lemma:6 ] ) @xmath587 when @xmath4 is even so is @xmath539 , and thus in this situation , @xmath588 in the case when @xmath4 ( and hence @xmath539 ) is odd we will need to modify our approach since the pfaffian is only defined for even by even square antisymmetric matrices .",
    "the point of this section is to see the general mechanism which produces the pfaffian structure in @xmath305 ; for now we will assume that we are in the easier case where @xmath4 is even .    substituting ( [ eq:13 ] ) into ( [ eq:11 ] ) allows us to write @xmath589 at first glance this does not look to be much of an improvement over ( [ eq:11 ] ) , however the pfaffian admits an expansion as a sum over @xmath289 similar to that of the determinant ( equation  [ eq:52 ] ) .",
    "this expansion together with the laplace expansion of @xmath590 ( using minors which depend only on @xmath591 or @xmath592 ) will allow us to separate this expression into a sum over complementary minors whose summand is the product of two integrals : one over @xmath593 and the other over @xmath594 .",

    "the evaluation of these integrals is again dependent on fubini s theorem .",
    "the combinatorics necessary to reduce the resulting sum of products of pfaffians of antisymmetric matrices to the formula given in theorem [ thm:5 ] is achieved using a combinatorial formula for the pfaffian of a sum of antisymmetric matrices .",
