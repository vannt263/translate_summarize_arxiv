    "non - hermitian hamiltonians satisfying the parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetry can have real eigenvalues  @xcite . while originally these ideas were developed in the quantum - mechanical context , it became soon clear that new broad applications they can find in optics .",
    "the first suggestions of the optical analogues of the @xmath1 symmetric hamiltonians was proposed in  @xcite and was based on a linear planar waveguide structure .",
    "@xmath1 symmetry effect predictions are confirmed in experiments with light propagation in couplers with gain and loss  @xcite .",
    "later on it was suggested to explore nonlinear optical media obeying @xmath1-symmetry , and in particular it was shown the possibility of soliton propagation in such media  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-symmetry was modeled by the refractive index having symmetric real part and anti - symmetric imaginary part .",
    "a particularly interesting realization of a @xmath1 symmetric modulation of the refractive index is when losses and gain are localized in space , giving rise to a @xmath1 symmetric localized impurity .",
    "such impurities allow for existence of localized ( defect ) modes . in the linear theory",
    "such modes were studied for exactly integrable models in  @xcite , and their nonlinear extension was reported in  @xcite .",
    "solitons supported by other @xmath1 symmetric defects were also reported for focusing  @xcite and defocusing  @xcite media . linear scattering by a @xmath1-symmetric inhomogeneity and emerging of the related spectral singularities was described in  @xcite .",
    "the effect of two and various randomly distributed @xmath1 symmetric impurities on the lattice dynamics was addressed in  @xcite .",
    "switching of solitons in a unidirectional coupler using @xmath1-symmetric defects was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear modes in even more sophisticated , double well @xmath1-symmetric potentials were studied recently  @xcite .",
    "all of the works mentioned above and devoted to nonlinear modes dealt with the pt symmetric media possessing kerr nonlinearity ( see the list of recent works on solitons in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is a natural further step to address a possibility of existence of defect modes and their stability in another class of widely used optical media , which is are the @xmath2 materials .",
    "solitons in quadratic nonlinear media with conservative defects were investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that solutions are dynamically stable in the case of attractive impurities . in the present paper",
    "we study the existence of solitons in the media with quadratic nonlinearity and localized @xmath1-symmetric potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the model and statement of the problem are formulated .",
    "the properties of localized modes for different ratios between fundamental and second harmonics are studied in sections iii - v .",
    "the stability and dynamics of localized solutions are considered in section vi .",
    "we consider the system    [ final ] @xmath3    describing spatial second - harmonic generation in a @xmath2 material with localized modulation of the refractive index , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the dimensionless fields of the first and second harmonics , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dimensionless transverse and propagation coordinates , scaled to the characteristic size of the modulation of the refractive index which is characterized by the amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the mismatch in the propagation constants of field components is described by @xmath9 .",
    "we notice that experimentally the introduced model can describe a medium with active dopants , typically having rather narrow spectral resonances , i.e. affecting only a limited range of frequencies .",
    "in particular , such impurities can induce gain and dissipation , whose strengths is characterized by @xmath10 , only for one of the field component , which in our case is the ff .    before into the detail study of the system ( [ final ] ) we note , that in the standard way solitonic solutions can be found in the analytical form in the limit of large mismatch parameter @xmath11 , when @xmath12 and the system ( [ final ] ) reduces to the nls equation with pt - symmetric potential for the fundamental harmonic @xmath4 @xmath13 for @xmath14 the bright soliton solution has the form  @xcite @xmath15 , \\nonumber\\\\ a = ( 2-v+\\frac{\\alpha^2 v^2}{9})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we are interested in the localized solutions @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the propagation constant of the first harmonic and @xmath18 solves the system    [ stat]@xmath19   w_{1}+ 2\\overline{w}_{1}w_{2 } = 0,\\label{stat1}\\ ] ] @xmath20    subject to the zero boundary conditions @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "we restrict our consideration mainly to solutions bifurcating from the linear limit , which is understood as a limit where at least one of the harmonics vanishes .",
    "it follows from ( [ stat ] ) , that so defined linear limit does not necessarily implies that both amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath24 are infinitely small .",
    "indeed it is sufficient to require that only the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic @xmath23 is infinitely small to consider the equations ( [ stat ] ) in the linear limit .",
    "that is why one can distinguish three different bifurcations of the fundamental soliton solution from the linear limit :    \\(i ) the amplitude of the second harmonic is of the order of the squared amplitude of the first harmonic ,",
    "i.e. is negligible compared to the amplitude of the first harmonic @xmath25    \\(ii ) the second harmonic is finite in the limit of negligible first harmonic @xmath26    \\(iii ) both harmonics are of the same order @xmath27    as it follows from ( [ case1 ] ) and ( [ case3 ] ) the maximal intensities of both @xmath23 and @xmath24 go to zero at the bifurcation point for cases ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "however in case ( ii ) the maximum of the absolute value of field @xmath24 goes to a finite value when the solution approaches the bifurcation point .",
    "which of the cases is realized , depends on the parameters of the system , and in particular on the mismatch @xmath9 .",
    "below we consider these three cases separately .",
    "let us start with the conditions necessary for ( [ case1 ] ) to occur . in this limit the nonlinear term in ( [ stat1 ] ) can be neglected and in the leading order we have the eigenvalue problem    @xmath28    @xmath29    [ lin1 ]    eq .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) has been studied before .",
    "therefore below we only briefly outline the features necessary for our analysis , referring to  @xcite for more details .    for @xmath30",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) possesses localized solutions .",
    "when @xmath10 is below the @xmath1-symmetry breaking threshold @xmath31 the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) has discrete real eigenvalues given by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 above the symmetry breaking point ( @xmath34 ) the eigenvalues of the bound states are complex valued .",
    "we notice here that no fundamental branch satisfying condition ( [ case1 ] ) with @xmath34 was found .",
    "therefore from now on we concentrate only on the results for @xmath1-symmetry preserving case ( [ pt - breaking ] ) . moreover , our consideration will be limited to nonlinear modes that bifurcate from the ground state of defect potential in eq .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath35 . the respective eigenstate of the linear problem ( [ lin1 ] ) reads  @xcite @xmath36 \\label{w1lpt}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a constant and @xmath38    passing to ( [ stat2 ] ) , in the small amplitude limit one can look for a solution with @xmath39 , which plays the role of the inhomogeneous term in the linear equation for @xmath24 . however , to obtain the complete families of solutions one has to consider both eqs .",
    "( [ stat ] ) .",

    "we note that in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : solutionsalpha144 ] the solution has a relatively small amplitude .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the chosen strength of the potential ( it was @xmath54 , solitons with larger amplitudes were found to be unstable ) . while this potential ( ensuring the existence of only one linear defect level in the localized potential ) is used below along the text , in the right panels of fig .

    "this leads to the requirement that @xmath63 and consequently @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction of @xmath65 reads @xmath66 where @xmath67 is some constant which must be determined .",
