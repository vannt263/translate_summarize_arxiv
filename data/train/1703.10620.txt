    "although schrdinger introduced@xcite the term _ entanglement _ to quantum mechanics in 1935,@xcite most physicists did not begin using the term until the 1990s or later .",
    "even today there are quantum mechanics textbooks in use that do not use the word `` entanglement '' at all.@xcite more importantly , our teaching often glosses over the underlying concept : that for any quantum system with more than one degree of freedom , the vast majority of allowed states exhibit `` correlations '' or `` non - separability . ''    when we finally introduce students to entangled states , it is usually in the context of spin systems , such as the singlet state of a pair of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "this example is unparalleled for its mathematical simplicity and direct applicability to bell s theorem and quantum information science .",
    "however , spin systems are also rather abstract and disconnected from the spatial wave functions that are more familiar to most students .",
    "students also encounter entangled wave functions when they apply quantum mechanics to atoms , but there the concept of entanglement tends to get muddied by the complications of three spatial dimensions and identical particles .",
    "moreover , neither entangled spins nor entangled atomic wave functions are easy to visualize .",
    "fortunately , it is easy to include simple pictorial examples of entangled spatial wave functions in any course that discusses wave functions : an upper - division quantum mechanics course , a sophomore - level modern physics course , and in many cases an introductory physics course .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate some ways of doing so .",
    "the following section introduces non - separable wave functions for a single particle in two dimensions .",
    "section  iii then reinterprets these same functions for a system of two particles in one dimension .",
    "section iv explains how entanglement arises from interactions between particles , and sec .",
    "v shows how to quantify the degree of entanglement for a two - particle wave function .",
    "each of these sections ends with a few short exercises@xcite to help students develop a conceptual understanding of entanglement .",
    "the appendix reviews some of the history of how the term `` entanglement '' finally came into widespread use , more than a half century after schrdinger coined it .",
    "and @xmath0 .",
    "positive and negative portions of the wave function are indicated by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 symbols , and by color online ; black represents a value of zero . this wave function factors into a function of @xmath3 and a function of  @xmath4 , drawn along the top and right . ]",
    "imagine that you are teaching quantum mechanics to undergraduates and you have just finished covering wave mechanics in one dimension .",
    "the natural next step is to explore wave mechanics in multiple dimensions , and a typical first example@xcite is the two - dimensional square infinite square",
    "well , with potential energy @xmath5 inside this idealized potential well the separable solutions to the time - independent schrdinger equation are @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive integer quantum numbers . the corresponding energies , assuming the particle is nonrelativistic , are proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ box23plot ] shows one of these wave functions .    after listing the allowed energies and perhaps drawing some of the separable wave functions , it is customary@xcite to put this problem aside and go on to the next example ",
    "perhaps a three - dimensional infinite square well , or a central force problem .",
    "typically these further examples also admit separable solutions , and so our students run the risk of acquiring a serious misconception :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * misconception 1 : * all multidimensional wave functions are separable . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    although i am not aware of any physics education research that documents the prevalence of this misconception , i think most of us who have taught quantum mechanics have encountered it",
    ". often students do understand that in order for the time - independent schrdinger equation to have separable solutions the potential energy function must have a good deal of symmetry .",
    "but as long as there is enough symmetry for separable solutions to exist , few students will spontaneously realize that these are not all the allowed wave functions .",
    "of course , mature physicists could never suffer from misconception  1 .",
    "we know that quantum states live in a vector space , where every normalized linear combination of two or more allowed states is also an allowed state",
    ". the separable wave functions of eq .",
    "( [ separablepsi ] ) are merely a set of basis states , from which all the others can be built . but beginning students of quantum physics know none of this .",
    "many of them lack the vocabulary to even say it .    whether or not students know about vector spaces and orthonormal bases , it is easy enough to show them examples of superposition states.@xcite figure  [ boxnonseparableplots](a ) shows the state @xmath10 in which i have combined an admixture of the degenerate @xmath11 state with the @xmath12 state of fig .",

    "[ boxnonseparableplots](a ) and you measure its @xmath3 coordinate and happen to obtain @xmath15 , a subsequent measurement of @xmath4 is then considerably more likely to yield values near @xmath15 , and less likely to yield values near @xmath17 , than it was before you measured  @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the outcomes of the two measurements are correlated ; we could even say they are _",
    "entangled_although that word is usually reserved for systems of two or more distinct particles , as discussed in the following section .",
    "although the probability claims made in the previous paragraph should be fairly intuitive just from looking at the wave function density plots , they can also be quantified .",
    "if you measure @xmath4 before  @xmath3 , then you calculate the probability distribution for  @xmath4 by integrating the square of the wave function over all  @xmath3 : @xmath18 on the other hand , if you measure @xmath3 first and obtain the result @xmath19 , then you calculate the probability distribution for a subsequent measurement of  @xmath4 by setting @xmath20 in the wave function ( to `` collapse '' it along the measurement direction ) , renormalizing it , and then squaring : @xmath21 figure  [ beforeandafterdistributions ] compares these two probability distributions for the wave function shown in fig .",

    "figure [ boxnonseparableplots](c ) shows an even clearer example of non - separability : a `` cat state''@xcite consisting of two isolated peaks , one centered at coordinates @xmath13 and the other at @xmath14 .",
    "of course the completeness of the basis states guarantees that this state can be expressed as a linear combination of them , but if the goal is to understand non - separability ( or `` entanglement '' of @xmath3 and  @xmath4 ) , then there is no need to mention any basis or even to assume that this particle is inside an infinite square well . by inspection",
    "we can see that if a particle is in this cat state then a measurement of either @xmath3 or @xmath4 will have a 50 - 50 chance of giving a result near either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",

    "that it took roughly 60 years for the term `` entanglement '' to come into common use , after schrdinger introduced it in 1935 , is astonishing . explaining the long delay is a job for historians of science.@xcite here i will merely document some of the relevant publications and dates.@xcite    a convenient way to see the big picture is to use the google books ngram viewer@xcite to search for the phrase `` quantum entanglement .

    "the decisive year for `` entanglement '' was probably 1987 .",

    "that article was also included in the collected volume of bell s writings on quantum foundations that was published the same year , so it reached many other physicists .",
    "the subject of bell s article was the newly published ( 1986 ) `` spontaneous collapse '' proposal of ghirardi , rimini , and weber ( grw).@xcite the 1986 grw paper did not use the word `` entanglement , '' but these authors did use it in 1987 in an answer@xcite to a comment on their paper , and in this answer they cited bell s contribution to the schrdinger volume .",
    "this answer is the earliest use of the term that i can find in any of the physical review journals .    another year and a half passed before `` entanglement '' appeared in physical review letters , in a paper by horne , shimony , and zeilinger.@xcite by then",
