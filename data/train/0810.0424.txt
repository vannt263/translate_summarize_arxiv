    "a galaxy undergoing a period of rapid star formation that can not be maintained for its lifetime is known as a starburst galaxy .",
    "m82 , which is one of the closest known starburst galaxies ( 3.2mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is considered to be the archetypal example . at fir wavelengths ,",
    "starburst galaxies emit strongly , the emission arising from dust , heated by a population of early - type stars associated with the star formation @xcite",
    ". this large population of massive , rapidly evolving stars will produce an equally large number of supernovae .",
    "the central regions of the majority of starbursts suffer from high visual extinction , making optical detection of these supernovae or supernova remnants ( snr ) difficult .",
    "however , radio emission , which is unaffected by extinction , allows the central regions of these galaxies to be probed .",
    "the detected radio emission consists of both non - thermal ( synchrotron ) emission , arising from the acceleration of particles to relativistic speeds via supernova explosions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thermal free - free emission from regions .",
    "radio observations of m82 in 1975 @xcite revealed a number of compact sources in the central kpc , which were considered to be supernovae .",
    "however , with the exception of the source , 41.95 + 57.5 , whose flux density continues to decay ( see section [ notes ] ) , subsequent observations have shown a lack of variability in the flux densities of these sources which rule out the possibility of the majority of them being new radio supernovae and confirmed their identity as supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "subsequent radio studies of the central region of m82 with merlin ( multi element radio linked interferometry network ) and the vla ( very large array ) have resulted in the detection of over 50 discrete objects which are now known to represent a population of both snr and regions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and others ) .",
    "studies of extragalactic snrs have a number of advantages over similar galactic ones .",
    "firstly by the fact that the youngest known galactic snr , cassiopeia a , is over 300 years old , ( whereas the youngest known snr in m82 is effectively 40 years old @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the distances to galactic snrs are uncertain , but , although the relative distances of the snrs in m82 differ by @xmath0 few hundred parsecs , that is small compared with the overall distance of 3.2mpc so that they can effectively be treated as being at the same distance , thus providing a sample of supernova remnants that can be studied with essentially the same linear resolution and sensitivity .",
    "global vlbi observations , which have previously been used to monitor the expansion of two of the most compact sources in m82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) resolve out all but the most compact sources .",
    "hence , merlin is the ideal instrument for observations of this galaxy and this paper describes a merlin deep integration at 5ghz which provides high signal - to - noise ratios for the majority of the well resolved snrs in m82 . the naturally weighted sensitivity of @xmath017enables the study of larger , more diffuse , and by inference older , remnants amongst the snr and regions within the central kpc all of which are resolved in these 5ghz merlin observations .",
    "in [ msre ] , measurements of the expansions of ten snr from this sample , including eight for which this has not been done before , are presented .",
    "the resulting velocities range from 2200 to 10500 . in [ disc ] the population of sources observed as well as the cumulative distribution of the snrs and the flux density vs. diameter relation are discussed .",
    "these results , along with the star formation rates are used to investigate the discrepancy between the theoretical models of the snrs and interstellar medium within m82 ( [ ism ] ) , for example , the work of @xcite , and the results of the observations presented here .",
    "the 2002 deep integration was obtained using six of the merlin antennas , including the cambridge telescope . the observing strategy and",
    "correlator configuration replicated those used in the 1992 5ghz observations presented by @xcite .",
    "the 2002 observations were undertaken between the 1 and 28 april at a frequency of 4.994ghz using both ll and rr polarisations and with a bandwidth of 15mhz divided into 15 channels .",
    "the total on source integration time was over 175 hours .",
    "observations of the calibrator 3c286 were used to set the flux density scale and the point source calibrator oq208 was used to determine the passbands and relative gains of the antennas . a phase reference source , 0955 + 697 , was used to determine the telescope phases and the data were weighted appropriately according to the relative sensitivity of each merlin antenna . after applying phase corrections , the 2002 dataset was processed directly in the j2000 coordinate system using an updated position for the phase calibrator source , 0955 + 697 , derived from vlbi observations .    in order for a direct comparison to be made ,",
    "the 1992 dataset was precessed to j2000 coordinates and corrections were made to account for the revised position of the phase calibrator source .",
    "final astrometrical alignment of the two datasets was achieved by aligning the peak of the most compact source ( 41.95 + 57.5 ) as measured in the 1992 image with that in a preliminary 2002 image .",
    "the peaks of the other compact sources ( e.g. 44.01 + 59.6 and 43.31 + 59.2 ) were now found to be coincident to within 1mas .    following the alignment process both sets of data",
    "were imaged using the aips task imagr to produce four adjoining 1024@xmath11024 fields , initially using natural weighting and a cell - size of 15mas .",
    "the images were deconvolved using the hgbom cleaning algorithm @xcite and restored with a 50mas circular beam . the rms noise level in source",
    "free areas in the 2002 image was @xmath017@xmath2jy / beam , which was close to the expected noise level and a factor of @xmath03 improvement on the @xmath3jy / beam equivalent noise level in the 1992 images .",
    "subsequent images from both datasets were also produced using a variety of robustness parameters @xcite and in some cases smoothing .",
    "the robustness values ranged from @xmath43 to + 3 with corresponding beam sizes ranging from 35 to 50mas .",
    "a summary of the imaging parameters used is given in table [ params ] .",
    "a uniformly weighted image was also produced and restored with a 35mas circular beam .",
    "as individual sources within m82 vary dramatically in nature with some being very bright and compact , whilst others are weak and more extended , the imaging parameters were adjusted to obtain the most suitable image for each source .",

    "also included are sizes and limits for sources detected by vlbi observations , including sn1993j @xcite and snr from arp220 @xcite .",
    "the galactic and lmc source flux densities have been extrapolated to 5ghz using the spectral indices presented in the literature , and the diameters of all the sources have been scaled to the distance of m82 . for the m82 snrs , there appears to be a relationship of the form , @xmath12 , ( shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ surfb ] ) , whereas the general trend for all of the snrs indicates a somewhat steeper relationship .",
    "however , this latter trend is subject to considerable error because of the uncertainties in the distance estimates for the galactic snrs .",
    "the overlap in the samples plotted show that , whilst the m82 snrs are more luminous and compact , they appear to belong to the same class of objects as the snrs found in our own galaxy .",
    "this 5-ghz flux density - diameter relationship is most strongly restricted at the lower limit which is heavily affected by the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "the increased sensitivity of the 2002 deep observations has reduced this effect and enabled a more accurate determination of this lower limit .    it should be noted that up to 40 per cent of the flux of the more extended sources could have been resolved out by merlin because of its @xmath13 km shortest baseline length . on the other hand",
    ", this spatial frequency filtering means that very extended background emission , which makes it difficult to measure flux densities of individual sources with the vla , will have been mostly resolved out by merlin .",
    "although the comparison with galactic and other extragalactic snrs will be somewhat affected by resolution , the effects on the observed scatter is likely to be comparably small .",
    "the continued decay in the flux density of the snr , 41.95 + 57.5 , between 1992 and 2002 ( see section [ notes ] ) means that its position in the plots shown in fig .",
    "[ surfb ] is changing .",
    "the snr included from observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp220 are clearly much more luminous than those found in m82 .",
    "the sample includes seven sources taken from @xcite , six of which are plotted with upper limits in diameter as they are unresolved , and one of which has a measured size of 0.86pc .",
    "these seven sources are labelled as l class sources in @xcite as they are at least 11 years old and have very small or no measured decay in flux density .",
    "these sources are therefore cited as likely snr within arp220 .        the surface brightness ( @xmath14 ) of the 38 snrs",
    "have also been plotted in fig .",
    "[ surfb ] as a function of their diameter , d , assuming that the largest angular size approximates the diameter where no clear shell structure has been identified .",
    "this ` @xmath14-d ' relationship has often been used to study snr populations @xcite , although it can give a false impression of a correlation ( effectively plotting 1/@xmath15 versus d ) and should therefore , be treated with caution .",
    "the uncertainties in distance measurements for galactic snrs also make its use in such an analysis inappropriate .",
    "however , as the relative distances to the m82 snrs are known to within @xmath01 per cent , this relationship can be sensibly considered and is therefore included .",
    "the observed scatter in the m82 snr population , ( unattributable to errors in the distance estimates ) is at least partially explained by differences in the ambient density associated with each snr , a hypothesis supported by the variety of expansion velocities observed ( see section [ msre ] ) .",
    "the same selection effects that affect the 5ghz flux density plot also limit the accuracy of this @xmath14-d relation , in particular the sensitivity of the observations . a best fit line to the m82 data",
    "indicates @xmath16 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ surfb ] .",
    "it is also possible to fit an upper limit to the snr samples included here , of @xmath17 , which is less steep than the proposed upper boundary of @xmath18 by @xcite .",
    "as has previously been reported @xcite , the observed trends of the @xmath14-d relation for snrs in m82 are consistent with those derived for galactic snrs , but that the snrs in arp220 are clearly much more luminous with respect to their equivalent sizes than those in m82 or the milky way .       and",
    "the small dashed line represents a power - law fit to calculate the deceleration parameter for diameters @xmath19.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ cumdist ] shows the cumulative distribution of the sizes of the snrs presented here .",
    "this can potentially give information on the supernova rate and snr evolution and should follow the relation @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the supernova rate and m is the average deceleration parameter . if it is assumed that the snrs are in a uniform density medium and are undergoing free expansion , the cumulative number will show a linear increase .",
    "as can be seen , the cumulative distribution can be fitted by a linear increase in diameter for d@xmath224pc .",
    "if a snr has entered the sedov phase of its evolution , its size will increase as @xmath23 , where t is the age of the snr .",
    "this predicts the cumulative number to increase as @xmath24 .",
    "the best - fit power law to our sample of snrs for d@xmath254.5pc shows the cumulative number is increasing as @xmath26 , giving a lower limit to the average deceleration parameter of 0.93@xmath270.06 .",
    "this would suggest the snrs are still experiencing free expansions and have not entered the sedov phase . in the specific case of 43.31 + 59.2 ,",
    "@xcite have calculated a lower limit of @xmath00.68 for the deceleration parameter from vlbi monitoring . + no evidence has been found to suggest that galactic snrs up to @xmath28400yrs old have begun to slow in their expansion @xcite , and as @xmath050% of the known remnants in m82 are @xmath25330",
    "years old , it is unlikely that deceleration will actually be observed .",
    "however , the high interstellar medium pressures thought to be present in the centre of a starburst could begin to affect the expansion of a snr earlier than would be observed for remnants in our own galaxy .",
    "a good example of this is the supernova sn1993j in the galaxy m81 , which has been shown to have experienced varying degrees of deceleration over the last 14 years . @xcite have discussed the evolution of the radio shell of sn1993j , derived from vlbi observations .",
    "these show the expanding shell to have begun a deceleration as little as 30 days after the explosion , but then to have increased to an observed maximum between 300 and 1600 days with a deceleration parameter of @xmath00.74 , by which point its expansion velocity had decreased to @xmath08900 .",
    "the deceleration of this snr has subsequently decreased to a deceleration parameter of @xmath00.85 .",
    "+ the diffuse background emission observed in m82 has a flux density @xmath00.5jy and is likely to be from evolved supernova remnants .",
    "the observed turnover in the n(@xmath25d)-d plot for diameters above @xmath05pc is a consequence of the fact that the sample is incomplete for sources with low surface brightness , because the surface brightnesses of such large evolved snrs match that of the observed extended background emission , making them difficult to detect .",
    "the n(@xmath25d)-d plot presented here is the most complete at 5ghz to date .",
    "as the instrument sensitivity improves , it should become possible to detect the more diffuse and weaker snrs within m82 .",
    "the range of expansion velocities observed ( see section [ msre ] ) could initially be interperated as a consequence of the range in age of these sources .",
    "however , as can be seen in table [ tab2 ] , the larger ( and presumably older ) remnants do not necessarily have slower velocities .",
    "[ expvel ] shows a plot of expansion velocity versus source diameter .",
    "there appears to be no correlation , which would suggest that the snrs are situated in very different , local gas density environments and are experiencing varying degrees of deceleration .",
    "@xcite assume a pressure in the starburst region of m82 of @xmath29 and argue that the majority of the remnants observed are evolving into the interclump medium of molecular clouds with densities @xmath30 .",
    "they use this to predict a canonical expansion velocity for the snrs of @xmath0500 , which assuming that the sizes observed are typically a few parsecs , would imply ages of thousands of years for the snrs in m82 .",
    "these relatively low velocities are a factor of four smaller than the lowest observed velocities and a factor of @xmath020 times smaller than the highest of the velocities just measured , as well as those measured from vlbi observations of the most compact sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whilst there will be part of the m82 starburst at these pressures , it is evident from the size and spread of the velocities that the starburst region is not in a static pressure equilibrium and a range of pressures is present.@xcite also suggest that the snrs in m82 have entered the radiative phase of their evolution ; as a remnant in a density of @xmath30 for explosion energies of @xmath31 ergs become radiative at a radius @xmath0 1pc .",
    "the lower - limit to the average deceleration parameter calculated from the n(@xmath25d)-d relation in section [ nd ] of @xmath00.93 , would suggest that the observed population is still in the free - expansion phase of its evolution .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that a number of remnants evolving into an ism with large density variations and experiencing varying degrees of deceleration could give rise to a n(@xmath25d)-d relationship that looks similar to free - expansion , thus providing an explanation for the variety of expansion velocities observed .",
    "+ assuming that the sources are undergoing free expansion and have not yet entered the sedov phase of their evolution , an estimate can be made of the densities of gas into which the snrs are expanding .",
    "this will cause a peak in the radio emission at a diameter given by @xmath32pc where @xmath33 is the ejected mass ( in units of 10 ) and @xmath34 is the hydrogen density ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the smallest snr observed in m82 ( with the exception of 41.95 + 57.4 ) has an average diameter of 0.65pc .",
    "assuming @xmath36 ( i.e. an ejected mass of 5 ) , provides a density of @xmath37 .",
    "this would clearly suggest that the snrs in m82 are expanding into regions of the ism with lower densities than the @xmath38 of the ambient medium , ( as larger sources give rise to lower density estimates ) .",
    "such low densities could be the result of stellar winds from the massive progenitor stars having driven away most of the surrounding material , and thus forming low density bubbles , prior to the supernova explosions taking place .",
    "@xcite have studied the variability of 24 of the remnants in m82 and from statistical arguments , have proposed that only a quarter of their sample exhibits the expected decays in flux density of @xmath28 1% per year .",
    "the remainder of the sample shows little variability , indicating radio - emitting lifetimes of @xmath0 1000yrs .",
    "this would agree in part with the studies by @xcite suggesting that the expansion of the supernova remnants is much smaller ( @xmath0500 ) than those measured from the current observations .",
    "however , the velocities presented here not only confirm those made using independent vlbi investigations , but also provide robust measurements for an additional four snrs ; in all cases the observations show expansion velocities considerably in excess of the value of @xmath0500suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is possible to use the results presented here to directly estimate the supernova rate in m82 . as indicated by the @xmath14-d relation discussed in section [ snr ] , galactic and m82",
    "snr appear to be of the same class of object , and are therefore comparable .",
    "cassiopeia a is an example of a galactic snr with a known age ( @xmath39 years ) .",
    "assuming that the snr in m82 that are more luminous than cassiopeia a ( 22 of the total 37 detected ) are younger , it is possible to estimate the supernova rate as : @xmath40 .",
    "the supernova rate can also be calculated using the measured n(@xmath41 relation .",
    "assuming that the sample is complete for d@xmath254pc and that the snrs are in free expansion , the supernova rate can be estimated to be @xmath42 .",
    "taking an average expansion velocity of @xmath05000gives an estimate in very good agreement with the previous calculation .",
    "this is clearly the case for the remnant , 43.31 + 592 , which is taken to be representative of the whole population in the light of the calculated average deceleration parameter in section [ nd ] .",
    "assuming a miller - scalo initial mass function ( imf ) , taking lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100 respectively , these supernova rates can be used to calculate a star formation rate ( sfr ) using @xcite @xmath43 using the above values for @xmath21 this implies a sfr of @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 which is in close agreement with the value of @xmath02 derived from fir , h@xmath47 and ultraviolet observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
