    "one of the counterintuitive effects of quantum mechnics is the `` negative result measurement '' , i.e. the nonobservance of a result represents additional information and hence modifies the wave function .",
    "this notion is first prescribed in 1960 by renninger@xcite , and later dicke who analyzed the change of an atomic wave function by the nonscattering of a photon@xcite . in 1993 , elitzur and vaidman proposed the novel concept of interaction - free measurements ( ifms ) , in which the presence of an absorbing object in a mach - zehnder interferometer can be inferred without apparent interaction with the probe photon@xcite . in recent years ,",
    "ev ifms led to numerous investigations and several experiments have been performed@xcite . in the original ev scheme ,",
    "the measurement is interaction - free at most half of the time .",
    "however , when combined with quantun zeno effect ifms can in principle be done with unity efficiency , in an asympototic sense@xcite .    aside from their conceptual significance , ifms are of obvious application interest too . as emphasized by vaidman , the paradoxical feature of the ev ifm is that it obtains information about a region in space without anything coming in , out , or through this place@xcite .",
    "this feature allows people to monitor radiation sensitive objects without exciting them , such as the quantum nondemolition measurement of the ground state atom number@xcite , non - invasive testing of materials@xcite , localization of atom beams without physical interaction@xcite , interaction - free imaging@xcite and so on .",
    "people also applied the idea of ifms in quantum information science , such as quantum cryptography@xcite and counterfactual computation@xcite .    in the field of quantum information science",
    ", a physical system may be regarded as an information carrier if it can be prepared in some distinguishable quantum states .",
    "the advantage of processing information quantum mechanically is that , contrary to the classical case , information can be stored in quantum superposition states .",
    "however the quantum superposition is quite fragile .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the similar treatments on ifms can be applied in the nondemolition interrogation of the internal state of quantum object .",
    "suppose there is a black box , in which a quantum object characterized by its quantum superposition can be persent ( or absent ) .",
    "our task is to determine if the quantum object in it , without disturbing the internal state of the object .",
    "we may call such an interrogation a nondistortion quantum interrogation ( abbreviated nqi ) . unfortunately , ifms in general are not internal state preserving measurements . since quantum superpositon of the object is subject to measurement dependent decoherence .",
    "obtaining of `` which way '' information will cause an unavoidable change of the internal state of the detected object , even though the measurement is seemingly `` interaction free '' .    in this paper we will concentrate on some fundamental limits for the nqi process , under some definite physical conditions . in section",
    "ii , we present general physical assumptions that we use to formulate the nqi process .",
    "section iii is devoted to single - shot nqi process , in which the interaction between the detected object and the probe system takes place only once .",
    "we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for successful performing a single - shot nondistortion interrogation of an unknown quantum state .",
    "we also make a primary attempt to test this criterion when the probe system and the interaction are restricted .",
    "we find that in some simple cases it reduces to a solvable problem . in section",
    "iv we discuss iterative nqi processes . a sufficient criterion for zeno type nqi processes",
    "is obtained .",
    "we conclude in section v by summarizing all the results .",
    "`` black box '' problems have attracted people in many contexts .",
    "the aim of the nondistortion quantum interrogation is to find out whether there is a quantum object in a black box ( a region in space ) without disturbing the internal state of the object , even if its original quantum state is unknown .    according to von neumann s treatments of quantum measurement , any observable",
    "can be coupled to a pointer .",
    "the information about the observable is obtained by detecting the pointer@xcite .",
    "all the possible measurement results about this pointer can be described by a set of orthogonal projectors @xmath0 in hilbert space which satisfy @xmath1 a von neumann measurement will take the probed pure state @xmath2 to @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 , if the final detected pointer is in the @xmath5 .",
    "the original quantum state will be modified by the measurement process unless the state@xmath6 is the eigenstate of the projector @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , von neumann measurement is not an effiective way to perform nondistortion interrogation , especially when the quantum state in the black box is unknown to us .    for the purpose of nqi",
    ", we use a probe wave function @xmath7 . we let part of it @xmath8 go through the black box and interact with the object in the box .",
    "after the interaction @xmath9 and @xmath10 are recombined and a measurement is done on the probe wave function , possibly after a unitary operation on it ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the above process is a bit similar to the case described by ev scheme .",
    "indeed , it will be shown that ev ifm is a special case of our  black box problem  . while , to perform the nqi in the general case some more exquisite designs need to be considered . to formulate general nqi processes",
    "we make the following assumptions :    \\a ) @xmath11 , the quantum system under interrogation ( the quantum object in the black box ) , is a metastable system whose hilbert space is denoted as @xmath12 with dimension @xmath13 .",
    "\\b ) the hilbert space of the probe system @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is composed of two orthogonal subspaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the hilbert spaces of @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively and the dimension of the space @xmath17 is @xmath21 .",
    "we let @xmath22 go through the black box and interact with s ( if the object is in the box ) , while @xmath19 is under free evolution .",
    "\\c ) the interaction between @xmath14 and @xmath11 is governed by a unitary operator .",
    "we assume the time of the interaction is some known @xmath23 .",
    "when the interaction is over , any state driven out of space @xmath12 will quickly decay in an irreversible way to some stable ground state @xmath24 which is out of space @xmath12 .",
    "the decay signal will be registered by some properly arranged sensitive detectors , if the decay event actually happens .    in assumption",
    "a ) we note that the physical property of the interrogated quantum system should be known to us although the original internal state of this system may be unknown .",
    "more exactly , a nqi only refers to an interrogation for a definite hilbert space . in assumption",
    "b ) , the introduction of @xmath16 might appear to be redundant since it does not interact with @xmath11 .",
    "but it is actually vital for the purpose of nqi , because the interaction between @xmath20 and @xmath25 changes the interference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 which provides information on what is in the black box .",
    "assumption c ) can be named as `` dissipation postulation '' , which makes sure that the state out of the space @xmath12 can not travel back into the original space @xmath12 after the interaction between the probe system and the detected system .",
    "we assume that the interrogation process will drive the initial sytem @xmath11 into an extended space @xmath26 , while the states in the space @xmath27 will rapidly decay into a stable state @xmath28 ( which is out of the space @xmath26 ) in an irreversible way .",
    "based on the above assumptions , the following major steps are followed to find out if there is an object in the black box ( see fig.1 ) :    \\i ) let the probe wave function @xmath20 go through the black box and interact with the quantum object if it is in the box .",
    "\\ii ) the decay signal detectors are used to register any decay event .",
    "if a decay is detected , we conclude that the quantum object was in the black box but its initial state is destroyed .",
    "otherwise , go to the next step .",
    "this is equivalent to a partial projection measurement on the whole system @xmath29 : @xmath30 where the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to unity operators of hilbert space @xmath33 and its complementary space @xmath34 respectively .",
    "iii)perform a von neumann measurement on the probe wave function ( in @xmath15 ) .",
    "possible measurement outcomes are characterized by some projectors in an orthogonal projector set @xmath35 .    in step iii ) , we keep in mind that if nothing is in the black box the probe will be in some definite final state corresponding to the free evolution of the initial state .",
    "we designate the projector to that state as @xmath36 .",
    "if a successful interrogation of the object can be done , the probe will end up in some different state .",
    "for the consideration of universality we require that the probability of successful nondistortion interrogations of the quantum object be independent on its ( unknown ) initial state .",
    "we approximately divide the nondistortion interrogation into two types : single - shot nqi and iterative nqi according to how many times the interaction happens within an interrogation process .",
    "a scheme of single - shot nqi will follow the above steps i)-iii ) . in iterative nqi process ,",
    "step i ) and ii ) are repeated .",
    "after a certain number of interactions the final measurement ( step iii ) ) will be executed . of course , some suitable operations on the probe wave function are allowed in between the iterations .",
    "some results about two types of nqi processes are shown in section iii and iv .",
    "let the initial state of the probe wave function be @xmath7 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "when the probe passes through the black box the time evolution of the whole system is as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the free hamiltonian of the systems @xmath11 and @xmath14 respectively , and @xmath42 characterizes the interaction between the two systems .",
    "if there is nothing in the black box the interaction hamiltonian @xmath43 vanishes and the above process reduces to the free evolution of two separate systems .",
    "in contrast , when the black box is occupied with the quantum object , @xmath44 may be driven into a larger space @xmath26 due to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath42 . in view of the assumption",
    "c ) a decay could happen with certain probability . while , if no decay signal is detected , the quantum state of the whole system is collapsed into the following ( a projection on @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the unity operators in the hilbert spaces @xmath17 and @xmath12 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to simplify the future calculations ,",
    "the above wave function is unnormalized . in eq([e3.2 ] ) , we see that the evolution of the system is fully specified by the following interrogation operator @xmath14 : @xmath51      in the subsection we will review some results in ref@xcite .    to obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for single - shot nqi the following lemma is necessary .",
    "lemma1 : the necessary condition that a single - shot nqi can be done is that there exist a pair of vectors @xmath52 which satisfy @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "proof : if the black box is empty no interaction takes place in it .",
    "thus , the probe ends up in the state @xmath55 . in term of the promise in above section",
    ", this process will give rise to an exact detecting outcome @xmath56 .",
    "on the contrary , the evolution of the probe wave function will be modified when a quantum object occupies the black box . to make sure that a successful nqi can be done ,",
    "there must exist a projector @xmath57 ( orthogonal to @xmath36 ) in the set @xmath35 which corresponds to the outcome component of nqi with nonzero probability @xmath58 .",
    "this relation can be embodied in the following equations : @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is some normalized vector of the probe .",
    "relying on the eqs([e3.4],[e3.5 ] ) , we may obtain : @xmath62 in terms of the defination of the operator @xmath14 the vector @xmath63 is a vector in hilbert space @xmath64 .",
    "thereby , setting a wave vector @xmath65 , which is the projection of @xmath66 on @xmath17 , we find @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , we also have the relation @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 and @xmath70 are nonzero we deduce that @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the eq([e3.6 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 . since @xmath74 is an arbitrary vector in the space @xmath12 the following must be satisfied : @xmath75 we thus complete our proof .",
    "once the necessary condition ( [ e3.8 ] ) is satisfied the interrogation operator @xmath14 will modify the wavefunction component @xmath76 in the following way : @xmath77 here , @xmath78 and the vectors @xmath79 form the orthogonal complete bases in hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "as we know , the decomposition of a pure quantum state is roughly dependent on the structure of its hilbert space .",
    "however , it should be noted that the representation of eq([e3.91 ] ) is not enough `` compact '' .",
    "it seems too extravagant for decomposing the state @xmath80 in the hilbert space @xmath81 . whether we can choose a more compact subspace in the space @xmath81 to achieve a full decomposition for it",
    "this point is quite vital for obtaining the necessary and sufficient condition for the single - shot nqi . to express the eq([e3.91 ] ) in a more compact way the following steps should be done .",
    "we may define a set of operators @xmath82 $ ] if the eq([e3.8 ] ) holds . here",

    "is denoted as @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath86 can be seen as the annihilation operator for the component @xmath87 : @xmath88 if we set the intersection of all the @xmath13 kernel operators as @xmath89 the operator @xmath90 will annihilate the quantum state @xmath91 . because @xmath92 where @xmath93",
    ". therefore , a more compact space for decomposing the quantum state @xmath91 is @xmath94 . here",
    ", @xmath95 is the complementary space of kernel space @xmath96 in @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the dimension of the space @xmath95 by @xmath97 .",
    "when we pick up some set of orthonormal states @xmath98 spanning the space @xmath99",
    ". then , eq([e3.91 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath100 we may outline the above treatments into the following lemma .",
    "lemma2 : eq([e3.9 ] ) is the equivalent representation of the eq([e3.8 ] ) .    in light of the above preparations we may provide our main theroem .",
    "theorem 1 : the necessary and sufficient condition for the single - shot nqi is that eq([e3.9 ] ) holds and @xmath101 is linearly independent of the state set @xmath102 .    proof : lemma 1 and 2 show that eq([e3.9 ] ) is the necessary condition for single - shot nqi .",
    "if eq([e3.9 ] ) holds , in hilbert space @xmath103 the final state of the whole system will be : @xmath104 reconsidering eqs .",
    "( [ e3.4 ] ) and ( [ e3.5 ] ) , we may attain the following relations : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 subtracting eq([e3.13 ] ) from eq([e3.11 ] ) we obtain @xmath108 @xmath109 requires that @xmath101 be linearly independent of the set of vectors @xmath102 .",
    "we thus confirm the necessity of the criterion .",
    "we may further prove the converse by constructing a projector @xmath110 satisfying eq([e3.4 ] ) and eq([e3.5 ] ) .",
    "this procedure can appeal to the schmidt orthogonalization method .",
    "first we define the state set @xmath111 consisting of @xmath112 normalized vectors @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the normalization coefficient for @xmath115 .",
    "we assume that @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath117 and @xmath118 are orthogonal to each other and @xmath119 is linearly independent of @xmath120 , we may deduce that all vectors in the state set @xmath111 are linearly independent . to construct an orthonormal set out of @xmath111 ,",
    "we let the first @xmath121 vectors be @xmath122 .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath123th vector using @xmath124 : @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the normalization coefficient . similarly , the last vector is @xmath127with the normalization coefficient @xmath128 .",
    "it is then obvious that the projector @xmath129 satisfies eqs([e3.4 ] ) and ( [ e3.5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , once the coefficient @xmath130 is fixed the projector @xmath110 obtained by using schmidt orthogonalization will maximize the success probobility @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "we thus complete our proof .    from our proof",
    "it is clear that @xmath132 is not redundant , even though it does not interact with the object . if @xmath133 the capability of performing an nqi will be severely limited .",
    "for instance , if @xmath134 is zero in eq([e3.9 ] ) ( this corresponds to an ifm of an opaque object in which the probe wave function is blocked by the absorbing object ) , no nondistortion interrogation of the object can be done without the introduction of @xmath132 .",
    "we may elucidate the novel nqi phenomena in the sense of quantum interference . the quantum object in the black box can be seen as a scattering object corresponding to the probe wave .",
    "the scattering process between the object and the probe wave makes each scattering wave component entangle different evolution of the object .",
    "if all the information on the evolution of the whole composite system is known it possibly allows us to choose a proper probe wave such that a successful scattering wave component is produced . for the purpose of nqithis component",
    "gets entangled with the free evolution of the object .",
    "now , it seems clearly for the meaning of the above theorem .",
    "once the necessary and sufficient condition for single - shot nqi holds the form of this successful probe wave component @xmath66 can be obtained by using schmidt orthogonalization steps outlined in the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "we note that the vectors @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfying eq([e3.8 ] ) may not be unique . however , once @xmath137 and @xmath138 are chosen we may obtain the optimal success probability for these two vectors , by following the steps outlined in the proof of theorem 1 . if the initial state of the probe is @xmath139 , the success probability is @xmath140 therefore we have the following corollary .",
    "corollary 1 : under the condition that the wave function @xmath141 and @xmath137 are given the optimal success probability of the nqi is as follows : @xmath142      in the former context we have pointed out the operator @xmath14 fully characterizes the interaction between two systems and the dissipation process . in this subsection ,",
    "starting from the operator @xmath14 we will devote ourself to explore the existance of the pair of vectors @xmath141 and @xmath137 satisfying the criterion of nqi .    the operator @xmath14 can be written as : @xmath143 for the simplicity of discussion we will omit the subscripts of the vectors . unless pointed out otherwise @xmath144 will indicate the vectors in the hilbert space @xmath17 and @xmath145 will indicate the vectors in the hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "once a successful nqi  process can be put in practice the operator @xmath14 , as a subblock in a unitary matrix ( see eq([e3.3 ] ) ) , satisfies the following relation : @xmath146 we set @xmath147 and @xmath148 the relation([e3.18 ] ) can be parameterized as : @xmath149 furthermore , we may define @xmath150 as a matrix @xmath151 with a set of parameters @xmath152 .",
    "thus , whether the equation ( [ e3.18 ] ) holds is equivalent to whether there are a set of parameters @xmath153satisfying the following equation : @xmath154 since the above equations are linear , in principle , it is possible to identify the existence of the unknown parameters @xmath155 satisfying the equation set([e3.20 ] ) .",

    "thus , if there is a quantum object characterized in the state @xmath252 in the black box , after the probe wavefunction initially prepared in the state @xmath253 undergoes n iterations , if we choose n such that @xmath254 , the non - decay quantum fraction of the whole system will be transformed into : @xmath255 where @xmath256 . as the final result",
    ", the probe will be end up in the state @xmath257 with the probability @xmath258 , which goes to unity in the limit of large n and small @xmath259 ( see the ref@xcite ) . on the contrary , if the black box is empty the quantum state of the probe will evolve into : @xmath260   \\label{e4.6}\\ ] ] with certainty . due to the orthogonality and ( asymptotic ) certainty of the two outcomes we may perfectly perform the nqi in the iterative way .",
    "this completes the proof of theroem 3 .",
    "in the quantum interrogation , the interaction between the probe wave and the quantum object modifies the interference among the original probe wave components .",
    "meanwhile , each of the probe wave components entangles the corresponding evolution of the scattered object . for the nqi processes",
    ", there must exist a successful probe wave component , which should entangle with the free evolution of the object , at the same time , be orthogonal to any other scattering wave components .",
    "quantum measurement theory ensures that once this component is registered the corresponding quantum branch will come into reality . in this case",
    ", we may not only obtain information on the location of a quantum object , but also make the evolution of the internal state of the detected object free from the disturbance from the interrogation process . here",
    ", we should emphasize that before an experimentist provides a practical nqi  scheme all the physical conditions about the interaction in the black box should be considered carefully . in addition , as far as some complicated interactions are concerned , it is quite difficult to test the criterion of nqi .",
    "especially , how to obtain the sufficient and necessary criterion for the iterative nqi processes is still an open question .",
    "nevertheless , nqi may provide some miraculous applications .",
    "it should be noted that the interrogated target is not a quantum state , but a space of quantum states . in other words ,",
    "quantum information in hilbert space @xmath12 will not be contaminated by the probing process .",
    "this way to manipulate quantum objects is of potential application in the recently developed quantum information science .",
    "since the detected system need not be restricted to pure states we may also cast our interests on mixed states . as pointed out by ptting et .",
    "al @xcite the nondistortion interrogation provides a tool to monitor a subsystem in a many - particle system without destroying the entanglement between the particles .    in conclusion , we have studied the process of nqi under some physical assumptions .",
    "we proved the necessary and sufficient condition for single - shot nqi process in our formulation .",
    "furthermore , we consider the nqi processes in iterative cases and obtain a sufficient condition for the iterative nondistortion quantum interrogation . as a novel method to manipulate quantum systems nqi may be applied in future quantum information processing .",
