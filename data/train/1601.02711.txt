    "conformal contraction_. under the normalization @xmath7 , it follows that the image @xmath8 must be contained in @xmath0 . however , not every subdomain of the unit disk is its image under a conformal contraction .",
    "let us consider a convex domain @xmath9 that contains @xmath10 and has @xmath11-smooth boundary .",
    "with such a domain we associate three radii :    * _ outer radius _",

    "the images of @xmath0 under conformal contractions fixing @xmath10 are precisely those domains @xmath13 for which the density of harmonic measure @xmath25 with respect to @xmath10 is at least @xmath26 .",
    "this follows immediately from the conformal invariance of harmonic measure and the fact that its density on the boundary of the unit disk is @xmath26 .",
    "thus , theorem  [ contra ] gives a sufficient condition for @xmath13 to have dense harmonic measure .",

    "it should be noted that the term @xmath31 is scale - invariant , while the second term , @xmath32 , tends to @xmath33 as the domain is scaled down .",
    "thus , for any convex domain @xmath13 of class @xmath11 theorem  [ contra ] gives an explicit factor @xmath34 such that the scaled - down domain @xmath35 is the image of @xmath0 under a conformal contraction .",
    "this can be compared to the classical kellogg - warschawski theorem  @xcite*theorem 3.5 which asserts that the conformal map of the disk onto a dini - smooth jordan domain @xmath13 has a uniformly continuous derivative .",
    "the latter also implies that @xmath35 is the image of @xmath0 under a conformal contraction for sufficiently small @xmath34 .",

    "the higher - dimensional version of theorem  [ contra ] is stated in terms of the harmonic measure , since there is no longer a rich supply of conformal maps .",

    "the exponential term in   is scale invariant , while the factor @xmath44 makes sure that the left hand side of   tends to @xmath10 as the domain is scaled down .",
    "the sufficient conditions of theorems  [ contra ] and  [ hithm ] are not necessary ; however , they are reasonably precise . for example , in the special case @xmath45 the hypothesis of theorem  [ contra ] is that @xmath46 , which is both necessary and sufficient in this case . the higher - dimensional estimate is less accurate : the inequality   simplifies to @xmath47 , where the right hand side is less than @xmath48 but converges to @xmath48 as @xmath49 .    to justify the presence of three radii @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 in theorems  [ contra ] and  [ hithm ] ,",

    "one obtains a domain that fails the conclusion of the theorem , which only the curvature radius detects . to show the necessity of @xmath14 ,",
