    "estimation is a crucial application in the energy management system ( ems ) .",
    "the well - known static state estimation ( sse ) methods @xcite assume that the power system is operating in quasi - steady state , based on which the static states  the voltage magnitude and phase angles of the buses  are estimated by using scada and/or synchrophasor measurements .",
    "sse is critical for power system monitoring as it provides inputs for other ems applications such as automatic generation control and optimal power flow .",
    "however , sse may not be sufficient for desirable situational awareness as the system states evolve more rapidly due to an increasing penetration of renewable generation and distributed energy resources . therefore , dynamic state estimation ( dse ) processes estimating the dynamic states ( i.e.",
    ", the internal states of generators ) by using highly synchronized pmu measurements with high sampling rates will be critical for the wide - area monitoring , protection , and control of power systems .    for both sse and dse",
    ", two significant challenges make their practical application significantly difficult .",
    "first , the system model and parameters used for estimation can be inaccurate , which is often called _ model uncertainty _",
    "@xcite , consequently deteriorating estimation in some scenarios .",
    "second , the measurements used for estimation are vulnerable to cyber attacks , which in turn leads to compromised measurements that can greatly mislead the estimation .    for the first challenge , there are recent efforts on validating the dynamic model of the generator and calibrating its parameters @xcite , which dse can be based on",
    ". however , model validation itself can be very challenging .",
    "hence , it is a more viable solution to improve the estimators by making them more robust to the model uncertainty .    for the second challenge ,",
    "false data injection attacks targeted against sse are proposed in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", a probabilistic risk mitigation model is presented for cyber attacks against pmu networks , focusing on topological observability of sse .",
    "however , in this paper we discuss cyber attacks against dse and estimators that are robust to cyber attacks .    as for the approaches for performing dse",
    ", there are mainly two classes of methods that have been proposed :    1 .",
    "_ stochastic estimators _ : given a discrete - time representation of a dynamical system , the observed measurements , and the statistical information on process noise and measurement noise , kalman filter and its many derivatives have been proposed that calculate the kalman gain as a function of the relative certainty of the current state estimate and the measurements @xcite .",
    "2 .   _ deterministic observers _ : given a continuous- or discrete - time dynamical system depicted by state - space matrices , a combination of matrix equalities and inequalities are solved , while guaranteeing asymptotic ( or bounded ) estimation error .",
    "the solution to these equations is often matrices that are used in an observer to estimate states and other dynamic quantities @xcite .    for power systems",
    ", dse has been implemented by several stochastic estimators , such as extended kalman filter ( ekf ) @xcite , unscented kalman filter ( ukf ) @xcite , square - root unscented kalman filter ( sr - ukf )  @xcite , extended particle filter @xcite , and ensemble kalman filter @xcite .",
    "while these techniques produce good estimation under nominal conditions , most of them lack the ability to deal with significant model uncertainty and malicious cyber attacks .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present alternatives that address these major limitations . to achieve this , we study dse by utilizing recently developed kalman filters and nonlinear observers .",
    "the contributions of this paper include :    1 .",
    "introducing cubature kalman filter ( ckf ) @xcite that possesses an important virtue of mathematical rigor rooted in the third - degree spherical - radial cubature rule for numerically computing gaussian - weighted integrals ; 2 .   presenting observers for dse of nonlinear power systems with model uncertainties and cyber attacks ; 3 .   comparing the strengths and limitations of different estimation methods for dse with significant model uncertainty and cyber attacks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "multimachinedynamics ] , we discuss the nonlinear dynamics of the multi - machine power system .",
    "the physical and technical depictions of the model uncertainty and attack - threat model are introduced in section  [ sec : at ] .",
    "the ckf and one dynamic observer are introduced in sections  [ sec : ckf1 ] and [ sec : observers ] .",
    "then , numerical results are given in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "finally , insightful remarks and conclusions are presented in sections  [ sec : remarks ] and  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "[ sec : multimachinedynamics ] here we briefly discuss the power system model used for dse . each of the @xmath0 generators is described by the fourth - order transient model in local @xmath1-@xmath2 reference frame : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the generator serial number , @xmath5 is the rotor angle , @xmath6 is the rotor speed in rad / s , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transient voltage along @xmath2 and @xmath1 axes ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are stator currents at @xmath2 and @xmath1 axes ; @xmath11 is the mechanical torque , @xmath12 is the electric air - gap torque , and @xmath13 is the internal field voltage ; @xmath14 is the rated value of angular frequency , @xmath15 is the inertia constant , and @xmath16 is the damping factor ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the open - circut time constants for @xmath2 and @xmath1 axes ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the synchronous reactance and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the transient reactance respectively at the @xmath2 and @xmath1 axes .    the @xmath11 and @xmath13 in ( [ gen model ] ) are considered as inputs .",
    "the set of generators where pmus are installed is denoted by @xmath23 . for generator @xmath24 ,",
    "the terminal voltage phaosr @xmath25 and current phasor @xmath26 can be measured and are used as the outputs",

    "note that the model presented here is used for dse for which the real - time inputs are assumed to be unavailable and @xmath11 and @xmath13 only take steady - state values , mainly because these inputs are difficult to measure @xcite .",
    "however , when we simulate the power system to mimic the real system dynamics , we model an ieee type dc1 excitation system and a simplified turbine - governor system for each generator and thus @xmath11 and @xmath13 change with time due to the governor and the excitation control .",
    "we do not directly use a detailed model including the exciter and governor as in @xcite for the dse mainly because 1 ) a good model should be simple enough to facilitate design @xcite , 2 ) it is harder to validate a more detailed model and there are also more parameters that need to be calibrated @xcite , and 3 ) the computational burden can be higher for a more detailed model , which may not satisfy the requirement of real - time estimation .",
    "[ sec : at ]    here we discuss two great challenges for an effective dse , which are the model uncertainty and potential cyber attacks .",
    "the term _ model uncertainty _ refers to the differences or errors between models and reality . assuming that the dynamical models are perfectly accurate can generate sub - optimal control or estimation laws .",
    "various control and estimation theory studies investigated methods that addresses the discrepancy between the actual physics and models .",
    "the model uncertainty can be caused by the following reasons .    1 .",
    "* unknown inputs * : the unknown inputs against the system dynamics include @xmath53  ( representing the unknown plant disturbances ) , @xmath54 ( denoting the unknown control inputs ) , and @xmath55  ( depicting potential actuator faults ) . for simplicity , we can combine them into one unknown input quantity , @xmath56 , defined as @xmath57 + defining @xmath58 to be the known weight distribution matrix of the distribution of unknown inputs with respect to each state - equation .",
    "the term @xmath59 models a general class of unknown inputs such as : nonlinearities , modeling uncertainties , noise , parameter variations , unmeasurable system inputs , model reduction errors , and actuator faults  @xcite .",
    "for example , the equation @xmath60 most likely has no unknown inputs , as there is no modeling uncertainty related to that process .",
    "hence , the first row of @xmath61 can be identically zero .",
    "the process dynamics under unknown inputs can be written as follows : @xmath62 2 .   * unavailable inputs",
    "* : as discussed in section [ sec : multimachinedynamics ] , the real - time inputs @xmath63 in ( [ gen model ] ) can be unavailable , in which case the steady - states inputs @xmath64 are used for estimation .",
    "* parameter inaccuracy * : the parameters in the system model can be inaccurate .",
    "for example , the reduced admittance matrix @xmath65 can be inaccurate when a fault or the following topology change are not detected .      the national electric sector cybersecurity organization resource ( nescor ) developed cyber - security failure scenarios with corresponding impact analyses  @xcite .",
    "the wampac failure scenarios motivate the research in this paper include : a ) _ measurement data ( from pmus ) compromised due to pdc authentication compromise _ and b ) _ communications compromised between pmus and control center _  @xcite . specifically , we consider the following three types of attacks @xcite .    1 .",
    "* data integrity attacks * : an adversary attempts to corrupt the content of either the measurement or the control signals .",
    "a specific example of data integrity attacks are man - in - the - middle attacks , where the adversary intercepts the measurement signals and modifies them in transit . for dse",
    "the pmu measurements can be modified and corrupted .",
    "* denial of service ( dos ) attack * : an attacker attempts to introduce a denial in communication of measurement .",
    "the communication of a sensor could be jammed by flooding the network with spurious packets . for dse the consequence can be that the updated measurements can not be sent to the control center .",
    "* replay attacks * : a special case of data integrity attacks , where the attacker replays a previous snapshot of a valid communication packet sequence that contains measurements in order to deceive the system . for dse the pmu measurements can be changed to be those in the past .",
    "[ sec : ckf1 ]    unlike many estimation methods that are either computationally unmanageable or require special assumptions about the form of the process and observation models , kalman filter ( kf ) only utilizes the first two moments of the state ( mean and covariance ) in its update rule @xcite .",
    "it consists of two steps : in prediction step , the filter propagates the estimate from last time step to current time step ; in update step , the filter updates the estimate using collected measurements .",
    "kf was initially developed for linear systems while for power system dse the system equations and outputs have strong nonlinearity .",
    "thus variants of kf that can deal with nonlinear systems have been introduced , such as ekf and ukf . here , we briefly introduce ekf and ukf , and give more details for cubature kalman filter ( ckf ) .",
    "although ekf maintains the elegant and computationally efficient recursive update form of kf , it works well only in a ` mild ' nonlinear environment , owing it to the first - order taylor series approximation for nonlinear functions @xcite .",
    "it is sub - optimal and can easily lead to divergence .",
    "also , the linearization can be applied only if the jacobian matrix exists and calculating jacobian matrices can be difficult and error - prone .",
    "for dse , ekf has been discussed in @xcite .      the unscented transformation ( ut ) @xcite is developed to address the deficiencies of linearization by providing a more direct and explicit mechanism for transforming mean and covariance information . based on ut , julier et al . @xcite",
    "propose the ukf as a derivative - free alternative to ekf .",
    "the gaussian distribution is represented by a set of deterministically chosen sample points called sigma points . the ukf has been applied to power system dse , for which no linearization or calculation of jacobian matrices is needed @xcite .",
    "however , for the sigma - points , the stem at the center ( the mean ) is highly significant as it carries more weight which is usually negative for high - dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , the ukf is supposed to encounter numerical instability troubles when used in high - dimensional problems .",
    "several techniques including the square - root unscented kalman filter ( sr - ukf ) have been proposed to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "[ sec : ckff ]    ekf and ukf can suffer from the curse of dimensionality while becoming detrimental in high - dimensional state - space models of size twenty or more  especially when there are high degree of nonlinearities in the equations that describe the state - space model @xcite . making use of the spherical - radial cubature rule , arasaratnam et al .",
    "@xcite propose ckf , which possesses an important virtue of mathematical rigor rooted in the third - degree spherical - radial cubature rule for numerically computing gaussian - weighted integrals .    a nonlinear system ( without model uncertainty or attack vectors )",
    "can be written in discrete - time form as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are states , inputs , and observed measurements at time step @xmath70 ; the estimated mean and estimated covariance of the estimation error are @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; @xmath73 and @xmath52 are vectors consisting of nonlinear state transition functions and measurement functions ; @xmath74 is the gaussian process noise at time step @xmath75 ; @xmath76 is the gaussian measurement noise at time step @xmath70 ; and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are covariance matrices of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the procedure of ckf consists of a prediction step and an update step and is summarized in algorithms  [ algokf1 ] and [ algokf2 ] .",
    "similar to other kalman filters , in prediction step ckf propagates the estimate from last time step to current time step and in update step it updates the estimate using collected measurements .",
    "similar to ukf , ckf also uses a weighted set of symmetric points to approximate the gaussian distribution .",
    "but the cubature - point set obtained in step 1 of algorithm [ algokf1 ] does not have a stem at the center and thus does not have the numerical instability problem of ukf discussed in section [ ukf ] .",

    "however , they inherently possess the theoretical , technical , and computational capabilities to perform good estimation of the power system s dynamic states . as for implementation , observers are simpler than kfs . for observers ,",
    "matrix gains are computed offline to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the estimation error .    here",

    "_ convergence guarantees : _ observers have theoretical guarantees for convergence while for kf there is no strict proof to guarantee that the estimation converges to actual states .",
    "* _ numerical stability : _ observers do not have numerical stability problems while the classic ukf can encounter numerical instability because the estimation error covariance matrix is not always guaranteed to be positive semi - definite . * _ tolerance to parametric uncertainty : _ kf - based methods can tolerate inaccurate parameters to some extent .",
    "dynamic observers deal with parametric uncertainty in the sense that all uncertainties can be augmented to the unknown input component in the state dynamics ( @xmath147 ) . * _ computational complexity : _ the ckf , ukf ( sr - ukf ) , and ekf all have computational complexity of @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "since the observers matrix gains are obtained offline by solving lmis , observers are easier to implement as only the dynamics are needed in the estimation .",
    "[ sec : conc ]    in this paper , we discuss different dse methods by presenting an overview of state - of - the - art estimation techniques and developing alternatives , including the cubature kalman filter and dynamic observers , to address major limitations of existing methods such as intolerance to inaccurate system model and malicious cyber attacks .",
    "the proposed methods are tested on a 16-machine 68-bus system , under significant model uncertainty and cyber attacks against the synchrophaosr measurements .",
    "it is shown that the ckf and the presented observer are more robust to model uncertainty and cyber attacks .",
    "based on both the theoretical , technical capabilities and the experimental results , we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of different estimation techniques especially for power system dse ."
