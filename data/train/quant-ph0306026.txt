    "currently , there are three main techniques to produce translationally cold molecules .",
    "the buffer gas @xcite and stark deceleration @xcite cooling schemes employ trapping of the low field seekers which requires the molecules to be in the appropriate internal states .",
    "cold molecules produced from photoassociation technique @xcite are usually vibrationally hot , occupying a number of high lying vibrational states .",
    "vibrational cooling schemes using optimal control of ultrashort pulses have been proposed @xcite .",
    "translationally cold molecules are useful for precision spectroscopy and measurements , molecular optics and interferometry as well as cold collisions studies , although they may be internally hot .",
    "it is also desirable to have translationally and internally cold molecules as well if the aim is to obtain molecular bose - einstein condensate @xcite . for the purpose of trapping ,",
    "the molecules need to be cooled internally .",
    "there has been no scheme to rotationally cool molecules although there are several methods of producing molecules in a single rotational state .",
    "a classic example is the electrostatic low - j selector which has been used for rotational state selection long ago @xcite .",
    "optical stern - gerlach has been demonstrated for atoms @xcite and molecular state selection by lasers has been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques are best applied to molecular beam .",
    "they are not cooling schemes since they do not employ a dissipative mechanism .",
    "supersonic expansion is based on dissipation and may also produce rotationally cold molecules , but can not be used to cool molecules which are already translationally cold since it requires high pressure and can only be applied mechanically on hot molecules . besides , for translationally cold molecules it is more efficient to employ dissipative process for internal cooling which avoids the loss of molecules .",
    "recently , we have proposed 1-d translational cooling schemes for molecules which rely on a single optical spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the schemes can be repeated for 3-d cooling if the 1-d cooled molecules can be brought back to the initial internal state again .",
    "molecules in excited rot - vibrational states can redistribute significant amount of the internal energy into the translation motion by state - changing inelastic collisions . at high temperature , this becomes a problem for trapping due to the increased collision rate .",
    "therefore , it is essential to removed the internal excitations by spontaneous emissions fast enough before the inelastic collisions occur .",
    "spontaneous emission carries away entropy to radiation while inelastic collision transfers entropy to the translational degree . for sufficiently dilute heteronuclear molecules ,",
    "vibrational cooling occur within @xmath0 timescale through infrared spontaneous emissions before the vibrational inelastic collisions take place .",
    "thus , the vibrational entropy is discarded as radiation entropy instead of the translational entropy .",
    "however , rotational spontaneous emissions can occur only in polar molecules and take much longer time , beyond the experimental timescale for dilute gas . for dense gas , rotational decay",
    "may be enhanced through many - body effect , but inelastic collision rate may become dominantly large .    in this paper , we propose a rotational cooling scheme for confined polar molecules .",
    "we use external electric field to tune the internal transitions into resonance with a lossy microwave cavity ( fig .",
    "[ rotcavetune ] ) .",
    "this enhances the rotational spontaneous emissions via the purcell effect @xcite whereby the populations are transferred to a lower rotational level in stages and eventually to the ground rotational level .",
    "the purcell effect has been experimentally demonstrated by goy et .",
    "al . using rydberg atoms in a microwave cavity @xcite .",
    "the cooling process requires long interaction time and we have proposed a method to confine the molecules within the cavity field .",
    "we consider a gas of polar diatomic molecules at thermal equilibrium temperature @xmath1  with the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we also assume that the gas is sufficiently dilute such that the inelastic collision is negligible throughout the cooling process . at below room temperature , the populations are essentially in the eigenenergy in the ground electronic state @xmath2 thus , the population and the eigenenergy in the vibrational state @xmath3 and rotational states @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( the total electronic angular momentum ) are given respectively by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the standard electronic , vibrational and rotational constants ( in wavenumber ) @xcite .    from eqs .",
    "[ initial pop ] and [ e ] , we estimate that for csf molecule with ( @xmath10)=(@xmath11)@xmath12 @xcite , only the first 5 rotational levels in the ground vibrational level ( @xmath13 ) are significantly occupied at temperature around @xmath14 . the rotational levels and the magnetic ( zeeman ) states for cases @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "the cavity must be able to support linearly polarized as well as circularly polarized photons corresponding to @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions respectively .",
    "if we assume that the cavity supports only linearly polarized photons , only the states with @xmath19 will be sequentially stark - tuned to cavity frequency by an external static electric field for enhanced spontaneous  decay toward the ground level .",
    "molecules in other states ( with @xmath20 ) are off - resonance with the cavity and their decays will not be enhanced . in this case",
    ", we will have to extract only the molecules in the states @xmath21 for rotational cooling .",
    "in this section , we elaborate on the rotational cooling scheme based on the proposed setup apparatus ( figure  [ rotcavetune ] ) .",
    "the spacings of rotational levels in polar diatomic molecules increase monotonically with energy levels .",
    "we use this monotonic property to bring the populations from the high @xmath22 levels to a low @xmath22 ( ground ) level by enhanced rotational decay in a _",
    "lossy _ microwave cavity .",
    "we want to bring each pair of transition ( @xmath4 to @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) into resonance with the cavity at each time , starting from the @xmath26 @xmath27 transition and ending with the @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 transition .",
    "we shall elaborate on the simplest scheme employing only the @xmath31-transitions ( @xmath32 ) ( figs .",

    "it enhances the spontaneous decay rate as @xmath53 however , it reduces the cooling efficiency since the decaying states can not be completely depopulated due to simultaneous incoherent excitations of the thermal photons .",
    "the usual way to reduce the thermal photons is by cooling of the apparatus . the inner surface of the apparatus is coated with microwave photon absorbing material like graphite while the outer surface can also be shielded with a photonic band - gap structure @xcite .",
    "thus , we can set @xmath54 and write the free space decay rate for @xmath31-transition @xmath55@xcite respectively as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the reduced electric dipole matrix element for the vibronic state , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the @xmath31-transition and @xmath33-transition respectively .      in order to enhance the decay of each transition",
    ", we can either tune the cavity or the levels into resonance with each other . in principle , we can construct a tunable cavity by changing the distance between the mirrors .",
    "first , the molecules are put into the cavity tuned to enhance the spontaneous emission of the highest rotational state , from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "then , the cavity is tuned to the next lower transition and so on until all the populations are brought to a single rovibrational state @xmath62 here , @xmath63 changes from @xmath64 to @xmath65 however , this approach is not very feasible in practice @xcite .",
    "it is more realistic to tune the transition levels into resonance with cavity frequency using an _ external electric field_. for @xmath66 transitions , photons are most likely to be emitted perpendicular to the dipole . to maximize the molecular dipole - cavity field coupling strength.and the spontaneous decay rate",
    ", the dipole should be parallel to the _ cavity electric field _",
    "( in x - y plane ) . therefore , the tuning electric field is applied along the _ x - axis _ so that it aligns the dipole along the cavity field ( see fig .",
    "[ rotcavetune ] ) . here",
    ", the @xmath67 transitions can be enhanced too as photons are emitted in all directions , although the most probable direction is parallel to the dipole .",
    "if the tuning electric field is along the _ cavity axis _ , the @xmath66 transition may not be optimumly enhanced because no photon is emitted exactly along the dipole . however , there is still some enhancement from off - axis modes because the microwave cavity is essentially a closed cavity which provides a large solid angle of mode confinement .",
    "a pair of closely spaced electrostatic plates can be introduced into the cavity to produce a tunable homogeneous transverse electric field @xmath68 perpendicular to the cavity axis ( say along x - direction ) for stark tuning .",
    "thus , the edges of the superconducting cavity mirrors can be shielded from the strong electric field using a metallic casing or coating to maintain a constant high @xmath41 value .",

    "higher order electrostatic poles can be used to confine the low field seekers with kinetic energy below about 1k @xcite .",
