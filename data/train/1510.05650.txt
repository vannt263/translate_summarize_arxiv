    "in this section , we present our approach for calculating the mass outflow rate of an outflow driven by momentum deposition from stellar feedback .",
    "crucially , we consider a turbulent ism in which a patch / disc of some mean gas surface density contains sub - patches with a range of gas surface densities .. all other quantities , such as the equilibrium sfr surface density , correspond to averages over the total patch / disc .",

    "we first present our criterion for determining which gas will be blown out on a coherence time ( i.e. before turbulence ` resets ' the density distribution ) , and we then discuss how we calculate the fraction of the ism mass that satisfies this criterion .",
    "as noted by tk14 , in a turbulent ism , a given patch of ism with mean gas surface density @xmath15 will contain sub - patches with a range of surface densities . for a sub - patch of ism with gas surface density @xmath16 to be expelled",
    ", it must be accelerated to the escape velocity of the disc , @xmath17 , within a coherence time . in turbulence ,",

    "vertical force balance requires that the largest eddies have scaleheight @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the local orbital frequency and @xmath25 is the characteristic turbulent velocity of the medium for eddies with @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath16 is the gas volume density integrated in the vertical direction , we are considering _ only _ patches integrated through the disc ( i.e. with minimum individual size @xmath27 ) .",
    "moreover , because the large scales contain all the power in density fluctuations , we are primarily concerned with eddies with @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we obtain the typical coherence time @xmath28 , and we therefore require @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the momentum deposition rate and @xmath31 is the mass of the patch of ism . for a disc in radial centrifugal balance in an isothermal potential with circular velocity @xmath32 ,",

    "thus , the surface density below which gas will be accelerated to the escape velocity on a coherence time and thus blown out is @xmath44    the above framework assumes that the outflows are momentum - driven .",
    "the fiducial value @xmath45 is based on the assumption that sn remnants go through the energy - conserving sedov - taylor @xcite phase in which energy is converted into momentum .",
    "the reason that the outflows can be considered momentum - driven is that we assume that by the time the outflows ` break out ' of the disc , the energy - conserving phase has ended ( see fqh13 for details ) .",
    "this assumption is justified as long as the cooling radii of the supernova ejecta are less than the disc scaleheight .",
    "if this condition does not hold ( i.e. a supernova remnant expands to of order the disc scaleheight or greater while still in the sedov - taylor phase ) , the outflows should be treated as energy - conserving .",
    "we can estimate when this assumption will be violated as follows .",
    "the cooling radius for an individual supernova remnant is @xmath46 @xcite , where @xmath47 is the number density of the ambient medium ; we have ignored the weak metallicity dependence .",
    "the disc scaleheight is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the sound speed .",
    "using the relation @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the proton mass , the cooling radius can be expressed as @xmath52 the cooling radius is greater than the disc scaleheight , @xmath53 , when @xmath54 thus , we expect energetically driven outflows to be significant only when the local gas surface density ( i.e. the gas surface density averaged over the cooling radius ) is @xmath55 pc@xmath1 . because patches with such low surface density will almost always be below our calculated critical surface density , we will include this material in the outflowing material , and the actual driving method is irrelevant for the purposes of calculating the outflow fraction .",
    "it is certainly possible for this condition to be satisfied in the outer regions of discs or if the surface density of the local ism has already been reduced considerably by other forms of feedback or other supernovae before a supernova explodes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , even if it is possible for supernova ejecta to escape the galaxy while still in the energy - conserving phase , the expected mass loading is factor is small because little material will be entrained ; thus , the amount of outflowing gas will be of order the supernova ejecta mass . for standard initial mass functions , on average , each supernova ejects of order 10 @xmath56 , and there is approximately one supernova per @xmath57 formed @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the mass - loading factor to be @xmath58 , and indeed , numerical simulations of energy - driven outflows from supernovae suggest that very little mass is blown out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , we neglect this form of feedback in the current work .",
    "we now calculate the fraction of the ism with @xmath59 by considering the distribution of gas surface density in a turbulent ism , closely following the analysis of tk14 . for supersonic isothermal turbulence ,",

    "this decrease in @xmath8 occurs because the gas fractions of massive galaxies decrease below the critical value at which @xmath61 decreases exponentially ( see ) .",
    "in contrast , in low - mass ( @xmath213 ) galaxies , @xmath8 is high and approximately redshift - independent at all redshifts because these galaxies are sufficiently gas - rich even at @xmath13 .    for galaxies with @xmath12 , the redshift evolution in the @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath197 relation is weak .",
    "the reason is as follows : recall that @xmath214 . the galaxy circular velocity (",
    "unlike the halo circular velocity ) at fixed @xmath197 is independent of redshift .",
    "the outflow fraction depends only weakly on the gas fraction as long as @xmath215 ( which holds for these galaxies according to our assumed empirical relation ) , and the decrease in @xmath61 with decreasing @xmath134 is approximately canceled by the @xmath216 term .",
    "thus , for galaxies with @xmath12 , @xmath8 scales as @xmath217 with a normalization that is approximately independent of redshift .",
    "the agreement between our predictions and the simulation results of @xcite is impressive , especially given the simplicity of our model . in particular ,",
    "a novel feature of our model is that it explains the suppression of outflows in massive galaxies at low redshift .",
    "this cutoff occurs because at low redshift , the gas fraction and thus mean gas surface density of massive galaxies decreases considerably .",
    "consequently , the turbulent velocity expected from self - regulation decreases , and thus both @xmath60 and the mach number decrease .",
    "the fraction of the ism that can be accelerated to the escape velocity on a dynamical time becomes negligible , and outflows are suppressed .",
    "we discuss the implications of this suppression below .",
    "we have demonstrated that our model predicts that the fiducial scaling @xmath157 will not hold for all star - forming galaxies because in our model , @xmath218 .",
    "thus , even if we assume that @xmath219 ( which , as we discuss below , is a simplification ) , the @xmath157 scaling can be altered by variations in @xmath134 ( or equivalently @xmath25 ) and @xmath61 ( which is determined by the values of @xmath83 , @xmath134 , @xmath32 , and the diffuse ism temperature ) .",
    "consequently , models that assume a fixed @xmath157 relation ( or , more generally , any model that assumes that @xmath8 depends on a single global property , such as @xmath32 ) may miss some important physical effects and artificially reduce the dispersion in galaxy properties because variations in @xmath134 at fixed @xmath32 will directly lead to variations in @xmath8 at fixed @xmath32 .",
    "for example , suppose that a galaxy s gas fraction is temporarily lower than the quasi - equilibrium value .",
    "this could occur because of the stochastic nature of gas accretion from the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or because the galaxy is in a post - burst state and its gas fraction has not returned to the steady - state value set by the balance of inflow and outflow . in standard models ,",
    "the galaxy s mass - loading factor would remain approximately constant ( assuming that @xmath32 is approximately constant ) , so its outflow rate would decrease by the same factor as its sfr .",
    "thus , the galaxy s gas content would continue to be depleted by star formation and outflows at a rate of @xmath220 and would need an inflow rate greater than this value in order for its gas fraction to become high again .",
    "in contrast , in our model , if the gas fraction becomes sufficiently low ( @xmath221 ) , the mass - loading factor is exponentially suppressed , and the depletion rate becomes equal to the sfr alone .",
    "thus , as long as the inflow rate is greater than the sfr , the gas fraction will increase until the galaxy re - enters the high - outflow regime .",
    "the difference between these two depletion / required infall rates can be dramatic in @xmath12 galaxies , for which @xmath222 .",
    "this example illustrates that assuming a pure @xmath157 scaling without accounting for the cutoff that we demonstrate can artificially prevent low - mass galaxies from accumulating fresh gas and artificially suppress the variability of star formation .    the behavior can also differ in periods in which the gas surface density has been driven higher than the equilibrium value , e.g. because of an interaction .",
    "as the ism is compressed , the sfr and thus outflow rate will increase .",
    "assuming @xmath157 and @xmath177 , for fixed @xmath32 , the mass outflow rate surface density scales as @xmath223 .",
    "however , our model predicts that in both regimes , all else being equal , @xmath224 .",
    "@xmath61 increases with @xmath14 , but this increase is weak if the galaxy already has high @xmath61 ( i.e. if @xmath60 is not in the low-@xmath16 tail of the surface density pdf ) .",
    "suppose that this is the case and thus @xmath61 is approximately constant ( otherwise , arguments similar to those in the previous paragraph apply ) .",
    "then , @xmath225 .",
    "consequently , models that assume fixed @xmath157 scalings will tend to have greater outflow rates in starbursts than predicted by our model .",
    "these stronger outflow rates would result in artificial suppression of starbursts in such models .",
    "this effect may partially explain why large - volume cosmological simulations such as illustris @xcite do not exhibit strong starbursts @xcite , whereas galaxies in the fire simulations have sfrs that can vary by multiple orders of magnitude on 100-myr timescales @xcite , although resolution is another crucial difference between these two types of simulations .",
    "we note that suppression of starbursts is especially undesirable because they are critical for making realistic bulges @xcite .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , our model predicts that massive galaxies transition from being highly turbulent , clumpy discs that exhibit strong outflows at high redshift to well - ordered discs characterised by weak or non - existent outflows at low redshift because their gas fractions decrease below a critical value of @xmath148 .",
    "suppose that the product @xmath226 ( or equivalently @xmath200 ) decreases below the critical value such that @xmath61 is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the subsequent evolution depends critically on the gas inflow rate : if the gas inflow rate is greater than the sfr , the galaxy will accumulate gas ( because @xmath227 ) , @xmath226 will increase above the critical value , the galaxy will reenter the quasi - equilibrium state , and @xmath8 will return to the equilibrium value .",
    "thus , at high redshift , when gas inflow rates are high , the quasi - equilibrium can be maintained , and galaxy evolution should be characterized by bursts of star formation ( because of stochasticity in the inflow rate and mergers ) and strong outflows . however , if the gas supply is insufficient to drive @xmath226 back above the critical value , then the galaxy will enter a steady mode of star formation in which @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that galaxies with @xmath7 transition to this regime by @xmath13 , whereas lower - mass galaxies remain in the high-@xmath8 regime .",
    "this transition is potentially critical for the ability to form a thin , cold molecular ( and hence young stellar ) disc . in many sams and cosmological simulations",
    ", it is challenging to suppress early star formation , as is necessary to form disc galaxies without overly massive bulges , without destroying discs and over - suppressing star formation at @xmath229 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow model that we present here provides a natural mechanism to address this problem , and the results of the fire simulations support this explanation .",
    "we have argued that galaxies self - regulate to maintain a quasi - equilibrium state in which @xmath230 globally . the reader may object that this is inconsistent with observations of ` clumpy ' galaxies at @xmath231 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we stress that this does not mean that all regions of a galaxy have @xmath230 , and in fact , our model relies on overdense sub - patches of a galaxy having @xmath232 ; these patches would correspond to the observed massive star - forming clumps .",
    "patches with @xmath232 collapse , form stars , and inject momentum into the surrounding ism , thereby maintaining a global @xmath83 of order unity .",
    "even if it is possible for galaxies to have @xmath232 globally , and thus be ( temporarily ) globally unstable , our model can be applied because we have retained the @xmath83 dependences in all expressions .",
    "because @xmath61 depends on the product @xmath226 , a galaxy with global @xmath233 and gas fraction @xmath234 will have the same @xmath61 as a galaxy with @xmath219 and gas fraction @xmath235 .",
    "for fixed @xmath61 , @xmath134 , and @xmath32 , @xmath236 .",
    "if @xmath226 is sufficiently high that @xmath61 is approximately constant , a galaxy a with global @xmath232 would have a greater outflow rates than a stable galaxy with the same @xmath134 and @xmath32 values , which would tend to drive the unstable galaxy back toward stability .",
    "however , if the global @xmath83 is low enough that @xmath226 is less than the critical value at which @xmath61 is exponentially cutoff , outflows will be suppressed , and the galaxy will unstably fragment until the gas surface density is reduced by star formation to the value required to achieve @xmath219 . whether the galaxy will again exhibit strong outflows will depend on the subsequent evolution of @xmath226 .",
    "it is clear that our model predictions should differ from those of the types of models currently employed in large - volume cosmological simulations and sams .",

    "we have presented an analytic model for how stellar feedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives outflows in a turbulent ism .",
    "the model is based on two fundamental assumptions : ( 1 ) star formation is self - regulating : at high surface density , the momentum input from star formation drives turbulence and supports the disc against gravitational collapse ; at low surface density , when turbulence is subdominant , photo - heating stabilizes the disc .",

    "the reason for this suppression is that when the turbulent velocity dispersion is low relative to the circular velocity , only patches with surface densities significantly less than the mean can be blown out . however , because of the low @xmath200 , the ism is relatively smooth , and a negligible fraction of the ism mass is contained in patches with surface density less than the critical value .",

    "this redshift independence occurs because the mass - loading factor depends on the galaxy circular velocity , not the halo circular velocity .",

    "we predict that this suppression of outflows is necessary for the emergence of steadily star - forming , stable , thin molecular gas ( and thus young stellar ) discs .",
    "because the critical gas fraction is @xmath148 , only moderately massive , low - redshift galaxies can form such discs .",
    "galaxies in which outflows are not suppressed should be characterised by cycles of starbursts , outflows , and quenched periods .",
