    "in the last few years complex network theory has attracted the interest of a widespread audience as a powerful tool to analyze complex relational structures and to represent big data @xcite .",
    "+ network analysis usually deals with a massive amount of data that requires to be managed and organized efficiently in order to extract as much information as possible , reducing the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "one of the most important methodologies to tackle this issue is the identification of network communities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "_ community detection _ allows us to extract sub - networks which exhibit different properties from the aggregate properties of the whole network and also to investigate information on groups of nodes with similar characteristics which are more likely to be connected to each other .",
    "communities are usually defined as subsets of nodes that are densely connected , i.e. , they are more connected among themselves than to the rest of the network . however , in many network applications , there is a meaningful group structure which does not coincide with the partition into dense communities : indeed , the groups may be characterized by similar patterns of interactions with other groups @xcite . within this context , _ positional analysis _",
    "is particularly interesting since it deals with the identification of actors who occupy an equivalent position in a system , i.e. play a similar role in the considered organization . differently to the community detection where the clusters are represented by densely connected groups of actors , positional analysis aims at studying relational data in order to cluster the actors into some classes such that the elements of the same class occupy equivalent positions in the system . in order to illustrate the distinction between positional analysis and community detection ,",
    "let us consider the following example of the e - mails sent among the employees of a company : it may be that we are able to identify different communities of individuals among which e - mails are more frequently exchanged .",
    "however , densely connected employees may occupy different positions in the organization and we need to run a positional analysis if we are interested in identifying groups of actors with equivalent positions .",
    "+ in this work we aim at identifying clusters of `` positional equivalent '' actors in cases where the available data are the relationships defined among actors on one side and some features on the other one @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , instead of interpersonal relationships . basically , the idea is that positions in a network structure can be defined according to the characteristics or behaviours that the actors exhibit , instead of the relationships that actors hold with other actors .",
    "individual to attribute relations can be represented as a _ weighted bipartite network _ where the edge - weights represent the level to which actors show a particular feature .",
    "more precisely , a network is bipartite if its nodes can be divided into two sets in such a way that every edge connects a node in one set to a node in the other one @xcite .",
    "bipartite networks are thus very useful for representing data in which the elements under scrutiny belong to two categories ( typically referred to as actors , or agents , and features , respectively ) , and we want to understand how the elements in one category are associated with those in the other one .",
    "notable examples that have been analyzed include networks of company directors and the board of directors on which they sit @xcite , @xcite , scientific collaboration networks @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , networks of documents and words @xcite , as well as network of genes and genetic sequences @xcite .",
    "+ the widespread approach to partition bipartite networks consists of applying standard community detection algorithms , such as the girvan - newman modularity @xcite , to the one - mode projection of the original network .",
    "consider two types of nodes , say _ a _ and _ b _ , in a one - mode projection of the bipartite network , nodes of the same type , say _ a _ , are connected to each other if they share a common node of the other type , say _",
    "b_. for instance , in the ceo network , two ceos are connected if they both sit in the same board .",
    "although the one - mode projection procedure can give some insights on the topological properties of the network , at the same time it can imply the lost of relevant information . in fact , different bipartite networks may reduce to the same one - mode projection , and thus a clustering based on the latter may produce unreliable or incorrect results , as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "regardless of those critiques , in @xcite the authors argue that under some circumstances , using multiple projections , the information extracted with this procedure is sound , and therefore the simplicity of this approach can be still exploited .",
    "however , several authors tried to solve this problem by defining measures and algorithms that could be directly applied to the original matrix associated to the bipartite network .",
    "+ in the physics community , two different definitions of bipartite modularity have been proposed , @xcite , @xcite . both concepts extend the girvan - newman modularity , but pose different assumptions on the null model taken as the benchmark in the metric used for the module identification .",
    "they return good results compared to the one - mode projection , but their applicability is restricted to the case of binary bipartite networks .",
    "+ some applications of bipartite networks refer to affiliation networks @xcite , which capture social relationships , such as membership or event participation .",
    "positional analysis is well established in social network literature , where the usual approach consists of applying the standard measures of structural or regular equivalence , and the related algorithms , to the one mode - projection of the affiliation network @xcite .",
    "however , affiliation networks represent only a very special case of bipartite networks since the associated matrices are binary .",
    "+ other proposed methods for bipartite network clustering , that are mostly used by sociologists , are based on blockmodeling ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the key idea of this approach is that the rows and the columns of the matrix associated to the bipartite network can be partitioned simultaneously by means of a criterion function , which measures the inconsistencies of the empirical blocks with the ideal ones .",
    "therefore , blockmodeling works directly on the matrix by trying to permute rows and columns in order to fit , as closely as possible , idealized pictures .",
    "the differences between the various types of blockmodeling techniques concern the definition of the ideal blocks and the criterion functions .",
    "blockmodeling is mostly applied to binary data , but it can also be exploited for weighted matrices ( valued blockmodeling and homogeneity blockmodeling @xcite ) .",
    "however , with the valued blockmodeling , information about the values above a pre - specified parameter is lost and a problem is to determine appropriately the value of this parameter .",
    "the homogeneity blockmodeling does not require any additional parameters to be set in advance and it uses all available information , but its main disadvantage is that it can consider only a few possible ideal blocks .",
    "+ in @xcite , the authors proposed a bipartite stochastic block model where a parametric probabilistic structure is given , and the clusters are identified by solving the inference problem of finding the parameters that best fit the observed network . in particular , they model the generating process of the number of edges between two nodes of different types with a poisson distribution with a certain intensity parameter .",
    "the authors show that their method outperforms the one - mode projection approach .",
    "nevertheless , it does not deal with the case when we have weights on the edges . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors try to go in this direction by proposing a stochastic block model for edge - weighted networks , but their method requires to choose the number of clusters ( as in most stochastic block models ) . + the algorithm we propose realizes a partition of `` positional equivalent '' actors based on the entire information enclosed in the weighted bipartite network that describes their characteristics or behaviours .",
    "the main contribution of our work is twofold .",
    "first , we develop a new methodological approach according to which actors are grouped with respect to their intrinsic multivariate stochastic dependence structure . in this framework ,",
    "not only the magnitude of a single weight matters but the whole pattern of the values the actors show along all the features is relevant for the classification .",
    "second , we propose a new clustering procedure that exploits the potentiality of copula functions , a mathematical instrument for the modelization of the multivariate stochastic dependence structure .",
    "in particular , copulas allow us to group actors according to their underlying dependence structure , without any assumption on their one - dimensional marginal distributions , and to take into account various kinds of stochastic dependence structures among actors .",
    "moreover , there is no need to predefine the target number of clusters .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows . in sections",
    "[ our ] and [ procedure ] , we describe our approach , together with the mathematical tool we employ , and then we illustrate our clustering procedure . in sections [ simul ] and [ data ]",
    "we show the performance of our clustering algorithm applying it to simulated and real data .",
    "finally , in section [ fine ] we conclude with a discussion of the potentiality of our method and possible future applications and extensions .",
    "as explained in the previous section , we consider the general setting where we have an @xmath0 real - valued matrix , that collects the information on the connections that go from a set of @xmath1 actors to a set of @xmath2 items , representing some features or behaviours .",
    "the elements of such a matrix can be any real numbers , with zero representing the absence of a relationship and a non - zero value representing the presence of a relationships , together with its intensity . as an example , this framework can be used to analyse situations where we have actors on one side and personal qualities or interests on the other side , and the weighted - edges between the two sets can be used to represents the level to which an individual shows a certain quality or interest .",
    "another example may be a set of individuals in a supermarket and the set of products they buy . in this case ,",
    "an edge represent whether an individual bought a particular product or not , and its value gives the amount of product bought or its cost .",
    "+ against this background , we want to emphasize that actors may be classified into positions based on their patterns of characteristics , interests or behaviours that they exhibit and on the intensity wherewith the actors show them , instead of the kind of relationships that they keep with other actors . in other words , we move in the direction that the dependence ( we mean positive dependence , i.e. similarity ) in the expression levels of the considered features is related to the position that the actors occupy in the system .",
    "hence , we say that some actors are _ positional equivalent _ if they show a significant dependence structure that join them . in this framework , the use of the traditional one - mode projection methods would be meaningless and misleading and also blockmodeling or modularity approaches adapted to bipartite networks could not give a clear answer to the problem because they are not well tailor made for the analysis of weighted bipartite networks .",
    "+ our purpose is to identify clusters of actors by means of the detection , from the original matrix , of some statistically significant dependencies among groups of actors .",
    "basically , our assumption is that actors within a system have an underlying multivariate stochastic dependence structure which generates the data . in order to identify this intrinsic dependence structure ,",
    "we propose to exploit the mathematical copula theory .",
    "+ the concept of copula was introduced during the forties and the fifties with hoeffding @xcite and sklar @xcite , but the evidence of a growing interest in this kind of functions in statistics started only in the nineties @xcite .",
    "copulas are functions that join or `` couple '' multivariate distribution functions to their one - dimensional marginal distributions .",
    "more precisely , we have the following definition and results .",
    "a @xmath3-dimensional copula @xmath4 is a function defined on @xmath5^d$ ] with values in @xmath5 $ ] , which satisfies the following three properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 for every @xmath7 and @xmath8 $ ] ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath9 for at least one @xmath10 , then @xmath11 ; 3 .   for every @xmath12^d$",
    "] with @xmath13 for all @xmath10 , @xmath14 where , for each @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the advantage of the copula functions and the reason why they are used in the dependence modeling is related to the sklar s theorem @xcite .",
    "it essentially states that every multivariate cumulative distribution function can be rewritten in terms of the margins , i.e. the marginal cumulative distribution functions , and a copula .",
    "let @xmath17 be a multivariate cumulative distribution function with margins @xmath18 .",
    "then there exists a copula @xmath19^d \\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] such that , for every @xmath20 $ ] , we have @xmath21 if the margins @xmath22 are all continuous , then @xmath23 is unique ; otherwise @xmath23 is uniquely determined on @xmath24 .",
    "+ conversely , if @xmath23 is a copula and @xmath25 are cumulative distribution functions , then @xmath17 defined by ( [ sklar - eq ] ) is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with margins @xmath25 .    in the case when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the marginal probability density functions associated to @xmath17 and @xmath22 , respectively , the copula density @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 there are different families of copula functions that capture different aspects of the dependence structure : positive and negative dependence , symmetry , heaviness of tail dependence and so on . in our work ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the principal copula functions of the archimedean family ( namely , gumbel , clayton and frank copulas , see appendix [ copula ] for their definitions ) , which model , through a unique parameter @xmath30 , situations with different degrees of dependence .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth to note that the application of our methodology is not restricted to those copula functions .",
    "in this section we present a copula - based technique that realizes a partition of actors into clusters so that the actors belonging to the same cluster show a significant dependence structure that allows us to classify them as being `` positional equivalent '' .",
    "our approach is inspired by the work of di lascio and giannerini @xcite , which introduced and studied a copula - based clustering algorithm , called coclust , in the framework of microarray data in genetics .",
    "as they did , we use copula functions in order to model the multivariate stochastic dependence structure among groups of actors and we apply the maximized log - likelihood function criterion for the detection of the different clusters . notwithstanding , our algorithm presents the following important differences with respect to the one proposed by di lascio and giannerini :    * while they assume independence within clusters and dependence between clusters , we look for clusters of dependent actors ; * while they first find the optimal number @xmath31 of clusters and then perform sequential extractions of @xmath31 actors , where at each time one actor is added to each cluster in a certain way , we do not use a sequential extraction method but we directly look for the optimal partition of the actors into clusters ; * differently from them , we allow clusters to be of different sizes and we allocate all the actors into the clusters ; * whereas they assume identity in distribution for actors inside a certain cluster , i.e. each cluster identifies one margin , we do not make this assumption and we estimate for each actor his own cumulative distribution function",
    ".    given @xmath1 actors and @xmath2 items , we can represent the data that describe the relationships between actors and items with a real - valued matrix of dimension @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the value of the item @xmath35 for the actor @xmath10 . with the language of network theory , this matrix can be seen as the matrix associated to a weighted bipartite network .",
    "+ the procedure we propose takes as input this matrix and returns the optimal decomposition into clusters after the following four steps :    1 .",
    "first of all , we find the empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath36 of every actor @xmath10 based on the corresponding @xmath2-dimensional row @xmath37 of the items . for each actor @xmath10",
    ", we are taking the values @xmath38 of the @xmath2 items as i.i.d .",
    "realizations drawn from the same univariate distribution . + 2 .",
    "the second step consists in the estimation of the copula objective function for each possible group @xmath39 of actors , with @xmath40 , using pseudo - maximum likelihood estimation in order to estimate the dependence parameter .",
    "thus , for each possible group , say @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , of actors , we maximize the log - likelihood function defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the parametric expression for the chosen copula density , and we find the value @xmath45 such that @xmath46 note that we are taking the vectors @xmath47 as @xmath2 i.i.d .",
    "realizations drawn from the same @xmath48-variate distribution .",
    "3 .   in the third step",
    ", we consider the set @xmath49 of all possible partitions of the @xmath1 actors that do not contain clusters with a single actor .",
    "hence , each @xmath50 in @xmath49 is formed by a certain number of clusters @xmath51 with @xmath52 . the set @xmath49 represents the set of all possible decompositions into clusters that the procedure can return actors , numbered from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the set @xmath49 is formed by the following partitions : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . ] .",
    "namely , we find the maximum value of the map defined on @xmath49 by @xmath59 4",
    ".   finally , the procedure returns @xmath60 such that @xmath61 more precisely , it returns the clusters that form @xmath62 in a decreasing order with respect to the value @xmath45 of each cluster @xmath39 in @xmath62 .",
    "the r code for this procedure is available at http://riccaboni.weebly.com/code.html .",
    "in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm , we conducted some simulation experiments .",
    "we considered different scenarios and , for each of them , various values of @xmath2 ( i.e. the number of items ) : @xmath63 or @xmath64 . for each scenario and each value of @xmath2 , we generated @xmath65 random samples of @xmath66 observations ( actors ) , grouped into @xmath67 clusters .",
    "specifically , we simulated the following scenarios :    1 .   in the first three scenarios ,",
    "clusters were generated using standard gaussian margins and the same copula type : one scenario with gumbel , another with clayton and another one with frank .",
    "two of the clusters had @xmath67 observations ( actors ) and the dependence parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the last one had @xmath54 observations ( actors ) with dependence parameter @xmath69 .",
    "2 .   in the second three scenarios ,",
    "we generate the clusters using discrete marginal distribution , namely the poisson distribution with parameter @xmath70 , and the same copula type : one scenario with gumbel , another with clayton and another one with frank .",
    "two clusters had @xmath67 observations ( actors ) and dependence parameter @xmath68 , while the third one had @xmath54 observations ( actors ) with dependence parameter @xmath69 .",
    "3 .   in the last three scenarios",
    ", we decided to draw the observations from different margins and using the same copula type : one scenario with gumbel , another with clayton and another one with frank .",
    "in particular , the first two clusters had dependence parameter @xmath68 and respectively , pareto(1,2 ) and lognormal(0,1 ) marginal distributions .",
    "instead , in the third cluster the dependence parameter was @xmath69 with exponential(0.5 ) marginal distribution .    for each considered scenario and each value of @xmath2 , we tested the algorithm applying the same copula used for the simulation of the data .",
    "moreover , for the first three scenarios and each value of @xmath2 , we also applied the algorithm with the other two copula types than the one used for simulations .",
    "+ we observed that the choice of the copula for the algorithm has no great effect on the performance of the algorithm and the results seem quite good , especially in the case when @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "some main remarks can be made :    * first of all , under all the possible scenarios , for @xmath71 or @xmath72 , we always got a @xmath73 percentage of successes in recognizing the clusters correctly . *",
    "second , when the observations are drawn from the gumbel and the clayton copulas , we got a percentage of successes equal to @xmath73 already for @xmath74 and between @xmath75 and @xmath73 for @xmath76 . * finally , when the observations are drawn from the frank copula , we notice some problems for @xmath76 . indeed , for this copula type , @xmath77 realizations are too few to generate an evident dependence structure and so the algorithm does not work well in recognized it .",
    "however , we observed a fast improvement for @xmath2 getting larger and , starting from @xmath74 , we can say that the percentage of successes are good ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "in this section , we describe two applications of our algorithm to real datasets . the first one deals with a real - valued bipartite network .",
    "the second one refers to a widely studied social network that is described by a signed network .",
    "the first application we show is based on the baci - comtrade dataset , featuring the amounts of import - export trades among several countries in the world .",
    "we extracted a _ weighted bipartite network _ taking the export dollar values for the @xmath79 product categories of the hs2 classification , for selected @xmath80 countries , in the year @xmath81 .",
    "more in details , we decided to select the countries according to their economies , in order to identify @xmath67 hypothetical categories :    * a _ first world _ category composed by france , germany , canada and united states ; * a _ third world _ category represented by burundi , zimbabwe , liberia and somalia ; * an _ opec representative _ category made by kuwait , saudi arabia , qatar and iran .",
    "we applied our procedure to the matrix , where the countries were in rows , the products in columns , and each cell contained the gross export value of a given country for a given product .",
    "our aim was to create clusters of countries which are similar ( i.e. positional equivalent in the international trade network ) with respect to the products they export .",
    "much of the literature that focuses on international trade looks for community detection , that is for communities of countries with a high number of connections among them , while being relatively less interconnected with countries outside the community they are part of @xcite . differently from the classical clustering analysis in international trade , we tried to define `` positional equivalent '' countries based on the products they trade and not on the basis of the countries wherewith they trade .",
    "indeed , we were not interested in finding dense communities of countries for different commodities , but we wanted to identify countries that cover the same position in the trade network since they present a similarity in their exports .",
    "+ the result we obtained is reported in table [ table : trade ] .",
    "as we can see , the algorithm is able to perfectly recognize the above mentioned country groups .",
    "however , since these groups were built according to a subjective judgement , we decided to analyze the data in order to provide a more robust explanation for the clusters we found . in table",
    "[ table : selection ] we report for each country , the percentage on the total amount of export categories . ] for a selection of @xmath82 hs2 categories out of the @xmath83 available , in order to give some hints on the trade joint patterns that our algorithm recognize .",
    "overall , we can agree on the fact that the result is coherent with the observed data . regarding the _ first world _ category",
    ", we can see that at least a small amount of their total exports is allocated in each selected categories and about the @xmath84 of their total export is concentrated in the nine categories , corresponding to the following commodities : * 84 * - nuclear reactors , boilers , machinery and mechanicals appliances ; * 87 * - vehicles ; * 88 * - aircraft and spacecraft ; * 85 * - electrical machinery , telecommunications equipment , sound and television recorders ; * 30 * - pharmaceutical products ; * 90 * - optical , photographic , cinematographic , measuring , checking , precision , medical instruments . + conversely , for the _ opec representative _ group , it is clear that the nature of the dependence arises from the fact that more than the @xmath85 of the total export of these countries belongs to the following three categories : * 27 * - mineral , fuels , oils ; * 29 * - organic chemicals ; * 39 * - plastic and articles thereof .",
    "nonetheless , we underline that our algorithm did not recognize this cluster just because of the large share of export these countries have in these few products , but it captured the whole dependence between these countries and so also the categories in which they do not trade , or trade a little , play an important role .",
    "this is clear by looking at the network structure for the _ third world _",
    "category in the last four columns of table [ table : selection ] .",
    "as it can be seen , all these countries present a huge amount of the total export in a few specific commodities .",
    "for example , more than the @xmath75 of the somalian export is in category * 1 * - live animals , while the @xmath86 of the burundian export is in category * 9 * - coffee , tea , mate and spices .",
    "thus , we can affirm that these countries present a highly specific production and the dependence among them arise not as a consequence of the products in which they trade but rather from the products in which they do not trade . by looking carefully at table [ table :",
    "selection ] , it is possible to notice that for most of the selected 21 hs2 categories , the share of export is almost zero in all these _ third world _ countries . in this sense",
    ", they are similar to the _ opec representative _ countries but , as we already said , the latter present a specific dependence deriving from the common commodities they trade .",
    "finally , _ canada _ deserves some comments .",
    "it has an high value in category * 27 * as the countries in the _ opec representative _ category , but its values for the other categories are more similar to those of the _ first world _ than the ones of the _ opec representative _ group .",
    "our algorithm is able to capture this aspect .",
    "+ an insight of all these distinguishing features between the clusters can also be grasped looking at figure ( [ figure : trade ] ) , where we report for each country a coloured bar with the export shares for each of the 97 hs2 product categories over the total amount of export , and figure ( [ figure : tradenet ] ) , where we depict the bipartite trade network between the countries and 15 macro - categories of the hs2 products classification .",
    ".trade data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : justice ]     [ figure : judges ]",
    "clustering algorithms have increasingly assumed a central role for the identification of communities in complex networks . in this paper",
    ", we deal with a notion of community different from the classical one : while the network clustering analysis , namely the community detection , aims to identify clusters of densely connected actors , we try to determine groups of actors that play a similar role inside a certain organization basing on the characteristics or habits that they exhibit . in the social network literature , this is known as positional analysis .",
    "+ to this end , we propose a new clustering algorithm that can be applied to situations which are suitably modelled through a _ weighted bipartite network_. starting from the associated real - valued matrix , with the actors on the rows , the features on the columns , and the weights as the elements , we try to capture possible similarities among groups of actors by analyzing the multivariate stochastic dependence among them .",
    "+ the contribution of this paper has to be found in the novelty of the methodological approach we propose for positional analysis that is based on the detection of the intrinsic multivariate stochastic dependence among groups of actors and in the development of a related algorithm that uses copula functions in order to model these dependence structures .",
    "furthermore , this algorithm directly operates on the matrix describing the actor - feature relationships , differently from many other algorithms that collapse the information of the bipartite network to a unipartite one and then apply the classical clustering procedure .",
    "in fact , this kind of operation can cause a lost of information and a consequent erroneous cluster identification .",
    "another advantage of our technique is that it finds the optimal partition , without fixing _ a priori _ the number of clusters and/or the number of elements per cluster ( as , on the contrary , for other clustering algorithms ) .",
    "furthermore , our algorithm is able to work directly on any matrix , binary or weighted with real numbers .",
    "+ this is the first attempt of application of this methodology to the network field and so it is not surprising that there is still a issue to be addressed and that we leave for future research .",
    "indeed , the major drawback of our algorithm concerns the high computational burden that it bears , as a consequence of the fact that it explores all the possible combinations of groups of actors . since our first purpose was to understand the potentiality of such a new approach , we have not tried to develop any optimized version of our algorithm yet .",
    "however , we are convinced that a deeper computational study of the behaviour of the algorithm will give some insights on a possible criterion that could be exploited for a reduction of the exploration procedure .",
    "from a first glance , our suggestion to tackle this issue is to adopt an agglomerative or a divisive approach as it is commonly used in the community detection literature , based on some threshold on the log - likelihood function .",
    "in such a case , the log - likelihood function could be computed only for those groups of actors for which there is an interest with a consequent reduction of the computational burden .    * acknowledgment * the authors acknowledge support from cnr pnr project `` crisis lab '' and from the miur ( firb project rbfr12ba3y ) . moreover , irene crimaldi is a member of the `` gruppo nazionale per lanalisi matematica , la probabilit e le loro applicazioni ( gnampa ) '' of the `` istituto nazionale di alta matematica ( indam ) '' .",

    "<S> in this work we are interested in identifying clusters of `` positional equivalent '' actors , i.e. actors who play a similar role in a system . in particular , we analyze weighted bipartite networks that describes the relationships between actors on one side and features or traits on the other , together with the intensity level to which actors show their features . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution of our work is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we develop a methodological approach that takes into account the underlying multivariate dependence among groups of actors . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that positions in a network could be defined on the basis of the similar intensity levels that the actors exhibit in expressing some features , instead of just considering relationships that actors hold with each others . </S>",
    "<S> second , we propose a new clustering procedure that exploits the potentiality of copula functions , a mathematical instrument for the modelization of the stochastic dependence structure . </S>",
    "<S> our clustering algorithm can be applied both to binary and real - valued matrices . </S>",
