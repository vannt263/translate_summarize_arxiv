    "traffic on networked systems is important for many modern communication and transportation systems . since the discovery of small - world phenomenon @xcite , and scale - free property @xcite , it is widely proved that the topology and degree distribution of networks have profound effects on the processes taking place on these networks , including traffic flow @xcite .",
    "routing is the control mechanism that directs each commuter in a networked system from its source to destination through a serial of switching nodes .",
    "a good routing strategy can improve network traffic efficiency without changing the underlying infrastructures @xcite . therefore , adopting efficient routing strategies are often preferred by the engineers . in modern communication and transportation systems ,",
    "the shortest path protocol is often used .",
    "however , the shortest paths often lead to the collapse of hub nodes , which greatly reduces system performance . to avoid this problem ,",
    "some routing strategies are proposed .",
    "one good example is the efficient routing strategy @xcite .",
    "the efficient path between any pair of nodes is defined as the path that the sum degree of nodes is minimum , denoted as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the degree of @xmath2th node along the path , @xmath3 is the path length and @xmath4 is a tunable parameter .",
    "when @xmath5 , eq.([efficient ] ) can reach a very high network capacity , which is almost ten times larger than shortest paths . actually , the efficient routing strategy propels the packets to use the low - degree nodes , which composes the peripheral of the network .",
    "therefore , the capacity of low - degree nodes can be utilized and so the system s capacity can be improved .",
    "the nodes ability can not be fully reflected by the degree . the best routing strategy to fully utilize the nodes ability",
    "might be accomplished by examine the queue length of nodes . recently , ling etal proposed a global dynamic routing strategy @xcite , in which the path between any pair of nodes is defined as the sum of nodes queue length is minimum : @xmath6;\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the queue length of node @xmath8 .",
    "this routing strategy selects the path along which the nodes have least traffic loads .",
    "thus the network capacity can be further enhanced to almost double of the efficient routing strategy . as far as we know , the global dynamic routing strategy can achieve the highest performance for scale - free networks .",
    "nevertheless , the shortcoming of this routing protocol lies in its high computational consumption since the paths are dynamical .",
    "this problem can be acute when the network size is large . an approach to reach the performance of global dynamic routing strategy with static paths",
    "is needed .    in this brief report",
    ", we propose that by the help of  pheromone \" , this kind of static routing paths can be obtained .",
    "the concept of  pheromone \" has been proved to be efficient to form a good local routing strategy @xcite .",
    "here it is demonstrated that  pheromone \" can also help to generate routing paths that can reach high traffic capacities as the global dynamic routing strategy for scale - free , small - world and random network infrastructures .",
    "in the process of moving , ants will release a special kind of secretion pheromone , which helps other ants to look for paths @xcite .",
    "the pheromone released by the pioneer packets are important for the final paths to be established .",
    "similarly , we suppose that some pioneer packets travel in the network by the global dynamic paths and drop an information of  pheromone \" to the nodes in the first period .",
    "therefore , the traffic flow characters of global dynamic routing strategy can be reserved",
    ". then the static routing paths are generated by the  pheromone \" information .",
    "finally , the packets are forwarded with the output routing paths .",
    "the paths are static and the packets do not need to drop  pheromone \" any more .",
    "the traffic model is described as follows .",
    "initially , the pheromone density of each node is set to zero . the maximal queue length of each node is assumed to be unlimited and first - in - fist - out ( fifo ) discipline is applied .",
    "the nodes delivering ability is set to @xmath9 , i.e. , each node can forward only one packet to its neighboring nodes in each step .",
    "\\(1 ) test stage : in this stage with preset length of @xmath10 steps , @xmath11 test packets are forwarded in the system by the global dynamic routing strategy @xcite .",
    "the routing paths are update in every step .",
    "meanwhile , each test packet waiting in the queue will release one unit of pheromone to the current node for each step .",
    "that is , if a test packet waits for @xmath12 steps in the queue before being delivered , the pheromone density of this node will increase by @xmath12 units .",
    "the unit pheromone value is set to @xmath13 .",
    "when a test packet arrives at its destination , it remains in the system and is forwarded to another random destination .",
    "after @xmath10 steps , the nodes in the system will have different pheromone densities and the test packets are all removed .",
    "\\(2 ) path generation stage : the pheromone static path for any pair of nodes is generated that the sum pheromone density of nodes along the path is minimum : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pheromone density of node @xmath8 .",
    "\\(3 ) delivery stage : in each step , @xmath16 packets enter the system with randomly chosen sources and destinations .",
    "the packets are forwarded by the pheromone static paths .",
    "the paths do not need to be updated .",
    "once a packet arrives at its destination , it is removed from the system . following common practice ,",
    "we adopt the order parameter @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the number of packets within the network at time @xmath20 , and @xmath21 indicates the average over time windows of width @xmath22 .",
    "with increasing packet generation rate @xmath16 , there will be a critical value of @xmath23 which characterizes the phase transition from free flow ( @xmath24 ) to congestion ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in the free flow state , @xmath26 is around zero due to the balance of created and removed packets .",
    "when @xmath16 exceeds @xmath23 , the packets accumulate in the network , and @xmath26 becomes positive .",
    "the network s overall capacity can be measured by the maximal generating rate @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath23 can also be estimated analytically by the maximal node betweenness in the network @xcite : @xmath27 where betweenness ( @xmath28 ) is defined as the number of paths passing through a node , and @xmath29 is the network size .",

    "each data point is obtained by carry out the model on one ba network realization with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath36.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we note that this model is different from the ant colony algorithm @xcite because it does not consider the evaporation effect of pheromone and the pheromone only appears in the first two stages .",
    "actually , the concept of pheromone is borrowed only to record the traffic flow trace of global dynamic routing strategy . from the above model",
    ", one can also see that the model can be adjusted by changing the parameters of testing time length @xmath10 and test packet number @xmath11 . in the following",
    ", we will show the results on three typical network structures : the barabsi - albert ( ba ) scale - free networks @xcite , the newman - watts small - world networks @xcite and the erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs @xcite .",
    "we firstly present the simulation and analytical results on ba scale - free networks @xcite . in this model , starting from @xmath37 fully connected nodes , a new node with @xmath2 links is added to the existing graph at each step according to the preferential attachment . the probability for the new node to be connected to an existing node",
    "@xmath38 is proportional to the degree @xmath39 of the node .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a typical distribution of pheromone as function of node degree at the end of test stage .",
    "it approximately follows a piecewise power law with positive exponent .",

    "one can see that the analytical results are slightly larger than simulation results .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the noise in the simulation .    in fig.[fig3](a )",

    "when @xmath57 , the system enters congestion for efficient routing strategy , thus the packet s travelling time increases rapidly . when @xmath58 , the system is also congested with pheromone static paths , thus the average travelling time also increases .",
