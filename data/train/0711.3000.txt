    "stochastic processes are the standard tools provided by probability theory to represent systems subjected to random evolution . in spite of the fact that quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory ,",
    "the presence of quantum interference prevents the standard formalism of quantum mechanics to represent a quantum system as a stochastic process .    in order to understand this ,",
    "let us consider the most general version of a stochastic process , namely the canonical stochastic process .",
    "let @xmath4 be the configuration space of a system of particles ( for example @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 its borel @xmath7-algebra .",
    "moreover , let @xmath5 be a suitable time interval including the origin , and let @xmath11 denote the set of all the trajectories @xmath12 .",
    "given @xmath13 and @xmath14 , let @xmath15 denote the set @xmath16 .",
    "the sets of this kind will be referred to as _ s - sets _ ( an abbreviated name for single - time cylinder - sets ) ; let @xmath17 denote the class of the s - sets .",
    "a _ canonical stochastic process _ is the triple @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-algebra generated by the s - sets ( or equivalently , by the cylinder sets ) and @xmath19 is a probability measure on @xmath6 . according to the kolmogorov reconstruction theorem ,",
    "the probability @xmath19 is univocally determined by its _ finite dimensional distributions _ ,",
    "i.e. by its values at the finite intersections of s - sets : @xmath20.\\ ] ] since @xmath19 is a probability measure , this expression is additive , i.e. , if @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 = p [ \\ldots \\cap ( t_i , \\delta_i)\\cap \\ldots ] + p [ \\ldots \\cap ( t_i , \\delta'_i ) \\cap \\ldots ] .\\ ] ] the physical interpretation of a canonical stochastic process is simple : the evolution of the system of particles during the time interval @xmath5 is represented by a trajectory chosen at random from @xmath11 .",
    "let us now attempt to represent a system of quantum particles as a canonical stochastic process . in the quantum case",
    "as well , we can take @xmath4 as the configuration space and , for the time being , let us assume that also in the quantum case the particles follow a trajectory of @xmath11 .",
    "the problem is then to define the probability @xmath19 , i.e. to find a quantum expression for the finite dimensional distributions ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "we know that a normalized wave function @xmath23 is associated with the quantum system , where @xmath24 is the unitary time evolution operator and @xmath25 is the wave function of the system at the time @xmath26 . according to the born rule , the probability of finding the particles in the region @xmath13 at the time @xmath27 is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the projection valued measure on @xmath10 . in other words , we can say that @xmath28 is the probability that a trajectory chosen at random from @xmath11 belong to the s - set @xmath15 .",
    "thus for @xmath30 we have a valid quantum expression for ( [ r1 ] ) , namely @xmath31=||e(\\delta)\\psi(t)||^2.\\ ] ] the problems arise when @xmath32 . a tentative quantum expression for ( [ r1 ] )",
    "could be @xmath33 . according to the born rule and to the reduction postulate ,",
    "( [ r2 ] ) is the probability of finding the particles in the regions @xmath34 at the times @xmath35 , for @xmath36 .",
    "however ( [ r2 ] ) is not an admissible expression for the finite dimensional distributions , because it is not additive , i.e. if @xmath37 , in general we have @xmath38 the non additivity of ( [ r2 ] ) corresponds to the well known interference phenomena of quantum mechanics .",
    "another possible expression , namely : @xmath39 is also not admissible , because , although it is additive , it is non - positive definite .",
    "we must therefore conclude that a valid expression for the finite dimensional distributions , and therefore a probability measure for @xmath11 , can not be extracted from the standard quantum formalism .",
    "two possible solutions to this problem can be proposed , corresponding to different formulations / interpretations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the first is to simply remove the set @xmath11 , and to let the wave function be the only mathematical entity representing a quantum system .",
    "this is , for example , the position of the copenhagen and of the many worlds interpretations @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite heisenberg explicitly connects the quantum interference phenomena and the necessity to renounce a description of the motion of the particles in terms of trajectories .",
    "the second solution is to add a new element to the standard quantum formalism which allows us to define the required probability measure .",
    "this is the case , for example , of nelson s stochastic mechanics @xcite , which introduces a stochastic differential equation , and of bohmian mechanics @xcite , which introduces the guidance equation . for various reasons that we do not discuss here , for many physicists none of these formulations is satisfying .    in this paper",
    "a third solution is proposed , which maintains the set @xmath11 and does not add new elements to the quantum formalism , but rather admits the possibility that the quantum formalism defines a _ set of probability measures _ on @xmath11 instead of a single probability .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 is the set of all the probability measures on @xmath3 , the born rule defines the set of probabilities @xmath41=||e(\\delta)\\psi(t)||^2 \\ ; \\ ; \\hbox{for all } \\ ; \\ ; ( t , \\delta ) \\in { \\cal s}\\}.\\ ] ] this paper therefore proposes that , instead of a `` precise '' stochastic process @xmath18 , the correct mathematical model of a quantum system is an `` imprecise '' stochastic process @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is a suitable set of probability measures . the word `` imprecise '' has been used intentionally , because _ imprecise probability _ is a generic term which also includes the theory of sets of probabilities @xcite .",
    "the meaning of this representation is that a possible evolution of the system is represented by a trajectory chosen at random from @xmath11 _ according to any one of the probabilities of @xmath42_. in general , in an imprecise stochastic process there are events without a well defined probability , and therefore the predictive power of the process is limited to those events @xmath43 for which @xmath44 has , at least approximately , the same value for all the probabilities @xmath45 .",
    "a fundamental element of the proposed solution is the use of the quantum typicality rule instead of the born rule to define the set @xmath2 .",
    "let us explain this .",
    "the set @xmath46 defined by the born rule arguably explains the results of the statistical experiments , because it attributes a well defined probability to any set of configurations at a given time .",
    "however , the born rule does not establish any correlation between the positions of the particles at different times , and therefore it can not define a dynamical structure for the trajectories .",
    "therefore , if the imprecise process @xmath47 is used to represent a macroscopic system , for example the universe , it can not explain the quasi - classical structure of the macroscopic evolution .",
    "this is also a well known problem in connection with the copenhagen and the many words interpretations .    in a recent paper we proposed a new quantum rule , the _ quantum typicality rule _ , according to which , roughly speaking , the particles follow the branches of the wave function @xcite . in the present paper a set @xmath2 of probabilities corresponding to the quantum typicality rule",
    "is defined , and some of its properties are studied .",
    "this set is contained in @xmath46 , i.e. the quantum typicality rule implies the born rule .",
    "moreover , since the quantum typicality rule establishes a correlation between the positions of the particles at two different times , the set @xmath2 arguably explains the macroscopic quasi - classical structure of the trajectories .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ quantum ] the quantum typicality rule is reviewed . in section",
    "[ theory ] a short review of the theory of imprecise probability is given . in section",
    "[ born ] a formal definition of the born rule in terms of imprecise probability is given . in section [ thequantum ] a formal definition of the quantum typicality rule in terms of imprecise probability is given , and the _ quantum process _ , i.e. the proposed mathematical model of a quantum system , is defined . in section [ two ]",
    "two properties of quantum processes are studied .",
    "section [ discussion ] presents a concluding discussion about the formulation of quantum mechanics based on the quantum typicality rule .",
    "let us first introduce the notion of typicality in a probability space .",
    "let @xmath48 be a probability space , and let @xmath43 and @xmath49 be two measurable subsets of @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "the set @xmath43 is said to be _ typical _ relative to @xmath49 if @xmath52 where @xmath53 is understood to mean @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath43 is typical relative to @xmath49 , then the overwhelming majority of the elements of @xmath49 also belongs to @xmath43 . from the empirical point of view",
    ", the consequence of the typicality of @xmath43 is that a single element chosen at random from @xmath49 will also belong to @xmath43 .",
    "two sets @xmath43 and @xmath49 are said to be _ mutually typical _ if @xmath43 is typical relative to @xmath49 and vice - versa .",
    "mutual typicality can be expressed by the condition @xmath56    the notion of typicality is used in bohmian mechanics in order to prove the _ quantum equilibrium hypothesis _ @xcite and it is also ( implicitly ) the basis for boltzmann s derivation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce the quantum typicality rule . in its simplest and most intuitive form ,",
    "the quantum typicality rule states : suppose that the wave function of a particle is the sum of two non - overlapping wave packets",
    ". then , during the time over which the wave packets are non - overlapping , the particle stays inside the support of one of the two wave packets , without jumping to the other one .",
    "for example , let us consider the following simple experiment :     + fig.1    the source @xmath57 emits photons towards a beam splitter , the reflected ( transmitted ) photons are detected by the detector @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two slits .",
    "the quantum typicality rule states that the photons detected , for example , by the detector @xmath59 , cross the slit @xmath60 .",
    "even if this assumption is very reasonable , it can not be deduced from standard quantum mechanics , which does not predict the trajectory of a quantum system between the preparation and the measurement times .",
    "this feature of quantum mechanics is essentially the origin of its difficulty in explaining the emergence of a quasi - classical world .",
    "we can easily express the rule in a mathematical form .",
    "let @xmath23 be the wave function of a particle ( or of a system of particles ) .",
    "let us suppose that at a time @xmath62 the wave function can be expressed as the sum of two non - overlapping wave packets @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and that at a time @xmath65 the two wave packets are still non - overlapping , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 are non - overlapping .",
    "this implies that two subsets @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the configuration space of the particle exist , such that @xmath70 due to the unavoidable spreading of the wave function , the wave packets can be only approximately non - overlapping .",
    "this is the reason for using the approximate equality symbol in ( [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "the sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be considered as the supports of @xmath63 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) can be combined to give the condition @xmath71 this reasoning can also be reversed : given two subsets @xmath68 and @xmath69 satisfying condition ( [ cc2 ] ) , the wave packet @xmath72 satisfies the conditions of ( [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "the quantum typicality rule states that , if the particle is in @xmath69 at the time @xmath73 and condition ( [ cc2 ] ) holds , then the particle was in @xmath68 at the time @xmath62 .",
    "since the two times are symmetric , it is natural to assume also the reverse conclusion : if the particle is in @xmath68 at the time @xmath62 then it will be in @xmath69 at the time @xmath73 .",
    "let us take a further step and assume , as proposed in the introduction , that a quantum particle follows a trajectory belonging to @xmath11 .",
    "note that this assumption is implicitly contained in the intuitive formulation of the quantum typicality rule , because such a rule assumes that the particle has a position at a suitable time even if no measurement is performed at that time .",
    "then the quantum typicality rule can be expressed by stating that condition ( [ cc2 ] ) implies that the two s - sets @xmath74 and @xmath75 are mutually typical .",
    "a more compact notation can also be introduced .",
    "if @xmath57 denotes the s - set @xmath15 , let @xmath76 denote the state @xmath77 . with this notation , condition ( [ cc2 ] )",
    "assumes the form @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the norm has been squared for reasons that will become clear in section [ thequantum ] . due to the presence of the approximate equality , condition ( [ cc3 ] ) must be normalized . in order to simplify the normalization",
    ", we impose the further natural condition that @xmath80 . in conclusion",
    ", the quantum typicality can be expressed as follows :    if @xmath81 and @xmath82 are two s - sets such that @xmath80 and @xmath83 than @xmath81 and @xmath82 are mutually typical .",
    "the constraint @xmath80 , which was not present in the first formulation of the rule @xcite , will be discussed in section [ thequantum ] .",
    "the problem is now to correlate the definition of mutual typicality given by the probabilistic expression ( [ 3 ] ) with the one given by the quantum expression ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this correlation is conceptually similar to the correlation @xmath84 given by the born rule , and it will be realized by means of the theory of imprecise probability .",
    "a very short review is given here of the theory of sets of probabilities , which is a part of the theory of imprecise probability @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a measurable space and @xmath40 be the set of all the probability measures on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary non - empty subset of @xmath40 .",
    "upper _ and the _ lower probability _ induced by @xmath1 are the two set functions @xmath85 defined by : @xmath86 we can easily see that @xmath87 and @xmath88 satisfy the following properties : @xmath89 equation ( [ p3 ] ) states that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are conjugate ; equations ( [ p4 ] ) and ( [ p5 ] ) state that @xmath87 is superadditive and @xmath88 is subadditive ; equation ( [ p6 ] ) states that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are monotone .",
    "the triple @xmath90 will be referred to as an _ imprecise probability space_. in the case in which @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the more specific term _ imprecise stochastic process _ will be used .",
    "the predictive power of an imprecise probability space is limited to those events @xmath43 for which @xmath44 assumes approximately the same value for all @xmath93 .",
    "such a condition is satisfied for example if a positive number @xmath94 exists such that @xmath95    let us now study how sets of probability measures can be defined .",
    "let @xmath96 be an arbitrary subset of @xmath97 , and @xmath98 a non negative set function .",
    "let us define a set of probability measures @xmath1 as @xmath99 alternatively , the set @xmath1 can be defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "we now have the following lemma @xcite : the set @xmath1 defined by ( [ t ] ) is not empty iff , for any pair of finite sequences @xmath103 and @xmath104 of non negative numbers and of sets of @xmath96 , the condition @xmath105 implies the condition @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath108 ( see note . ] ) .",
    "let us first apply the theory of imprecise probability to the born rule . as mentioned in the introduction , the born rule defines the set of probabilities on @xmath3 satisfying the condition @xmath109 for any s - set @xmath57 .    by referring to the notation used in the previous section",
    ", we have the condition that @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus the set @xmath46 defined by the born rule is @xmath113 note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , which implies that @xmath109 for all @xmath117 and for all @xmath118 , as required .",
    "the class @xmath46 is not empty because it contains at least the probability @xmath19 defined by the finite dimensional distributions @xmath119 where the assumption is made that @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "the imprecise process @xmath122 will be referred to as the _ born process_.",
    "let us now attempt to define a set of probabilities @xmath2 corresponding to the quantum typicality rule .",
    "the most natural definition appears to be the following : the set @xmath96 is @xmath123 and the set function @xmath124 is @xmath125 the s - sets have been excluded from @xmath96 because @xmath124 is not a well defined set function for @xmath126 . the set @xmath2 is then defined as @xmath127    let us introduce the conjugate elements @xmath128 and @xmath129 : @xmath130",
    "@xmath131 we can easily see that @xmath132 since @xmath133 we obtain the condition @xmath109 for all @xmath117 and for all @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath134 , i.e. the formal quantum typicality rule implies the born rule . for this reason",
    "the condition @xmath135 is also satisfied for @xmath126 . indeed in this case",
    "we have @xmath136    the imprecise process @xmath8 will be referred to as a _ quantum process _ , and the defining condition ( [ ww ] ) will be referred to as the _ formal _ quantum typicality rule .",
    "the adjective `` formal '' has been adjoined in order to distinguish condition ( [ ww ] ) from the quantum typicality rule as expressed in section [ quantum ] , which will be referred to as the _ physical _ quantum typicality rule .",
    "these adjectives will , however , be omitted when not required for reasons of clarity .",
    "the physical quantum typicality rule can be derived trivially from the formal rule .",
    "thus , if @xmath81 and @xmath82 be two s - sets such that @xmath80 and @xmath137 than @xmath138 for all @xmath45 .",
    "the definition of the formal quantum typicality rule given by ( [ ww ] ) appears to be the simplest and most natural one , corresponding to the physical quantum typicality rule .",
    "however , some variants of this definition are possible , which we will now examine .",
    "let us first discuss the constraint @xmath139 ) must be replaced by the condition @xmath140 if @xmath141 is the corresponding set of probabilities , we have @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the constraint ( [ co ] ) actually gives rise to a more general set of probabilities .",
    "this fact , together with the fact that this simplifies both the formal and the physical formulations of the quantum typicality rule , suggests that the constraint ( [ co ] ) is appropriate .    here",
    "it should be noted that the formal and the physical formulations are not totally equivalent , because the latter acts only in the typicality regime , i.e. when @xmath143    on the contrary , condition ( [ ww ] ) also imposes a constraint on the probability when ( [ ry ] ) does not hold true . in order to eliminate such a difference , condition ( [ ww ] )",
    "can be replaced by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a suitable `` small '' positive number . if @xmath146 is the set of probabilities defined by this condition , then @xmath147 .",
    "the problem with this definition is its vagueness , because a precise value for @xmath145 can not be provided .",
    "note also that also a condition of the type @xmath148 where @xmath149 is positive number not `` too small '' and not `` too big '' , could be consistent with the physical quantum typicality rule .",
    "also this definition is vague .",
    "there are conceptual reasons which suggest that the definition of the set @xmath2 is necessarily vague , in the sense that slightly different definitions of @xmath2 are empirically indistinguishable .",
    "these reasons are connected with the fact that we have access to the past structure of the trajectories only through the memories of the past which are encoded in the present configuration of our recording devices .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of this point .",
    "this subject will be further developed in a future paper .",
    "unfortunately we can not make any statement about the consistency of the quantum typicality rule , i.e. we can not prove that the set @xmath2 is not empty .",
    "the problem of the consistency of the quantum typicality rule was also discussed in @xcite , where some inequalities making such a consistency plausible were proposed . here",
    "the problem has not yet been solved in a rigorous way , but at least it has been formulated in a precise way .",
    "let us study two properties of quantum processes .",
    "in general , the probability of the intersection of two non equal time s - sets @xmath81 and @xmath82 is not well defined by @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath150 may have different values for different @xmath45 .",
    "for example , let the wave function @xmath151 be a single wave packet , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that @xmath152 . if @xmath153 is large enough , we have in any case ( that is also in the case in which @xmath154 ) that @xmath155 , and therefore there is no constraint preventing @xmath156 $ ] from assuming a wide range of values .",
    "there is however a typical situation in which @xmath150 has ( approximately ) the same value for all @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath157 be a wave packet which does not overlap @xmath158 at the times @xmath62 and @xmath73 and let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the supports of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively , with @xmath161 . according to the quantum typicality rule , @xmath162 and @xmath79 are mutually typical .",
    "thus , if @xmath163 is another s - set such that @xmath164 and @xmath165 is not `` too small '' relative to @xmath166 , we expect that @xmath167 .",
    "this result can be proven rigorously .",
    "in fact , for all @xmath45 , we have the inequality : latexmath:[\\[\\label{ii }    for @xmath80 and @xmath169 .",
    "thus , if @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath170 are defined as above , we have @xmath171 and therefore @xmath172    let us prove inequality ( [ ii ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath173 moreover @xmath174    let us now refer to another property .",
    "in @xcite and in section [ int ] we mentioned that the trajectories follow approximately the branches of the wave function",
    ". we can now give a precise mathematical formulation of this assertion .",
    "let us consider again the wave packets @xmath175 and @xmath176 defined above , and let us suppose that they do not overlap during the entire time interval @xmath177 $ ] .",

    "moreover , for any @xmath45 , let @xmath187 be the probability space obtained from @xmath18 by restricting @xmath11 to @xmath81 . on this space",

    "indeed we have @xmath194 as to the second inequality ( [ w11 ] ) , let @xmath94 be a given point of the interval @xmath195 $ ] and @xmath196 a given value ( of probability ) .",
    "we have @xmath197 indeed the supremum of the expectation value is obtained when the probability density @xmath198 of @xmath192 is shifted as much as possible on the right of the interval @xmath195 $ ] compatibly with the constraint @xmath199 , that is when it is of the form @xmath200 .",
    "the second inequality ( [ w11 ] ) is obtained by posing the condition @xmath201 and by replacing @xmath94 with @xmath202 .",
    "conditions ( [ w11 ] ) hold true for any sequence of times . by choosing a `` dense '' sequence ,",
    "the value of @xmath203 can be assumed to correspond to the fraction of the time interval @xmath177 $ ] that the trajectory @xmath204 spends inside @xmath179 .",
    "thus , if for example @xmath205 , from the second inequality ( [ w11 ] ) we obtain @xmath206 in other words , the overwhelming majority of the trajectories of @xmath81 spend the greatest part of the time interval @xmath177 $ ] inside the support @xmath179 .",
    "this is the mathematical formulation of the assertion that the trajectories follow approximately the branches of the wave function .",
    "let us summarize the formulation of quantum mechanics as a theory of imprecise probability .    according to this formulation",
    ", a closed system of quantum particles is represented as a quantum process @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the configuration space of the particles , @xmath5 is a time interval , @xmath6 is the @xmath7-algebra generated by the s - sets ( or equivalently , by the cylinder sets ) and @xmath2 is the set of probability measures on @xmath11 defined by the formal quantum typicality rule : @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the meaning of this interpretation is that the trajectory followed by the quantum particles corresponds to a trajectory chosen at random ( according to any one of the probabilities of @xmath2 ) from the set @xmath11 .",
    "the predictive power of this model is limited to those events @xmath43 for which @xmath44 has approximately the same value for all @xmath45 .",

    "as we will now discuss , this appears to be sufficient to explain the results of the statistical experiments and the quasi - classical structure of the macroscopic evolution .",
    "since the only system which is really closed is the universe , the basic assumption is that the entire universe is represented as a quantum process .",
    "the fact that subsystems of the universe can also be represented as quantum processes would have to be deduced from the basic assumption by means of reasoning analogous to that adopted in @xcite .",
    "here , we do not make this reasoning explicit .",
    "since there is just one universe , just one trajectory is chosen from @xmath11 , and its properties derive from reasoning based on typicality rather than on probability : suppose that @xmath210 is the set of the trajectories satisfying a suitable property , and that @xmath211 for all @xmath45 .",
    "this explains why a single trajectory chosen at random from @xmath11 satisfies the property @xcite .",
    "for example , we have seen in section [ two ] that the overwhelming majority of the trajectories of @xmath11 follows approximately the branches of the universal wave function .",
    "this formulation of quantum mechanics is a _ trajectory based formulation _ , analogous for example to bohmian mechanics or to nelson s stochastic mechanics . in these formulations",
    "the particles follow definite trajectories , their positions are the only observable quantities and neither the measurement process nor the observers enter into the theory on a fundamental level . the standard quantum measurement theory can be derived in this context on the basis of the fact that any measurement performed in a real laboratory ultimately comes down to a measurement of the position of a pointer @xcite .",
    "a quantum process arguably explains both the results of the statistical experiments and the quasi - classical structure of macroscopic evolution .",
    "the former explanation derives from the fact that all the probabilities of @xmath2 satisfy the born rule .",
    "the latter explanation derives from the assumption that the universal wave function has a branching structure , i.e. that it can be split at any time into permanently non - overlapping wave packets , and that the supports of the wave packets have a limited extension , i.e. an extension compatible with a well defined macroscopic configuration .",
    "when , during the time evolution , the support of a wave packet extends over a region no longer compatible with a well defined macroscopic configuration , it is assumed that it can be further split into smaller wave packets with the required extension .",
    "moreover , the macroscopic configurations corresponding to the supports of the branches ( or at least , to the overwhelming majority of them ) are assumed to evolve quasi - classically .",
    "the branching structure of the universal wave function is accepted by various authors @xcite .",
    "the quasi - classical evolution of the branches would have to be derived from the ehrenfest theorem and/or from reasoning analogous to mott s analysis of the bubble chamber experiment @xcite .",
    "of course , all these assumptions require a more rigorous investigation . note that , in this formulation of quantum mechanics , the nature of the branching process is well defined , namely a branch is a _ spatially _ non - overlapping wave packet .",
    "this is not the case , for example , in the many worlds interpretation , in which the preferred - basis problem appears to be still open .",
    "given the branching structure for the universal wave function described above , the quasi - classical structure of the trajectory of our universe then derives from the fact that the overwhelming majority of the trajectories follow approximately the branches of the wave function , as shown in section [ two ] .    a last remark regarding the role played by the set @xmath11 in a quantum process : usually , in quantum mechanics position variables are considered `` hidden variables '' .",
    "in this case , however , @xmath11 is the sample space of an ( imprecise ) probability space , and therefore such a definition appears to be inappropriate .",
    "the set @xmath11 has no empirical content , i.e. no empirical prediction can be derived from it . on the contrary ,",
    "all the predictions can be derived from the set @xmath2 alone , that is from the wave function .",
    "however @xmath11 can not be removed from a quantum process , for the same reason for which the sample space can not be removed from a probability space . in other words , without the set @xmath11 we can calculate everything , but we have serious coherence problems .",
    "this situation appears to reflect the current situation of quantum mechanics .",
