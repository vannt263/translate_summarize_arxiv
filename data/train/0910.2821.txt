    "observations were carried out using the large apex bolometer camera laboca @xcite on the apex telescope @xcite at llano de chajnantor in chile .",
    "laboca is an array of 295 composite bolometers with neutron - transmutation - doped ( ntd ) germanium thermistors .",
    "the bolometers are ac - biased and operated in total power mode .",
    "real - time signal processing of the 1khz data stream includes digital anti - alias filtering and down - sampling to 25hz .",
    "the radiation is coupled onto the detectors through an array of conical feed horns whose layout leads to a double beam spaced distribution of the individual beams in a hexagonal configuration over the @xmath32 field of view .",
    "the center wavelength of laboca is 870(345ghz ) and its passband has a fwhm of @xmath33 ( 60ghz ) .",
    "the measured angular resolution of each beam is @xmath34 fwhm .",
    "the observations were carried out between may 2007 and november 2008 in mostly excellent weather conditions with an average precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) of 0.5 mm corresponding to a zenith opacity of 0.2 at the observing wavelength .",
    "the mapping pattern was chosen to give a uniform coverage across a @xmath0 area centered at ra @xmath35 dec @xmath36 .",
    "mapping was performed by alternating rectangular , horizontal on - the - fly ( otf ) scans with a raster of spirals pattern .",
    "otf maps were done with a scanning velocity of 2arcmins@xmath29 and a spacing orthogonal to the scanning direction of @xmath37 . for the spiral mode ,",
    "the telescope traces in two scans spirals with radii between @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 16 and 9 positions ( the raster ) spaced by 10@xmath15 in azimuth and elevation ( see fig.9 in @xcite for a plot of this scanning pattern ) .",
    "the radii and spacings of the spirals were optimized for uniform noise coverage across the @xmath0 region , while keeping telescope overheads at a minimum .",
    "the scanning speed varies between 2  3arcmins@xmath29 , modulating the source signals into the useful post - detection frequency band ( 0.1 to 12.5 hz ) of laboca , while providing at least 3 measurements per beam at the data rate of 25 samples per second even at the highest scanning velocity .",
    "absolute flux calibration was achieved through observations of mars , uranus and neptune as well as secondary calibrators ( v883ori , ngc2071 and vycma ) and was found to be accurate within 8.5% ( rms ) .",
    "the atmospheric attenuation was determined via skydips every @xmath40 2 hours as well as from independent data from the apex radiometer which measures the line of sight water vapor column every minute ( see * ? ? ? * for a more detailed description ) .",
    "focus settings were typically determined a few times per night and checked during sunrise depending on the availability of suitable sources .",
    "pointing was checked on the nearby quasars pmnj0457 - 2324 , pmnj0106 - 4034 and pmnj0403 - 3605 and found to be stable within @xmath41 ( rms ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the bolometer array data analysis software ( boa , schuller  in prep . ) .",
    "reduction steps on the time series ( time ordered data of each bolometer ) include temperature drift correction based on two `` blind '' bolometers ( whose horns have been sealed to block the sky signal ) , flat fielding , calibration , opacity correction , flagging of unsuitable data ( bad bolometers and/or data taken outside reasonable telescope scanning velocity and acceleration limits ) as well as de - spiking .",
    "the correlated noise removal was performed using the median signal of all bolometers in the array as well as on groups of bolometers related by the wiring and in the electronics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "after the de - correlation , frequencies below 0.5hz were filtered using a noise whitening algorithm .",
    "dead or noisy bolometers were identified based on the noise level of the reduced time series for each detector .",
    "the number of useful bolometers is typically @xmath42 .",
    "the data quality of each scan was evaluated using the mean rms of all useful detectors before correcting for the atmospheric attenuation ( which effectively measures the instrumental noise equivalent flux density , nefd ) and based on the number of spikes ( measuring interferences ) . after omitting bad data",
    "we are left with an on - source integration time of @xmath43hrs . each good scan",
    "was then gridded into a spatial intensity and weighting map with a pixel size of @xmath44 .",
    "this pixel size ( @xmath401/3 of the beam size ) well oversamples the beam and therefore accurately preserves the spatial information in the map .",
    "weights are calculated based on the rms of each time series contributing to a certain grid point in the map .",
    "individual maps were coadded noise - weighted .",
    "the resulting map was used in a second iteration of the reduction to flag those parts of the time streams with sources of a signal to noise ratio @xmath45 .",
    "this cut off is defined by our source extraction algorithm .",
    "the reduction with the significant sources flagged guarantees that the source fluxes are not affected by filtering and baseline subtraction and essentially corresponds to the very same reduction steps that have been performed on the calibrators .    to remove remaining low frequency noise artefacts we convolved the final coadded map with a @xmath46 gaussian kernel and subtracted the resulting large scale structures from the unsmoothed map .",
    "the convolution kernel has been adjusted to match the low frequency excess in the map .",
    "this step is effectively equivalent to the low frequency behavior of an optimal point - source ( wiener ) filtering operation @xcite .",
    "the effective decrease of the source fluxes ( @xmath47 ) for this well defined operation has been taken into account by scaling the fluxes accordingly .",
    "finally the map was beam smoothed ( convolved by the beam size of @xmath48 ) to optimally filter the high frequencies for point sources .",
    "this step reduces the spatial resolution to @xmath49 .",
    "the signal and signal to noise ( s / n ) presentations of our final data product is shown in fig.[cdfs - flux ] .    to ensure that aboves reduction steps do not affect the flux calibration of our map we performed the same reduction steps on simulated time streams with known source fluxes and artificial correlated and gaussian noise .",
    "these tests veri-        fied that our calibration scheme is accurate to @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore we reduced data of pss2322 + 1944 , a @xmath51 qso which has been observed during the science verification of laboca , in the same way as the ecdfs data . from this measurement",
    "we find @xmath52mjy in good agreement with the scuba measurements ( @xmath53mjy , * ? ? ?",
    ".,width=226 ]    finally we determined the point spread function ( psf ) in our map by applying the same data reduction steps to pmnj0403 - 3605 , the most frequently used pointing source near the ecdfs . the beam profile ( before beam smoothing )",
    "is shown in fig.[beam ] and is well described by a gaussian with fwhm of @xmath48 .",
    "the faint negative structure at radii between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is due to the combined effect of the correlated noise removal , the low - frequency filtering on the time series and the spatial large scale filtering .",
    "to investigate the noise properties of our laboca map we have created 100 pure noise realizations of the data by randomly inverting half of the maps of individual scans during the coadding ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all image processing steps match the real map including the large scale filtering .",
    "these so  called ",
    "jackknife maps  are therefore free of any astronomical signal and at the same time represent the noise structure of the data .",
    "we first investigate how the noise in our map integrates down with time .",
    "this is shown in fig.[cdfs - down ] where we plot the rms noise level measured on the central @xmath56 of our map as a function of the integration time per beam .",
    "we have generated down - integration curves for the pure noise realizations , the unmodified data and for the data after subtracting the full source catalog ( see sect.[cata ] ) from each scan .",
    "all three computations were done at the original spatial resolution as well as for the beam - smoothed data .",
    "ten computations with randomized scan order were performed for each method .",
    "fig.[cdfs - down ] shows the average of these computations .",
    "as expected , the pure noise realizations integrate down proportionally to @xmath57 independent of the spatial resolution . at the original spatial resolution of @xmath48",
    "the influence of the source signals is small and even the down - integrating of the data including all sources follows this behavior very closely .",
    "some excess noise is barely visible after several hundred seconds of integration time per beam .",
    "the noise excess becomes very pronounced for the beam smoothed data and it remains visible even after the subtraction of the source catalog from the data .",
    "in fact , much of the noise access ( 65% ) remains in our beam - smoothed down - integrating curves after source subtraction .",
    "this shows that the noise in our map is limited by sources fainter than our catalog limit ( @xmath58mjy , sect.[cata ] ) or in other words that our map starts to be confusion limited .",
    "we have estimated the confusion noise arising from these faint sources by fitting the down integration curve for the beam smoothed data using @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the observed , instrumental / atmospheric and confusion noise terms respectively . from this fit",
    "we derive a confusion noise of @xmath63 at @xmath64 resolution .",
    "we note that this level of confusion noise is consistent with the simulated down - integration curves based on our source counts ( see sect.[pd - analysis ] ) .",
    "( see sect.[sect - noise]).,width=245 ]    given that our map rms is affected by confusion noise , the question arises which noise level is appropriate for computing the noise distribution across the field and the corresponding signal - to - noise ( s / n ) map , which is used for source extraction .",
    "usually , the weights of the data ( reflecting the rms weighted integration time in each pixel ) are used to derive the noise distribution .",
    "this approach , however , is equivalent to using the jackknife noise , neglects the confusion noise and therefore overestimates the s / n ratio .",
    "we here use the noise based on the weights with a scaling to take the confusion noise into account .",
    "the scaling was determined from the flux and s",
    "/ n histograms in the ecdfs . the basic principle is shown in fig .",
    "[ cdfs - histo ] ( top ) where we compare the average beam smoothed flux pixel histograms of the jackknifes to a histogram of the real map .",
    "the figure shows that the negative part of the observed histogram is significantly broader than the jackknife histogram .",
    "this is because inserting sources in a pure noise map ( e.g. the jackknife ) will not only result in the positive flux tail , but also shift the entire flux histogram to positive values and broaden the gaussian part of the distribution ( because it is no longer centered around zero and sources also fall on the formally negative part of the flux distribution ) . as the zero point ( true total power information ) is undetermined in our reduction ( e.g. via baseline subtraction )",
    ", the observed flux histogram is roughly centered at zero and only the broadening remains an observable compared to the jackknife .",
    "this broadening can be used to take the confusion noise into account . in practice , we have scaled the rms map derived from the weights such that the negative part of the gaussian signal - to - noise histogram ( fig.[cdfs - histo ] bottom ) has a @xmath3 of unity .    the resulting spatial distribution of the beam - smoothed noise level across the imaged field is shown in fig.[rms - sources ] .",
    "the deepest part of our map has a noise level of 1.10 mjy@xmath65 , the typical rms at the edges of the @xmath56 field is 1.25 mjy@xmath66 .",
    "the average noise level across the field is 1.17 mjy@xmath66 with a dispersion of 40 @xmath14jy@xmath66 only . for comparison with previous work",
    "we compare the area and the noise level of selected mm / submm deep field survey to the less in fig.[submm - surveys ] .        from the beam - smoothed map we have extracted sources using the false detection rate algorithm ( for a description of this method see e.g.",
    "* ) of the crush package @xcite .",
    "the choice of beam smoothing becomes obvious if one considers the maximum likelihood amplitude @xmath67 of a point source ( i.e.  the beam @xmath68 ) fitted at a given position @xmath69 in the map @xmath70 . consider a weighted @xmath71 of the fit defined in the usual way as : @xmath72 ^ 2.\\ ] ] then , the @xmath71 minimizing condition @xmath73 yields a maximum - likelihood amplitude : @xmath74 which is effectively the weighted beam smoothed image .",
    "thus , the flux values of the beam - smoothed map essentially measure the fitted beam amplitudes at each map position ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the algorithm uses as in input parameter the allowed number of false detections .",
    "based on this number and the field / beam size we calculate as an initial search criterion a detection signal - to - noise cutoff level assuming gaussian noise statistics . when identifying source candidates , we allow for the possibility that the true peak may fall between pixels by appropriately relaxing the initial search signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "then for each source candidate , we interpolate the neighboring pixel values to estimate the underlying peak and its position , and keep only candidates that meet the original detection s / n level .",
    "we also apply the same procedure to identify negative noise peaks .",
    "these we use to check if the false detection rate is consistent with gaussian noise , or to adjust the empirical noise distribution for possible deviations thereof .",
    "the source candidates thus identified are removed from the map using the appropriate large - scale - structure ( lss ) filtered beam profiles .",
    "lss filtering corrections are also calculated for each pair of source candidates .",
    "the maps are flagged around the extracted source positions .",
    "after the extraction step , the zero flux level of the map is re - estimated via the mode of the pixel distribution ( which we consider the most robust measure in this case ) .",
    "we also re - estimate the width of the noise distribution using robust measures .",
    "the extraction steps are repeated until no further candidates are identified .",
    "for each candidate , we calculate a detection probability based on the number of sources detected beforehand and of the number noise peaks found ( or expected ) below the corresponding inverted significance level , under the assumption of a symmetric noise probability distribution .",
    "finally , the candidates are sorted in order of decreasing detection probability . for each source",
    "we indicate the corresponding cumulative false detection rate in table[sourcelist ] .          to test the reliability of our extraction process and to obtain information on the completeness of our catalog we ran our extraction algorithm on 100 jackknife noise realizations after inserting artificial sources .",
    "the sources were added at random positions for each jackknife map and therefore represent an unclustered source population . for the source flux distribution we used a power law consistent with",
    "the differential source counts derived in sect.[sect - diffcounts ] .",
    "simulated sources were inserted down to a flux level of 1.0 mjy , i.e. well below our detection threshold for individual source . the total number of simulated source per jackknife map was @xmath75 .",
    "the large number of sources implies that the effect of confusion noise is taken into account in our extraction . the completeness computed from these simulations",
    "is shown in middle panel of fig.[fig - completness ] .",
    "the figure shows that our source extraction is complete ( @xmath76 ) down to an input source flux of @xmath77mjy while the 50% completeness level occurs at @xmath78mjy .",
    "we also used our monte - carlo simulations to estimate the accuracy of the source coordinates determined by our source extraction algorithm .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - completness ] , where we plot the positional difference between input and extracted position as a function of the measured signal - to - noise ratio of the extracted sources .",
    "the mean positional uncertainty is in good agreement with eq.b22 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* red line ) .",
    "the scatter in the low s / n bins ( @xmath79 ) , however , is large which implies that the positional uncertainties from aboves equation are only correct in a statistical sense and that the true offset of an individual source can be much larger . from the simulations we find that for our extraction limit ( s / n @xmath80 ) @xmath76 of the sources will have a positional accuracy better than @xmath81 . for the brightest sources ( s / n @xmath82 )",
    "the 95% confidence radius is @xmath83 .",
    "+ we note that because of the large number of independent observations in our map the telescope pointing accuracy will not affect the astrometry of our sources but result in a small ( @xmath84 ) spatial smearing of their signals .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute astrometry of our map has been tested based on our stacking analysis of a sample of near - ir selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "these stacks give signals with up to @xmath85 significance centered on the expected position for different k - band selected source populations and result in signal profiles in agreement with the beam shape . from this",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for an overall mean astrometric error of our data .",
    "this is also confirmed by a comparison of the 1.4ghz radio relative to the submm positions ( ivison  in prep . ) .",
    "signal - to - noise limited source catalogs carry a selection bias from an overabundance of sources whose apparent flux is positively enhanced by noise .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - completness ] where we compare the extracted flux densities to the input flux densities of our monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the discrepancy between intrinsic fluxes and their detection values becomes noticeable below @xmath86mjy .",
    "this effect arises because the steepness of submm number counts implies that an observed flux @xmath87 more often arises from intrinsic fluxes @xmath88 and less often from @xmath89 .",
    "the average flux value @xmath90 behind an observed flux @xmath91 can be calculated statistically : @xmath92 according to bayesian theory , @xmath93 .",
    "the probability density @xmath94 of observing a flux @xmath87 for an underlying flux @xmath95 is simply the noise distribution evaluated at the flux difference , i.e.  @xmath96 . for gaussian noise @xmath97",
    "is calculated as @xmath98 .",
    "the term @xmath99 is the probability density of flux @xmath95 in the underlying noiseless flux distribution of the map , which accounts for the possibility of overlapping sources . as such ,",
    "@xmath99 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : compound - dist ] and is a direct product of our @xmath100 analysis for the source number counts ( see sec .",
    "[ pd - analysis ] ) .",
    "a slight complication arises because the map zeroing is biased by the the presence of sources below detection level .",
    "if the map zero level corresponds to an intrinsic flux @xmath101 , then a map flux @xmath95 really belongs to an underlying value @xmath102 .",
    "fortunately , this @xmath101 is also readily produced by the @xmath100 analysis . with the necessary modifications in place we can calculate deboosted fluxes using @xmath103",
    "the integration can be performed numerically .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty @xmath3 of the deboosted flux can also be calculated as @xmath104 , i.e. , as    @xmath105    the uncertainty of the deboosted flux is typically larger than the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the effect is more more pronounced at the lower fluxes .    to calculate the deboosted fluxes for each source we have used @xmath99 and @xmath101 from the single powerlaw fit from our p(d ) analysis derived in sect.[pd - analysis ] .",
    "note that this is not an iterative process because the p(d ) fitting does not require information on the underlying counts .      while our map has a uniform noise of 1.2mjy beam@xmath29 over 900 sq .",

    "arcmin has only slightly higher noise , @xmath106  mjybeam@xmath29 ( i.e. better than most previous surveys , see fig .",
    "[ submm - surveys ] ) , hence we expand our search area to allow us to find slightly brighter sources outside the uniform region ( see fig .",
    "[ cdfs - flux ] ) . to construct a robust catalog we restricted the extraction in such a way to give statistically 5 false detections .",
    "this yields a total of 126 sources that are listed in table [ sourcelist ] .",

[ deboost ] ) , the signal - to - noise ratio and the expected number of false detections for all sources including the corresponding entry in the table . from the last entry in the table",
    "it can be seen that only 10 additional sources are included in the catalog if we increase the fdr from 3 to 5 for the full catalog .",

    "a source was considered to be detected if the extraction fell within a @xmath81 search radius ( the maximum positional uncertainty expected for our extraction , see [ sect - completness ] ) from the input position .",
    "the fdrs derived in both ways agree very well with a slight tendency of our extraction algorithm to overestimate the fdr ( for 5 expected false detection we find 4 from our monte - carlo simulations ) .    to verify that our map does not contain false sources due to artefacts in the data or the data processing we split our observations into two parts .",
    "this was done by splitting the randomized scan list ( 2370 scans in total ) into two lists with roughly equal integration time yields two independent maps with noise levels of @xmath109mjybeam@xmath2 .",
    "we then performed our source extraction on both maps using the same significance level we used for the generation of our source catalog ( 3.7@xmath3 ) .",

    "for those sources that only appear in one of the two catalogs ( 37/38 for map 1/2 ) we have extracted the snr peaks in a @xmath81 search radius on the map where the source is not detected and computed the probability that no source is present in this aperture . from this analysis we find that the probability of a false detection exceeds 10% for just 7(/6 ) source for submap 1(/2 ) which is in reasonable agreement with the 5 false detections expected from our extractions .",

    "it can be seen that the powerlaw fit by @xcite is consistent with our most significant data point at an angular distance of @xmath182 and that our smaller clustering angle mainly results from the small angular correlation for distances between @xmath183 in our data .",

    "<S> we present a sensitive 870  survey of the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) combining 310 hours of observing time with the large apex bolometer camera ( laboca ) on the apex telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the laboca ecdfs submillimetre survey ( less ) covers the full @xmath0 field size of the ecdfs and has a uniform noise level of @xmath1mjybeam@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> less is thus the largest contiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date . </S>",
    "<S> the noise properties of our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected by confusion noise . </S>",
    "<S> we present a catalog of 126 submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) detected with a significance level above 3.7@xmath3 , at which level we expect 5 false detections given our map area of 1260 arcmin@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> + the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative to previously studied blank fields but not of normal star - forming galaxies that dominate the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with the underdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populations in the ecdfs ( bzks , drgs , optically bright agn and massive k - band selected galaxies ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differential source counts in the full field are well described by a power law with a slope of @xmath5 , comparable to the results from other fields . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across the field . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it steepens in regions with low smg density . towards the highest overdensities we measure a source - count shape consistent with previous surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated 870flux densities of our source - count models down to @xmath6mjy account for @xmath7 of the estimated ebl from _ cobe _ measurements . we have investigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two - point correlation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales @xmath8 with a significance of @xmath9 . assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typical redshift distribution for the smgs we derive a characteristic angular clustering scale of @xmath10 and a spatial correlation length of @xmath11mpc . </S>"
