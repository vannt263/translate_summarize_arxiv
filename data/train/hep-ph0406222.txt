    "data from inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering off polarized targets  @xcite and from upcoming polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic  @xcite continue to improve on our knowledge on the polarized parton distributions in the nucleon .",

    "they can be used to predict cross sections in collisions of hadrons with fixed spin orientation .    in the near future",
    ", one could therefore envisage to study polarized hadronic collisions not only to probe the structure of the colliding hadrons , but also to employ the polarization information in searches for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "so far , there is very little theoretical work in this direction .",
    "the only comprehensive studies of new physics searches in polarized hadronic collisions to date concern the effects of contact interactions  @xcite and of new gauge bosons  @xcite on spin asymmetries at rhic and hera .",
    "it was found that polarization information can yield vital insights , such as discriminating different types of contact interactions that yield identical signatures at unpolarized colliders .",
    "likewise , one would expect that the additional information would strongly improve the study of other new physics scenarios .",
    "probably the most promising scenarios for physics beyond the standard model is its supersymmetric extension , formulated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "the effects of beam polarization in supersymmetric particle production have been studied in detail  @xcite for a future linear electron ",
    "positron collider  @xcite . in the same context ,",
    "fermion pair production in polarized photon - photon collisions  @xcite and gluino pair production in polarized electron - position and polarized direct photon - photon collisions have been examined  @xcite . in all these studies , it was demonstrated that beam polarization asymmetries could be helpful in determining several parameters of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "spin asymmetries in supersymmetric particle production at hadron colliders have so far been considered in early studies adressing particular partonic production channels for squark and gluino production  @xcite and scalar lepton production  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the production of squarks and gluinos at hadron colliders is a qcd process and depends only on the squark and gluino masses , thus allowing a precise prediction  @xcite independent of other parameters of the mssm .",
    "the expected cross sections for present and future hadron colliders turn out to be sizable and are further enhanced by qcd next - to - leading order corrections  @xcite .",
    "non - observation of squark and gluino signatures at the tevatron thus turns into stringent limits on the squark and gluino masses in the framework of the mssm  @xcite : @xmath0  gev , @xmath1  gev .",
    "these limits are substantially weakened if more complicated supersymmetric models than the mssm are considered . in such non - minimal realizations of supersymmetry , squark and gluino production",
    "is also mediated by qcd interactions , thus yielding the same production cross sections as in the mssm .",
    "unfortunately , the non - standard decay modes of squarks and gluinos in these models can not be distinguished from background processes at unpolarized colliders .",
    "one such model was for example advocated to explain an apparent excess in the bottom production cross section at the tevatron  @xcite , predicting gluino and squark masses as low as several gev .    in the present paper",

    "obviously , this is not sufficient to produce the mssm sparticles ; however they could be within reach if supersymmetry is realized in a more exotic scenario . to illustrate the potential of a future polarized hadron collider with a centre - of - mass energy comparable to tevatron or lhc",
    ", we also study the anticipated spin asymmetries at polarized versions of tevatron and lhc . up to now",
    ", beam polarization has not been considered as a realistic upgrade option for these colliders , in part because the physics potential of such an option was not studied . with this paper",

    "thus the predicted asymmetries are less reliable in energy and mass ranges where initial gluons are important .",
    "however , data on single inclusive hadron production and on jet production from rhic will soon improve our knowledge on the polarized gluon distribution , such that more accurate predictions will become feasible .",
    "on the other hand , squark - squark production asymmetries which only requires quark - quark initial states are already quite accurate .",
    "+   +       +   +     +   +     +   +    the squark and gluino production cross sections and asymmetries depend on their masses . in the absence of observational evidence for supersymmetric particle production ,",
    "these masses are unknown . within the mssm",
    ", one can derive the mass bounds  @xcite @xmath0  gev , @xmath1  gev ; in more complicated scenarios they are significantly weaker . to exhibit the spin asymmetries",
    "one could expect , we scan the space of squark and gluino mass parameters . the results are displayed in figures  [ m_lhc_sum_diff_asym_qqbar][m_lhc_sum_diff_asym_qg ] .    while the unpolarized and polarized cross sections fall rapidly with increasing sparticle masses",
    ", the asymmetry ( ratio of polarized to unpolarized cross section ) rises .",
    "this is because the ratio of polarized to unpolarized parton distributions is largest for @xmath89 . in all squark - antisquark and squark - squark production asymmetries",
    ", one observes a sensitivity to the gluino mass , although the gluino appears in these processes only as an exchange particle .",
    "this feature could eventually be used to put constraints on the gluino mass from asymmetries in squark production , even if direct observation of the gluino is beyond the reach of the available collider .",
    "a similar determination from the unpolarized cross section would require a very precise absolute measurement of this cross section , and an equally precise theoretical understanding .",
    "in contrast , gluino production is only weakly dependent on the squark mass .",
    "we see that production asymmetries can reach 10%20% for sparticle production at rhic and tevatron and and up to 4% at the lhc for the ranges of parameters plotted here .",
    "the reason for this lies again in the mass dependence of the asymmetry ; for higher sparticle masses , asymmetries at lhc are even larger . however , as will be shown in section  [ sec : errors ] below , not enough events can be observed at these masses to allow a measurement of an asymmetry .      from the unpolarized cross sections we can estimate the statistical errors for the measurement of the spin asymmetries .",
    "we will use the luminosity specifications postulated above for rhic and the polarized options of tevatron and lhc .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the experimentally measured asymmetry is given by : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the polarisation of the two colliding beams and @xmath93 are defined as follows @xmath94 @xmath95 is the number of events counted with beams @xmath96- and @xmath97-polarised , normalised by the luminosity for this polarisation configuration .",
    "the statistical error @xmath98 for this measurement is given by : @xmath99 we assume that the results of the counts for @xmath100 and @xmath101 are poisson distributed and that the error on @xmath93 due to the errors on the polarisation of the beams and on the luminosity are small compared to the deviation due to the poisson statistic .",
    "the error on @xmath93 is then @xmath102    and for a small deviation we get for @xmath103 : @xmath104 the expectation value of this expression gives @xmath105 : @xmath106 the final result for the statistical error of the asymmetry is obtained by inserting the deviation @xmath107 and expressing the result as a function of the asymmetry @xmath58 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 the expected statistical errors are collected in figures [ m_stat_rhic]-[m_stat_lhc ] .",
    "for all three collider scenarios , the statistical errors grow with increasing sparticle masses such that statistically significant measurements are especially possible for low masses .    at",
    "rhic the situation is quite favourable for @xmath110 gev , except in squark - squark production .",
    "this process is a pure gluino @xmath111-channel exchange which is suppressed by the gluino mass . at tevatron , with a total integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath112 ,",
    "the statistical error starts getting important in the region @xmath113 gev ; the exception is squark - squark production where the statistical error is larger than the asymmetry everywhere . at tevatron",
    ", squark - squark production is particularly suppressed because the quark - quark luminosity is lower at a proton - antiproton collider than at a proton - proton collider .    at lhc , with a total integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath112 , all channels ( with the exception of squark - squark production with large gluino mass ) display only moderate errors even up to sparticle masses of 1000  gev .",
    "therefore a measurement of spin asymmetries at lhc would be especially interesting , despite their apparent smallness .    in a realistic measurement",
    "it will be very difficult to distinguish between squark - antisquark and squark - squark final states and both might have to be summed over .",
    "the summed cross sections are mostly dominated by squark - antisquark final states , and the combined asymmetry would be of similar magnitude as the squark - antisquark asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we have established measurable spin asymmetries in inclusive squark and gluino production for a wide range of sparticle masses . in a measurement ,",
    "one is however often not able to detect particles over the fully inclusive final state phase space but only in restricted ranges in the final state transverse momentum and rapidity .",
    "it is therefore important to study the dependence of the cross sections and asymmetries on the sparticle rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "+   +     +   +    the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized and polarized cross sections are displayed in figure  [ trans_all_sum_diff ] .",
    "we observe that the majority of the sparticles are produced with sizable transverse momentum of about @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , for almost all final states , we observe that the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized and polarized cross sections differ substantially . at the lhc ,",
    "all polarized distributions change their sign between small and large transverse momenta .",
    "a similar feature is observed in some distributions at rhic and the tevatron .",
    "this behaviour reflects in part the structure of the polarized matrix elements , but also the form of the polarized parton distribution functions .    at large transverse momenta",
    ", most polarized distributions fall off slower than their unpolarized counterparts .",
    "the explanation for this feature lies in the ratio between polarized and unpolarized parton distributions which increases towards larger values of @xmath67 , corresponding to large values of the transverse momentum .",
    "the rapidity distributions , figure  [ rap_all_sum_diff ] , are more uniform than the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "most polarized distributions follow their unpolarized counterparts rather closely , showing in general a slower decrease towards larger rapidities .",
    "the features of polarized and unpolarized transverse momentum and rapidity distributions become particularly visible in corresponding asymmetries , figures  [ trans_asym ] and  [ rap_asym ] .",
    "it can be seen that the transverse momentum spectrum of the spin asymmetry increases towards larger transverse momenta for all colliders and all final states .",
    "several spectra display a zero . on the contrary ,",
    "the rapidity dependence of the spin asymmetries is rather flat , especially in the experimentally most relevant central rapidity region .",
    "in this paper , we have studied spin asymmetries in squark and gluino production at polarized hadron colliders to leading order in qcd .",
    "we consider three scenarios , the currently operational polarized proton - proton collider rhic and hypothetical polarized versions of the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "for all three colliders , we find sizable spin asymmetries . assuming the design luminosities and beam polarization of 70% , the asymmetries are statistically measurable for sparticle masses up to 75  gev at rhic , 350  gev at the tevatron and well above 1  tev at lhc , provided experimental systematic uncertainties on them can be kept under control .",
    "if supersymmetry is realized in nature , one would expect to see visible signatures of squarks and gluinos already in unpolarized hadronic collisions at the tevatron or the lhc , depending on the particle masses .",
    "a subsequent measurement of spin asymmetries at potential polarized versions of these colliders could be vital to give detailed insights into the new physics and may distinguish between different supersymmetric models ( or any other new physics idea ) .",
    "for instance , if ( heavy ) quarks and related squarks have similar masses and therefore similar production rates , the corresponding asymmetries are different .",
    "an asymmetry measurement could thus exclude a light bottom squark effectively or distinguish between a heavy fourth generation quark and a supersymmetric particle .",
    "it would also be quite significant if the sparticle masses are quite different from each other .",
    "for instance , as shown in the text , spin asymmetries in squark - antisquark production could be used to infer the gluino mass , even if direct gluino observation is beyond the kinematical reach of the collider .",
    "apart from the additional information it provides , the spin asymmetry can also be measured with much less uncertainty than cross sections .",
    "as explained in the text , spin asymmetries are insensitivity to absolute normalisation , which turns out to be a serious challenge at hadron colliders .",
    "we expect to have detailed knowledge of the required polarized parton distributions after measurements at rhic and compass have been completed .",
    "our results contribute to making a physics case for a new polarized hadron collider at energies above rhic or for an upgrade of an existing and planned high energy colliders to polarized hadrons .",
    "there are further phenomenological applications .",
    "one particular aspect of using polarized initial states is that they offer the possibility to obtain event samples enriched either in @xmath115- or @xmath10-squarks which can not be discriminated at unpolarized hadron colliders .",
    "a precise study of spin asymmetries in squark and gluino production would not only require an improved understanding of the spin - dependent parton distributions , but also the inclusion of next - to - leading order corrections to the partonic scattering processes .",
    "these are available for unpolarized squark and gluino production  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the spin - dependent nlo corrections would resemble the nlo calculation of heavy quark production at polarized hadron colliders , which was completed some time ago  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as pointed out already in  @xcite , the nlo corrections to the polarized cross section for @xmath116 could already be obtained from the results on spin - dependent heavy quark production .    one possible environment to study polarized partonic scattering processes",
    "would be photon - photon interactions at a future linear collider  @xcite , either realized by tagging onto bremsstrahlung photons or with a dedicated photon - photon programme using high energy photon beams generated by laser backscattering . in both options ,",
    "the photon beams would be polarized .",
    "the polarized cross sections for squark and gluino production in direct and resolved photon interactions can be readily obtained from the formulae presented here .",
    "the polarized parton distributions in the photon are at present completely unconstrained by experimental data , theoretical models for them exist and put upper and lower boundaries on their magnitude  @xcite .",
    "knowledge on them could furthermore be improved by studying spin asymmetries in standard model reactions in photon - photon collisions .",
    "we would like to thank philip ratcliffe for pointing our attention to  @xcite and for useful discussions .",
