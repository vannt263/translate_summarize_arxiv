    "in a range of applications we often seek curves and surfaces that have an aesthetically pleasing ` roundedness ' to them .",
    "one way to make this concept concrete is through looking for globally - optimised ` minimum variation curves '  @xcite .",
    "the philosophy behind this idea is straightforward .",
    "we usually prefer curves that are close to circular over curves with sharp turns .",
    "this is particularly true when designing camera trajectories , where sudden changes in curvature can have a very disorienting effect .",
    "circular paths are characterised by having constant curvature , so a natural idea in forming interpolations between control points is to find a curve that minimises the total change in curvature .",
    "the problem with such a strategy is that these curves can be extremely hard to compute . if one adopted a variational strategy , with endpoint conditions , the equations for the curve can be as high as fifth order and are even more difficult to treat than those of elasticity .",
    "such equations can only be solved numerically and do not have straightforward , controllable , analytic solutions .",
    "the problem is even more acute if multiple control points are involved , as even numerical computation can be extremely difficult .",
    "a more straightforward , local scheme that provides smooth interpolations was introduced by wenz  @xcite and later extended by szilvsi - nagy & vendel  @xcite .",
    "the idea explored by these authors is to generate curves that are as close as possible to circles . given four points @xmath1 we construct the circles @xmath2 through @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 through @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 . the curve between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is then formed by smoothly interpolating between the two circles .",
    "this idea was further extended by squin & yen  @xcite and squin & lee  @xcite , who introduced an angle - based circle blending scheme .",
    "the angle - based scheme gives better results than the earlier , midpoint scheme , and we argue here that it is geometrically the ` correct ' one .",
    "squin & lee also showed how to achieve @xmath8-continuity ( and higher order continuity , if desired ) , and demonstrated the value of angle - based blending for interpolating over the surface of a sphere .",
    "in this paper we further explore the geometry associated with circle blending , following the methods developed by squin and his coworkers .",
    "the essential idea is that the natural way to transform between two circles is via a _ conformal _ transformation .",
    "conformal transformations leave angles invariant , but can alter distances .",
    "euclidean transformations are the subset of conformal transformations that also leave distances invariant .",
    "conformal transformations in a plane can take any three chosen points to any three image points .",
    "as such , they can transform a line or circle into any other circle . in this geometry ,",
    "straight lines are examples of circles that pass through the point at infinity . by exploiting the features of conformal geometry",
    ", we can write robust code that treats ( straight ) lines and circles in a single , unified manner .",
    "this eliminates the need to check for special cases .",
    "similarly , in three dimensions , planes and spheres are treated as examples of the same object .",
    "so a single routine can interpolate between points on a sphere , and will reduce to the planar case when four points happen to lie in a plane .",
    "to fully exploit the advantages of conformal geometry we work in the mathematical framework of _ geometric algebra _",
    "this algebra treats points , lines , circles , planes and spheres , and the transformations acting on them , in a unified algebraic framework .",
    "a number of authors have argued for the advantages of the _ conformal geometric algebra _",
    "framework for computer graphics applications  @xcite .",
    "the present work should be viewed in this context .",
    "we show how complex problems such as finding the conformal transformation between a line and a circle reduce to simple , robust expressions in the geometric algebra framework . as a further application",
    "we show how the same framework naturally extends to sphere - blending over a surface .",
    "this suggests a new method of characterising surfaces that does not require the concept of swept curves .",
    "this paper starts with an introduction to conformal geometric algebra .",
    "this introduction is self - contained , but to keep its length down a number of concepts are introduced with a minimum of explanation .",
    "we then turn to the question of how to mathematically encode transformations between circles .",
    "we find the conformal transformation that achieves this and explore its properties .",
    "some subtleties involving the orientation of the transformation are explained , and we demonstrate how they are easily resolved in the conformal framework .",
    "we then provide a series of examples of blended curves , and illustrate the effects of demanding higher - order @xmath0-continuity .",
    "we finish by introducing a method of sphere blending and discuss the potential of this idea for encoding surfaces .",
    "the starting point for our description of geometry is the conformal group .",
    "this marks a radical departure from conventional descriptions of euclidean space based on projective geometry and homogeneous coordinates .",
    "the main advantage of basing the description in a conformal setting is that _ distance _ is encoded simply , making the geometry well suited to describing the real three - dimensional world .",
    "suppose we start with an @xmath9-dimensional euclidean vector space @xmath10 .",
    "the conformal group consists of the set of all transformations of @xmath10 that leave angles invariant .",
    "these include translations and rotations , so the conformal group includes the set of euclidean transformations as a subgroup .",
    "the conformal group on @xmath10 has a natural representation in terms of rotations in a space two dimensions higher , with signature @xmath11 .",
    "so , in the same way that projective transformations are linearised by working in a space one dimension higher than the euclidean base space , conformal transformations are linearised in a space two dimensions higher . the conformal representation of points in euclidean three - space consists of vectors in a 5-dimensional space .",
    "while this may appear to be an unnecessary abstraction , working in this five - dimensional space does bring a number of advantages .    to exploit the conformal representation we need a standard representation for a euclidean point in the five - dimensional conformal space .",
    "given that we are occupying a space two dimensions higher , two constraints are required to specify a unique point .",
    "the first of these is that our underlying representation is homogeneous , so @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the same point in euclidean space .",
    "the second constraint is that the vector @xmath12 is _ null _ , @xmath14 ( the existence of null vectors is guaranteed by the fact that the conformal vector space has mixed signature . )",
    "this is essentially the only further constraint that can be enforced which is consistent with homogeneity and invariant under orthogonal transformations in conformal space .",
    "now suppose that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent three vectors in the three - dimensional base space , and we add to these the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these satisfy @xmath20 and all 5 vectors @xmath21 are orthogonal . from the two extra vectors we define the two null vectors @xmath9 and @xmath22 by @xmath23 ( it is a straightforward exercise to confirm that these two vectors both have zero magnitude . ) from these we need to chose a vector to represent the origin . this",
    "is conventionally taken as @xmath24 .",
    "the vector @xmath12 can therefore be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the equivalent three - vector representation of the point in euclidean space .",
    "the variable @xmath27 must be chosen so that @xmath12 is null , which fixes @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore arrive at the following representation of a point in conformal space : @xmath29 this representation can be arrived at using more geometrical reasoning by considering a stereographic projection  @xcite .",
    "it is immediately clear from equation   that @xmath9 represents the point at infinity .",
    "the euclidean coordinates of the point @xmath26 are recovered from @xmath12 via the homogeneous relation @xmath30 this relation confirms that @xmath12 and @xmath31 define the same euclidean point . in principle",
    ", one could allow for @xmath32 to be negative , but in practice this should be avoided .",
    "restricting to positive @xmath32 is is equivalent to stating that @xmath12 must always have a positive @xmath18 component .",
    "the reason for this restriction can be seen in figure  [ fnullcone ] .",
    "the equation @xmath33 generates a cone structure , and we only want to employ one half of this to represent points . maintaining a positive @xmath18 component throughout all algorithms enables us to keep track of orientations consistently .",
    "given a point @xmath34 , represented by the unnormalised vector @xmath35 , we can place @xmath35 in the standard form of equation   with the map @xmath36 one should be wary of employing this map when writing code , as the right - hand side is singular if @xmath35 happens to be the point at infinity . as is the case for projective geometry , it is better practice to let the normalisation run free , and only use equation   in the final stage to recover the coordinates .",
    "the set of null vectors form a cone . to ensure a unique representation of points that maintains orientation , we restrict to the subsection with positive @xmath18 component .",
    "the set of vectors satisfying @xmath37 defines the ` standard ' representation of points , in this case defining the conformal representation of a one - dimensional space.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   the set of null vectors form a cone . to ensure a unique representation of points that maintains orientation , we restrict to the subsection with positive @xmath18 component .",
    "the set of vectors satisfying @xmath37 defines the ` standard ' representation of points , in this case defining the conformal representation of a one - dimensional space.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    the power of the conformal representation starts to become clear when we consider the inner product of points .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 and @xmath38 are the conformal representations of the points @xmath26 and @xmath39 respectively , both in the standard form of equation  .",
    "their inner product is @xmath40 this is the essential result that underpins the conformal approach to euclidean geometry .",
    "the inner product in conformal space encodes the _ distance _ between points in euclidean space .",
    "this is the reason why points are represented with null vectors  the distance between a point and itself is zero .",
    "generalising equation   to unnormalised vectors , the distance between points can be written @xmath41 any transformation of @xmath12 and @xmath38 that leaves this product invariant must represent a symmetry of euclidean space . because such a transformation must leave the inner product invariant , it must be an orthogonal transformation in conformal space .",
    "such a transformation ensures that null vectors remain null vectors , and so continue to represent points .",
    "the transformation must also leave @xmath9 invariant if the distance is to remain unchanged .",
    "we can now see that the euclidean group is the subgroup of conformal transformations that leaves invariant the point at infinity . in",
    "what follows we will find applications for both euclidean and more general conformal transformations .",
    "_ geometric algebra _ was introduced by the nineteenth century mathematician w.k .",
    "clifford , and has found many applications in physics  @xcite . often in this work",
    "clifford algebra _ is used , but for applications in geometry it is becoming increasingly common to see clifford s original name of geometric algebra to describe the field .",
    "a geometric algebra is constructed over a vector space with a given inner product .",
    "the _ geometric _ product of two vectors @xmath34 and @xmath42 is defined to be associative and distributive over addition , with the additional rule that the square of any vector is a scalar , @xmath43 if we write @xmath44 we see that the symmetric part of the geometric product of any two vectors is also a scalar .",
    "this defines the inner product , and we write @xmath45 the remaining , antisymmetric part of the geometric product returns the _ outer _ or _ exterior _ product familiar from projective geometry .",
    "we write this as @xmath46 the totally antisymmetrised sum of geometric products of vectors defines the exterior product in the algebra .    the geometric product of two vectors",
    "can now be written @xmath47 under the geometric product , orthogonal vectors anticommute and parallel vectors commute .",
    "the product therefore encodes the basic geometric relationships between vectors . now that we know how to multiply vectors together",
    ", it is straightforward to construct the entire geometric algebra of a given vector space .",
    "this is facilitated by introducing an orthonormal frame of vectors @xmath48 .",
    "these satisfy @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the metric tensor . for a space of signature @xmath51",
    ", @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix consisting of @xmath52 @xmath53s and @xmath54 @xmath55s .",
    "the space of interest to us here is the conformal space of signature @xmath56 .",
    "a basis for this is provided by the vectors @xmath57 , with @xmath18 having negative square .",
    "the algebra generated by these vectors has 32 terms in total , and is spanned by @xmath58 we refer to this algebra as @xmath59 .",
    "the term ` grade ' is used to refer to the number of vectors in any exterior product .",
    "the dimensions of each graded subspace are given by the binomial coefficients .",
    "the highest grade term in @xmath59 is called the _",
    "pseudoscalar _ and is given the symbol @xmath60 .",
    "this is defined by @xmath61 the pseudoscalar commutes with all elements in the algebra , a feature of odd - dimensional algebras , and the @xmath56 signature of the space implies that the pseudoscalar satisfies @xmath62 so , algebraically , @xmath60 has the properties of a unit imaginary .",
    "but it also plays a definite geometric role , as multiplication by the pseudoscalar performs a duality transformation in conformal space .",
    "a matrix representation of @xmath59 can be constructed in terms of @xmath63 complex matrices .",
    "these can be found in the physics literature in the guise of the dirac matrices  @xcite . for practical applications",
    "this matrix representation has little value and one is better off coding up the algebraic rules explicitly .",
    "a general element of @xmath59 is called a _ multivector _ and can consist of a sum of terms all grades in the algebra .",
    "arbitrary elements of @xmath59 can be added and multiplied together . a multivector that consists only of terms of a single grade",
    "is said to be _",
    "the geometric product of a pair of homogeneous multivectors decomposes as follows : @xmath64 the angle brackets @xmath65 are used to denote the projection onto the grade-@xmath66 terms in @xmath67 .",
    "the dot and wedge symbols are used to generalise the inner and outer products to the lowest and highest grade terms in a general product : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are homogeneous multivectors of grade @xmath66 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "one only ever uses the dot and wedge symbols when applied to homogeneous multivectors .",
    "of particular importance are the inner and outer products with a vector .",
    "these satisfy @xmath72 some straightforward algebra confirms that the outer product is associative  @xcite .",
    "an important algebraic operation applied to multivectors is _",
    "reversion_. this plays an analogous role to transposition in matrix algebra .",
    "the reverse of a multivector @xmath67 is denoted by @xmath73 and is defined by reversing the order of all geometric products of vectors in @xmath67 .",
    "an arbitrary multivector in @xmath59 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath27 and @xmath75 are scalars , @xmath34 and @xmath42 are vectors , @xmath76 is a bivector and @xmath77 is a trivector .",
    "the reverse of @xmath67 is then given by @xmath78    a conformal transformation in the euclidean space @xmath79 is represented by an orthogonal transformation in @xmath59 .",
    "of particular relevance here are special conformal transformations .",
    "these have determinant @xmath53 , and correspond to orientation - preserving transformations on @xmath79 . in geometric algebra a special conformal transformation , applied to an arbitrary multivector @xmath35 , can be written in the compact form @xmath80 here @xmath81 is an even - grade element ( grades 0 , 2 and 4 ) satisfying @xmath82 because our representation is homogeneous , this normalisation constraint can usually be relaxed to allow for @xmath83 to be an arbitrary positive scalar .",
    "the element @xmath81 is called a _ rotor_. as an example , the ( unnormalised ) rotor for the euclidean translation between @xmath26 and @xmath39 can be written @xmath84 where @xmath12 and @xmath38 are the conformal equivalents of @xmath26 and @xmath39 respectively . every rotor can be written in term of the exponential of a bivector as @xmath85 the bivector @xmath76 is the generator of the rotation , and is an element of the lie algebra of the conformal group .",
    "we have now established how points in @xmath79 are represented by null vectors in the conformal algebra @xmath59 .",
    "we now need to establish how higher dimensional objects are represented . given a null vector @xmath38 , one view of the point this represents is as the solution space of the equation @xmath86 where here @xmath12 is treated as a vector variable .",
    "this is a similar idea to projective geometry , and generalises immediately to higher - grade objects . given a multivector @xmath69 , the outer product of @xmath66 distinct vectors , the geometric object that this represents is the solution space of @xmath87 this pair of equations is clearly homogeneous in @xmath12 .",
    "if a conformal transformation is applied to @xmath69 , taking it to @xmath88 , then the solution space transforms in exactly the same way ( that is , @xmath89 ) . in this manner",
    "conformal transformations are easily applied to higher - grade objects .",
    "after vectors , the next objects to consider are bivectors .",
    "given a bivector @xmath76 ( formed from the outer product of two vectors ) , the solution space of equation   depends on the sign of @xmath90 . if @xmath90 is negative there are no solutions , if @xmath91 there is one solution , and if @xmath90 is positive there are two solutions .",
    "this final case corresponds to the situation where @xmath92 , where @xmath12 and @xmath38 are a pair of null vectors . given a bivector of this form",
    "it is straightforward to recover @xmath12 and @xmath38  @xcite , so a bivector can encode a pair of points .",
    "next consider a trivector @xmath93 .",
    "the main example of relevance is the trivector formed from the outer product of three points @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 , so @xmath94 any vector @xmath12 that is a solution of @xmath95 must be a linear combination of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 is null and has arbitrary scale implies that in @xmath79 the solution space is one - dimensional . to see what this space is ,",
    "consider the null vector @xmath96 , where @xmath97 if @xmath12 satisfies @xmath98 , then @xmath12 commutes with @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 the solution set @xmath12 therefore consists of points at an equal distance from some point @xmath96 .",
    "it follows that the trivector @xmath93 represents the _ circle _ through @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "if this circle also passes through the point at infinity , the line is straight .",
    "that is , the test that a line @xmath93 is straight is that @xmath100 similarly , the straight line through @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath101 conformal algebra therefore treats lines and circles in a unified manner as trivectors in @xmath59 .",
    "this is to be expected , as a conformal transformation can always transform a line into a circle .",
    "the radius @xmath102 of the circle @xmath93 is found from @xmath103 so again we see how a metric object ( the radius ) is recovered from a homogeneous representation of a geometric entity ( the circle @xmath93 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath104 between two circles ( or lines ) is found from @xmath105 as expected , this is invariant under the full conformal group .",
    "similar considerations apply to the 4-vector @xmath106 defined by the four points @xmath107 , @xmath108 the object defined by @xmath106 is the unique sphere through the four points ( which can not all lie on a line or circle if @xmath109 ) .",
    "the centre of the sphere is given by @xmath110 , and if the centre lies at infinity the sphere reduces to a plane . as with the case of a straight line ,",
    "the plane defined by the three points @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 is @xmath111 lines , circles , planes and spheres can all be intersected in a straightforward manner in conformal geometric algebra .",
    "the two cases of greatest significance are those of a circle and a sphere , and of two spheres . treating the latter first , any two spheres intersect in a circle ( provided they touch ) .",
    "this reduces to a line if both spheres are in fact planar .",
    "the intersection @xmath93 is found simply by @xmath112 which is a trivector , as required .",
    "similarly , the intersection of a circle @xmath96 and a sphere @xmath106 is given by @xmath113 this is a bivector , as a circle can intersect a sphere or plane in zero , one , or two points . in the case where @xmath96 is a straight line and",
    "@xmath106 is a flat plane , one of the points of intersection is at infinity .",
    "as we proceed we will see how the orientations implicit in lines and surfaces are neatly encoded in these intersection formulae .",
    "suppose we are given a series of @xmath114 points @xmath115 and we seek a smooth curve through all of these points .",
    "the idea behind the circle blending scheme is to find a curve that is as close as possible to a circle and which passes through all of the points .",
    "a typical setup is illustrated in figure  [ fcircbl1 ] .",
    "consider the four points @xmath116 .",
    "we form the circle @xmath117 through @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and the circle @xmath121 through @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath122 . in the region between @xmath123 and @xmath120",
    "we need a curve that blends smoothly between the circles @xmath117 and @xmath121 .",
    "a range of schemes exist for interpolating between circles , but one is naturally picked out from the viewpoint of conformal geometry .",
    "we are presented with two circles @xmath2 and @xmath6 , both of which share two points in common : @xmath124 given the ( conformal ) points @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the circles @xmath2 and @xmath6 , there are no further objects to specify .",
    "first we need to define family of circles between @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is easily achieved by finding the transformation between them .",
    "the transformation must map between two circles , so is a conformal transformation .",
    "the only bivector generator for such a transformation is the antisymmetrised product between @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "a transformation governed by this generator is simply a rotation in @xmath59 .",
    "if we normalise the circles by defining @xmath125 then the interpolated circle is simply @xmath126 here @xmath104 is the angle between the circles , defined by @xmath127 ( the case of @xmath128 will be addressed shortly . )",
    "this method of interpolating between circles recovers the angle - blending scheme of squin & yen  @xcite , thus providing a firm geometric reason for preferring that scheme . at this point",
    "there is no reason for @xmath2 and @xmath6 to lie in the same plane .",
    "if they lie on different planes then the four points @xmath1 define a sphere . since",
    "the interpolated circles can be written @xmath129 we see that all points on these circles are combinations of @xmath130 .",
    "it follows that all of the intermediate circles also lie of the sphere defined by @xmath131 , which is a desirable property for a range of applications  @xcite .",
    "the basic interpolation scheme is illustrated in figure  [ f2crcs ]        now that we have a straightforward means of encoding the circle blends , we need to parameterise the actual trajectory between the points . a simple means for achieving this is to start with the straight line between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this path is parameterised by @xmath132 and the line itself is described by @xmath133 the rotor that transforms between the line @xmath134 and the circle @xmath135 is simply @xmath136 so once the ( normalised ) blended circle @xmath137 is found , the path itself is given by transforming from the straight line to the circle .",
    "the path between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is therefore simply @xmath138 this is extremely simple to code up .",
    "we never have to calculate the centre of a circle , and the algorithm deals equally easily with straight lines or circles .",
    "the algorithm keeps all intermediate points on the sphere defined by each group of four points .",
    "if all of the base points lie on the same sphere , then we compute smooth curves over this sphere .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure  [ fsphplt ] .",
    "provided the sequence of any four points are unique , the circles to be blended and the intermediate straight line are all well defined .",
    "the only aspects of the algorithm that can be problematic are concerned with the definition of the angle @xmath104 in equation  .",
    "there are two cases over which care must be taken , both of which can be treated fairly easily .",
    "the first obvious problem is that the definition of the blended segment breaks down if @xmath139 , which occurs when @xmath140 and when @xmath141 .",
    "the former case corresponds to @xmath142 and implies that the two curves are the same .",
    "this is easily caught by setting a threshold value for @xmath104 below which eqn   is replaced by the small-@xmath104 limit of @xmath143    the case of @xmath144 is more complicated , and corresponds to a somewhat pathological example .",
    "this occurs when the two circles only differ in their orientation , so @xmath145 .",
    "a sample configuration is shown in figure  [ fpathol ] .",
    "all four points lie in a plane , so the interpolated curve must also lie in this plane .",
    "it is possible to define an interpolation scheme for this case . if we let @xmath146 denote the plane containing the circles , then the generator of the transformation must act in the @xmath146 plane , leaving @xmath4 and @xmath5 invariant .",
    "the bivector generator for the transformation is therefore @xmath147 this produces the type of interpolated curve shown in figure  [ fpathol ] .",
    "the problem here is that this case is not smoothly connected to the general case .",
    "imagine moving one of the control points in figure  [ fpathol ] slightly out of the page .",
    "the four points then define a sphere , and the interpolated curve will lie on this sphere .",
    "this is a totally different curve to the planar case .",
    "if we are only interested in planar plots , then everything is well - behaved and the above case can be easily dealt with .",
    "but if we are interested in curves in three - dimensional space , this case is best avoided altogether with the addition of further control points .",
    "the case of oppositely oriented circles relates to the second key issue , which is what happens if the circles are greater than @xmath148 apart ?",
    "the arccos function will not return the correct angle , and the interpolation scheme will effectively blend the wrong way .",
    "this problem has an elegant solution within the conformal framework .",
    "the question reduces to finding the correct midpoint circle @xmath149 .",
    "this is given by @xmath150 the case of @xmath144 corresponds to equal and opposite circles , which is the one awkward case we have to avoid .",
    "all we need is a test to decide which is the correct mid - circle for the geometry , and the arccos function can be used to determine @xmath151 unambiguously from @xmath152 to find a suitable test we consider the plane of points equidistant from @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this plane is defined by @xmath153 all planes are oriented , so the sign here is important .",
    "this choice corresponds to the normal to the plane ( defined by the right - hand rule ) pointing in the direction from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "now suppose that we intersect a circle @xmath96 with the plane @xmath154 .",
    "the result is two points encoded in the bivector @xmath76 , where @xmath155 the bivector @xmath76 contains the points in the order @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the point where the circle intersects the plane from the negative to positive side , and @xmath158 is the opposite point ( see figure  [ fintplncirc ] ) .",
    ".,width=302 ]    now suppose that @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the midpoints of the circle segments @xmath2 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "both lie in the plane @xmath154 .",
    "the correct mid - circle should have its @xmath157 intersection point closer to the midpoint of @xmath159 and @xmath160 than its @xmath158 point .",
    "if this is not the case , then the circle has the wrong orientation .",
    "we therefore only need form the quantity @xmath161 where @xmath76 is given by equation   with @xmath96 defined by @xmath162 the test is now @xmath163 this conditional statement covers all special cases ( where various circles are degenerate or reduce to straight lines ) and the border cases of @xmath164 is the single degenerate case mentioned above . with",
    "the mid - circle found , the angle @xmath104 is computed , and the interpolation scheme of equation   can be followed .    a further problem with the blending scheme is highlighted in figure  [ fprobcase ] .",
    "the geometry of the control points ensures that an unwanted inversion arises in the middle of the plot .",
    "this is because the gradient at each control point is fixed entirely by the two points on either side ( see section  [ scont ] ) , and so in this case is forced to be flat , as illustrated .",
    "the problem can be removed in a number of ways .",
    "one of the simplest is to define a series of midpoints , and then repeat the blending algorithm .",
    "the result of a single iteration of this type is also shown in figure  [ fprobcase ] .",
    "of course , one can go further and continue to recursively define midpoints , which will also generate a smooth blend .",
    "this latter approach has the attractive feature that it removes the need for any trigonometric evaluations , as the mid - circle is found easily using the method described above .",
    "an important issue in any interpolation scheme is the order of continuity at the control points . in this section",
    "we will only consider @xmath0-continuity . to achieve @xmath96-continuity",
    "some reparameterisation will have to occur on each spline .",
    "for the case of a camera fly - by , this can be achieved by specifying the desired velocity along the curve .",
    "our blending scheme is defined by equation  , and before we can differentiate this we need a result for the derivative of a rotor .",
    "the definition of a ( normalised ) rotor is sufficient to prove that we can always write @xmath165 where @xmath76 is a bivector , which in general will also be a function of @xmath32 .",
    "( the factor of @xmath166 is a useful convention ) . to find the tangent vector to the ( conformal ) curve @xmath167 we form the line @xmath168 where the dash denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath32 . to see how this behaves we return to equation   and form the derivative at @xmath169 . for convenience",
    "we will assume that the rotor in equation   has been normalised , though this is unimportant when forming the tangent vector .",
    "in evaluating the derivatives we can use the results that @xmath170 differentiating these , we see that @xmath171 and these also hold for derivatives of @xmath76 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "on differentiating   we find that ( dropping the subscripts on @xmath81 and @xmath38 ) @xmath172 it follows that @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "the tangent vector at @xmath4 is therefore given by ( up to a scale factor ) @xmath175 but this is precisely the tangent vector to the circle @xmath2 at that point @xmath4 .",
    "so the tangent at each of the control points is defined by the circle through the control point and its two adjoining points .",
    "the tangent vectors at a connection are therefore continuous , which ensures @xmath176 continuity .",
    "next we need to consider @xmath8 continuity . for this",
    "we need the circle @xmath177 evaluating this at @xmath169 we obtain @xmath178 this contains a term in @xmath2 , and an additional term controlled by the bivector @xmath76 ( evaluated at @xmath169 ) .",
    "the first term is the desired one , as it ensures that the radius of curvature at the control point is defined by the circle through it .",
    "the second term is not wanted , and implies that the simple scheme defined by equation   does not guarantee @xmath8 continuity .",
    "this was first pointed out by squin & lee  @xcite . to provide @xmath8 continuity we need",
    "only ensure that the derivative of the interpolating rotor @xmath81 vanishes at the endpoints .",
    "this is simply achieved by replacing equation   with @xmath179 this blending scheme does now have @xmath8 continuity , and is the scheme use to produce the figures in section  [ scblnd ] . in figure  [ fg2comp ]",
    "we show a comparison between the two schemes . as expected , the @xmath8 scheme smoothes out some of the curvature around the control points .",
    "one can extend this idea to obtain any desired order of continuity .",
    "this is achieved by replacing the polynomial in equation   by a higher - order blend .     and",
    "@xmath8 continuity_. the @xmath176 blend is shown on the left , and the @xmath8 blend on the right .",
    "the @xmath8 blend hugs the control points more closely than the @xmath176 case , and for most cases the @xmath8 curves are the more aesthetically satisfying.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   and @xmath8 continuity_. the @xmath176 blend is shown on the left , and the @xmath8 blend on the right .",
    "the @xmath8 blend hugs the control points more closely than the @xmath176 case , and for most cases the @xmath8 curves are the more aesthetically satisfying.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "one can straightforwardly apply the ideas developed here to swept surfaces using a version of the scheme described by szilvsi - nagy & vendel  @xcite .",
    "but in this section we aim to explore an alternative idea , based on sphere blending .",
    "a sphere is described as a 4-vector in the conformal geometric algebra , and these can be transformed and interpolated in a similar manner to circles .    as a simple example ,",
    "suppose that the points @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 define the vertices of a triangle .",
    "to each corner we attach a sphere , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "each sphere passes through the three vertices of the triangle , and a fourth point which can be viewed as a control point .",
    "that is , we can write @xmath183 these assume that none of @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 lie on the circle defined by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "we next need to define a blend over the surface . for this",
    "we introduce the barycentric coordinates @xmath187 , subject to @xmath188 we let @xmath189 denote the conformal representation of the point in the triangle corresponding to the barycentric coordinates @xmath190 .",
    "similarly , we define a ( linear ) sphere blend by @xmath191 we could employ a trigonometric blending scheme over the ( abstract ) sphere defined by the unit 4-vectors @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath192 , but this raises a number of complications .",
    "there is no single straightforward generalisation of barycentric coordinates over a spherical triangle , and each alternative scheme has its own merits and drawbacks  @xcite .",
    "here we have adopted the simplest , linear blending scheme , which generates interesting surfaces .",
    "now that we have the sphere and the point on the triangle defined , all that remains is to define the conformal transformation from the point to the blended surface .",
    "first we define the plane @xmath146 through the three base points , @xmath194 next we define the rotor @xmath81 for the conformal transformation between the plane and the blended sphere , @xmath195 finally , the surface itself is defined by the points @xmath196 , where @xmath197 a typical surface defined in this manner is shown in figure  [ fsph ] .",
    "the result is aesthetically quite pleasing , yielding a smooth blend free of sudden changes in curvature .",
    "much work remains to extend this idea to a complete framework for defining blends over surfaces .",
    "the control points need to be chosen so as to reflect the geometry around the triangle , and continuity between blended spheres may be hard to achieve . here",
    "we hope to have demonstrated that such an approach may be feasible .",
    "smooth splines between control points can be defined in terms of blended circles .",
    "the splines pass through all points , and have no extra control points .",
    "the natural geometric framework for handling circles is conformal geometry .",
    "this geometry is encapsulated in a simple , unified manner by employing the geometric algebra of a five - dimensional space .",
    "all transformations are easily defined , and algorithms can be written in such a way as to minimise problems with special cases .",
    "similar ideas can be applied to sphere blends over a surface , and in future work we will explore the potential of this idea for design and for encoding surface data .",
