    "the reflectivities for the input coupler are 95% for the pump ( 532 nm ) and almost 100% for the signal and idler beams ( 1064 nm ) .",
    "the output coupler ( r=38 mm ) is highly reflecting for the pump and its transmission is 5% for the infrared . at exact triple resonance ,",
    "the oscillation threshold is less than 20 mw , very close to the threshold without the plate @xcite .",
    "the opo is actively locked on the pump resonance by the pound - drever - hall technique : a remaining 12mhz modulation present in the laser is detected by reflection and the error signal is sent to a home - made pi controller .",
    "the crystal temperature is thoroughly controlled within the mk range .",
    "the opo can operate stably during more than one hour without mode - hopping .",
    "the birefringent plate inserted inside the cavity is chosen to be exactly @xmath102 at 1064 nm and almost @xmath105 at the 532 nm pump wavelength .",
    "as birefringence and dispersion are of the same order , this configuration is only possible by choosing multiple - order plate : we have chosen the first order for which exact @xmath102 at 1064 nm is obtained , i.e. @xmath106 at 1064 nm and @xmath107 at 532 nm .",
    "very small rotations of this plate around the cavity axis can be operated thanks to a rotation mount controlled by piezo - electric actuator ( new focus model 8401 and tiny pico - motor ) .",
    "the coherent 1064 nm laser output is used as local oscillator for homodyne detection .",
    "this beam is spatially filtered and intensity - noise cleaned by a triangular - ring 45 cm - long cavity with a high finesse of 3000 .",
    "this cavity is locked on the maximum of transmission by the single - pass tilt - locking technique @xcite and 80% of transmission is obtained .",
    "the homodyne detections are based on pairs of balanced high quantum efficiency ingaas photodiodes ( epitaxx etx300 with a 95% quantum efficiency ) and the fringe visibility reaches 0.97 .",
    "the shot noise level of all measurements is easily obtained by blocking the output of the opo .",
    "orthogonally polarized modes are separated on the first polarizing beam splitter at the output of the opo . a half - wave plate inserted before this polarizing beam splitter enables us to choose the fields to characterize : the signal and idler modes which are entangled , or the @xmath56 rotated modes which are squeezed .    one main requirement of our experiment is to be able to characterize simultaneously two modes with the same phase reference .",
    "the difference photocurrents of the homodyne detections are sent into two spectrum analyzers ( agilent e4411b ) which are triggered by the same signal .",
    "the two homodyne detections are calibrated in order to be in phase : if one send into each detection a state of light with squeezing on the same quadrature , the noise powers registered on the spectrum analyzers must have in - phase variations while scanning the local oscillator phase .",
    "two birefringent plates , @xmath108 and @xmath102 , inserted in the local oscillator path are rotated in order to compensate residual birefringence due in particular to defects associated to polarizing beam splitter . in others",

    "to facilitate this tuning , the opo is operated above threshold in the locking zone where frequency degeneracy occurs . a polarizing beam splitter inserted at the opo output and a @xmath108 plate rotated by @xmath109 permit to send into the two homodyne detections states of light with opposite phase .",

    "two states of light with squeezing on orthogonal quadratures give in - phase squeezing curves on the spectrum analyzers .",
    "in this section , we report on the experimental results obtained for different values of the coupling parameter . as underlined before , we characterize the noise of the @xmath66 rotated modes which have squeezed fluctuations .      in a first series of experiments , the plate angle is adjusted to be almost zero .",
    "this tuning can be done by looking at the individual noises which should be in that case phase - insensitive .",

    "these values give an overall detection efficiency of @xmath122 .",
    "after detection , the expected squeezing is thus reduced to @xmath123 db .",
    "the small discrepancy with the experimental values can be due to the presence of walk - off which limits the modes overlap , a critical point for two - mode squeezing .    from the electronic noise",

    "this criterion is a necessary and sufficient condition of non - separability .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath125 well below the unit limit for inseparability .",
    "it is worth noting that the simultaneous double homodyne detection permits a direct and instantaneous verification of this criterion by adding the two squeezed variances .",
    "the epr criterion is related to an apparent violation of a heisenberg inequality @xcite : the information extracted from the measurement of the two quadratures of one mode provides values for the quadratures of the other mode that violate the heisenberg inequality .",

    "the first experimental demonstration of continuous variable epr entanglement was obtained with such a type ii opo below threshold @xcite . however , the linear coupling  even for a plate rotated by a very small angle  can make easier the finding of experimental parameters for which entanglement is observed .",
    "furthermore , the degenerate operation with bright beams above threshold makes possible to match the homodyne detection without infrared injection of the opo .",
