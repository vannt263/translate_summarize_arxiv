    "there is presently considerable interest in the stellar and sub - stellar components of the volume surrounding the sun .",
    "the primary registry for the known stars within 25 pc of the sun has been the catalogue of nearby stars , 3@xmath3 edition ( gliese & jahreise 1991 ) .",
    "recently , however , a comprehensive effort to compile information on virtually all stellar and sub - stellar sources within 20 pc of the sun has been jointly undertaken by nasa and nsf .",
    "this program , called nstars , which is an effort to support future nasa missions such as the space interferometry mission ( sim ) and the terrestrial planet finder , also has the scientific goals of understanding the stellar population near the sun and its evolutionary history .",
    "this population overwhelming consists of low luminosity stars which are difficult to study at great distances from the sun .",
    "a significant component of this local stellar population of low luminosity stars are white dwarfs .",
    "such white dwarf stars are currently of major interest for several reasons .",
    "first , they represent a history of star formation and stellar evolution in the galactic plane and the luminosity function of these stars can be used to place a lower limit on the age of the galactic disk ( liebert , dahn , monet 1988 , oswalt et al .",
    "second , white dwarfs , in particular the cooler stars , have been suggested as the origin of the macho lensing objects seen in lensing surveys ( kawaler 1996 , graff et al .",
    "third , estimates of the local density of white dwarfs are important to a full understanding of the mass density of the galactic plane ( bahcall 1984 ) .",
    "all methods of obtaining estimates of the space density of white dwarfs begin with a well defined observational sample and estimates of its completeness .",
    "one method is to obtain a magnitude limited sample of white dwarfs obtained from large color surveys such as the palomar - green survey ( green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) .",
    "a second method relies on a proper motion limited sample and uses the 1/v@xmath4 procedure of schmidt ( 1968 ) to correct for kinematic bias ( wood & oswalt 1998 ) .",
    "a third possibility is to use a volume limited sample of very high completeness .    in this paper",
    "we use the 4@xmath5 edition of the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs ( mccook & sion 1999 , hereafter ms99 ) to identify the known white dwarfs within a sphere of radius 20 pc around the sun .",
    "we have chosen the distance of 20 pc because it corresponds to the volume of the nstars database while also being a subset of the catalogue of nearby stars .",
    "as we shall see , this distance also contains the spherical volume in which the sample of known white dwarfs is reasonably complete .",
    "ms99 contains 2249 white dwarfs and nearly doubles the number of known degenerate stars compared to the previous version ( mccook & sion 1987 ) of the catalog .",
    "in addition to new stars , it contains a great amount of new information on previously identified stars , including spectral classification , updated photometric measurements , trigonometric parallaxes , absolute magnitudes , etc .",
    "the new ms99 catalog is therefore a valuable source for up - to - date information on the white dwarfs residing near the sun .    in  2.0",
    "we introduce the sample of the local population of white dwarfs . in  3.0 we discuss the distribution and completeness of this local sample .",
    "we also estimate the space density and mass density of white dwarfs and discuss the nature of the sample of white dwarfs near the sun .",
    "a preliminary version of this paper was presented at the nstars meeting in 1999 .",
    "using the search capabilities of the university of arizona white dwarf database , the ms99 catalog was searched for all degenerate stars having parallaxes @xmath6 @xmath7 0.05@xmath8 and for stars with photometric distances corresponding to v - m@xmath9 @xmath10 1.505 .",
    "the list of stars satisfying these two criteria was then examined and obvious anomalies such as feige 24 , a spectroscopic binary with a composite da + dme spectrum , were eliminated . the final list ( hereafter , the * _ local sample _ * ) consisted of 118 degenerate stars , including three double degenerate systems .",
    "this represents approximately 6% of the total ms99 catalog and 5% of the stars currently in the nstars database .",
    "the list of stars contained in the local sample is given in table 1 along with the ms99 spectral type , visual and absolute magnitudes , trigonometric parallaxes , photometric and trigonometric parallax distances , and the adopted distance for each star as well as an indication of the presence of any binary companions .",
    "there are 116 enteries in table 1 , two of the double degenerate systems ( wd 0727 + 482 and wd0135 - 052 ) are spectroscopic or unresolved visual binaries and are listed by system while the entry for wd0747 + 073 , a resolved visual binary , contains both components . in table 1",
    "stars which are included in ms99 are designated by their wd number , while stars not in ms99 are listed with alternate catalog names .    in establishing the final adopted distances in table 1 we have considered both trigonometric parallaxes and photometric parallaxes .",
    "the photometric data provided in ms99 , which attempts to report all available observations , is not homogeneous and is far from uniform in quality .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following scheme for using this data to obtain photometric distances .",
    "we use , wherever possible , the johnson @xmath11 , strmgren @xmath12 and the multichannel @xmath13 colors to estimate absolute @xmath14 magnitudes from the color magnitude relations employed by ms99 . for stars with multiple observations of these quantities , we have used an average of the available colors unless one or more of the observations was obviously discrepant or a redundant reporting of a prior observation .",
    "final absolute magnitudes , derived from the different color magnitude relations were also averaged . where there existed gross disagreement among the photometric absolute magnitudes , the issue was resolved by looking at other data such as effective temperatures and gravities or by the trigonometric parallax . for the apparent visual magnitudes , a similar averaging was used with the johnson @xmath14 magnitude assumed to be on the same scale as the strmgren @xmath15 magnitude .",
    "the multichannel magnitudes were not included unless no other sources of apparent magnitude were available . for the trigonometric parallaxes the following sources were used in order of preference ; _ hipparcos _ ( esa , 1997 ) values , van altena et al .",
    "( 1997 ) values , us naval observatory parallax program values or other values . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the trigonometric distances against the photometric distances for those stars possessing both estimates .",
    "the standard deviation about the 1:1 correlation line in fig .",
    "1 is 2.9 pc .",
    "this scatter is primarily due to the inherent uncertainty in the photometric distance estimates arising from color dependence due to stellar gravity and spectral type which is not contained in the color magnitude relations .    @ajaj    @jnl@aj=    @ptabletable @ptableconttable _continued _    @mkcaptionmakecaption##1##2 # # 1 + # # 21.5ex @mkcaptioncontmakecaption##1##2 # # 11.5ex    lccccccccc wd0000@xmath16345 & dc9 & 14.94 & 14.01 & 75.7 & 15.34 & 13.21 & 13.21 & wd0009@xmath17501 & da8 & 14.37 & 14.07 & 90.6 & 11.48 & 11.04 & 11.04 & wd0011@xmath16134 & dc8 & 15.88 & 14.53 & 51.3 & 18.60 & 19.5 & 19.5 & wd0034@xmath16211 & da7 & 14.43 & 13.83 & ..... & 11.69 & .... & 11.7 & b wd0038@xmath16226 & dc9 & 14.52 & 14.92 & 101.2 & 8.31 & 9.88 & 9.88 & wd0046@xmath17051 & dz7 & 12.39 & 14.09 & 226.95 & 4.58 & 4.41 & 4.41 & wd0115@xmath17159 & dq6 & 13.85 & 12.43 & 64.9 & 19.26 & 15.4 & 15.4 & wd0123@xmath16262 & dc7 & 15.00 & 13.08 & 54 .",

    "even with the 23% growth in the number of known white dwarfs in the local sample , many of the conclusions reached by jahreiss remain valid .",
    "a similar determination of the local sample has recently been made by tat & terzian ( 1999 , hereafter tt99 ) who compiled a list of white dwarfs within 20 pc , drawn principally from the prior version of the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs ( mccook & sion 1987 ) and the catalogue of nearby stars ( gliese & jarhiese 1991 ) .",
    "these authors , who where interested primarily in determining the distribution of ionization in the local interstellar medium , found 121 white dwarfs within 20 pc of the sun . in ",

    "in fig . 2 we show the distribution in celestial coordinates of the local sample on an equal area hammer - aitoff projection .",
    "there are no obvious zones with low densities of stars .",
    "there is , however , an apparent @xmath225:4 north - south asymmetry in the local sample . on the other hand , a calculation of the centroid of the local sample shows that it is displaced from the sun by a distance of only 1.4 pc in the direction of @xmath23 = 12.8@xmath18 and @xmath24 = + 0.5@xmath18 .",
    "this displacement should be compared with the expected standard deviation in the displacement of 118 uniformly distributed stars within 20 pc of the sun of 1.4 pc .",
    "alternately , the probability of finding hemispherical asymmetries in a binomial distribution of 118 objects which exceed 5:4 or are less than 4:5 is 0.23 , demonstrating that the asymmetry should not be considered significant .",
    "we discuss here the completeness of the local sample , in particular the completeness of the local sample out to a distance of 13 pc .",
    "first , we note the distance of 13 pc is close enough that we are not excluding many faint cool white dwarfs based on apparent brightness . due to the finite age of white dwarfs",
    ", the white dwarf luminosity function is truncated near absolute magnitudes of m@xmath9 = 16.2 so that at 13 pc the apparent magnitude of such stars are brighter than 17 .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted a cumulative log @xmath25 n - log ( distance ) distribution of the local sample . also shown in fig .",
    "3 is a line representing the expected number of white dwarfs assuming a constant local density of these stars .",
    "as can be seen , this assumption appears valid out to 13 pc , at which point the observed number falls below the expected number ; as anticipated if the local sample is incomplete beyond this distance .",
    "the completeness of the white dwarfs out to 13 pc is consistent with the earlier results of jahreiss ( 1987 ) , who also considered the number of white dwarfs within 20 pc of the sun from the 3@xmath3 catalogue of nearby stars , and by gleise , jahreiss , & upgren ( 1986 ) who came to the same conclusion for stars of all types in the 3@xmath3 catalogue of nearby stars .",
    "also dawson ( 1986 ) finds that the lhs proper motion catalog ( luyten 1976 ) is complete to 0.5@xmath8 yr@xmath26 , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath2213 pc .",
    "more recently , fleming ( 1998 ) also finds that the sample of known m dwarfs is also largely complete to within 13 pc .",
    "recently flynn et al . ( 2000 ) have suggested a relatively low completeness for the lhs , however , these claims are contradicted by the results of monet et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who specifically searched for high proper motion stars over looked by the lhs . from the relatively few such stars found , they confirm a relatively high completeness ( @xmath2290 % ) for the lhs .",
    "our subsequent determination of the local space and mass density of white dwarfs is derived exclusively from our 13 pc sub - sample .",
    "we can also estimate the overall completeness of the local sample . as noted above",
    ", the local sample appears complete out to 13 pc . within this volume",
    "we find a total of 51 white dwarfs . if we extrapolate the corresponding space density to a distance of 20 pc there ought to be approximately 186 white dwarfs within a distance of 20 pc compared to our observed number of 118 ,",
    "thus the local sample is approximately 63% complete out to 20 pc . from this",
    "it can be anticipated that another 60 to 70 white dwarfs remain to be discovered within 20 pc .",
    "the majority of these new stars will lie beyond 13 pc and be cool white dwarfs with visual magnitudes of 16 and 17 ; about 30% will be in binary systems .",
    "most of the 51 stars found within 13 pc have trigonometric parallaxes , however , 10 stars possess only photometric distance estimates .",
    "the question arises , what is the potential effect on the number of stars within 13 pc by including these photometric distances ?",
    "we have estimated this effect by using a monte carlo calculation in which the photometric distances are replaced by a random variable having a mean equal to the photometric distance and a standard deviation equal to 2.9 pc , which we obtain from the correlation between trigonometric and photometric distance in fig .",
    "the results of this calculation for 1000 trials is that the mean number stars with photometric distances less than 13 pc is 8.6 with a standard deviation of 2.5 .",
    "thus , the 10 stars with photometric distances less than 13 pc is consistent with this result .      using the local sample",
    "we can directly estimate the local space density of white dwarfs .",
    "assuming that the local sample of white dwarfs is complete out to a distance of 13 pc , we find a total of 51 white dwarfs .",
    "the local density of white dwarfs represented by the straight line in fig .",
    "3 corresponds to 5.5x10@xmath1pc@xmath1 .",
    "if we assume that the local sample is representative of the mean density of white dwarfs in the galactic plane near the sun , then the uncertainty in this value can be determined from the poisson variance of the number of stars within our 13 pc volume . assuming this estimate to be representative of the galactic plane near the sun , the mean number density becomes 5.5@xmath00.8x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 .",
    "the mass density due to white dwarfs can also be directly determined .",
    "approximately 75% of the stars in the local sample have published spectroscopic mass estimates .",
    "these estimates are contained primarily in bergeron , ruiz , & leggett ( 1997 , hereafter brl ) , leggett , ruiz , & bergeron ( 1998 ) and several other references .",
    "the average mass of the local sample stars with published masses is 0.64 m@xmath2 , somewhat larger than the value of @xmath220.57 m@xmath2 found from white dwarf mass distributions derived from spectroscopic studies of the general population of white dwarfs ( see finley et al . 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the average mass of the local sample is near the value of 0.67 m@xmath2 found by brl for their sample of cool white dwarfs . among the effects brl cite for this larger mass is the large fraction of non - da stars in their sample .",
    "it is also near the mean mass of 0.68 m@xmath2 obtained by silvestri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the sample of common proper motion visual binaries containing white dwarfs .",
    "in computing the mass density we have directly summed those stars with known masses and assigned the mean mass of the local sample to those stars with unknown masses .",
    "the corresponding mass density of white dwarfs in the local neighborhood is found to be 3.7@xmath00.5 x10@xmath1m@xmath2 pc@xmath1 , where the mass uncertainty corresponds to the uncertainty in the number density .",
    "this represents only 2% of the total dynamical mass density of 185@xmath020 x10@xmath1 m@xmath2pc@xmath1 determined by bachall ( 1984 ) .",
    "our white dwarf density can be compared with other recent published values of the white dwarf space density ( _ n@xmath27 _ ) which have been determined using a variety of methods and which have varied by a factor of 2 , ranging from 3.2 to 7.6 x10@xmath1pc@xmath1 .",
    "for example , sion & liebert ( 1977 ) found 23 white dwarfs within 10 pc and obtained a space density of 5.0 x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 .",
    "shipman ( 1983 ) considering white dwarfs in astrometric binary systems determined n@xmath27 = 4.6x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 while liebert , dahn & monet ( 1988 ) , using a 1/v@xmath4 method , found local space density for single white dwarfs to be 3.2 x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 .",
    "however , weideman ( 1991 ) who also considered the number of white dwarfs within 10 pc , revised the liebert et al .",
    "results to suggest a higher value of n@xmath27 = 5.0 x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 . more recently ,",
    "oswalt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using a 1/v@xmath4 method and estimating the completeness of their sample have estimated a total density of n@xmath27 = 7.6@xmath28x10@xmath1pc@xmath1 based on observations of a large number of wide binaries containing white dwarfs .",
    "leggett , ruiz & bergeron ( 1998 ) also using a 1/v@xmath4 technique find 3.39x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 and knox , hawkins , & hambly ( 1999 ) , using a southern hemisphere multi - color proper motion survey , estimate n@xmath29=4.16x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 from their `` best guess sample '' . finally , tt99 considering a number of white dwarfs within 15 pc find a value of n@xmath27 = 4.8x10@xmath1pc@xmath1 .",
    "their lower value of the space density is primarily a result of their estimate of 15pc for the completeness distance of the local sample .",
    "these authors compared the expected and observed numbers of white dwarfs at intervals of 5 pc and selected 15 pc as the completeness distance .",
    "if we use a value of 15 pc as our completeness distance then we would obtain n@xmath27 = 4.4 x10@xmath1 pc@xmath1 as a density of white dwarfs .",
    "the local sample possesses several advantages over previous estimates of the white dwarf density derived from other samples .",
    "the chief advantages are its completely volume - limited nature and relatively high level of apparent completeness .",
    "it does , however , suffer at present from a rather low sample size .",
    "this limitation , however , is likely to be diminished if the present zone of completeness is increased from 13 pc to 20 pc .",
    "we intend to do this part of the nstars program which is aimed at discovering and cataloging the stellar population within 20 pc of the sun .",
    "the primary statistical uncertainty in all present estimates of the space density of white dwarfs comes from the small sample size of typically @xmath2250 stars .",
    "wood & oswalt ( 1998 ) used monte carlo calculations to estimate that for sample sizes of n @xmath22 50 white dwarfs , uncertainties in n@xmath27 of @xmath2250% are expected .",
    "there also exists a modest systematic uncertainty due to the possibility that future searches and surveys may lead to the discovery of additional white dwarfs within 13 pc .",
    "the slight north - south asymmetry in the number of stars within 13 pc , hints at this possibility .",
    "thus , while it is possible that the future may bring a modest increase in the number of white dwarfs in this volume , it is highly unlikely , given the quality of the present distance estimates , that the number of known stars will significantly decrease .",
    "thus , our number and mass density estimates can be regarded as firm lower limits .",
    "the types of white dwarf stars which make up the local sample are also of interest .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that the population ratio of the two primary spectral types , the h - rich da stars and the non - da stars appears to undergo several changes as a function of effective temperature .",
    "that is , white dwarfs appear to change spectral classification based on the dominant atmospheric species as they cool .",
    "one of the most obvious manifestations of this is the decline in the da to non - da ratio . at temperatures of 20,000 k and above , this ratio reaches a value of 7:1 but declines to about 1:1 and lower for white dwarfs near 5,000 k to 4,000 k ( brl ) . in the local sample",
    "we find the da to non - da ratio to be 1.2 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there are few white dwarfs with t@xmath19 @xmath3020,000 k in the local sample . in this respect ,",
    "the local sample is quite similar to the population of cool white dwarfs studied by brl , leggett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and oswalt et al .",
    "indeed many stars in these studies , which are drawn heavily from the lhs catalogue ( luyten 1976 ) , are also present in the local sample .",
    "it is also similar to the results of sion & oswalt ( 1988 ) who found a da to non - da ratio of 1 across all spectral types and to that found for the silvestri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample .",
    "as indicated by table 2 , approximately 30% of the local sample of white dwarfs are members of binary systems .",
    "this includes 29 systems consisting of a white dwarf and one or more main sequence stars . in most instances",
    "the main sequence star is an m dwarf .",
    "the above estimate of the binary fraction follows directly from the number of known binaries in our sample and thus is , in effect , a lower limit to the true binary fraction .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct this estimate for the existence of possible unrecognized binary companions having low masses or small separations . in table 2",
