    "recently , several new studies analysing the distribution of extinction and dust in the galaxy have appeared , emphasising the importance of improving our understanding of this key component of the milky way galaxy .",
    "having moved on from the two - dimensional maps that can only characterise the total line of sight extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can now estimate extinction in three dimensions , utilising several large - scale photometric surveys to infer individual stellar parameters and distances to millions of stars .",
    "@xcite use red giant stars to map extinction using near infrared data from 2mass based on a galactic model .",
    "@xcite similarly compare colours of red clump stars to reference measurements in baade s window to obtain a high - resolution map of the central bulge .",
    "@xcite compare sdss and 2mass photometry to the spectral energy distribution from stellar templates , performing a @xmath9 fit to the data .",
    "analogously , @xcite analyse xstps - gac , 2mass and wise data on the galactic anti - centre .",
    "in recent years , several new methodological approaches have been introduced , in particular bayesian ones .",
    "@xcite uses our understanding of the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) to put a prior on the available stellar parameter space , and simultaneously infers extinction , effective temperature and distances to stars , based on broadband photometry and hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "@xcite expand this method to use sdss and ukidss data when parallaxes are absent and also to infer the extinction parameter at high galactic latitudes .",
    "@xcite use a hierarchical bayesian system developed in @xcite applied to iphas data to map extinction in the northern galactic plane .",
    "@xcite and @xcite combine galactic priors to obtain probabilistic three dimensional extinction estimates for most of the galaxy above declination @xmath10 degrees with pan - starrs1 data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite apply an inversion method to data from multiple surveys to map the local interstellar medium in particular .    in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated the method used in the present work on sdss and ukidss data of the galactic poles , finding good agreement with other studies . in this work we use pan - starrs1 @xcite and spitzer irac data from the glimpse ( _ galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire _ ) surveys @xcite to probe the inner few degrees of the galactic plane , thereby covering more diverse regions of extinction and its variation .",
    "this allows us to not only map the line - of - sight extinction but also to quantify the variation of the extinction parameter which characterises the properties and size distribution of dust grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we summarise the method used here , focussing on how we construct the maps presented later on . in section  [ sec :",
    "data ] we describe the surveys and data products we use to construct the map .",
    "results are presented in section  [ sec : extinctionmap ] , where we illustrate the performance and validity of our results .",
    "we close with a conclusion and discussion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , suggesting future steps and goals .",
    "the map data are available via the website .",
    "we outlined our bayesian approach to infer the astrophysical parameters ( aps ) of individual stars in @xcite .",
    "however , section 2.2 of that article may be a little confusing , as we used the absolute magnitude , @xmath11 , in the description , rather than @xmath12 ( which is the actual parameter ) , which we use as a proxy for distance modulus @xmath13 .",
    "this resulted in equation 5 being erroneous ( the implementation was correct ) .",
    "we use the same method here , but now provide a more accurate description .",
    "it generalises the method introduced by bailer - jones ( 2011 ) to include distance modulus via a proxy .",
    "we want to obtain the posterior distribution over the parameters given the data and assumptions .",
    "the parameters are the monochromatic extinction , @xmath14 , the effective temperature , @xmath15 , and the distance modulus , @xmath13 .",
    "( we will add to this the relative extinction , @xmath1 , later .",
    ") however , to avoid having to model the dependency of distance modulus on extinction , we instead actually infer @xmath16 . when reporting results we compute distance modulus as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is calculated as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "the data are the set of colours , the vector @xmath19 , and the apparent magnitude in one band , @xmath20 . and",
    "@xmath20 with the individual magnitudes , but it s methodologically preferable to separate out the spectral and distance information . ]",
    "@xmath21 stands for the hertzsprung  russell diagram , which introduces our prior knowledge of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "this is a two - dimensional probability distribution over @xmath22 , which we will specify in section  [ sec : data - hrd ] . using bayes theorem ,",
    "the posterior distribution can be written as the product of a likelihood and a prior ( multiplied by a normalisation constant @xmath23 ) @xmath24 using the law of joint probabilities , and the fact that @xmath19 is independent of @xmath20 , @xmath12 , and @xmath21 once conditioned on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we can write the likelihood as @xmath25 the second term can be written as a marginalisation over @xmath11 @xmath26 where conditional independence allows us to remove @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath21 from the first term under the integral . this is because @xmath27 , by definition .",
    "note that because @xmath20 and @xmath12 are measured  and therefore noisy  quantities , @xmath28 is not a delta function .",
    "we also removed @xmath14 and @xmath12 from the second term , because given the hrd and @xmath15 , the distribution over @xmath11 is fully defined .",
    "note that the right - hand - side no longer has any dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath20 is conditionally independent of @xmath14 because @xmath21 and @xmath15 specify a distribution over @xmath11 , which together with @xmath12 specifies a distribution over @xmath20 .",
    "finally , if the prior is separable such that we can write @xmath29 then substituting equations [ eqn : bayes2 ] , [ eqn : bayes3 ] and [ eqn : bayes4 ] into [ eqn : bayes1 ] gives @xmath30 this expression is the product of three terms .",
    "the first is the probability of measuring the colours given the relevant parameters .",
    "the second is the prior over extinction and @xmath12 .",
    "the third is an integral over the unknown absolute magnitude , constrained by the hrd and the relationship between @xmath20 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we can generalise the equation to include @xmath1 by simply replacing @xmath14 with @xmath31 .    for @xmath14 and @xmath1",
    "we adopt uniform priors over the parameter ranges we explore and zero outside . in practice",
    "we only process results further which have estimated aps in the ranges from @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath8 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this is by design , as our hrd prior limits the effective temperature range and @xmath1 is not expected to exceed the extreme values of the above range .",
    "although we do not explicitly limit the range of @xmath0 during the inference , in practice we flag any stars that have an estimated @xmath0 above approximately seven magnitudes , as these stars tend not to fit into our model and we therefore do not trust the inferences .",
    "this is typically the case when one or several estimated aps lie at the boundaries of their respective parameter range ( which is @xmath34 for @xmath14 ) . in any case , due to the brightness limits of the surveys and",
    "the use of optical photometry , we do not expect to find many stars at very high extinctions and also do nt expect to be able to estimate their parameters accurately . for @xmath12 , we also adopt a uniform prior .      in the model we use the monochromatic extinction @xmath14 , which only depends on properties of the interstellar medium along the line of sight .",
    "other parameterisations are functions of the star s spectral energy distribution ( _ sed _ ) and therefore depend on the effective temperature .",
    "we use the extinction curves from @xcite , which allow us to vary the extinction parameter @xmath1 , which is equivalent to @xmath35 in that formulation .",
    "we use the same definition of extinction and the extinction parameter as in @xcite .",
    "we build a synthetic forward model based on marcs model spectra @xcite in the temperature range @xmath36 .",
    "based on the bandpass functions of the survey filters , we compute the absolute photometry for stars with simulated extinction .",
    "the zero points are computed in the ab system .",
    "we convert the spitzer irac data ( which is reported in vega magnitudes ) accordingly .    as",
    "the synthetic libraries do not model colours of m dwarfs well , we combine these with empirical stellar loci for the pan - starrs1 bands from @xcite and adapt the synthetic loci at low temperatures ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "synthetic and empirical loci match very well for other spectral types .",
    "for each colour we fit a three - dimensional thin - plate spline to its variation over @xmath14 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "these spline models are used to predict the colour for given trial aps , which are compared with the measured colours via the likelihood in equation  [ eqn : bayes1 ] .",
    "to fully model all variations over small parameter changes , we use @xmath38 synthetic stars and allow the splines to have @xmath39 degrees of freedom .",
    "we use a metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine to sample the parameter space in logarithmic units of the aps . using the logarithm forces them to remain positive without the use of an explicit prior to this effect .",
    "sufficient convergence is achieved with @xmath40 steps each for burn - in and sampling .",
    "the sampling steps are of the order of @xmath41 in all variables .",
    "to speed up the computation time , we use a lookup table for all parameters .",
    "this has a resolution much better than the model accuracy in order to avoid biasing the results from grid effects .",
    "after inferring parameters for all stars , we remove those with parameters at the grid boundaries , resulting in ranges of @xmath42 in @xmath8 and @xmath43 in @xmath1 .",
    "this post - processing step removes close to @xmath44 of the stars . in the available dataset",
    "these stars have an indicator flag set to @xmath45 for each affected ap ( see appendix  [ app : data ] ) .",
    "our extinction map is based on pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) and spitzer photometry .",
    "we crossmatch ps1 and spitzer irac @xmath46 point source data from the glimpse surveys using the api of the cross - match service provided by cds , strasbourg with a @xmath47 search radius .",
    "this results in a data set with @xmath48 stars .",
    "details on the surveys and data selection are noted below .      the pan - starrs1 survey has observed the entire sky north of declination @xmath49 in five filters @xcite .",
    "these cover the wavelength range @xmath50 . the resulting global photometric calibration is better than @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we select all point sources classified as stars that have good observations in the five bands , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , using the epoch - averaged photometry in each band .",
    "we use data collected up to february 2013 .",
    "we do not take into account any variability observed across multiple epochs .",
    "@xmath57 of stars have @xmath52-band magnitudes between @xmath58 .",
    "only a tiny fraction of the stars have photometric uncertainties worse than @xmath59 , the median uncertainties in the five bands are in the range @xmath60 .",
    "the spitzer space telescope legacy program glimpse consists of four separate surveys ( i , ii , 3d , 360 ) , which together cover most of the galactic plane within a few degrees in latitude .",
    "the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is used to image at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "we use only the @xmath65 data , as the longer wavelength measurements do not improve our parameter estimation .",
    "we select point sources that have signal to noise ratios greater than @xmath66 and closed source flags ( ` csf ` ) of @xmath67 , indicating that no other sources are within @xmath68 of a source .",
    "this is to ensure that sources are extracted reliably .",
    "the @xmath57 quantile for @xmath65-band magnitudes is @xmath69 .      as in @xcite",
    ", we use a hrd prior as a constraint in the @xmath70 -plane . to fully account for the distribution in stellar types expected in the galactic plane , in particular k and m dwarfs , as well as giants",
    ", we use the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite . for fixed solar metallicity",
    ", we smooth the data in the hrd plane using a binned kernel density estimate with bandwidths of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xmath8 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the temperature range is from @xmath74 , the absolute magnitudes vary from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting grid has the pixel dimensions of @xmath77 ( as @xmath78 ) . before normalisation ,",
    "a small , non - negative offset is added to all pixels to account for the fact that the regions that are empty in the dartmouth model hrd in reality may not have exactly zero probability .",
    "we show a representation of the hrd in figure  [ fig : data - hrd ] .",
    "the hrd of course depends on the metallicity , and as demonstrated in @xcite the choice affects the results .",
    "unsurprisingly , it is not possible to also estimate metallicity from our photometric data ( due in part to the large - a priori unknown - range of @xmath8 and @xmath14 in the data ) .",
    "if we fixed the metallicity of the hrd to a single value , we would obtain artificially precise ( but not necessarily more accurate ) results for the inferred parameters . to avoid this",
    ", we took an hrd and then smoothed it ( using a kernel density estimation method ) .",
    "this produces a smooth but conservatively broad hrd ; it is broader than the one used in @xcite . as demonstrated in that paper , the lack of a metallicity determination will be the main limiting factor on the distance accuracy , while the extinction , extinction parameter , and effective temperature are less influenced by this .",
    "we make this compromise of a simple hrd as we do not wish to introduce yet more dependencies by imposing a complex galaxy model .",
    "logarithm of the density , dark red is high number density and light yellow is low .",
    "light yellow areas denote regions of the parameter space with initially zero probability .",
    "a small offset is added to each point before normalisation to avoid this in the actual computation . in this case",
    "the offset is approximately @xmath79 times the maximum density , resulting in a value of @xmath80 in logarithmic density . ]",
    "we apply our method to the cross - matched ps1-glimpse photometry to obtain individual ap estimates for all stars individually . to summarise and visualise these results we bin stars with a fixed angular resolution of @xmath6 in @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we present the maps after converting the extinction values to the @xmath83-band extinction @xmath84 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details of this conversion ) . to compute the variation in extinction @xmath18 ( and @xmath1 ) along the line - of - sight at any value of distance modulus",
    "@xmath85 we calculate the weighted mean extinction @xmath86 and standard deviation @xmath87 ( and analogously for @xmath1 ) for all stars in a single bin which have a distance modulus estimate within one magnitude of our selected position .",
    "these are @xmath88 where the sums are over @xmath89 .",
    "the weight @xmath90 is a measure of the difference between the inferred stellar distance modulus @xmath91 and the cell distance @xmath85 .",
    "the confidence intervals about the mode are not symmetric , so we use a split gaussian to approximate the distribution they describe . for each star",
    "we compute the weight using the asymmetric gaussian ( or split normal distribution ) , parameterised by the mode and the standard deviations , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , of each half of the gaussian : @xmath94 in the case when @xmath91 is smaller than @xmath85 then @xmath95 , otherwise @xmath96 .",
    "this is a convenient and fast substitute for summing over all the 2d pdfs we obtain from the inference .",
    "stars with small confidence intervals are weighted more strongly than those with large ones .",
    "this procedure can be applied to any arbitrary distance modulus step @xmath85 .",
    "this is repeated for every angular bin to construct a full three dimensional representation of the cumulative line - of - sight extinction .",
    "analogously we use the same procedure with the extinction parameter @xmath1 , allowing us not only to follow the extinction variation along the line of sight , but also to look at the properties of the dust . due to the selection process , it is in principle possible that individual stars appear in two consecutive distance bins , indicating that this measure is similar to a running ( weighted ) mean .",
    "for each cell we require at least @xmath97 stars to compute the result .",
    "we use distance modulus as the distance variable because it straightforwardly captures the uncertainty which increases with distance .",
    "for example , the relative error in distance for a distance modulus error of @xmath98 at @xmath99 is @xmath100 , whereas at @xmath101 it increases to @xmath102 .",
    "it is important to note that although the uncertainty in @xmath13 may be symmetric , it will not be in @xmath103 .    the mean uncertainties on extinction @xmath0 , extinction parameter @xmath1 , effective temperature @xmath8 and distance modulus @xmath13 , based on the widths of the @xmath104 confidence intervals of the individual stellar parameter estimates , are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "for each star we obtain an entire pdf over the parameters , from which we compute the confidence intervals .",
    "the lower bound of the @xmath104 confidence interval has @xmath109 of the probability below it , whereas the upper bound has @xmath109 of the probability above it .",
    "histograms of the uncertainty distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : data - errhist ] .",
    "confidence intervals of extinction @xmath14 , extinction parameter @xmath1 , effective temperature @xmath8 and distance modulus @xmath13 .",
    "the purple vertical lines indicate the mean values in each case . for @xmath14",

    "these are computed by dividing the width of the @xmath111 per cent confidence intervals by the mean .",
    "the mean relative uncertainties are @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for extinction , extinction parameter and effective temperature , respectively .",
    "confidence intervals divided by mean for @xmath14 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",

    "note that this does not indicate directly how many stars are used at each distance slice .",
    "we impose minimal requirements in this case ( see above ) .",
    "the mean density is nearly @xmath115 stars per @xmath6 pixel , whereby some pixels have only a few stars ( not counting regions not covered by the data set ) .",
    "the maximum is @xmath116 , the most dense pixels tend to be situated slightly above and below @xmath117 around the galactic centre .",
    "as expected the density decreases as we move away from the galactic centre in longitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : extinctionmap - ar ] shows the cumulative line of sight extinction for eight distance slices from @xmath118 in units of @xmath53 -band extinction as two - dimensional slices of the full map through the galactic plane .",
    "various structures are visible .",
    "in particular the lack of higher extinctions between @xmath119 and towards larger distances coincides with the warp in the dust distribution noted by @xcite and @xcite . in section  [ sec : extinctionmap - validation ] we will analyse in more detail a few particular molecular clouds , which we will also use to validate the overall method .        at closer distances",
    "some cells contain insufficient stars to be assigned an extinction estimate and therefore appear white .",
    "the colour scale is limited to @xmath18 @xmath120 ; the highest extinction estimate for any pixel is @xmath18@xmath121 , although individual stellar estimates may be larger .",
    "based on the distribution of the standard deviation of individual stellar distances within the three dimensional cells and the standard error of the mean in each cell ( per angle and distance , for which a summary is shown in figure  [ fig : stderror ] ) , we estimate that distances are only reliable from @xmath122 . at closer distances",
    "we observe few to no stars due to the bright magnitude limits of the surveys . beyond the upper limit ,",
    "distance uncertainties become very large and the distance estimates themselves are no longer useful ( see the relation between distance modulus and distance uncertainties above ) .",
    "those distance slices are not presented here ( although the individual stellar distances are available in our published data set ) .",
    "the predicted uncertainty is illustrated by the distribution of the model - predicted standard errors in the distance modulus and is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : stderror ] .",

    "the distribution over all cells of the standard deviation of distance moduli within each cell is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : stderror ] .",

    "as a reference , a distance modulus of @xmath129 ( @xmath34 ) is equivalent to a distance of @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "here we can clearly see the @xmath7 length of the distance modulus slices as well as the expected increase of extinction within a few @xmath132 towards the galactic centre at the top of the figure . as the measured extinction in neighbouring cells",
    "are only correlated in the radial direction , but not in longitude ( or latitude ) , many discontinuities can be seen .          as mentioned in section  [",

    "this again has to do with model uncertainties and parameter degeneracies that we are unable to remove .",
    "both extinction and the extinction parameter are cumulative along the line of sight to any given distance .",
    "all the dust along the line of sight contributes to any individual estimate . because of this ,",
    "correlations between these two cumulative parameters are harder to see : at larger distances , the length scale over which the dust properties are averaged increases . for both the @xmath14 and @xmath1 estimates we use only stars in a limited distance range around the specified distance .",

    "the dashed vertical lines indicate the distances reported in @xcite . ]    similarly , in figure  [ fig : extinctionmap - validation - profiles - diff ] we show differential profiles of @xmath18 ( magenta circles ) and @xmath1 ( green triangles ) , where the values quantify the change in both parameters in steps of @xmath165 .    despite not explicitly measuring distances to individual objects ,",
    "it is clear that our method manages to capture real features in the extinction distribution .",
    "we see that the total extinction @xmath18 generally increases around the inferred positions of the clouds , indicating an increase of the underlying dust density around that position .",
    "this feature is more pronounced in the two top panels , although the clouds could be responsible for the more gradual increase in extinction in the other two panels as well .",
    "this is highlighted in figure  [ fig : extinctionmap - validation - profiles - diff ] , where the increase in extinction can be seen more clearly in the top two panels .",
    "the interpretation of the bottom two panels in both figures is less clear cut , decspite there being marginal changes in @xmath18 and @xmath1 around the literature distances of the clouds .",
    "however , the spread in @xmath18 ( and @xmath1 ) is generally quite large , and the distances are so uncertain that we are not necessarily confident of having detected the clouds . in all four panels the mean extinction decreases slightly again beyond @xmath166 .",
    "we do not trust values beyond this distance ( see section  [ sec : extinctionmap - ar ] and figure  [ fig : stderror ] for details ) , as we do not expect to detect many stars at large distances due to the faint magnitude limits of the input catalogues and the resulting selection effects .",
    "the value of the extinction parameter @xmath1 also appears to increase in sync with the increase of extinction , although the magnitude of variation tends to be within the range of uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , the overall picture is one where there are dense dust clouds which cause the cumulative line of sight extinction to increase above some foreground value .",
    "this suggests that the inferred parameters we obtain with our method are trustworthy and physically plausible , at least on a relative scale .    to further probe this",
    ", we compare our results with those of @xcite ( b12 ) who combine sdss and 2mass data to calculate @xmath18 and @xmath35 using a straight - forward fit to stellar templates .",
    "we take a subset of the common survey area from @xmath167 and @xmath168 to @xmath169 and compute a 3d dust map based on their results using equation  [ eq : extinctionmap - weightedmean ] . due to the different sensitivities and depths of the surveys we use the distance slices at @xmath170 and @xmath171 for further comparison , as other distances have many empty cells in one or both data sets .",
    "qualitatively we find similar behaviour and features in the @xmath18 extinction map , although the average extinction in our data is @xmath172 , whereas the b12 data suggests an average of @xmath173 .",
    "the standard deviations are similar in both cases . for the extinction parameter @xmath1",
    "we obtain an average value of @xmath174 with a standard deviation of @xmath175 , whereas @xmath176 ( standard deviation is also @xmath175 . ) these differences are also reflected when individually cross - matching the stars in the common footprint .",
    "the differences ( this work minus b12 ) on average are @xmath177 for @xmath83-band extinction and @xmath178 for the extinction parameter . as expected , due to b12 s work strongly favouring a value of @xmath145 for a large fraction of stars , we measure a standard deviation of @xmath179 in @xmath1 between the two datasets and see that the differences increase as our @xmath1 estimates increase .",
    "our extinction results agree reasonably well with the previous work .",
    "however , we seem to have systematically higher values of @xmath1 , which , as discussed previously , may result from fixing the metallicity in the hrd and/or using synthetic spectral templates . nevertheless , we are much more confident in our relative values of the extinction parameter ( and @xmath14 ) , as our model assumptions have much less effect on our ability to measure these .    to exclude the possibility that requiring nir data could be a cause for the aforementioned differences , we select a random sample of @xmath40 stars in the same region based purely on their presence in the ps1 data - set .",
    "we require no counterpart in the glimpse surveys . comparing the average widths of the @xmath104 confidence intervals and the average relative uncertainties with results that include glimpse data , as shown in table [ tab : ps1comp ]",
    ", we find that including the @xmath46 photometry significantly improves the precision of the inferred aps .",
    "especially the @xmath1 estimates benefit from the additional band , reducing the average width of the confidence intervals from @xmath180 to @xmath181 .",
