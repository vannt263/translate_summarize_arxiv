    "in this report , recent theoretical results on tmd pdfs are presented , giving particular emphasis on their renormalization - group properties in conjunction with local color - gauge invariance .",
    "the latter is ensured by the presence of wilson lines ( gauge links ) that are required to obtain gauge - invariant definitions of pdfs , integrated over the parton transverse momentum , and also unintegrated , i.e. , tmd pdfs ( see , for reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these quantities encapsulate the nonperturbative parts of the qcd processes , being themselves universal , with a ( large ) momentum - scale dependence controlled by perturbative qcd in the form of renormalization - group type evolution equations , like the dokshitzer  gribov ",
    "parisi ) ( dglap ) evolution equation .",
    "central to the solution of these equations is the knowledge of the appropriate anomalous dimensions , calculable within perturbative qcd .",
    "one of the main purposes of this presentation is to discuss the physical impact of the leading - order anomalous dimensions in the light - cone gauge of matrix elements containing local operators and path - ordered exponentials along gauge contours that comprise transverse segments extending to light - cone infinity .",
    "the particular relevance of the anomalous dimensions originates from the fact that , in contrast to the gauge links which are path - dependent , they are local objects and ensure the gauge invariance of contour - dependent operators in terms of `` logarithmic '' , i.e. , additive , ward - takahashi / slavnov - taylor identities . because the anomalous dimensions of such operators ensue from obstructions , like endpoints , cusps , or self - intersections , one is able to analyze the renormalization - group properties of tmd pdfs solely by means of these quantities without any reference to the explicit , in general complicated , gauge - link structure .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the inclusion of transverse gauge links at light - cone infinity is indispensable for the restoration of full gauge invariance of the tmd pdfs in the light - cone gauge .",
    "otherwise the gauge freedom in the light - cone gauge is not completely exhausted and , therefore , the light cone gauge is insufficient to trivialize the interaction of the struck quark with the gluon field of the spectators .",
    "moreover , the transverse gauge link is responsible for the final ( initial ) state interactions .",
    "we begin with the operator definition of the tmd distribution of a quark with momentum @xmath1 in a quark with momentum @xmath2 , with decomposed gauge contours going through light - cone infinity : @xmath3^\\dagger \\right.\\\\ & \\times [ \\infty^- , \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\xi_\\perp$ } ;     \\left .",

    "taking into account the hermitian conjugate contributions , we have identified an uv - divergent contribution that is absent in covariant gauges ( e.g. , the feynman gauge ) and can be conceived as originating from a non - trivial cusp - like junction point of the individual ( transverse ) gauge contours in the tmd pdf . referring for details to @xcite",
