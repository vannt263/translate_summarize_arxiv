    "the study of layered ising models ( i m s ) has been an active field of research during the last decades .",
    "one may mention the pioneering works on two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodically@xcite and randomly@xcite layered lattices .",
    "similarly the critical behavior of directed walks ( dw s ) in inhomogeneous@xcite or random media@xcite has attracted widespread interest .",
    "recently , following the discovery of quasicrystals,@xcite on the one hand , and the progress in molecular beam epitaxy which allows the production of good quality multilayers , on the other hand,@xcite there has been a growing interest in the theoretical study of phase transitions in quasiperiodic systems and , more generally , aperiodic systems.@xcite these are deterministic but nonperiodic structures which are called quasiperiodic when the spatial fluctuations are so weak that the fourier spectrum is still discrete , but point symmetry is incompatible with a periodic structure .",
    "such systems may be considered as intermediates between homogeneous and random ones and , consequently , are expected to display a rich variety of critical behaviors .",
    "most of the early works about phase transitions on aperiodic systems were done on quasiperiodic lattices and did not show any sign of modified critical behavior . among these , one may mention an approximate renormalization group treatment of the classical i m on the penrose lattice@xcite and monte carlo renormalization group studies of the same problem@xcite.@xcite universal behavior was also obtained in monte carlo simulations of the percolation problem on the penrose lattice and its dual@xcite as well as for the statistics of self - avoiding walks.@xcite one may notice , as an exception , the analytical renormalization group study of interfacial roughness , still on the penrose lattice , where the fluctuating interface  feels \" a fibonacci quasiperiodic potential . in this case ,",
    "a marginal behavior was obtained for the decay of the transverse correlations.@xcite    probably the most studied system is the aperiodically layered 2d classical i m and its quantum counterpart in the extreme anisotropic limit,@xcite the aperiodic ising quantum chain in a transverse field .    in the classical formulation ,",
    "the energy of a configuration is given by @xmath0 where the @xmath1 s are the spin-@xmath2 ising variables , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the exchange interactions in the vertical and horizontal directions , respectively .",
    "their values are the same in a vertical layer @xmath5 and are modulated according to some aperiodic sequence in the horizontal direction .    in the extreme anisotropic limit ( @xmath6 )",
    ", the transfer matrix between successive rows in the vertical direction can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the infinitesimal lattice spacing in the euclidian time direction .",
    "@xmath9 is the hamiltonian of a spin-@xmath2 quantum ising chain in a transverse field : @xmath10 where the @xmath11 s are pauli spin matrices .",
    "the transverse field @xmath12 * ( * such that @xmath13 is the dual coupling @xmath14 given by @xmath15\\!=\\!\\tanh k_1(k)$ ] * ) * plays the role of the temperature . the coupling @xmath16 is the ratio @xmath17 . in general ,",
    "due to universality , the classical and quantum systems have the same critical properties . only in the presence of a marginal perturbation which leads to nonuniversal exponents are the corresponding quantum exponents obtained by taking an appropriate limit of the classical expressions .",
    "usually the aperiodic modulation is assumed to involve only the horizontal couplings , i.e. , the two - spin interaction @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "the fluctuation around the average @xmath19 at a length scale @xmath20 is measured by @xmath21 when the aperiodic couplings are generated via substitutions using an inflation rule , this quantity behaves as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the wandering exponent of the aperiodic sequence wich is linked to the two leading eigenvalues of a substitution matrix.@xcite    for sequences with bounded fluctuations ( @xmath24 ) the aperiodic perturbation does not change the ising critical behavior .",
    "this was shown analytically by tracy in the case of the fibonacci sequence , with @xmath25 , for the 2d layered i m .",
    "the onsager logarithmic singularity of the specific heat then keeps a nonvanishing finite amplitude.@xcite the same conclusion was reached for the ising quantum chain with generalized fibonacci modulations of the couplings.@xcite the low - energy spectrum of the quantum chain which , through the gap - exponent relation on finite critical chains , gives the values of the critical exponents was shown to be unaffected by a quasiperiodic modulation.@xcite universal behavior was also obtained with the thue - morse sequence and its generalizations.@xcite in this case , the quantum chain is not quasiperiodic but the fluctations remain bounded .",
    "for an aperiodic sequence with unbounded fluctuations ( @xmath26 ) , tracy@xcite noticed that the onsager singularity is suppressed like in the randomly layered mccoy - wu model.@xcite    the situation was later clarified by luck@xcite who proposed a generalization of the harris criterion for quenched randomness@xcite adapted to the case of aperiodic fluctuations of the couplings ( see also ref .  ) . by comparing the mean shift of the local temperature in the 2d layered system ( governed by the wandering exponent @xmath23 ) , at the scale of the correlation length of the unperturbed system , to the deviation from the critical temperature , one obtains a crossover exponent @xmath27 .",
    "it controls the evolution of the amplitude of the aperiodic modulation when one approaches the critical point . for the 2d i m with @xmath28 , the crossover exponent is equal to the wandering exponent",
    "so that , quite generally , the aperiodic modulation becomes a relevant perturbation and changes the ising critical behavior when the fluctuations are unbounded , as conjectured by benza _",
    "et al_.@xcite one must notice that the correspondence between relevant perturbations and unbounded fluctuations holds only when @xmath28 .",
    "the marginal behavior obtained for the fibonacci sequence with bounded fluctuations in the case of the interface roughness problem@xcite follows from luck s criterion where @xmath29 is now the correlation length exponent in the transverse direction @xmath30 .",
    "finally let us mention that for a randomly layered system the relevance - irrelevance criterion applies with @xmath31",
    ".    in the same work,@xcite luck checked the validity of his critierion for random and aperiodic quantum ising chains .",
    "to treat the aperiodic problem he considers periodic approximants , i.e. , a periodic quantum chain with a large unit cell of length @xmath20 in which the couplings @xmath16 are distributed according to the aperiodic sequence .",
    "he deduces the low - energy behavior of the fermionic excitations@xcite @xmath32 from a perturbation expansion in @xmath32 . for the unperturbed problem at criticality ,",
    "the massless excitations have a linear low - energy dispersion relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the velocity and @xmath35 the wave vector . on the periodic approximant a @xmath20-dependent velocity @xmath36",
    "is obtained and the properties of the aperiodic system are governed by the limiting behavior of @xmath36 when @xmath20 goes to infinity .",
    "the behavior of the singular part of the ground - state energy , corresponding to the free energy in the 2d classical system , is linked to the low - energy excitation spectrum and its temperature dependence can be obtained through a scaling argument .    for sequences with bounded fluctuations ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath36 is bounded and nonvanishing in the limit @xmath37 so that the onsager logarithmic critical singularity is preserved . for unbounded fluctuations ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the typical velocity vanishes exponentially , leading to an essential singularity for the singular part of the ground - state energy as in the case of random chains . finally , when the fluctuations grow on a logarithmic scale ( @xmath38 )",
    ", the typical velocity vanishes as a nonuniversal power of @xmath20 .",
    "the perturbation is marginal and the specific heat exponent is negative ( the logarithmic singularity is suppressed ) and varies continuously with the amplitude of the aperiodic modulation .",
    "this marginal behavior was checked numerically .",
    "the results obtained so far for different aperiodic modulations in different models are all in accordance with luck s criterion .. most of the activity in our groups was concerned with the study of the surface and bulk critical properties of 2d aperiodically layered i m s , either using the 1d quantum formulation or working on a triangular lattice , making use of the star - triangle relation .    although some relevant perturbations were treated in refs .   and  , we mainly considered marginal aperiodic perturbations .",
    "the continuously varying surface magnetic exponent @xmath39 was obtained analytically for different aperiodic sequences whereas the scaling dimension of the surface energy was conjectured on the basis of finite - size scaling studies.@xcite    the marginal aperiodic models were found to display anisotropic scaling . @xcite the correlation length diverges with different exponents along and through the layers with a ratio @xmath40 , giving a continuously varying anisotropy exponent .",
    "such a behavior was in fact implicitly contained in luck s work@xcite where a power - law dependence on @xmath20 was found in the marginal case .",
    "accurate numerical calculations of the anisotropy exponent @xmath41 led us to propose a simple scaling relation between @xmath41 and the surface magnetic exponents on both sides of the system , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the anisotropic scaling of bulk and surface properties was extensively studied in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an exact renormalization - group ( rg ) study of aperiodic and hierarchical ising and dw models .",
    "the introduction of rg techniques into the field of phase transitions and critical phenomena has largely contributed to our understanding of the properties of the critical state .",
    "for instance , the rg method has given a natural explanation for the scaling hypothesis and universality .",
    "at the same time , it has provided powerful procedures to calculate critical exponents,@xcite albeit generally using some approximation , e.g. , approximate rg transformations , expansions in a small parameter ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , or numerical methods .",
    "there are few nontrivial problems in statistical mechanics for which the rg transformation can be worked out exactly .",
    "one may mention the i m on the triangular lattice@xcite or different physical processes on self - similar fractal objects.@xcite    here we develop exact rg solutions for a class of 2d layered ising and dw models .",
    "the novel feature of our approach is that we study both problems within the framework of the same rg transformation .",
    "it is based on a hitherto unnoticed connection between the eigenvalue problem for fermionic excitations which enters the solution of the i m ( ref .  ) and the transfer matrix of a dw in two dimensions .",
    "both problems are considered on layered lattices , such that the walk is directed along the translationally invariant direction .",
    "the solution of the dw , which means the diagonalization of its transfer matrix ( tm ) , provides in principle all the necessary information to obtain the zero - field thermodynamical properties and correlation functions of the i m .",
    "the critical properties of the two models are connected to the scaling behavior of the eigenstates of the tm at different edges of the spectrum .",
    "an exact rg study of the eigenvalue problem of the tm is performed for different self - similar distributions of the couplings and _ the critical properties of the i m and the dw are governed by two different fixed points of the same rg transformation_.    our method is well adapted to the case of self - similar perturbations .",
    "it is quite different from the approximate renormalization group technique recently introduced by fisher to treat randomly layered systems.@xcite in this approach , which leads to exact results in the critical domain , instead of using the transformation to fermions , fischer works on the hamiltonian itself , reducing the energy scale of the problem by a systematic elimination of the stronger couplings    the bulk and surface critical properties are examined for several aperiodic and hierarchical sequences . in all of the models we studied the aperiodicity is marginal at the ising fixed point and induces continuously varying critical exponents .",
    "the bulk anisotropy exponent @xmath41 and the correlation length exponents @xmath29 , on the one hand , and the surface energy exponent @xmath46 and the surface magnetization exponents @xmath42 and @xmath43 , on the other hand , are obtained analytically .",
    "we also prove the previously conjectured relation between the anisotropy and surface magnetic exponents , @xmath47 , which holds for sequences which modify the critical coupling .",
    "a simple scaling picture emerges in which the surface magnetic exponents play a fundamental role : all the nonuniversal exponents ( except the bulk magnetic one , not considered in this work ) can be expressed as functions of these two surface magnetic exponents .",
    "the surface energy exponent is given by @xmath48 on one side of the chain and @xmath49 on the other , whereas the specific heat exponent is given by @xmath50 .",
    "with aperiodic sequences with a vanishing density of modified couplings , which changes the critical behavior only locally near the surface , there is no anisotropy in the bulk of the system ( @xmath51 ) . for sufficiently strong modified couplings ,",
    "the surface remains ordered at the bulk critical point and then the first excitation alone scales in an anomalous way , with a continuously varying power of the size of the system .    finally one may mention that these marginal aperiodic ising sytems are closer to periodic than to randomly layered ones .",
    "the varying exponents evolve continuously from their unperturbed values when the aperiodic modulation grows .",
    "in particular we checked numerically that the gap is nonvanishing in the disordered phase , i.e. , that there is no trace of a griffiths phase,@xcite as expected for systems with bounded fluctuations.@xcite even with relevant aperiodic perturbations , which by some aspects are closer to random ones , displaying essential singularities in the singular part of the ground - state energy@xcite and in the surface magnetization,@xcite the griffiths phase is absent according to a recent study.@xcite    a short account of our results , concerning the bulk critical behavior , has been given in a recent letter.@xcite    the structure of the paper is the following .",

    "using a jordan - wigner transformation,@xcite the ising hamiltonian ( [ int.2 ] ) can be rewritten as a quadratic form in fermion operators .",
    "it is then diagonalized through a canonical transformation@xcite which gives @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are fermion creation and anihilation operators , respectively .",
