    "the magnetic properties of nanoparticles , thin films and wires have attracted recently a lot of attention due to their potential technological applications .",
    "it is thus very important to investigate the influence of dimensionality on these properties . in many experimental systems ,",
    "some atoms are in a bulk - like environment while some others have a very low coordinence in a strongly asymmetric environment .",
    "this is the case of clusters , at the edge of adsorbed islands , supported wires , along step edges or in the nanoconstriction region of a break junction etc .. as a consequence the magnetic properties of such systems need to be treated at an atomic level , by studying their electronic structure in the framework of quantum mechanics .    in principle",
    "these properties can be determined from ab - initio calculations .",
    "however the computer time and storage increase drastically with the number of inequivalent atoms .",
    "thus there is a need for simplified methods still based on quantum mechanics which capture the essential physics . in this context tight - binding ( tb ) methods",
    "are ideally suited for these calculations .",
    "indeed tb methods can be extended to magnetic systems by introducing hubbard two - body terms treated in the hartree - fock approximation @xcite , and can easily include spin - orbit effects@xcite .",
    "moreover they allow the calculation of local physical quantities ( spin or orbital moment etc .. ) in a straightforward manner which gives a physically transparent understanding of the phenomena .",
    "the anisotropy of the magneto - crystalline energy ( mae ) , although small in transition metals , is of fundamental importance since it determines the easy magnetization axis .",
    "the mae results from the coupling of the spin and orbital moments . in the bulk",
    "it is well known that the orbital moment is nearly quenched due to the high symmetry of the potential . when dimensionality or symmetry is reduced",
    "the orbital moment is less and less quenched and the mae increases rapidly .",
    "the mae is routinely measured by magnetic hysteresis or torque measurements@xcite , for instance . more recently",
    "the development of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism techniques has allowed the experimental determination of the orbital moment@xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "the calculation of the mae in bulk pure ferromagnetic transition metals is a challenge because of its minuteness ( typically some @xmath5ev ) .",
    "the first attempts to determine the mae on surfaces have been performed on free standing mono - layers either using a perturbative treatment of the spin - orbit coupling in a tight - binding model@xcite , or with self - consistent ab - initio technique@xcite .",
    "the calculations performed by bruno @xcite on mono - layers have been extended to study slabs with several atomic layers@xcite in a pure @xmath2-band model .",
    "more recently the case of layered ordered alloys of the cuau or cscl types containing at least one ferromagnetic element@xcite , deposited ferromagnetic over - layers on non - magnetic substrates@xcite , and multilayers have been investigated@xcite . simultaneously the orbital magnetism driven by the spin - orbit interaction has been computed using the tight - binding model ( perturbatively@xcite or non perturbatively@xcite ) as well as ab - initio codes@xcite .    the aim of this paper is to develop a tb model allowing the determination of the magnetic properties of transition metals in various geometrical configurations , going from highly coordinated and symmetric environments to low coordinated and anisotropic geometries . in a first step",
    "we have found useful to check the validity of the model by a detailed comparison with the results provided by ab - initio methods on simple systems .",
    "in addition , the use of both methods yields a better physical understanding of these properties , and , moreover , the simplicity of our model allows a more detailed analysis of each system .",
    "we use a non - orthogonal basis set of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 valence orbitals .",
    "the parametrization of the non - magnetic and non - relativistic hamiltonian was derived by mehl and papaconstantopoulos @xcite .",
    "the possibility of spin polarization is then introduced using a stoner like model in which the splitting between the energy levels of up and down spin orbitals is governed by the stoner parameter @xmath6 and is proportional to the magnetic moment carried by @xmath2 electrons .",
    "indeed it is well known that @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons are very weakly polarized .",
    "the relativistic effects , limited to spin - orbit coupling between @xmath2 electrons , are taken into account by adding the intra atomic matrix elements of this coupling determined by a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fixed by comparison with ab - initio calculations .",
    "for the stoner parameter the variation of the magnetization as a function of interatomic distance in the bulk phase can be used .",
    "the determination of the spin - orbit coupling parameter relies on the study of the degeneracy removal of energy bands at high symmetry points or directions of the brillouin zone .",
    "we have applied our model to the study of iron in various atomic arrangements going from the bulk , in the experimentally observed phases bcc and fcc , to simple surfaces and finally to the monoatomic wire , at several interatomic distances .",
    "it is found that with a unique value of the stoner parameter we are able to reproduce the variation of the spin magnetic moment in a wide range of lattice spacings in the bcc bulk phase .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic properties of bulk fcc iron are rather complex . in spite of this complexity",
    "the calculations carried out in this work are in excellent agreement with ab - initio predictions .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling parameter is then determined , as explained above , and a single value of this parameter is able to reproduce the ab - initio band structure .",
    "furthermore the contribution of the orbital moment to the magnetization in bcc fe is very close to the experimental value .",
    "the case of surfaces represents a more stringent check since the dimensionality is reduced and all atoms are not geometrically equivalent .",
    "it is in particular interesting to follow the variation of the magnetic properties when going from the outermost to inner ( bulk - like ) layers .",
    "the spin - polarized surface projected band structure as well as the variation of the spin magnetic moment as a function of depth derived from ab - initio calculations are perfectly reproduced by our model .",
    "in particular the @xmath4 surface atoms have a saturated moment contrary to those of the @xmath3 surface .",
    "introducing the spin - orbit coupling in the tb hamiltonian allows the calculation of the mae and of the orbital magnetic moment at each inequivalent site . due to the efficiency of our model it is possible to check rigorously the convergence of these quantities when increasing the number of @xmath8 points .",
    "the orbital moment is strongly increased on surface atoms ( about twice the bulk value for the @xmath4 surface ) , and recovers its bulk value on the third and innermost layers .",
    "the wire is the most anisotropic atomic arrangement with the lowest coordinence . even though the tb parameters are fitted on bulk ab - initio data only , the non - magnetic band structure calculated with these parameters is in good agreement with ab - initio calculations , proving their good transferability . the two additional parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are also perfectly transferable .",
    "indeed , without changing the stoner parameter , the variation of the spin magnetic moment with the interatomic distance is satisfactorily reproduced ( in particular the saturated solution appears abruptly at the same interatomic spacing ) and the splitting of bands due to spin - orbit coupling is exactly the same , compared to ab - initio results .",
    "the calculation of the mae reveals that at theoretical equilibrium the easy axis is parallel to the wire , but at smaller interatomic distances corresponding to unsaturated magnetic solutions the easy axis is perpendicular to the wire .",
    "we have finally checked the validity of bruno formula @xcite relating the mae to the anisotropy of the orbital moment , and found that this relation is almost strictly obeyed around the equilibrium distance . indeed at this interatomic distance the up spin bands are filled and the exchange splitting is large compared to the @xmath2 bandwidth , which was not the case for the @xmath4 surface that , although saturated , has much a wider @xmath2 bandwidth .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the formalism of our model",
    "is presented in details , in particular the derivation of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 components of the orbital and spin moment formula in a non - orthogonal basis set .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling being small we have recalled the perturbation treatment of the mae and of the orbital moment , from which the analytical expression of the anisotropy laws are directly obtained , and are used to analyze our numerical results . in section 3 the stoner parameter is determined and used to study in detail the magnetic properties of bcc and fcc iron .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of @xmath4 and @xmath3 surfaces . finally in section 5",
    "we present an exhaustive study of the monoatomic wire .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "we choose as a basis set the real _ s , p _ and _ d _ valence atomic orbitals centered on each site @xmath12 .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath5 indices ( @xmath14 ) and numbered as follows : @xmath15 , the @xmath16 coordinates being taken along the crystal axes .",
    "the tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian for the non - magnetic ( nm ) state is then completely determined by its intra - atomic matrix elements ( i.e. , the _ s , p _ and _ d _ atomic levels ) @xmath17 and its interatomic matrix elements ( i.e. , the hopping integrals ) @xmath18 which have been tabulated as a function of 10 slater - koster ( sk ) parameters ( @xmath19 ) and of the direction cosines of the bonding direction * r@xmath20*@xcite . following the ( mp )",
    "scheme developed by mehl and papaconstantopoulos @xcite , the atomic levels depend on the atomic environment ( number of neighbors and interatomic distances ) while the sk parameters are function of @xmath21 only .",
    "finally the schroedinger equation in the atomic orbital basis involves also overlap integrals @xmath22 depending on the bonding direction @xmath23 when the non - orthogonality of the basis set is taken into account",
    ". all these quantities ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath22 ) are written as analytic functions depending on a number of parameters which are determined by a least mean square fit of the results of ab - initio electronic structure ( band structure and total energy ) calculations either in the local density ( lda ) or in the generalized gradient ( gga ) approximations .",
    "these parametrizations will be denoted as tblda and tbgga in the following .",
    "the analytical form of the functions can be found in ref.@xcite and the numerical values of the parameters for fe can be found in ref.@xcite .    in order to account for spin polarization , we use a simplified hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme @xcite to define atomic levels depending on spin ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "these diagonal elements of the hamiltonian can be written in the basis of spin - orbitals @xmath25 in which the spin quantization axis is parallel to the magnetization ( @xmath26 for up(down ) spin ) . when all atoms in the system are geometrically equivalent we get :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the total number of electrons and the total moment on each atom , respectively , in _ s , p _ and _ d _ orbitals while @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the total occupation number ( i.e. , for both spins ) and moment in orbital @xmath32 .",
    "finally the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameters are coulomb and exchange integrals which involve two different orbitals , save for @xmath35 , and are assumed to depend only on the orbital quantum numbers of these orbitals .",
    "we further assume that the asphericity of both the charge distribution and magnetic polarization can be neglected , i.e. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . in these conditions ,",
    "when the system is non magnetic all the non vanishing terms in eqs.[eq : hflevels ] are accounted for implicitly by the expression of @xmath17 in the mp scheme @xcite .",
    "in addition the equations giving the atomic levels can be further simplified by noting that the spin polarization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons is very small . as a consequence eq.[eq : hflevels ] can be approximated by :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 are the nm levels @xcite and @xmath42 can be identified with the stoner parameter . the numerical value of this parameter will be determined in section 3.1 in order to reproduce as closely as possible the variation of the magnetic moment as a function of the interatomic distance that can be obtained from an ab - initio calculation .",
    "finally , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath6 @xcite and we have taken @xmath45 .",
    "this completely defines our tb spin polarized hamiltonian @xmath46 in the absence of spin - orbit coupling for a system of equivalent atoms , and when the overlaps are neglected .    in the general case where overlaps are taken into account and all atoms in the systems",
    "are not geometrically equivalent , the hamiltonian becomes :    @xmath47    @xmath48 are the matrix elements provided by the mp parametrization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the second term in which @xmath49 is the net total charge on atom @xmath12 , prevents large charge transfers when inequivalent atoms are present , and will be discussed in section 4 . finally in the last term which accounts for spin polarization @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction for a single atom is given by :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the atomic potential , @xmath55 is the momentum operator and are the pauli matrices .",
    "taking into account the spherical symmetry of the potential , @xmath56 can be rewritten as :    @xmath57    with :    @xmath58    @xmath59 and @xmath60 are , respectively , the angular orbital and spin momentum operators .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath56 in the basis of atomic spin - orbitals @xmath61 are :    @xmath62    with :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the radial part of the atomic orbital @xmath13 and @xmath65 denotes its angular part . since @xmath66 is well localized around @xmath67 , @xmath68 has a non negligible value only when @xmath64 and @xmath69 are also well localized , i.e. , for transition metals , when both @xmath13 and @xmath5 are _ d _ orbitals in which case @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .    in the tight - binding approximation",
    "the crystal potential is written as @xmath73 and @xmath56 becomes :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the angular orbital momentum operator with respect to the center @xmath12 . for transition metals and due to the localized character of @xmath76 we can neglect all matrix elements of @xmath77 save for the intra - atomic ones between @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "these matrix elements are the same at each site and given in appendix a in the spin framework @xmath78 . in this framework",
    "@xmath79 is the spin quantization axis defined by its polar and azimuthal angles @xmath80 relative to the crystal axes .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 axes have been chosen in the following way : the @xmath83 axes of the crystal are first rotated by the angle @xmath84 around @xmath11 , this gives a new framework @xmath85 which is then rotated by an angle @xmath86 around @xmath87 .",
    "the orbital and spin moments are usually expressed in units of @xmath88 so that @xmath7 is a parameter which has the dimension of an energy .",
    "its numerical value will be deduced from ab - initio calculations in the following .",
    "let us first compute the average value of the three components of the total spin @xmath89 in the spin framework .",
    "if we choose as a basis set of spin - orbitals the direct product of the orbitals @xmath90 with the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath91 denoted as @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the electron eigenfunctions @xmath94 in the crystal can be written :    @xmath95    ( note that in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , there is no spin mixing in these eigenstates and , since the matrix elements of @xmath46 are real , it is always possible to find a set of eigenvectors whose components are real and denoted as @xmath96 in the following ) .",
    "the average values of the three spin components are given by :    @xmath97    in a non orthogonal orbital basis set , we obtain :    @xmath98    i.e. , in the absence of spin - orbit coupling @xmath99 .",
    "for a system with full translational symmetry and a single atom per unit cell , the bloch theorem yields ( @xmath100 or @xmath93 ) :    @xmath101    since each eigenstate @xmath102 is labelled by a band index ( @xmath103 ) and a wave vector @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 is the number of atoms .",
    "the spin components are the same on all sites @xmath12 and are given by :    @xmath106    with @xmath107 .",
    "when all atoms are not geometrically equivalent , we can define a spin on site @xmath12 by identifying in eqs.[eq : spintot ] all the terms involving this site and , similarly to what is done to define mulliken charges , the overlap cross terms ( i.e. , those in which only one of the site indices is equal to @xmath12 ) are multiplied by a factor @xmath108 to avoid a double counting of these terms .",
    "this condition ensures that these `` local '' spins are real and that their sum is equal to the total spin .",
    "for example in a periodic system with several atoms per unit cell the local spin on each atom in the cell are given by equations similar to equation [ eq : spintot_periodic ] with an additional index , labelling the atom in the cell .",
    "for instance in a slab the local spin moment @xmath109 on layer @xmath110 is given by :    @xmath111    with @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is the number of atoms in each layer of the slab and @xmath114 the wave vector parallel to the surface , each atom being now labelled by a cell index , @xmath115 or @xmath116 , and a layer index , @xmath110 or @xmath117 .",
    "corresponding changes must be made for the two other components of @xmath118 .",
    "finally let us recall that the spin magnetic moment @xmath119 is related to the spin @xmath120 by @xmath121 ( in bohr magnetons @xmath122 ) .",
    "up to now the orbital moment in the tb approximation has always been calculated by assuming an orthogonal basis set of atomic orbitals and only its @xmath79 component was determined . in these conditions ,",

    "finally , let us note that in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the direction of the total magnetization ( @xmath142 ) may not strictly be parallel to the spin quantization axis @xmath79 .",
    "however @xmath56 being a small perturbation in fe , we will often denote the spin quantization axis as the magnetization direction in the following .",
    "we have seen in section 2.2 that spin - orbit effects can be limited to @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "furthermore the overlaps between these orbitals are close to zero and the spin - orbit coupling is a weak perturbation since @xmath7 is much smaller than the fe @xmath2 bandwidth . consequently spin - orbit coupling effects can be understood using a simple perturbation theory with a basis set of orthogonal @xmath2 orbitals @xcite .",
    "let us consider the perturbation of the total energy due to @xmath56 .",
    "since the matrix elements of @xmath56 are a function of @xmath86 and @xmath84 , this introduces an angular dependence of this perturbation which is known as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the first order term can be written :    @xmath143    where @xmath144 is an unperturbed state of energy @xmath145 , i.e. ,    @xmath146    thus :    @xmath147    it is easily seen that @xmath148 vanishes since for each spin the @xmath149 matrix @xmath150 is imaginary ( see appendix a ) .",

    "it can be seen from eqs.[eq : de2 ] and [ eq : lizs ] that @xmath174 and the anisotropic part of @xmath158 are both given by quadratic functions of the direction cosines of the spin quantization axis relative to the crystal ones since the involved matrix elements of @xmath155 are all proportional to one of these direction cosines ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these two functions present some similarity , but spin - flip excitations contribute to @xmath158 but not to @xmath175 .",
    "however , if the exchange splitting is large enough compared to the @xmath2 bandwidth , the spin up band is completely filled and the contribution of spin - flip excitations to @xmath158 is negligible due to the large value of the energy denominator . in this condition , for each site @xmath12 , the anisotropy of @xmath158 and @xmath174 are proportional :    @xmath176    note that this relation was already derived by bruno @xcite for fcc monolayers with a single atom per unit cell . finally let us point out that for bulk cubic crystals with a single atom per unit cell both @xmath177 and @xmath175 are isotropic at the orders of perturbation considered .      for the sake of comparison we have also performed spin - polarized ab - initio calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) using the pwscf code of @xmath178-espresso package@xcite with ultrasoft pseudopotentials including non - linear core corrections .",

    "for all calculations involving magnetic anisotropy we checked that our results did not change by more than a few hundredth of mev ( at most 0.1mev in the worst case ) . in the case of pwscf calculations",
    "the use of plane waves imposes a periodically repeated geometry and one must also avoid as much as possible electronic interactions by using large unit cells .",
    "the monatomic wires were separated by 30a.u . , but for surfaces , we have been less demanding since we only calculated the magnetic moment and therefore the slabs were separated by approximately 17a.u .",
    "in our tbhf model , the magnetism is entirely governed by the value of the stoner parameter @xmath6 . it is well known that , in unsaturated magnetic materials like fe , the magnetic moment is very sensitive to the precise value of the equilibrium interatomic distance . as a general trend",

    "indeed these states are extremely sensitive to the energy shift induced by the renormalization of the intra - atomic terms of the tb hamiltonian . here",

    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : surf110_bands ] ) which disappears in the up spin band structure .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with previous ab - initio calculations @xcite in particular , for the position and dispersion of the characteristic down spin surface state discussed above .",
    "it is well known that the lowering of coordination induces a narrowing of the density of states which usually enhances the magnetic moment .",
    "consequently , it is expected that open surfaces should have larger surface magnetic moments than close - packed ones .",
    "we have therefore carried out self consistent tbgga and pwscf gga calculations for @xmath4 and @xmath3 surfaces .",
    "the @xmath4 surface being more open than the @xmath3 one , since each atom from their outermost layer looses 4 and 2 first nearest neighbors , respectively , we expect larger surface magnetic moments for the @xmath4 than for the @xmath3 surface .",
    "[ fig : surf_spin_moment ] shows that this general rule of thumb is well obeyed .",
    "actually two clear features are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : surf_spin_moment ] : the magnetic moment is more reinforced on the @xmath4 than on the @xmath3 surface ( + 38% and + 14% , respectively , for the outermost layer compared to the bulk ) .",

    "an excellent agreement is once again observed between pwscf and tbgga results , in particular the spin moment is almost saturated on the outermost layer of the @xmath4 surface in both calculations .",
    "let us however note that the agreement is less perfect within tblda ( not shown ) , which can be attributed to the wrong atomic configuration obtained in this model which deteriorates the @xmath209 charge distribution on the surface plane .",
    "and @xmath3 slabs ( with 20 atomic layers ) of bcc fe obtained from the tbgga model and pwscf code with gga .",
    "layer 1 corresponds to the outermost layer and layer 10 to a central layer .",
    "the value of the bulk magnetic moment is indicated as a reference . ]      for surfaces the magneto - crystalline anisotropy is usually one or two orders of magnitude larger than in the bulk .",
    "indeed , it is well known that , contrary to the bulk , this anisotropy is of the second order in @xmath7 at surfaces .",
    "actually , we have seen in section 2.4 that second order perturbation theory predicts that the magneto - crystalline anisotropy is a quadratic function of the direction cosines ( @xmath210 ) of the spin quantization axis relative to crystal axes . by imposing the symmetry properties of the surface to this quadratic form the following laws are easily derived :    @xmath211    for the @xmath4 surface with @xmath9 and @xmath10 crystal axes parallel to the edges of the square two dimensional cell , and :    @xmath212    on the @xmath3 surface .",
    "for this surface the crystal axes are chosen as follows : the @xmath11 axis is perpendicular to the surface and the @xmath10 one is parallel to the second nearest neighbor direction in the surface .     with respect to the number of @xmath8 points @xmath213 in the first brillouin zone , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 fe bcc , unsupported monolayers .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is oscillating around its asymptotic value ( full straight line ) with an amplitude below @xmath214 mev when @xmath213 is larger than 1000 . ]    in table [ tab : ansurf ] we present the results of tbgga calculations on @xmath4 and @xmath3 slabs of two thicknesses .",
    "we have first checked the convergence of the magnetic anisotropy with respect to the number of @xmath8-points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv_kpoints ] that a good convergence is obtained above 1000 @xmath8-points .",
    "it is found that for both orientations the easy axis is perpendicular to the surface plane .",
    "the two surfaces , however , have a different behavior with respect to in - plane magnetization . for the @xmath4 surface the energy is changing by only @xmath215ev between a magnetic configuration along the square edge ( @xmath216 ) and along the diagonal of the square ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "this confirms our previous symmetry analysis which predicts no in - plane dependence of the energy at second order in perturbation . in the case of the @xmath3 slab with 11 layers",
    "the in - plane energy variation is almost one order of magnitude larger and plays in favor of the second nearest neighbor atomic direction ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "consequently the anisotropy is very small in the @xmath219 plane .",
    "let us also point out that isolated monolayers show a more pronounced out of plane anisotropy while the in - plane energy profile seems to be less corrugated than for thicker layers in the case of the @xmath3 orientation .",
    ".magneto - crystalline anisotropy , @xmath220 being the total energy ( per surface unit cell ) corresponding to a magnetization direction defined by the angles @xmath221 with respect to the crystal axes ( see text ) for slabs of bcc fe with @xmath4 and @xmath3 orientations : @xmath222 is the number of layers and @xmath213 is the number of @xmath8 points in the first brillouin zone used in the calculation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in presence of a surface the coordination is reduced and the symmetry is lowered leading to an enhancement of the spin moments as discussed above . at surfaces the orbital moment is also enhanced as demonstrated in several theoretical and experimental @xcite works . our calculations on @xmath4 and @xmath3 slabs show that the component @xmath170 of the orbital moment on the magnetization direction is noticeably increased when @xmath12 belongs to the outermost layer , especially for the ( 001 ) surface . on the second layer this component has almost recovered its bulk value for the @xmath3 surface whereas oscillations occur for the @xmath4 surface similarly to the behavior of the spin moment .",
    "finally @xmath170 , contrary to the spin moment , depends sensitively on the direction of the magnetization with the same type of laws ( eqs.[eq : k001 ] and [ eq : k110 ] ) as the magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "however it is found that for @xmath223 the @xmath84 dependence predicted by eq.[eq : k110 ] for the @xmath3 surface is almost negligible . on the contrary",
    "the variation of @xmath170 with @xmath86 is noticeable and , in this respect , the two surfaces behave differently : when the magnetization direction is rotated from @xmath224 to @xmath223 , @xmath170 decreases for the @xmath4 surface while it increases for the @xmath3 one .",
    "in addition , this variation is larger in absolute value on the @xmath4 than on the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "finally it is expected that equation [ eq : rap_ani ] should be more obeyed for @xmath4 surface than for the @xmath3 since the spin moment at the outermost plane is saturated for the former and not for the latter .",
    "assuming that the contribution to the magnetocrystalline energy comes from the outermost plane only , the ratio of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy to that of the orbital moment for surface atoms , has the wrong sign for @xmath3 , while for the @xmath4 surface the sign is correct but the ratio is around three times smaller than @xmath225 .",
    "indeed the exchange splitting of the @xmath4 surface is smaller than the @xmath2 bandwidth and the contribution of spin - flip excitations to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can not be neglected .",
    "and @xmath4 slabs ( 20 layers ) for a magnetization perpendicular ( @xmath224 ) or parallel to the surface ( @xmath226 ) . ]",
    "although the study of the unsupported monatomic wire , i.e. , a periodic linear chain of identical atoms with a single atom per unit cell , is somewhat academic it is however an interesting object for the following reasons : i ) it can be used as a model since analytical tb results can be derived which are useful for a theoretical understanding and a direct identification of the orbital character of the bands obtained in ab - initio calculations , ii ) it also allows to investigate how a reduced dimensionality may modify magnetism in ferromagnetic metals@xcite or induce it in non - magnetic materials@xcite , iii ) last , but not least , such objects , several atom long , have been observed in break junction experiments @xcite ( unfortunately not for fe , co or ni ) .",
    "the band structure of the non magnetic fe monatomic wire , neglecting spin - orbit coupling , obtained from the tblda model and from the ab - initio pwscf code in the gga are shown in fig.[fig : wire_bands_nomag ] for an interatomic distance of 4.29 a.u.(2.27 ) , _ i.e. _ , at the equilibrium distance predicted from the spin polarized pwscf gga calculations . it can be seen that except for the upper band in the pwscf band structure , the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "let us now identify the character of the bands by using the simplest tb model , i.e. , in which overlap is neglected and hopping integrals are restricted to first nearest neighbors .",
    "we take the @xmath11 axis along the chain . for a given spin the ( @xmath227 ) hopping matrix",
    "can be rearranged into five square blocks on the diagonal : the first one involves @xmath228 and @xmath229 orbitals , the second and third ones are identical and involve ( @xmath230 ) and @xmath231 orbitals , respectively , finally the fourth and fifth ones are also identical and correspond to the @xmath232 and @xmath233 orbitals , respectively .",
    "consequently , taking into account spin degeneracy , the band structure consists in three two - fold degenerate bands of symmetry @xmath126 , two four - fold degenerate bands of symmetry @xmath234 and one four - fold degenerate band of symmetry @xmath235 .",
    "the @xmath235 band is easily identified as being the flattest band which disperses positively .",

    "the @xmath1 level is much higher in energy than the @xmath2 level . as a consequence ,",
    "the mixing between @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals is small and the @xmath234 bands split into a lower band with an almost pure @xmath237 ( or @xmath238 character and a higher one with an almost pure @xmath239 or @xmath240 character .",
    "the first one shows a dispersion very similar to that of a linear chain of @xmath237 ( or @xmath238 orbitals , i.e. , it disperses negatively since the corresponding integral @xmath241 is positive .",
    "the second one disperses positively since @xmath242 is negative , this band is present in the pwscf calculation , but is outside the energy range of fig.[fig : wire_bands_nomag ] in the tblda results .",
    "this means that the tb parameters relative to @xmath1 bands are not very accurate but since the higher @xmath234 band is unoccupied , this inaccuracy will have no influence on our results for the ground state .",
    "the two remaining bands are the two lowest @xmath126 bands .",
    "an analysis of the character of these bands using the tblda model shows that the lowest band has almost no @xmath1 character , the weight of @xmath0 and @xmath229 orbitals are almost the same at the @xmath243 point while at the @xmath244 point , the state is almost a pure @xmath2 one . for the next @xmath126 band",
    "the @xmath229 character decreases continuously from @xmath245 to @xmath162 along @xmath246 , the @xmath247 character increases continuously from 0 to 1 while the @xmath0 character is @xmath245 at @xmath243 , has a maximum at the midpoint and vanishes at the @xmath244 point .      as in the bulk we have studied the appearance of a magnetic moment when the interatomic distance @xmath2 increases using the tblda model as well as the pwscf code with gga . as seen in fig.[fig : m_d_wire ] a low spin state ( ls ) is found at short interatomic distances with a slowly increasing moment , then , around @xmath248 a.u .",
    ", the moment increases abruptly to reach a high spin state ( hs ) corresponding to the saturated configuration .",
    "the agreement between both methods is quite satisfactory , in particular , the hs state appears at the same interatomic distance .",
    "it should however be mentioned that the tbgga fails to reproduce the wire band structure in the range of interatomic distances involved at the transition due to an incorrect position of the @xmath0 level . actually , for interatomic distances around 3.8 a.u .",
    "this @xmath0 level is pushed at higher energies and instead of a ls / hs transition one finds a nm / hs transition .",
    "let us recall that the tb parameters are fitted on bulk results only , and for interatomic distances and coordinence larger than in the wire .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation of the law giving the atomic levels as a function of the atomic environment may fail for the wire . from the above study it appears that the tblda levels are much better than the gga ones . as a consequence , in the following , lda parameters will be used .",
    "the removal of degeneracies due to the spin - orbit coupling can be predicted by perturbation theory . as seen in fig.[fig : wire_bands_nomag ] two types of degeneracies occur for the wire : in addition to spin degeneracy , either a band is degenerate for any value of * k * due to symmetry or the degeneracy is limited to band crossings . in the former case",
    "@xmath56 may produce a splitting of the bands while in the latter it may open a gap between the two crossing bands .",
    "let us first consider the non magnetic case for which the band structure should be independent of @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",

    "the same type of arguments applies to the lowest four - fold @xmath234 band if the small @xmath1 character is neglected but the coupling matrix element is now @xmath252 and therefore the band splitting is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "no removal of degeneracy is expected on the two - fold @xmath126 bands since there is no matrix elements of @xmath56 between the @xmath229 orbitals of opposite spins . finally in the unperturbed band structure ( fig.[fig : wire_bands_nomag ] ) there are two crossing points with the @xmath126 and @xmath235 bands which are not coupled by @xmath56 .",
    "thus there is no removal of degeneracy . on the contrary the other crossing points ( between @xmath126 and @xmath234 bands , or @xmath234 and @xmath235 bands ) are avoided .    in the magnetic case",
    "the band structure is independent of @xmath84 for symmetry reasons but depends on the polar angle @xmath86 when spin - orbit coupling is taken into account .",
    "this is the consequence of the removal of spin degeneracy in the unperturbed state . indeed for @xmath224 ,",
    "@xmath56 couples states with the same spin and a splitting @xmath253 exists in the @xmath235 ( lowest @xmath234 ) bands , for both spins , while for @xmath223 , the bands of up and down spins being well separated in energy , @xmath56 has a negligible effect on the @xmath235 and lowest @xmath234 bands .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath280 , where @xmath65 and @xmath281 are the angular parts of @xmath2 orbitals @xmath282 centered at the same site as the angular momentum operator , can be easily calculated as a function of the direction ( defined by the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath86 and @xmath84 relative to the crystal axes ) of the spin quantization axis @xmath79 which is often taken in the magnetization direction that may be different from the @xmath11 axis of the crystal .",
    "this is achieved by choosing a new coordinate framework @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath79 referred to as the spin framework which is obtained by rotating first the @xmath283 axes of the crystal by the angle @xmath84 around @xmath11 .",
    "this gives a new framework @xmath85 which is then rotated by the angle @xmath86 around @xmath87 .",
    "using the matrix elements of * l * in the basis of real d orbitals :    @xmath284    @xmath285    @xmath286    one finds :    @xmath287    @xmath288    where @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "the other blocks of the @xmath291 spin - orbit matrix are obtained from the relations :    @xmath292    in which @xmath293 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "in addition a very useful relation has been derived by bruno@xcite :    @xmath294 + { \\langle \\bar{\\lambda}\\uparrow|}{\\bf l}.{\\bf s}{|\\bar{\\mu}\\uparrow\\rangle } { \\langle \\bar{\\mu}'\\uparrow|}{\\bf l}.{\\bf s}{|\\bar{\\lambda}'\\uparrow\\rangle }   = \\text{cst.}\\ ] ]    let us note however that the spin quantization axis could have been taken along the @xmath11 axis of the crystal , in which case the spin - orbit matrix elements would be given by the above matrices with @xmath295 but the spin polarized term of the hamiltonian becomes :    @xmath296\\otimes \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos\\theta & \\exp(-i\\varphi)\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\exp(i\\varphi)\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath297 means the direct product of matrices .    in the case of collinear spins and in the presence of",
    "spin - orbit coupling the first point of view is more convenient to treat spin - orbit coupling effects within perturbation theory since @xmath56 describes the perturbation completely .",
    "the second point of view is preferable when dealing with non - collinear spins .",
    "indeed this avoids the transformation of the inter - atomic part of @xmath46 since , in that case , the spin functions are not the same at the two sites .",
    "let us generalize eq.[eq : lseci ] to take overlap into account .",
    "if we note that the integral in eq.[eq : lric ] gives the population of the spin - orbital @xmath131 , an obvious generalization is to replace this population by the mulliken one .",
    "thus @xmath124 becomes :                                                                                                          stearns m b in landolt - brnstein numerical data and functional relationships in science and technology , edited by wijn h p j(springer - verlag , berlin , 1986 ) , group 3 , vol .",

    "<S> this is also true for the orbital moment , which in addition is highly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it is shown that when the spin quantization axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the wire the average orbital moment is not aligned with the spin quantization axis . at equilibrium distance </S>",
