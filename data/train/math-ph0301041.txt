    "in two - dimensional systems with orientational degrees of freedom , it is often fruitful to focus on the nodal points ( zeros , defects ) , and to ignore other degrees of freedom .",

    "we will compute moments of the _ signed _ density @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the positions of the extrema with sign ( charge ) @xmath7 .    from the experimental point of view , measuring the _ absolute _ mean values of the density , @xmath8 , is much easier than measuring the usually small density difference between the density of the positive points minus the density of the negative ones . the signed density , however , is the much more appealing object from the mathematical point of view .",
    "the signed density is subject to a topological constraint , and its averages are differential geometrical objects , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we represent the signed density of the extremal points of a @xmath9-dimensional scalar field @xmath0 through @xcite @xmath10 in order to calculate the average of the absolute density @xmath11 , one needs the simultaneous distribution of the @xmath12 random variables @xmath13 and of the @xmath9 variables @xmath2 , where both sets are gaussian random variables .",
