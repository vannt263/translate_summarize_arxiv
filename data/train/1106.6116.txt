    "ultracold fermi gases are very useful for the study of many - body physics in strongly interacting fermion systems . indeed , using a tunable interaction associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite",
    ", we can study strong - coupling effects on single - particle properties , as well as thermodynamic properties@xcite , from the weak - coupling bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ) regime to the strong - coupling bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) regime in a unified manner . in particular , the so - called pseudogap phenomenon , which is a typical phenomenon in strong - coupling fermion systems ,",
    "has recently attracted much attention in cold fermi gases .",
    "the photoemission spectra observed in a @xmath3k fermi gas@xcite clearly deviates from those for a free fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region . as the origin of this ,",
    "the importance of pairing fluctuations has been pointed out@xcite . since the pseudogap phenomenon has been also discussed in high-@xmath1 cuprates@xcite , the study of cold fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover region is expected to be helpful for clarifying various anomalies observed in high-@xmath1 cuprates .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the local density of states ( ldos ) , as well as the local pressure , and effects of pseudogap effects associated with strong pairing fluctuations in a trapped unitarity fermi superfluid . for this purpose",
    ", we employ a combined @xmath0-matrix theory with the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we note that this strong - coupling theory has succeeded in quantitatively explaining the anomalous behavior of the photoemission spectra observed in a @xmath3k fermi gas@xcite . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we show that the spatial inhomogeneity due to the trap potential naturally leads to the coexistence of the spatial region where the ordinary bcs excitation gap can be seen and the region where the pseudogap still dominates over single - particle excitations in a gas cloud .",
    "we also apply this theory to the local pressure which has been recently observed in a @xmath2li fermi gas@xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath4 throughout this paper .",
    "we consider a trapped superfluid fermi gas with two atomic hyperfine states , described by pseudo spin @xmath5 .",
    "the model hamiltonian in the absence of a trap is given by , in the nambu representation@xcite , @xmath6\\psi_{\\bm p}-\\frac{u}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm q},j=1,2}\\rho_j({\\bm q})\\rho_j(-{\\bm q}).\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is the two - component nambu field , where @xmath8 is the creation operator of a fermi atom with the kinetic energy @xmath9 , measured from the chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 are pauli matrices acting on the particle - hole space , and the superfluid order parameter @xmath12 is chosen so as to be proportional to the @xmath13 component .",
    "@xmath14 are the generalized density operators , describing amplitude @xmath15 and phase @xmath16 fluctuations in the cooper channel .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is a pairing interaction which is assumed to be tunable . in this paper , we consider the case of unitarity limit , @xmath19 , where the scattering length @xmath20 is related to the pairing interaction @xmath17 as @xmath21@xcite .",
    "effects of a trap is included within the lda , which is conveniently achieved by replacing the fermi chemical potential @xmath10 by the lda expression @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a harmonic trap .",
    "various quantities then depend on the position @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the lda single - particle green s function has the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the fermion matsubara frequency ) , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the lda superfluid order parameter .",
    "@xmath30 is an lda self - energy correction , involving effects of pairing fluctuations within the @xmath0-matrix approximation , which is given by @xmath31 . here ,",
    "@xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the boson matsubara frequency .",
    "$ ] is the particle - particle scattering vertex , where @xmath35 $ ] is a pair correlation function .     in the unitarity limit ( @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fermi temperature ) .",
    "( a ) @xmath38 .",
    "( b ) @xmath39 .",
    "( c ) @xmath40 . in each panel , we have offset the results .",
    "@xmath41 is obtained as ( a ) @xmath42 , ( b ) @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the thomas - fermi radius ( where @xmath46 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "panel ( d ) is the phase diagram in the unitarity limit . ",
    "sf \" is the region where the superfluid gap can be seen in ldos .",
    " pg \" is the region dominated by pseudogap . ",
    "nf \" is the region where ldos is close to that for a normal fermi gas .",
    "the solid line in panel ( d ) shows @xmath47 . ]",
    "we self - consistently determine the superfluid order parameter @xmath29 and the chemical potential @xmath10 by solving the lda gap equation , @xmath48 together with the equation for the number @xmath49 of fermi atoms , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the particle density in the lda .",
    "the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath1 is determined as the temperature at which the gap equation ( [ eq.gap ] ) with @xmath52 is satisfied in the trap center @xmath53@xcite .",
    "we note that , below @xmath1 , the coupled equations ( [ eq.gap ] ) with ( [ bcs ] ) give the situation that @xmath54 when @xmath55 and @xmath52 when @xmath56 , where @xmath41 becomes large with decreasing the temperature",
    ". however , this is an artifact of the lda , because @xmath29 should be finite everywhere in the gas below @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we should regard @xmath41 as a characteristic radius , in the inside of which @xmath57 is large to some extent .",
    "once @xmath29 and @xmath10 are determined , ldos is calculated from @xmath58 . for the local pressure @xmath59 , using the relation @xmath60@xcite for a given temperature , we obtain @xmath61",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the ldos in unitarity limit at @xmath1 .",
    "although @xmath29 vanishes at @xmath1 , we see a large dip structure around @xmath62 in the trap center , originating from strong pairing fluctuations .",
    "however , such a dip structure is absent around the edge of the gas .",
    "below @xmath1 , the pseudogap in the trap center is suppressed by the presence of finite @xmath29 .",
    "instead , the superfluid gap with the coherence peaks at the excitation edges appears ( see figs.[fig1](b ) and ( c ) ) . in panel ( b )",
    ", the pseudogap is found to appear around @xmath63 . by definition , @xmath64 is satisfied at @xmath63 , which is the same form as the @xmath1-equation when @xmath41 is replaced by @xmath53 . thus , as in the case of the trap center at @xmath1 , strong pairing fluctuations induce the pseudogap around @xmath63 .",
    "when we define the pseudogap regime as the region where the dip structure appears in ldos , we obtain the phase diagram shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](d ) .",
    "as expected , the pseudogap regime ( pg ) exists around the  @xmath41-line . \"",
    "we briefly note that the pseudogap regime exists even below this line where @xmath29 is finite . below this pseudogap regime ( denoted by  sf \" in fig.[fig1](d ) ) , the superfluid gap accompanied by the coherence peaks appear in the ldos . on the other hand , above the pseudogap regime , neither the pseudogap nor the superfluid gap appears in ldos , which is denoted by  nf \" in panel ( d ) .",
    "figure [ fig1](d ) indicates that the sf region and pg region coexists below @xmath1 in a trapped superfluid fermi gas .",
    "strong - coupling effects can be also seen in the local pressure @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "that is , @xmath59 is remarkably enhanced from that for a free fermi gas @xmath65 ( where the same chemical potential @xmath10 that used in @xmath59 is also used . ) in this figure , @xmath59 is found to be almost temperature independent , reflecting the university of the unitarity fermi gas . as shown in this figure ,",
    "our results agree well with the recent experiment ( solid circles ) done by ens group@xcite .     in the unitarity limit .",
    "solid circles are experimental results observed by ens group@xcite .",
    "@xmath59 is normalized by the local pressure @xmath65 in the case of a trapped free fermi gas with the same chemical potential @xmath10 . ]",
    "to summarize , we have discussed inhomogeneous pseudogap phenomena in the unitarity limit of a trapped superfluid fermi gas . within the framework of the combined @xmath0-matrix theory with the lda , we determined the spatial and temperature region in the gas cloud where the pseudogap appears .",
    "we also showed how the local pressure is affected by strong pairing interaction .",
    "the quantitative agreement of our results with the recent experiment by ens group indicates the validity of the strong - coupling theory used in this paper for the superfluid fermi gas in the unitarity regime .",
    "our results would be helpful for the study of strong - coupling effects on trapped fermi superfluids .",
