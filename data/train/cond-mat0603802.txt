    "despite the long history of quantum mechanics , the quantum measurement problem continues to attract interest motivated mostly by the counter - intuitive features of the `` wavefunction reduction '' .",
    "although dynamics of any measurement set - up is governed by the schrdinger equation with an appropriate hamiltonian , full description of the measurement process can not be obtained without account of the changes in the wavefunction of the measured system caused by the random process of selection of one specific outcome of measurement out of the range of possible outcomes .",
    "this selection process is trivial in the case of classical dynamics , when all possible outcomes of measurement are `` orthogonal '' and the observation of the measured system in one particular state does not imply any changes in the system beyond the statement that it occupies this and not any other state . for a quantum system",
    ", however , existence of the non - commuting observables implies that selection of one particular outcome of measurement can change the wavefunction of the system in a highly non - trivial way .",
    "such a reduction of the wavefunction appears as an evolution principle additional to the schrdinger equation .",
    "moreover , the changes in the wavefunction of the measured system induced by it can violate the basic features of dynamics which follows from the schrdinger equation , despite the fact that the measurement process as a whole is governed by this equation .",
    "the best known example of this situation is the case of epr correlations @xcite between the two spatially separated spins , which violate the no - action - at - a - distance principle as quantified by the bell s inequalities @xcite . from the perspective of the wavefunction reduction , the epr correlations appear as a result of selection of one random specific outcome of the local spin measurement . on average , there is no action - at - a - distance in a sense that the correlations by themselves can not lead to information transfer between the points where the spins are located .",
    "current interest to the solid - state quantum information processing ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) , motivates development of mesoscopic solid - state structures that can serve both as simple quantum systems , e.g. , qubits or harmonic oscillators , and the detectors .",
    "although in experiments , the mesoscopic detectors did not reach the stage yet where they can be used to look into the basic questions of the quantum measurement theory ( which requires the quantum - limited detection ) one can expect this to happen quite soon . a new element introduced by the mesoscopic structures in the discussion of quantum measurements",
    "is the fact that the wavefunction reduction is not necessarily caused by interaction of a `` microscopic '' measured system with the `` macroscopic '' detector . in mesoscopic structures , the measured systems and",
    "the detectors are similar in many respects ( including dimensions and typical dynamics ) and are frequently interchangeable : a measured system in one context can act as the detector in the other , and vice versa .",
    "this shows that the boundary at which the quantum coherent dynamics should be complemented with the wavefunction reduction is not universal .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a quantitative discussion of models and measurement dynamics of the mesoscopic detectors .",
    "the discussion emphasizes the interplay between the dynamic and information sides of the measurement process and can serve as an introduction to the problem of wavefunction reduction in mesoscopic structures .",
    "majority of the mesoscopic detectors use as their operating principle ability of a measured system to control the transport of some particles between the two reservoirs .",
    "the information about the state of the system is contained then in the magnitude of the particle current between the reservoirs which serves as the detector output . in the most direct form",
    ", this principle is implemented in the quantum point contact ( qpc ) detector  @xcite , which presently is the main detector used for measurements of the quantum dot qubits  @xcite . in the qpc detector ( fig .",
    "[ fm2 ] ) , the propagating particles are electrons which move ballistically through a short one - dimensional constriction formed between the two electrodes of the qpc . the electrodes can be viewed as reservoirs of independent and effectively non - interacting electrons .",
    "the measured system creates electrostatic potential that makes the scattering potential @xmath0 for electrons in the constriction dependent on the state @xmath1 of the system , and in this way controls transmission probability of the qpc .",
    "the output of the qpc detector is the electric current @xmath2 driven by the voltage difference @xmath3 between the electrodes .",
    "the current depends on the electron transmission probability , and as a result , contains information about the state @xmath1 . since interaction between the qpc electrons and the measured system",
    "is dominated by the electrostatic potential , the qpc acts as the charge detector .",
    "another example of the ballistic mesoscopic detector is the magnetic analog of the qpc based on the ballistic motion of the magnetic flux quanta ( fluxons ) through a one - dimensional channel , the role of which is played by the josephson transmission line ( jtl )  @xcite .",
    "the scattering potential @xmath0 for the fluxons in the jtl is created by the magnetic flux or current , and the jtl detector can be used for measurements of superconducting flux qubits . in the jtl detector",
    ", the fluxons can be injected into the jtl individually providing control over the individual scattering events .",
    "the detector model in which the output information is contained in the transport current flowing between the two reservoirs applies to many of the mesoscopic detectors ( see sec . 4 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "one is the strong ( in the tunnel limit , exponential ) dependence of the scattering amplitudes on parameters of the scattering potential that leads to sufficiently large sensitivity of the detector to the measured system .",
    "another , more important , is the fact that the scattering dynamics contains strongly divergent transmitted and reflected trajectories that create easily detectable different outcomes of measurement .",
    "this feature of scattering is not easily reproducible in other types of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "finally , the transport between large reservoirs makes it possible to repeat scattering events at a certain rate amplifying the results of scattering of one particle .",
    "in general , the process of quantum measurement can be understood as creation of an entangled state of the measured system and the detector as a result of interaction between them .",
    "the states of the detector are classical and suppress quantum superposition of different outcomes of measurement .",
    "the two consequences of this process are the acquisition of information about the system by the detector , and `` back - action '' dephasing of the measured system - see , e.g. , @xcite . because of the system - detector entanglement , finding a given detector output provides some indication of what state the measured system is in . on the other hand ,",
    "the same entanglement means that quantum coherence among the states of the measured system is suppressed .",
    "this implies that there is a close connection between the information acquisition and back - action dephasing . in the optimal situation , the rate @xmath4 with which the detector obtains information about the system and the dephasing rate @xmath5 are the same",
    "of course , the detector can always introduce some parasitic dephasing into the system dynamics , so that in general @xmath6 . in view of this inequality , the detector with @xmath7",
    "is called `` ideal '' or `` quantum limited '' . if the detector is far from being quantum - limited , it destroys quantum coherence in the measured system long before it provides information that can be used to select specific outcomes of measurement . because of this , only the detectors that are close to being quantum - limited can give rise to non - trivial wavefunction reduction .",

    "[ fm1 ] . for the ballistic detector ,",
    "the detector - system entanglement arises as a result of scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fm1 ] ) , and the rates of information acquisition and back - action dephasing can be expressed in terms of the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "to do this , we consider evolution of the density matrix @xmath8 of the measured system in scattering of one particle . for simplicity , the hamiltonian of the system itself is assumed to be zero ( e.g. , @xmath9 in the example of fig .",
    "[ fm2 ] ) , and the system evolution is caused only by the interaction with the detector .",
    "the evolution of @xmath8 is obtained then from the time dependence of the total wavefunction of the scattered particle and the stationary wavefunction @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the initial wavefunction of the particle injected in the scattering region from the reservoir , and its time evolution @xmath12 depends on the realization @xmath0 of the potential created by the measured system .",

    "it is valid , in particular , for the qpc detector at low temperatures @xmath27 , if the injection frequency @xmath23 is taken to be equal to the `` attempt frequency '' @xmath28 with which electrons are incident on the scattering region  @xcite .    in the linear - response regime , when the changes in the scattering amplitudes with @xmath16 are small , the limiting form of eq .",

    ", the back - action dephasing is only one part of the measurement process .",
    "the other part is acquisition by the detector of information about the state of the measured system . in the case of ballistic detector ,",
    "the information is contained in the scattering amplitudes of the incident particles , and the rate of its acquisition depends on specific characteristics of the amplitudes recorded by the detector .",
    "one of the simplest possibilities in this respect , realized , e.g. , in the qpc detectors , is to record the changes in the transmission probabilities which determine the magnitude of the particle current through the scattering region .",
    "( alternatively , one could modify the scattering scheme by forcing the scattered particles to interfere , and in this way use the phase information @xcite in the scattering amplitudes . )",
    "the rate of information extraction from the current magnitude , i.e. , the rate of increase of the confidence level in distinguishing different states @xmath1 , can be calculated simply by starting with the transmission / reflection probabilities @xmath33 and @xmath34 when the measured system is in the state @xmath1 . since successive scattering event are independent ,",
    "the probability @xmath35 to have @xmath36 out of @xmath37 incident particles transmitted , is given by the binomial distribution @xmath38 .",

    "somewhat more careful consideration reminds that evolution according to the schrdinger equation is not the only way for a state of a quantum particle to change in time .",
    "changes in the particle state can also be caused by the wavefunction reduction , which , as discussed also in the introduction , can in principle violate any feature of dynamic evolution of a quantum system .",
    "this can be expressed quantitatively through the `` bell '' inequalities generalizing the classic bell s inequalities which quantify violation of the no - action - at - a - distance principle . for measurements of a mesoscopic qubit ( fig .",

    "[ fm4]b ) by changing the order of rotations : first , the @xmath103-axis rotation by @xmath107 ( opening tunneling @xmath108 for appropriate interval of time ) followed by one @xmath104-axis rotation : @xmath109    all these versions of the transformation cycle bring the qubit to its initial state ( [ e35 ] ) . in all cases , completion of the cycle that started with a shift of the wavefunction amplitudes due to the state reduction involves a part of a period of coherent oscillations which reverses this shift .",
    "coherent qubit oscillations are known to actually transfer the charge of flux between the two qubit states .",
    "since the cycle as a whole is closed , this fact shows that the changes in the qubit state caused by the wavefunction reduction can not be interpreted only as the changes in our knowledge of probabilities of the state of the qubit , but involve the actual transfer of the charge or flux in the absence of the tunneling amplitude .    to see this more quantitatively , one can derive the bell - type inequality , violation of which should show that understanding of the state reduction solely in terms of probability changes can not be correct .",
    "the inequality is obtained by assuming that the process of switching off the tunneling amplitude @xmath68 in the beginning of the transformation cycle does not leave the state ( [ e35 ] ) unchanged but instead localizes the qubit in one of the basis states .",
    "this means that the process produces an incoherent mixture of the qubit states with some , in general unspecified , probability @xmath110 to be in the state @xmath111 .",
    "this process would provide then an alternative , classical description of the evolution during the measurement process . in this description ,",
    "the qubit state is `` objectively '' well defined , but is unknown to us , and the measurement gradually provides information about this unknown state .",
    "the measurement would only change the probabilities we ascribe to the two qubit states , but not the state itself , and in particular would not transfer the charge of flux .",
    "one should then see how well this classical description can mimic the quantum result of the transformation cycle described above . a convenient way of making this comparison is provided by the probability of ending the cycle in the wrong state",
    ". the unperturbed quantum evolution should end up in the initial state @xmath69 , whereas the same transformation cycle performed on the classical initial state will always have a finite probability @xmath71 of ending in the state @xmath112 .",
    "this probability is found by applying the transformations not to the state ( [ e35 ] ) but to the incoherent state with the density matrix @xmath113 in this case , the measurement changes only the probability @xmath110 in this expression .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ e37 ] ) , if the detector gives the output @xmath36 , the density matrix of the system is @xmath114 all versions ( [ e38 ] )  ( [ e40 ] ) of the transformation cycle produce the same probability @xmath71 of being in the state @xmath112 , when applied to the density matrix @xmath115 ( [ e41 ] ) .",
    "for instance , one can see directly that in the density matrix @xmath116 obtained from @xmath115 by rotation ( [ e38 ] ) , the probability @xmath71 is : @xmath117    minimizing this expression with respect to @xmath110 , we see that the minimum probability of finding the state @xmath112 in the classical case is @xmath118 instead of looking for the minimum with respect to @xmath110 , one can adopt a natural additional assumption that when the tunneling amplitude is switched off , the qubit localization process can only be symmetric , since there is no reason to prefer one qubit state to another . in this case ,",
    "@xmath119 , and we obtain somewhat different expression for the probability @xmath71 with qualitatively similar properties : @xmath120 this expression would also be obtained if the qubit wavefunction would be reduced to the density matrix @xmath115 ( [ e41 ] ) during the measurement , not in the process of suppression of the tunneling amplitude .",
    "equations ( [ e42 ] ) and ( [ e43 ] ) show that in order to distinguish the quantum coherent evolution ( for which @xmath121 ) and incoherent evolution with non - vanishing probability @xmath71 , it is important to employ weak measurement . if the measurement is projective , i.e. if one of the probabilities @xmath122 is zero so that the measurement completely reduces the qubit state to one of the basis states , then @xmath121 and it is impossible to distinguish the two types of evolution . this conclusion should be independent of the specific form of the employed transformation cycle , since projective measurement is always expected to fully separate different components of the initial state of the measured system and completely suppress quantum coherence between them .",
    "the discussion above means that observation of the probability of the state @xmath112 smaller than @xmath71 , @xmath123 at the end of the transformation cycle proves that all transformations in this cycle , including the wavefunction reduction , are quantum coherent .",
    "combined with the non - vanishing transfer of charge or flux during the `` oscillation '' step [ ( [ e38 ] )  ( [ e40 ] ) ] of the cycle , this fact implies that the wavefunction reduction induces similar transfer across the tunnel barrier separating the qubit basis states even if the corresponding tunnel amplitude is zero .",
    "it is important to note that this counter - intuitive feature of the wavefunction reduction does not contradict the fact that all dynamic properties of the measurement , including the back - action dephasing and information rates can be calculated from the dynamic detector model without any reference to the wavefunction reduction .",
    "while the dynamic properties are average characteristics of the detector , the wavefunction reduction appears if one considers separately individual outcomes of measurement . in the transformations discussed above , this separation is achieved by introducing the feedback , operations on the measured system which depend on the specific measurement outcome . in ballistic detectors ,",
    "the measurement outcomes are distinguished by the number @xmath36 of transmitted particles , and to see the wavefunction reduction one needs to distinguish individual particles , and is done , e.g. , in the electron counting experiments @xcite . for",
    "the detectors for which distinguishing individual transmitted particles can be problematic ( e.g. , the qpc detector ) , the allowed uncertainty in @xmath36 should be smaller than the width @xmath124 of the transition region in the @xmath36-dependence of the wavefunction amplitudes of the measured qubit ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fm3 ] . since the width of this region can be estimated roughly as @xmath125 , the uncertainty in @xmath36 can be compensated for by making the difference between transmission probabilities @xmath41 smaller , thus increasing @xmath126 . the limit to this increase",
    "is set by the decoherence processes in the measured system which make it impossible to increase the measurement time of the detector beyond the coherence time of the system without losing the non - trivial character of the measurement dynamics .",
    "so far , the discussion was based on the ballistic model of the mesoscopic detector , in which the measured system controls ballistic motion of some particles between the two reservoirs ( fig .",
    "[ fm1 ] ) .",
    "if one assumes that the particle transmission probabilities are small , @xmath127 , and the transfer processes between the reservoirs can be described in the tunneling approximation , specific nature of the detector transport becomes irrelevant . in this case , the range of applicability of the detector model can be extended significantly to include the detectors in which it is not possible to identify regions of ballistic transport , but which are still based on the very similar dynamic principle : control by the measured system of transport between the two reservoirs .",
    "examples of such `` tunneling '' detectors include the superconducting set electrometer @xcite , normal set electrometer in the co - tunneling regime @xcite , or dc squid magnetometer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) used for measurements of superconducting qubits .",
    "the aim of this section is to show briefly that the measurement properties of this type of mesoscopic detectors coincide in essence with those of the ballistic detectors .",
    "since the measured system controls the tunneling amplitude @xmath128 of particles in the detector , this amplitude should be treated as a non - trivial operator acting on the measured system .",
    "the detector tunneling can be described then with the standard tunnel hamiltonian , the transfer terms in which are split into a product of operators of the measured system and the detector . in this case",
    ", the tunnel hamiltonian describes the detector - system coupling and can be written as @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the operators that describe the detector part of the tunneling dynamics , e.g. , creation of excitations in the detector reservoirs when a particle tunnels , respectively , forward and backward between them .",
    "inclusion of the operators @xmath130 means , therefore , that the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) makes it possible to describe the detectors in which the tunneling processes are strongly inelastic .",
    "this fact , however , does not prevent correct account of elastic transport in the case of ballistic detectors .",
    "qualitative reason for this can be seen easily using as an example the qpc detector .",
    "while scattering of individual electrons in the qpc is elastic , in the tunnel limit , electron transfer between the two electrodes of the qpc can also be viewed as creation of electron - hole excitation in the electrodes , with an electron removed from a state below the fermi level in one electrode , and transferred to a state above the fermi level in the other . accordingly , as we will see later , hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) leads to the evolution equations that coincide in the tunnel limit with those obtained above in the ballistic case .    under the assumption that the detector tunneling is weak",
    ", the precise form of the internal detector hamiltonian is not important and dynamics of measurement is defined by the correlators of the operators @xmath130 : @xmath131 here the angled brackets denote averaging over the detector reservoirs which are taken to be in a stationary state with some fixed number of particles in them and the density matrix @xmath132 : @xmath133 .",
    "the correlators ( [ e3 ] ) set the scale @xmath134 of the forward and backward tunneling rates in the detector .",
    "a reasonable tunneling detector should satisfy some additional assumptions related to the fact that its output should be classical in order to provide a complete measurement dynamics . similarly to the ballistic detector , the output information in the tunneling case is contained in the number @xmath36 of the particles transmitted between the detector reservoirs .",
    "for this number to behave classically , the correlators @xmath135 , @xmath136 that do not conserve the number of tunneling particles should vanish .",
    "another consequence of the assumption of classical detector output is that the energy bias @xmath137 for tunneling through the detector should be much larger than the typical energies of the measured system . in this case",
    ", one can neglect quantum fluctuations of the detector current in the relevant frequency range that corresponds to frequencies of evolution of the measured system .",
    "if one assumes in addition that all other characteristic frequencies of the detector tunneling are also much larger than those of the measured system , the functions @xmath138 , @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) are effectively @xmath140-correlated on the time scale of the system .    vanishing correlation time in the correlators ( [ e3 ] ) makes it possible to write down simple evolution equations for the density matrix @xmath8 of the measured system . to describe the system dynamics conditioned on particular outcome of measurement",
    ", we also keep in the evolution equation the number @xmath36 of particles transferred through the detector . since the correlators that do not conserve @xmath36 vanish , only the terms diagonal in @xmath36 are important . in the interaction representation with respect to the tunnel hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) , the density matrix @xmath141 is given by the standard expression : @xmath142 for @xmath140-correlated operators in eq .

( [ e6 ] ) can be solved in @xmath36 by noticing that it coincides in essence with a recurrence relations for the modified bessel functions @xmath151  @xcite . in order to interpret @xmath36 as the number of particles transferred through the detector during the time interval @xmath17",
