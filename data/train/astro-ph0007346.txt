    "the presence of numerous protostellar objects in the bright - rimmed globules inside or at the border of hii regions has been widely reported .",
    "based on the analysis of their iras colors , sugitani et al .",
    "( 1991 ) concluded that theses sources could be preferentially forming intermediate - mass stars .",
    "they suggested that star formation triggered by the radiatively - driven implosion of bright - rimmed clouds could be a very efficient mechanism , contributing up to the formation of @xmath2 of the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the few detailed studies of the molecular content and the continuum emission of protostellar cores in bright - rimmed globules have reported the presence of intermediate - mass ( aebe ) stars alone ( cernicharo et al . 1992 ) or accompanied by a cluster of low - mass stars ( megeath et al .",
    "1996 ; lefloch et al .",
    "however , hardly anything is known about the first evolutionary stages of these objects , mainly because their search is based on iras color - color diagram .",
    "hence we are led to deal with already evolved protostars which radiate a non - negligible part of their luminosity in the infrared ( sources of type i / ii in the classification of lada , 1985 ) and have typical ages of a few @xmath3 or more . also , this characterization did not consider the multiplicity of the protostellar objects in the infrared source .",
    "however , as pointed out by sugitani et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , bright - rimmed globules are found in relatively old hii regions , with ages of a few @xmath4 .",
    "these ionized regions are well - developed , with typical sizes @xmath5 , @xmath6 at typical distances of @xmath7 .",
    "the first drawback is that it is necessary to map / study huge areas in order to determine the whole protostellar content .",
    "the second drawback is that bright - rimmed globules are typically found at rather large distances from the ionizing stars and experience a reduced uv field ; hence , it is difficult to discriminate between a star formation induced by the radiatively - driven evolution of the parent core and a globule which is spontaneously evolving and has already started to form stars when it is hit by the ionization front .    with",
    "the aim of better understanding the impact of a strong uv field on star formation , and given the limitations of the previous studies , we have started a systematic multiwavelength study of a young hii region  : the trifid ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter cl98 ) .",
    "it appears as a small dusty nebula of @xmath8 diameter immersed in a large co molecular cloud ( first reported by odell , 1966 ) with a dynamical age of @xmath9 ( see sect .",
    "7.2 ) . adopting a heliocentric distance of @xmath10 ( lynds et al .",
    "1985 ) , the molecular cores on the border of the hii region lie at distances of @xmath11 from the ionizing star .",
    "this is almost 5 to 10 times closer than for the sources studied by sugitani ( 1991 ) .",
    "the nebula is excited by hd  164492a , an o7v - type star of ly - c luminosity @xmath12 ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "as can be seen from optical plates ( figure  1 ) , the southwest region of the nebula is characterized by heavy obscuration and large amounts of dust .",
    "the ionization front of the nebula impinges on a large massive cloud ( @xmath13 ) , first reported by chaisson & willson ( 1975 ) in their study of the low - density gas content of the trifid .",
    "they suggested that the cloud was undergoing a large - scale gravitational collapse and could be a nest of star formation .",
    "more direct evidence for protostellar activity in the trifid was recently shown by cl98 , who detected an herbig - haro jet emerging from a cometary globule ( dubbed tc2 ) in the southern part of the nebula ( see also rosado et al . 1999 ) .",
    "they also reported the presence of two embedded sources ( tc3 and tc4 ) in the southwest molecular cloud .",
    "we present here a detailed study of the embedded sources reported by cl98 in the southwest cloud , and show that they are similar to the protostellar cores found in the orion nebula .",
    "observations of the 1.25 mm continuum emission in the trifid were carried out in march 1996 and march 1997 at the iram 30m - telescope ( pico veleta , spain ) using the mpifr 19-channel bolometer array .",
    "the beam size of the telescope is @xmath14 .",
    "the final map was obtained by combining several individual fields , centered on the brightest condensations of the nebula .",
    "each field was scanned by moving the telescope in the azimuth direction at a speed of @xmath15 per sec and using a chopping secondary at 2hz .",
    "the throw was chosen between 35  and 60depending on the size of the structures to be mapped .",
    "subsequent azimuth scans were displaced by @xmath15 . with a sampling rate of 1/3 of a telescope beam ,",
    "higher than the nyquist frequency , we achieve an angular resolution of one half telescope beam ( 6 ) .",
    "we adopted the coordinates of the central star as determined from hipparcos  : @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the weather conditions were good and rather stable during the two observing sessions .",
    "the final map yields an rms of @xmath18  beam .",
    "hence , it is sensitive enough to detect at the @xmath19 level condensations of @xmath20 in one @xmath14 telescope beam ( @xmath21 at the distance of the trifid ) .    in july 1996 and 1997",
    ", we mapped the whole nebula and the surrounding molecular gas with the iram 30m - telescope over an area of @xmath22 at full sampling , using the on - the - fly technique in the millimeter lines of co and @xmath23 , and in the @xmath24 transition .",
    "the technical details and the full maps will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming paper ( lefloch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "complementary observations with the 30 m telescope were performed in the @xmath25 ,  and lines of sio and cs to trace the dense molecular gas in the direction of the main condensations detected in co and in the continuum maps .",
    "all the lines were observed with a spatial sampling of @xmath26 and a velocity resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "we present here the data in the region of the southwestern cloud ( figure  1 ) . as the trifid transits at low - elevation at pico veleta ,",
    "pointing was checked every hour and corrections were always lower than @xmath28 .",
    "the ir emission of the dust cores was observed with the instruments on the infrared space observatory iso ( see cl98 for details ) .",
    "we present here the data obtained with isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) at 3  resolution , taken with the lw10 filter ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and based on the most recent data reduction ( pipeline 7 ) .",
    "the images were corrected for field deformation .",
    "the noise in the region of the dust cores is @xmath31 pixel ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the isocam image was positioned in right ascension and declination in two steps . in a first step , we took two optical images , one in @xmath33 with the iac80 telescope ( observatorio del teide , tenerife , spain ) , and one in the [ sii ] @xmath34 lines with the nordic optical telescope ( not ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) (",
    "these images are shown in cl98 ) .",
    "their astrometry was performed by identifying the sources reported on the tycho catalog .",
    "the positional errors are less than @xmath35 . in a second step ,",
    "the optical sources with a counterpart in the @xmath36 band were used to position the isocam image .",
    "we found an agreement over the whole maps better than @xmath37 .",
    "we have observed the dust continuum emission towards one dust core ( tc4 ) between 43 and @xmath38 with the lws spectrometer in grating mode .",
    "the spectral resolution of the lws was 0.6@xmath39 for @xmath40 greater than @xmath41 and 0.3@xmath39 below ( r= 150/300 ) .",
    "the size of the lws beam ( hpfw ) is known to vary from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , depending on the detector ( e.  caux , priv .",
    "comm . ) . in this work",
    ", we assume a gaussian beam of @xmath43 hpfw .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 a map of the 1.25 mm continuum emission in the trifid nebula , superposed on an @xmath33 image taken with the iac80 telescope ( see cl98 for details ) , and the location of the southwestern cloud where the embedded sources were discovered . a magnified view , displayed on fig .  2 ,",
    "shows the dust thermal emission of two strongly peaked condensations ( dubbed tc3 and tc4 ) at offset positions ( -246 , -221 ) and ( -150,-246 ) respectively . to the southeast of tc4",
    "we detect two faint and smaller condensations ( dubbed tc4b and tc4c ) at offset positions ( -126 , -300 ) and ( -90 , -320 ) .",
    "the tc4-tc4c condensations lay in a dust lane of @xmath44 width ( 0.33 ) and @xmath45 length ( 1.3 ) , at a projected distance of @xmath46 from the exciting star of the nebula .",
    "the dust lane is essentially adjacent to the ionized gas region , as traced by the @xmath33 emission , and constitutes one of the several fragments of a shell which bounds the hii region .",
    "we note however a small overlap between the dust lane and the ionized region .",
    "the geometry of the cores with respect to the nebula is analyzed in more detail in sect .",
    "the sources have sizes ( estimated from the @xmath47 contour in the millimeter flux map and after beam deconvolution ) of 0.11  and 0.16for tc4c and tc4b respectively , and 0.2  for tc4 and tc3 , with a smooth flux distribution down to 6  ( 0.05  at the distance of the trifid ) .",
    "they are well resolved by the 11  beam of the 30 m telescope though only marginally in the case of tc4b - tc4c .",
    "the peak flux of the dust cores is 0.39  jy/11  beam and 0.29  jy/11  beam for tc3 and tc4 respectively .",
    "based on the analysis of the far - infrared continuum emission of tc4 , we estimate a dust temperature of @xmath48 and a dust spectral index @xmath49 ( see below ) .",
    "since our millimeter mapping shows a large similarity between the tc3 and tc4 , we also applied these dust parameters to derive the properties of tc3 . adopting a dust opacity @xmath50 at @xmath51 , and integrating over the @xmath47 contour level",
    ", we derive core masses ranging from @xmath52 ( for tc4c ) to @xmath53 ( for tc3 ) .",
    "the hydrogen column densities estimated at the flux peak of the cores range from 0.6 to @xmath54 ( see table  [ core ] ) . assuming a `` normal '' extinction ratio this corresponds to visual extinctions @xmath55 between 34 ( tc4c ) and 192 ( tc3 ) .",
    "if we adopt the `` anomalous '' extinction ratio @xmath56 ( derived by lynds , canzian & oneil ( 1985 ) from @xmath33 and @xmath57 measurements of the trifid ) we obtain even higher visual extinctions , in the range 60  325 .",
    "the physical properties of the cores are summarized in table  [ core ] .",
    "tc3 appears to be immersed in an extended envelope of low - emissivity .",
    "this envelope is elongated in the north - south direction , and has a typical size of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , defined from the contour level at @xmath60 in the degraded map ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the flux distribution appears somewhat irregular ( `` clumpy '' ) , exhibiting two other small condensations close to tc3 .",
    "assuming the same dust physical properties for the envelope as for tc3 we derive a total mass of @xmath61 .",
    "the low angular resolution and sensitivity of iras provided only poorly contrasted images of the trifid .",
    "subsequently , it also failed in detecting point sources in the nebula .",
    "we show in figure  3 a view of the tc3-tc4 region observed with isocam at @xmath36 ( lw10 filter ) and a pixel size of @xmath37 .",
    "we detect a diffuse extended component of flux ranging between 70 and @xmath62 .",
    "the rms of the map in the region is @xmath63 , or @xmath64 in a @xmath37 pixel .",
    "the region of minimum emissivity coincides with the dense molecular gas layers at the border of the nebula .",
    "we also find evidence for a few point - like sources in the surrounding of tc3 and tc4 .",
    "these ir sources probably correspond to newly born stars , formed in the large burst which accompanied the formation of the nebula .",
    "in the southern part of the tc3 envelope , two objects are apparent at offset positions ( -257,-326 ) and ( -248,-300 ) .",
    "close to tc4 , we discovered two sources , unnoticed previously  : the first one lies at the offset position ( -152,-205 ) and the second one lies @xmath65 north of the tc4 dust peak , at the offset position ( -148,-237 ) .",
    "the latter has a peak flux of @xmath66 and an integrated flux of @xmath67 .",
    "it is marginally resolved by isocam  : we estimate a size of @xmath37 ( 0.024 ) , comparable to the angular resolution of the observations .",
    "the distance between the ir point source and the tc4 dust peak is comparable to the relative position uncertainties of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 maps , hence we can not exclude that , instead of originating from another object on a closeby line - of - sight , this emission could be associated with the tc4 dust peak . in agreement with cl98",
    ", we find only a smooth flux distribution and no point - like emission towards tc3 .",
    "the far - infrared emission towards tc4 was observed with the lws spectrometer in the range @xmath70 , in the course of a one - dimensional raster across the nebula ( not shown here ) .",
    "the emission line spectrum of tc4 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is dominated by atomic and ionic lines ( oi , oiii , nii , niii , cii ) , excited mainly in the photon - dominated region ( pdr ) and the ionized gas of the nebula ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "in particular , even the co rotational transition of lowest energy accessible at @xmath71 remains undetected .",
    "this stresses the fact that the line emission originates from a cold molecular component .",
    "we used the lws data to build the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of tc4 , in order to estimate the dust physical conditions in the region .",
    "three terms contribute to the flux collected in the direction of tc4  : the tc4 core , the pdr and the hii region .",
    "we first derive a lower limit to the sed by estimating and subtracting the contributions of the extended components , i.e. the pdr and the hii region to the flux collected towards the tc4 core .",
    "these two contributions were estimated from observing a reference position located on the eastern side of the nebula  : @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this position was chosen because all the maps of various molecular tracers indicated only very weak or no emission at all in this direction .",
    "the raster shows only weak variation of the emission in the range @xmath74 over the nebula , irrespective of the presence of molecular gas on the line of sight .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the emission between 45 and @xmath41 rather originates from the hii region and the pdr .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the contribution of the hii region and the pdr are much overestimated and it gives us confidence in the procedure followed .",
    "we can not exclude however that a small mid - infrared contribution originating from some warm material within the tc4 core itself might have been missed through this procedure .",
    "after subtracting the contribution of the pdr and the hii region , the overall emission from tc4 can be satisfactorily fitted by a modified black - body with an opacity law @xmath75 , for a hydrogen column density @xmath76 and a dust temperature @xmath77 .",
    "figure  4 shows that the fit is well constrained by the data .",
    "some deviation is observed at @xmath78 .",
    "this excess probably arises from the contribution of the photon - dominated region and the isocam sources .",
    "interestingly , the distribution peak appears to lay longwards of @xmath79 ; more measurements , especially in the submillimeter regime would help to better determine the dust properties in the far - infrared range .",
    "integrating under the fit to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , we derive a bolometric luminosity of @xmath80 for tc4 .",
    "this value is probably a lower limit as discussed above .",
    "an upper limit to the bolometric luminosity can be obtained by fitting the emission of the full unsubtracted lws spectrum the emission between 45 and @xmath81 can be reproduced quite closely by assuming the lws beam to be filled by two components , modeled as a modified black - body  : a cold component of column density @xmath82 at 20  k with a spectral dust index @xmath49 , and a warmer component of lower column density @xmath83 , at 40  k , with @xmath84 , typical of the dust emission in the mid - ir ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "integrating under the fit ( fig  4 ) , we obtained a total luminosity @xmath85 .",
    "as a conclusion , the bolometric luminosity of tc4 lies in the range @xmath86 .    as the bolometer bandpass is @xmath87  ghz , and adopting a bolometric luminosity @xmath88 , we derive a ratio @xmath89 ; such low values are typical of young protostars ( see e.g. andr et al .",
    "1993 ) and indicate that a non - negligible fraction of the mass is still to be accreted from the envelope .",
    "the nature of tc3 and tc4 is further discussed in sect .",
    "we first examine the overall geometry of the dust cores tc3-tc4 with respect to the hii region , by analyzing the kinematics of the molecular material and its distribution with respect to the ionized gas .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show that the dust lane containing the dense cores tc3-tc4 _ partly _ overlaps with the ionized gas region .",
    "the high visual extinction of the cores and the dust lane implies that they are located behind the ionized region , on the rear side of the nebula .",
    "the southern part of the tc3 envelope appears free of any @xmath33 emission , hence must lay below the border of the hii region .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the molecular gas kinematics .",
    "the mapping of the molecular emission shows very complex profiles in the low - density gas , as traced by co ( fig .",
    "5 ; lefloch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the spectra display numerous kinematic components in the range @xmath90\\,\\kms$ ] , most of them of low column density . from a comparison with an optical image of the nebula ( fig .  1 )",
    ", we found that some of this material is seen in absorption against the hii region as the well - known `` arms '' of the trifid .",
    "the material on the front side has a velocity @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 .",
    "there is hardly any molecular emission between 10 and @xmath93 . at higher velocities , between 15 and @xmath94 ,",
    "one finds again large column densities of material , over the area of the optical nebula .",
    "the material on the rear side emits at velocities larger than @xmath93 , in agreement with an expanding motion for the hii region .",
    "the molecular emission of the tc3-tc4 cores peaks at velocities @xmath95 , somewhat larger than the mean velocity of the rear side of the nebula . some molecular transitions , like the co  line ( see fig .  5 )",
    ", are absorbed between 5 and @xmath96 .",
    "this velocity range implies that the absorbing material is located on the front side of the nebula .",
    "the low - density gas was already studied by chaisson & willson ( 1975 ) in some lines of h@xmath97co ( angular resolution of 6.6 ) and oh ( angular resolution of 18 ) .",
    "they found a maximum of emission coinciding with the southwestern molecular cloud .",
    "they reported a broadening of the lines and a velocity gradient towards the cloud center , where tc3 and tc4 are found , which they suggested as evidence of gravitational collapse .",
    "the region of tc3 and tc4 was mapped in the millimeter lines of cs .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 a map of the main - beam brightness temperatures detected in the @xmath98 line .",
    "we found two centrally peaked condensations centered on the continuum flux peaks of the tc3 and tc4 cores .",
    "the lines are relatively bright with typical intensities of 1 - 2  k in all three transitions . towards the center , the line profiles exhibit broad wings which are the signature of bipolar outflows whose properties are studied in sect .",
    "the linewidths of the three transitions range between @xmath99 ( tc3 ) and @xmath100 ( tc4 ) and are larger than the lines observed in the low - density gas traced by ( @xmath101 ) , especially in the direction of the tc4 .",
    "however , as discussed in sect .  5 , this apparent broadening could be due to the geometry of the outflows powered by the protostars .    in tc4 , the emission peaks at @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "the half - power contour delineates a round condensation of @xmath103 diameter ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the @xmath105 line was detected at a few positions towards the center of the dust core .",
    "we derived the temperature , @xmath106 volume density and cs column density in the condensation peak from a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) analysis of the three lines , using the collisional rates of green & chapman ( 1978 ) . in the central region ,",
    "the lower @xmath25 and @xmath98 transitions are mainly sensitive to the gas column density ; hence these two lines do not constrain very severely the density and the temperature .",
    "we found as `` best solution '' a kinetic temperature of 20  k ( in good agreement with the determination from the sed ) , an @xmath106 volume density @xmath107 and a column density @xmath108 . in the outer parts ,",
    "the   density and the cs column density were determined from the @xmath25 and @xmath98 lines .",
    "we find little variations in the values derived across the core .",
    "integrating over the hpfw contour and assuming an abundance @xmath109= 10^{-9}$ ] , we obtain a total mass @xmath110 , a value in very good agreement with the estimate from the dust millimeter observations .    in tc3 , the  emission reveals a flattened condensation of @xmath111 ( @xmath112 , after beam - deconvolution ) . unlike tc4 ,",
    "the emission of the @xmath105 line is unresolved and coincides with the peak of 1.25 mm continuum core , where we detect some bright emission ( @xmath113 ) ; only some weak emission is detected elsewhere .",
    "the linewidths ( hpfw ) are @xmath114 , narrower than in the tc4 condensation ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the  line profiles are double - peaked in the center and east of tc3 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "one of the peaks is centered at the velocity of the tc4 core ( @xmath116 ) whereas the other one is centered at @xmath117 ( fig .",
    "the first component is spatially distributed between tc4 and tc3 . in the higher  transition , the emission is centered at @xmath117 , similar to what is observed in other molecular tracers like sio , which are more indicative of protostellar activity .",
    "this shows that the  line is not self - absorbed but that we detect a second component .",
    "based on its velocity and its spatial distribution , the latter appears to be nothing else but the gas layer containing tc4 superposed on the red wing of the tc3 outflow , which produces the bright emission observed .",
    "we find for this layer typical densities of @xmath118 and column densities n(cs)@xmath119 . towards the tc3 core ,",
    "we derive physical properties rather similar to those reigning in tc4 . at the brightness peak , we find a kinetic temperature of 20  k , a density @xmath120 and a column density @xmath121 . in the envelope",
    ", we find densities @xmath122 out to @xmath123 north of the tc3 peak .",
    "however , only @xmath26 south of tc3 , the density has already decreased to @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , we note a decrease from @xmath125 to @xmath126 in the column densities as one moves away from the tc3 peak . integrating the column densities over the hpfw contour and adopting a cs abundance @xmath127= 10^{-9}$ ] , we derive a mass @xmath128 .",
    "the above mass determinations are affected by the uncertainties on the cs abundance in the trifid nebula .",
    "the comparison with the results from the 1.25 mm continuum observations is very satisfying in the case of tc4 , but there is a noticeable discrepancy between both estimates in the case of tc3 .",
    "a simple calculation of the core virial mass based on the extent of the cs emission and the non - thermal   linewidth yields a value of @xmath129 and @xmath130 for tc3 and tc4 respectively .",
    "the three mass estimates of the tc4 core ( millimeter continuum , cs , virial ) agree quite well .",
    "the situation is more contrasted in the case of tc3 .",
    "the kinetic support against gravity was not estimated from the cs linewidths for the reasons explained above .",
    "instead , it was calculated from the @xmath24 line .",
    "thanks to its low opacity and its lower critical density ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) , the @xmath24 transition probes larger amounts of ambient material in and around the cores and their envelope , without being too much sensitive to the outflowing gas .",
    "this is illustrated by the line profiles displayed on fig .",
    "5  : unlike co , cs and sio , the  line does not display any strong high - velocity wing . hence",
    ", this linewidth is a better tracer of the non - thermal motions in the regions considered here .    in order to estimate the physical conditions in the molecular gas surrounding the tc3-tc4 condensations",
    ", we also observed the position @xmath131 , inside the gas filament on which the trifid impinges and detected in the  line ( see below ) .",
    "we found a weak  line of @xmath132  k , and set an upper limit of 0.15  k to the @xmath98 line . from the line ratio ,",
    "we derive an upper limit to the  density of @xmath133 , and an average cs column density @xmath134 .",
    "the picture drawn by the  emission is very different from the high - density gas tracers like  or cs .",
    "the bulk of the emission is comprised in the velocity range @xmath135 .",
    "the lines are bright ( @xmath136 of a few k ) and rather broad ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "figure  7 shows the @xmath24 emission integrated in channels of @xmath138 between 17.5 and @xmath139 .    in the velocity interval",
    "where the dense gas was observed -as traced by the cs lines- ( @xmath140 ) , there is no clear large - scale condensation centered on the tc3 and tc4 dust peaks .",
    "we detect a local maximum centered on tc4 and a condensation where tc3 peaks at its apex .",
    "we note however a good agreement between the  emission and the 1.25 mm continuum map when the resolution of the latter is degraded to @xmath141 .",
    "also , the gas column densities derived under the lte hypothesis , assuming an excitation temperature of 20  k , a standard abundance of @xmath142 ( cernicharo & gulin 1987 ) and optically thin lines , agree within a factor of 2 with the estimates from the dust emission , except in the central region of the cores .",
    "we find that the column densities derived from the line measurements tend to be lower than those derived from the dust emission .",
    "the discrepancy is more and more pronounced in the densest layers of the core , up to a factor of 5 at the peak of tc3 .",
    "at this position , we estimate a `` degraded '' continuum flux of @xmath143 in one @xmath141 beam , which corresponds to a column density @xmath144 . adopting the same density and temperature as for the dense cores ,",
    "an lvg calculation gives an opacity @xmath145 for the transition .",
    "the low opacity of the @xmath24 line suggests that the discrepancy could be the signature of molecular depletion onto the dust grains .",
    "we note that in the protostellar cores of other star - forming regions ( e.g. iras4a and iras2 in ngc1333 , lefloch et al .",
    "1998 ) where evidences of molecular depletion have been reported , larger discrepancies are found .",
    "observations at higher angular resolution could help clarify this point .    on larger scales",
    ", the mapping of the region in the  and co lines shows that the gas emission is distributed in a very long filament on the rear side of the nebula , which stretches far away from it .",
    "this emission arises at lower velocities than those of the protostellar cores and can be seen on figure  7 in the range @xmath146 .",
    "the morphology of the filament is very conspicuous in that it seems to change in direction and bend around the tc3-tc4 cores , leaving a `` hole '' at their location .",
    "it is actually the whole layer detected in the dust millimeter emission and housing the tc4-tc4c condensations which is unambiguously separated from the filament .",
    "the border of the filament around the cores is characterized by stronger gradients in the brightness map , especially at the northwest of the tc3 condensation .",
    "we estimated the  column densities in the filament with the assumption of optically thin lines in the lte regime .",
    "we find low values of the order of @xmath147 .",
    "we mapped the dust core region in the sio  line as this molecule is a good tracer of the outflowing gas of young and/or massive protostellar sources .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] a map of the sio   velocity - integrated emission .",
    "we detected in the three millimeter sio lines two compact bipolar outflows centered on the tc3 and tc4 dust peaks at the velocities @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively .",
    "however , due to lack of time , only a few positions could be observed in the higher  and   transitions .",
    "we found that the wings cover a total velocity range of 70  ( from -10 to @xmath150 ) in both sources ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . towards tc3 ,",
    "the wings have a size ( beam deconvolved ) of 35(0.28 ) , and their centroids are separated by 15 , nearly one telescope beam at 2 mm .",
    "the line profiles are typical of young high - velocity outflows  : a narrow line core with some low brightness emission at high - velocity ( see left panel of fig .",
    "5 ) . towards tc4 ,",
    "the wings have a similar size but fully overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , indicating that the outflow is oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "such a geometry implies that the column densities of accelerated material along the line of sight are larger ; adding their contribution to the ambient material results in broader and more complex profiles .",
    "indeed , the line profiles are broader in tc4 than in tc3  : @xmath99 versus @xmath100 for the cs  line",
    ". this effect can be seen also on the sio  profile on fig .",
    "5 . in any case , given the compactness of the tc3 and tc4 outflows , they are probably very young . from the extent of the wings we estimate a kinematical age of @xmath151 , a value typical for class 0 sources .",
    "we first estimated the physical conditions in the gas from an lvg analysis of the three transitions .",
    "the cs collision rates were adopted for the sio molecule .",
    "we used a velocity width of 4 corresponding to the core of the lines .",
    "we attempted to determine the density , column density and kinetic temperature at the central position of tc3 and tc4 .",
    "the temperature and density determinations are somewhat uncertain as the  and  are mostly sensitive to the column density .",
    "we found that the kinetic temperature which best allows to reproduce the brightness temperatures is definitely above 40  k and close to 60  k. we adopted this value as the gas kinetic temperature in the derivation of the outflows parameters . for kinetic temperatures @xmath152 in the range 20 - 80  k",
    ", we find that the density , as determined from the @xmath105 and @xmath98 lines , is comprised between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and the column density @xmath155 . in this regime ,",
    "the opacity @xmath156 varies in the range 0.02 - 0.05 , so that the  line is optically thin .",
    "the excitation temperature of the line varies between @xmath157  k for a kinetic temperature @xmath158 , to @xmath159  k for @xmath160  k ; the line is thermalized only at low temperatures .",
    "the same conclusions hold for tc4 , where we find a slightly lower column density n(sio)@xmath161 .    towards the central position , we estimated the gas density in the wings from the ratio of the @xmath162 brightness temperatures .",
    "the results are consistent with an analysis done on the @xmath163 ratio but it offers the advantage of a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we find that the line ratio does not depend very much on the velocity ; it varies in the range 1.1 - 1.4 for tc3 and 1.2 - 1.4 for tc4 .",
    "this corresponds to densities in the range @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively , for a kinetic temperature in the interval of 20 - 80  k. these densities are of the same order as in the surrounding molecular gas , as determined from the cs lines .",
    "since the excitation temperature of  line does not vary too much in the range of kinetic temperatures considered , and the line is optically thin , we adopted an average value @xmath166 in order to derive the large - scale properties of the outflows in the lte regime . we did not correct for the inclination of the outflows with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "as discussed above , the adopted excitation temperature is probably accurate only within 50% .",
    "however , we believe it is well representative of the physical conditions in the outflowing gas . hence , we derived the sio abundance in the high - velocity gas from comparison of the co and sio column densities in the red wing of tc3 .",
    "as can be seen on fig .  5 , the co red wing appears to be free from contamination by the ambient molecular cloud for @xmath167 . at the typical densities encountered in the outflows ,",
    "the co millimeter lines are thermalized and we adopted an excitation temperature of 60  k for the  line .",
    "we also assumed a standard co abundance of @xmath168 .",
    "we derived @xmath169\\simeq 2\\times 10^{-8}$ ] , a value rather high and typical of very young high - velocity flows ( lefloch et al .",
    "1998 ) , that we used to estimate the outflows parameters .",
    "we find total masses of 1.1 and @xmath170 , mechanical energies of @xmath171 and luminosities of 1.2 and @xmath172 for the tc3 and tc4 outflows respectively .",
    "the physical parameters are summarized in table  [ outflow ] .",
    "both outflows appear very similar under the reasonable assumptions that their sio abundance and temperature are not too different .",
    "our continuum observations show the presence of an extended cold envelope around protostars tc3 and tc4 .",
    "however , we can not exclude the presence of a warm component unresolved by the beam of the iram 30 m telescope , since it gives only access to spatial structures larger than @xmath173 at the distance of the trifid ( 1.68 ) .",
    "actually , observations of high - mass protostars in orion reveal the presence of a hot core in these sources , a dense component with a size of @xmath174 and a temperature of 70 - 100  k ( see table  2 ) .    such component would remain unresolved in our continuum millimeter observations ; moreover , its contribution could have been ignored when we derived the far - infrared emission of tc4 from the lws spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "the angular resolution and the sensitivity of our @xmath175 m isocam map are high enough to constrain the temperature of this warm component .",
    "our @xmath175 m map shows one source with a size of @xmath176 which could coincide with the tc4 dust peak taking into account the positional uncertainties .",
    "we now assess if the isocam fluxes measured towards the region are compatible with the presence of a warm core embedded in a cold gas envelope of column density similar to the peak value derived from the 1.25 mm continuum observations .",
    "the column density of the cold component could be higher than the estimates at the 1.25 mm flux peak but it seems unlikely that it be _ much _ higher .",
    "we also assumed that the warm source lies approximately at the center of the envelope .",
    "the absorption by the cold component was estimated from the visual extinctions derived towards tc3-tc4 ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) , assuming an average extinction ratio @xmath177 for the lw10 band , based on the values tabulated by savage & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "applying this procedure to the tc4 region , it comes out that an optically thick black - body of @xmath178 diameter ( 0.02 ) at a temperature @xmath179 provides a flux @xmath180 at 12@xmath181 m , compatible with the @xmath67 source detected close to the millimeter dust peak . in the case of tc3",
    ", there is no indication of a point - like source down to @xmath64 per @xmath37 pixel .",
    "this sets an upper limit of @xmath182 for the warm ( optically thick ) component .",
    "these simple estimates show that the presence of a hot core in tc4 is likely if the physical association with the @xmath69 is real .",
    "the situation is less clear for tc3 , and complementary observations in various molecular transitions could help determine more accurately the temperature towards the peak of the condensation .",
    "confirming the absence of a gas component significantly warmer than the tc3 envelope would mean that the central source is a true massive protostar .",
    "it is interesting however that both tc3 and tc4 are still deeply embedded in large amounts of cold dense material . together with the young kinematical age of the outflows ,",
    "this is suggestive of an early evolutionary age .",
    "the jeans length is @xmath183 in the cores of tc3 and tc4  : the presence of subcomponents in both cores is therefore possible in principle .",
    "however , the absence of apparent substructure down to @xmath173 ( one half telescope beam at 1.25 mm ) makes the presence of more than a few unresolved components in our observations very unlikely .",
    "this does not alter our conclusions about the high mass of the protostellar cores in the trifid .",
    "comparison with other protostellar sources is somewhat hampered by the relatively large distance to the trifid , as compared to the star - forming regions where the youngest protostars have been found until now . the difference in size between tc3-tc4 and other protostellar sources ( typically a factor 3 to 5 ) comes from the fact that we take into account the contribution of the extended envelope .",
    "for instance , the cepe protostellar condensation has a size of @xmath184 ( lefloch et al .",
    "tc3 and tc4 are more massive and brighter than most of the class  0 sources known to date ( bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "their masses are more than one order of magnitude larger than the typical sources vla1623 , l1448-mm ( see table  1 ) .",
    "they appear also more massive than most of the protostars discovered by chini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in orion towards the omc-2 and omc-3 cores .",
    "the luminosity of tc4 compares well with the young intermediate - mass protostar ngc  7129-firs2 ( eiroa et al .",
    "however the more massive envelope of tc3-tc4 and their lower mean core temperature ( @xmath48 versus @xmath185 for ngc7129 ) suggests an earlier evolutionary age . on the contrary ,",
    "the similarity of the physical properties between the outflows of tc3-tc4 and the sources studied by shepherd & churchwell ( 1996 ) , as well as the bolometric luminosity of tc4 ( comparable to a @xmath186 star ) , strongly suggests that the trifid protostars could be intermediate - mass objects .",
    "it is interesting to compare the line intensities of some high - density tracers like cs of sio with what is observed in the massive cores of orion . neglecting the structure of the emitting regions , a rough estimate for the expected cs and sio lines",
    "is provided by directly scaling the peak main - beam temperatures observed towards tc3 and tc4 at the distance of orion ( @xmath187 ) . as a result",
    ", the cs lines observed in tc3 would appear similar to those measured towards the massive cores detected of mundy et al .",
    "( 1986 ) in the omc1 region ( see table  [ compar ] ) .",
    "similarly , the millimeter sio lines would be @xmath188 whereas martin - pintado ( 1998 ) has detected lines of @xmath189 in the irc2 core .",
    "therefore , the central protostars in tc3 and tc4 look similar to the orion protostellar cores . on the other hand ,",
    "the trifid cores are still deeply embedded in some material much colder than the orion nebula . presumably , the parental medium has not yet been warmed up neither by the uv radiation of the exciting star , nor by the central sources .",
    "the tc3 and tc4 cores appear to be in a `` pre - orion '' stage , characteristic of the early evolution of a nascent hii region  : the massive forming protostars are still deeply embedded in very cold material , before eventually converting into the massive and warm cores now observed in the fully developed orion nebula .",
    "we examine in this section the possibility of a triggered formation for the protostellar cores through the onset of instabilities in the molecular gas surrounding the hii region .",
    "the efficiency of an instability depends on its characteristic growth rate , which obviously has to be compatible with the age of the nebula in order to perturb the overall stability of the gas .",
    "we first precise the dynamical age of the trifid nebula before turning to the observational evidence for a triggered formation scenario and confront our observations with the predictions of a simple model .",
    "the size of the nebula suggests its expansion is only very recent .",
    "it has a radius of @xmath190 , approximately 5 times the radius of the stromgren sphere created by the exciting star ( we assume a mean density of @xmath191 in the parental cloud , determined from the analysis of the large - scale co emission , lefloch et al .",
    "2000 ) . from the time - radius relation for evolved hii regions ,",
    "we infer an early dynamical age of 0.3 - 0.4  myr for the trifid .",
    "this agrees with the relatively high electron density measured  : 150  ( lynds et al .",
    "1985 ) versus 10 - 20  in the rosette nebula ( celnik 1985 ) .",
    "however , taking into account the duration of the ultra - compact hii phase undergone by the exciting star hd164492a , more difficult to quantify but probably of the order of a few @xmath3 , the nebula is probably older and the expansion phase could have lasted already long enough to leave ample time for condensations to collapse and form protostars .      from our observations , tc3 and tc4 are deeply embedded in a layer of dense gas and high - column density . when examining the morphology of the layer containing the tc4-tc4b - tc4c cores",
    ", we see that it is not much wider than the dust cores , with a typical length - to - width ratio of @xmath192 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "it is suggestive of a layer which would have fragmented into three condensations separated by @xmath193 .",
    "the high - density gas observations draw the picture of a gas layer rather uniform with a few condensations .",
    "the gas column densities derived from cs and  appear rather uniform across the gas  : the variations observed between the protostellar cores and the ambient gas not more than a factor of 2 - 3 . for  densities on the contrary ,",
    "the differences are much more pronounced  : typically one order of magnitude .",
    "the emission of the dense gas detected appears to trace fragments of a larger shell surrounding the ionized bubble ( cl98 ) .",
    "moreover the layer is spatially anticorrelated with the ambient gas , which is hardly detected in the high - density gas and column density tracers .",
    "these observations provide evidence that the molecular layer consists of some gas compressed and accelerated to a few @xmath194 in the pre - cursor shock associated with the ionization front .    in the early stages of the expansion of the hii region ,",
    "the self - gravity of the molecular gas layer is negligible and the latter is confined by the external ( thermal or ram ) pressure of the surrounding medium .",
    "as the layer builds up with some compressed material , self - gravity starts to compete with the external pressure .",
    "this configuration is favorable to its fragmentation through the triggering of `` rayleigh - taylor - like '' or `` jeans - like '' instabilities .",
    "accordingly , the tc3-tc4c may have formed from the fragmentation of the compressed layer .    in the molecular gas layers containing tc3 and tc4 the linewidths are much larger than what is observed in the taurus cloud for instance ( @xmath195 versus @xmath138 ) where kinetic temperatures of the same order can be found .",
    "several authors have studied the stability of a thin plane - parallel gas layer confined by external pressure and self - gravity ( see e.g. elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ; vishniac 1983 ; elmegreen 1989 ; whitworth et al .",
    "1994a , b ) . the results vary somewhat depending on the assumed boundary conditions but show in all cases that the first growing modes are purely hydrodynamical . in particular , maclow & norman ( 1992 ) showed that the overstable modes which arise in the layer do not fragment it but generate some weak transverse shocks which can , in turn , generate some weak turbulence .",
    "it is therefore tempting to interpret these large non - thermal motions as the result of the turbulence generated in the shocked gas as the shell expands .",
    "previous work on the fragmentation of a compressed gas layer has shown the existence of two fast self - gravitating modes , a `` slow '' one on a timescale @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the density of the ambient molecular cloud @xmath198 , and a `` fast '' one on a timescale @xmath199 where m is the mach number of the shocked layer relative to the effective sound - speed in the layer . in the case of the trifid",
    ", the slowest mode has a typical timescale @xmath200 , hence can not be efficient enough to trigger the condensation of the compressed layer and allow the formation of protostars .    as can be seen on fig .  7",
    ", the velocity of the ambient gas surrounding the compressed layer is @xmath201 , whereas the velocity of the compressed layer containing tc4 - 4c is @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , we adopt a typical expansion velocity of @xmath203 and an effective sound speed @xmath204 of @xmath205 in the shocked layer ( the typical linewidth is @xmath195 from our  observations )  : we derive @xmath206 and a timescale of @xmath207 .",
    "this compares well to the age of the nebula , so that the fast instability could be efficient enough to trigger the `` jeans - collapse '' of the gas layer ( whitworth et al .",
    "1994a , b ) .",
    "we now estimate the physical parameters of the fragments which would form .",
    "the distance between two fragments is @xmath208 , and their mass is @xmath209 .",
    "the density in the shell is expected to be @xmath210 @xmath211 .",
    "the typical fragment mass varies like @xmath212 , hence even a difference of a factor of 2 - 3 with the mass of tc4b and tc4c can be regarded as satisfactory .",
    "although the derivation of all these figures is subject to the uncertainties in the actual values of the parameters , the good agreement between the predicted properties of the fragments and the observational constraints from the properties of tc3-tc4c and the dynamical age of the trifid is intriguing .",
    "if the instability studied here would have triggered the formation of tc3-tc4c , one would expect the velocity of the protostellar fragments to be close to that of the compressed layer , and differ somewhat from that of the unperturbed surrounding gas , possibly up to a few @xmath194 .",
    "this is indeed observed towards tc3-tc4 . as a conclusion",
    ", we can not exclude that all the cores reported here might be the result of a spontaneous process rather than the fragmentation of the compressed layer in which they were found .",
    "there is no clear and direct evidence that the protostellar cores did form from the fragmentation of that layer .",
    "however , all the predictions about the physical properties of the fragments which can be made without a detailed modeling of the trifid ( mass , size , velocity ) fully agree with our observations . these are therefore good indications that such mechanism could be at work , and that the formation of the protostars would have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula .",
    "the indications of star formation inside tc3 and tc4 suggest that they are the cocoons of the most recent generation of stars of the nebula .",
    "the physical conditions imply a typical jeans mass @xmath213 , which is comparable to the mass of tc3 and tc4 .",
    "we speculate that the other cores tc4b - c and the subcondensations found in the envelope of tc3 , smaller and less massive , are still in a pre - stellar stage , on the verge of collapsing .",
    "we have indirect evidences that other stellar births took place in the trifid through the detection with isocam of a hot dust component of 2 - 3  in size which coincides spatially with 2 ultra - compact hii regions of b - type stars at only @xmath214 from the exciting star of the trifid ( lefloch et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although more work is needed to establish their nature , the point - like sources detected close to the tc3 and tc4 cores in the @xmath215 m image are probably some other newly born stars of the nebula .",
    "tc3 and tc4 are the most recent events of a process which started with the formation of the exciting star of the trifid .",
    "altogether these observations suggest a continuous star forming process occuring on a scale large enough to encompass the nebula , rather than a sequential process .",
    "although compatible with a triggered formation scenario , our observations do not enable us to determine whether tc3 and tc4 were in a quiescent stage before being hit by the shock wave , and subsequently started to collapse , or if they were already on the path to form stars .",
    "however , they show in a rather unambiguous way massive protostellar cores undergoing shock compression .",
    "high - angular observations are required to get more insight on this interaction and how severely the collapse can be perturbed .",
    "we have observed at millimeter and far - infrared wavelengths the molecular condensation on the southwestern border of the trifid nebula , a young hii region .",
    "mapping of the dust thermal emission at 1.25 mm reveals several massive condensations ( between 8 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "these condensations are made of very dense and cold gas and dust ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "two of them , tc3 and tc4 , exhibit unambiguous signs of star formation activity and are associated with outflows .",
    "the dust and line properties of tc3 and tc4 are very similar to those of some massive protostellar cores observed in orion , once scaled at the distance of the hii region .",
    "the physical properties of their outflows are also similar to those powered by intermediate and high - mass sources .",
    "the sio abundances we derive ( @xmath217 ) are also typical of outflows from young protostars and/or high - mass sources . tc4 might be associated with a point - like infrared source at 12@xmath181 m ; tc3 remains undetected at this wavelength and is a potential true high - mass protostar .",
    "the dust cores are embedded in a dense layer of molecular gas .",
    "the physical properties of this component suggest it is made of material compressed by the precursor shock of the ionization front driven by the exciting star of the trifid .",
    "based on a simple comparison of the large - scale properties of the dust cores with analytical studies ( mass and size ) , it seems plausible that they formed from the fragmentation of the dense compressed layer . rather than tc3 and tc4 experiencing the shock ahead of the ionization front while in the protostellar phase",
    ", the core formation and gravitational collapse of these cores could have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula a few @xmath3 ago .",
    "our isocam data suggest that the formation of tc3 and tc4 has been preceeded by other star formation episodes in the whole nebula .",
    "several @xmath3 later after the birth of the trifid nebula , young massive protostars are still formed in the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "the protostellar cores of the trifid provide us with a large wealth of information on the infancy of now well - developed and well studied hii regions like orion .",
