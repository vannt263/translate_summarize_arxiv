    "the potential of graphene  @xcite  a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal of carbon atoms tightly packed in a honeycomb lattice  in optoelectronics , photonics , and plasmonics is attracting a truly considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "the particle - hole - symmetric spectrum of massless dirac fermions  @xcite in graphene and its structureless optical conductivity  @xcite are particularly suitable  @xcite to realize detectors of radiation in a wide range of photon energies from visible to terahertz ( thz ) frequencies . as a consequence",
    ", the photoresponse of a graphene sheet has been the subject of truly intense investigations  @xcite .",
    "three main photoresponse mechanisms have been identified in the literature to date .",
    "( i ) a finite dc response to an oscillating radiation field can simply stem from the ordinary _ photovoltaic _ effect .",
    "photons impinging on the sample excite electron - hole pairs and their basic constituents ( the electron and the hole ) are separated by the electric field across a p - n junction .",
    "( ii ) it has been recognized that hot - carrier - assisted transport plays an important role in graphene  @xcite . due to the large optical phonon energy scale in this material",
    ", hot carriers created by the radiation field can remain at a temperature higher than that of the lattice for several tens of @xmath0 .",
    "equilibration with the lattice occurs indeed mainly because of scattering between carriers and acoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "these processes take place on a @xmath1 timescale , although they can experience a speed - up in the case of disorder - assisted collisions  @xcite .",
    "hot carriers can therefore significantly alter the photoresponse of a graphene sheet  @xcite by virtue of the _ photo - thermoelectric _ effect .",
    "carrier multiplication  @xcite can greatly enhance the performance of graphene photodetectors operating on the basis of photovoltaic and photo - thermoelectric effects .",
    "( iii ) finally , _",
    "bolometric _ effects can play an important role in the photoresponse of a graphene sheet . in this case , the radiation impinging on the sample produces heating , which , in turn , affects the magnitude of the resistance .",
    "schematics of a dyakonov - shur single - layer - graphene field - effect transistor for photodetection .",
    "an oscillating radiation field coupled to a graphene field - effect transistor creates an oscillating potential difference @xmath2 between the back gate and source .",
    "the graphene flake is deposited on a substrate with dielectric constant @xmath3 and is separated by a distance @xmath4 from the back gate .",
    "the dielectric constant of the material above the graphene sheet is @xmath5 .",
    "the separation between source and drain is @xmath6 . because of the intrinsic nonlinear response of the two - dimensional electron fluid in the field - effect transistor channel , a finite dc potential difference @xmath7 , which is proportional to the power of the incident radiation ( i.e.  @xmath8 ) , is measured between the source and drain at _ zero _ source - drain bias . ]    in a series of pioneering papers  @xcite , which appeared in the mid nineties , dyakonov and shur ( ds ) proposed a very elegant mechanism that yields a finite dc response to an oscillating radiation field .",
    "the ds photodetection mechanism is based on the fact that a field - effect transistor ( fet ) hosting a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) acts as a cavity for plasma waves . when these are weakly damped , i.e.  when a plasma wave launched at the source can reach the drain in a time shorter than the momentum relaxation time @xmath9 , the detection of radiation exploits constructive interference of the plasma waves in the cavity , which results in a resonantly enhanced response .",
    "this is the so - called _ resonant regime _ of plasma - wave photodetection .",
    "plasma waves propagating in the fet channel can not be simply identified with the well - known `` plasmons '' of a 2deg  @xcite .",
    "indeed , plasma waves are collective oscillations that occur in a _ gated _ 2deg , whereby the long - range tail of the coulomb interaction among electrons is screened by the presence of a metal gate .",
    "plasma waves with wave vector @xmath10 ( where @xmath4 is the distance between the 2deg and the gate ) have a gapless dispersion relation @xmath11 ( at zero temperature and neglecting friction and viscosity  @xcite ) which resembles that of sound waves in ordinary gases and liquids . on the contrary ,",
    "plasmons in a 2deg with long - range coulomb interactions have a dispersion relation which is proportional to @xmath12 in the long - wavelength limit  @xcite .",
    "ds showed  @xcite that the photovoltage response of the 2deg in a fet , i.e.  the electric potential difference between drain and source , contains a dc component even if the incoming field is ac , and thus provides rectification of the signal . in the resonant regime ,",
    "the dc photoresponse is characterized by peaks at the odd multiples of the lowest plasma - wave frequency .",
    "this rectification mechanism is of purely dynamical origin and is not related to other rectification mechanisms ( occurring , for the example , at the contacts ) which could also be present in a real device .",
    "note that rectification of the signal is necessary to detect incoming radiation that exceeds the typical cutoff frequencies of circuit elements .",
    "the ds mechanism is therefore particularly useful to detect thz radiation .",
    "the ds mechanism relies on two facts .",
    "( i ) the reflection symmetry corresponding to the exchange of source with drain in the fet channel ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : one ] ) is broken by the ds boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions are unusual because ds fixed the value of the current at the drain and the value of the potential at the source ( instead of operating the device by fixing the current or the potential both at the source and at the drain , as is more customary ) .",
    "( ii ) the fact that the photovoltage averaged over a cycle of the oscillating radiation field is finite ultimately stems from the nonlinearity of the continuity equation and can be viewed as a result of the gate modulating _ both _ the electron density and the drift velocity in the channel .",
    "a substantial amount of experimental work has been carried out on ds photodetection in 2degs in ordinary semiconductor heterojunctions : for recent reviews see e.g.  refs .  .",
    "recent experimental work  @xcite has demonstrated that the ds photodetection mechanism is active also in the case of the 2d massless dirac fermion ( mdf ) fluid in a graphene fet .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated room - temperature thz detectors based on antenna - coupled graphene fets , which exploit the ds mechanism but display also contributions of photovoltaic and photo - thermoelectric origin .",
    "the plasma waves excited by thz radiation in ref .",
    "are overdamped and the fabricated thz detectors , although enabling large area , fast imaging of macroscopic samples , do not _ yet _ operate in the aforementioned resonant regime .    in this article",
    "we present a theory of ds plasma - wave photodetection in a graphene fet in the resonant regime .",
    "we take into account fundamental differences between ordinary parabolic - band 2degs  @xcite and 2d mdf fluids . by employing the theory of relativistic hydrodynamics ,",
    "we demonstrate in a fully analytical fashion that nonlinearities of purely relativistic origin substantially influence the response of graphene - based plasma - wave photodetectors .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : model ] we present a hydrodynamic theory of transport for mdfs in a gated graphene sheet . in sec .",
    "[ sect : instability ] we discuss the plasma - wave instability which arises when a graphene fet is subject to a small dc current bias . in sec .",
    "[ sect : photoresponse ] we use the hydrodynamic theory outlined in sec .",
    "[ sect : model ] to calculate the photoresponse of a graphene fet to an oscillating electromagnetic field when ds boundary conditions are applied . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] we summarize our main findings and draw our main conclusions .",
    "the theory of hydrodynamics  @xcite can be applied to describe transport in a 2d electron fluid when electron - electron ( e - e ) collisions take place on a time scale @xmath13 which is much shorter than the typical time scale of the evolution of macroscopic variables ( density , current , and energy ) . at the same time , collisions with impurities and phonons , which spoil the conservation of momentum and energy , must be assumed to occur much less frequently .    in the case of present interest , we require @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lowest frequency of a plasma wave in the fet .",
    "this requirement implies that plasma waves are collective modes which can be excited in the `` collisional '' regime , when e - e interactions dominate the dynamics . on the contrary , plasmons are collective modes which can be excited in the `` collisionless '' regime , because they can be understood , in the first instance and at long wavelengths , as the sloshing mode of the center of mass of the electron liquid .",
    "to estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath16 for plasma waves , we use the following result  @xcite for the plasma - wave group velocity @xmath17 which will be re - derived below  see eq .",
    "( [ eq : plasmaspeed ] ) . here",
    "@xmath18 is the fermi velocity of mdfs in graphene , @xmath4 is the distance between graphene and the gate ( see fig .  [ fig : one ] ) , @xmath19 is the fermi momentum corresponding to an average carrier ( electron or hole ) concentration @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the number of fermion flavors in graphene ( due to spin and valley degrees of freedom ) .",
    "finally , @xmath22 is a dimensionless parameter that controls the strength of e - e interactions  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic definition of @xmath22 will be given below after eq .",
    "( [ eq : plasmaspeed ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( corresponding to a typical doping @xmath26 ) , and we find @xmath27 .",
    "we notice that @xmath28 with these parameters .",
    "the largest wave vector @xmath29 of a plasma - wave resonance supported by the electron liquid in the fet channel is @xmath30 , which corresponds to a standing wave with a node at the source and an antinode at the drain .",
    "taking @xmath31 for a typical device , we have @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "the transit time of a plasma wave in the device is @xmath35 .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath13 can be obtained by dividing the typical distance between two electrons ( @xmath36 ) by the fermi velocity , i.e.  @xmath37 .",
    "this is in agreement with recent ultrafast two - color pump - probe measurements that have reported a time scale of the order of tens of femtoseconds to establish thermal equilibrium in single - layer graphene  @xcite . for plasma waves in a graphene fet channel we therefore obtain @xmath38 , which shows that the electron system in a typical graphene fet is in the collisional regime . on the contrary , to verify that , in the absence of a gate , plasmon excitations can not be described within a collisional hydrodynamic theory , we consider the dispersion  @xcite @xmath39 , evaluated at @xmath40 .",
    "using the same parameters as above , we find @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and then @xmath43 .",
    "when the hydrodynamic assumption holds true , the system is in local equilibrium , i.e.  the electron distribution is a fermi - dirac distribution and does not evolve in time due to e - e collisions .",
    "however , the parameters of the electron distribution change slowly in time and space and determine thermodynamic and hydrodynamic observables , which are not necessarily steady and evolve in time according to macroscopic conservation laws in the presence of suitable boundary conditions and slowly - varying external potentials .    before concluding , we emphasize that for typical device lengths , the plasma - wave frequency @xmath44 is in the thz regime .",
    "for example , changing @xmath6 from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , the plasma - wave frequency in a graphene fet changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "for this reason , photodetectors based on the ds mechanism are naturally useful in the context of thz light detection .",
    "hydrodynamic equations  @xcite can be derived from the boltzmann semiclassical equation following a standard procedure  @xcite , which relies on the conservation of the particle number , total momentum , and total energy in e - e scattering processes .",
    "an outline of the derivation of hydrodynamic equations for 2d mdfs in graphene is reported in the appendix .",
    "the continuity equation takes the familiar form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total carrier density and @xmath51 is the electron ( hole ) density .",
    "carriers drift with the local average velocity @xmath52 .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) is identical in form to the corresponding equation for an ordinary parabolic - band 2deg .",
    "the euler and energy equations , on the contrary , are dramatically different from the 2deg case and are reported in the appendix . with the aim of investigating the dynamics of plasma waves in gated graphene flakes ,",
    "we restrict here to the limit in which the drift velocity @xmath52 is much smaller than the fermi velocity @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the euler equation reads @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the pressure and @xmath56 is the effective potential which acts on electrons , including the electrostatic potential generated by the plasma wave and the fields of nearby conductors .",
    "note that the `` free '' parts of the euler and energy equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eulerfullrel ] ) and  ( [ eq : energyfullrel ] ) in the appendix , respectively ] can be written in a very compact form by making use of a covariant notation , commonly employed in relativistic problems  @xcite , where the fermi velocity @xmath53 plays the role of the speed of light @xmath57 . in the covariant notation",
    ", the euler and energy equations correspond to the space- and time - like component of the divergence of the relativistic energy - momentum tensor  @xcite .",
    "this formal analogy stems from the highly - nonlinear relation [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : momentumrudin ] ) in the appendix ] between the average drift momentum @xmath58 and the drift velocity @xmath59 , which , in turn , stems from the linear mdf dispersion of carriers in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the average drift velocity @xmath52 is smaller than the fermi velocity due to the large number of e - e scattering events that take place in the hydrodynamic limit in a period of a plasma wave .",
    "of course , the formal analogy with relativistic fluid dynamics does not mean that the fermi velocity is the largest velocity at which signals can causally propagate in a 2d mdf fluid .",
    "indeed , as shown above , the plasma - wave group velocity @xmath60 is typically larger than @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb interaction between electrons and all the external potentials propagate instantaneously and do not obey relativistic causality .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory of mdfs in graphene is therefore fundamentally different from the hydrodynamic theory of truly relativistic fluids , which is routinely employed to describe e.g.  plasmas of astrophysical interest .",
    "we now focus our analysis on the limit @xmath61 ( limit of vanishingly small hole concentration ) and approximate @xmath62 .",

    "( [ eq : pressurefull ] ) in the appendix ] can then be approximated as @xmath68 the euler equation reduces to @xmath69      let us now consider a graphene flake , which lies in the plane @xmath70 and is subject to the presence of a gate located at @xmath71 . the gate will be modeled as a perfect conductor . according to fig .",

    "in which the distance between the graphene sheet and gate is much smaller than the typical wavelength of density oscillations , the relation ( [ eq : channelpotential ] ) between the density and gate - to - channel swing assumes the local form @xmath92 the latter expression is known as the `` gradual channel '' approximation  @xcite . in this regime",
    ", the long - range tail of the coulomb interaction is completely screened by the charges on the gate .",
    "using the gradual channel approximation , the euler and continuity equations read @xmath93 and @xmath94      in this section we make a crude approximation on the euler equation ( [ eq : eulergca ] ) for a 2d mdf fluid to recover earlier results pertaining to the 2deg literature .    when the two terms on the second line of eq .",

    "the photovoltage ( [ eq : photovoltage ] ) depends sensibly on the ratio @xmath217 between the fermi velocity @xmath53 and the effective plasma - wave speed @xmath150 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) we see that this ratio can be tuned in the range @xmath218 $ ] by changing the distance @xmath4 between graphene and the gate , the dielectric constant @xmath3 , and the average carrier density @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig : photovoltage ] shows that the photoresponse of a system that is described by relativistic hydrodynamics can be tuned to regimes where its resonant maxima have larger amplitude and its minima are shallower .",

    "in particular , we have shown that this yields a breakdown of galilean invariance whereby the speed of plasma waves in the frame of the moving fluid is not connected by a galilean transformation to that in the laboratory frame .",
    "moreover , the photoresponse substantially depends on the peculiar nonlinearities of the equations of motion which arise due to the formal relativistic nature of the energy - momentum dispersion of carriers in graphene .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to leverage the effect of these nonlinearities to increase the photoresponse of a gated graphene sheet with respect to that occurring in an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "measuring the photoresponse of a graphene sheet in a fet geometry offers the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections to the ordinary hydrodynamic theory .    finally , we emphasize that the present theory assumes that the gate of the fet is as long as the channel . in certain experimental situations  @xcite it may be more convenient to exploit gates which are much shorter than the fet channel . in this case",
