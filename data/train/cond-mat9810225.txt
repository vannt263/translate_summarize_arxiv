    "we plan to study some spectral properties of the one - dimensional dirac hamiltonian describing a dirac particle of mass @xmath3 in a magnetic field @xmath4 and in an electric ( or scalar ) potential @xmath5 : @xmath6 where the fields are random functions of the position @xmath7 .",
    "we present a first motivation for this work . in @xcite",
    "the authors drew what the space of coupling constants and the renormalization group flow would look like for the 2d random dirac fermions . using bosonization and the renormalization group , they derived exact results on localization / delocalization in random magnetic field , and in random mass field .",
    "however , in the sole presence of an electric potential disorder , the renormalization scheme flows away from the gaussian fixed point to some inaccessible quantum hall - like transition fixed point .",
    "what is so interesting with this type of disorder is that magnetic or / and mass disorder do not suffice to account for the integer quantum hall effect fixed point .",
    "thus the electric potential disorder seems to be a relevant field in the flow to the true quantum hall fixed point , even though there are just clues this fixed point exists in the flow diagram of the 2d dirac fermions .",
    "chalker and ho in @xcite also emphasized the importance of the electric potential disorder .",
    "they took the continuum isotropic limit of the network model , known to capture the key features of the localization / delocalization transition in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "they managed to map this continuum limit to the model of 2d dirac fermions in random fields .",
    "in particular they showed there exists an electric potential random field locally measuring the magnetic flux per plaquette in the network .",
    "though it should not shed much light on the 2d problem , we thought it would be interesting to solve thoroughly the 1d problem .",
    "in particular , we shall see that there exists a non trivial exact mapping between the magnetic disorder and the electric disorder .",
    "this is to be compared to an argument proposed in @xcite relating the random mass field and the random electric potential field .",
    "a second motivation for this work is to know whether a true one - dimensional dirac particle may be in delocalized states .",
    "it is already known that there is a zero energy delocalized state in random mass field ( or alternatively in random magnetic field ) .",
    "is there any other delocalized states when different types of disorder are present ? as we shall see , the answer is essentially no .",
    "the third motivation comes from the study of spectral properties of the quasi - unidimensional 2d hamiltonian , describing a massive dirac particle in a potential vector and in an electric potential @xmath8 the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the potential vector @xmath11 , the mass @xmath12 , and the electric potential @xmath5 are all random functions obeying independent gaussian laws .",
    "the three random fields are supposed to depend only on @xmath7 .",
    "because of gauge invariance the component @xmath13 can be chosen to be zero .",
    "fourier transforming on the y coordinate ( and thus acting on wavefunctions of the form @xmath14 , one gets    @xmath15    where @xmath4 stands for @xmath16 .",
    "we now fix the average value of @xmath12 to be @xmath3 and set @xmath17 to be the average value of @xmath4 thus redefining it into a random function with vanishing mean .",
    "the average value of @xmath5 can be chosen to be zero up to rescaling the energy of the hamiltonian . by means of a unitary transformation which applies @xmath18 to @xmath19 , @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and @xmath19 to @xmath22 , and for convenience",
    ", we shall adopt the following equivalent form of the hamiltonian @xmath6 with the given average values @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the fields @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath5 will be ( somehow arbitrarily ) respectively called _ magnetic field _ , _ mass field _ and _ electric potential field_. @xmath26 is precisely the hamiltonian we would like to study . note that the random mass model ( i.e. @xmath27 ) which stems from a particular form of @xmath26 has already been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec1 ] , [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , we map the resolvent calculation to a quantum mechanical problem , using the replica trick . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we derive exact formulas for the resolvent . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we calculate the exact density of states and the typical localization length in various configurations of disorder .",
    "then , in section [ sec6 ] , we sketch an alternative derivation using supersymmetry in a straightforward fashion",
    ". finally in section [ sec7 ] we study mappings between different disordered hamiltonians .",
    "we wish to calculate the resolvent of the hamiltonian @xmath26 in order to extract its density of states and its localization length . in order to do",
    "so we will map the associated one - dimensional statistical field theory onto a quantum mechanical problem using feynman procedure .",
    "the two - point resolvent is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are spin indices .",
    "the spin components of the resolvent are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is strictly positive .",
    "taking advantage of the translational invariance of the ensemble average of the resolvent @xmath33 , one can write @xmath34 which also define @xmath35 as the _ average _ of the previous resolvent @xmath36 . the integrand",
    "can then be formally represented by means of a bosonic field @xmath37 with two spinorial components @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 we then obtain @xmath40 the logarithm can be averaged using the replica trick .",
    "so replicating @xmath41 times the two - component bosonic field , we are led to @xmath42      feynman formalism can be applied to map this one - dimensional path integral ( statistical field theory ) to a 0-dimensional quantum field theory , that is to say a mere quantum theory .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the corresponding physical hamiltonian is hermitian in some precise sense . here",
    "physical means retaining @xmath43 in the hamiltonian since the imaginary part of the energy is a mathematical artifice to probe the analytic properties of the resolvent .    nevertheless when we re - establish @xmath44 in order to obtain analytic properties of the resolvent , we shall rewrite the partition function as one of a statistical field theory in imaginary time : @xmath45    we can now rename @xmath46 as @xmath47 and make it strictly positive ( then shrinking the previous @xmath48 part of the energy term to zero ) . when all calculations are done , we will continue on @xmath47 to re - establish it to the imaginary axis .",
    "from now on , @xmath49 stands for @xmath35 after having continued @xmath46 to the imaginary axis .    as a consequence ,",
    "we have @xmath50 the @xmath51 is placed here to compensate the fact that the first derivative is now done with respect to the imaginary energy .",
    "actually the previous path integral formulas are ill defined for the reason that they correspond to an unbounded quantum theory . to see it",
    ", we follow the feynman procedure , write the classical hamiltonian associated to the previous path - integrals , then quantize it .",
    "the momenta for the spinorial fields @xmath52 are @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the lagrangian density and the dot indicates derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "so the euclidean coherent state path integral formalism yields the classical hamiltonian @xmath55 before any ensemble averaging .",
    "to quantize this hamiltonian , we impose the following canonical commutators : @xmath56=\\delta_{k , l}\\delta(x - y).\\ ] ] this leads to a @xmath57 term in the quantum hamiltonian which makes it unbounded .",
    "this is due to the minus sign appearing within the spin down components product . to quantize the hamiltonian safely we have the freedom to make any transformation on the canonical operators whenever the canonical commutation relations remain unmodified . for dirac fermions",
    "the correct procedure would be to fill the dirac sea upon making a particle hole transformation .",
    "however , such a change of vacuum is not appropriate for the bosons that would condensate anyway .",
    "so healing the unbounded bosonic hamiltonian requires a stronger transformation .",
    "one can set @xmath58 the minus sign is due to heal the unboundedness of the spectrum .",
    "the additional particle - hole transformation restores the commutation relations destroyed by the inversion of the spin component operators .",
    "the tribute to such a regularizing transformation is that the spinor momentum @xmath59 is not any more the hermitian conjugate of @xmath52 .",
    "we shall see that the internal dynamical symmetry of the replicated hamiltonian is not @xmath60 any more but the non compact @xmath61 group .",
    "we will call dynamical algebra ( or improperly group ) , any algebra which generators are the sole building blocks of the hamiltonian .",
    "let us define the hermitian spin operators @xmath62 . with the operators @xmath63 , they form the @xmath64 generators of @xmath1 .",
    "in components , the spin operators read : @xmath65 we will notice that , be it before of after averaging , the hamiltonian ( or the hamiltonian density ) does only depend on the sum operators @xmath66 then we define the corresponding ladder operators , which we shall later use to generate physical sectors of the effective hamiltonian @xmath67 they obey @xmath68 commutation rules @xmath69=-2z^0 \\qquad [ z^0,z^-]=z^+ \\qquad [ z^0,z^-]=-z^-\\ ] ] which have to be completed with the identity @xmath70 , which tells us which real form of @xmath71 the spin operators @xmath72 are the generators of .",
    "this statement implies that the dynamical algebra can be reduced from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "such a strong simplification , which was not previously known , also occur in the supersymmetric version of the derivation .",
    "the disorder fields can be written away in the vector field @xmath73 with mean value @xmath74 .",
    "the most general gaussian disorder distribution can be written using a covariance matrix @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath75 is assumed to be symmetric and positive definite , as it seems physically reasonable .",
    "the gaussian measure is then @xmath76 performing the average , one obtains an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath77 which does not depend any more on @xmath7 .",
    "we next rescale our hamiltonian in order to eliminate the inconvenient @xmath78 factor . choosing to discard off - diagonal mixing terms in the covariance matrix",
    ", we will adopt the definitive form of our effective hamiltonian : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the disorder strengths .",
    "as announced , the effective hamiltonian does only depend on the spin operators @xmath72 . from the definition we retained for a dynamical algebra",
    ", one immediately sees that @xmath0 is a dynamical algebra of @xmath83 .",
    "we shall now describe some groundstate sector properties in a view to evaluate @xmath84 when @xmath85 goes to infinity and @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 .",
    "[ sec3 ]      one can look for the groundstate of the effective ( averaged ) hamiltonian in the lowest weight space generated by the dynamical symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "since the trace operator of @xmath0 commutes with @xmath83 , we can restrict our dynamical symmetry to @xmath68 in any labeled sector of the hamiltonian .",
    "the lowest weight of the desired space is equal to @xmath87 as the sum of the n spin-@xmath88 discrete lowest weight representations of each individual spin .",
    "call @xmath89 the lowest vector of this particular representation .",
    "the states of this representation space , generated by the action of operator @xmath90 on @xmath89 are @xmath91 .",
    "the norms of such states can be quite easily computed .",
    "we obtain @xmath92 reducing the dynamical symmetry allows us to generate the whole representation space as above .",
    "another advantage is that one can as easily calculate the action of the spin operators in the @xmath93 basis .",
    "we shall see now that the replica limit @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 is mathematically well defined .",
    "as long as @xmath41 is a positive integer , the groundstate sector remains a lowest weight representation space of @xmath68 belonging to the discrete series .",
    "when @xmath41 tends to 0 in the interval @xmath950,1[$ ] , then the representation space does not any more belong to the discrete series but to the supplementary series . in vilenkin s notation , this representation is labeled by @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the series of @xmath97 states is not any more truncated below by the action of @xmath98 on @xmath99 .",
    "theoretically it spans down to @xmath100 .",
    "remarkably , when @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 , we have @xmath101 so that , at the precise point corresponding to the physical disordered system ( @xmath102 ) , the restriction of the scalar product within the groundstate sector degenerates . the @xmath97 states are null states except when @xmath103 . when @xmath41 is in @xmath950,\\infty[$ ] , one can define a proper scalar product in the groundstate sector for wavefunctions of the form @xmath104 : @xmath105 which is identical to vilenkin s formula ( see also @xcite ) but truncated below @xmath103 .",
    "recall the effective replicated hamiltonian is @xmath106 the expansion of the groundstate on the @xmath107 basis is @xmath108 .",
    "it satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 is expected to behave like @xmath111 when @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 .",
    "re - written in @xmath107 the basis , this eigenvalue equation yields @xmath112 the equation is valid for any integer @xmath113 .      for technical reasons ,",
    "that is when @xmath114 , we must consider a non - hermitian hamiltonian . as a consequence , feynman s formula which gives probability amplitudes of a quantum mechanical theory in terms of one - dimensional statistical path integrals ,",
    "must be written in terms of left and right eigenstates .",
    "this follows from the resolution of unity used to derive the feynman equivalence .",
    "indeed , the resolution of the identity is expressed in terms of right and left eigenstates .",
    "a simplifying feature is that our hamiltonian and its hermitian conjugate are unitarily related by means of the simple unitary transformation @xmath115 .",
    "left eigenstates lie in the dual vector space of the current fock space . in principle",
    ", there is no need to project them to the original vector space . but doing so is convenient . using the transformation @xmath116 , we can map those left eigenstates back into the fock space : @xmath117      in order to apply feynman formalism , we must normalize our groundstate wavefunction .",
    "when @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 in the limit @xmath41 goes to zero , we obtain @xmath120 . so that the normalization condition can be chosen @xmath121 .",
    "since we are interested in the limit @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 , we expand the groundstate wavefunction and its eigenvalue in powers of @xmath41 ( see @xcite for the use of such scheme on the halperin model ) . at order @xmath122",
    ", we set the notations @xmath123 at order @xmath86 , we find the equation for the groundstate of the physical system ( i.e. when @xmath102 ) @xmath124    the result is an extension of an equation obtained by luck @xcite , then balents and fisher @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath125 should bear a physical interpretation in terms of amplitudes of multiple scattering on impurities . at least formally , in the random mass model with zero mass average , the coefficient @xmath126 may be interpreted as the right - hand - side berezinskii block @xmath127 ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the recursion relation on the berezinskii blocks @xmath127 or on the groundstate coefficients @xmath126 are indeed the same ( the odd @xmath128 do not contribute ) .",
    "similarly the coefficients of the left groundstate may be interpreted as the left - hand - side berezinskii block @xmath129 .",
    "those blocks are the sum of all contributions due to scattering events happening on the right and on the left of the point where the one - point green function is computed .",
    "coming back to the hierarchical system , order @xmath122 yields the equation for @xmath130 : @xmath131 k \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\psi_k + \\frac{g_x+g_y}{2}(k+\\frac{1}{2})\\psi_k+g k \\psi_k + \\frac{1}{4}(2k+1)(g_y - g_x)\\psi_{k+2}+\\frac{1}{2}(m+i\\phi)\\psi_{k+1 } = \\lambda \\psi_k .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation at order @xmath122 can then be legitimately evaluated at @xmath103 and yields the surprisingly simple result : @xmath132      from formula ( [ 04 ] ) it is sufficient to evaluate the partition function @xmath84 in the limit where @xmath85 goes to infinity and the replica index @xmath41 goes to zero to calculate the imaginary time resolvent . in that limit ,",
    "we have @xmath133 so that with equation ( [ 10 ] ) @xmath134 note that the @xmath135 factor is due to the adopted scaling convention of the hamiltonian , and consequently of @xmath136 .      in the previous subsection , we derived an efficient way to obtain the resolvent .",
    "now , we shall show that though it is more cumbersome , we can also write the resolvent as a sum as was done in @xcite . at first , let us replicate the correlation function @xmath41 times without changing its value : @xmath137 in the limit where @xmath41 goes to @xmath86 , the partition function denominator goes to @xmath122 , so that averaging becomes possible @xmath138 after regularizing this correlator by particle - hole transformations as was done above , and mapping the path integral to the equivalent quantum problem , we get @xmath139 to render explicit this amplitude , we make use of our scalar product @xmath140 we obtain :    @xmath141",
    "we now contemplate various cases of disorder and calculate the subsequent resolvents .      the random mass model , which corresponds to the original hamiltonian @xmath142 is the only previously ( well- ) known case .",
    "@xmath12 is the random mass field and follows the gaussian measure @xmath143 .",
    "it is equivalent to many one - dimensional physical models ( see @xcite for a review on the quantum supersymmetric hamiltonian @xmath144 ) .    after",
    "averaging the effective hamiltonian one obtains @xmath145 correspondingly , its groundstate equation reads for @xmath146 @xmath147 whereas the groundstate energy ( [ 08 ] ) is slightly reduced to @xmath148    such a difference equation can be solved exactly . in literature",
    "the technique of the generating functional is often used to solve , when possible , quasi - linear recurrence equations .",
    "we prefer to use laplace method which , though equivalent , is much more convenient in such circumstances .",
    "indeed it allows to pick up a particular solution of the equation thanks to the choice of the appropriate contour in the complex plane .",
    "this is all the more useful since we expect only one physically acceptable solution among a finite dimensional vector space of solutions .",
    "let us detail how we use it .",
    "we start giving an integral representation of @xmath125 in the complex plane along a contour @xmath149 : @xmath150    the kernel @xmath151 has to be chosen in order to yield the simplest differential equation on @xmath152 .",
    "the contour @xmath149 must be chosen so as to obtain a solution different from zero .",
    "it also has to be chosen in a view to pick up the desired solution in case there are more than one .",
    "if the contour possesses boundaries , we require @xmath153 to tend to zero fast enough ( depending on @xmath151 ) in their vicinities .    for our purpose , we choose the melin kernel , @xmath154 .",
    "then it is straightforward to show that we get the correspondence rules @xmath155 the groundstate wavefunction equation then reads @xmath156 \\psi_w+\\frac{g}{4}w\\left[2-w^2-\\frac{1}{w^2}\\right ] \\partial_w \\psi_w=0\\ ] ] which is a solvable ( first order ) differential equation",
    ". an acceptable contour for which the series @xmath157 ( on which depend @xmath49 ) converges is the interval @xmath95 - 1,1[$ ] . solving for @xmath153 then inserting it in the integral representation ( [ 12 ] ) ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath158 it is noteworthy that this integral has already been obtained in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the author treats the problem of the xx spin chain , with disorder in the couplings , our mass disorder , and bathed in a transverse magnetic field , playing the role of our mean value @xmath3 of the random mass field .",
    "his derivation resorts to the characteristic exponent @xmath159 of the localization problem , which can be formally identified to @xmath160 .",
    "this model is known to be ultimately equivalent to the random mass model with zero or finite mean value of the random mass field .",
    "the latter @xmath125 is not normalized .",
    "recall @xmath161 , so taking @xmath162 as the wavefunction component normalizes the groundstate .",
    "thanks to the change of variable @xmath163 and to some integrations by parts we finally obtain an expression for @xmath136 @xmath164 where @xmath151 is the modified bessel function of the second type .",

    "indeed the application of thouless formula to our case yields @xmath166 after analytic continuation on the energy .",
    "the final expressions for the density of states and inverse localization length can be found in @xcite .",
    "they are drawn in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "they are special cases of the foregoing formulas related to the problem of a random mass particle in a constant magnetic field ( see table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "the random electric potential model of a massless particle corresponds to the original hamiltonian @xmath167 where the electric potential @xmath5 follows the gaussian measure @xmath168 .",

    "the density of states and localization length are well - known and given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "coming back to the disordered case , the density of states and inverse localization length can be obtained through thouless formula . in that case , it is cumbersome to write definitive expressions for them because the bessel functions @xmath177 bear an _ imaginary index_. we have drawn them anyway in figure [ fig2 ] .    when there is disorder , the particle penetrates ( statistically speaking ) in the mass band .",
    "that is why it is interesting to study the weak disorder limit in that range of energy . to derive asymptotic expansion of the density of states and inverse localization length , we apply the steepest descent method to the integral representation of the modified bessel function @xmath177 .",
    "because the index of the bessel function is an imaginary index , we can not straightforwardly resort to tabulated asymptotics bessel function expansions .",
    "surprisingly , this technique only yields real values when expanding @xmath179 .",
    "this remark is valid to all orders .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath179 that accounts for the part of the density curve in the band @xmath95-m , m[$ ] is provided by the direction of rapid oscillations which is transverse to the steepest way in the complex plane .",

    "we then find @xmath185    on average , the residual densities of states at @xmath186 is @xmath187    the average length of energy penetration in the mass band can be extracted from ( [ 07 ] ) and is of the same order than @xmath188 .",
    "we would like to know what the effect of combining two or three types of disorder is .",
    "we will show that such a combination destroys the @xmath186 singularity . to be as simple as possible",
    ", we will choose the mean values of those random fields to be vanishing .",
    "yet the calculations could be generalized to non - zero mean values .",
    "this corresponds to the original hamiltonian @xmath189 where @xmath12 is the random mass of the particle , @xmath4 the random magnetic field and @xmath5 the electric potential .",

    "this is due to the fact that equation ( [ 02 ] ) is linear in @xmath17 .",
    "the laplace method then provides us with a first order differential equation .",
    "that is why an exact explicit expression can always be obtained .",
    "in @xcite , the authors make use of the supersymmetric trick to describe the random mass model in the vicinity of @xmath211 . they obtained equation ( [ 01 ] ) after they identified the groundstate sector by pre - diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we will see that this diagonalization is not necessary and that the sought sector can be algebraically generated as a degenerate @xmath68 grade - star representation .",
    "similarly to the replica version , we will identify @xmath212 as the dynamical group of the effective hamiltonian , preferably to @xmath213 .",
    "the path integral representation of the resolvent can be obtained as in @xcite .",
    "we recall the formula for the averaged resolvent : @xmath214    as in the replica case , we can now rename @xmath46 as @xmath47 and make it strictly positive .",
    "when all calculations are done , we will continue on @xmath47 to re - establish it to the imaginary axis .",
    "similarly to the replica case , the previous path integral formula is ill defined , at least as far as the bosons are concerned . to see it",
    ", we follow the feynman procedure and write the classical hamiltonian associated to the previous path - integral",
    ". we will then quantize it .",
    "the momenta for the spinorial fields @xmath37 and @xmath215 are @xmath216 where the dots indicate derivative with respect to @xmath7 . here",
    "the fermionic derivative is a right derivative .",
    "the euclidean coherent state path integral formalism yields the classical hamiltonian @xmath217 before any ensemble averaging .",
    "to quantize this hamiltonian , we impose the following canonical commutator : @xmath218=\\delta(x - y ) .\\ ] ] this leads to a @xmath219 term which makes the quantum hamiltonian unbounded , due to the minus sign appearing in the product of the spin down component operators .",
    "to quantize the hamiltonian safely we have the freedom to make any canonical transformation on the spin component operators .",
    "for the dirac fermions the correct procedure is to fill the dirac sea upon making the particle hole transformation : @xmath220 however , as we already noticed in the replica case , such a procedure is inappropriate for the bosons . as before we need a stronger transformation .",
    "we then set @xmath221 the minus sign heals the unboundedness of the spectrum and the additional particle - hole transformation restores the commutation relation destroyed by the inversion of the spin down component operators .",
    "again , as a result , the spinor momentum @xmath222 is not the hermitian conjugate of @xmath37 .",
    "the internal dynamical symmetry of the supersymmetric hamiltonian is not any more @xmath223 but @xmath224 .    in order to go beyond this dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian ,",
    "let us define the following hermitian spin operators @xmath225 like in the replica case , we point out that the hamiltonian does only depend on those sum operators . then we define the corresponding ladder operators @xmath226 which obey @xmath68 commutation rules : @xmath227=-2{\\cal j}^0 \\qquad [ { \\cal j}^0 , { \\cal j}^-]={\\cal j}^+ \\qquad [ { \\cal j}^0,{\\cal j}^-]=-{\\cal j}^-.\\ ] ] however , as such , this statement is incorrect because we can not avoid @xmath228 . by computing the commutation relations of the spin operators , we merely proved they generate a @xmath71 algebra but did not stipulate its real form .",
    "the reason of that difference is that although the bosonic part of @xmath229 represents a bosonic @xmath68 spin , the fermionic part represents a @xmath230 spin .",
    "now we shall show how to `` transmute '' this last spin into a @xmath68 one .",
    "such a transformation is conceivable because the fock space is a grade space .",
    "hence two types of star representations are permitted .",
    "we shall resort to the unusual one : the grade - star representation .",
    "it is characterized by the properties of the adjoint operation @xcite on the lie algebra operators : @xmath231^\\dagger=(-1)^{\\deg p.\\deg q}[p^\\dagger , q^\\dagger ]   \\qquad ( q^+)^\\dagger=(-1)^{\\deg q}q.\\ ] ] @xmath232 are c - number and @xmath233 are operators .",
    "@xmath234 takes the value @xmath86 or @xmath122 whether @xmath235 is even or odd .    in order to satisfy such identities",
    ", we must change our fock space scalar product .",
    "it was previously implicitly defined by the creation / annihilation operators and how they act on the vacuum .",
    "now assume that instead of the usual definition of conjugation for fermionic operators @xmath236 we prefer @xmath237 which are coherent assumptions provided we accept to redefine the scalar product in the fermionic sector of the fock space .",
    "one can check the compatibility of this new _ scalar product _ with the grade - star adjoint operation through @xmath238 for any homogeneous operator @xmath235 and homogeneous vectors @xmath7 and @xmath239 . yet , this _ scalar product _ is not any more positive definite ( that is why in principle we should not call it any more scalar product ) . for example if @xmath240 is the fermionic vacuum of norm unity , then @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "more generally a state with @xmath243 or @xmath244 fermions has norm @xmath122 , whereas a state with @xmath245 or @xmath246 fermions has norm @xmath247 .",
    "a consequence of this change is that we recover @xmath248 .",
    "another related consequence is that the effective hamiltonian in real time and when @xmath43 ( physical limit ) is a true hermitian operator , provided we accept the degenerate scalar product . as a result",
    "the @xmath249 spin operators now thoroughly obey the constraints of a @xmath68 algebra .",
    "this statement implies that the dynamical algebra can be reduced from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "such a strong simplification is analogous to what occurs in the replica derivation .",
    "a practical consequence is that once we identified the ( grade ) star representation of the dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian , we can easily generate its main sectors .",
    "for example the groundstate sector is generated by the states @xmath250 , where now @xmath89 stands for both the bosonic and fermionic vacuum . within our formalism",
    "we can now write them explicitly in terms of creation operators : @xmath251 which are precisely the states obtained in @xcite .",
    "the left eigenstates can be mapped from the vector dual space to the usual space by means of the unitary operator @xmath252 , which is a supersymmetric operator . the action of the general hamiltonian @xmath253 on the expanded groundstate @xmath108 produces 0-order equation ( [ 02 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the replica analog , the supersymmetric method only leads to the sum formula ( [ 05 ] ) for the resolvent . indeed , using the mapping from path integral formulation to quantum mechanics , we may only write the resolvent as @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the fermionic part of the generator @xmath256 .",
    "it is the analog of ( [ 11 ] ) and leads to formula ( [ 05 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss some mappings that may exist between hamiltonians with different disorders . such question is of most interest in the 2d disordered dirac fermions model .",
    "indeed it has been argued that the renormalization group flow of the random mass model can be , in some sense , mapped to the random electric potential model @xcite . in this one - dimensional case , not only",
    "does it exist at least one non - trivial mapping between disorders , but it can also be made explicit . besides there exists a more obvious mapping between magnetic and mass disorder which deserves quoting .    the geometric group with double covering group @xmath257 is the lorentz group @xmath258 .",
    "so we may imagine the 3d space of disorder coupling strengths in the following way .",
    "the time ( oz-)axis measures the potential electric coupling strength whereas the ox and oy axis measure the mass field and magnetic field strengths .",
    "the @xmath259 invariant manifolds are the hyperbolods of axis oz .",
    "@xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 are the generating operators of the lie algebra .",
    "precisely @xmath262 generates the euclidean rotation around axis oz , whereas @xmath260 and @xmath261 generate boosts of axis ox and oy . as a consequence",
    ", we can write the action of a half - turn rotation around the time axis on the spin operators : @xmath263 this rotation operator establishes a unitary mapping between physics of the random magnetic field and physics of the random mass field .",
    "more interesting is the remark that no unitary transformation can map a mass disorder ( or a magnetic disorder ) to a potential electric disorder .",
    "indeed no unitary boost is able to map a spatial axis to the time axis .",
    "let us now consider the non - unitary , yet non - singular , operator @xmath264 which is a boost of axis oy and imaginary angle @xmath265",
    ". we will show that it maps a random mass problem to an electric potential model .",
    "in particular we have these actions on the spin operators : @xmath266    let us start reasoning from the effective hamiltonian @xmath267 of the random mass model .",
    "then we make @xmath116 act on @xmath83 : @xmath268 upon making the replacements @xmath269 we turn the random electric potential problem of section [ sec5 ] into the model describe by @xmath270 .",
    "however being non - unitary the transformation @xmath116 is not trivial .",
    "above all we can not use scalar - product - dependent properties of the hamiltonians since we lost unitarity .",
    "that is why in such circumstances , we must consider our fock space not as an hilbert space but as a mere vector space .",
    "yet we notice that the kernels of operators are covariant objects , i.e. @xmath271 because @xmath116 is non - singular . nevertheless under suppression of the scalar product ,",
    "the kernel of @xmath83 has enlarged from a one - dimensional subspace to a two - dimensional one , because any normalization condition has been dropped .",
    "let us first describe @xmath272 .",
    "we already know that the wavefunction @xmath273 belongs to the kernel .",
    "a second independent solution is @xmath274 . to check this last statement , change variable in the recurrence equation ( [ 13 ] ) from @xmath125 to @xmath275 , and observe it became the recurrence relation for the modified bessel function of second type .",
    "so we conclude : @xmath276 our task is then to find out in a two - dimensional kernel what the _ physical _ image of our original groundstate is .",
    "we must select the right combination in the 2-dimensional space which stands for the groundstate wavefunction of our primary problem to perform such a selection .",
    "this combination does not depend on the values of the parameters of the hamiltonian because @xmath116 acts linearly on the states .",
    "to proceed we can use the alternative method of the replica and view @xmath41 as a deformation parameter .",
    "then the groundstate energy of the replicated hamiltonian @xmath277 is characterized by @xmath278 in the supersymmetric version of the problem , the selection rule of the groundstate is the convergence of the series defining the correlation functions .",
    "it applies in particular to the resolvent . in the replica case ,",
    "the analogous selection rule is the sign of @xmath136 which states whether the quantum theory is correctly defined ( bounded or not ) . since we had to forget about the scalar product , it is cumbersome to evaluate the series defining the resolvent in the original problem , whereas it is much simpler to check the sign of @xmath136 for any reasonable values of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath3 , and @xmath182 .",
    "so we can now apply our selection rule .",
    "essentially because a minus sign appears in formula ( [ 03 ] ) in comparison to the original formula ( [ 14 ] ) , the only acceptable combination in @xmath279 is the wavefunction @xmath280 .",
    "finally , we conclude @xmath281\\ ] ] and recover result ( [ 09 ] ) . practically , this way to obtain ( [ 09 ] )",
    "saves many calculations .",
    "in particular we transform a recursion relation of order 5 to another one of order 3 , easier to solve .",
    "we have calculated the exact density of states and the typical localization length in a few interesting cases which are : the random electric potential model , the multiple disorder model , the random mass model in presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "doing so , we used efficient algebraic methods to pinch the desired sectors of the hamiltonian . for such quantities ,",
    "the replica treatment is more straightforward thanks to the use of the replica index @xmath41 viewed as a deformation parameter .",
    "the dynamical algebra of the effective hamiltonian is @xmath0 and allows to generate easily the groundstate sector from which stem the thermodynamical properties of the models .",
    "the vector space of this groundstate sector is identified as a supplementary representation of the dynamical algebra , labelled by @xmath41 .",
    "an analog derivation is done in the supersymmetric formalism .",
    "we have also pointed out the existence of mappings between hamiltonians describing different disordered models . in particular",
    "we mapped a random mass problem to random scalar potential problem by means of a non - unitary transformation .",
    "those calculations can only be partially generalized to the calculation of the two - point green function .",
    "the algebraic simplifications in the replica and supersymmetric cases we took advantage of in pointing out the dynamical algebra are still valid , as well as the use of the laplace method . yet",
    "the differential equations that come about are invariably the confluent equations of a six elementary singularities second order differential equation .",
    "unfortunately this forbids exact calculations . besides approximations can only be done safely in the case where there is a critical point and its simplifying properties , that is in the already well - know random mass case ."
