    "another reason for using the phrase `` free - space '' is related to the fact that for communication tasks one must send the photons through some medium , e.g. fibers or free - space , whereas the latter is more applicable in the present scenario because fibers are usually not image preserving .",

    "we show how these entangled quantum carpets can be used to violate @xmath0 dimensional bell inequalities .",
    "the resolution and size of the slms and ccd cameras ( or detector arrays ) that are used to manipulate and measure the spatial field of the photons set constraints on the dimension @xmath0 that one is able to encode . in the following , we will elaborate on these constraints and provide an example with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "let us first assume that the used slm and ccd camera ( slm / ccd ) have a finite resolution but their size is infinitely extended in the transverse plane .",
    "in this case it is in principle possible to encode arbitrarily large hilbert spaces in the field of the photon .",
    "one just needs to keep in mind that there will be a relation between the encoded dimension @xmath0 and the corresponding talbot length @xmath132 , given by : @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the resolution of the slm / ccd and @xmath3 the corresponding wavelength of the photon .",
    "note that the length @xmath135 refers to the distance between those peaks of the periodic wave function which correspond to the same basis wave function @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the talbot length increases quadratically with the the encoded dimension @xmath0 .",
    "note that the propagation distance required to implement the talbot gate , given by @xmath137 , where @xmath138 for @xmath0 even and odd , respectively , increases linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "however , as long as there is no restriction on the transverse width of the slm / ccd there is in principle no constrain on the size of the encoded dimension @xmath0 .",
    "now we turn to the more realistic situation and assume that the slm / ccd has a finite extension . in order to explain this , we note that the use of the talbot effect to manipulate @xmath0 dimensional quantum information relies on the paraxial approximation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : talbot ] ) .",
    "hence , any deviation from the latter will lead to a decrease in the fidelity of the initial state with respect to itself after multiples of the talbot propagation distance .",
    "one possible source of such deviations are non - perfect plane waves that illuminate only a finite number of slits of the respective grating ( or slm ) that produces the talbot qudits .",
    "another source for deviations is the finite size of the optical elements used to manipulate or measure the photons , _",
    "e.g. _ the slm or the ccd camera , which leads to a similar effect . hence , given a certain number of illuminated slits ( which is related to the size of the slm / ccd given a fixed resolution @xmath134 )",
    ", one can propagate the talbot qudits for a certain number of talbot distances before their fidelity begins to decrease considerably .    in @xcite it was shown that for about @xmath139 illuminated slits ( or more ) , the fidelity of the talbot qudits is fairly well preserved for propagation distances of several talbot distances . for many entanglement - based purposes , such as qkd ,",
    "it is not necessary to have free - propagation for more than one or two talbot distances . of course",
    ", the photons need to be sent from one place to another which can be done with optical imaging systems that produce images of the gratings at the desired regions .",
    "the single - photon fields can then be allowed to free - propagate the distances required to perform the relevant operations .",
    "the threshold of @xmath139 illuminated slits leads to a bound on the dimension one can encode into the spatial field of the photons . to show this , we divide the size of the slm @xmath140 by the length @xmath135 and set this fraction equal to 100",
    "this leads to the following formula for the encoded dimension : @xmath141 for a typical slm we have a resolution of about @xmath142 per pixel and an overall size of @xmath143 pixels , leading to an estimated dimension @xmath144 ( if we use the larger side of the slm to manipulate the talbot qudits ) .",
    "the finite size of the slm in the second transverse dimension has little effect , since it is usually much larger than the field distribution in that direction which is typically about few millimeters in size .",
    "a bound on the encoded dimension @xmath0 directly leads to a bound on the mutual information @xmath145 one can encode into a pair of photons and reliably manipulate without considerable loss of fidelity .",
    "for instance , with @xmath144 one can send about @xmath146 random bits per photon pair in a qkd scheme ( before any post - processing such as basis reconciliation , error correction , etc ) .",

    "the observation of interference effects with material particles is one of the clearest demonstrations of the wave - like behavior of matter in quantum mechanics . in a young s @xmath0-slit",
    "experiment , interference can be revealed if the width @xmath13 of the slits in the @xmath0-slit aperture and the de broglie wavelength @xmath194 , where @xmath20 is the mass and @xmath195 the velocity of the particles , are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "consequently , an observation of the talbot effect with matter waves in the near - field after a @xmath0-slits aperture is not only possible , but in the last few decades scientists have been successfully observing matter wave interference effects with atoms and molecules with increasingly large masses @xcite . in this section , we comment briefly on the possibility of performing a bell inequality test with entangled material particles using the talbot effect .",
    "following the procedure developed in the optical context in the previous sections , the first step is to create a spatially entangled pair of material particles in an epr state , which then can be used as starting point for implementing the scheme introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : entcreation ] .",
    "however , while the wave - like behavior of atoms and large molecules is routinely observed in state - of - the - art experiments , the creation of entanglement between such material particles is rather difficult . here , we comment on two experimental proposals that allow for the creation of pairs of entangled atoms originating from bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "the first one is based on a four - wave mixing process of two colliding becs induced by a stimulated raman transitions . if the collision strength is sufficiently weak , the production of entangled epr pairs of metastable helium atoms becomes feasible @xcite .",
    "the second proposal is based on controlled molecular feshbach dissociation of molecules in a dilute bec by applying weak dissociation pulses @xcite . in both proposals",
    "the atoms can be further processed while falling in free space .    once a spatially entangled epr pair of two atoms has been produced , the entanglement creation scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec : entcreation ] can be applied in order to transform the epr state into an entangled talbot state .",
    "thus , we need to find analogs of the optical elements used to implement the @xmath0-slits , the gratings and the fourier transform .",
    "@xmath0-slits and gratings with an appropriate slit width and distance can be implemented using either nano - fabricated material gratings , or optical phase gratings which itself are realized by intra cavity laser fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , free propagating particles will independently undergo a fourier transform via propagation from the near - field to the far - field region after the respective optical elements .    at this stage",
    "we have in hand an entangled talbot state of material particles that can in principle be used to perform a test of the bell inequalities discussed in section [ sec : bell ] .",
    "thereby , the most challenging part will be to implement the phase gate ( [ eq : ztheta ] ) with propagating atoms .",
    "one possibility might be to manipulate the matter wave with light pulses that themselves are controlled via a slm in a similar manner , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we leave the details of this for future investigation .",
    "we have proposed a method to produce free - propagating entangled quantum carpets using spatially entangled photons produced by spdc .",
    "interesting aspects of these two - photon states are : 1 ) the entanglement can be controlled using the initial spatial correlations of the photons , 2 ) @xmath0-dimensional entangled states can be produced , 3 ) quantum logic operations can be performed using free - space propagation in combination with a phase element .",
