    "double - diffusive or thermohaline convection plays important role in a heat - mass transfer processes in the ocean  @xcite .",
    "it also essentially influences on different small scale processes , like formation of vertical temperature and salinity fine structure .",
    "such phenomena are not well understood at present day .",
    "there are only few works , devoted to analytical models of fine structure generation in the sea  @xcite . but",
    "no one of them essentially considers the role of double diffusion in such processes . as an exception one can mention work  @xcite , where double - diffusive step - like fine structure is simulated by numerical monte carlo methods .",
    "the purpose of this article is to develop one more mathematical model of two dimensional double - diffusive convection in a horizontally infinite layer , based on system of amplitude equations , describing formation of vertical fine structure , which in some aspects resembles actual experimental and observational data .",
    "the main idea of this work consists in combining the result , that in the limit of large rayleigh numbers convective cells tend to be narrow and tall , with constructing of abc - system of amplitude equations  @xcite with respect to vertical coordinate in the case of such cells .",
    "so this article includes two main sections apart from this one . in the section [ sec2 ] from linear stability problem",
    "we determine sizes of the most prominent cells in large rayleigh numbers limit . in the section [ sec3 ] in weakly nonlinear approximation by multi - scale decomposition technique",
    "we derive the abc - system .",
    "its numerical simulation gives vertical fine structure via so called diffusive chaos solutions .",
    "the initial equations describe two - dimensional thermohaline convection in a liquid layer of thickness @xmath0 , bounded by two infinite plane horizontal boundaries .",
    "the liquid moves in a vertical plane and the motion is described by the stream function @xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal @xmath2 and vertical @xmath3 space variables are used ; the time is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed , that there are no distributed sources of heat and salt , and on the upper and lower boundaries of the area these quantities have constant values .",
    "hence , basic distribution of temperature and salinity is linear along the vertical and is not depend on time .",
    "the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 describe variations in the temperature and salinity about this main distribution .",
    "there are two types of thermohaline convection : the fingering  @xcite , in which the warmer and more saline liquid is at the upper boundary of the area , and the diffusive type , in which the temperature and salinity are greater at the lower boundary  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the later case .",
    "the governing equations in the boussinesq approximation in dimensionless form are a system of nonlinear equations in first order partial derivatives with respect to time , that depend on four parameters : the prandtl number @xmath7 ( usual value - @xmath8 ) , the lewis number @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , usually @xmath11 ) , and the temperature @xmath12 and salinity @xmath13 rayleigh numbers @xcite : @xmath14 here the jacobian @xmath15 is introduced .",
    "first equation in ( [ maineq ] ) describes liquid particle pulse evolution in terms of stream function , second and third ones describe temperature and salt diffusion respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions for the dependent variables are chosen to be zero , which implies that the temperature and salinity at the boundaries of the area are constants , the vorticity vanishes at the boundaries , and the boundaries are impermeable : @xmath16 these boundary conditions are usually called free - slip conditions because the horizontal velocity component at the boundary does not vanish .    as a space scale",
    "the thickness of the liquid layer @xmath0 is used . as a time scale value @xmath17",
    "is used , where @xmath18 is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid .",
    "velocity field components are determined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for temperature @xmath21 and salinity @xmath22 we have relations : @xmath23 , \\\\ & & s(t , x , z)=s_{-}+\\delta { s}\\left[1-z+\\xi(t , x , z)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the temperatures and salinities on the lower and upper boundaries of the region , respectively .",
    "the temperature and salinity rayleigh numbers can be expressed as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath32 is the viscosity of the liquid , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the temperature and salinity coefficients of volume expansions .",
    "consider thermohaline convection in a limit of large @xmath13 , which is true for the most of oceanographically important applications ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "after rescaling of the time @xmath36 , and the stream function @xmath37 , we can rewrite basic system ( [ maineq ] ) in a singularly disturbed form ( primes are omitted ) : @xmath38 here a small parameter @xmath39 and a buoyancy frequency @xmath40 are introduced . in this system",
    "singular perturbations are present as @xmath41 before laplacians . if we let @xmath42 , then our system ( [ maineq2 ] ) turns into common equations , describing two - dimensional internal waves with the constant buoyancy frequency @xmath43 in the boussinesq approximation .    for investigating of a linear stability problem for the system ( [ maineq2 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ econ ] ) we omit nonlinear terms in the right part of the system and choose a solution in a form of normal mode : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an eigen value , describing growth rate of the mode , @xmath46 is a horizontal wave number , @xmath47 is a number of the mode and @xmath48 is an amplitude of the mode .",
    "after substitution of the expressions ( [ ncm2 ] ) into the system ( [ maineq2 ] ) we get a system of algebraic equations with solvability condition , having a form of a third order polynomial with respect to @xmath45 : @xmath49 here @xmath50 is a full wave number and @xmath51 is a constant : @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( [ dis2 ] ) is known as dispersive relation and has three roots , two of which can be complex conjugates for a sufficiently small value of @xmath53 . in the later case",
    "a hopf bifurcation take place when at some values of @xmath43 and @xmath53 real part of the complex conjugates roots turns to zero .",
    "it is true when @xmath54 , \\\\ \\omega^2 & = & \\frac{k^2}{\\varkappa^2}\\left(\\frac{1-\\tau}{1+\\sigma}\\right)- \\varepsilon^4\\tau^2\\varkappa^4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a hopf frequency .    because dispersive relation ( [ dis2 ] ) explicitly contains small parameter , we can choose one of the complex conjugates roots and express @xmath45 in the form of an asymptotic expansion by the powers of @xmath53 : @xmath56 after substitution of this expression in ( [ dis2 ] ) we have for @xmath57 : @xmath58    where constants are : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting to note , that when @xmath61 functions @xmath62 are positive .",
    "the growth rate , caused by thermohaline convective instability can be written as follows  @xcite : @xmath63 one can see ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , that for a given mode with number @xmath47 , the growth rate is maximal for some @xmath46 , which determines horizontal size of the most prominent convective cells .",
    "also the first convective mode has maximal growth rate , so that convective cells tend to be tall and thin .",
    "really about 30 first modes for @xmath64 have positive growth rate ( fig . [ figa ] ) , but the most prominent cells any way will be tall and thin , as having relatively more large rate of growth . for simplicity",
    "further we consider only the first convective mode .",
    "although above developed perturbation approach gives qualitatively true estimates , for more accurate results one should immediately solve algebraic equation ( [ dis2 ] ) .",
    "rewrite it in another form , with new introduced variables @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 roots of this equation depend on parameter @xmath69 , so that finally @xmath45 depends on horizontal wave number @xmath70 .",
    "consider actual oceanographical system such as an inversion of thermohaline staircase .",
    "let it has thickness @xmath71 cm and temperature difference @xmath72 , also @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case @xmath75 and non - dimensional critical buoyancy frequency @xmath76 . for @xmath77",
    "the most unstable mode has @xmath78 and width of convective cell @xmath79  cm",
    ". for comparison formula ( [ inc ] ) gives @xmath80 , i.e. somewhat less than the exact value . from ( [ inc ] )",
    "one can extract dependence of @xmath81 from @xmath43 , having form @xmath82^{1/4}$ ] .    from picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) one can easily see , that when value of @xmath43 becomes slightly small than its critical value @xmath83 , value of @xmath81 abruptly ( as @xmath84 ) increases and becomes maximal at @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath43 becomes even more less @xmath81 decreases to @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath81 is nearly independent of @xmath43 in considered case .",
    "this result for thermohaline convection at large @xmath13 is sufficiently different from that for small @xmath13 , when critical wave number is @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "for our case typical wave numbers are of the order @xmath89 .",
    "this estimate is more accurate , than mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "thus convective cells for large @xmath13 have tall and thin geometry from linear stability analysis",
    ". physically one can understand this effect from consideration that when rayleigh numbers are large , the buoyancy forces acting vertically are also large in comparison with forces of inertia of liquid particles determining width of cells .",
    "now we will study nonlinear vertical modulations of amplitude of our tall thin convective cells .    at first , introduce new small parameter , extracted from geometry of the convective cells : @xmath90 .",
    "rescale variables @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( prime will be omitted ) , and introduce one more small parameter @xmath94 . after changing of the space scale from @xmath0 to @xmath95 basic system ( [ maineq2 ] )",
    "appears in the form : @xmath96 at second , introduce slow vertical variable @xmath97 and slow time @xmath98 . in accordance with multi - scale decomposition technique",
    "we get prolonged derivatives @xcite : @xmath99 let buoyancy frequency somewhat less than its critical value @xmath100 .",
    "parameter @xmath101 here is a forcing of the system .",
    "equations ( [ maineq3 ] ) now get a form : @xmath102 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & ( \\partial_t - e^2\\partial_x^2)\\theta - \\partial_x\\psi = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad - ej_z(\\psi,\\theta ) - e^2(\\partial_t - e^2\\partial_z^2)\\theta , \\\\ & & ( \\partial_t - \\tau e^2\\partial_x^2)\\xi - \\partial_x\\psi = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad - ej_z(\\psi,\\xi ) - e^2(\\partial_t - \\tau e^2\\partial_z^2)\\xi . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solutions of these equations we will find as the asymptotic sets by powers of the small parameter @xmath103 : @xmath104 after substitution of these expressions into equations ( [ maineq4 ] ) collect terms at the same powers of @xmath103 . as a result we have systems of equations for determining of the terms of the sets ( [ sets ] ) .",
    "thus , at @xmath105 we have following system : @xmath106 choose for this system solution in the form of normal convective mode travelling to the right , with constants of integration @xmath107 and @xmath108 , depending on slow variables . @xmath109 here wave number @xmath110 is a horizontal wave number , corresponding to the most unstable waves of convection , and maximal value of @xmath111 from choice of the space scale , related with convective cells .",
    "it is attained when @xmath85 .",
    "parameters of the normal mode ( [ anz ] ) are related as follows : @xmath112 last formula is actually the dispersive relation ( [ dis2 ] ) , but for an infinitesimal vertical wave number . also for critical buoyancy frequency @xmath113 and wave frequency @xmath114",
    "we have : @xmath115    system of equations at @xmath116 is the same as ( [ eq_e1 ] ) and does not lead to any new results .",
    "system at @xmath117 is : @xmath118 after substitution into the right parts of these equations expressions ( [ anz ] ) we get a system with resonating right parts , breaking regularity of the asymptotic expansions ( [ sets ] ) .",
    "the condition of the absence of secular terms in this case takes form of so called abc system @xcite ( intermediate calculations are omitted ) : @xmath119 here coefficients are : @xmath120 , \\\\",
