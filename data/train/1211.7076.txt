    "recently there has been several efforts to understand the problem of quantum or thermal quench @xcite in strongly coupled field theories using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used to explore two interesting issues .",
    "the first relates to the question of thermalization . in this problem",
    "one typically considers a coupling in the hamiltonian which varies appreciably with time over some finite time interval .",
    "starting with a nice initial state ( e.g. the vacuum ) the question is whether the system evolves into some steady state and whether this steady state resembles a thermal state in a suitably defined sense . in the bulk description",
    "a time dependent coupling of the boundary field theory is a time dependent boundary condition .",
    "for example , with an initial ads this leads to black hole formation under suitable conditions .",
    "this is a holographic description of thermalization , which has been widely studied over the past several years @xcite with other initial conditions as well .",
    "many interesting applications of ads / cft duality involve a subset of bulk fields whose backreaction to gravity can be ignored , so that they can be treated in a _",
    "probe approximation_. one set of examples concern probe branes in ads which lead to hypermultiplet fields in the original dual field theory .",
    "even though the background does not change in the leading order , it turns out that thermalization of the hypermultiplet sector is still visible - this manifests itself in the formation of apparent horizons on the worldvolume @xcite .",
    "the second issue relates to quench across critical points @xcite .",
    "consider for example starting in a gapped phase , with a parameter in the hamiltonian varying slowly compared to the initial gap , bringing the system close to a value of the parameter where there would be an equilibrium critical point .",
    "as one comes close to this critical point , adiabaticity is inevitably broken .",
    "kibble and zurek @xcite argued that in the critical region the dynamics reflects universal features leading to scaling of various quantities .",
    "these arguments are based on rather drastic approximations , and for strongly coupled systems there is no theoretical framework analogous to renormalization group which leads to such scaling . for two - dimensional theories which are",
    "_ suddenly _ quenched to a critical point , powerful techniques of boundary conformal field theory have been used in @xcite to show that ratios of relaxation times of one point functions , as well as the length / time scales associated with the behavior of two point functions of different operators , are given in terms of ratios of their conformal dimensions at the critical point , and hence universal .    in @xcite",
    "quench dynamics in the critical region of a finite chemical potential holographic critical point was studied in a probe approximation .",
    "the `` phenomenological '' model used was that of @xcite which involves a neutral scalar field with quartic self - coupling with a mass - squared lying in the range @xmath4 in the background of a _ charged _ @xmath5 black brane .",
    "the self coupling is large so that the backreaction of the scalar dynamics on the background geometry can be ignored .",
    "the background maxwell field gives rise to a nonzero chemical potential in the boundary field theory .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for low enough temperatures , this system undergoes a critical phase transition at a mass @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath7 the scalar field condenses , in a manner similar to holographic superfluids @xcite .",
    "the critical point at @xmath8 is a standard mean field transition at any non - zero temperature , and becomes a berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless transition at zero temperature , as in several other examples of quantum critical transitions . in @xcite",
    "the critical point was probed by turning on a time dependent source for the dual operator , with the mass kept exactly at the critical value , i.e. a time dependent boundary value of one of the modes of the bulk scalar .",
    "the source asymptotes to constant values at early and late times , and crosses the critical point at zero source at some intermediate time .",
    "the rate of time variation @xmath0 is slow compared to the initial gap .",
    "as expected , adiabaticity fails as the equilibrium critical point at vanishing source is approached .",
    "however , it was shown that for any non - zero temperature and small enough @xmath0 , the bulk solution in the critical region can be expanded in _ fractional _",
    "powers of @xmath0 .",
    "to lowest order in this expansion , the dynamics is dominated by a single mode - the zero mode of the linearized bulk equation , which appears exactly at @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting dynamics of this zero mode is in fact a _ dissipative _ landau - ginsburg dynamics with a dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 , and the order parameter was shown to obey kibble - zurek type scaling .",
    "the work of @xcite is at finite temperature - the dissipation in this model is of course due to the presence of a black hole horizon and is expected at any finite temperature .",
    "it is interesting to ask what happens at zero temperatures .",
    "it turns out that the model of @xcite used in @xcite becomes subtle at zero temperature . in this case",
    ", there is no conventional adiabatic expansion even away from the critical point ( though there is a different low energy expansion , as in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the susceptibility is finite at the transition , indicating there is no zero mode . while it should be possible to examine quantum quench in this model by numerical methods ,",
    "we have not been able to get much analytic insight .    in this paper",
    "we study a different model of a quantum critical point , which is a variation of the model of insulator - superconductor transition of @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite involves a _ charged _ scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with a negative cosmological constant and a maxwell field .",
    "one of the spatial directions is compact with some radius @xmath9 , and in addition one can have a non - zero temperature @xmath10 and a non - zero chemical potential @xmath11 corresponding to the boundary value of the maxwell field . in the absence of the scalar field this model has a line of hawking - page type first order phase transitions in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane which separates an ( hot ) ads soliton and a ( charged ) black brane .",
    "exactly on the @xmath12 line , the two phases correspond to the ads soliton with a constant maxwell scalar potential , and an extremal black hole . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the presence of a minimally coupled charged scalar , the phase diagram changes .",
    "when the charge is large the scalar and the gauge fields can be regarded as probe fields which do not affect the geometry .",
    "now there is a phase with a trivial scalar and a phase with a scalar condensate . in the boundary theory",
    "the latter is a superfluid phase .",
    "this phase transition persists at zero temperature , where it separates an unbroken phase at low chemical potential and a broken phase - in both cases the background geometry is the ads soliton , while the gauge field is non - trivial in the superfluid phase .",
    "the phase diagram is given in figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "the idea now is to probe the dynamics of this insulator - superfluid transition at zero temperature by turning on a time dependent source for the operator dual to the charged field .",
    "so long as the scalar is minimally coupled and the charge @xmath13 is large , this would involve analyzing a coupled set of equations of the scalar field and the gauge field .    however , it turns out that a slight modification of the model allows us to ignore the backreaction of the scalar to the gauge field as well .",
    "this involves the introduction of a quartic self coupling of the scalar @xmath14 .",
    "then in the regime @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the gravitational coupling ) , we can consider the dynamics of the charged scalar in isolation .    in this work",
    "we first show that in this regime of the parameters the insulator - superfluid transition persists . concretely , for a sufficiently small negative @xmath18 , there is a critical value of the background chemical potential beyond which a nontrivial static solution for the scalar becomes thermodynamically favored . note that unlike other models of holographic superconductors the trivial solution does not become dynamically unstable .",
    "rather the non - trivial solution has lower energy .",
    "the transition is a standard mean field critical transition .",
    "the background geometry remains an ads soliton and the background gauge potential remains a constant , which is the chemical potential @xmath11 . at the transition ,",
    "the linearized equation has a zero mode solution which is regular both at the boundary and at the tip .",
    "we then turn on a time dependent boundary condition and find that the breakdown of adiabaticity for a small rate @xmath0 is characterized by exponents which are appropriate for a dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 . in a way quite similar to @xcite we find that in the critical region there is a new small @xmath0 expansion in fractional powers of @xmath0 , and the dynamics is once again dominated by a zero mode .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the zero mode now satisfy a coupled set of landau - ginsburg type equation with first order time derivatives .",
    "however the resulting system is oscillatory rather than dissipative - this is expected since the background geometry has no horizon so that we have is a _ closed _ system .",
    "the order parameter is shown to obey a kibble - zurek type scaling .",
    "finally we solve the bulk equations numerically and verify the scaling property obtained from the above small-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "thermal quench in holographic superfluids with backreaction has been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "this work addresses a different issue - here the quench is applied to the system in the ordered phase _",
    "away from the critical point _ and the resulting late time relaxation of the order parameter is studied .",
    "our emphasis is on probing a possible kibble - zurek scaling when the quench crosses the critical point .    in section 2",
    "we define the model and discuss its equilibrium phases . in section 3 we study quantum quench in this model by turning on a time dependent source , discuss the breakdown of adiabaticity and show that the critical region dynamics is dominated by the zero mode , leading to scaling behavior . in section 4 we present the results of a numerical solution of the equations , verifying the scaling behavior . in an appendix we discuss a landau - ginsburg model similar to the critical dynamics of our holographic model .",
    "the `` phenomenological '' holographic model we consider is a slight variation of the model of @xcite .",
    "the bulk action in @xmath19-dimensions is s = d^d+2x  , [ 1 - 1 ] where @xmath20 is a complex scalar field and @xmath21 is an abelian gauge field , and the other notations are standard . henceforth we will use @xmath22 units .",
    "one of the spatial directions , which we will denote by @xmath23 will be considered to be compact .",
    "we will consider the regime q^2  ,  ^2  . in this regime",
    "the scalar field is a probe field , and its backreaction to both the metric and the gauge field can be ignored .      the background metric and the gauge field can be then obtained by solving the einstein - maxwell equations with the appropriate periodicity condition on @xmath23 . it is well known that there are two possible solutions .",
    "the first is the @xmath24 soliton , ds^2 & = & + r^2 ( -dt^2 + _ i=1^d-1 dx_i^2 ) + r^2 f_sl(r ) d^2  , + f_sl(r ) & = & 1 - ( ) ^d+1  , + a_t & = &  , [ 1 - 2 ] with constant parameters @xmath11 and @xmath25 .",
