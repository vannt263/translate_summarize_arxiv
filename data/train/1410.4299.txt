    ". complex crns exchanging matter ( and energy ) with the environment are of prime importance in biology , _ e.g. , _",
    "metabolic @xcite , neural @xcite , gene @xcite and protein networks @xcite .",
    "comparatively small - scale crns are ubiquitous in the form of tautomeric equilibria , important in many biological processes , _ e.g. _ , in the chemical versatility of thiamin @xcite and in spontaneous mutation @xcite .",
    "open systems involve flow of material , even in the steady state ( ss ) , and necessarily describe out - of - equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "so , they continue to play a fundamental role in the development of non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and , in turn , to understand the effects of such far - from - equilibrium scenarios on system functionality @xcite .",
    "the major points of departure in the behavior of an open system compared to a closed system are the following : ( i ) open systems can support a ( non - equilibrium ) ss whereas closed systems attain thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite ; ( ii ) the ss composition depends on the dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the values of the dynamical parameters ( rate constants and matter flows ) ; but , in an equilibrium state , the concentrations are constrained by thermodynamics , _ i.e. _ , by equilibrium constants ( ratios of rate constants ) .",
    "the wealth of behaviors emerging in such ( non - equilibrium ) ss have generated , over the years , a lot of attention regarding its role in biochemical environments residing far - from - equilibrium .",
    "some notable applications are kinetic proofreading @xcite , energy transduction @xcite , optimization of reaction yield @xcite , information acquisition in dna replication @xcite etc .",
    "the theoretical modeling of open crns is often based on the chemiostatic condition @xcite that still holds a key place in the irreversible thermodynamic description of such networks @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , here concentrations of some of the reacting species are taken time - independent throughout the course of the reaction . in many instances ,",
    "this leads to a simplification of the problem by converting certain non - linear kinetic equations to linear ones @xcite . in this type of situation , however , the matter - exchange with the surroundings is _ not _ taken into account directly in the formulation of rate equations . here , though , we treat the kinetics by explicitly including the matter - flow .    in an open crn ,",
    "the build - up of reacting species depends on the system parameters .",
    "the latter include the rates of inflow , outflow and the reaction constants . here , we denote the total accumulated material inside the ( fixed ) reaction volume as the ` load ' .",
    "it is the sum of concentrations of all the species in the reaction medium . in a closed system , with mass - conservation being valid",
    ", the load remains the same throughout the course of the reaction .",
    "so , the concept of load is relevant only for open chemical systems where mass - conservation is broken .",
    "however , it seems that such a quantity did not attract much attention .",
    "the magnitude of the load is important because a high value of a component may lead to undesirable side - reactions such as aggregation ; the effects of activity coefficients get pronounced as well .",
    "also , for a given ss flow , there must be an upper limit of the load which the reaction volume can sustain .",
    "hence , it is important to understand the roles of the network structure and system parameters in governing the ss load .",
    "this knowledge can then be utilized to formulate strategies to reduce the load by properly modifying the network for an optimized flow @xcite .",
    "this is also crucial in traffic networks where one can take the total number of vehicles in various terminuses or traffic signals as the load .",
    "however , the plan of adding new paths ( roads ) to trim the load and/or improve the flow does _ not _ succeed always . in the context of traffic flow ,",
    "addition of a road of much better quality may lead to an _ increase _ in the overall travel time from a given source to destination for each traveller .",
    "this is known as the braess paradox ( bp ) @xcite , after dietrich braess , who introduced this concept regarding traffic assignment problems .",
    "the bp also occurs in electrical , mechanical and thermal networks @xcite .",
    "for example , bp is manifested in the conductance drop of a branched semiconductor mesoscopic network when an extra branch is added @xcite .",
    "a recent study also reports bp in a chemical system where an additional reaction step results in the lowering of product - formation rate @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider an open crn , starting from a basic four - node structure as shown in fig.[fig0 ] .",
    "the dashed ( red ) line bc in fig.[fig0 ] represents the extra path which can be uni- or bi - directional .",
    "specific chemical examples of such networks are tautomeric ( and conformational ) equilibria of hydrazones derived from hydroxyl naphthaldehydes where the extra path is absent @xcite and tautomeric equilibria of 6-(2-pyrrolyl)pyridazines where the extra path is present @xcite .",
    "keto - enol and imine - enamine tautomerism of 2- , 3- and 4-phenacylpyridines @xcite and imine - enamine tautomerism of the enzyme glyoxylate carboligase @xcite also involve four - node networks or subnetworks with or without the extra path .",
    "our goal here is to study the effect of the extra path on the load , _",
    "i.e. , _ the total concentration of the reacting species , at ss . the presence of the extra path is expected to decrease the load as it opens up a new avenue of transport .",
    "thus , a rise in the load when the extra path is operative can be designated as a bp - like behavior . in sec.2",
    ", we first study a crn similar to that shown in fig.[fig0 ] where , except the extra path , all the other steps are irreversible . in sec.3 ,",
    "some of the steps are made reversible .",
    "the network is extended to a six - node one in sec.4 . in all the cases , we find that bp - like features appear with a qualitatively similar pattern . in sec.5 , the methodology is applied to a crn of biological relevance .",
    "the overall outcomes are finally summarized in sec.6 .",
    "a simple crn is shown in fig.[sch1 ] .",
    "we call this network scheme i. here , @xmath0 is the _ constant _ rate of injection of species a into the reaction system of fixed volume and @xmath1 are the ( first - order ) rate constants .",
    "species e goes out of the system via a process having rate constant @xmath2",
    ".    the time - dependent concentrations of species a , b , c , e are denoted by @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , the load @xmath4 of this system is @xmath5 the thermodynamic fluxes@xcite @xmath6 are given by @xmath7 @xmath8 the reason for introducing these fluxes will become clear later .",
    "now , the kinetic equations can be expressed in terms of @xmath9 as follows @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 at steady state ( ss ) , we have @xmath14 and hence , @xmath15 ( the ss values are represented by omitting the time - argument ) . from eqs.([j1])-([e ] ) , one gets the ss concentrations as @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 it is important to note that , the ss concentrations do _ not _ depend on the initial condition , _",
    "i.e. _ , the set of concentrations at @xmath20 . in what follows",
    ", we mainly concentrate on the load z defined in eq.([zt ] ) at the ss .",
    "our focus now is on the reaction path bc with rate constants @xmath21 that acts as the extra path .",
    "it is expected that , presence of this extra path should enhance the transport efficiency and hence decrease the load @xmath22 of the system at ss . to measure the effect of extra path on @xmath22",
    ", we introduce the load - difference @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the value of @xmath22 when @xmath26 . for finite non - zero values of @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 , @xmath23 is expected to be positive .",
    "we will investigate whether this is _ always _ the case . if , for a set of parameter values , @xmath23 comes out to be negative ( or zero )",
    ", then it is a counter - intuitive behavior analogous to the bp .",
    "we call any such region of parameter space with @xmath29 as the bp zone",
    ". the ss concentrations at @xmath26 are similarly denoted by a zero superscript with @xmath30 .",
    "using eqs.([bss])-([css ] ) , @xmath31 , the flux of the extra path , at the ss reads as @xmath32 @xmath33 means the ( net ) flow in the extra path is in the direction @xmath34 and @xmath35 indicates that the flow is reversed .",
    "now , using eqs.([ass])-([j5ss ] ) , we can relate @xmath23 with @xmath31 by @xmath36      from eq.([j5ss ] ) and eq.([del1 ] ) , one can see that @xmath23 , viewed as a function of @xmath37 , becomes zero at @xmath38 @xmath31 is zero at the first solution in eq.([del0 ] ) .",
    "so @xmath23 _ changes sign twice _ as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath37 is much smaller than the other rate constants , it follows from eqs.([j5ss])-([del1 ] ) that @xmath23 is large and positive . as @xmath37 increases , @xmath23 decreases and becomes zero at the first or the second value of @xmath37 given in eq.([del0 ] ) , depending on whether @xmath39 or not . between these two values , @xmath23 remains _",
    "negative_. thus , the extra path leads to an _ increase _ in load over _ a finite region _ of parameter space .",
    "we call this region the _ finite _ bp zone .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath23 shows a similar behavior as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "however , as a function of any other rate constant , @xmath23 changes sign _ only _ once and , depending on the parameter values , it can remain negative for a large range , approaching zero asymptotically .",
    "this results in an _",
    "infinite _ bp zone . according to eq.([del1",
    "] ) , @xmath23 vanishes for @xmath41 and the system is _ always _ in the bp zone .",
    "this is interesting , as then one can _ never _ ` gain ' by adding the extra path whatever be its ( or other paths ) characteristics .",
    "it is important to note also from eqs.([j5ss])-([del1 ] ) that , when other parameters are kept fixed , @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the gain in adding the extra path is higher for a larger @xmath0 in a non - bp zone ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "but , so is the loss when the system resides in a bp zone .",
    "this feature is depicted in fig.[f1 ] by plotting @xmath23 as a function @xmath37 for two values of @xmath0 ( in @xmath43 ) .",
    "the bp zone is indicated explicitly in the figure , bounded by the two values of @xmath37 given by eq.([del0 ] ) .",
    "thus , for a network in the bp zone , the increase in load ( after inclusion of extra path ) can be extremely hazardous if it reaches or surpasses the inherent capacity .",
    "one can see from fig.[f1 ] that the variation of @xmath23 is much sharper at smaller values of @xmath37 .",
    "so , the transition from non - bp zone to bp zone can occur by a very minor alteration of @xmath37 , particularly at higher @xmath0 .",
    "this sensitive dependence can lead even to a network breakdown .",
    "we have plotted @xmath23 in fig.[f2](a ) along with @xmath31 in fig.[f2](b ) for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "the relative positioning of the two points around which the sign changes of @xmath23 occur are given by eq.([del0 ] ) again .",
    "the bp zones are thus _ finite_. it follows from eq.([j5ss ] ) that , at large values of @xmath37 ( compared to the other rate constants ) , @xmath31 becomes independent of @xmath37 and then , using eq.([del1 ] ) , one gets the limiting ( positive ) value of @xmath23 as @xmath46      in the rest of this section , we explore some specific cases .",
    "this will further improve our understanding of the variation of @xmath23 and the significance of the bp zone .",
    "this situation arises in an irreversible extra path .",
    "one finds here that @xmath31 can not change sign and remains either positive ( @xmath48 ) or negative ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "further , @xmath31 becomes independent of @xmath37 for @xmath48 ( see fig.[f2](d ) ) .",
    "so , @xmath23 changes sign only once at @xmath41 . for @xmath47",
    ", @xmath23 is positive at low values of @xmath37 , becomes zero at @xmath41 and then negative .",
    "this is shown in fig.[f2](c ) . from eq.([delk4 ] ) , it follows that @xmath49 at large @xmath37 .",
    "hence , if @xmath50 , @xmath29 and the system supports an _ infinite _ bp zone . on the other hand , for @xmath48",
    ", @xmath23 is negative at small @xmath37 and @xmath51 again at @xmath41 ( see fig.[f2](c ) ) .",
    "so , the network remains in a _ finite _ bp zone for @xmath52 .",
    "afterwards , @xmath23 becomes positive and attains the value given in eq.([delk4 ] ) in the large-@xmath37 limit .",
    "hence , the _ nature of directionality _ of the extra path strongly affects the emergence and sustenance of the bp zone .",
    "we mention that , when viewed as a function of @xmath40 , the features simply get reversed .",
    "also , for vanishing @xmath27 or @xmath28 , @xmath23 _ can not _ change sign as a function of @xmath53 or @xmath54 ( see eq.([del0 ] ) ) . when these parameters are varied , the system remains entirely either in the bp or in the non - bp zone , depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath55 .",
    "for example , when @xmath47 , @xmath50 , the system remains _ entirely _ in the bp zone as a function of @xmath53 . however , if @xmath56 , then the bp zone _ vanishes completely_. these properties are shown in fig.[f2a](a ) .",
    "similar plots are shown in fig.[f2a](b ) for @xmath54 at @xmath48 .",
    "for further details , we refer the reader to table 1 .",
    "in this special case , the two points given in eq.([del0 ] ) merge to a single point , @xmath41 . using eq.([j5ss ] ) and eq.([del1 ] ) along with the above condition , we get @xmath58 hence , in this situation , @xmath23 _ can not _ be negative .",
    "the presence of the extra path decreases the load for all values of @xmath37 except at @xmath41 where @xmath51 and the bp zone reduces to a point .",
    "these features are shown in fig.[f3 ] for specific values of the relevant parameters : @xmath59 , all in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this diagonally symmetric case resembles the networks commonly used to show the occurrence of bp @xcite . here",
    ", the points where @xmath23 is zero are given by @xmath64 hence , @xmath23 changes sign twice as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "if either @xmath27 or @xmath28 vanishes , then @xmath23 can change sign once ( at @xmath41 ) .",
    "the two points in eq.([del01 ] ) merge at @xmath65 whence @xmath66 .",
    "so , the main results remain unchanged in this symmetric case .",
    "a summary of all our findings on scheme i can be found in table 1 .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .5 cm    .summary of the results in the various cases of scheme i regarding the appearance of bp zone as a function of different system parameters and the dependence on the nature of extra path .",
    "here , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our context , the decomposition steps @xmath72 and @xmath73 constitute the extra paths ( shown by dashed , red lines in fig.[schex ] ) .",
    "these paths result in the _ indiscriminate _ formation of species c and e from b and a , respectively .",
    "as the enzymatic degradations are stereospecific , the decomposition steps appear to be disadvantageous .",
    "next , we will try to understand whether these pathways can have some _ functional _ role , _",
    "i.e. , _ the system can use them for some kind of advantage .",
    "in what follows , the concentrations of different enzymes ( and other species ) involved in various steps of the network are taken as constants ( acting as chemiostats ) and included in the pseudo - first - order rate constants @xmath1 .",
    "the variations of @xmath1 are thus naturally linked to the corresponding _ parametric _ variations in enzyme concentration .",
    "the ss concentrations are determined following similar procedures as earlier .",
    "they are given by @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 using eq.([scon ] ) , the effect of the extra paths is determined by @xmath23 as @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 with the symbols having the same meanings as before . here",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81    now , we investigate the possibility of bp zones in this network . as @xmath82",
    ", it follows from eqs.([delex])-([s123 ] ) that , @xmath23 ca nt be zero for @xmath83 when viewed as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "actually , here @xmath23 remains positive and there is _ no scope _ for bp zone to develop .",
    "equation ( [ s123 ] ) suggests that this will occur for sufficiently large @xmath84 values compared to the other rate constants .",
    "hence , the _ indiscriminate decomposition pathways can play a functional role in reducing the ss load of the network_. if @xmath85 , then it is possible for @xmath23 to change sign twice with the variation of @xmath40 and _ finite _ bp zones appear .",
    "see fig.[delp ] .",
    "the numerator in eq.([delex ] ) is also quadratic in @xmath53 .",
    "it can be easily checked that , depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath40 and @xmath37 , @xmath23 can change sign once or twice with @xmath53 . in this case , _ infinite _ bp zones can also emerge . therefore",
    ", the variation in concentrations of different enzymes affects the system load in a distinct manner .",
    "as there are two extra paths , another interesting feature is the effect of one in presence of the other .",
    "let us first take the extra path bc .",
    "one obtains the effect of the bc path in presence of the ae path ( @xmath86 ) as @xmath87 @xmath88 becomes zero at @xmath41 and changes sign once against @xmath40 or @xmath37 .",
    "_ infinite _ bp zone appears when viewed as a function of @xmath40 whereas , the system supports a _ finite _ bp zone as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "next , we study the effect of the ae path in presence of the bc path ( @xmath89 ) . in this case",
    ", the load - difference becomes @xmath90 @xmath91>0 .",
    "\\label{del22}\\ ] ] thus , in presence of the bc path , addition of the path ae _ always _ reduces the ss load and _ no _ bp zone exists .",
    "the above - mentioned features indicate that the ss load can play a major role , along with other factors , in governing the evolution of optimized reaction steps in living systems .      here , we make a brief survey on the distribution of the load over the crn , _",
    "i.e. , _ on the individual ss concentrations . according to eq.([scon ] ) , only @xmath92 depend on the parameters of the extra paths . in absence",
    "the extra paths ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 increase whereas @xmath95 decreases .",
    "however , their _ relative change in magnitudes _ dictate the fate of @xmath23 . in fig.[fpop ]",
    ", the changes in the ss concentrations due to the addition of the extra paths are shown at two values of @xmath40 . for the parameters chosen , particularly at the small @xmath2 value , @xmath96 and",
    "hence not shown in the figure . both in the top and bottom panels of fig.[fpop ] , we have @xmath97 .",
    "but , the system is in the bp zone only in the bottom panel .",
    "this shows that , focusing on a single species concentration can be misleading in detecting the bp zone .      before concluding",
    ", we touch upon the dynamics of the load .",
    "the individual time - evolutions of the reacting species of scheme iv are determined numerically .",
    "the load @xmath4 is plotted in fig.[fzt ] as a function of time for three different cases : @xmath98 .",
    "the set of parameters are the same as in the previous two subsections . in all the cases",
    ", @xmath23 shows a monotonic rise till the system reaches the ss . when the system is in the non - bp zone ( fig.[fzt]a ) , @xmath22 remains lower throughout if extra paths are present .",
    "similarly , in the bp zone ( fig.[fzt]c ) , @xmath22 is greater in presence of extra paths during the whole reaction progression .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath51 ( fig.[fzt]b ) , @xmath22 follows virtually the same time - course with and without the extra paths .",
    "thus , regarding the bp zones , the load dynamics in our case is in conformity with the results obtained so far and does not provide any qualitatively new information .",
    "however , for brevity , we refrain from a detailed analysis of the load dynamics as a function of various system parameters .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the effect of additional paths on the ss load of open crns .",
    "the problem is related to the handling of traffic flow in general and particularly the paradoxical case illustrated by braess , where inclusion of extra routes increases the travel time . in an equivalent manner , we have found bp - like behavior in the ss load which , instead of dropping , can get raised or remains the same due to the presence of extra paths .",
    "the region of parameter space where this kind of behavior occurs is denoted as the bp zone .",
    "taking some basic networks , we have explored the roles of the system parameters in governing the materialization of such zones .",
    "first of all , the load difference @xmath23 is found to be proportional to the rate of influx @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the bp - zone ( as well as the non - bp zone ) grows with @xmath0 . investigating the effects of the paths forming network - edges ,",
    "we have found an appealing aspect regarding the variation of the associated rate constants .",
    "for some of them ( @xmath55 in scheme i ) , the bp zone is _ finite _ as @xmath23 changes sign twice .",
    "it can even reduce to a point .",
    "for the others ( @xmath99 in scheme i ) , @xmath23 can change sign _ only _ once and then the bp zone can turn _ infinite_. making some steps reversible and symmetric ( as in scheme ii ) generates _ finite _ bp zones as a function of all the rate constants of the network edges .",
    "however , for an irreversible extra path , @xmath23 can change sign only once in both the schemes . then _",
    "finite _ bp zones become _ infinite _ again .",
    "the basic features are shown to remain unchanged in an extended six - node version of the network ( scheme iii ) .",
    "the nature of the extra path is of immense importance regarding the existence of the bp zone .",
    "this is manifested in the intimate connection between @xmath23 and @xmath31 , the flux associated with the extra path ( see eq.([del1 ] ) and eq.([delnew ] ) ) . for a reversible extra path , the bp zone",
    "_ can not _ span the entire parameter ( @xmath1 ) range although it can stretch infinitely .",
    "this is not always the case with an irreversible extra path .",
    "depending on the direction of the extra path , the system can show two extreme behaviors .",
    "( i ) it is _ always _ in the bp zone over the whole range of some parameter ; ( ii ) it does _ not _ support any bp zone over the whole range of the same parameter . between ( i ) and ( ii ) ,",
    "the kind of behavior actually shown by the system depends on the relative values of other parameters ( case of @xmath99 in scheme i , see table 1 ) .",
    "this kind of ` switching ' response of the system to the addition of extra path is highly interesting as well as of huge practical impact in the designing and planning of network geometries .",
    "we have also applied the methodology on the important biochemical network of uric acid degradation . from the detailed analyses of the corresponding crn in an open system framework",
    ", we propose that some of the spontaneous decomposition steps of the intermediates can have _ functional roles _ in reducing the ss load . as the magnitude of the ss load is essential for the physical sustainability of the reaction medium",
