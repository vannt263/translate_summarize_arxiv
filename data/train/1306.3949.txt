    "observations of gunn - peterson absorption troughs @xcite detected in the spectra of quasars at redshifts @xmath1 @xcite have been interpreted as representing the end stages of the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation implies a higher typical redshift for reionization @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that reionization was likely a complex process that occurred over a range in cosmic times with strong local variations .",
    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are produced by the deaths of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and offer the promise of being important probes of this process with their highly luminous afterglows being detectable to large redshifts @xcite .",
    "the most useful probe of the igm opacity at high redshifts has been ly@xmath2  seen in absorption of quasars , but quasars have some disadvantages as probes . at low redshift , quasar measurements can interpolate across absorptions in the ly@xmath2  forest , but at higher redshift the continuum is so highly absorbed that the proper level has to be inferred .",
    "the smooth power - law spectra of grb afterglows are intrinsically much simpler than the complicated spectra of quasars , which have emission lines and sometimes broad absorption . aside from practical matters",
    ", quasars may not be unbiased probes of the high - redshift universe .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) emission from quasars ionizes the region around them through the proximity effect .",
    "in addition , @xcite has argued that the highest - redshift quasars are hosted by massive dark matter halos that are highly biased tracers of the underlying matter distribution . even ignoring the ionizing radiation from the quasar",
    ", he finds that typical high - redshift quasars are located in regions that are overionized relative to the average due to the associated large - scale structure .",
    "grbs are associated with sites of massive - star formation and will be more widely distributed at high redshift in galaxies of lower masses @xcite than the rare massive black holes needed to power the most luminous quasars .",
    "there are now only three spectroscopically - confirmed grbs at @xmath16 despite active follow - up efforts of suspected high-@xmath0 bursts : grb 050904 at @xmath0=6.295 @xcite , grb 080913 at @xmath0=6.733 @xcite , and grb 090423 at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in addition , grb  090429b has a photometric redshift of @xmath189.4 @xcite .",
    "these objects have proven the existence of grbs at these early epochs , and are beginning to demonstrate the application of grbs to studies of star formation in the early universe @xcite . however , despite their promise as bright probes @xcite , high-@xmath0 grb afterglow studies of the igm to date @xcite have been hindered by the limited signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the available spectra .",
    "this has now changed with the discovery of grb  130606a  and our follow - up observations .    the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered on grb  130606a  on 2013 june 6 at 21:04:39 ( all dates and times are ut ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy emission was extended , with a duration of @xmath19 = 277@xmath2019  s as seen by bat @xcite , firmly establishing grb  130606a  as a member of the long - duration population of grbs .",
    "subsequent ground - based followup observations located an optical transient ( e.g. , @xcite ) that was brighter in the near - infrared ( nir ; @xcite ) .",
    "initial spectroscopy from the gran telescopio canarias @xcite revealed that the afterglow redshift was @xmath21 , which was subsequently refined to @xmath22 by several groups , including ours @xcite .",
    "we present an analysis of the optical spectra of the afterglow of grb  130606a , the first high - redshift grb spectra to be comparable in quality to those of typical @xmath1 quasars . in section 2 , we describe the data acquisition and reduction .",
    "we analyze the metal absorption lines from the host galaxy and intervening igm systems in section 3 , and set constraints on the abundances in the ism of the @xmath22 host galaxy . in section 4",
    ", we measure the properties of the ly@xmath2 , ly@xmath14 , and ly@xmath15  absorption of the igm and compare to previous observations of high - redshift quasars .",
    "we discuss the implications in section 5 .",
    "we observed the afterglow of grb  130606a  starting at 04:04 on 2013 june 7 using the blue channel spectrograph @xcite on the 6.5-m mmt .",
    "we obtained a set of four 1200  s spectra as grb  130606a  rose from airmass 1.22 to 1.08 with a midpoint time of 04:45 ( @xmath23  hr after the bat trigger ) .",
    "the 832 lines / mm grating and lp530 order - blocking filter were used to cover the range 7460@xmath49360   .",
    "our 1-wide slit gave a spectral resolution of 2.0    full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) and was oriented at the parallactic angle @xcite to reduce effects of differential atmospheric dispersion .",
    "we acquired the source by taking advantage of the excellent pointing of the mmt to offset from a nearby bright star to the coordinates for the afterglow rapidly distributed by @xcite .",
    "these coordinates are somewhat offset from the precise radio position given by @xcite , possibly indicating that the object was not fully in the slit .",
    "we subsequently obtained four 1800  s observations of grb  130606a  using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8-m gemini - north telescope , with a midpoint of 10:17 on 2013 june 7 ( @xmath24  hr ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained in nod - and - shuffle mode @xcite with the r400 grating and rg610 order - blocking filter .",
    "we took advantage of the new red - sensitive deep depletion detectors to use a grating setup with coverage longward of 1@xmath25 m . the excellent seeing ( 0.5@xmath40.7 ) over the course of observations allowed us to have a spectral resolution of @xmath185    over the observed spectral range of 6200@xmath410500   .",
    "the grating angle was adjusted by 50    between the second and third observations to fill in ccd chip gaps .",
    "the 1-wide slit was oriented at a position angle of 90@xmath26 , but the airmass was low ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we use iraf to perform basic two - dimensional image processing and extract the spectra after removal of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "we apply flux calibrations and correct for telluric absorption using our own idl procedures .",
    "two aspects of the gmos data reduction require special attention .",
    "the first is that because gemini does not generally obtain standard stars at the time of observations , the variable atmospheric h@xmath28o absorption strength can lead to errors in the correction for telluric absorption in the strong band near 9400   .",
    "we obtain archival observations of the standard star bd@xmath2928  4211 and are careful to scale the h@xmath28o portion of the telluric correction separately from the correction at the o@xmath28 absorption bands .",
    "the second effect is that the gemini data were taken in nod - and - shuffle mode .",
    "we reduce the gemini data with two methods , once after applying the expected pairwise subtraction of the data from the two nod positions and once ignoring the nod pairs and treating each spectrum as a normal long - slit observation .",
    "the first method leads to better control of systematic sky subtraction errors produced by flat fielding errors and bright night sky emission lines , but comes at a cost of a factor of @xmath30 increase in the poisson errors in night sky dominated portions of the spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "we align and stack the two - dimensional frames taken with the same grating tilt angle prior to spectral extraction .",
    "the two reductions are highly consistent , so we splice them together at 8780   , using the second method at shorter wavelengths to obtain the best s / n , while the nod - and - shuffle reduction was used at longer wavelengths where the systematic residuals from sky subtraction are otherwise problematic",
    ".    we rebinned the calibrated one - dimensional spectra for each gmos grating setup to a common vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale and combined them on a pixel - by - pixel basis , weighted by the inverse variance . the final mmt and gmos",
    "spectra are plotted in figure  [ specfig ] .",
    "the absolute flux scale is uncertain , both due to our use of an archival standard star at gemini and the fading of the afterglow that is clearly evident during the observations .",
    "both spectra have been corrected for @xmath31  mag of galactic extinction @xcite . in the continuum between 8500 and 8600  ",
    ", the mmt spectrum has a median s / n per 0.71    pixel of @xmath1810 , while for the gemini data the median s / n per 1.38    pixel is @xmath1880 and decreasing to longer wavelengths .    before proceeding further ,",
    "we normalize the spectra by fitting a power - law continuum to wavelength intervals in the gemini spectrum redward of the ly@xmath2  break devoid of strong absorption lines .",
    "the best - fit continuum is shown as the thick red line and has a slope of @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 , although some curvature relative to a pure power law is evident .",
    "we divide both spectra by this continuum in all subsequent analysis .",
    "the two spectra from different instruments presented in figure  [ specfig ] are highly consistent with each other . both show a flat continuum ( in @xmath32 ) at long wavelengths that drops sharply down to zero between 8435 and 8405   ; flux detected blueward of 8405    is largely limited to wavelength intervals between 6500 and 7850   .",
    "this is indicative of absorption induced by the host galaxy at redshift @xmath3 and the ly@xmath2  forest at lower redshift .",
    "the normalized gmos spectrum , displayed in figure  [ linefig ] , exhibits numerous absorption lines redward of ly@xmath2  that arise in the host galaxy and intervening systems .",
    "we fit a local continuum and single gaussian profile to each absorption line in both the gemini and mmt spectra and list the results in table  [ linetab ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in line centroids and equivalent widths ( @xmath36 ) do not include continuum placement uncertainties .",
    "we are able to confidently detect , , * , , * , , * , and from the host galaxy , as well as the red wing of ly@xmath2  absorption at a similar redshift .",
    "a weighted average of the narrow , unblended , low - ionization lines gives a redshift for grb  130606a  of @xmath37 , a value which we adopt throughout this paper .",
    "the presence of fine - structure lines at this redshift identifies it as that of the grb because the lower levels for these transitions are not normally populated unless pumped by the uv emission from the grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "in addition to absorption from the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , we detect absorption from at least four intervening lower - redshift systems . @xcite",
    "previously reported two absorption systems at @xmath38 and 3.451 in x - shooter spectra .",
    "we confirm the existence of the first one through absorption from and at an average redshift of @xmath39 .",
    "we do not see the system at @xmath40 , although no strong absorption lines from it are expected in our observed wavelength range .",
    "in addition , we detect at least three more intervening systems , at weighted average redshifts of @xmath41 , 4.647@xmath200.001 , and 5.806@xmath200.001 . the @xmath0=5.806 // system is particularly interesting in light of recent observational work to find similar systems at these redshifts to probe metal enrichment of the igm associated with reionization @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath421548 from the @xmath0=4.647 system completely overlaps the * @xmath421265 absorption from the host and that weak @xmath422586 at @xmath0=2.3105 is also likely blended with @xmath421239 .",
    "one important advantage of the mmt data is that the host absorption lines are generally resolved , while the igm metal lines are not .",
    "we show some unblended line profiles in figure  [ profilefig ] . the and lines from lower - redshift absorbers have fwhms consistent with the spectral resolution of @xmath182   . however , the host @xmath421260 absorption has a fwhm equivalent to @xmath18120 km  s@xmath43 after subtraction of the instrumental width in quadrature .",
    "most of the host absorption lines appear to be consistent with a single absorption component , but the lines are both blueshifted relative to the low - ionization lines and have flat - bottomed profiles .",
    "they exhibit absorption spread across @xmath18200 km  s@xmath43 , which is unusually broad for absorption in grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "the gemini data can not clearly resolve these features although some variation in fwhm is apparent .",
    "in particular , the doublet shows some structure , with the stronger @xmath421394 line exhibiting a blue wing extending out to a blueshift of @xmath18300 km  s@xmath43 .",
    "the and profiles probably reflect absorption in a wind or outflow from the host galaxy .    the sharp cutoff of flux between 1215 and 1220    due to the wing of ly@xmath2  absorption in the host is indicative of a low hydrogen column density ( @xmath44@xmath45 ; all reported columns are in units of @xmath46 ) in the host galaxy .",
    "a fit to the hydrogen column in the gmos spectrum gives a best fit redshift of @xmath0=5.913@xmath200.001 , in excellent agreement with the results from the narrow metal lines , and @xmath44=19.93@xmath200.07 , which we adopt in the subsequent analysis .",
    "a fit to the mmt spectrum with the redshift fixed gives a consistent value of @xmath44=19.99 .",
    "this value is rather low for a grb host galaxy @xcite , as it falls below the cutoff of @xmath44=20.3 for a damped ly@xmath2  system ( dla ) . in the compilation of hydrogen column measurements of @xmath47 grb host galaxies presented by @xcite ,",
    "only 1 out of 12 objects ( grb 080913 ) has a lower @xmath44  of 19.84 @xcite .",

    "the point in figure  [ metalfig ] at @xmath68 from grb  050904 @xcite is of special interest because it represents the most complete abundance analysis of a galaxy at a redshift comparable to grb  130606a .",
    "@xcite measured the abundance pattern using the exact same lines we use here , except that they detect the lines , so systematic issues due to different tracers are minimized .",

    "it is interesting to note that even at these high redshifts , the isms of these star - forming galaxies show clear evidence of chemical enrichment .",
    "the spectra we present in figures  [ specfig ] and [ linefig ] exhibit a well - detected nir continuum that drops to near zero at 8400   , but then slowly rises to a peak near 7100    before turning over and dropping off blueward of that .",
    "this continuum slope in the absorbed part of the spectrum represents real evolution in the optical depth of the ly@xmath2  forest over the redshift range @xmath74 .",
    "the very high s / n of our data allow us to place constraints on the opacity of the igm to ly@xmath2  that are comparable to those from individual high - redshift quasars .",
    "we divide our gmos spectrum by the best - fit continuum marked on figure  [ specfig ] and then display the spectrum in figure  [ transfig ] with the wavelength scale converted to redshift relative to ly@xmath2 , ly@xmath14 , and ly@xmath15 .",
    "the transmitted flux is clearly broken up into a `` picket fence '' of individual windows of transmission through the ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "these windows are rare at @xmath75 , but become increasingly common at lower redshift until at @xmath76 they start to overlap .",
    "figure  [ specfig ] demonstrates the consistency of these windows of transmission in two spectra of different resolutions .",
    "comparison of the three lyman - series transitions shows that the pattern of transmission windows is generally the same over the limited overlap region , with the weaker higher - order lines having greater transmission than ly@xmath2 , as expected .",
    "there are two interesting exceptions .",
    "the first is that there is a weak window of transmission present near @xmath77 in both ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath15 , but not ly@xmath2 , in a redshift interval that is otherwise fairly dark .",
    "this is intriguingly close to the redshift of the @xmath0=5.806 system that we detect in metal lines , indicating a moderate local increase in ionization ( but not enough for ly@xmath2  to become transparent ) correlated with the same large scale structure hosting the absorber .",
    "spatial correlations between metal enrichment and ionization are predicted to be sensitive probes of the reionization process and the pollution of the igm by the earliest galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , there is a clear transmission window present in both ly@xmath2  and ly@xmath15  between @xmath0=5.69@xmath45.70 that is missing from ly@xmath14 .",
    "although this region falls squarely in the atmospheric b band , the spectrum has been corrected for telluric absorption and some flux might be expected to be detected in data of this quality . instead",
    ", we note that the ly@xmath2  absorption associated with the @xmath78 system we detect in metal lines would lie at exactly this redshift relative to ly@xmath14 .",
    "this serves as a cautionary reminder that some absorption we attribute to the lyman series can be due to either metal lines or ly@xmath2  at lower redshift .",
    "we now compare the transmission along the line of sight to this high - redshift grb with previous studies using high - redshift quasars as background light sources .",
    "@xcite used high - quality moderate and high - resolution keck spectra of a sample of quasars to measure the mean transmission of ly@xmath2 .",
    "she computed the average transmission in 15    bins in the rest frame of each quasar between 1080 and 1185    ( limits chosen to avoid ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath2  proximity effects from each quasar ) and measured the mean and its variation along different lines of sight .",
    "the thick solid line in figure  [ lyafig ] marks the mean transmission measured from the quasars and the thick gray band marks the observed minimum and maximum values in her sample .",
    "we measure the transmission in wavelength bins of the same size over the interval 1035@xmath41200   .",
    "the low @xmath44  of the host of grb  130606a   allows us to measure the igm opacity as close to the host redshift as 1200    without interference from the blue wing of ly@xmath2(cf .",

    "the red boxes in figure  [ lyafig ] mark our measurements .",
    "the formal error bars are far smaller than the plotted symbols .",
    "the strong fluctuations in our measurements above and below the mean of the quasars are due to real cosmic variance caused by large - scale structure in the ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "we convert our transmission measurements into an effective optical depth following the definition of @xcite that @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the average transmission relative to the continuum .",
    "this is only an effective rather than true optical depth because transmission in a clumpy igm with variable density and ionization is dominated by low - density regions @xcite .",
    "we compute this @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) in bins of size @xmath10=0.15 relative to ly@xmath2  to facilitate direct comparison with the compilation of results from high - redshift quasars of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compute the same statistic for ly@xmath15  and ly@xmath14  in one and two bins , respectively .",
    "we use the same statistical correction as @xcite for foreground ly@xmath2  absorption and the same conversion factors to determine @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) from @xmath12(ly@xmath14 ) and @xmath12(ly@xmath15 ) , so our results are calculated as consistently as possible with the quasar data .",
    "we show the points from grb  130606a  in figure  [ taufig ] and report the numbers in table  [ transtab ] .",
    "the data points from the grb  130606a  line of sight are generally consistent with the evolution of @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) seen along the quasar sight lines and fall within the observed range of variation , although our highest redshift bin has an optical depth on the high side relative to the quasar measurements .",
    "our single ly@xmath15  point , covering @xmath0=5.70@xmath45.85 , is the first using that tracer at @xmath81 and implies a substantially higher @xmath12(ly@xmath2)=12.5 than that measured from ly@xmath2  or ly@xmath14 .",
    "this was also seen by @xcite at @xmath16 in a very limited number of sightlines .",
    "ly@xmath15  measurements in the quasars are made difficult by the necessity of avoiding ly@xmath82 at the blue end of the spectral window and the quasar s proximity zone at the red end .",
    "the interpretation of differences in @xmath12  determined from multiple proxies is complicated because the differing strengths of the transitions makes them differently sensitive to inhomogeneity in the igm and requires comparison to numerical simulations .",
    "recent work has focused on the statistics of dark pixels in the ly@xmath2  forest as a probe of the neutral fraction in the high - redshift universe to avoid dependence on models @xcite .",
    "@xcite emphasized that the quasar data at @xmath83 show an acceleration in the evolution of the effective optical depth with redshift relative to a power law extrapolation from data at lower redshifts @xcite , and that the scatter increases with redshift , possibly indicating that the tail end of reionization was a patchy process .",
    "the interpretation that there is an observed change in slope of @xmath12  associated with late reionization has been challenged by other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the large redshift bins we use to compare to the results of @xcite and @xcite then average over many such pixels ( @xmath10=0.15 is @xmath18132 pixels ) .",
    "another check on our errors is to compare our two independent spectra from different instruments .",
    "results from both mmt and gmos are given in table  [ transtab ] and are mostly similar , except for the darkest part of the ly@xmath2  absorption between redshifts 5.7 and 5.8 , where the mmt data show more transmission .",
    "this is caused by the extra bit of flux visible near 8150    in figure  [ specfig ] .",
    "this effect was caused by inadequate flat fielding and removal of the slit function in the mmt data leading to uneven background levels along the slit .",
    "it results in a slight excess of flux per pixel after background subtraction that is only visible near zero flux levels when the data are binned up .",
    "the exact amount of this positive flux was found to vary depending the exact background apertures chosen .",
    "we trust the gmos data much more due to their significantly higher s / n and our ability to check with the nod - and - shuffle reduction , which has much better control over the flat - fielding and sky subtraction uncertainties at flux levels near zero .",
    "our results are presented as transmission fractions , so we also need to examine our assumptions about the proper level of the unabsorbed continuum .",
    "we have been using our best - fit power law so far in this analysis . in section 2",
    ", we noted that the continuum did appear to be curved relative to a single power law .",
    "multiband photometry extending to the nir reported by the ratir and grond collaborations @xcite implies a bluer power law than the flatter continuum we have fit to our data over a more limited wavelength range .",
    "these observations can easily be reconciled by a small amount of dust producing curvature in the spectral energy distribution given that our observations are at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath851450   .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that our results are robust for any reasonable value for the true shape of the continuum .",
    "we show two extreme hypothetical alternative continuum shapes in figure  [ specfig ] as dashed lines .",
    "all assumed continuum shapes have to be constrained to pass near the actual observed continuum near 8650   .",
    "in addition , there is a peak in the igm transmission near 7150    that the true unabsorbed continuum must pass above , which sets a limit on how red the continuum can be .",
    "this power - law slope is shown by the lower dashed line on the figure . as a maximally blue model ,",
    "we take a power law with a slope as different from the best fit model as the maximally red one , but in the opposite direction from the best fit , and also constrain it to match the data near 8650   .",
    "we normalize the gmos data by both of these extreme models and computed the transmission fraction in the same redshift bins as above .",
    "we list the results with these alternative continuum normalizations ( called `` low '' and `` high '' ) for two redshift bins in table  [ transtab ] . even in our bluest bins , at @xmath86 , the difference in @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) is only @xmath180.1 . at higher",
    "redshift , closer in wavelength to where the continua are normalized , the effect is even smaller . in part , this is because @xmath12  depends only logarithmically on the continuum normalization .",
    "we emphasize that these alternative normalizations are far larger than anything motivated by the data and yet they do not materially affect the results .",
    "the maximal effects on the grb  130606a  data points in figures  [ lyafig ] and [ taufig ] induced by these choices of continuum slope are smaller than the points on the plots .",
    "we conclude that the uncertainties in our optical depth measurements are negligible compared to the dominant systematics in interpretation caused by theoretical uncertainties and cosmic variance along different lines of sight .",
    "in particular , these measurements would benefit from an improved theoretical understanding of the differences between @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) measured from the different lyman series lines .",
    "we examine our spectra for continuous regions of extremely high opacity and find that there is no detectable ly@xmath2  transmission in the redshift range of @xmath0=5.71@xmath45.83 , with a 3@xmath11 upper limit of @xmath870.2% , or @xmath12(ly@xmath2)@xmath136.4 .",

    "however , there are clear spikes of ly@xmath14  transmission at the ends of this redshift interval , including the interesting peak near @xmath0=5.803 noted previously to be almost coincident in redshift with a foreground absorber , so we also define a narrower redshift range of @xmath0=5.725@xmath45.79 to isolate the darkest part of the trough .",
    "this more restricted interval is the one marked with a black bar on figure  [ transfig ] .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) measurements for these two interval definitions are tabulated in table  [ transtab ] .    despite the lack of detectable ly@xmath2 , some flux is present in the ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath15  windows , indicating that the redshift interval is far from opaque and still highly ionized .",
    "the transmission of ly@xmath15  over the core redshift range implies that @xmath12(ly@xmath2 ) is @xmath1817 .",
    "the afterglow spectra of grbs can also be used to probe the neutral fraction of the igm @xcite .",
    "if a high - redshift grb occurs when the universe still contains a substantial fraction of neutral hydrogen , the red damping wing of this material will affect the shape of the cutoff in flux at ly@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite have searched for such an effect in the spectrum of the @xmath0=6.295 grb 050904 and found a best fit consistent with zero neutral hydrogen , although their analysis was hampered by the strong dla of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite have also performed an analysis on the @xmath0=6.733 grb 080913 and again found a null result .",
    "the much lower @xmath44  we determine here than for grb 050904 and the higher s / n of our data relative to the spectrum of grb 080913 allow us a cleaner test , although the neutral fraction is not expected to be sufficiently high to be detectable at this lower redshift given the limits on ly@xmath2  opacity discussed above .",
    "we use the approximations of @xcite to model the igm neutral density as a constant over the redshift range of interest",
    ". a pure igm fit to the ly@xmath2  cutoff in the gmos spectrum is a significantly worse fit than the single absorber model from section 3 .",
    "in addition , minima in the ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath15  absorption spectra at the host redshift ( figure  [ transfig ] ) demonstrate the need for at least some absorption from the host galaxy .",
    "a combined fit with a host galaxy absorber ( fixed to the redshift of the metal lines ) along with the igm model can fit the data as long as the igm neutral fraction ( @xmath88 ) is below @xmath89 , but is not required by the data .",
    "we conclude that our spectra are consistent with zero neutral fraction and @xmath90 at the 2@xmath11 level ( figure  [ nhfig ] ) .",
    "however , allowing more realistic models than a simple constant neutral density in the igm makes the interpretation of ly@xmath2  damping wings more problematic and significantly relaxes these constraints @xcite .",
    "we note that although most grb host galaxies are dlas @xcite , two out of the three highest redshift events with good measurements of the host hydrogen columns have @xmath44@xmath91 ( grbs 130606a and 080913 ) , which may bode well for the detectability of the red damping wing effect in the future at higher redshift .",
    "an evolution in the @xmath44  values observed in grb afterglow spectra would also have important implications for reionization . @xcite",
    "have used the distribution of @xmath44  values observed in grb afterglow spectra as a proxy to measure the escape fraction of uv ionizing photons from star - forming galaxies .",
    "if the grb host galaxy @xmath44  distribution really is lower at higher redshift , then the higher escape fractions would imply that star - forming galaxies can more efficiently reionize the universe .",
    "data from more lines of sight at these high redshifts are necessary to test this hypothesis .",
    "we have presented high s / n spectra of the optical afterglow of grb  130606a  at @xmath0=5.9134 , the first high - redshift afterglow to have a dataset of similar quality for igm studies to those published for individual high-@xmath0 quasars , although our spectral resolution was not as high as in the best quasar datasets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for comparison",
    ", we estimate that the continuum magnitude at the time of the gmos observations was @xmath1819.6 mag @xcite , or @xmath92  mag ( ab ) .",
    "this is comparable to the most luminous quasars known at similar redshifts @xcite and we were able to obtain 1.3  hr of spectroscopy with the 6.5-m mmt and 2  hr with the 8-m gemini - n telescope .",
    "these observations represent the first dataset on the evolution of the igm opacity at these redshifts using a tracer other than quasars , which @xcite has argued are sufficiently biased tracers of large - scale structure that they will overestimate the degree of ionization of the igm .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that the general trend of the quasar observations is reproduced in our dataset , although an individual sightline is of limited utility for making firm conclusions because of cosmic variance .",
    "once we have obtained a sample of grb afterglow spectra at high redshift , it will be interesting to compare the statistics of ly@xmath2  absorption using both tracers .",
    "we also find an extended region of ly@xmath2  absorption from @xmath0=5.71 to 5.83 , similar to the lowest - redshift gunn - peterson troughs found in quasar absorption spectra , over which we place a 3@xmath11 upper limit of 0.2% on the ly@xmath2  transmitted fraction , although ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath15  are not completely absorbed .",
    "the pixel - scale statistics ( e.g. , @xcite ) of dark regions in ly@xmath2  absorption windows such as this in a larger sample of grb afterglows will offer a complementary view of reionization to the studies of quasars .",
