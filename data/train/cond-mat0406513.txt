    "the system exhibits curie - weiss paramagnetism with a significant van vleck term and the onset of weak magnetic ordering at t@xmath1 manifests itself as a spin density wave ( sdw ) that arrays antiferromagnetically perpendicular to the coo@xmath8 planes  @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in this system , in particularly for x@xmath180.5 , has generated many publications with some conflicting results .",

    "the @xmath5 materials were first synthesized in polycrystalline form by means of a solid state reaction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 mixed in a sodium to cobalt ratio of 0.75:1.00 .",
    "the powders underwent calcination and reaction procedures at 750@xmath21  c for 12 hours and 850@xmath21  c for 24 hours respectively , with intermediate grindings to ensure homogeneity .",
    "due to the high volatility of the sodium , a `` fast heat - up '' method was employed during the preparation of the powder .",
    "the powders were then isostatically pressed into rods for crystal growth .",
    "single crystals were grown by the floating - zone technique using a csi four mirror ir image furnace .",

    "x - ray diffraction of the polycrystalline powder as well as a ground sample of a small portion of the single crystal revealed that the materials were single phase ( down to a resolution level of 3% ) hexagonal structures ( space group p6@xmath24/mmc ) with lattice parameters _ a _ = 2.83 @xmath25 and _ c _ = 10.97 @xmath25 .",

    "all the measurements presented below are taken on samples from this crystal .    magnetic susceptibility ( m / h ) measurements were carried out using a quantum design mpms-5s superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer and an oxford instruments vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) ; ac susceptibility ( @xmath28 ) investigations were also carried out using a standard mutual inductance technique with an ac driving field of 1 oe and a frequency of 403 hz . heat capacity and transport data",
    "were collected with a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) in magnetic fields up to 70 koe .",
    "the heat capacity ( c ) measurements were carried out by a two - tau relaxation method using both a standard @xmath29he and a @xmath30he insert . a background signal ( platform and apiezon n grease )",

    "dc susceptibility ( @xmath33 ) was measured between temperatures of 1.8 k and 400 k ( see figure  [ dcsus ] ) .",
    "@xmath33 is anisotropic with the measured value for h//_ab _ typically @xmath34 times larger than for h//_c _ and a changeover in anisotropy at @xmath36 k. the data can be fitted to a curie - weiss term plus a constant @xmath35 of @xmath36 emu/ mol for h@xmath37 _ c _ and @xmath38 emu/ mol for h@xmath37_ab_. this constant comprises of a small ( @xmath3 @xmath39 emu/ mol ) diamagnetic contribution from the localized core electrons and a significant contribution from orbital paramagnetism analogous to van vleck paramagnetic susceptibility plus a pauli paramagnetic component arising from the s electrons .",
    "after subtraction of @xmath35 , the inverse susceptibilities ( inset of figure  [ dcsus ] ) are linear and , assuming an isotropic free electron value of the land g - factor , yield values for the co@xmath9 effective moment of 2.05@xmath40 and 2.56@xmath40 for h@xmath37c and h@xmath41c respectively .",
    "the anisotropy in the measured moments is enigmatic but has been reported by other authors  @xcite ; the same inequitable moments of 1.46@xmath42 and 2.27@xmath42 were also observed in one of our @xmath43 crystals .",

    "the anisotropic gradients are indicative of the anisotropic nature of the g - factor.,width=377 ]    in the best quality samples the data is non - hysteretic ; high temperature hysteresis observed by other authors  @xcite and also in our samples that have been shown to contain cobalt oxide impurities by powder x - ray diffraction , is therefore not considered to be intrinsic to @xmath5 but is attributed to magnetic impurities .    in low fields at t@xmath1=22 k , a shoulder in the magnetisation",

    "c_-axis ( figure  [ sdw ] panel a ) with no corresponding feature discernable in the _ ab _ plane ( figure  [ sdw ] panel b ) .",
    "the susceptibility data can be explained as the establishment of antiferromagnetic spin / charge density wave within the cobalt oxide layers whose moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along _",
    "c _ ; in contrast to other published data  @xcite there is no evidence for a canting of the moments into the _ ab _ plane .",
    "a similar behaviour has also been observed in the related layered cobaltate @xmath46 , where the spin density wave can only be distinguished in the _ c _ plane susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "the step in @xmath47 at t@xmath1 can be observed even in very low fields of 10 oe ; with an increase in applied magnetic field the step becomes more distinct . at the highest fields the transition is qualitatively different and more reminiscent of an antiferromagnetic cusp , accentuating the fact that the principal magnetic interaction in this system is antiferromagnetic in nature . because of the lack of any significant impurity levels in our samples , the upturn in @xmath47 at low t can not be attributed to magnetic impurities .",
    "the magnitude of the curie constant in the low temperature data corresponds to the contribution of all of the co@xmath9 spins in the sample ; we can therefore rule out the possibility of a curie tail arising from free spins at the ends of broken spin chains .",
    "although the upturn in suppressed at high fields , this can not be due to saturation of free moments as we have found that m(h ) does not saturate even in fields as high as 120 koe .",
    "the transition temperature is independent of applied field and does not display hysteretic behaviour indicating that this is a second order phase transition .    .",
    "panel a : the sdw transition is clearly visible in low fields as a step in @xmath33 and as a cusp in higher fields with the field oriented along _ c _ which corresponds to the afm spin ordering with the moments aligned along _",
    "c_. panel b : @xmath33 data collected over the same temperature range with the field oriented along the _ ab _ planes .",
    "no features that can be associated with the sdw are observed.,width=604 ]    low temperature ac susceptibility measurements were taken with the driving field oriented along the _ c_-axis and in the _ ab _ plane and are shown in figure  [ acsus ] .",
    "@xmath28 displays the same anisotropy and low temperature cross - over as @xmath33 .",
    "curiously , no magnetic features were visible at t@xmath1 .",
    "a peak at @xmath48 k is visible for fields applied along both _",
    "ab _ and _ c _ , which has previously been reported  @xcite and attributed to low temperature antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "this low temperature feature is reminiscent of the susceptibility cusps found in spin glasses .",
    "preliminary investigations of the frequency dependence show a decrease in the cusp temperature with decreasing frequency , which is consistent with the varying dynamic response expected from a glassy ground state .",
    "the origin of this state is likely to be a consequence of the incoherency of the sdw with the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "it is plausible that the density wave may become pinned to the underlying co lattice which would result in low temperature glassy behaviour .",
    "other materials in which a spin density wave state has been observed , for example the organic salt @xmath49  @xcite , also exhibit low temperature glassy states for this very reason .",
    "magnetisation data as a function of applied field were collected above and below t@xmath1 in order to further characterise the nature of the sdw and are shown in figure  [ mhloops ] .",
    "once again , @xmath50 ( panel a ) and the anisotropy in the highest measured fields is independent of temperature at @xmath31.4 , which is in line with the @xmath51 vs. t results . at the lowest temperatures the loops exhibit considerable curvature ( shown in panel b ) , which disappears above 15 k. at 2 k the value of the magnetisation at 70 koe corresponds to moments of only @xmath30.016 @xmath52/co and @xmath30.011 @xmath52/co along _ ab _ and _ c _ respectively . above 60 koe",
    "there is a slight increase in @xmath53 , although no spin - flop transition is observed up to fields as high as 120 koe  @xcite . at low fields the data has hysteretic behaviour , which disappears at a temperature of @xmath315 k ( inset of panel b ) .",
    "the remanent magnetisation at 2 k is extremely small corresponding to just 0.0001 @xmath52/co along _ c _ and an order of magnitude smaller along _ ab_. the disappearance of this low temperature ferromagnetic component has been noted by previous authors  @xcite , although it was reported to occur below t@xmath1 , whereas our data indicate a lower temperature transition .",
    "anomalies in magnetic susceptibility data below @xmath54 have also been observed by sakurai et al .",
    "@xcite and attributed to modifications to the magnetic ground state .",
    "again , our data are consistent with the appearance , immediately below @xmath54 , of a sdw with the magnetic moments aligned antiferromagnetically along _",
    "c _ , with the appearance of a weak ferromagnetic component below 15 k. the co - existence of a ferromagnetic ground state with a sdw state ( both with different ordering temperatures ) has previously been seen in the related material @xmath46  @xcite , as well as several other sdw wave systems e.g. @xmath55  @xcite . in these materials",
    "the small ferromagnetic component arises from magnetic anisotropy , modifications to the geometry of the fermi surfaces as function of temperature below @xmath54 , and from the structure which leads to differences between the inter- and intra - layer coupling .",
    "we have measured the heat capacity of @xmath56 single crystals from 400 mk to 380 k ( see figure  [ cdata ] ) . over",
    "the whole temperature range studied the data can not be fitted using a single debye expression .",
    "satisfactory agreement with the data can be obtained using a combined debye - einstein function giving @xmath57 of 410 k and @xmath58 of 820 k weighted in the ratio 4/5 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with a mixture of acoustic and optical modes expected from a combination of light and heavy elements .",
    "the high temperature data contains two distinct features , one at t@xmath59=307 k and a second much larger peak at t@xmath8=336 k. we estimate from x - ray and magnetisation data that the magnetic impurity levels of @xmath20 or coo in the sample are less than 3% .",
    "@xmath20 orders antiferromagnetically at 40 k  @xcite ; there are no features in the data at this temperature .",
    "coo is reported to be afm at t@xmath60=289 k  @xcite . in order to rule out effects from coo",
    "we have measured the heat capacity of a polycrystalline sample uniaxially pressed into the form of a thin ( 3 @xmath61 3 @xmath61 1.5 mm@xmath30 ) pellet  @xcite ; a clear feature is seen in the data at t@xmath60=289 k. it maybe that non stoichiometric coo is present in the sample or that coo is incorporated into the layered structure altering t@xmath60 and the thermodynamic response . while we can not unequivocally rule out impurities producing these features we conclude at this stage that the high temperature peaks seen in the @xmath62 curves are intrinsic to the sample .",
    "we attribute the transition at t@xmath8 to a real space ordering of the na within the system .",
    "this sodium ordering transition has been noted by previous authors  @xcite , in which the sodium is rearranged from random ordering on the @xmath63 to the higher symmetry @xmath64 site at sodium concentrations above x=0.75 .",
    "the entropy associated with this transition is @xmath31 j/ mol k. this compares to just 10% of the configurational entropy expected for sodium ordering over the two available sites in the correct ratios , which is calculated to be 1.2r .",
    "this may indicate that considerable na disorder persists below t@xmath8 .    between a limited temperature range of 22 k to 30 k",
    "the data can be explained by assuming that c comprises of two terms , an electronic term and a phonon component , which in the low temperature limit , can be characterised using the debye model giving c=@xmath4t+@xmath65t@xmath30",
    ". a linear fit to the data ( inset b of figure  [ cdata ] ) gives a @xmath4 of 35 mj/ mol k and @xmath66@xmath67=550 k. the value of @xmath57 we obtain is slightly higher than the values calculated using the high temperature data but is in line with previous estimates . using this value we find that above 40 k the experimental data deviates substantially from the debye theory .",
    "this is consistent with a smaller than expected value for the measured heat capacity at high temperature .",
    "we find [ c(380 k)/ ( 3.7@xmath613r)]@xmath68=0.7 while the expected ratio using the debye theory is 0.9 .",
    "there is a lambda like anomaly at 22 k ( inset a of figure  [ cdata ] ) indicating the onset of magnetic ordering .",
    "this feature has previously been associated with the development of a sdw within this material and our results are found to be consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the transition is rather broad extending over at least 7 k , whereas the minimum sample heat pulse used around the transition was 0.1 k. this feature occurs at the same temperature in both heating and cooling runs with no discernable hysteresis to within the experimental accuracy of the technique used , again indicating that this is a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the jump at t@xmath1 is 0.4 j/ mol k which corresponds to 25% of the signal at this temperature .",
    "using the standard bcs expression @xmath69c / t@xmath70=1.43@xmath4 gives @xmath4 = 12.7 mj/ mol k which is consistent with the values obtained from the low temperature heat capacity ( see below ) .",
    "this value is large compared to the value seen in the spin density wave compound @xmath71 , where the jump in the specific heat at the sdw transition ( t=12.1 k ) amounts to only @xmath72 of the total heat capacity ,  @xcite but is smaller than the @xmath73 increase seen in @xmath74 at 17.5 k  @xcite .",
    "below t@xmath1 there is a considerable reduction in @xmath4 .",
    "an extrapolation of the low temperature data produces a value of 15 mj/ mol k. these values agree well bayrakci et al .",
    "@xcite who calculated @xmath4 for an x=0.82 sample from data below 22 k. it is interesting that the @xmath4 value below the sdw transition also agrees with estimates for @xmath4 made for the superconducting material @xmath75  @xcite . assuming the @xmath4 term arises solely from charge carriers we can use @xmath4=(@xmath76@xmath77n(e@xmath78 ) to calculate the free electron density of states .",
    "n(e@xmath78 ) is calculated to be 5.96@xmath6110@xmath794 ev/ mol just above t@xmath1 reducing to 2.55@xmath6110@xmath80 ev/ mol at 2 k. the ratio of @xmath4 above and below the transition suggests that @xmath81 of the fermi surface is removed by the opening up of a gap at t@xmath1 .",
    "the entropy associated with this feature can be obtained by subtracting from the total specific heat , c , an estimate of the background specific heat , c , made up of a contribution from the ungapped electrons plus the phonon contribution which we assume remains unchanged between base and 30 k ( see figure  [ cdata ] ) .",
    "the entropy associated with the anomaly alone ( i.e. from t=14 to 25 k ) amounts to 0.085 j/ mol k and corresponds to only 5% ( @xmath82rln(@xmath83)=1.73 j/ mol k ) of the entropy expected for a @xmath27 sample with a co@xmath7 ( spin 0 ) / co@xmath9 ( spin @xmath84 ) system in the ratio of 3:1 . including the excess entropy down to 2 k this value rises to 0.16 j/ mol k. the value compares well with estimates made in other reports  @xcite and is consistent with previous reports for sdw compounds . in the case of cr  @xcite",
    ", the entropy at the sdw transition ( 0.0184 j/ mol k ) corresponds to only @xmath85 of the entropy associated with long range antiferromagnetic order , but is equivalent to @xmath86 of the total electronic entropy , while in the case of @xmath71 , the entropy associated with the heat capacity anomaly amounts to @xmath87 of the total electronic entropy  @xcite . in our case a low temperature @xmath4 of 15 mj/ mol k suggests that the total sommerfeld electronic entropy at t=22 k should be 0.33 j/ mol k. the entropy associated with the transition is approximately @xmath88 of this value .",
    "we can model @xmath89c = c - c using @xmath89c=@xmath90 between 15 and 22 k and obtain an estimate for @xmath69=163 k ( 11.2 mev ) = 7.4t@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this value is much larger than the weak coupling bcs value and indicates that a strong electron - phonon coupling is involved in the sdw transition .",
    "similar values have been seen in the case of @xmath74  @xcite and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the value of @xmath69 obtained here with estimates made using other techniques , for example , inelastic neutron diffraction .",
    "there also exists an additional contribution to the heat capacity at 7k , which is clearly visible in the c / t vs. t@xmath79 plot as a broad ( extending from 4 - 15 k ) bump ( inset b of figure  [ cdata ] ) .",
    "the low temperature nodule is consistent with the notion of a glassy state , which was acknowledged in section @xmath94 .",
    "the broad peak is a result of the pinning of sdw domains to over an extended temperature range and has been observed for previously studied spin density wave systems  @xcite .    below 4",
    "k the c versus t dependence can once again be described by @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast to the work of both brhwiler et al .",
    "@xcite who studied an x=0.7 sample and ando et al .",
    "@xcite who have reported on heat capacity data for @xmath96 we observe no upturn in c / t at low temperature .",
    "it is not clear if the upturn in c / t has the same origin for the two cases that are reported .",
    "it is apparent that the sdw transition is absent in the material studied in reference  @xcite , while the c versus t data around 22 k is not shown in reference  @xcite",
    ". it would be instructive to study a range of na doping levels in order to determine if the more highly correlated electron behaviour reported in x=0.5 is suppressed as x is increased .",
    "the values of the resistivity at room temperature in both the _ c _ ( figure  [ tdata ] panel a ) and _ ab _ ( figure  [ tdata ] panel b ) directions are of the order 1 - 10 m@xmath97 cm .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with several other reports of resistivity measurements made on either polycrystalline or single crystals samples of @xmath98 in the _ ab _",
    "plane  @xcite . at room temperature",
    "the resistivity is only slightly anisotropic with @xmath99 @xmath100 3@xmath101 and a crossover in anisotropy at @xmath360 k ( figure  [ tdata ] inset ii ) .",
    "the resistance ratios ( r350k / r2k ) along _ ab _ and _ c _ are 30 and 200 respectively ; at 2 k @xmath101 and @xmath99 take values of 80 and 45 @xmath102 cm respectively . the data for @xmath56 reported here contrast sharply with previous publications for the x=0.5 composition which report an anisotropy ratio @xmath99 / @xmath101 as high as 200 at 4.2 k and a maximum in @xmath99 at @xmath100180 k resulting from a crossover from insulating two dimensional to metallic three dimensional behaviour  @xcite .",
    "we find that in both directions the resistivity between 280 k and 100 k varies almost linearly with temperature with d@xmath31/dt=6.4 @xmath102 cm/ k and 30.0 @xmath102 cm/ k for the _ ab _ and _ c _ directions respectively . a significant reduction in @xmath101 below 40 k ( with a maximum in d@xmath101/dt at 10 k ) marks the sdw transition .",
    "no corresponding feature is seen in @xmath99 .",
    "the reduction in @xmath31 suggests that the opening up of a gap associated with the sdw leads to a decrease in the total scattering within the ab plane while the conduction along _ c _ is unaffected .",
    "this downward feature is observed in several of the @xmath31 versus t curves for @xmath5 ( @xmath103 ) reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it is missing in other reports  @xcite , although notably the spin density wave transition is also absent in the susceptibility data .",
    "two previous groups  @xcite have reported an increase in @xmath31 at t@xmath1 at low temperatures albeit on higher sodium doped samples ( x = 0.82 and 0.9 respectively ) . however , in the most recent report  @xcite for a range of x between 0.7 and 0.78 , which includes the composition studied here , no upturn is observed .    at high temperature for @xmath101",
    "there are two weakly hysteretic transitions at 290 k and 320 k. for @xmath99 there is a single feature at 309 k ( figure  [ tdata ] inset i ) .",
    "there is also a @xmath320% decrease in d@xmath31/dt at higher temperatures ( e.g. the value of d@xmath101/dt decreases from 6.42 @xmath102 cm/ k to 7.1 @xmath102 cm/ k above 315 k ) .",
    "we associate these higher t features with an order - disorder transition of the na ions ( see heat capacity ) .",
    "refinement of the structure has suggested that at high temperature na ions are able to migrate through the structure in the planes between the two oxygen sheets  @xcite .",
    "ionic conduction is thus expected via the direct movement of the sodium ions .",
    "the sodium atom can occupy two positions in the lattice and a freezing of the na ions onto well defined sites could lead to a small increase in @xmath31 .",
    "ionic conductivities , however , at room temperature are expected to be much lower ( 10@xmath104 s/ cm ) than the magnitude of the jump in @xmath31 seen around room temperature ( @xmath105= 0.1 m@xmath97 cm ) .",

    "this leads to an insulating state at low t. at x=0.71 the effects are expected to be weaker",
    ". nevertheless , the carriers are still likely to be influenced by modulations in the na layers as the sodium ions order leading to charge localisation .",
    "these effects are much more strongly felt within the @xmath108 layers resulting in the sharp increase in @xmath31 .",

    "the magnetoresistance obeys kohler s rule ( with no indication of saturation up the maximum measured field of 70 koe ) and is removed by raising the temperature above @xmath315 k. it is interesting to note that this correlates well with the temperature at which the spontaneous magnetisation present in the @xmath47(h ) data disappears .",
    "electronic structure calculations for @xmath96  @xcite give a resistivity anisotropy ( @xmath99 / @xmath101 ) of 8 .",
    "the higher values seen experimentally for x=0.5  @xcite are attributed to the effects of scattering due to na disorder , which it is claimed should make the @xmath111-axis transport less coherent .",
    "the increased na content in these samples appears to lead to a significant modification in the transport process producing a more three dimensional system . for @xmath5 the co -",
    "co distance remains almost constant at 2.83 @xmath25 for @xmath112 .",
    "we note that this co - co spacing is above the critical value quoted by molenda  @xcite for metallic conduction .",
    "the _ c_-axis decreases with increasing x. at x=0.5 a crossover from metallic behaviour at low temperature to thermally activated polaronic conduction at room temperature has been attributed to an increase in the _",
    "c_-axis distance with temperature  @xcite .",
    "this in turn leads to a transition from itinerant to a more localised @xmath13 band as the temperature increases . following the arguments of molenda we suggest that at x=0.7 the shorter out of plane co - o - o - co bond length ( here the room temperature value of _ c _ is 10.96 @xmath25 ) stabilises the itinerant electron phase along the c - axis while the extended @xmath13 @xmath113 @xmath14 band ensures good conductivity within the _ ab _ plane .",
    "in addition the presence of increased na content reduces the tendency for carrier localisation along _ c _ because of the preferential random ordering of the sodium on the 6h site as mentioned previously  @xcite .",
    "we have identified a number of features in our data that are expected to be common to high quality single crystal samples in the x@xmath30.7 region of the phase diagram .",
    "an antiferromagnetic sdw ground state exists below 22 k. the onset of the sdw has effects on the heat capacity and transport properties , causing a reduction in both @xmath4 and @xmath31 below t@xmath1 .",
    "it has been suggested for @xmath5 that the two sections of the fermi surface ( i.e. the narrow @xmath13 and the broader @xmath13 @xmath113 @xmath14 ) bands play different roles . the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath47 , and the electronic component of the heat capacity , @xmath4 , depend ( to lowest order ) on the density of states which is determined by the large fermi surface with @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the carriers in the @xmath13 @xmath113 @xmath14 band are mobile because the band is spread in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "the @xmath13 band is unstable to the formation of the sdw leading to modifications in @xmath47 and @xmath4 .",
    "the reduction in electron - electron scattering resulting from the formation of the sdw leads to an increase in conductivity along _ ab _ , despite the expected reduction in the number of charge carriers .",
    "the layered structure of the @xmath5 system is reflected in the magnetic susceptibility data where both the temperature independent susceptibility and land g - factor are anisotropic , a feature common to other cobalt based oxide materials .",
    "the transport properties are also anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropy appears to increase with decreasing x ( towards x = @xmath84 ) .",
    "other features also appear to depend sensitively on doping levels .",
    "for instance , the na ordering transition has been reported to occur at various different temperatures in the range 320 - 340 k. this may be a consequence of the fact that the relative occupancies of na(1 ) and na(2 ) are variable with x.    below 15 k the hysteresis observed in m(h ) loops indicates that the magnetic order has a small ferromagnetic component . a large , positive magnetoresistance coexists with this fm state .",
    "the magnitude of the observed hysteresis along with the nearly linear m(h ) behaviour and the peak in @xmath33(t ) seen at higher fields , underline the fact that whilst ferromagnetic correlations play a role in this system , the sdw is predominantly antiferromagnetic in nature . at the lowest temperatures both the heat capacity and the @xmath28 data suggest that a significant portion of the sdw state is pinned producing a glassy ground state .",
    "this is not uncommon amongst sdw materials .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support of the epsrc ( uk ) for this project .",
    "99                    the powder diffraction pattern was identified as @xmath19 by comparison to icdd powder diffraction file 19 - 1130 .",
    "no carbonate impurity existed in the crystal precusor material or in the furnace atmosphere and it is therefore assumed that sodium oxide is produced during crystal growth which then reacts with carbon dioxide once the furnace is opened .",
