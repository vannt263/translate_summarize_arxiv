    "we continue a study ( @xcite ; article  i ) on the 26 december 2001 event ( sol2001 - 12 - 26 ) .",
    "this solar eruptive - flare event produced a strong flux of solar energetic particles ( seps , mainly protons ) near earth and a 63rd ground - level enhancement of cosmic - ray intensity ( gle63 ) .",
    "gles represent the highest - energy extremity of seps ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "gles are rare events ; seventy - two gles only have been recorded since 1942 .",
    "the rare occurrence of gles hampers understanding their origins and finding consistent patterns that might govern their appearance and properties .    unlike electrons , whose signatures",
    "are manifold throughout the whole electromagnetic range , accelerated protons and heavier ions can only be detected on the sun from nuclear @xmath1-ray emission lines appearing in their interactions with dense material ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "solar @xmath1-ray observations have been very limited in the past .",
    "no @xmath1-ray images were available before 2002 . due to the observational limitations , considerations of the origins of seps and , especially",
    ", gles mainly refer to the hypotheses proposed several years ago ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a review ) . on the other hand , studies based on recent observations",
    "@xcite indicate that some of these hypotheses might need refinement .",
    "gles are typically produced by major eruptive events associated with big flares ( mostly of the goes x - class ) , fast coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and strong microwave bursts .",
    "the common association with different solar energetic phenomena @xcite hampers the identification of the origins of seps and gles .",
    "all of these circumstances show how important the analysis of a solar source of each gle is .    with a general correspondence between the magnitudes of seps , cme speeds , and flare manifestations , there are few outliers from the correlations @xcite",
    ". strong fluxes of high - energy protons were observed near earth after these events associated with moderate microwave bursts .",
    "the correlation between the proton fluences , on the one hand , and microwave and soft x - ray ( sxr ) fluences , on the other hand , is considerably higher .",
    "this is difficult to understand , if seps are exceptionally shock - accelerated",
    ". a flare - related contribution could also be significant in the events , whose proton productivity was enhanced for some unclear reasons .",
    "one of these events was the sol2001 - 12 - 26 eruptive - flare event responsible for gle63 .",
    "this solar event has not been comprehensively studied because of its limited observations .",
    "we are not aware of either low - coronal observations of an eruption or hard x - ray ( hxr ) data . on the other hand ,",
    "the event was observed in microwaves by the _ siberian solar radio telescope _ ( ssrt : @xcite ) at 5.7ghz ; the _ nobeyama radioheliograph _ ( norh : @xcite ) at 17 and 34ghz , and in ultraviolet ( uv ) by the _ transition region and coronal explorer _",
    "( trace : @xcite ) .",
    "the ssrt observations have been studied in article  i. its conclusions are :    1 .",
    "most likely , gle63 was caused by the m7.1 solar event in active region ( ar ) 9742 ( n08w54 ) .",
    "contribution from a concurrent far - side event is unlikely .",
    "the flare was much longer than other gle - related flares and consisted of two parts .",
    "the first , possibly eruptive , flare and a moderate microwave burst started at 04:30 and reached an m1.6 level .",
    "the main flare , up to m7.1 , with a much stronger burst started at 05:04 , when a cme was launched .",
    "3 .   the main flare involved strong magnetic fields presumably associated with a sunspot in the west part of ar  9742 .",
    "two non - thermal sources observed at 5.7ghz initially approached each other nearly along the magnetic neutral line , and then moved away from it like expanding ribbons , as if they were associated with the legs of the flare arcade .",
    "it was difficult to confirm and expand these indications in article  i based solely on the ssrt data because of their insufficient spatial resolution and coalignment accuracy . to verify and elaborate these results , observations of the flare arcade or ribbons in a different spectral range , where they are clearly visible ,",
    "should be compared with microwave data of a higher spatial resolution .    of special interest",
    "is a conjectured localization of the non - thermal microwave sources in the legs of the flare arcade .",
    "this possibility does not contradict a commonly accepted view on the flare process ; however , hxr and microwaves almost always show a few simple non - thermal sources .",
    "ribbon - like hxr structures have been observed in exceptional events @xcite .",
    "the simplicity and confinement of non - thermal sources in impulsive flares suggested involvement of one to two loops @xcite .",
    "later observational studies extended this view up to some long - duration flares @xcite .",
    "a concept of a single microwave - emitting loop became dominant .",
    "one of the major purposes of our companion articles is to find the possible causes of the contrast between the rich proton outcome of this solar event and its moderate manifestations in microwaves .",
    "we consider _ a priori _ the contributions from the acceleration processes both in the flare and by the shock wave to be possible @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we examine the 26 december 2001 flare in this article ( article  ii ) and eruptive event in article  iii ( grechnev _ et al . _ , 2017 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we endeavor to shed further light on the listed issues related to the flare itself and its microwave emission , analyzing the observations carried out by trace in 1600  and by norh at 17 and 34ghz .",
    "trace observed the flare mostly in the 1600  channel , which we use .",
    "the 1600  images are similar to those observed in the h@xmath2 line , but they do not show filaments .",
    "some images were produced less often in other uv channels , 1550 and 1700 , and in white light .",

    "the imaging interval between 63 images from 04:23 to 04:55 was around 30 seconds , and then it decreased to about 2 seconds from 05:04 to 05:22 .",
    "the exposure time was 0.43 seconds before 04:30 , then 0.26 seconds until 05:00 , and it changed cyclically between 0.020 , 0.031 , and 0.052 seconds during the main flare .",
    "a movie in the electronic supplementary material presents the whole flare observed in 1600 .",
    "we processed the trace images as follows : the background level was found for each image as a highest - probability value in its histogram .",
    "this individual level was subtracted from each image , which was converted to a reference exposure time of 0.43 seconds .",
    "the offset between the 1600  and white - light channels was corrected from their coalignment .",
    "comparison with white - light images produced by the _ michelson doppler imager _ ( mdi : @xcite ) onboard soho revealed a roll angle of @xmath3 in the trace images , which was compensated , and refined their absolute pointing coordinates .",
    "all of the images were transformed to 05:04 to compensate for the solar rotation .",

    "the first , geometrical cause is the location of the uv ribbon centroid near a bend of the neutral line ( figures [ f - flare_regions ] and [ f - trace_mag_wl ] ) that distorts the measured shear angle .",

    "the agreement between the trajectories observed in 1600  and at 17ghz can not be a coalignment issue , because the west microwave source was localized from 04:47 to 05:22 within @xmath22 , while the east microwave source displaced systematically during this interval by @xmath23 ( excluding the later mismatching part of its trajectory ) .",

    "the real physical distinction between the structures emitting in these two spectral ranges and responsible processes might be emphasized by different instrumental characteristics of trace and norh .",

    "its absence in microwaves is not surprising , especially with a limited dynamic range of norh of about 300 .    the images in figures [ f - trace_conv]k and [ f - trace_conv]l become less similar due to the upper part of the coronal arcade appearing at 17ghz , but invisible in the uv .",
    "the brightness temperature of the arcade in figure  [ f - trace_conv]l exceeded 15  mk estimated for this time from goes data in article  i ; the power - law index of its brightness temperature spectrum estimated from the images at 17 and 34ghz was around @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , thermal bremsstrahlung could only supply a minor contribution .",
    "most likely , the upper part of the arcade was dominated by trapped electrons with a harder spectrum , consistent with a general pattern established by @xcite , and in later studies .    in summary ,",
    "the microwave sources a and b were , most likely , associated with the legs of the arcade rooted in the ribbons .",
    "bright kernels in 1600  represented instantaneous loci of the electron precipitation .",
    "electrons trapped in numerous loops , whose footpoints were shown by the uv kernels previously , emitted a prolonged background gs emission .",
    "this long - lasting background reinforced the similarity between the images of the long - lived flare ribbons and microwave sources .",
    "this possible scenario should be manifested in the evolution of the microwave spectrum .",
    "in addition to the detailed gs spectra presented in figure  [ f - norp_lear]e for four instances , here we examine the overall variations of the peak frequency [ @xmath30 and a power - law index of microwave - emitting electrons [ @xmath10 for the whole flare .",
    "the @xmath31 index of the electron - number spectrum can be calculated as @xmath32 @xcite ; @xmath2 should be estimated from optically thin data , _",
    "e.g. _ , from the total flux norp data at 17 and 35ghz or from norh images at 17 and 34ghz .",
    "we used both methods , because norp data are characterized by a higher accuracy , while norh data provide a higher sensitivity .",
    "the contribution of thermal bremsstrahlung was subtracted .",
    "the result was smoothed over ten seconds .     with corresponding styles.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the peak frequency",
    "was estimated in a way similar to the technique used by @xcite and @xcite from norp and learmonth total flux data ( section  [ s - microwave_observations ] ) .",
    "for each instance , a combined spectrum at 12 frequencies was averaged over 16 seconds , and a parabola was fitted to the five points of the log  log spectrum closest to the peak .",
    "the result was smoothed over 30 seconds .",
    "figure  [ f - delta ] shows the 17 and 35ghz fluxes along with an estimated thermal flux , and the calculated @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "the intervals with doubtful estimates are rejected .",
    "the values of @xmath31 estimated from norh data are more reliable than those from norp data for weaker fluxes and conversely for stronger fluxes .    the electron index [ @xmath10 in figure  [ f - delta]b has an impulsive component superposed on a harder gradual background . the initial values of @xmath34 are too hard , probably due to underestimation of the thermal flux from the goes data .",
    "they are insensitive to plasma temperatures of @xmath35  mk , whose contribution to microwaves can be considerable .",
    "its possible role should lessen , as the gs emission increased .",
    "the gs emission from trapped electrons with a progressively hardened spectrum in the course of a continuous injection probably dominated late in the event .",
    "the trapping effect could also affect the initial part of figure  [ f - delta]b , because the flare lasted about 20 minutes before 04:50 .",
    "comparison of figures [ f - delta]a and [ f - delta]b shows that the impulsive component corresponds to enhancements in the time - profiles .",
    "most likely , freshly injected electrons had a softer spectrum with @xmath36 , which did not change considerably throughout the flare .",
    "a probable power - law index of microwave - emitting electrons was mostly @xmath37 .",
    "the peak frequency in figure  [ f - delta]c varies in a range of 57ghz .",
    "the values of @xmath33 ( and @xmath31 in figure  [ f - delta]b ) at the four marked instances are close to those estimated in figure  [ f - norp_lear]e in a slightly different way .",
    "the evolution of @xmath33 suggests interplay of parameters of emitting electrons and magnetic - field strength ; however , the range of @xmath33 seems to be atypically narrow and low for the observed microwave fluxes . a possible key to these challenges",
    "could be a distributed microwave - emitting system .",
    "the average @xmath33 of individual sources was around 6ghz , and their total number elevated the peak flux of each one up to the observed values .",
    "the scatter between the parameters of the sources could be a reason for the broadening of the microwave spectrum and its gradual shape .",
    "analysis of the microwave and uv images has shown that each of the two microwave sources observed at 5.7 , 17 , and 34ghz was associated with one of the two ribbons located in opposite - polarity magnetic fields .",
    "the appearance of each microwave source corresponds to the whole related ribbon , as if it had been viewed by norh .",
    "both the ribbons and microwave sources exhibited nearly identical systematic motions .",
    "until the peak of the microwave burst , the two flare centers approached each other nearly along the neutral line , so that the distance and shear between them considerably decreased .",
    "after that , the motion occurred away from the neutral line , corresponding to the usual expansion of the ribbons .",
    "the expansion was measured from the ssrt data until 06:30 in article  i.    the correspondence of each microwave source to the flare ribbon , their nearly identical motions , and surprisingly persistent shape of the microwave spectrum , in spite of 18-fold flux variations , indicate that microwaves were emitted by the conjugate legs of multiple loops constituting the flare arcade .",
    "the relation of the magnetic - field strengths under the ribbons points to a strongly asymmetric configuration .",
    "magnetic - flux conservation in flare loops requires larger areas of the sources above the weaker - field east ribbon relative to their conjugate counterparts above the sunspot - associated west ribbon . to verify these considerations , we will attempt to reproduce the observed spectra by means of a simple model , using the magnetic fields actually measured .      the microwave flux density [ @xmath38 at optically thin frequencies [ @xmath39 is controlled by the instantaneous total number of emitting high - energy electrons [ @xmath40 .",

    "a multitude of kernels constitutes an instant uv - emitting stripe corresponding to a narrow moving flare ribbon in the standard model .",
    "then , @xmath58 , which is magnetic flux within the ribbon stripe at time [ @xmath59 . presumably , @xmath57 is proportional to the lifetime of accelerated electrons in the magnetic tube , and @xmath60 is proportional to the magnetic flux across a gs source at time [ @xmath59 .",
    "a particular value of @xmath57 is not important , if it is much shorter than the burst .    if the flare process operated self - similarly throughout the burst , then the ratio of energy released in the current sheet during @xmath57 , @xmath61 , to the total energy of electrons produced at the same time , @xmath62 , was constant , _",

    "@xcite found the peak - frequency variations to be small in about one third of the events .",
    "the authors related this behavior to gs self - absorption around the peak of the burst and to the tsytovich ",
    "razin suppression in its early rise and late decay .",
    "@xcite reported the latter effect indeed ; however , its importance at the rise of a long - duration flare is difficult to reconcile with chromospheric evaporation .",
    "it is quantified by the neupert effect @xcite , _",

    "the plasma density is initially low , reducing the tsytovich ",
    "razin effect at this stage . at the decay of our burst , _",

    "thus , the ideas of @xcite are unlikely to help us , because the magnetic fields of @xmath89 g they considered are too weak for our sunspot - associated flare .    to account for the low - frequency increase in a gs spectrum , inhomogeneity of the source and superposition of multiple sources",

    "we are interested in general features of this system and need a very simple analytic description of gs emission , which the @xcite approximations present .",
    "their reduced accuracy at the lowest and highest harmonics of the gyrofrequency is not crucial for the task of the model to understand properties of our event .",
    "our model contains a considerable number of homogeneous gs sources , each with a different magnetic - field strength and volume .",
    "their number depends on the width and length of the brightest parts of the uv ribbons .",
    "the model should also demonstrate the direct dependence of the total flux and spectrum of the microwave emission on the total magnetic flux and its distribution over each of the ribbons .",

    "if the loops do not overlap , then their total flux [ @xmath38 is the sum of the fluxes emitted by all of the loops .",
    "each @xmath93th loop is represented by two homogeneous cubic sources in its legs above both ribbons , corresponding to the observations at 5.7 and 17ghz .",
    "magnetic fluxes in conjugate cubes are equal to each other , @xmath94 .",

    "two methods of partition are possible .    in the first method ,",

    "each @xmath93th pair corresponds to a loop .",
    "the loops do not overlap , and the procedure to find @xmath102 and @xmath103 seems to be physically justified .",

    ", we refer to @xcite , who found an average magnetic field of @xmath127 g using a homogeneous gs source model and a scaling law between @xmath128 and the total area of a source .",
    "an intuitive option to calculate @xmath125 as a ratio of 400 g to an average field strength measured from the magnetogram within the ribbons leads to a biased estimate because of a nonlinear dependence of the microwave flux on magnetic field .    with any number of the sources , the flux at optically thin frequencies [ @xmath129 is controlled by the total number of emitting electrons and their emissivity .",
    "thus , @xmath130 with @xmath131 ; @xmath132 is the viewing angle @xcite . the constancy of the optically thin total flux emitted by the same electron population with any number of the sources , up to a single large one ( subscript `` s '' ) , results in an equality @xmath133 . using the constancy of the total number of emitting electrons , @xmath134",

    "figure  [ f - model_spectrum]a presents the results of the modeling by the gray line for the first flare ( episode  1 ) and the black line for the rise of the main flare ( episode  2 ) .",
    "these two episodes were soon after fresh injections , when emission of trapped electrons , which we do not consider , can be neglected , and an assumption of a constant @xmath141 is justified .",
    "the symbols denote the observed fluxes .",
    "an enhancement at 2ghz was due to a contribution from plasma emission .",
    "the average magnetic flux over the ribbon stripe [ @xmath142 used in the modeling is specified for each episode . the average field strength above the west ribbon stripe [ @xmath143 additionally affects the microwave flux at optically thin frequencies .",

    "in section  [ s - reconnection_power ] we obtained @xmath148 assuming the magnetic field to be uniform at both sides of the neutral line that is not realistic .",
    "nevertheless , the model takes account of a real inhomogeneity of the photospheric magnetic field and acceptably matches the real spectrum .",
    "the relation between the magnetic flux and microwaves can be generalized to a variable magnetic field , considering the intrinsic dependence of the microwave flux on the magnetic field strength , @xmath149 .",
    "the ratio of the optically thin microwave fluxes in the two episodes in figure  [ f - model_spectrum]a is 8.9 , while the ratio of the magnetic fluxes within the ribbon stripes is 4.4 . with @xmath150 ,",
    "the expected microwave flux ratio is @xmath151 , which agrees with the model result of 8.9 within @xmath152 .",
    "this seems to be acceptable with our simplified approach .    figure  [ f - model_spectrum]b demonstrates the influence on the spectrum of the number of loops for episode  1 .",
    "the increase of the number of loops elevates the low - frequency branch of the spectrum .",
    "the effect is similar to that of the source inhomogeneity .",
    "the ratio of the 16-loop spectrum to the single - loop one at 2ghz is 5.1 in this case .",

    "the strongest effect of asymmetry at optically thin frequencies is illustrated by two extremities .",
    "the high - frequency flux from a highly asymmetric configuration is determined by a single source , and the flux is doubled in a symmetric configuration ( two identical sources ) .",
    "the effect of asymmetry varies between a factor of one and two .",
    "the same occurs for the opposite asymmetry .",
    "thus , with the same magnetic - flux reconnection rate , the high - frequency flux can vary within a factor of four .",
    "the actual ratios of the optically thin fluxes in figure  [ f - model_spectrum]c are 1.26 between the dashed and solid lines and 1.40 between the solid and dotted lines .",
    "the asymmetry in this event progressively increased .",
    "the west ribbon expanded into the sunspot umbra , the east ribbon developed into weaker - field regions . to balance magnetic flux , an increasing high - frequency emission from the stronger - field west regions must be accompanied by an increasing area of the weaker - field east region that elevated the low - frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum shape remained nearly constant , in spite of large changes in the microwave flux .",
    "the relevance of a homogeneous source and simplified expressions by @xcite were discussed by @xcite .",
    "as they showed , the usage of a scaling law between the average magnetic field and total source area makes the homogeneous model sufficient to estimate statistical characteristics of microwave bursts such as the peak flux and frequency and spectral index . each elementary loop in our model",
    "is replaced by two homogeneous sources of different size and magnetic field .",
    "a set of 32 homogeneous sources reflects inhomogeneity of the ribbons . the scaling factor to shift from their magnetic fields to those in microwave sources",
    "is based on the results of @xcite .",
    "our model acceptably reproduces the spectra also around the peak and at lower frequencies .",
    "modeling of the circular polarization of the gs emission is complicated by the near - the - limb location of the flare site . since the west microwave source is visible through quasi - transversal magnetic fields associated with the arcade , polarization reversal",
    "is expected in a wide frequency range .",
    "thus , the polarization of each elementary source is a result of interplay between the optical thickness and polarization reversal issues , both frequency - dependent .",
    "this makes the analysis of the polarization of the west source and the total emission too complex .",
    "the polarized emission of the east source can only be extracted in norh 17ghz and ssrt 5.7ghz images .",
    "for the degree of polarization of each optically thin elementary source we used a corrected formula from @xcite , otherwise we assigned an opposite polarization of 15% .",
    "the results for episode  1 are ( all negative ; first observed , second model ) : @xmath153\\%$ ] at 5.7ghz , @xmath154\\%$ ] at 17ghz ; for episode  2 : @xmath155\\%$ ] at 5.7ghz , @xmath156\\%$ ] at 17ghz .",
    "the model reproduces the actual degree of polarization within a factor of two with a correct sign .",
    "the outcome of our simple modeling can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the observed properties of the gs spectrum are consistent with the emission from a distributed multi - loop system , _",
    "i.e. _ the flare arcade .",
    "the asymmetry of the magnetic configuration is important .",
    "the magnetic - flux balance requires larger areas at the weaker - field side that elevated the low - frequency part of the spectrum , shifting the peak frequency left .",
    "inhomogeneities of the individual sources could strengthen this effect .",
    "3 .   to reproduce the observed spectrum with realistic magnetic fields , a large increase of the magnetic flux is required in the main flare",
    "( the average field strength changed insignificantly ) .",
    "this result is consistent with a temporal correlation between the magnetic - flux change rate and hxr emission found by @xcite , who measured magnetic flux within expanding parts of the ribbons .",
    "replacement of a distributed multi - loop system by a single loop is generally not equivalent and can result in a different shape of the spectrum , peak frequency , and their behaviors during the burst .",
    "this leads to the next item .",
    "modeling of a microwave - emitting loop initiated by @xcite has been developed into a powerful tool @xcite .",
    "the models use real data on magnetic field and take account of its inhomogeneity , anisotropy and spatial distribution of electrons .",
    "a next - step challenge is a realistic multi - loop model , at least , for simplified conditions .",
    "elements of the scheme presented here might be helpful in its development .      as known from observations in the h@xmath2 line , flare kernels and ribbons initially approach each other along the neutral line , and then they move away from it .",
    "the expansion of the ribbons was explained by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) standard flare model .",
    "the motions along the neutral line have not been clearly visualized .",
    "various motions observed later in hxr were summarized by @xcite .",
    "the authors interpreted them in terms of the 2d model ; their cartoons implied a questionable rotation of the current sheet around the vertical axis .",
    "the motions along the neutral line have reasonably been considered as an intrinsically 3d effect .",
    "its scheme was presented by @xcite .",
    "the authors supposed contraction of reconnected loops to be a necessary element of the unshearing process , whereas the two phenomena seem to be different results of the flare reconnection not directly related with each other .",
    "@xcite reported microwave observations of the motions along the neutral line .",
    "the authors noticed that an m2.6 flare developed along the arcade visible in the h@xmath2 and extreme - uv images and that , at least , several loops were involved in the process .",
    "however , they considered a single loop for each instance . in the discussion of the unshearing motions they mostly follow @xcite .",
    "the motions of the microwave sources in our event corresponded to those of the brightest parts of the ribbons , which we call the ribbon stripes for brevity .",
    "figure  [ f - scheme ] explains the relative displacement of the stripes .",
    "the intrinsic 3d geometry implies the presence in an extended current sheet of a zone of most efficient energy release , where the reconnection process is most similar to the 2d model .",
    "the formation of major stripes is associated with this zone .",
    "figures [ f - scheme]a and [ f - scheme]b present evolution of three magnetic loops , which reconnected in this zone .",
    "initially , these loops belonged to a certain layer of magnetic arcades above the pre - eruptive filament .",
    "the dotted line connects the bases of the central loop to show the shear .",
    "figure  [ f - scheme]c shows the central loops of different layers .",
    "the higher a loop , the smaller is the shear of its bases .",
    "the loops evolve similarly to the central loop in figures [ f - scheme]a and [ f - scheme]b .",
    "the major stripes corresponding to these loops displace as the arrows show , reflecting the decrease of the shear with the increasing height of the pre - eruptive arcade .",
    "the major motions initially occurred nearly along the neutral line and away from it during the main flare phase and afterwards . this behavior ( not shown in figure  [ f - scheme ] ) is associated with a non - uniform decrease of the shear away from the neutral line .",
    "a similar behavior is exhibited by helical lines of a cylindric nonlinear force - free magnetic field ( @xmath157 ) when @xmath158 with @xmath159 .",
    "non - thermal emissions are generated by energetic electrons and carry the most direct information about acceleration processes in flares . as noted in section  [ s - introduction ] , non - thermal sources observed in hxr and microwaves are usually simple and confined , which favors their identification with one or two flaring loops .",
    "this view drawn from microwave observations of almost all impulsive flares has been generalized to some major long - duration flares @xcite .",
    "still stronger confinement is typical of hxr sources ; complex structures like extended ribbons were observed in exceptional events @xcite .",
    "by contrast , observations of flares in thermal emissions ( h@xmath2 line , uv , extreme uv , sxr ) typically show complex multi - component structures of a larger extent . this dissimilarity has led to different views on flaring structures drawn from different observations .",
    "on the other hand , synergy between the structures observed in thermal and non - thermal emissions has been conjectured previously , including studies in which some of us participated @xcite .",
    "the causes of the differences between non - thermal sources and configurations visible in thermal emissions were unclear .    a key idea by @xcite explaining this difference has not been commonly perceived .",
    "the authors pointed out the limitations on the sensitivity and dynamic range ( typically @xmath160 ) in the hxr imaging .",
    "indeed , images in hxr and @xmath1-rays have been provided by the imagers of the fourier - synthesis type with an intrinsically limited coverage of the @xmath161-plane .",
    "these are the _ hard x - ray telescope _",
    "( hxt : @xcite ) onboard _ yohkoh _ and the _ reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( rhessi : @xcite ) .",
    "sources weaker than 10% of the brightest one are not detectable in their images @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that hxr sources accompanied the h@xmath2 kernels in strongest magnetic fields only ; `` the hxr sources indicate where large energy release has occurred , while the h@xmath2 kernels show the precipitation sites of nonthermal electrons with higher spatial resolution '' .",
    "flares have been imaged in microwaves also almost exclusively with fourier - synthesis interferometers ( mainly norh ) .",
    "they provide a better coverage of the @xmath161-plane than hxr imagers .",
    "on the other hand , optically thin gs emission strongly depends on the magnetic field @xmath162 with @xmath163 . with a dynamic range of norh of @xmath164 @xcite ,",
    "its opportunities to observe weaker non - thermal structures seem to be comparable to hxr imagers .",
    "also , microwave telescopes have a poorer spatial resolution than hxr imagers .    for these reasons , the strongest non - thermal sources are only expected in hxr and microwave images without weaker structures due to instrumental limitations .",
    "configurations , in which accelerated electrons are manifested , and those visible in thermal emissions , must actually be closely associated with each other .    both thermal and non - thermal emissions in our event originated in basically the same configuration .",
    "dissimilarities between the structures visible in microwaves and uv were mainly due to different spatial resolution and dynamic range of the instruments and different dependencies of the emissions on the magnetic field strength .",
    "@xcite also concluded that , at least , some of the single - loop configurations in norh images corresponded to multi - loop arcades observed with telescopes of a higher spatial resolution .    an appropriate proxy for a configuration responsible for non - thermal emissions may be a structure observed in extreme ultraviolet or in soft x - rays .",
    "this expectation corresponds to widely accepted model concepts of eruptive flares ( processes in confined flares are unlikely different in nature ",
    "see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . this should be thoroughly verified .",
    "if this is correct , then considerations of simple configurations are justified , when they appear so in thermal emissions .",
    "inevitable simplifications should be recognized to avoid inadequate conclusions .",
    "we have studied the 26 december 2001 eruptive flare , combining the trace 1600  and norh 17 and 34ghz images , the results obtained in article  i from the ssrt 5.7ghz images , and different data .",
    "the analysis has shown that the first flare and main flare were most likely associated with separate eruptions .",
    "the first eruption presumably occurred in ar  9742 around 04:40 and produced ejecta , which did not appear in the lasco field of view but manifested in a slowly drifting radio burst .",
    "a related moderate two - ribbon flare involved medium magnetic fields , produced a moderate microwave burst up to a few hundreds sfu at 56ghz , and reached a goes importance of m1.6 .",
    "this flare lasted half an hour and had not fully decayed when another eruption occurred in ar  9742 .",
    "the second eruption occurred around 05:04 and produced a fast cme .",
    "the flare passed into the major two - ribbon flare and reached a strength of m7.1 .",
    "the east ribbon observed in the first flare lengthened and broadened farther into regions of moderate and weak magnetic fields .",
    "the west ribbon entered the strongest magnetic fields above the sunspot umbra .",
    "the flare magnetic configuration was increasingly asymmetric .",
    "the microwave burst strengthened up to 4000sfu at 67ghz and 780sfu at 35ghz , and lasted about 15 minutes ( fwhm ) .",
    "furthermore , trace images reveal a jet - like eruption around 05:09 .",
    "its light curve in 1600  is a spike with a fwhm duration as short as three minutes .",
    "the jet is not detectable in microwaves and will be analyzed in article  iii .    the first flare and the following main one were most likely caused by the first and second eruptions , respectively . the eruptions stretched closed magnetic configurations and",
    "thus could facilitate escape of particles accelerated in the active region .",
    "sharp eruptions might have produced shock waves , which also could accelerate heavy particles .",
    "article  iii will consider these possibilities .      a conspicuous morphologic manifestation of a large particle event is flaring above the sunspot umbra @xcite .",
    "this feature indicates involvement in flare processes of the strongest magnetic fluxes , whose reconnection rate corresponds to flare energy release and governs particle acceleration .",
    "the flare ribbons in the events analyzed previously overlapped with the umbras of opposite - polarity sunspots .",
    "the sol2005 - 01 - 20 ( gle69 ) and sol2006 - 12 - 13 ( gle70 ) events studied in detail exhibited large variations of the peak frequency , whose maximum exceeded 25ghz , and peak fluxes at 35ghz exceeded @xmath0sfu .",
    "while the major flare in the sol2001 - 12 - 26 event looks similar to these events , its morphologic difference is involvement in the flare of a single sunspot .",
    "the microwave flux directly reflects the magnetic flux reconnection rate , being proportional to its instant value multiplied by a factor of @xmath165 at optically thin frequencies .",
    "the major difference between the moderate first flare and much stronger main flare was in the reconnected magnetic flux , while parameters of the acceleration process manifesting in the number density and power - law index of accelerated electrons remained almost unchanged .    with the same magnetic - flux reconnection rate ( and presumably the same production of accelerated particles ) , the microwave response strongly depends on magnetic fields , including symmetry of the configuration . if it is asymmetric , then the microwave spectrum is broader , the peak frequency is lower , and its variations are small .",
    "the asymmetry of the configurations can cause an additional scatter within a factor of four in the correlations between high - frequency microwave bursts and near - earth proton fluxes .",
    "an indication of asymmetry is overlap of the flare ribbon(s ) with the umbra of a single , or two , or no sunspot .",
    "both flare parts were typical arcade flares , whose development is described by the 3d model .",
    "its intrinsic phenomena are the motions of the arcade legs visible in microwaves with their bases visible as the ribbons .",
    "their initial approach nearly along the neutral line reflects consecutive involvement in reconnection of structures corresponding to the pre - eruptive magnetic field vector distribution .",
    "it is similar to that one in a nonlinear force - free flux rope , _",
    "i.e. _ from strongly sheared low structures to less sheared those located at increasing distances from the axis . a later expansion of the ribbons is accounted for by the 2d model .    in spite of a seeming single - loop configuration visible in microwave images",
    ", the correspondence between the positions and motions of the uv ribbons and non - thermal microwave sources evidences that accelerated electrons emitted microwaves from the multi - loop arcade rooted in the uv ribbons .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a simple modeling of the microwave spectrum .",
    "configurations with more than one loop appear to be common in various flares : from small , spiky events @xcite to large , long - duration events ( @xcite and the present article ) .",
    "our analysis has demonstrated that dissimilarities between the structures visible in non - thermal and thermal emissions are due to different instrumental characteristics and different dependencies of the emissions on the magnetic field . in accordance with well - known models ,",
    "a proxy of a configuration responsible for non - thermal emissions could be a structure observed in thermal emissions .",
