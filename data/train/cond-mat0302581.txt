    "the classical model for granular media stability was proposed at the end of the xviiith century by ch .",

    "modern developments have elaborated sophisticated empirical approaches around this fundamental idea @xcite but so far there is no deep physical understanding nor rigorous derivation describing the passage from the granular level description to a set of evolution equations involving macroscopic quantities such as stress , strain or packing fraction .",
    "furthermore , there is an additional difficulty to apprehend complex behaviors such as aging under stress or to account for the influence of external parameters such as surrounding humidity which effects are often noticed in practice .",
    "note that similar questions are still under active consideration in the field of tribology @xcite , but in the case of granular assemblies , a supplementary difficulty lies in the fragile character of granular structures which can be easily modified under the action of external constraints",
    ".    dynamical behavior of slowly driven granular materials was investigated by different groups both in compression and/or in shearing experiments @xcite . here we present an experimental situation of the same type , but in a quite different geometry .",
    "we investigate the rheology of a granular assembly confined in a cylindrical column and pushed vertically from the bottom . the resistance to vertical motion as well as",
    "the blocking / unblocking transitions reveals a phenomenology possibly shared by many confined granular assemblies .",
    "note that this column configuration may help to understand several practical situations like pipe flows @xcite , compaction under stress or dense granular paste extrusion .",
    "a previous investigation of the same display was made in 2d @xcite and also in 3d @xcite as a preliminary report , and more recently see refs @xcite .",
    "those contributions have shown a rich phenomenology partly sorted by the solid friction properties of the grains and the boundaries .",
    "the importance of surrounding humidity was also evidenced @xcite as it would strongly influence the rheology of the granular column . in this report , we push further the investigation as we change the column material , the beads characteristics and size dispersity , under various humidity conditions .",
    "we also propose to compare our data with the outcome of a simple numerical model of isotropic elasticity .    in the classical situation of newtonian fluid pushed by a piston ( typically in a syringe )",
    ", one would obtain a relation between pressure and flow rate , which is characterized by a fluid constitutive parameter : the viscosity .",
    "for an isotropic elastic medium the resistance to pushing would depend on the material poisson s ratio and wall frictional properties @xcite ( we will detail this question further in the text ) . for a granular material ,",
    "the situation is a priori more complex since the piling structure can be modified so as to adapt to the external constraints .",
    "friction at the walls may also create internal granular recirculation flows @xcite",
    ". therefore it is an important but difficult matter to clarify the rheology of this system by sorting the respective influence of grain - boundary friction versus bulk structural changes . along this line",
    "we started with a simple situation of weakly frictional steel beads with frictional boundaries .",
    "a second situation is studied where the granular material is made of rugous polydisperse glass beads .",
    "most experiments are performed on dry , non cohesive and monodisperse steel beads of diameter @xmath2 mm piled into a vertical duralumin or brass cylinder of diameter @xmath3 mm .",
    "we also perform a series of experiments on a miscellany of glass beads of three diameters ( 1.5 mm , 2 mm and 3 mm ) with equal volume of each kind , in a pmma cylinder .",

    "the resistance force @xmath12 encountered by the piston is measured as a function of time .",
    "we also monitor the relative humidity ( @xmath13 ) and the surrounding temperature .",
    "we work in the range @xmath14 , as well as in dry air ( @xmath15 ) and humid air ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "actually , except for the dry and humid situation , we do not regulate this last parameter ( @xmath13 ) but we record its values close to the experimental set - up .",
    "we obtain dry air by having a weak air flux ( @xmath17 ) flow into a cylinder filled with silica .",
    "we obtain humid air by making a weak air flux ( @xmath17 ) bubble through water .",

    "note that a stationary relative humidity is reached in a few minutes .",
    "we start our experiments when this stationary level is attained .",
    "we verified that the weak air flux does not perturb the system : we notice no evolution of the force when the flux is stopped as long as relative humidity remains unchanged .",
    "temperature is kept at @xmath18c .",
    "we actually find no correlation between the force fluctuations and the temperature variations in this range .",

    "two granular systems will be studied . first a model assembly of monodisperse steel spheres and second a polydisperse assembly of rough glass beads .",
    "the largest part of this report is devoted to the monodisperse assembly .",
    "we now report on the simplest situation i.e. monodisperse low frictional steel beads in a duralumin or brass cylinder .",
    "we observe two distinct dynamical stationary regimes ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) : for high driving velocities , the motion is characterized by a steady - sliding and a constant pushing force ; for low velocities , the system undergoes a dynamic instability characterized by a stick - slip motion .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "when a dense packing ( @xmath30 ) is prepared by rain - filling , the force in the steady sliding regime increases up to a maximum , then decreases slowly for a piston displacement of about 3 mm . at this point where a stationary value @xmath31 of the force is attained",

    ", we always get a stationary regime characterized by the same pushing force @xmath31 , which depends on driving velocity @xmath7 , relative humidity @xmath13 and packing s height @xmath36 , as well as the same packing fraction ( @xmath37 ) , independent of @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath36 .",
    "the stick - slip regime displays a similar phenomenology : the piling reaches a stationary packing fraction of @xmath37 ; in the transitory regime , the pushing force for dense packing displays a maximum and for a loose packing shows a monotonous increase . in section [ iii.a.1 ]",

    "[ fig3 ] at @xmath28 during 5 mm of sliding.,width=264 ]    next , we study the mean pushing force @xmath31 behavior as a function of the packing height , the driving velocity and the relative humidity .      for a vertically pushed granular assembly , the driving force exerted by the piston is screened due to friction with the walls . to evaluate this effect , the mean resistance force @xmath31 in the steady - sliding regime",
    "is measured as a function of the packing height ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the resistance force @xmath31 increases very rapidly with the packing s height @xmath36 . following the standard janssen screening picture ,",
    "this strong resistance to motion is due to the leaning of the granular material on the walls created by the horizontal redirection of vertical stress in association with solid friction at the sidewalls .",
    "it means that we may relate horizontal and vertical stresses averaged on a slice at height @xmath41 by an effective relation : _",
    "zz(z)=k_rr(z)where @xmath42 is called janssen s redirection constant . at the walls ,",
    "we suppose a sliding of the granular material at a velocity @xmath43 ( the driving velocity ) ; the shearing stress is then _",
    "rz(z)=_d(v_0)_rr(z)where @xmath44 is the dynamic coefficient of friction between the beads and the cylinder s wall at a velocity @xmath43 .",
    "the constant @xmath45 is introduced in order to differentiate between pushing and pulling experiments .",
    "when @xmath46 the granular material is moving upwards and friction is fully mobilized downwards ( our pushing experiment ) and when @xmath47 the granular is moving downwards and friction is fully mobilized upwards .",
    "the force @xmath48 exerted by the grains on the piston can be derived from equilibrium equations for all slices , thus we obtain : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass density of the granular material , @xmath51 is the cylinder radius and @xmath52 the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the length @xmath53 is the effective screening length .",
    "it is easily seen from ( [ 1 ] ) that when @xmath54 , any slight change in @xmath55 or @xmath42 is exponentially amplified with a drastic influence on the pushing force @xmath31 . in the steady state regime ,",
    "the experimental data obtained for a given pushing velocity @xmath7 can be fitted by relation ( [ 1 ] ) by adjusting only one parameter i.e. p_+1=k_d(v_0)where @xmath56 is the dynamic coefficient of friction at velocity @xmath57.we see on fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the data are well fitted by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , and , for a relative humidity @xmath58 , for steel beads in the duralumin cylinder , we obtain @xmath59 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "we are now able to propose an interpretation of the features observed for different initial packing fractions within janssen s framework . since janssen s coefficient @xmath42 is an increasing function of the packing fraction , as it was shown previously @xcite , the resistance force of an initially dense packing displays a maximum , as a dense packing leans more efficiently on walls than a loose one ; the pushing force then decreases while the packing loosens ( i.e. while @xmath42 decreases ) . on the other hand , for an initially loose packing the resisting force in the transitory regime will increase while the packing densifies ( i.e. while @xmath42 increases).for an initially dense packing , we extract a parameter @xmath63 from a fit of the pushing force maximum value in the transitory regime with formula ( [ 1 ] ) : we obtain @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath64 at @xmath66 ; as this experiment was not repeated sufficiently , we do not have uncertainties on these values . nevertheless , we notice that the @xmath63 value is roughly 25% higher than the @xmath67 stationary value , whatever the velocity is .",
    "these results are consistent with a @xmath42 dependence on compacity @xmath32 derived in @xcite for an assembly of monodisperse glass beads , i.e. @xmath68 ; for initial compacity @xmath69 and steady - state compacity @xmath35 , this empirical formula actually leads to @xmath70 . therefore , in the janssen framework , we are led to attribute the difference between maximum force and stationary force to a difference in stress redirection ( i.e. in @xmath42 ) due to a difference in compacity .",
    "the force history in the transitory regime would then just reflect the compacity history .    as a check of consistency , we perform the following dynamical experiment .",
    "first , the granular column is pushed upwards in order to mobilize the friction forces downwards and far enough to reach the steady state compacity . starting from this situation , the friction forces at the walls are reversed by moving the piston downwards at a constant velocity @xmath71 , until a stationary regime is attained .",
    "note that this stationary regime is characterized by the same compacity @xmath72 as in the pushing situation .",
    "following relation ( [ 1 ] ) , this procedure would imply a change of @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , and consequently , the dynamical force on the piston should decrease from @xmath76 to @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the pushing force @xmath77 is measured for different packing heights @xmath36 .",
    "the fit of experimental results with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) gives @xmath78 which is @xmath79 larger than @xmath80 .",
    "this difference , though small , can be observed out of uncertainties , and is systematic .",
    "it can not be due to a slight change in compacity @xmath32 as from relation @xmath81 , we would expect a 2% variation in compacity between the pushing and the pulling experiment , which would be observed ; we actually measured @xmath82 . according to janssen s picture",
    ", this would imply that vertical stress redirection is more efficient in the downward pulling situation .",
    "we believe this is a clear evidence of a granular structuration effects but its also shows that this effect is not dominant : it affects only @xmath79 of the average mechanical parameter @xmath42 .    we have shown in another report that in a janssen experiment , an isotropic homogeneous elastic material can also be characterized by stress redirection properties @xcite . for a granular column at high depth an effective relation : _ zz = k_el_rris obtained with k_el=_p/(1-_p)where @xmath83 is the material s poisson coefficient .",
    "this actually leads to a curve similar to janssen s saturation curve as long as friction at the walls is small ( typically less than @xmath4 ) .",
    "+ in order to get the isotropic homogeneous elasticity prediction for the pushing experiment , we perform a series of numerical simulations using finite element method @xcite .",
    "the column is modelled as an isotropic elastic medium .",
    "we vary the friction at the walls @xmath84 , the young modulus @xmath85 and the poisson coefficient @xmath83 .",
    "we impose a rigid , either perfectly stick or perfectly slip bottom .",
    "we find no appreciable difference between these two previous cases .",
    "the condition @xmath86 is imposed everywhere at the walls ( for the pulling situation , we impose @xmath87 ) .",
    "the cylinder is modelled as a duralumin elastic medium .",
    "as long as the young modulus @xmath85 of the elastic medium is less than @xmath88 mpa , which is usually the case for granular media , we find no dependence of the results on @xmath85 .",
    "we verified that in all the simulations we performed , there is no traction in the elastic medium , so that this could be a fair modelling for a granular material .",
    "we find no appreciable difference between the elastic prediction ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) and the curve given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , regarding the dependence of the stationary state force @xmath31 on the height of beads , our system can not be distinguished from an elastic medium .",
    "note that finite element simulations show that the presence of a rigid bottom implies that the effective janssen s parameter @xmath90 extracted from janssen s scaling for the pulling situation is higher than @xmath91 @xcite , whereas for the pushing @xmath92 ( as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] : the fit of the elastic curve with @xmath89 is good ) .",
    "details on this numerical work will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "actually , if we adjust the elastic predictions for pushing and pulling experiments with an elastic material of poisson coefficient @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) yields a janssen s constant @xmath90 for the pushing which is about @xmath94 lower than @xmath90 for the pulling .",
    "this is qualitatively ( though not quantitatively ) in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "then isotropic elasticity can be a good framework only if we neglect the existence of bulk structuration effects inducing differences in the effective poisson coefficient of the material between the pulling and the pushing .",
    "note that in this case , an isotropic modelling of the granular material is somehow questionable .    in a previous study @xcite , it was found that the janssen picture has a general tendency to slightly underestimate the stress below a granular column for a homogeneous packing of glass beads .",
    "we have showed in another report that it is no more true as the friction at walls is very well controlled .",
    "therefore , this model , though elementary , seems a fair base for analysis and provides an analytical expression from which constitutive rheological parameters can be extracted .",
    "a central question is still that the fitting parameters @xmath95 extracted from the model does not allow to distinguish between @xmath84 and @xmath42 separately .    in the following",
    ", we will show experiments which aim at sorting out the relative contributions of wall - bead interactions ( i.e. @xmath84 ) and bulk properties ( i.e. @xmath42 ) which have an influence on the rheological properties when velocity and relative humidity are changed .",
    "the mean resistance force @xmath31 in the steady - sliding regime increases strongly when the velocity and the relative humidity are increased . in the duralumin column ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , the resistance force @xmath31 at velocity @xmath29 is @xmath96 higher for relative humidity @xmath97 than for @xmath98 ; near the transition to the stick - slip regime ( @xmath99 ) , dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath13 is much less important , and there is actually no difference in @xmath31 values for @xmath13 varying between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "another important feature is that the increase of @xmath31 with velocity is sharper when @xmath13 is higher . in the brass column",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , the mean resistance force @xmath31 also increases with relative humidity @xmath13 , but now the variation coefficient with velocity ( the slope on fig . [ fig10 ] ) does not seem to depend on @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , for a velocity @xmath102 , the @xmath31 increase is only @xmath103 from dry to humid ( @xmath16 ) atmosphere .     in the steady sliding regime for height @xmath104 ( 380 g ) of steel beads in the duralumin cylinder , for various relative humidities @xmath13 : @xmath105 ( diamonds ) , @xmath106 ( open inverted triangles ) , @xmath107 ( triangles ) , @xmath100 ( open circles ) , and @xmath108 ( squares ) .",

    "the fundamental differences of behavior in the steady sliding regime between the duralumin column and the brass column for a same granular material , at same density , suggest that the variations in @xmath13 and velocity have an influence mainly on the coefficient of friction @xmath84 at the walls , and little on mechanical properties of the granular material ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , we will consider @xmath42 as a constant at first order of approximation .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows that dynamical parameter @xmath113 is globally less important in a dry atmosphere than in the ambient atmosphere . in ambient atmosphere ( @xmath114 ) , a change in @xmath13 seems to change only the variation coefficient of @xmath113 with velocity : i.e. the increase of @xmath113 with velocity is sharper when @xmath13 is higher .",

    "aging occurs with a non - constant applied shear and the mean shear is more important when the aging time is higher .",
    "consequently for high waiting time or stick time , i.e. for high mean shear at the walls , the aging of the static friction coefficient may be accelerated.this phenomenology may be a priori different for different surfaces , which would explain why aging seems perfectly logarithmic in the brass column , and not in the duralumin column .",
    "now , the high enhancement of the blocking resistance force @xmath138 with decreasing driving velocity can be simply understood within the janssen framework .",
    "we start from the experimental observation that the minimum force @xmath139 after a slip does not depend on velocity ( at constant relative humidity @xmath13 ) : @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the aging time @xmath146 before a slip reads : @xmath203 we suppose , as well verified experimentally , that the coefficient of friction @xmath148 at the walls follows a logarithmic aging law : @xmath204 this value of @xmath205 for aging time @xmath146 can be injected in formula ( [ 3 ] ) .",

    "we are therefore able to test this model predictions with the observation of response to an abrupt variation of velocity .",

    "@xcite for the pushing of a stick in a granular material , and to the one observed for aluminium beads by kolb et al .",
    "@xcite in the same display as ours but in 2d .",
    "it was however much more important in that last study in 2d : the force @xmath138 would then increase from @xmath268 after a big slip event to @xmath269 before the next big slip event .     during a stick and @xmath270 during a slip of a height @xmath271 ( 126 g ) of a miscellany of glass beads in the pmma cylinder for three driving velocities : a ) @xmath272 ; b ) @xmath273 ; c ) @xmath264.,width=264 ]    we analyse this phenomenon by studying the distribution of force amplitudes defined as @xmath274 for the @xmath275 stick event , and @xmath276 for the following slip event ( fig .",
    "[ fig24 ] ) .",
    "we observe the evolution of these distributions with increasing velocity .",
    "@xmath266 distribution remains centered around a mean value ; however , this distribution gets larger when the velocity is increased . for lower velocities ( @xmath277 on fig .",
    "[ fig24]a ) , stick - slip is regular , and @xmath267 distribution is regular around same mean value as @xmath266 ( with nevertheless a larger distribution ) . when velocity is increased , the distribution is still predominant around same mean value as @xmath266 but many smaller values start to merge in the distribution ( @xmath278 on fig .",
    "[ fig24]b ) ; these small values become as frequent as the larger ones for higher velocities ( @xmath279 on fig .",
    "[ fig24]c ) .",
    "the distribution also enlarges to the higher values which corresponds to occurrence of the big slip events .",
    "note that in these experiments , the transition to steady - sliding regime occurs for velocity a velocity around @xmath280 .",
    "several explanations can be proposed to account for this complex dynamics exhibiting a large distribution of energy release . in our point of view",
    ", the principal ingredient for an explanation seems to be the progressive structuration of the packing between two big slip events . in the janssen model picture ,",
    "the progressive increase of @xmath138 in a cycle corresponds to progressive increase of janssen s constant @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath42 value increases from an initial value @xmath281 at the beginning of a cycle up to a maximum value @xmath282 at the end of the cycle , and is reinitialised by a big slip event to value @xmath281 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath42 was found to increase with density in another report @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this dependence was shown in section [ iii.a.1 ] .",
    "therefore , a way to obtain the phenomenology is to start from a loose packing at the beginning of a cycle ; if each small slip event densifies the packing ( as can be expected from compaction under vibration ) , it leads to a small increase in @xmath42 , so that the minimum force @xmath139 at the end of the slip is higher than the force @xmath139 at the end of the preceding slip ; the maximum force @xmath138 at the end of the stick is also higher than the force @xmath138 at the end of the preceding stick .",
    "sometimes , big events occur ; they probably correspond to convective motion at the walls , as observed by kolb et al . in 2d @xcite , which loosens the packing , which then gets the initial density of the cycle .    for the interpretation we give , the stick events last a constant time as the aging time of contacts at the walls",
    "is still controlled by the velocity .",
    "this explains why the distribution of @xmath266 is still centered on mean value contrary to @xmath267 .",
    "but still a criterion for big slip events has yet to be found ; it may be the level of stresses , or a dilatance effect at high density causing shear band and convection rolls .",
    "the regularity of stick - slip motion at low velocities can be understood if the criterion for big slip events is at an upper stress level .",
    "a slow driving velocity leads to long aging of contacts at the walls so that the maximum force @xmath138 is always greater than the threshold to obtain a big slip .",
    "all slip events are then big slip events in this case .",
    "this transition from a simple steady stick - slip to a complex dynamical regime with a large distribution of elastic energy release is an interesting issue and we plan to pursue further the investigation trying to clarify in particular the role of disorder and polydispersity in the phenomenology .",
    "we presented an experimental report on the dynamical behavior of a granular column pushed vertically .",
    "we first investigated the case of a monodisperse assembly of steel beads and we observed at low driving velocities ( @xmath283 ) a steady behavior such that the pushing forces increase roughly logarithmically with velocity . on the other hand , at very low driving velocity ( @xmath1 ) , we evidenced a discontinuous and hysteretic transition to a stick - slip regime characterized by a strong divergence of the maximal blockage force when the velocity goes to zero .",
    "all this phenomenology is strongly influenced by surrounding humidity : generally , higher humidity level increases strongly the resistance to pushing .",
    "finite elements numerical simulations were used to confront experimental results to a modelling of the granular packing as an isotropic elastic medium .",
    "then , we showed that a simple janssen s model is a fair base for analysis as it provides the correct physical interpretation for the pushing resistance .",
    "this janssen s model was used to extract an important mechanical parameter combining the effects of stress redirection and wall friction but there is an inherent difficulty to isolate clearly the various contributions either coming from bulk reorganization or from the surface friction properties .",
    "using different column materials and measuring directly the friction of a grain with the wall , we accumulated several evidences leading us to conclude that the force dependence with driving velocity and humidity is strongly related to the bead - wall friction properties : ( i ) in the steady limit grain / wall tribology measurements show a friction force increasing with humidity and velocity , ( ii ) in the stick - slip regime , the blockage enhancement can be related to humidity induced aging of the bead - wall friction , ( iii ) the hysteretic transition mechanism from stick - slip to steady - sliding is similar to the one observed in solid - on - solid experiments @xcite .    in spite of a dominant surface effect , we could also identify contributions of bulk structurations .",
    "for example , we related the transitory part of the response to pushing to a dependance of the coefficient of redirection between horizontal and vertical stress with packing fraction .",
    "also a clear difference of the mechanical parameters extracted from pushing and pulling experiments shows a contribution from restructuration of about 20% .    a second system , made of polydisperse assemblies of glass beads , was investigated .",
    "we emphasize the onset of a new complex dynamical behavior , i.e. the large distribution of blockage forces evidenced in the stick - slip regime close to the transition .",

    "we thank j. lanuza and p. lepert for technical support .",
