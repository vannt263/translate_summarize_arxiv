    "in high energy scatterings , gluon bremsstrahlung radiation plays a crucial role in describing the rapid rise of gluon density inside hadron and nucleus .",
    "the soft gluon radiation is ingeniously encoded in the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation  @xcite which resums small-@xmath0 logarithms . as a result",
    ", the energy evolution of off - shell unintegrated parton distribution function in dilute limit is governed by the bfkl equation in contrast to the well known dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution for collinear parton densities  @xcite . in phenomenology , to describe particle productions in hadronic collisions in the small @xmath0 and low transverse momentum transfer region , we need to take into account the off - shellness of incident partons  @xcite , and switch from collinear factorization framework to @xmath3-factorization framework ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "study of inclusive particle productions in high energy hadron - nucleus / nucleus - nucleus collisions has attracted a lot of attention in the past few years , since this process can help to reveal nonlinear gluon dynamics on top of the linear bfkl evolution when gluon density inside large nucleus is sufficiently high . as collision energy increases ,",
    "the gluon occupation number in the low-@xmath0 region inside nucleus becomes large due to gluon bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the subsequent balance between the gluon bremsstrahlung and recombination leads to the phenomenon of gluon saturation  @xcite or color - glass - condensate  @xcite . in principle",
    ", the so - called saturation scale @xmath4 separates the nonlinear dense regime @xmath5 from dilute regime @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the typical scale of the external probe .",
    "since @xmath4 is enhanced by a factor @xmath8 for heavy nuclei with @xmath9 being the number of nucleon , current proton - nucleus ( p@xmath9 ) collision and a future electron - ion - collider are expected to provide unique opportunities to investigate the gluon saturation phenomenon . in particular , the measurement of the nuclear modification factor @xmath10 at rhic and the lhc  @xcite reflects the relatively different strength of the saturation phenomenon in pp and p@xmath9 collisions and it has been described by various theoretical calculations  @xcite in small-@xmath0 physics .    furthermore , inclusive single hadron production in p@xmath9 collisions ( @xmath11 ) has been studied in the small-@xmath0 formalism based on the mueller s dipole model  @xcite . in particular , at forward rapidity , the longitudinal momentum fraction of target nucleus carried by incoming parton becomes small and the saturation scale for heavy nuclei is much larger than typical hadronic scale @xmath12 , whereas the saturation scale of the proton projectile is expected to be much smaller .",
    "therefore , as long as we focus on the forward hadron production , the so - called hybrid treatment , in which the collinear parton coming from projectile proton scatters off dense gluons inside target nucleus with finite transverse momentum transfer , is considered to be a reasonable and simple approach  @xcite . in the hybrid formalism",
    ", hadron productions in p@xmath9 collisions are given by the convolution of short distance hard parts , collinear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for projectile proton , fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for produced hadron , and the wave function of target nucleus constructed from multi - point wilson line correlators .",
    "in general , multi - point wilson line correlators obey the so - called jimwlk evolution equation  @xcite . in phenomenological studies ,",
    "large-@xmath2 and mean field approximations are usually utilized to reduce multi - point wilson line correlators to products of dipole correlators which resum the small-@xmath0 logarithm @xmath13 by means of the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inclusive hadron production in p@xmath9 collisions beyond leading order ( lo ) has been firstly studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where the running coupling bk equation is employed together with the lo framework .",
    "these studies included a subset of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections .",
    "the pursuit of complete nlo calculations began several years ago  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the systematic nlo calculations is carried out for the first time at the high energy limit .",
    "it is shown that the collinear divergences and the rapidity divergences , which arise from one - loop diagrams at nlo , are clearly separable from the partonic hard scattering part in the small-@xmath0 formalism for inclusive hadron production in p@xmath9 collisions .",
    "this allows us to establish an effective factorization in the hybrid formalism at the one - loop order .",
    "the small-@xmath0 factorization formula for inclusive hadron production at forward rapidity @xmath14 with transverse momentum @xmath15 in p@xmath9 collisions can be cast into  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is longitudinal momentum fraction of projectile proton carried by incoming parton , @xmath1 is transverse momentum of gluon coming from target nucleus with longitudinal momentum @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . in addition",

    "this dipole amplitude encodes all the important information on the scattering between incoming partons and target harons . @xmath26",
    "represent the partonic scattering processes at nlo convoluted with the dipole amplitude .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath27 dependence of the pdfs and the ffs is derived from the dglap equation due to quantum evolution , while the rapidity or energy dependence of the dipole amplitude is described by the bk equation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the improved numerical calculation for inclusive hadron production in p@xmath9 collisions at nlo is performed and it yields the inclusive hadron spectra which are in excellent agreement with both rhic and the lhc data for various kinematical regions . nevertheless , it is still hard to tell whether this agreement is due to the non - linear gluon saturation phenomenon or the linear bfkl dynamics , since we do not know for sure whether the saturation effect is indispensable to describe the current data in pp / p@xmath9 collisions or not . in order to disentangle these two effects ,",
    "it is very useful to conduct a comparative nlo calculation for single hadron production in pp collisions with only linear bfkl dynamics , which would help us clearly visualize the different behaviour of linear and non - linear dynamics in the hadron @xmath28 spectra and eventually lead us to better understanding of the onset of gluon saturation phenomenologically .",
    "the objective of this paper is to calculate the nlo forward inclusive hadron production in pp collisions in the small-@xmath0 formalism in the dilute regime . as a cross check",

    "<S> , we compare our results with the previous calculation for non - linear proton - nucleus collisions in the small-@xmath0 formalism and find complete agreement in the dilute and large @xmath2 limit . in phenomenology , the direct comparison of the above two separate calculations can reveal the role and strength of the non - linear dynamics in high energy qcd , and thus help us reliably study the onset of gluon saturation when genuine non - linear interactions become important . </S>"
