    "the nature and occupancy of the single - particle orbits for a nucleus can be determine from the spectroscopic factors ( sf ) . experimentally the sf can be measured with single - particle transfer reactions .",
    "these reactions are of two types , first one is stripping in which one nucleon is stripped from the incoming projectile , while the second one is pick - up reaction in which one nucleon is picked up by the projectile . the examples of neuton transfer pick - up recations are like @xmath6 , @xmath7 and ( @xmath3he,@xmath8 ) , while stripping reactions are like @xmath9 , @xmath10 and ( @xmath8 , @xmath3he )  @xcite .",
    "the sf is defined by a matrix element between initial state and final state corresponding to entrance channel and exit channels , respectively .",
    "it is possible to describe the capture or emission of single - nucleons in stellar burning processes by calculating the nuclear matrix elements for a single - nucleon spectroscopic factors in the nuclear structure calculations .",

    "the usda and usdb interactions are fitted by varying 30 and 56 linear combinations of one- and two - body matrix elements , respectively .",
    "the rms deviations of 170 kev ( usda ) and 130 kev ( usdb ) were obtained between experimental and theoretical energies . in the present work before calculating the sf , first we examine the wavefunctions of concerned nuclei .",

    "in the case of @xmath4al we calculated only the g.s.(@xmath16 ) . with the comparison of theoretical and experimental spectroscopic factors it is possible to check the predictive power of effective interaction used in the shell - model calculations .",
