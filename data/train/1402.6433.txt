    "many astronomical observations , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite and large - scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , indicate that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion , which suggests that our universe may have an extra component like dark energy .",
