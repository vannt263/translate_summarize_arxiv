    "ultracold atomic systems have attracted much interest since the successful realization of superfluidity in alkali metal atoms @xcite . among a number of interesting issues addressed in this field , fermionic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite , formed by loading the ultracold atoms in a periodic potential ,",
    "currently provide an extremely hot topic , where the superfluid @xcite and the mott insulating states @xcite as well as the fermi surface @xcite have been observed recently .",
    "extensive theoretical studies on attractive fermions in optical lattices have treated a wide variety of remarkable phenomena , such as the bec - bcs crossover @xcite , the superfluid - insulator transition @xcite , and the possibility of a supersolid state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-type superfluid states have been suggested in systems with trapping potentials @xcite .",
    "fermionic systems with repulsive interactions , which have also been studied extensively , provide an ideal playground where we could realize various intriguing phenomena expected for highly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "a remarkable advantage in atomic gases over condensed matter systems is that their experimental parameters are highly controllable .",
    "for example , the depth of the optical lattice potential is controlled by the light intensity , which leads to the precise alternation of atom tunneling between adjacent sites .",
    "furthermore , one can easily create low - dimensional systems by tuning the laser beam configuration with the use of interference effects . from a viewpoint of quantum simulators of correlated electron systems",
    ", it may be particularly interesting to study the superfluidity in two - dimensional ( 2d ) or ladder - type optical lattices since they are directly related to unconventional superconductors observed in 2d high-@xmath1 cuprates @xcite and also some oxides with a ladder structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is an important issue to search for an unconventional superfluid state in repulsive fermions loaded in optical lattices . in this connection",
    ", we note that there is a crucial difference between the optical lattices and the ordinary solid state systems , _",
    "i.e. _ the presence of trapping potential in the former system .",
    "it is thus desirable to clarify the effect of trapping potential in order to discuss the superfluid states of repulsive fermions in optical lattices .    in this paper , we study the stability of a @xmath0-wave like superfluid state of ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice with a ladder structure",
    "this study is motivated by the recent successful realization of a superlattice with double - well structure , which should certainly stimulate a systematic study of superfluidity on ladder - type optical lattices in the near future . as mentioned above",
    ", it is important to take into account the effects of repulsive interactions in the presence of inhomogeneity due to a trapping potential . by using the standard mean - field technique ,",
    "we first describe the spatially - modulated spin - singlet pairs in a trapping potential .",
    "we further employ the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method to take into account particle correlations more precisely @xcite .",
    "it is clarified how the superfluid state with @xmath0-wave like symmetry is stabilized in our trapped system with particular emphasis on the role played by local particle correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model hamiltonian in ",
    "[ sec.model ] , and investigate how the spatially - modulated singlet pairing with @xmath0-wave like symmetry is realized in  [ sec.bdg ] . in  [ sec.vmc ]",
    ", we use the vmc method to discuss the stability of the superfluid state in the presence of strong correlations .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we study a superfluid state of ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice . here",
    "we consider a two - component fermionic system with fermi - fermi mixture such as @xmath2yb and @xmath3yb @xcite . alternatively",
    ", we can deal with fermions with two accessible hyperfine levels such as @xmath4 for @xmath5k @xcite , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total atomic angular momentum and its magnetic quantum number , respectively . by specifying the two different fermions by pseudo - spin indices",
    "@xmath8 , we can describe the ultracold atoms in an optical lattice in terms of the ordinary hubbard hamiltonian with on - site interactions @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the strong coupling regime , where doubly occupied states hardly appear in the ground - state configuration , and then the antiferromagnetic superexchange terms between two adjacent sites become important to determine the nature of the ground state . in this regime , an effective model ,",
    "the so - called @xmath9 model , is more convenient to discuss the ground state properties .",
    "the model hamiltonian thus reads , @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of a fermion with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the pauli matrix . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the tunneling matrix and the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between nearest neighbour sites , and @xmath21 the chemical potential .",
    "the interacting fermions are trapped in the harmonic potential @xmath22 .",
    "note that the doubly occupied states are excluded at each site in the hamiltonian ( [ ht - j ] ) due to the strong onsite repulsive interactions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to elucidate the role of the onsite correlation effects from a microscopic point of view , we now compare the vmc results obtained with the gutzwiller - projected state ( [ twf ] ) with those of @xmath23 .",
    "since the gutzwiller projection is neglected in the latter , strong onsite correlation effects are not incorporated in the results obtained with @xmath24 .",
    "here we compute the local average of potential , kinetic and exchange energies , which are respectively defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "shown in fig.[fig_local ] are the profiles of particle density and the local average of energies obtained by the vmc simulations .",
    "it is seen that the onsite correlation effects hardly change the density profile of particles ( fig.[fig_local ] ( a ) ) . as a result",
    ", there is little difference in the potential energy @xmath28 obtained with @xmath29 and @xmath24 , as seen in fig.[fig_local ] ( b ) . on the other hand , the introduction of the onsite correlation effects significantly reduces @xmath30 around the center of the system ( fig.[fig_local ] ( a ) ) , because the strong repulsive interactions renormalize the motion of particles , forming heavy fermion states in the region with high particle density .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the two kinetic energies evaluated by gutzwiller - projected and non - projected states can be regarded as the site - dependent wave - function renormalization factor @xmath31 : @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) around the edge ( center ) of the system in fig.[fig_local ] ( c ) .",
    "we note that these results hardly depend on @xmath34 .",
    "on the other hand , it is seen in fig.[fig_local ] ( d ) that the antiferromagnetic spin correlations are developed among the heavy particles around the center of the system , where the energy gain due to @xmath35 is enhanced in the presence of the strong correlation effects . summarizing the above results , the onsite correlation effects enhance the energy gain by the exchange interactions , although they cause the loss of the kinetic energy .",
    "an important point is that in the high density region ( @xmath36 ) , the effective exchange coupling @xmath34 divided by the renormalized hopping @xmath37 can be very large , which is efficient to stabilize the @xmath0-wave superfluid mediated by antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "this naturally explains why the critical value @xmath38 obtained for correlated systems can be smaller than @xmath39 for non - interacting systems .",
    "note that the above conclusion holds true for the density regime with @xmath40 . for the system with higher particle density",
    ", the spatial distribution of particles is expected to form a plateau around the center so as not to exceed @xmath41 , because the strong particle correlations have a tendency to form the mott insulating state . even in such cases ,",
    "the present conclusion may be applied to the strongly correlated conducting region in the vicinity of the mott insulating state .",
    "we have investigated the _",
    "t - j _ model to discuss the stability of the spatially - modulated superfluid state in a fermionic optical ladder system with harmonic confinement . by means of the bdg equations",
    ", we have clarified that the spatially - modulated superfluid state with @xmath42-like symmetry can be realized via antiferromagnetic exchange interactions .",
    "it has been found that the spatial distribution of the pair potential has a characteristic profile with cusps and plateau , which reflects the local density of states integrated around the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , the vmc calculation of the condensation energy as well as the local average of potential , kinetic and exchange energies has shown that the local particle correlations enhance the stability of the superfluid state through energy gain due to singlet pairing in the region of high density filling ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that the strong renormalization of kinetic energy around the high density region plays an important role in stabilizing the singlet - pairing superfluid state .",
    "we think that this kind of behavior may be characteristic of the systems with nonuniform distributions of the particle density .    in this paper",
    ", we have exploited the _ t - j _ model as an effective model in the strong coupling regime . in this model the exchange interaction @xmath34 is assumed to be free parameters , in contrast to the strong - coupling limit of the original hubbard model .",
    "it thus remains an important problem to discuss the superfluidity by directly dealing with the hubbard ladder system with a trapping potential , which is now in progress .",
    "when the density of particles is increased , other states such as the mott insulating state and the antiferromagnetically ordered state may appear around the center of the system @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is particularly worth studying how the @xmath0-wave like superfluid state coexists or competes with the magnetically ordered state in the optical lattice system , which is to be addressed in the future study .",
