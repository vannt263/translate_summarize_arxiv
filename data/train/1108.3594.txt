    "remote state preparation ( rsp ) @xcite is a quantum communication protocol similar to quantum teleportation ( qt ) @xcite , regarding their ultimate goals : a sender , alice , wants to transmit to a receiver , bob , the quantum state of a qubit without sending physically the information carrier . in both protocols alice and bob",
    "need to share entanglement and the state of bob s system is remotely prepared , after alice has communicated classically to him the outcome of a measurement on her system .",
    "however , unlike qt , in rsp alice has full knowledge of the state to be sent .",
    "for this reason , while in qt the consumption of one maximally entangled state ( ebit ) and two bits of classical communication ( cbits ) are both necessary and sufficient for faithfully transmitting the state , in rsp it is possible to trade off between these two resources @xcite .",
    "for instance , a qubit lying in a given great circle of the bloch sphere can be remotely prepared with 1 cbit from alice to bob , if they share 1 ebit of entanglement @xcite . also , it is possible that alice and bob share a nonmaximally entangled state ( i.e , less than 1 ebit ) and she can remotely prepare his qubit either in a state within specific ensembles using 1 cbit or arbitrary pure states using finite ( more than 1 ) cbits @xcite .    another important aspect that distinguishes rsp from qt is the measurement strategy which alice has to employ to accomplish the protocol . in qt alice needs to perform a complete bell - state measurement ( bsm ) between two particles , one from the entangled pair shared with bob and one carrying the qubit encoding the state to be transferred . for optical implementations , this is a problem because complete bsm is not possible with linear optics only @xcite . in rsp , however , the measurement strategy is more flexible . in the simplest case",
    "it may only require projective measurements , as for instance , when bob knows in advance that alice will only prepare states lying in a great circle of the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "when the resources for rsp are the same as for qt ( 1 ebit , 2 cbits ) , alice will have to implement a generalized measurement on her qubit .",
    "this kind of measurement , which is treated within the formalism of positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) , can be implemented through a unitary interaction between the alice s system and an ancillary one , followed by measurements of both systems @xcite .",
    "the ancillary system may be just a second degree of freedom of alice s photon and thereby there is no constraint for implementing the povm with linear optics only @xcite .",
    "so far , several optical realizations of rsp of single qubits have been reported , including pure state of qubits in a superposition of single - photon and vacuum states @xcite , pure and mixed states of photon polarization qubits @xcite , and pure states of spatially encoded photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "these realizations were either probabilistic @xcite or deterministic @xcite .",
    "in the first case , which some authors refer to rsp just as conditional preparation @xcite , there is a cost of 1 cbit and the unitary correction by bob is not required . in the deterministic realizations ,",
    "@xcite have successfully implemented the povm but not the required unitary correction and therefore constituted a proof - of - principle demonstration of the rsp protocol . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the authors have successfully implemented both the povm and bob s unitary correction , making the full demonstration of rsp with a cost ranging from 0 cbits for preparation of maximally mixed state to 2 cbits for arbitrary pure states .    in this article",
    "we study the remote preparation of pure qubits states encoded in the discretized one - dimensional transverse momentum of single photons .",
    "these so - called spatial qubits are obtained when a paraxial and monochromatic single - photon field is made to pass through a double slit aperture @xcite .",
    "the advantage offered by this kind of encoding is that one can create high - dimensional qudits simply by increasing the number of slits in the aperture @xcite .",
    "recent experimental works , employing photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down - conversion , have demonstrated the entanglement between two spatial qubits @xcite as well as for two spatial qudits @xcite . among other applications , spatial qubits and qudits",
    "have been used to demonstrate hybrid photonic entanglement @xcite and a variety of quantum tomographic techniques as single scan tomography @xcite and tomography based on measurements either onto mutually unbiased bases @xcite or symmetric povms @xcite .",
    "those applications have benefited of the considerable effort for finding methods to measure spatial qubits and qudits @xcite .    here , we assume that alice and bob share 1 ebit and we discuss two measurement strategies that she could adopt to remotely prepare his spatial qubit .",
    "the first strategy is the well - known spatial postselection , where a single - pixel detector measures the transverse position of the photon between the focal and the image plane of a lens @xcite .",
    "the second strategy , somewhat similar to the one proposed by ourselves in @xcite , is a generalized measurement divided into two steps : ( i ) the implementation of a two - outcome povm where the photon polarization is used as the ancillary system ; ( ii ) the spatial postselection at the focal plane of the lens by a two - pixel detector in each output of the povm .",
    "both strategies share the common feature that the ultimate physical property to be measured is the photon transverse position . in this case",
    "a realistic description demands us to take into account the finite spatial resolution of the detection system , where the best it can be done is to locate the photon within a narrow interval rather than a point . for both ,",
    "spatial postselection and generalized measurement , we analyze , _ numerically _ , the effects of a realistic detector over three figures of merit of the rsp protocol , namely , the probability of preparation , the fidelity and the purity of the remotely prepared states @xcite .",
    "it is shown that our strategy improves these figures compared with spatial postselection , at the expense of increasing the classical communication cost as well as the required experimental resources .",
    "in addition , we briefly discuss the rsp of spatial qudits and show that by using the generalized measurement strategy we proposed in @xcite one can prepare arbitrary pure states , unlike spatial postselection alone .    before proceeding",
    ", it is worth to draw a comparison between rsp of spatial and polarization qubits . in the latter , a probabilistic rsp of arbitrary pure states",
    "is realized with @xmath0 efficiency through projective measurements @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a deterministic implementation employs povms and it is @xmath1 efficient ( in principle ) @xcite . while it is obvious that the probability of preparation improves , the fidelity and purity of the remotely prepared polarization qubits are limited , in both cases , only by the precision of the measurement instruments ( polarizers , wave plates , etc . ) so that they could be one in principle . for spatial qubits ,",
    "the strategy of spatial postselection would be the analog of projective measurement in polarization .",
    "however , here the efficiency is smaller than @xmath0 since the photon propagates in a continuous space confined within the diffraction envelope , and the detector measures only a small fraction of this space .",
    "similarly , our proposed generalized measurement strategy would be the analog of a deterministic implementation for polarization qubits , but , again , due to the diffraction we are not able to get @xmath1 efficiency . therefore , unlike polarization , for spatial qubits",
    "the relation between the figures of merit is not trivially established when one compare the two strategies , since these figures are affected by the diffraction and/or the finite spatial resolution of the detector .",
