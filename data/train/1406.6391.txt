    "grover s algorithm @xcite is a typical example demonstrating the power of quantum computation .",
    "it is designed to search within an unstructured database of alternatives . although it is used in many different applications and algorithms of quantum information theory ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , we have yet to succeed to find any explicit example how to use it to search over an actual ( quantum ) database . in the first part of the paper we will discuss how to design a ( quantum ) phone book and employ grover s algorithm to search within either for a name , or for a number .",
    "in the second part we will investigate how successful the algorithm can be if the number of elements of the database is not known ( precisely ) .",
    "this question is posed as the analysis of the distinguishability of states occurring during grover s algorithm .",
    "grover s algorithm proves to be quadratically faster than any ( classical ) algorithm performing the task and it was proven to be optimal @xcite  there is no quantum ( and no classical ) algorithm that would do the task faster .",
    "the speedup in the algorithm is in the number of oracle calls , _",
    "i.e. _  evaluations of functions @xmath0 this function evaluates , whether element @xmath1 has property @xmath2 ( a specific example is kronecker s delta which evaluates whether @xmath3 ) .",
    "a set of these indexed functions @xmath4 can be represented by the set of paired elements @xmath5 which define the database @xmath6 of @xmath7 elements . in this setting the database search is conveniently posed as a discrimination among the oracles implementing the functions @xmath8 .    for its simplicity we will switch now to the phone book analogy .",
    "if we are given the task of finding the owner @xmath2 of the phone number @xmath1 in the phone book , then the phone book is used as an oracle in the following sense @xmath9 where the function @xmath10 returns the phone number of owner @xmath2 and the function @xmath11 compares the phone numbers @xmath1 and @xmath12 , returning @xmath13 if and only if they match .",
    "the database search then consists of the identification of the oracle s input @xmath2 returning the value @xmath13 .    for the unstructured database ( which we can interpret as a search for the owner of a given phone number in the phone book )",
    "each @xmath2 is equally likely the correct one , _",
    "i.e. _  the probability of @xmath14 has the same probability for all @xmath2 s  if this would not be the case , this prior information would help us search faster in the database . therefore , in the classical case the optimal average number of oracle queries identifying the particular oracle function is @xmath15 . at this point",
    "the phone book is ( typically ) alphabetically ordered , thus , the eq .   represents an efficient implementation of the oracle function .",
    "however , the efficiency of the oracle design is not of interest in the query complexity framework .",
    "it is assumed to be `` expensive '' in a sense that it requires a lot of resources  either energy , or time to return result that is independent of implementation .",
    "this being constant justifies the necessity to count only the number of the times the oracle is used and the complexity of the algorithm is calculated in the number of oracle calls .",
    "the quantum algorithm discovered by grover identifies the oracle in @xmath16 calls , hence , the ability to discriminate quantum implementations of different oracle functions requires quadratically smaller number of queries than in the classical case . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indexed from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and choose @xmath19 .",
    "the quantum oracle is a quantum analogue of the function ( [ eq : class_oracle ] ) . in the quantum gate formalism",
    "it is implemented as a gate @xmath20 with states @xmath21 forming an orthonormal computational basis of the @xmath22-dimensional hilbert space @xmath23 .",
    "this quantum oracle is a special case of a standardly used oracle @xmath24 where @xmath25 , thus @xmath26 acts on the hilbert space @xmath27 . initializing the qubit register in the state @xmath28",
    "we obtain @xmath29 . from the construction of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oracle ] ) follows , that for @xmath31 being an element of the chosen computational basis the states @xmath32 are eigenvectors of @xmath33 with eigenvalue either one or minus one ( if @xmath2 is the searched for element ) .",
    "each call of the oracle from eq .",
    "( [ eq : oracle ] ) is in the algorithm followed by a unitary operation @xmath34 called _ inversion about average _ which acts as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the equal superposition of all computational basis states .",
    "after @xmath37 repetitive calls of the unitary evolution @xmath38 the initial query state @xmath39 evolves into @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we shall call the states @xmath43 _ grover s states_. clearly , if the condition @xmath44 is met , then @xmath45 , hence , the search algorithm succeeds  we will mark this ( in general non - integer ) `` number of steps '' with @xmath46 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is possible only for @xmath47 , when a single step is needed . in all other cases",
    "the condition can never be exactly reached ( for an integer ) , however , for large @xmath22 this does not cause any problems , as the probability @xmath48 will still be sufficiently close to the unity .",
    "the optimal number of steps scales as @xmath16 and it was shown @xcite that grover s algorithm is optimal in sense , that it reaches the boundary on the number of steps needed to find targeted element @xmath1 . for more details on grover",
    "s algorithm we refer to any quantum computation textbook , for instance @xcite .",
    "this paper contains two results on grover s oracles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : database ] we look closer at the implementation of the oracle and uncover a symmetry within the `` quantum database '' . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discrimination ] we evaluate the quantum search algorithm with unknown size of the database , which reduces to the discrimination of quantum states appearing during the grover search algorithm .",
    "let us again switch back to the phone book analogy where grover s algorithm searches over now completely unstructured phone book .",
    "not only the numbers of owners are disordered , but now , for the sake of the argument , let also the owners be stored randomly in the phone book .",
    "such database @xmath6 consists of @xmath22 pairs @xmath49 ; @xmath50 will represent phone number and @xmath51 its owner , @xmath52 will be the set of all the names ( persons ) in database and @xmath53 the set of all the numbers .",
    "let us stress that both the names and the numbers can be repeated and only pairs of them are unique .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the subset of people having the same phone number @xmath50 and by @xmath55 the subset of phone numbers belonging to the person @xmath51",
    ". then @xmath56 are grover s oracles for searching over the names and the numbers , respectively .",
    "we now make the key observation for the rest of this section .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the following identity holds @xmath57 therefore , the unitary gate @xmath58 can be understood as the quantum database ( oracle ) encoding the unstructured phone book .",
    "now we will show how grover s algorithm can be employed to search over such unstructured phone book .",
    "we introduce a programmable quantum query gate ( ` pqq ` gate ) allowing us to run grover s algorithm to search either for a name , or for a phone number in a programmable fashion , _",
    "i.e. _  the query is represented by the choice of the input state of the device and is completely independent of the ` pqq ` gate containing the information stored in quantum database @xmath59 .",
    "the ` pqq ` gate is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qqg ] and is defined by the following equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are the inversions over the respective averages , and @xmath63 is a classical ( can be made also quantum ) switch determining whether the name , or the number is going to be searched for , respectively . neither the switch , nor the quantum database @xmath59 depend on the particular value of the database query .",
    "the quantum query ( program ) @xmath64 programs ` pqq ` gate to run grover s search algorithm to identify the phone number matching the name @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the query @xmath65 implements grover s search algorithm to identify the name matching the phone number @xmath50 .    in this way we showed , that the programmable oracle , due to the symmetry ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) provides not only a way how to search for the owner of a phone number , but also the other direction  how to search for the phone number of some owner .",
    "both these searches can be made in time @xmath16 and , recalling that the database @xmath59 is unstructured in both items , it provides a quadratic speedup in both cases .",
    "moreover , the construction can be expanded by an additional type of information , _",
    "e.g. _  mailing address or email , but the overall structure remains the same .",
    "suppose we have @xmath66 possible query tasks .",
    "the database @xmath6 consists of @xmath22 distinct @xmath66-tuples @xmath67 , the oracle ( storing the database ) is given as @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the ` pqq ` gate is then integer - parametrized @xmath70 when performing task @xmath71 ( knowing all other information but @xmath72 ) ; @xmath73 is the corresponding inversion about average on register @xmath71 , @xmath74 .",
    "higher degree of free parameters allows also a wider variety of problems than the one mentioned above which just serves to fill in the information @xmath71 while the rest is known . in general",
    "we can be given a smaller subset of parameters characterizing the element we want to find in the database ( _ e.g. _  knowing the phone number and email , we might want to find the name and address of the owner ) .",
    "this general case does not differ much from the previously discussed cases .",
    "the initial state is prepared as the equal superposition over the basis states of all unknown subspaces and as a given choice on the subspaces where the information about the searched element is known .",
    "the ` pqq ` is then similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqqgen ] ) with @xmath71 indexing the possible types of searches we might want to perform  the corresponding term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqqgen ] ) for given @xmath71 will be then @xmath75 tensored with operator having identity operator @xmath76 on all the positions the information is known and respective @xmath77 on all the positions the information is unknown to us .",
    "\\a )   or b ) for the number belonging to the name @xmath78 .",
    "operation @xmath59 is independent on the type of query and can be considered to be quantum database , while operation @xmath79 is controlled inversion about average depending on the task performed  @xmath17 triggers inversion on the name space , while @xmath13 triggers inversion on the number space.[fig : qqg ] , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] b )   or b ) for the number belonging to the name @xmath78 .",

    "here we have addresed only one implementation problem : the actual design of quantum database .",
    "the questions related to writing , or deleteing entries from database we left untouched .",
    "the size of the hilbert space we search for might be unknown , or not known precisely .",
    "it is generally a difficult problem to decide what the size of the hilbert space is , especially when it might be rather large @xcite . having grover s states as resources and being able to choose only the number of steps @xmath37",
    "after which grover s algorithm stops we might therefore not know how close we are to the optimal number of steps and we want to know how reliable our results will be . this question can be recast as a discrimination of quantum states produced by grover s oracles after @xmath37 uses , hence , the question is how distinguishable the states from eq .",
    "we will investigate two extreme variations of the problem : the minimum - error discrimination optimizing the average success rate of our conclusions and the unambiguous discrimination allowing for error - free conclusions while tolerating inconclusive outcomes .",
    "our goal is to find a final measurement optimizing the associated success rates while keeping the rest of grover s algorithm unchanged .",
    "let us stress this problem is different from discrimination of grover s oracles , where one is allowed to design also the test state and to employ ancillary systems and devices in order to optimize the success rates . in ref .",
    "@xcite some results on unambiguous discrimination of grover oracles are given , stating that the unambiguous discrimination of grover s oracles is always possible .",
    "the exact protocols achieving perfect ( error - free ) discrimination of grover s oracles were investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that in order to achieve such goal the number of queries scales as @xmath80 with the size of the database .",
    "it achieves better scaling than any classical algorithm requiring at least @xmath18 oracle calls .",
    "however , the quadratic speed - up is in this case lost . as far as we know , the oracle discrimination problem is still open .",
    "grover s algorithm provides @xcite an asymptotic solution to minimum - error case quantifying the number of queries needed for vanishingly small error .",
    "before we proceed let us note that grover s oracles @xmath81 respect the following symmetry @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the shift operator with @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath85 are @xmath86 for @xmath87 and corresponding eigenvectors",
    "are @xmath88 this symmetry feature has a favorable mathematical consequence . if we take the initial state of equal superposition @xmath89 , which is invariant under the action of @xmath85 , _",
    "@xmath90 , then the output states @xmath91 will respect the same symmetry as the unitary matrices @xmath92 . in this way , for each step @xmath37 the grover states @xmath93 form a family of symmetric states satisfying the relation @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "this reduces our discrimination problems to discrimination of symmetric states @xmath96 being the set of potential output states after @xmath37 steps of grover s algorithm .",
    "let us start with the case of unambiguous discrimination @xcite . in this case",
    ", the conclusions made are certain , hence , the algorithm is exact although it requires an inconclusive result . in ref .",
    "@xcite a theory of unambiguous discrimination of ( pure ) symmetric states is described . in particular ,",
    "if we are given a set of @xmath22 pure symmetric states @xmath97 for some unitary operator @xmath85 ( such that @xmath84 ) , then using the result of ref .",
    "@xcite we can evaluate the upper bound on probability of success in unambiguous discrimination as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the test state and @xmath100 are the eigenvectors of @xmath85 .    in our case @xmath85 is given by eq .",
    "and we are to discriminate the states @xmath101 given @xmath102 .",
    "we find @xmath103 let us denoty by @xmath104 and by @xmath105 . then a single step of grover s algorithm can be expressed as @xmath106\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 , @xmath108 are pauli operators defined on two - dimensional subspace @xmath109 spanned by the vectors @xmath110 , @xmath111 , thus , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the projector onto the orthogonal subspace @xmath115 . as in the original grover s algorithm",
    "we define the angle @xmath116 via the identity @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath118    using the above form of @xmath119 we find @xmath120 the minimized elements of this function ( which is the upper bound on the success probability for unambiguous discrimination ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ( upper plot ) .",
    "since @xmath121 and @xmath122 have exactly opposite monotonicity , it follows that the maximal value ( with respect to @xmath37 ) is achieved when they coincide , _ i.e. _  when @xmath123 .",
    "this condition gives us two solutions @xmath46 and @xmath124 when the perfect discrimination is possible as the grover s states become orthogonal .",
    "also it is not surprising that ( in the limit of @xmath125 ) the success probability approaches 1 for the number of calls coinciding with the number of calls needed in grover s search . indeed , at this point different oracles lead to mutually orthogonal quantum states .",
    "relating to the question we answer in this paper , knowing the length of the database ( the size of the hilbert space ) only approximately , an interesting observation is at hand . if our chosen number of steps @xmath37 will be the closest integer larger than the optimal number @xmath46 ( we recall , that @xmath46 is integer only for @xmath47 ) but smaller than @xmath124 the unambiguous discrimination scheme can fail as the minimal term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sucgamma ] ) will be the cosine term going to zero .",
    "if @xmath126 is close to @xmath127  this happens when @xmath128  by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sucgamma ] ) the success probability will be bounded from above by @xmath17 and the search will be unsuccessful as grover s states in this case are linearly dependent .",
    "this can however exactly happen only for @xmath129 but one can get very close to this point for large @xmath22 as well and the success probability can be very small , as after @xmath46 it drops fast towards zero  see the lower plot of fig .",

    "( [ eq : success_minerr ] ) we find @xmath136 from this equation we obtain ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : graph ] ) @xmath137 again we may notice perfect discrimination ( @xmath138 ) not only at @xmath139 but also at @xmath140 when the states would be orthogonal and the minimum - error discrimination coincides with the unambiguous discrimination .",
    "for choice of @xmath37 smaller than @xmath141 the success probability copies that of the usual grover s search , and for @xmath37 larger it becomes slightly advantageous .",
    "if the choice of @xmath37 falls in the region @xmath142 $ ] , in contrast to the unambiguous discrimination scheme where the probability drops towards zero , we do not have any considerable drop in probability showing that minimum - error discrimination is in this sense superior to the unambiguous discrimination scheme . furthermore , considering only integer @xmath37 , none of the discrimination schemes can be perfect .",
    "we have introduced the concept of programmable search database ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qqg ] ) employing ( in a programmable way ) grover s oracles to search over an unstructured databases ( like phone book ) .",
    "it enables us to choose query ( either name , or phone number ) and search for its complement ( phone number , or name , respectively ) from the unstructured database .",
    "because of the symmetry of the programmable search database for any query the complexity is the same as for grover s algorithm but offers a lot of flexibility .",
    "moreover , this construction works also for higher degree of searchable items ( like mailing address , email , etc . ) .",
    "we believe this note clarifies how the grover algorithm might actually be used for searching a quantum database , especially with more degrees of freedom within which one might want to search .",
    "although we have not addressed the question of how the database would be physically constructed , this note provides an outlook on what one should consider  the symmetry of the oracle , if implemented , would make the search more universal .    in the second note",
    "we have discussed the performance of grover s search algorithm when the size of the database is unknown , but the resources ( probe state and oracles ) are available at user s disposal . we have found that the measurement point has to be chosen carefully ( even if the guess is almost precise ) , as in a small range between the points of perfect discrimination , the success probability can drop significantly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ) .",
    "this feature holds for unambiguous approach and therefore minimum error might be favored more if the size of the database is not known exactly .",
    "minimum - error discrimination seems to be more practicable as it not only overcomes the pit near @xmath141 but it also works in the presence of small errors .",
    "moreover , it might be applied more easily , as the bound for unambiguous discrimination can be hard to reach . finally , as for the number of steps smaller than @xmath46",
    "it copies the usual success probability for grover s search we see , that the measurement in the computational basis performs the minimum error discrimination . the unambiguous discrimination ,",
    "although very interesting from the theoretical point of view , is to large extent impractical .",
    "the two presented notes cover only a small set of directions of interest where only partial results are known .",
    "for example we still do not know what an actual realization might look like  quite possibly it will be a subroutine in a larger algorithmic application @xcite .",
    "other interesting directions to pursue are geometric analysis of grover s search @xcite or quantum searches under decoherence @xcite .",
