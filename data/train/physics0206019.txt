    "the recent development of laser cooling and trapping techniques has made possible the controlled realization of dense and cold atomic samples , thus opening the way for spectroscopic investigations in the low and ultra - low temperature regimes not accessible with conventional techniques .",
    "cold atoms in magneto - optical traps ( mot ) have been used as excellent tools for the measurement of ionization cross sections . in particular for alkaline atoms@xcite and for magnesium@xcite valuable data",
    "have been obtained using the trap population dynamics as a sensitive monitor of the trap loss induced by the ionizing radiation , extracting wavelength dependencies and absolute values for the cross sections .",
    "more recently ultra - cold plasmas have been created making use of laser cooled atomic samples and laser excitation to high rydberg states@xcite . to understand the relaxation of such a system towards equilibrium many phenomena such as recombination and super elastic collisions in a completely new temperature regime for plasmas have to be taken into account .",
    "moreover a frozen rydberg gas can be created with intriguing transport properties , like quasi - metallic behavior or delayed electron emission @xcite . in these systems",
    "the collective character of the dynamics is due to the strong interaction between charged and highly excited particles .",
    "the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of alkali atom vapors has attracted much interest to new aspects of photon - matter interaction arising from the coherent nature of the atomic ensemble .",
    "recently attention has been paid to the analysis of photoionization of a bec by monochromatic laser light @xcite .",
    "the products of the photoionization process ( electrons and ions ) obey fermi - dirac statistics . owing to the coherent nature of the initial atomic ensemble and the narrow spectral width of the laser ionization source , the occupation number of the electron / ion final states can approach unity , especially for excitation close to threshold . in this regime the ionization rate should be reduced by the pauli blockade and determined by a balance between the laser light acting on the atoms and the rate of escape of the ionization products from the condensed system .",
    "when photoionizing cold atoms , at decreasing temperature and at increasing atomic density , the interaction between the charged particles and the neutral `` dielectric '' background can become significant .",
    "new information about the energy transfer from the charged species to the neutral particles can be obtained using non - dissipative traps , such as magnetic traps , and using the atom dynamics as a monitor .",
    "an ion localized inside a condensate modifies the density distribution of the condensate dielectric background by attracting the atoms towards itself .",
    "the classical interaction energy between a single ion and a polarized ground state condensate at a distance typical for a condensate density of @xmath0 @xmath1 is larger than typical chemical potentials in bose - einstein condensates ( @xmath2 times 100 hz ) .",
    "this means that locally the polarization effect is important for the condensate dynamics and may even lead to a destruction of the condensate phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the observable effect depends on the interaction time between ions and condensate : apart from the recoil picked up from the ionizing photon , in real experiments stray electric fields might limit this interaction time . examining the condensate cloud remaining after the laser excitation",
    ", the atom - ion / electron interaction for weakly ionized clouds may show significant changes of the density and momentum distribution@xcite .",
    "furthermore the interaction of the charged particles among themselves will play an important role for higher fractions of ionized particles , with plasma formation and collective effects .    in this paper",
    "we report , and compare , the results for the experimental investigation of the photoionization process within a rubidium condensate and within the cold rubidium sample of a mot .",
    "the condensate photoionization process originates from the ground state , while for the mot sample results from both the ground and the first excited electronic state have been obtained .",
    "we investigated ionization by means of 1-photon and 2-photon single color processes using various pulsed and cw laser sources , more precisely 296 nm for 1-photon ionization and 580 - 600 nm for 2-photon ionization from the 5s@xmath3 ground state , 296 and 421 nm radiations for 1-photon ionization from the 5p@xmath4 state .",
    "the ionization process has been examined through the losses from the sample , a cold cloud inside a mot or a magnetic trap , or a condensate inside a magnetic trap .",
    "our approach is based on trap loss ionization spectroscopy with the photoionization losses measured as an additional decay after the trap loading .",
    "section ii recalls briefly the model for photoionization induced trap loss , concentrating on the use of a pulsed laser .",
    "section iii describes the experimental set - up and the characteristics of the applied pulsed and cw laser radiation .",

    "section v concludes the present investigation .",
    "the dynamics of the number @xmath5 of trapped atoms in a mot in the constant density regime and with the trap loading shut off , predicts an exponential decay , with a time constant @xmath6 , determined by collisions with the background gas and intra - trap collisions . in the presence of ionization by a cw laser , additional losses with rate @xmath7",
    "shorten the lifetime of the trap and the equation of evolution for @xmath5 becomes@xcite @xmath8 hence , if @xmath9 is the initial number of atoms , @xmath10 when using photons above the ground state ionization threshold on a mot , the loss rate @xmath7 contains the contributions from the 5s rubidium ground state ionization rate @xmath11 and from the 5p rubidium excited state ionization rate @xmath12 @xmath13 with @xmath14 the fraction of atoms in the excited state . that fraction @xmath14 , under standard mot operating conditions , can be calculated from the mot laser parameters as in refs.@xcite . for a cold cloud in a magnetic trap or for a condensate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : motdecay ] ) can be also applied . in that case",
    "the excited state fraction @xmath14 is equal to zero , so that the ionization loss depends on the ground state rate @xmath11 only .    in the case of 1-photon ionization by a laser with a photon flux @xmath15 ,",
    "the ionization rate is @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the 1-photon ionization cross - section and @xmath19 a geometrical correction coefficient . for a 2-photon ionization process with cross - section @xmath20 and geometrical correction coefficient @xmath21 ,",
    "the ionization rate is @xmath22 the geometrical coefficients @xmath23 take into account the spatial distribution of the laser beam and the atomic sample . for a gaussian laser beam with waists @xmath24 and @xmath25 centered on a gaussian atomic distribution with sizes @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and assuming the density distribution of the target atoms not depleted by the laser",
    ", the geometrical corrections are @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the correction approaches unity for laser beam sizes larger than the atomic sample size .",
    "the ionization photon flux @xmath15 is connected to the photon number @xmath30 and area @xmath31 , or to the intensity @xmath32 and wavelength @xmath33 by @xmath34    for the ionization by a pulsed laser with pulse duration @xmath35 , the ionization probability is @xmath36 in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : motdecaybis ] ) , the atom number left in the trap ( either magneto - optical or magnetic ) after the application of a single laser pulse is @xmath37 for a sequence of laser pulses , we suppose that each ionization process is not modified by the previous photoionization history .",
    "thus the application of a sequence of @xmath38 pulses leads to the following remaining number : @xmath39 if we apply a pulse sequence with rate @xmath40 , at the time @xmath41 the atom number becomes @xmath42 in the case of a small ionization probability , the decrease in the atom number is well approximated by an exponential decay , as in eq .",

    "( [ pulses ] ) to be valid by changing the repetition rate @xmath40 , and hence the time separation between successive pulses , and obtaining consistent results for @xmath43 .",
    "apart from changing the internal atomic state , the ionizing laser radiation also acts on the center - of - mass motion of the atoms through the scattering and dipole forces ( see e.g.@xcite for an overview and @xcite for the case of pulsed radiation ) . for ionization above threshold the excess energy of the photon",
    "is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments imparting large momentum on the electron and ion . for trap loss spectroscopy",
    "only the radiation forces xing on the atoms remaining in bound states within the trap need to be considered for additional loss mechanisms .",
    "the dissipative environment of a mot with a typical effective trap depth of 300 mk safely recaptures and cools atoms with velocities of some 10 m / s , while in a conservative magnetic trap with typical depth of 50 @xmath45k atoms accelerated to 10 cm / s can escape from the trap .",
    "the relative role of the scattering and dipole forces acting on the atoms depends mainly on the laser detuning from the atomic transitions . for most of our investigations with pulsed lasers ,",
    "the laser detuning was so large that the scattering forces could be neglected .",
    "for the case of a condensate there is a subtle difference between the effects of the scattering and dipole forces . in a spontaneous emission event",
    "the photon recoil is picked up by this atom , as long as the condensate sound velocity is smaller than the atomic recoil velocity .",
    "instead , the dipole force due to the coherent redistribution of laser photons acts on the whole condensate cloud . for a constant intensity gradient over the condensate",
    ", the center - of - mass motion of the condensate will be driven by the dipole force without internal excitation .",
    "by contrast , for laser beam sizes comparable to the condensate size , the gradient of dipole force produces also internal excitations of the condensate . for the impulse approximation in the case of pulsed radiation , a complicated phase pattern",
    "is imprinted onto the condensate cloud , which subsequently evolves into considerable modifications of the condensate density distribution , catalyzing the formation of solitons , as in ref.@xcite , or splitting the condensate cloud in pieces .",
    "part of these fragments may acquire a high enough kinetic energy to leave the magnetic trap potential , hence leading to additional trap losses . rather than attempting to model the complicated cloud dynamics , in section ivb we will only estimate the kinetic energy imparted by the laser pulse on a single atom .",
    "additional trap losses may be caused by inelastic collisions between the ionization products , electrons and ions , and the thermal or condensed cloud remaining in the trap .",
    "we have found very little information available for those very low energy collisional processes .",
    "using the cross - section for collisions of 10 mev electrons with carbon dioxide molecules@xcite or the scattering length for the electron - rb collisions reported in ref.@xcite , we estimated the collisional processes to produce negligible additional trap losses .",
    "we should also consider that , after the ionization , a recombination process produces atoms in highly excited rydberg states , and those atoms will thermalize within the condensate . during this process",
    ", inelastic collisions can lead to additional losses , whose contribution we can not easily estimate .",
    "our experimental apparatus , described in ref.@xcite , was based on a double mot system , divided into a high vacuum region optimized for collecting rb atoms in a mot and a second region of low background pressure , into which the atoms were collected for transfer to the high vacuum mot .",
    "photoionization investigations were performed in the high vacuum mot . for the experimental parameters of our mot lasers ( intensity @xmath46 mw/@xmath47 , detuning @xmath48 ) we derived an excited state fraction @xmath49 .",
    "the atoms from the high vacuum mot can be transferred into a magnetic trap , in our case a triaxial time - orbiting potential trap ( top ) . compressing the trapped cloud and",
    "applying forced evaporative cooling with rf induced spin flips , the bec phase transition was reached with typically @xmath50 atoms .",
    "`` pure '' @xmath51 condensates contained up to @xmath52 atoms in an ellipsoid whose average dimension was in the 5 @xmath45 m range .",
    "instead the dimension of the noncondensed cloud inside the top was in the 40 - 100 @xmath45 m range .",
    "depending on the chosen sequence of cooling and trapping steps , noncondensed or condensed samples with temperatures ranging from a few hundreds of @xmath45k down to tens of nk with atomic densities of 10@xmath53 - 10@xmath54 atoms/@xmath55 were prepared .",
    "the present experimental setup does not include a charge detector to monitor directly the production of positive and negative charges .",
    "thus the action of the photoionizing laser was monitored through the decrease of the atoms remaining in the trap , applying a shadow imaging detection using a 780 nm near - resonant probe laser beam .",
    "the absorptive shadow cast by the cold atoms was imaged onto a ccd camera .",
    "measurements on both condensates and very cold thermal clouds were performed after a few milliseconds of free fall of the released atomic clouds , when their typical dimensions were of the order of 30 - 300 @xmath45 m .",
    "the atomic samples remaining after the photoionization process contained a number of atoms large enough to measure their temperature and density distribution . within the magnetic trap both a sample of thermal atoms with about @xmath56 rubidium atoms cooled by evaporative cooling down to t=400 nk and a condensate were photoionized .",
    "the 4.177 ev energy threshold for ionization of rubidium atoms from the @xmath57 ground state can be reached by a single photon of 296.815 nm wavelength .",
    "alternatively the ionization threshold can be crossed using two photons aroud 594 nm , with a substantially larger radiation intensity needed since there is no resonant intermediate level for the 2-photon process .",
    "we irradiated the cold atom with pulsed lasers operating around 594 nm and 296 nm , and with a cw laser at 421 nm .",
    "the 580 - 600 nm radiation was produced by an excimer - pumped dye laser , with intensities in the hundreds of mw/@xmath58 range and a laser pulse duration @xmath35 of 10 ns .",
    "laser pulse repetition rates @xmath40 up to 12 hz were used .",
    "the excess energy @xmath59 of the ionizing photons , and therefore the kinetic energy of the released electrons , was around 8.5 mev with an energy spread due to the laser linewidth of around 0.1 mev .",
    "the 296 nm radiation was generated from the yellow radiation by frequency doubling within a bbo crystal , with 15@xmath60 efficiency .",
    "the wavelength used corresponded to an electron excess energy @xmath61 of 10.4@xmath620.1 mev .",
    "the 594 nm dye laser radiation was focused down to 80 @xmath45 m on the rubidium atoms , while for the 296 nm radiation , owing to beam astigmatism , beam waists of respectively @xmath63 mm for the mot and @xmath64 mm for the top were achieved .    for the 421 nm radiation a grating stabilized diode laser operating at 842 nm injected a tapered amplifier delivering power in excess of 500 mw .",
    "the ir radiation was frequency doubled using an lbo crystal placed inside an external enhancement resonator@xcite . around 10 mw of narrowband cw radiation at 421 nm were available .",
    "the 421 nm wavelength was chosen in order to use the 6p@xmath3 or 6p@xmath4 levels as near resonant intermediate steps for a 2-photon process from the ground state leading to an electron excess energy of 1.7 ev . when applied to atoms stored in a mot ,",
    "the 1-photon process out of the populated 5p@xmath4 is dominant , releasing electrons with an excess energy of 0.34 ev .",

    "( [ effrate ] ) the contributions due to the ionization from the ground 5s@xmath3 and excited 5p@xmath4 state , we combined fast switching of the mot laser beams with the timing of the ionization pulses .",
    "the solid line in fig.[fig:1 ] shows the exponential decay in absence of uv photoionization light , with a decay time @xmath6860 s. the dashed and dotted lines correspond to the application of the pulsed uv light to a cw and a synchronously switched mot , respectively . in the synchronous operation mode",
    "the mot lasers were switched off for @xmath69 leaving ample time for the atoms to decay back to the ground state before interacting with the uv pulse while keeping negligible the ballistic expansion of cloud . using the fraction of excited atoms",
    "@xmath14 , we derived from @xmath7 ( around one fifth of @xmath70 ) the following values of the photoionization cross - sections :    @xmath71    the ground state ionization cross - section value is in reasonable agreement with the value measured in the late sixties by marr and creek@xcite using the absorption of uv light emitted from a discharge lamp by hot rb vapors , and later derived theoretically in refs . @xcite .",
    "since we used interleaved scans for these measurements , our largest systematic error source , the intensity determination of the ionizing laser , drops out for the ratio of the two cross sections @xmath72 the error being given only by the uncertainty in @xmath14 .    also in the ground state 2-photon ionization by the yellow 594 nm pulsed laser with photon flux @xmath73 @xmath66s@xmath67 , we examined the decay of the mot fluorescence emission . using the method of interleaved cw and",
    "synchronously switched runs described above , we verified that the 2-photon ionization contribution from the excited 5p@xmath4 state could be neglected in this case .",

    "the cross - section @xmath81 @xmath82s estimated in@xcite predicts a negligible ground - state ionization with the available photon flux .",
    "the measured additional mot loss rates @xmath7 are plotted in fig.[fig:2 ] as a function of the photoionizing laser intensity @xmath83 . from these data we obtained the following value for the photoionization cross - section at @xmath84 nm : @xmath85 figure [ fig:3 ] shows the measured data for the photoionization cross - section from the rubidium excited state 5p@xmath4 for various wavelengths of the ionizing laser .",
    "our experimental points at 296 nm ( pulsed ) and 421 nm ( cw ) are in good agreement with the values previously measured by dinneen _",
    "et al_@xcite , gabbanini _ et al _ @xcite , and klyucharev and sepman@xcite , the last one for an unresolved fine structure @xmath86 state , and the two theoretical estimates of aymar _",
    "et al_@xcite . within the explored range the cross - section dependence on @xmath61",
    "is fitted by a straight line , while at larger excess energy a @xmath87 dependence is expected@xcite .      in the ionization experiment performed with uv light at 296",
    "nm a lower peak intensity ( 70 @xmath45j ) and the large beam size lead to a single pulse ionization probability of 0.002 . because a single pulse produced a loss of atoms too small to be directly detected , we illuminated the magnetically trapped atoms ( condensate and non - condensate ) with a sequence of 120 pulses , at a repetition rate of 11 hz .",
    "we performed the investigation of the ionization losses starting with an initial cold cloud of @xmath56 atoms and , varying the final rf frequency cut , we ionized clouds with decreasing temperature and increasing atom density . finally , for radio - frequency cuts below the 3.95 mhz threshold , we ionized a pure condensate .",
    "data for the peak density and the fractional atom loss are reported in fig.[fig:7 ] as a function of the final rf value .",
    "the measured total fractional losses between 15 and 20@xmath60 were compared to the single pulse loss extracted from the mot measurements described by the continuous curve in fig.[fig:7 ] taking into account the changing size of the atomic cloud into the geometric factor @xmath19 of eq.([rate ] ) and an overall scale factor of 1.5 , due to an estimated misalignement of 100 @xmath88 between the atomic cloud and the laser beam .",
    "we verified that the temperatures of the thermal clouds were unaffected by the laser pulses within the experimental uncertainty of @xmath89 .",
    "however , when using a longer time of flight before imaging for a pure bose condensed cloud ( in order to decrease the optical density , thus getting more reliable data for the number of atoms ) , we measured higher losses ( the open circle in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "this result indicates the presence of very low energy thermal atoms removed from the condensate but still trapped , albeit with a spatial density below our detection noise .",
    "thus the 296 nm laser acting on a condensate produces additional loss of low energy thermal atoms ejected from the condensate cloud . since for the large beam size and the moderate pulse energy",
    "we did not expect a significant contribution of scattering and dipole forces , we have taken these additional losses as first evidence for the interaction of ionization products with the condensate background .    using the 594 nm pulsed radiation",
    ", we irradiated the magnetically trapped atoms either with few pulses or by applying a single laser pulse .",
    "the puzzling result of these investigations was the measurement of a large loss rate , larger by a factor ten than the value expected from the previously measured 2-photon ionization cross - section .",
    "moreover , the measured trap losses depended strongly on the alignment of the photoionizing laser with respect to the magnetic trap . for perfect alignment and small clouds we expected an ionized fraction of 2@xmath60 , while losses of 20@xmath60 were observed .",
    "an example of the measured fractional loss of atoms from the magnetic trap , normalized to the laser pulse energy , is reported in fig.[fig:4 ] as a function of the wavelength of the ionizing laser .",
    "the data of fig.[fig:4 ] do not exhibit a clear evidence of threshold behavior expected for a 2-photon ionization process .",
    "these results suggest the presence of other loss mechanisms masking the ionizing process . in a magnetic trap , in fact , every process changing the hyperfine or m - sublevel leads to atom loss .",
    "the presence of more complex trap loss processes is indicated also by the spatial distribution of the atoms inside the magnetic trap after the application of a single laser pulse at 594 nm .",
    "for both the condensate and the thermal cloud of magnetically trapped atoms , we noticed that the laser pulse ejected a secondary cloud , a `` tail '' , from the original one , as shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "the shadow image of fig.[fig:5 ] , obtained after 11 ms of evolution of the condensates within the magnetic trap , shows two clouds , the upper cloud at the place of the original one and the ejected secondary cloud separated spatially , at a lower vertical position .",
    "the secondary cloud of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] contained around @xmath90 of the total number of atoms , but in other conditions the secondary cloud contained a fraction reaching @xmath91 . measuring the atomic density and temperature for the two clouds",
    "separately we derived that the phase space density of the ejected cloud was comparable to the remaining fraction of the original cloud .",
    "below the condensation threshold both remaining clouds had a phase space density far above 1 .",
    "this suggests that the laser pulse split the original condensate into two condensed clouds .",
    "both of the observed clouds were strongly deformed with respect to the unperturbed condensate showing a close to spherical density distribution after the same time of flight .",
    "the aspect ratio and orientation of the deformed cloud depended on the evolution time within the magnetic trap after the laser excitation .",
    "moreover a detailed analysis , outlined below , showed for the main cloud a negligible center - of - mass motion , while the secondary cloud acquired a center - of - mass motion during the interaction with the laser pulse .    in order to understand the nature of the secondary cloud",
    ", we used the magnetic trap as a stern - gerlach analyzer .",
    "we measured the position of the secondary condensate as a function of the evolution time @xmath92 within the magnetic trap after the application of the laser pulse , with results shown in fig.[fig:6 ] . from the oscillatory behavior of the difference in position of the center -",
    "of - mass for the two clouds we inferred that the secondary cloud consisted of rubidium atoms in the @xmath93 zeeman state , excluding the @xmath94 state with similar magnetic moment , because our detection was sensitive only to atoms in the @xmath95 state@xcite . owing to the different magnetic moment of this state , both the frequency of the harmonic sloshing motion and the equilibrium position differ from those for atoms in the @xmath96 state .",
    "a fit to the measured position data , assuming that the secondary cloud was created at the instant of the laser pulse from the position of the mother condensate , revealed that the secondary cloud started its oscillation with an initial velocity @xmath97=(-0.5@xmath620.2 ) cm / s , i.e. , a velocity pointing downwards along the vertical axis@xcite .",
    "the laser pulse propagated at an angle of about @xmath98 with respect to the horizontal x - y place and pointed downwards in the z - y plane , while the laser light was polarized along the x - direction of fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "the atoms are polarized along the direction of the bias field , rotating in the horizontal x - y plane with frequency 10 khz .",
    "changing the timing of the laser pulse with respect to the bias field rotation we found no qualitative difference in the atomic response for parallel and crossed electric and magnetic fields .    to judge how the direct mechanical effect of the laser pulse could be responsible of the observed complex behavior of the clouds and of the anomalously high losses , we estimated the role of the dipole forces in a single atom picture . placing a rubidium atom at the steepest slope of the spatial laser beam profile during the pulse , we estimated an atom to acquire a velocity of 0.8 cm / s under application of the 594 nm pulse .",
    "based on this estimate the atomic kinetic energy of 40 @xmath45k would be well below the trap depth , and direct losses due to the dipole force would not be expected . an additional puzzle is associated with the transfer of the atoms from the initial @xmath99 state to the @xmath100 final one . such a transfer could be created by a raman process associated to the absorption and emission of the laser photons , with a probability enhanced by the atomic stimulated emission as in the atom laser emission .",
    "however , the raman transfer between the zeeman sublevels is forbidden by the @xmath101 selection rule for the interaction with a linearly polarized laser field . a violation of the selection rule may arise because the trap magnetic field is not constant during the laser pulse or by fluctuations of the laser polarization on the time scale of a single pulse .",
    "notice that raman scattering processes do not produce losses in a mot , where every zeeman sublevel of the ground state is trapped and the kinetic energy acquired is smaller than the trap depth . as mentioned above , the shape of the detected clouds was grossly different from the shape of unperturbed condensates .",
    "such a shape deformation could be associated with the asymmetry in the electron emission produced by the photoionization process , exciting complicated oscillations in the original and secondary condensate clouds .",
    "finally we excited thermal clouds and condensates with the 421 nm radiation detuned by 12 ghz above the resonance and focused to @xmath102 .",
    "at such a detuning the scattering force still dominates the atomic losses from the magnetic trap , and the trap losses due to the 2-photon ionization from the ground state could not be directly measured .",
    "we observed that the condensate cloud falling under gravity through the 421 nm laser beam was split into two condensate clouds , the reflected and transmitted respectively , again without measurable additional atomic losses .",
    "note that in this case the interaction time with the laser radiation is orders of magnitude longer than for pulsed lasers , so that a complicated dynamics may be produced .",
    "we applied trap loss spectroscopy to measure the photoionization cross - sections of rubidium atoms confined in a mot making use of cw and pulsed laser .",
    "we verified that the use of pulsed lasers did not limit the accuracy reached in the cross - section determination .",
    "we demonstrated that the photoionization of magnetically trapped thermal and condensed atoms instead does not represent a precise tool for cross - section determination . in effect",
    "the magnetic trap depth is smaller than the mot depth , and the laser action on the cold atomic cloud may produce additional processes leading to atomic losses from the trap , masking the ionization losses .",
    "we have observed that both scattering and dipole forces associated with strong pulsed lasers may impart a kinetic energy large enough to overcome the trap depth .",
    "moreover , dealing with a condensate cloud , additional losses appear that are probably due to the creation of a dilute thermal cloud .",
    "we have discovered that the application of intense pulsed radiation leads to huge excitation and macroscopic splitting of a condensate without compromising its phase space density .",
    "we identified the transfer of atoms to the @xmath103 level as an important process , but the detailed microscopic mechanism remains unclear and will be subject of further studies .",
    "on the basis of the photoionization cross - sections measured within a mot we estimated to have created charged clouds and condensates in magnetic traps containing a fraction of 0.2@xmath60 and 2@xmath60 of ions at a time for the 1-photon and 2-photon experiments respectively .",
    "we have not observed any dramatic instability which could be triggered by the strong polarization of those charged condensates .",
    "however , we take the higher losses measured following the 1-photon ionization of a condensate as a first indication of the interaction between the ionization products and the condensate background .",
    "additional processes such as collisions with cold electrons and ultra - cold neutrals , recombination and collective processes in the weak and cold plasma could modify the atomic cloud evolution and in part be responsible for the more complicated dynamics observed after the 2-photon excitation in the condensate .",
    "in future experiments we plan to use cw sources to ionize condensed clouds to disentangle scattering and dipole force effects from the rich and interesting physics of cold charged particles in quantum degenerate clouds .",
