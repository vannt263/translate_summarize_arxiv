    "it has been conjectured that in ultra - relativistic collisions between heavy ions a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed for a very short period of time .",
    "later it disintegrates into the hadrons which are finally seen in the detectors .",
    "it is the challenge of the present experiments at the cern - sps and at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to find observables which unambiguously signal the formation of the qgp .",
    "one of the most promising suggestions advanced so far is the suppression of charmonium production in these collisions .",
    "it has been argued by matsui and satz  @xcite that the interaction between a heavy quark @xmath2 and antiquark @xmath3 is screened in a qgp , and consequently the @xmath4 bound pairs may not survive in this environment .",
    "the problem with this signal is that all other possible suppression mechanisms have to be well understood .",
    "whereas the general features of charmonium production in proton - proton collisions seem to be under control , already in proton - nucleus reactions the suppression is not well understood so far .",
    "only recently , data have been published which show a different suppression of @xmath0 and @xmath5  @xcite , and hence give the first hints that the @xmath0 is formed inside the nucleus .    in heavy ion collisions",
    "the situation is even more difficult .",
    "there many particles are produced which possibly collide with a charmonium and may cause an observable suppression even if a qgp is not formed at all . in order to quantify such a suppression",
    "it is necessary to know the strength of these interactions .",
    "experimentally the charmonium - hadron dissociation cross sections are not accessible .",
    "therefore one has to rely on theoretical estimates .",
    "three kinds of approaches have been advanced in the past .",
    "the first approach is based on twist expansion techniques well known from deep inelastic scattering studies .",
    "it has been launched by bhanot and peskin  @xcite and was explicitly used in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath6-@xmath7 in the approximation of a vanishing proton mass .",
    "the whole approach gives a correct approximation of qcd provided that the heavy quark mass is large enough .",
    "it has thus the very advantage to be a well defined approximation scheme of the underlying theory . for realistic systems , such as charmonia and bottomonia , power corrections are presumably non negligible , but",
    "some of them , namely finite target mass corrections , can be incorporated in a systematic way .",
    "a second attempt is formulated within a constituent quark model . in an early study martins _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have calculated a @xmath0 dissociation cross section @xmath8 by @xmath9 s of up to 7  mb at @xmath10  gev , i.e. , 0.8  gev above @xmath11 .",
    "this value has been reduced to about 1  mb for the same energy in a more recent study by wong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who used parameters adjusted to other elementary reactions .",
    "a third approach is based on hadronic degrees of freedom . invoking a local u(4 ) symmetry and employing pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector coupling ,",
    "matinyan and mller  @xcite investigated the dissociation of the @xmath0 by exchange of a @xmath12 or @xmath13 meson . employing vector dominance to determine the coupling constants they arrive at @xmath14  mb for @xmath10  gev .",
    "later , haglin  @xcite included four point interactions and a three vector - meson coupling and obtained a much larger cross section because the large suppression of the cross section due to the @xmath12-meson propagator is not present in the contact terms .",
    "recently lin and ko  @xcite modified the details of this approach and included form factors .",
    "depending on the form factor assumed they get @xmath8 between 4 and 25  mb at @xmath10  gev .",
    "the purpose of this article is to extend the work ref .",
    "@xcite in three different directions .",
    "first of all we include systematically the masses of the scattering partners using a method known from deep inelastic scattering studies .",
    "this allows for the calculation of the dissociation cross sections close to threshold where it is most relevant for the question at hand .",
    "second the cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite is derived in a different , more direct fashion , again in analogy to the calculation of the forward compton scattering amplitude in the operator product expansion .",
    "this cross section has a simple partonic expression , even when target mass corrections are included .",
    "we also explicitly derive how the reaction threshold is shifted by target mass corrections and how the cross section is modified in the vicinity of threshold .",
    "third the calculation is extended towards other hadrons @xmath15 and towards bottomonium which becomes an observable particle in the upcoming experiments at the rhic and at the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "target mass correction for @xmath0-@xmath7 cross section has been examined in the framework of bhanot and peskin in ref .",
    "these authors obtained their results in the form of sum rules . in principle",
    "these sum rules contain all of the above mentioned aspects but none is made explicit .",
    "further we were neither capable to reproduce their exact expressions for the sum rules nor to find the trend they mention for the correction .",
    "we will clarify in the course of this study where we disagree .",
    "in this section we generalize the expression obtained by bhanot and peskin  @xcite for the total cross section of a heavy quarkonium @xmath16 with a target hadron @xmath15 by including finite target mass terms .",
    "the proposed analysis is close to that performed in the context of deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "let us first collect the material we need from refs .",
    "we want to compute the @xmath16-@xmath15 total cross section .",
    "our starting point is the expression for the forward @xmath16-@xmath15 elastic scattering amplitude , @xmath17 .",

    "we note that @xmath22 is the hadron energy in the @xmath16 rest frame . via the optical theorem",
    ", the forward scattering amplitude leads to the @xmath16-@xmath15 total cross section @xmath23 notice that we use the same definition for @xmath24 as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in qcd , in the limit of a large heavy quark mass ,",
    "the scattering amplitude has a twist expansion . in the @xmath16 rest frame the leading twist ( lt )",
    "contribution is  @xcite @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the bohr radius and the rydberg energy for the @xmath4 system .",
    "the above formula displays the factorization of the process in terms of hard coefficients @xmath28 and soft matrix elements .",
    "both should be evaluated at a factorization ( and renormalization ) scale @xmath29 , to be chosen to minimize the influence of neglected higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath30 , though a precise determination fulfilling the latter requirement would need a complete one - loop computation . in the phenomenological study",
    ", we will quantify the consequences of this scale uncertainty .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 correspond to matrix elements of definite operators evaluated in the @xmath16-state .",
    "these are computable in perturbative qcd and have been made explicit in ref .",

    "we remark that @xmath28 can be expressed as the @xmath35-th moment of a given function @xmath36 through @xmath37 with @xmath38    for every @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt_amplitude ] ) a gluon twist-2 operator evaluated in the hadron @xmath15 ( _ spin - averaged _ ) state also appears .",
    "each of these matrix elements is a traceless fully symmetric rank @xmath40 tensor built from the hadron momentum @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that a tensor having these properties is necessarily proportional to  @xcite @xmath42^{\\mu_1\\cdots\\mu_{2k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tensor in the @xmath43th term on the right - hand side is the sum of the @xmath44 $ ] distinct tensors one can construct by multiplying @xmath43 @xmath45 s and @xmath46 @xmath47 s .",
    "the matrix element needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt_amplitude ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath48 and writes @xmath49 this set of matrix elements is related to the unpolarized gluon density @xmath50 in the hadron target .",
    "one can see this from the matrix element definition of @xmath50 , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , which in the light cone gauge @xmath51 reads @xmath52 in the parton model the argument of @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath53 , is interpreted as the fraction of the hadron light cone momentum @xmath54 carried by the gluon .",
    "taking the @xmath35th moment of @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 since @xmath57 in the @xmath51 gauge we recognize @xmath58 i.e. , @xmath59      in the present subsection we want to illustrate the general method in the case of vanishing target mass , @xmath60 .",

    "easily checks that the convergence radius of the power series  ( [ eq : power_series ] ) , now considered with the complex argument @xmath63 , is equal to @xmath27 . as extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the twist expansion of the scattering amplitude provides an expression for @xmath64 in the _ unphysical _ region of energies .",
    "since we are interested in _ physical _ energies we have to perform an analytic continuation of the power series .",
    "before doing so let us first elaborate on possible differences between @xmath65 and the _ full _ scattering amplitude @xmath17 , i.e. , including higher twist terms .",
    "it turns out from the analysis below that the singularities ( branch points ) of @xmath65 on the boundary of the convergence disk of the power series lie at @xmath66 .",
    "this is not what is expected for the locations of the ( first ) branch points of @xmath17 , i.e. , the locations of the thresholds for both reactions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are @xmath69 .",
    "the technical reason for the difference is , of course , that @xmath70 occurs nowhere in eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_series ] ) . in the twist expansion approach the locations of the singularities of the full scattering amplitude may be affected by higher twist corrections .",
    "we verify that this is the case for the above reactions by taking into account elastic unitarity corrections for which the thresholds are clearly located at @xmath71 . in the next section",
    "we shall see how @xmath72 corrections affect the locations of the lt reaction thresholds .",
    "since the convergence radius of the power series ( [ eq : power_series ] ) is non zero the lt amplitude always refers to the leading twist part of the forward @xmath16-@xmath15 elastic scattering amplitude and we drop the indices ( lt ) and @xmath73 for simplicity . ] can be unambiguously determined throughout the @xmath63 complex plane from the sole knowledge of eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_series ] ) , using the mellin transform machinery .",

    "( [ eq : im_amplitude ] ) by @xmath22 ( the flux factor when @xmath60 ) we recover the partonic expression of the @xmath16-@xmath15 total cross section as obtained by bhanot and peskin within a parton model approach , i.e. , @xmath84 with the @xmath16-gluon cross section @xmath85 @xmath86 corresponding to the gluon energy in the @xmath16 rest frame .",
    "aside from its energy dependence , the @xmath16-gluon cross section is driven by @xmath87 , as expected in qcd for the interaction of a small color singlet dipole of size @xmath26 .    in this formulation",
    "one important physical aspect is made transparent  @xcite : the leading twist analysis describes the @xmath16 dissociation by gluons into a @xmath2 and a @xmath3 @xmath88 to be energetically possible the gluon energy has therefore to be larger than the @xmath4 coulomb binding energy @xmath27 . in view of the fact that the confinement scale is small as compared to @xmath27 the lt analysis then provides a description of @xmath16 dissociation into open channels , e.g. , @xmath89 .",
    "let us emphasize that this dissociation is precisely the process of interest for the question of @xmath16 suppression in heavy ion collisions .",
    "an important aspect for the phenomenology of the above cross section is its limiting behaviors for both small and large energy regimes .",
    "these are linked to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 behaviors of @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it is then convenient to have in mind the simple , yet standard , parameterization @xmath92 with this ansatz one can write down exact asymptotic formulas either by following the reasoning of ref .  @xcite or by noticing that the @xmath16-@xmath15 cross section is proportional to a hypergeometric function .",
    "this is most easily done by changing variable @xmath53 to @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : im_amplitude ] ) . then one recognizes  @xcite @xmath94 for @xmath22 in the neighborhood of @xmath27 , i.e. , the @xmath60 threshold , the hypergeometric function approaches 1 and we get @xmath95 for large energies , using @xmath96 one obtains @xmath97 the high energy cross section is primarily geometrical ( remember @xmath98 ) .",
    "in addition to this simple behavior , there is a non trivial energy dependence coming from the small @xmath53 behavior of the gluon density .    for phenomenological investigations we shall also use slightly more involved forms for @xmath55 as obtained in parton distribution function studies . in this case the connection to @xmath99",
    "one may , however , derive similar asymptotic expressions by first expanding the gluon distribution either in the neighborhood of 1 or 0 .",
    "having illustrated the method for the case @xmath100 , we now turn to the general case @xmath101 . plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluon_matrix_element ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt_amplitude ] ) leads to @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "we thus get an amplitude which may be considered as a double power series in @xmath22 and @xmath70 . the study of this double series with complex arguments @xmath104 and @xmath105 shows that it is absolutely convergent for @xmath106 . in this domain , defining @xmath107 we may rewrite the series as @xmath108    the second term on the right - hand side corresponds to the power - series expansion of the scattering amplitude @xmath24 of section  [ sub : mh0 ] evaluated at the complex plane location @xmath109 : @xmath110 from the representation  ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) of the scattering amplitude we immediately see that @xmath111 is well defined and real for every ( real ) @xmath70 .",
    "we thus ignore this term in the following since it does not contribute to the total cross section at leading twist .",
    "let us now concentrate on the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_series_p ] ) .",
    "we use the same reasoning as in section  [ sub : mh0 ] considering now the double series  ( [ eq : power_series_p ] ) with complex arguments @xmath63 and @xmath112 instead of @xmath22 and @xmath113 . expressing first @xmath114 as the @xmath35-th moment of @xmath115 one can write @xmath116 in the convergence domain of the double series , the series in @xmath43 may be summed up . introducing @xmath117",
    "we may then follow another time the reasoning of section  [ sub : mh0 ] replacing @xmath114 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : moments ] ) , by @xmath118 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : moments_p ] ) .",
    "we notice in passing that the modified moments @xmath118 are analytic functions of @xmath112 throughout the complex plane except at @xmath119 .    for simplicity we restrict ourselves to physical masses , i.e. , to the positive real axis of @xmath112 where the above integral representation is well defined .",
    "then , two cases show up depending on whether @xmath120 or not .",
    "the former case is the one relevant to phenomenology but we consider both cases in turn for completeness .    for @xmath120 , we restore @xmath121 and change the variable to @xmath122",

    "we can easily follow the reasoning of section  [ sub : mh0 ] because the integration range does not play a role until one cuts the amplitude .",
    "this cutting imposes @xmath125 and thus results in a non vanishing imaginary part for @xmath126 . above this threshold @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "dividing eq .",

    "we first stress that , as in the @xmath60 case , one arrives at a simple partonic form of the cross section .",
    "this means , in particular , that the physical discussion we gave after eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_section ] ) , based on the subprocess @xmath130 , still holds in the massive target case .",
    "apart from the prefactor , the only modification between eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_section_p ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_section ] ) is the modification of the expression for the gluon energy in the partonic cross section @xmath131 .",

    "let us choose the third axis along the hadron @xmath15 momentum and form @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the parton picture the gluon causing the dissociation is picked up from the hadron @xmath15 and has a negligible transverse momentum , and hence a negligible minus momentum . its energy is then easily expressed in terms of @xmath53 , the light cone ( plus ) momentum fraction of the gluon , and reads @xmath136 , i.e. , @xmath137 .",
    "our understanding of the prefactor is more formal .",
    "we observe that eq .",
    "( [ eq : im_amplitude_p ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath138 a relation which entails the ( formal ) identity @xmath139 which can also be obtained from a direct comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : moments_p ] ) and  ( [ eq : moments ] ) .",
    "next , we point out that , as expected , the @xmath72 corrections are sizeable only for small energies .",
    "the first aspect of these corrections is that , as above mentioned , the threshold is now located at @xmath140 as in the massless case this corresponds to the need to find in @xmath15 a gluon with an energy @xmath141 sufficient to dissociate the @xmath16 . with @xmath137 and @xmath142",
    "this gives a @xmath143 threshold @xmath144 , leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : threshold_shift ] ) .",

    "we notice that the first contribution is the one already obtained in the case @xmath120 .",
    "the second term is new but contributes only in the range @xmath154 .",
    "we further point out that the relevant energy variable is now half the difference between energy and momenta , instead of half the sum for the first term , and that the present result eq .",
    "( [ eq : im_amplitude_s ] ) is again consistent with the @xmath155 sum rule  ( [ eq:-1_sumrule ] ) .",
    "finally , in the neighborhood of threshold the cross section now amounts to @xmath156",

    "the above described qcd analysis assumes that the @xmath158 binding potential is well approximated by the coulomb part of the qcd potential  @xcite .",
    "treating the 1s and 2s heavy quarkonia as coulombic states leads to @xmath159 that is @xmath160,\\\\ \\epsilon_0&=&\\frac{4}{3}\\left[m_{q\\bar{q}}(2s)-m_{q\\bar{q}}(1s)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives for charm and bottom respectively ( set ( i ) ) @xmath161    one way of estimating the applicability of the heavy quark analysis to charmonia and bottomonia is to compare the size of each coulomb - state to typical confining distances .",
    "one may first evaluate the bohr radius @xmath162 , this gives @xmath163  fm for charm and @xmath164  fm for bottom . recalling that the 1s - state root mean square is given by @xmath165 one finds that the 1s - state size remains somewhat below typical confining distances .",
    "we then consider that the lt analysis may be at least indicative of the behavior of 1s - state cross section .",
    "computing the size of 2s - states with @xmath166 , one sees that the situation is much less favorable for 2s - states , especially for charmonium .",
    "the application of the framework to @xmath167 is given in appendix  [ app:2s_states ] .",
    "in addition to the question of the validity of the computation of 2s - state cross section within the lt analysis this also led us to reconsider the above choice of parameters . for this we drop eq .",
    "( [ 2s - mass ] ) and propose to fix the rydberg energy to the energy - gap between the 1s - state and the open flavor production . with eq .",
    "( [ 1s - mass ] ) this is equivalent to putting @xmath168 for charm and @xmath169 for bottom .",
    "we then have the alternative set ( set  ( ii ) ) @xmath170 as we shall see , the cross section is only sizeable at large energy . in this region",
    "the magnitude of the cross section is driven by the factor @xmath171 ( see eq  ( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) ) .",
    "taking set ( ii ) instead of set ( i ) results in a 20%  cross section increase for charm and in a 22%  cross section decrease for bottom .",
    "it turns out that this uncertainty is smaller than the one coming from scale fixing discussed in the next section .",
    "we will therefore limit our further considerations to cross sections obtained using set ( i ) .",
    "the other important input for the computation is the gluon density @xmath172 in the hadron @xmath15 considered . at this point",
    "one should remember that this density depends on the factorization scale @xmath29 ( see paragraph following eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt_amplitude ] ) ) . in the @xmath16-@xmath15",
    "cross section , not only @xmath172 is a function of @xmath29 , but also @xmath131 .",
    "part of the dependence stands in the explicit coupling of the gluon with the @xmath16 constituents , corresponding to the factor @xmath173 in @xmath98 , though the knowledge of the full dependence requires a complete one - loop calculation .",
    "lacking such an analysis led us first to restrict ourselves to the so - called leading order ( lo ) gluon distributions ( i.e. , their evolutions are computed to one - loop ) and correspondingly to the lo  running coupling .",
    "second , we investigated with some care the variation of our results with the choice of different factorization scales .",
    "we started this analysis with the prescription suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath30 .",
    "for such a low scale the only available parameterization for the proton is that of glck - reya - vogt  @xcite , labelled grv94  lo .",
    "these authors have proposed a parameterization for the pion too  @xcite . concerning the @xmath53 dependence of the various gluon densities",
    ", one should notice that the intermediate-@xmath53 region is rather well monitored , while the small-@xmath53 region is poorly understood , especially for the pion case .",
    "thanks to the hera measurements the situation for the proton is much better . including these data glck - reya - vogt have provided a new parameterization  @xcite but its lower scale is larger than that needed for this study .",
    "however we checked that at a scale large enough for both to be compared the difference between the gluon distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is not significant .",
    "we also examined , at a larger factorization scale , the consequences of different parameterizations of the gluon distribution in the proton , considering in turn mrst98  lo  @xcite and cteq5l  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the cross section at a given energy depends on the choice of parameters .",
    "its general trend , however , is rather independent of a specific choice .",
    "we therefore begin our phenomenological study by discussing in this section those aspects that only weakly depend on the quarkonium parameters and gluon distributions .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] we have seen that one can distinguish two extreme energy regimes in the @xmath16-@xmath15 cross section : a threshold region and a high energy regime . the high - energy cross section is independent of the target mass and is given by @xmath174 for gluon densities @xmath175 at small @xmath53 .",
    "the constant @xmath176 depends on details of the gluon density and on the parameters describing the charmonium sector ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) ) . in every case discussed in sect .",

    "such a cross section is of seminal importance in the context of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the present study is a continuation of the work of bhanot and peskin and of a more recent paper by kharzeev and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "let us gather what have been carried out here .",
    "first , the leading twist forward scattering amplitude has been given a simple integral expression , entailing a partonic representation for the total cross section . such a description had been found in a different way in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of massless targets .",
    "secondly , finite target mass corrections have been systematically incorporated .",
    "we showed that the cross section still assumes a partonic form though in terms of a modified energy variable .",
    "in addition to a shift of the reaction threshold , finite mass corrections add to the suppression of the cross section at low relative energy but become insignificant far above threshold . in the case of heavy targets",
    ", however , we noticed that the cross section becomes large just above ( and even diverges at ) threshold .",
    "last , the energy dependence of @xmath215 and @xmath216 has been investigated for several targets .",
    "we found that @xmath221 and @xmath224 are strongly suppressed in the vicinity of the threshold . at large energy , the cross section is proportional to @xmath225 for a target with @xmath175 at small @xmath53 .",
    "with grv gluon distributions this leads to slowly rising cross sections for both @xmath16-@xmath9 and @xmath16-@xmath7 .",
    "however , we should emphasize that the small-@xmath53 gluon distribution are not much constrained , especially that of the pion . indeed",
    "the weak control we have on the gluon distribution , because of both the just mentioned poor small-@xmath53 knowledge and the sizeable scale dependence , turned out to be the main source of uncertainty in the present approach .",
    "the @xmath226 cross section have also been investigated , although the relevance of a perturbative approach is not fully satisfied for 2s  states .    in addition to the hadron mass corrections considered here and beyond perturbative corrections , higher twist corrections",
    "may also lead to substantial modification for a not so heavy quark such as the charm .",
    "indeed we noticed in sect .",
    "[ sub : mh0 ] that the threshold location may vary when one incorporates higher twist correction , making finite a cross section which is zero at leading twist .",
    "considerations of this type of corrections is clearly outside the scope of the present study .",
    "part of these corrections may be associated to the @xmath16 sector and in particular to the confining part of the heavy quark potential .",
    "other corrections involving higher twist operators in the hadron target have presumably their counterparts in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "as compared to the other approaches mentioned in the introduction the @xmath0-@xmath9 cross section is very tiny at @xmath10  gev . in the 47  gev energy range it strongly increases driven by the intermediate @xmath53 region in the gluon distribution .",
    "this @xmath53 region is fairly under control thanks to the momentum sum rule and consequently the prediction , within the present approach , of cross section smaller than 1  mb below 7  gev is rather robust .",
    "a consequence of such a small cross section at small relative energies is that destruction of @xmath0 s by comovers become very unlikely .",
    "we are presently studying whether our results allows already for an answer to the question whether a quark gluon plasma is formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion reactions .",
    "our present approach is , however , limited to the @xmath0 cross section , since for the excited states the binding energy is not large as compared to the confining scale .",
    "in this first appendix , we establish the sum rules satisfied by the leading twist total cross section @xmath227 .",
    "this allows us to make contact with a similar derivation done in the case",
    "@xmath60  @xcite and @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the expression for the leading twist amplitude  ( [ eq : power_series_p ] ) . expressing @xmath228 and recalling that @xmath229 is the @xmath35-th moment of the gluon density in the hadron target ( see sect .",
