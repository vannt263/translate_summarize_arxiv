    "the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is unique as it can probe regions of the sky where no stars have ( yet ) formed ( see schneider 1996 ) . within individual galaxies ,",
    "hi  is frequently found well outside the optical radius ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1996 ; salpeter & hoffman 1996 ) , and many tidal tails or bridges between galaxies are only detected in hi  ( see e.g. koribalski 1996 ; ryder et al .",
    "2001 ) . until now",
    ", the majority of hi  observations were made of objects that had first been identified in the optical ( or lately the infrared ) , thus imposing hi  selection effects on top of already existing optical selection effects .",
    "important hi  structures like the leo ring ( schneider 1989 ) and the virgo cloud ( giovanelli & haynes 1989 ) were discovered by accident and indicate the enormous potential for discovery in an untargeted hi  survey .    the sky has been extensively surveyed for galaxies at optical wavelengths ( e.g. lauberts 1982 ) but severe limitations remain , mainly due to the foreground extinction of the milky way ( which affects @xmath025% of the sky , see e.g. kraan - korteweg & lahav 2000 ) . in many optical catalogs , including the input catalogs for optical redshift surveys , low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are easily missed and galaxies with diameters less than @xmath01  are often misclassified as stars . for example , all objects with brightness less than 1.15 times the sky and objects classified as stars were excluded from the input catalog of the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al .",

    "2000 ) as well as deep optical searches for galaxies behind the southern milky way ( woudt & kraan - korteweg 2001 ) are being carried out . in the infrared less than @xmath1 of the sky is affected by foreground extinction , surveys like the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) and the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , epchtein et al .",
    "1997 ) are now cataloging large numbers of galaxies .",
    "in contrast hi  emission is _ not _ affected by extinction and enables us to identify many previously hidden galaxies .",
    "in addition , hi  can easily be detected in lsb and late - type dwarf galaxies which are generally gas - rich ( impey & bothun 1997 ) .",
    "hi  surveys complement optical galaxy catalogs and substantially improve the census of galaxies and measurement of the hi  content of the local universe .",
    "hi  surveys also clarify voids by placing reliable upper limits on the mass of objects in these regions . furthermore , there are some components of galaxies that have so far only been discovered in hi , e.g. high - velocity clouds ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ) , tidal hiclouds ( e.g. , hipass j073169 , ryder et al . 2001 ) and other nearby hi  clouds ( see e.g. kilborn et al .",

    "this view is highly selective and it will be interesting to see how large - scale surveys for extragalactic neutral hydrogen affect the current picture . until recently , the arecibo dual - beam survey ( adbs ) and the deeper arecibo hi  strip survey ( ahiss ) were the largest blind 21-cm surveys , covering areas of 430 and 65 deg@xmath2 respectively .",
