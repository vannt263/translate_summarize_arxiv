    "omega centauri ( @xmath0 cen ) is the largest globular cluster of the galaxy .",
    "it contains about one million stars of which almost 500 are known to be variable ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2004 , weldrake et al .",
    "recently , precise @xmath5 and @xmath6 ccd photometry of variables in @xmath0 cen were obtained by cluster ages experiment ( case ) team ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2004 ) . among others",
    ", they published precise light curves of 151 rr lyr stars belonging to the cluster .",
    "these light curves contained from 594 to 761 points and were collected in period from 1999 february 6/7 to 2000 august 9/10 .",
    "we conducted the search for periodicities in individual rr lyr stars .",
    "the analysis was performed in two ways .",
    "we searched for additional signal in @xmath0  cen rr  lyrae stars with the standard consecutive prewhitening technique .",
    "first , the data were fitted with the single frequency fourier sum of the form :    @xmath7    the pulsation frequency @xmath8 was also optimized in the fitting process .",
    "the fit eq.(1 ) was then subtracted from the data and the residuals were searched for secondary periodicities .",
    "this was done with the fourier power spectrum computed over the range of @xmath9 c / d .",
    "if any additional signal was detected , a new fourier fit with all frequencies identified so far and with their linear combinations was performed .",
    "all frequencies were optimized anew .",
    "the new fit was subtracted from original time - series data and residuals were searched for additional periodicities again .",
    "the process was repeated until no new frequencies appeared . at this stage , we performed data clipping , by rejecting all measurements deviating from the fit by more than 5@xmath10 , where @xmath10 is the dispersion of residuals . after removing deviating datapoints ,",
    "the entire frequency analysis was repeated .    the second method , also based on the consecutive prewhitenings , differed by treatment of the residua .",
    "we started from the anova periodogram ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 ) of the raw light curve and searched it for the peak frequency .",
    "then the light curve was prewihtened with the frequency just identified .",
    "depending on the amplitudes we removed up to 15 harmonics of the frequency from the the _ prewhitened data _ of the previous stage .",
    "next we recomputed the anova periodogram for the residuals and the whole procedure was repeated recursively till no feature exceeded anova value of 15 .",
    "it is worth to note that both methods produce , within errors , the same results .",
    "the only discrepancies appeared when a real period and its alias have similar height and one method preferred one peak and the second the other one . in this case",
    "we have chosen the fit with smaller formal error .",
    "we detected secondary periodicities close to the primary pulsation frequency in 17 out of 70 fundamental mode pulsators ( rrab or rr0 stars ) and in 31 out of 81 first overtone pulsators ( rrc or rr1 stars ) .",
    "the new frequencies are well - resolved within our dataset and do not result from secular period variability .",
    "the derived period ratios are incompatible with those of the radial modes .",
    "consequently , the newly detected secondary frequencies must correspond to nonradial modes of oscillations .",
    "the beating between these nonradial modes and the primary radial pulsation leads to a slow modulation of the observed light curve , a phenomenon known as the blazhko effect .    in rrab variables",
    "two nonradial modes were detected in most cases .",
    "together with the primary peak , they form an equally spaced triplet of frequencies , centered on the primary peak . following alcock et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) we call such stars rr0-bl variables . in 3 rrab stars only one nonradial mode is present ( rr0-@xmath11 variables ) .",
    "finally , an even more complicated pattern was detected in variable v11 . in this object",
    "we found an equidistant triplet plus an additional peak on the high frequency side of the primary peak .",
    "in fig.1 we display typical examples of different frequency patterns encountered in the rrab variables . for comparison ,",
    "we show a true monoperiodic star in the top panel of the plot .    in rrc variables",
    "usually only one nonradial mode was detected ( rr1-@xmath11 stars ) .",
    "equidistant triplets were found only in 4 variables ( rr1-bl stars ) .",
    "however , more complicated patterns are seen in rrc stars much more frequently than in the rrab stars . in 6 variables we detected _",
    "nonequidistant _ triplets of modes . in other 4 rrc stars",
    ", even richer frequency patterns with up to 7 nonradial modes were found .",
    "our findings are summarized in tables1 and 2 . in @xmath0",
    "cen fundamental mode rr  lyrae stars the incidence rate of nonradial modes is @xmath12% .",
    "this is twice the rate observed in the lmc , but identical to the rate in the galactic bulge . for @xmath0  cen overtone rr  lyrae stars the incidence rate of nonradial modes is @xmath13% , which is exceptionally high .",
    "this is by far the highest rate among all studied rrc populations , being 3 times higher than in the bulge and 4 times higher than in the lmc .",
    "table 1 : incidence rates of nonradial modes in rrab stars in lmc , galactic bulge and @xmath0 cen .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     rr  lyrae stars pulsating in the first and second overtone ( fo / so variables ) have been previously discovered in the lmc ( alcock et  al .",
    ". however , soszyski et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) have noticed , that all these stars are about 1mag brighter than typical rr  lyrae stars in the lmc and suggested that they might belong to short - period double mode cepheids .",
    "in contrast , the two fo / so double mode pulsators discovered in @xmath0  cen belong to the rr  lyrae population of the cluster without any doubt .    in one object , v168",
    ", we discovered triple mode pulsations .",
    "this star varies with @xmath14day , @xmath15day and @xmath16day .",
    "the resulting period ratios are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these ratios indicate that v168 pulsates in the fundamental mode and the first two radial overtones ( fu / fo / so pulsator ) . the value of @xmath19 is too large for rr  lyrae stars , but it is rather typical for high amplitude @xmath4  scuti stars ( hads ) , especially for those with longest periods ( poretti et  al .",
    "we note in passing , that period ratios of v168 are very similar to ratios observed in two other triple mode hads , v829  aql ( handler et  al .",
    "1998 ) and v823  cas ( jurcsik et  al . 2006 ) .",
