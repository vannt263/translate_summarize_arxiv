    "the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the theoretical description of the inclusive production of single heavy - flavored hadrons , combining the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) and zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - fvns ) , which are valid in complementary kinematic regions , in a unified approach that enjoys the virtues of both schemes and , at the same time , is bare of their flaws .",
    "specifically , it resums large logarithms by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution of non - perturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , guarantees the universality of the latter as in the zm - vfns , and simultaneously retains the mass - dependent terms of the ffns without additional theoretical assumptions .",

    "these determinations have recently been updated and improved @xcite by also including kekb and cesr @xcite data , switching to the gm - vfns , and also incorporating hadron - mass corrections .",
