    "nasa s _ kepler _  mission has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems , their multiplicity , and occurrence rate @xcite .",
    "most of the candidates have radii between @xmath2 to neptune radius ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "several trends , not all a - priori expected , have emerged among this new class of small ( presumably low - mass ) planet population .",
    "one of the most prominent trends is the existence of extremely compact , well aligned , short period multi - transiting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another trend is that although the spacings between planet pairs among most kpcs seems random , there is a clear overabundance of pairs just wide of major mmrs including @xmath0 , and @xmath4 , ( figure  [ fig : obs ] ) and a lack of planet pairs just inside of these resonances @xcite .",
    "this feature in the period - ratio distribution in the kpcs is in drastic contrast to that observed in the planet populations discovered via rv surveys @xcite which preferentially find much higher mass planets , and shows a clear peak very near the @xmath0 mmr .",
    "tests for the statistical significance of this apparent overabundance indicate a clear deficit of planet pairs interior to @xmath0 and an overabundance near period ratio of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "smooth gas - disk driven convergent migration is expected to trap planets into mmrs resulting in period ratios that are very close to the exact integer ratios , and this is thought to be responsible for the giant planet mmr pairs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the orbital period ratios of a pair of planets near the @xmath6 mmr usually have small ( @xmath7 ) offsets from the exact integer ratios , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the orbital period of the @xmath10 planet ( e.g. , @xmath11 for @xmath0 mmr ) .",
    "planet - planet scattering , on the other hand , brings large changes to the orbits of the planet pairs initially trapped into a mmr and likely dramatically increases the relative inclinations of these orbits making multi - transiting configuration impossible ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the process responsible for the observed large ( @xmath12 ) positive @xmath13 distribution must not be as smooth as gas - disk migration and also not as strong as planet - planet scattering .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this feature must be fairly common during planetary system formation , as evidenced by the high fraction of near - resonance kpc pairs exhibiting this feature .",
    "this process must also be significantly more powerful for low - mass planets compared to the giants where this feature has not been observed .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain this feature , .",
    "for example , resonance repulsion in presence of tidal damping @xcite creates positive @xmath13 , but predicts values that are at least an order of magnitude too small suggesting additional dissipative processes are at play @xcite . in situ growth of planets via planetesimal accretion @xcite assumes idealized and likely unphysical initial conditions since planetesimal accretion naturally results in changes in the semi major axis ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "gas disk interactions in presence of turbulence may result in positive @xmath13 , but the results are strongly dependent on the strength of such turbulence which is largely uncertain and highly variable .",
    "this leads us to search for a mechanism that can easily create asymmetric shifts in periods from exact mmrs , that is expected to be ubiquitous within the core - accretion paradigm of planet formation , and that is not overly sensitive on the details of the initial conditions .",
    "we propose that gas - disk driven migration traps some planet pairs in mmr with low @xmath13 , as expected from conventional theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after gas dispersal , these planets interact with planetesimals from a residual disk , expected to be present from the core - accretion paradigm of planet formation .",
    "these interactions are stochastic , but of much weaker strength than planet - planet scattering .",
    "planetesimal driven migration ( in presence or absence of a gas disk ) is a well studied process and has been long identified as an important ingredient in understanding the formation and evolution of planets , especially , in the context of the outer solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , numerical results suggest that planetesimal disk scattering can significantly alter @xmath13 for some specific _ kepler _",
    "systems @xcite .",
    "we systematically study the effects of planetesimal disk interactions on resonant planet pairs .",
    "in particular , we focus on the @xmath0 mmr in this study since the difference in the period ratio distribution between low - mass planets and giant planets is the most dramatic near this mmr . in  [ s : modeling ] we describe our numerical setup , the explored parameter space , and explain the choices of our initial conditions . in  [ s : results ] we describe our key results . finally , we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process and explain implications that can be observationally tested in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] .",
    "a fully realistic numerical model of systems containing two planets trapped in a mmr emerging from a full protoplanetary disk with planets , planetesimals , and gas is impractical and beyond the scope of this study .",
    "instead , we use pure @xmath15-body models with initial conditions generated to mimic the expected properties of a system emerging from a dissipative gas disk . in order to create reasonable initial conditions for the planet and planetesimal orbits",
    "we adopt a 3-stage algorithm . in stage  1",
    "we create orbital properties for planet pairs in @xmath0 mmr by migrating the outer planet inwards (  [ s : stage1 ] ) . in stage  2",
    "we create initial planetesimal disk properties that are dynamically consistent with the resonant planet pair properties (  [ s : stage2 ] ) .",
    "these two steps create initial conditions for the final and main stage of models including two resonant planets and a dynamically active planetesimals disk ( stage  3 ;  [ s : stage3 ] ) .",
    "we test whether late stage ( after gas disk is dispersed ) interactions between the resonant planets and a residual planetesimal disk can create large positive offsets from initial integer ratio of periods expected of the mmr .",
    "we use the hybrid integrator of mercury6.2 @xcite for all stages of our simulations .",
    "we use a planetary density of @xmath16 , typical of _ kepler _ s multi - planet systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to calculate the planet sizes for all our simulations .",
    "the planetesimal density is chosen to be @xmath17 .",
    "below we describe the detailed numerical treatments for each stage of our simulations .      in this stage",
    "our initial properties consist of two planets of masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( indices are counted from inside out ) .",
    "the initial semimajor axis for the inner planet is @xmath21 .",
    "initial semimajor axis of the outer planet @xmath22 is chosen to be @xmath23 outside the exact period ratio of @xmath24 .",
    "initially both orbits are circular .",
    "orbital planes of the two planets are aligned initially .",
    "we choose other orbital phase angles uniformly from their full ranges .",
    "the two planets are evolved using the hybrid integrator .",
    "we mimic gas disk damping and convergent migration by applying a forced migration using @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the outer planet @xcite .",
    "the outer planet moves in smoothly and the two orbits get trapped into @xmath0 mmr at @xmath27 .",
    "the trapped planets move further inwards together for another @xmath28 , when the @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms are switched off .",
    "we follow the evolution of the resonant planets till @xmath31 .",
    "the left panels in figure  [ fig : evolution ] show an example of the evolution of the planetary orbital properties in stage  1 .",
    "initially the resonant angles circulate and the planets are not in resonance .",
    "resonant angles start liberating as the planets are trapped into @xmath0 mmr .",
    "the value of @xmath13 steadily decreases and reaches a small value @xmath32 .",
    "at the end of stage  1  we note the orbital properties of the planet pair and thus initial orbital properties for a resonant planet pair are created .",
    "we first choose a disk described by a simple power - law of the form @xmath33 .",
    "we ascertain that the disk edges are sufficiently far from the planets to avoid unpredictable edge effects by setting the inner disk edge at @xmath34 interior to the @xmath14 value for @xmath35 period ratio with the inner planet .",
    "similarly , we set the outer edge of the disk at @xmath34 exterior to the @xmath14 value for the @xmath36 period ratio with the outer planet orbit .",
    "the planetesimal positions are selected consistent with the power - law profile .",
    "the planetesimal eccentricities ( @xmath37 ) are drawn uniformly in the range @xmath38 to @xmath7 .",
    "the initial orbital inclinations are drawn randomly to vary between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "other orbital phase angles for the planetesimals are chosen randomly in their full ranges .    in a real system , while a gas disk is present , it can damp dynamical excitations in the planetesimal orbits caused by the resonant planets .",
    "however , planetesimal orbits that are unstable on very short timescales will still be disrupted via collisions and scattering due to strong gravitational interactions with the planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the system emerges out of the gas disk , the planetesimal disk will not remain a pure power - law , but will have features such as a decrease in density near the planets that perturb the initial power - law , resonance features , and a larger dispersion in @xmath37 .",
    "we model the planetary perturbations to the planetesimal disk surface density profiles in the following way .",
    "we collect final orbital properties of the resonant planet pairs created in stage  1 .",
    "we evolve these planets with a swath of planetesimals with properties obtained using a particular value of @xmath41 and disk edges as described above for @xmath42 . at this stage",
    "we treat all planetesimals as test particles , so the planets can dynamically alter the planetesimal orbits , but the planetesimals can not change planet properties .",
    "after @xmath43 we stop the integrations and collect orbital properties of the surviving planetesimals .",
    "we create a large database of @xmath44 surviving planetesimal orbits for each @xmath41 and each combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the database will not include planetesimals on orbits that rapidly become unstable , for example , via physical collisions with the planets .",
    "however , if planetesimals can survive in specific orbital configurations , such as @xmath45 resonance , horse - shoe or tadpole orbits , then such orbits will be naturally populated among the orbital database of surviving planetesimals .",
    "hence , at the end of stage  2 , a database of planetesimal orbits is created that is dynamically consistent for each combination of resonant planet pair mass and initial planetesimal disk surface density profile ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "we expect that shortly before gas disk dispersal @xmath37-damping may not be efficient and eccentricities of planetesimal orbits near the planets will likely grow @xcite .",
    "therefore , during stage  2  we do not apply any forced damping . as a result ,",
    "planetesimal eccentricities grow freely via encounters with the planets .",
    "the exact values depend on the details of the initial planet and planetesimal disk properties .",
    "we find that the median @xmath37 for all planetesimal orbits at the end of stage  2  is @xmath46 .",
    "for planetesimal orbits within @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the hill radius of the @xmath10 planet ) , a region within which almost all planetesimals will have a strong encounter with the planets during stage  3 , the median @xmath37 is a little higher @xmath50 .",
    "here the error bars denote the standard deviation in the @xmath37-distributions .",
    "our simulations do not explicitly include a gas disk .",
    "rather , they are designed to imitate the expected effects of a gas disk , namely , removal and alterations of only those orbits that are unstable on short timescales ( @xmath51 is our choice ) , and preservation of orbits that are not unstable on these short timescales .",
    "the integration stopping time of @xmath42 in stage  2  is somewhat arbitrary since it is hard to predict the stabilizing effect of the gas disk and exactly which planetesimals will be unstable even while the gas is present .",
    "our choice of @xmath42 results in removing planetesimal orbits unless they are stable for @xmath52 orbits of the inner planets .",
    "hence , further interactions at orbital timescales are not expected .",
    "integrating longer would not change the overall qualitative results as long as there are enough planetesimals in the disk to interact with the planets at the end of this stage .",
    "this is the main stage of our study where simulations follow the evolution of planet pairs in resonance embedded in a dynamically consistent planetesimal disk .",
    "we randomly choose @xmath53 planetesimal orbits from the orbital databases we create in stage  2   for each combination of a resonant planet pair and initial power - law exponent @xmath41 .",
    "we extract the orbital properties for the resonant planet pair at the end of stage  2 .",
    "we evolve the planets and planetesimals together .",
    "now , the planetesimals are treated as pseudo - test particles , such that planetesimals interact with the planets , but they do not interact between themselves .",
    "this approximation reduces the computational cost and is not expected to change our results significantly . all planetesimals are of equal mass in each simulated model .",
    "the mass of each planetesimal is set to achieve the desired ratio between the total planetesimal disk mass ( @xmath54 ) and the total planet mass @xmath55 .",
    "we stop our integrations at @xmath56 .",
    "we have tested that longer integrations and integrations with larger @xmath57 ( at fixed @xmath54 ) do not alter the results in a statistically significant way . at the end of the integrations we retrieve the orbital properties of the planets and all planetesimals .",
    "we study the evolution of orbital properties of the initially resonant planets including @xmath13 and the resonant angles .",
    "we restrict our study to the @xmath0 mmr since @xmath13-values for _ kepler _  systems show the strongest difference from rv - discovered systems near period ratio of @xmath58 , primarily due to a large number of rv - discovered giant planet pairs near a period ratio of @xmath58 .",
    "we choose the planet masses in the following way .",
    "the more massive planet s mass is set to @xmath59 .",
    "the mass of the other planet , is determined using a grid of @xmath60 values .",
    "we vary @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "we vary the disk density profile given by @xmath69 by choosing @xmath41 in a large range between @xmath70 to @xmath71 using a grid step - size of @xmath72 . for each combination of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and",
    "@xmath41 we vary @xmath73 between @xmath74 to @xmath75 with a grid step - size of @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , we include @xmath76 . to address the inherent statistical fluctuations we simulate @xmath77 realizations for each choice of @xmath60 , @xmath41 , and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , our results are based on a large ensemble ( @xmath78 simulations in stage  3 , each with two planets trapped in @xmath0 mmr and @xmath79 pseudo - test particles ) of models .",
    "the choice of @xmath57 in stage  3  is somewhat arbitrary and guided by the following considerations . in this study",
    "we will test whether the cumulative effect of many small perturbations from several planetesimals can eventually disrupt the @xmath0 resonance between a pair of planetary orbits , and leave them close to the initial period commensurability with @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "hence , it is essential to ensure that the perturbation caused by an individual planet - planetesimal interaction is sufficiently small and can not disrupt the resonance .",
    "for a given @xmath73 the higher the @xmath57 , the smoother the evolution . however , the computational cost scales as @xmath82 for the pseudo test - particles . combined with the requirement of small timesteps ( we use @xmath83 )",
    "to increase accuracy and a sufficiently long integration time , making @xmath57 very large is computationally impractical .",
    "fortunately , analytical considerations from resonance theory can guide us to determine a sufficient value of @xmath57 while keeping the computational costs reasonable .",
    "we require that the maximum possible fractional change @xmath84 to a planet s orbit caused by dynamical interaction with a single planetesimal is lower than the resonance width @xmath85 of the mmr .",
    "the libration width @xmath86 for @xmath0 mmr in the restricted three - body case is @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the planet mass and the star mass , respectively @xcite .",
    "the maximum change in @xmath84 from a single planet - planetesimal interaction is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass of the planetesimal .",
    "hence , our requirement is satisfied if @xmath92 using our model assumptions of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and for equal mass planetesimals , the above condition is equivalent to @xmath95 .",
    "numerical tests of stage  3  simulations using varying @xmath57 verify that any @xmath96 gives statistically indistinguishable results , and @xmath97 makes the evolution fairly smooth .",
    "hence , the choice of @xmath98 in our models is adequately high for this study . using @xmath53 and by treating them as pseudo - test particles , simulations in stage  3  took a total of @xmath99 cpu hours to complete .",
    "scattering and accretion of the planetesimals perturb the planetary orbits stochastically ( see figure  [ fig : evolution ] , right panels for an example ) .",
    "initially , @xmath13 changes chaotically due to individual planet - planetesimal interactions .",
    "no single interaction is strong enough to break the resonance .",
    "these interactions damp the eccentricities of both planets .",
    "after sufficiently large number of interactions the overall perturbations disrupt the resonance indicated by recirculation of the resonance angles .",
    "once the resonance is disrupted , further interactions steadily increase @xmath13 until there are insufficient planetesimals left in the disk that can interact with the planets ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "then @xmath13 reaches a steady value , @xmath100 in this example ( figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) .    for a representative set of our models ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath38 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , @xmath75 , @xmath62 ) we turn on extensive logging to track close encounters , defined as planetesimals coming within @xmath75 hill radius ( @xmath105 ) of a planet .",
    "outcomes of each planet - planetesimal close encounter depends on the details of the initial conditions including @xmath60 and @xmath41 ( figure  [ fig : cewhich ] ) . for",
    "our choice of planet properties ( mass and density ) , planetesimals from a large range in initial positions ( @xmath106 ) come within @xmath107 of both planets .",
    "planetesimals that come within @xmath107 of either the inner or the outer planet had @xmath108 predominantly inside of the inner planet or outside of the outer planet .",
    "the fraction of all planetesimal orbits at the beginning of stage  3  that come within @xmath107 of a planet varies widely depending on @xmath60 and @xmath41 .",
    "for example , @xmath109 of all planetesimals come within @xmath107 of a planet during the stage  3  evolution for one model with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath101 , whereas , this fraction is @xmath112 for another model with @xmath104 , @xmath102 and @xmath101 .",
    "the fraction of planetesimals taking part in close encounters also vary by large fractions from model to model with the same initial @xmath60 , @xmath41 , and @xmath73 but different simply by random realization of the initial conditions of planetesimals orbits ( e.g. , @xmath113 and @xmath114 between two models with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath101 ) .",
    "the ratio of the number of planetesimals that has at least one close encounter with the planets and the number of planetesimals that physically collide with one of the planets also can vary widely ( @xmath115 for one of our models with @xmath110 , @xmath102 , @xmath101 , and @xmath116 for @xmath117 , @xmath102 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "the fraction of accreted planetesimals that had close encounters with the planets prior to accretion varies stochastically between realizations with the same initial values for @xmath60 , @xmath41 , and @xmath73 .",
    "for example , two different models both with @xmath110 , @xmath102 and @xmath101 show @xmath118 and @xmath119 for this quantity .",
    "planetesimals that finally collide with one of the planets , often had multiple close encounters with both planets prior to accretion . among models with extensive logging of this information",
    "we find that the ratio of the number of accreted planetesimals that had multiple close encounters with both planets before they were finally accreted and the number of all accreted planetesimals is typically large and varies between @xmath120 ( for a model with @xmath104 , @xmath102 , @xmath101 ) to @xmath121 ( for a model with @xmath110 , @xmath102 , @xmath101 ) .    the quantitative results including when the resonance is broken and the final value of @xmath13 vary from model to model .",
    "however , the qualitative nature of the evolution for the planetary orbits remains the same for all @xmath60 , @xmath41 , and @xmath73 we have considered . for all models with a sufficiently massive initial planetesimal disk ( @xmath122 ) the resonance is typically broken and @xmath13 grows to positive values for all @xmath41 ( figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the observed asymmetry in the @xmath13-distribution for near - resonance planet pairs in the _ kepler _  data , namely , an overabundance of planet pairs just wide of the @xmath0 and @xmath123 mmrs and a dearth of systems narrow of them , can be a natural outcome of interactions between resonant planet pairs and planetesimals from a planetesimal disk .",
    "this basic outcome is insensitive to the details of the values for @xmath41 , @xmath60 , and @xmath73 as long as @xmath73 is sufficiently high .    for a given @xmath73 ,",
    "disks with flatter profiles contain a larger number of planetesimals close to the planetary orbits compared to steeper profiles because of our numerical setup that ensures that the disk edges are always sufficiently far from the planetary orbits (  [ s : stage2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the final @xmath13 distribution depends on @xmath41 ( figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) , primarily because @xmath41 affects the number of planetesimals that can interact with the planets .",
    "a flatter disk profile ( @xmath124 ) tends to create larger @xmath13 values overall .",
    "the extreme positive and negative @xmath41 models result in very similar distributions for the final @xmath13 values .",
    "the migration directions for individual planets do depend on the details of these initial properties ( figure  [ fig : migdir ] ) .",
    "we first focus on systems where the resonance is broken and the final @xmath13 has grown significantly ( @xmath125 ) . except for a few cases with @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    "the inner planet always migrates inwards . for @xmath128 , for all @xmath41",
    ", the outer planet also moves inwards but at a smaller rate compared to the inner planet such that the orbits diverge and @xmath13 values grow .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath126 the outer planet migrates outwards for all @xmath41 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "both outcomes are possible depending on @xmath41 . if @xmath129 , then planetary orbits diverge via inner planet moving in and outer planet moving out .",
    "otherwise both planets move in . for the cases where @xmath13 stays small ( e.g. , when the resonance is not broken as a result of the planet - planetesimal interactions )",
    ", @xmath13 can have both positive and negative values and both planets may move slightly in or out .",
    "we also find that for any given @xmath41 the dispersion in the growth of @xmath13 is typically higher if @xmath128 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdovermp ] shows the dependence of the final @xmath13 on @xmath73 .",
    "the quartiles ( 25% , 50% , and 75% ) for the final @xmath13 distributions increase almost linearly with increasing @xmath73 ( top - left ) . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the resonance is typically not disrupted and @xmath13 remains small ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the critical value for @xmath73 to break the @xmath0 resonance and drive up @xmath13 depends on @xmath41 because the number of planetesimals close enough to interact with the planets depends on @xmath41 .",
    "for example , for models with @xmath132 all quartiles for the @xmath13-distribution remains small for @xmath133 .",
    "the slope of the increase of the quartiles with respect to @xmath73 also stays relatively low . for another steep disk profile @xmath134",
    "the results are quite similar , and show only a small difference in the exact value of the critical @xmath73 for resonance disruption and a modest increase of the slope .",
    "in contrast , for a flat disk profile @xmath135 we find that the critical @xmath73 value is reduced significantly and the quartiles of the @xmath13 distribution show a much steeper slope .",
    "these differences largely originate from the difference in the number of planetesimals close enough to interact with the planet pairs depending on @xmath41 .",
    "indeed figure  [ fig : cewhich ] shows that flat ( @xmath135 ) disk profiles result in many more planet - planetesimal close encounters compared to steeper profiles ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) .",
    "for the steeper disk profiles a large number of planetesimals do not suffer any strong interactions with the planets simply because they are too far from the planets .",
    "thus , the critical value for @xmath73 remains dependent , on the initial power law profile and the locations of the disk edges relative to the planetary orbits .",
    "while @xmath73 provides important information for this process such as how much total angular momentum or energy must be stored in the planetesimal orbits ( for a given choice of planetesimal boundaries and @xmath41 ) , the quantitative results such as how many planetesimals take part in strong interaction with the planets depend on the choices of the disk profile and the disk edges .",
    "for example , if the planetesimal disk spans a smaller region , same degree of planet - planetesimal interactions may be achieved from a lower @xmath73 .",
    "a less ambiguous and more dynamically informative quantity is the total mass of planetesimals that had strong interactions with the planets ( @xmath137 ) .    as a proxy to strong interactions",
    "we calculate the total mass of planetesimals accreted by the planets ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "using the representative models with extensive logging of all close encounters ( figure  [ fig : cewhich ] ) we find that @xmath138 ( equivalently number of collisions ) is highly correlated with @xmath137 .",
    "the pearson s correlation coefficient between @xmath138 and @xmath137 is @xmath139 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath138 should serve as a good tracer of the total mass of dynamically important planetesimals .",
    "alternatively , several other quantities including the total number of planet - planetesimal strong encounters , or total number of planetesimals within regions close to either planets could have been used .",
    "however , using @xmath138 as a tracer of the mass of dynamically important planetesimals gives us two advantages . tracking @xmath138 does not require extensive logging of close encounters which slows these simulations significantly .",
    "in addition , physical collisions may lead to observable differences in atmospheric properties and may create strange mass - radius relations for these planets , which make @xmath138 a very interesting quantity .    the quartiles for the final @xmath13-distributions increase almost linearly with increasing @xmath140 , similar to what we see in the case of @xmath73 ( figure  [ fig : mcollovermp ] ) . however , we find that the slopes for the quartiles of @xmath13 distributions with respect to @xmath140 do not vary as much with changing @xmath41 as was seen for @xmath73 .",
    "several key factors related to the inherent nature of this process are apparent from the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath140 . each planet - planetesimal interaction results in a small change in @xmath14 , @xmath141 , the resonance width .",
    "the qualitative behavior of each random interaction between a planetesimal and one of the planets is similar to a random walk ( bottom right panel , figure 1 ) with step size @xmath142 . in this picture ,",
    "higher @xmath140 means larger number of steps .",
    "if @xmath140 is not sufficiently high , these random steps are unlikely to drive the planets out of resonance . for a sufficiently large @xmath140",
    ", the cumulative effect of several interactions may result in a overall change @xmath143 disrupting the resonance .",
    "afterwards , planets migrate further apart since they are able to interact with more planetesimals near their new positions .",
    "the inherent stochastic nature of this process is manifested by the fact that for any given @xmath140 , @xmath13 can attain a range of final values . even when @xmath140 is sufficiently high , the resonance may not be disrupted in a small number of systems .",
    "nevertheless , increase in @xmath140 increases the probability of disruption of resonance and growth of @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the threshold for resonance disruption and growth of @xmath13 is @xmath144 , for our choice of planet masses and densities which are guided by typical values observed of the _ kepler _  systems (  [ s : modeling ] ) .",
    "if the total mass of accreted planetesimals is lower than this critical value , then there is little chance for growth of @xmath13 .",
    "such threshold - like behavior naturally explains why the positive @xmath145@xmath81 are seen only among much smaller , hence less massive _ kepler _  systems . the total mass in planetesimals after gas dispersal is seldom sufficient to disrupt resonances between the more massive rv - discovered planets .",
    "even if giant and small planets , both get trapped in the same mmrs during the gas - disk dominated evolution , planetesimal interactions produce significant @xmath146 only for the low - mass planets .    due to the stochastic nature of this process ,",
    "sometimes the resonance is not disrupted even if @xmath73 or @xmath140 are sufficiently high . in these cases",
    "@xmath13 values remain small @xmath131 . moreover , in such cases",
    ", planet pairs can attain both positive and negative @xmath13 values .",
    "negative @xmath13 values are always small @xmath147 ( figure  [ fig : mcollovermp ] ) and are only seen in systems where the initial resonance is not disrupted .    in each model",
    "we choose a fixed density for the planets .",
    "_ kepler _  data , however , show that planets of very similar sizes can have widely varying densities @xcite . using a few representative models we test whether the extent of divergence of planetary orbits via planet - planetesimal interactions depend on the planetary densities .",
    "we find that for the full range in densities ( point mass to @xmath148 ) planetary orbits diverge from the initial resonant configuration and @xmath13 can attain large ( @xmath149 ) positive values .",
    "for example , multiple realizations of models with @xmath110 , @xmath102 , and @xmath101 show final @xmath13 values ranging between @xmath150 to @xmath151 for the point - mass planets , @xmath152 to @xmath153 for @xmath154 , and @xmath155 to @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "hence , we conclude that growth of @xmath13 via planetesimal scattering should not critically depend on the choice of planetary densities .",
    "the extent of planetesimal driven migration may depend on the initial @xmath37 of the planet orbits and the rms @xmath37 of planetesimals in stage  3   (  [ s : stage2],[s : stage3 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "effects of the @xmath37-distribution in planetesimal orbits on the resonant planets migration may be interesting to explore in a future study .",
    "our results indicate that the near - resonant planet pairs in the kepler data can provide hitherto unprecedented constraints on the structure and mass of the exo - planetesimal disks as the system emerges from the gas disk . for many systems with a pair of near - resonant planets , planet masses",
    "can be measured using analysis of transit time variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational constraints on the planet masses and @xmath13 for a particular system can lead to constraints on the total mass and the surface density profile of the planetesimal disk when the gas dissipates , assuming that the @xmath13 is generated via planet - planetesimal - disk interactions using , e.g. , figure  [ fig:2dfig ] .",
    "for example , to create the observed @xmath158 for the _ kepler_-18bc system , @xmath159 is required for a reasonable range @xmath160 .",
    "disks with steeper density profiles show a smaller range in @xmath140 to produce the same observed @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig:2dfig ] ) compared to flatter disk profiles .",
    "in this study we propose a mechanism that can naturally change orbits of planet pairs initially trapped in a mmr and create @xmath145@xmath81 ( figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) , typical of the observed kpc pairs near major mmrs @xcite .",
    "planetary systems with several planets accompanied by a large number of planetesimals are thought to form naturally via the core accretion paradigm of planet formation .",
    "planetesimal disks are also seen in the solar system .",
    "planet formation theories also predict trapping of planet pairs via smooth gas - disk driven migration .",
    "hence , our adopted initial setup of resonant planet pairs close to planetesimal disks after gas dispersal is expected to be common based on the predictions of standard planet formation theories .",
    "we find that interactions between resonant planet pairs and planetesimals in a planetesimal disk naturally creates large positive @xmath13 if the total mass of accreted planetesimals is sufficiently high ( figure  [ fig : mcollovermp ] ) .",
    "these interactions also naturally produce the observed asymmetry in the @xmath13 distribution in the _ kepler _  systems for large ranges in @xmath41 ( figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "the existence of a critical value of @xmath140 ( figure  [ fig : mcollovermp ] ) for resonance disruption and growth of @xmath13 also explains why this asymmetry is only observed in _",
    "systems that are typically less massive compared to the rv - discovered systems .",
    "we conducted pure @xmath15-body integrations using initial conditions generated to mimic systems that emerged from a dissipative gas disk .",
    "to more rigorously ascertain the initial conditions for resonant planet pairs and residual planetesimal disks as they emerge out of a gas disk together , one would need to include gas , planetesimals and planets in a self consistent model .",
    "this is extremely challenging and beyond the scope of our study .",
    "however , since the basic result of @xmath13-growth seems to be common for such a wide range of @xmath41 ( even extreme positive values ) , these conclusions may not be sensitive to the details of the properties of the planetesimals disk .",
    "the only way to avoid our proposed mechanism would be if resonant planet pairs never are near significantly massive planetesimals disks when disk disperses .",
    "if indeed planet - planetesimals interactions are responsible for the observed asymmetric distribution of @xmath13 for near resonant planet pairs in the _ kepler _  data , then the high frequency of large-@xmath13 , near - resonant _ kepler _  systems indicates that planet - planetesimal interactions after gas - disk dissipation is an important evolutionary stage for all small planets independent of their proximity to a resonance .",
    "collisions of planetesimals of total mass @xmath161 few percent of the planet mass is often needed for the observed high values of @xmath13 for _ kepler_-discovered near - resonance planet pairs .",
    "many small _ kepler _  planets are measured to have surprisingly low @xmath162 , which makes collisions even more efficient for these planets .",
    "these collisions may affect the planets atmospheric properties and compositions especially for the low - mass atmospheres believed to be typical for small planets @xcite .",
    "such accretions could also potentially create an anomalous mass - radius relationship for near - resonant low - mass planets .",
    "therefore , we encourage detailed modeling of the effects of planetesimal collisions on the atmospheric properties of these planets , especially for pairs with large observed @xmath13 values .",
