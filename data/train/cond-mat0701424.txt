    "understanding the signatures of many - body interactions in the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors is an important fundamental problem with implications to all - optical and electro - optical device applications.@xcite  the linear response to a weak optical field is well described by a model of non - interacting quasiparticles",
    ".  however , residual interactions , not accounted for by these quasiparticles , can considerably affect the nonlinear response .",
    "similar to frenkel excitons in molecular crystals and aggregates,@xcite  coulomb correlations among quasiparticles can dominate the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors , in marked contrast to the behavior of atomic systems.@xcite     the coherent ultrafast response and many - body correlations in semiconductor heterostructures have been studied extensively in the past two decades .",
    "@xcite  due to  various dephasing and relaxation mechanisms , the coherent response usually persists only on the tens of picosecond time scale .",
    "optical spectra such as the linear absorption , pump - probe and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) are commonly displayed as a function of a single ( time or frequency ) variable , and hence provide a one - dimensional ( 1d ) projection of the microscopic information .",
    "1d spectra are hard to interpret in systems with many congested energy levels .",
    "the spectroscopic signatures of complex many - body dynamics projected on a 1d spectral plot strongly overlap and may not be easily identified .",
    "for example , when 1d techniques are employed in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) , it is difficult to pinpoint the signatures of two - excitons due to the small ( 1 to 2 mev ) two - exciton interaction energies , i.e. , bound two - exciton binding energy and unbound two - exciton scattering energy.@xcite  two - exciton effects can be easily masked by homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening .",
    "when both light - hole ( lh )  and heavy - hole ( hh ) excitons and their interactions are taken into account , the situation becomes even more complicated since there are different types of two - excitons such as lh , hh and mixed two - excitons.@xcite  even in ii - vi semiconductor qws , where the two - exciton interaction energies are much larger , ( from several to several tens of mev),@xcite it is still hard to resolve them .",
    "multi - dimensional spectroscopy@xcite in which the optical response is recorded and displayed versus several arguments , can overcome these limitations by separating the signatures of different pathways of the density matrix , known as liouville space pathways.@xcite  because different pathways are usually connected with specific couplings , one can resolve different coherences and many - body interactions by focusing on different peaks in multi - dimensional correlation plots .",
    "optical and infrared 2d correlation spectroscopy ( 2dcs ) is a femtosecond analogue of multi - dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite that has been shown to be very powerful for probing the structure and dynamics in chemical and biological systems.@xcite  these techniques can reveal the coupling strength of elementary excitation through _ cross - peaks_.  after several attempts@xcite to go beyond 1d techniques , the first experimental implementation of 2dcs to investigate the many - body coulomb interactions among lh  and heavy - hole hh excitons in semiconductors has been reported recently.@xcite     in this work , we present the basic principles@xcite of 2dcs in semiconductor qws and show how it can be used to study the couplings among lh and hh  excitons in a gaas single quantum well .  the same methodology previously applied to frenkel excitons ( hard - core bosons ) in molecular aggregates or anharmonic vibrations ( soft - core bosons ) in proteins@xcite can be extended to wannier excitons.@xcite  in section ii , we survey the possible third - order 2d techniques of excitons .",
    "the double - sided feynman diagrams and the corresponding sum - over - states expressions for 2dcs in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells are presented in section iii .",
    "these guide the analysis of the numerical calculations presented in later sections .  in section iv",
    ", we present the multiband hamiltonian and the nonlinear exciton equations used for the numerical calculation of the 2dcs signals .",

    "impulsive 2dcs signals generated by well - separated femtosecond pulses may be calculated using sum - over - states expressions which provide insights into the origin of various peaks associated with different coherences and many - body interactions .",
    "these expressions will be used in the following sections to analyze the 2d signals obtained by numerical solution of equations of motion with finite - envelope pulses .",
