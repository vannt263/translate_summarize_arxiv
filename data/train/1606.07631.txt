    "the primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , which might be formed in the early radiation dominated universe , have attracted scientists for more than 40 years and are recently refocused on more and more .",
    "theoretically they can be formed by the gravitational collapse of the hubble patch if the mean energy density in that patch is higher by @xmath0 than its surroundings  @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations of pbhs is dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "since they behave as a matter component , they can be a main component of dm without introducing other elementary particles .",
    "however pbhs are still not detected by any observation , and their abundance is constrained  @xcite , except in a mass window of @xmath1 , where pbhs can still account for all dark matter . some recent attempts to close this window relied on assumptions that are difficult to justify .",
    "for example , the existence of neutron stars in globular clusters could help constrain the remaining window , if the density of dark matter exceeded the average by more than two orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "however , observations of globular clusters show no evidence of significant dark matter content in such systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that tidal deformation of a neutron star could lead to an efficient energy dissipation and capture of a black hole , leading to stronger constraints  @xcite , but such energy losses are uncertain , and they are likely to be suppressed for realistic parameters and velocities in excess of the speed of sound  @xcite , so that no new constraints can be derived , and the window for pbh dark matter remains open .    as one of the series of the pbh production works , several authors have studied the pbh formation in the double inflation in the supergravity frame work  @xcite . following this stream ,",
    "we propose a novel new inflation model as the second phase of the double inflation , where pbhs can be produced on mass @xmath2 enough to constitute the bulk of dm in this paper .",
    "parity is broken and lsp is not stable , and then we need pbh dm instead . ] as the preinflation before the new inflation , which is responsible for the curvature perturbations on the cmb scale , any specific model is not required to be supposed .",
    "the potential of our new inflation model consists of the linear , quadratic , and @xmath3-th moment terms and we found that pbhs can be produced on @xmath2 enough to be a main component of dm .",
    "our model is based on the discrete @xmath4 symmetry @xmath5 and we find that only the @xmath6 case could produce the desired spectrum of pbhs .",
    "it is remarkable that the linear term can be consistently interpreted to come from the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking sector in the case of @xmath6 under the flatness condition at the inflection point and the vanishing cosmological constant condition .",
    "while we propose the abundant pbhs of @xmath2 as dm , we can make another peak in the pbh mass spectrum on @xmath7 .",
    "those pbhs would have contributed to gravitational waves which recently detected by ligo / virgo collaboration  @xcite as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ new inflation ] , we describe the constitution method of new inflation in supergravity and introduce our model",
    ". then we concretely evaluate the current pbh abundance in section  [ pbh mass spectrum ] .",
    "we make our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ multiple horizon crossing ] , we describe the treatments for the modes which exit the horizon at near the beginning of the second new inflation .",
    "let us briefly review the composition of new inflation in supergravity at first .",
    "here we adopt the model proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this model , we assume a discrete @xmath4 symmetry @xmath5 which is broken down to a discrete @xmath8 during and after the inflation .",
    "the inflaton superfield @xmath9 has an @xmath4 charge 2 .",
    "these assumptions lead the following effective superpotential at the leading order : @xmath10 here and hereafter we use the planck units where the reduced planck mass @xmath11 is set to be unity .",
    "the @xmath4-invariant effective khler potential can be written as , @xmath12 for these super and khler potentials , the inflaton potential in supergravity is given by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 . defining the inflaton by the real part of @xmath9 , namely @xmath15 ,",
    "it can be expanded as , @xmath16 and the slow - roll inflation can be driven either by the quadratic or @xmath3-th moment term .",
    "also it has a negative minimum at @xmath17 as , @xmath18 this negative energy would be canceled out after inflation with a positive contribution @xmath19 due to a susy - breaking effect .",
    "therefore the gravitino mass can be related with the new inflation scale as , @xmath20 the inflaton mass around the potential minimum is given by , @xmath21 therefore , if the inflaton decays into standard model particles simply by planck suppressed operators , the reheating temperature can be evaluated by , @xmath22 in the next section , we will use this reheating temperature to calculate the pbh mass spectrum . with the above assumption .",
    "this value may be marginal to realize the thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "however we have checked that desired pbh mass spectra can be achieved even for a higher reheating temperature e.g. @xmath23 . ]",
    "now let us consider the initial condition for this inflation .",
    "small field new inflation generally suffers from a severe initial condition problem .",
    "that is , both the inflaton initial field value and its time derivative should be extremely small to have a sufficiently long inflation , but originally there is no reason to stabilize the inflaton field to the potential origin since the inflaton potential should be flat enough to satisfy the slow - roll conditions .",
    "moreover , even if one can introduce some stabilizing term in the potential , new inflation realizes eternal inflation if the inflaton s initial field value is much smaller than the hubble fluctuation @xmath24 and it should continue much longer than 60 e - folds ( we want new inflation to contribute only to small scale perturbations as we will mention ) . as proposed in  @xcite ,",
    "these problems can be naturally solved in the supergravity frame work by introducing a preinflation phase before the new inflation and adding a constant term to superpotential @xmath25 . during the preinflation",
    ", the inflaton of the new inflation can have a hubble induced mass term @xmath26 through the coefficient @xmath27 of the potential .",
    "moreover the constant term in the superpotential leads the linear term @xmath28 in the potential , which shifts the potential minimum from zero to @xmath29 .",
    "the hubble induced mass keeps stabilizing the inflaton even after the preinflation until the beginning of the second new inflation @xmath30 , and therefore the initial field value of @xmath31 is given by , @xmath32 the new inflation can avoid eternal inflation as long as @xmath33 is sufficiently larger than the hubble fluctuation @xmath24 at the beginning of the new inflation .",
    "taking above things , we consider the pbh formation in the following model : @xmath34 here note that , if @xmath35 , the linear , quadratic , and @xmath3-th moment terms can have an inflection point for @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 is locally maximized at that inflection point , if the maximum of @xmath37 is still negative but quite close to zero , the slow - roll inflation are not spoiled and moreover very large curvature perturbations can be produced .",
    "the inflection point @xmath38 can be obtained as , @xmath39 then we require the flat inflection condition as , @xmath40 neglecting @xmath41 and the higher order term . with this condition",
    ", the curvature perturbations generated around @xmath42 would be large enough to produce abundant pbhs , and the concrete successful parameters will be shown in the next section . here",
    "note that the inflection point can be written as @xmath43 under this condition and therefore it is automatically set to be slightly larger than the initial field value for @xmath44 .",
    "that is because the initial field value @xmath33 is determined by the balance between the linear term @xmath45 and the preinflaiton - induced mass term @xmath46 , while the flat inflection is the point where the linear term is comparable with the self - induced mass term @xmath47 which is smaller than the preinflation - induced mass term by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "if the new inflation is assumed to realize both small perturbations like as those on the cmb scale and large perturbations which would cause the formation of pbhs , it generally takes too many e - folds in the transition from small to large perturbations since the time derivative of the slow - roll parameter itself is suppressed by the slow - roll parameters , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the e - folding number and @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the slow - roll parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "however , since we have already introduced double inflation , the new inflation can be free from the cobe normalization by simply assuming that the preinflation is responsible for the cmb scale perturbations , and then the new inflation can end in sufficiently short time in that case .",
    "indeed we will show in the next section that there are parameter regions where pbhs can be produced enough to be a main component of dm and the constraints for large scale perturbations like the cmb spectral distortion can be avoided . here",
    "if one assume that the curvature perturbations generated in the new inflation are large even apart from the inflection point , the linear term itself is required to be small enough . letting @xmath55 denote the amplitude of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations during the linear term in the potential dominantly contributes to the perturbations , the constant superpotential @xmath56 is determined through the following relation : @xmath57 therefore , for @xmath58 , @xmath56 is required to be as small as @xmath59 .",
    "the above two conditions  ( [ flat condition ] ) and ( [ alin ] ) are required for pbh formation .",
    "now combining them clarifies the @xmath60-dependence of @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath6 , @xmath63 does not depend on the new inflation scale @xmath60 and could be smaller than unity .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath64 , @xmath61 becomes much larger than unity for @xmath65 and such a large @xmath61 would spoil unitarity of the theory for example  @xcite .",
    "moreover for large @xmath3 the duration of the new inflation after the inflection point will be short due to its steep potential and it tends to make the pbh mass small .",
    "indeed we have checked that the pbh mass spectrum are tilted to the lighter mass and conflicts with the constraints on the pbh abundance for @xmath64 . for those reasons , we will concentrate on the case of @xmath6 hereafter .",
    "is uniquely favored by the anomaly free conditions for supersymmetric standard gauge groups with the discrete @xmath4 symmetry @xmath5  @xcite . ]    as an interesting fact , the small constant term @xmath56 in the superpotential can be interpreted to come from the susy - breaking sector in the case of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite since their motivation is not to produce pbhs but to modify the spectral index in new inflation and therefore the required condition is different . ]",
    "the susy - breaking f - term order @xmath66 naively arise from the term like , @xmath67 if @xmath68 obtains a vev @xmath69 , this term can lead the constant superpotential @xmath70 .",
    "indeed it can be realized in the dynamical susy breaking models proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite if the origin of @xmath68 is destabilized due to a large yukawa coupling ( @xmath71 ) , and the estimated constant term is given by @xmath72 where the dynamical scale @xmath73 is related with @xmath74 by @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , under the flat inflection condition  ( [ flat condition ] ) and the large curvature perturbation condition  ( [ alin ] ) , the vanishing cosmological constant condition  ( [ m32 ] ) gives the parameter dependence of the susy - breaking scale as @xmath76 , neglecting numerical factors .",
    "therefore the scale dependence of the constant term @xmath56 is consistent with the above assumption if and only if @xmath6 as , @xmath77 it can be checked that this consistency is retained for the concrete parameter values which we will show in the next section even if numerical factors are included .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the pbh abundance and exemplify parameter sets where pbhs constitute the main component of dm . at first , given the inflation scale @xmath60 and the reheating temperature @xmath78 , the perturbation scale can be related with the backward e - folds by  @xcite , @xmath79 we will use eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) as the reheating temperature hereafter .",
    "then , with the potential  ( [ v of varphi ] ) and the hubble induced mass @xmath80 , we can calculate the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations @xmath81 in the standard linear theory and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] as the black thick line for the following parameter values : @xmath82 in this calculation , we have simply assumed that the preinflation potential behaves as a matter component @xmath83 after the preinflation .",
    "for these parameters , the vanishing cosmological constant  ( [ m32 ] ) and the susy - breaking assumption  ( [ condition for c ] ) consistently predict @xmath84 which suggests the pure gravity mediation  @xcite . in this figure",
    ", we also show the constraints from the cmb spectral @xmath85-distortion as the red region .",
    "the cmb @xmath85-distortion from the silk damping of a single @xmath86-mode can be approximated by  @xcite , @xmath87      -\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}}{31.6}\\right)^2\\right]\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 represent the wavenumber in @xmath89 .",
    "we have used the current 2@xmath90 upper limit @xmath91 by the cobe / firas experiment  @xcite .",

    "the red line represents the constraints on the power spectrum from the non - detection of the cmb @xmath85-distortion estimated by eq .",
    "( [ mu - dist ] ) .",
    "the modes @xmath92 actually reenter the horizon between the two inflations and the treatments for them are described in appendix  [ multiple horizon crossing ] . ]    with use of this power spectrum , the pbh abundance can be calculated as follows . at first",
    ", the mass of pbh is almost given by the horizon mass when the overdensity reenters the horizon , and let @xmath93 denote the ratio between them here .",
    "that is , the pbh mass corresponding with the scale @xmath86 is given by , @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the horizon mass at the matter - radiation equality calculated as , @xmath96 also we have used an approximation that the effective d.o.f . for energy density @xmath97 is almost equal to that for entropy density @xmath98 .",
    "using @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , we can finally obtain  @xcite , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the solar mass . in the simple analytic calculation  @xcite",

    "the formation rate of pbhs @xmath106 is given by the probability of excess over the threshold .",
    "that is , under the assumption that the density perturbations follow the gaussian distribution , is as small as @xmath107 and for such a small ng it is known that the predicted pbh abundance is hardly affected  @xcite .",
    "however the second peak on @xmath108 which we will show later might be modified by ng effects since it corresponds with the phase of the beginning of the new inflation .",
    "we leave this problem for future works . ]",
    "@xmath109 here @xmath110 represents the threshold density perturbation and we will adopt the simple analytic estimation @xmath111  @xcite .",
    "@xmath112 is the variance of the comoving density perturbations coarse - grained on @xmath113 , which is given by  @xcite , @xmath114 @xmath115 represents the fourier transformed window function and we will adopt the gaussian window @xmath116 in the following calculations .",
    "note that the pbh mass and coarse - graining scale @xmath86 are related by eq .",
    "( [ mpbh ] ) .",
    "the formation rate directly gives the ratio of the pbh energy density to the total energy density at the horizon reentering , @xmath117 .",
    "therefore the current pbh fraction to dm for a single mass mode can be derived as , @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the current dm abundance @xmath120  @xcite .",

    "we also show several observational constraints for pbh abundance as red regions  @xcite . here",
    "we have not used the constraints from existence of neutron stars  @xcite and white dwarfs  @xcite in globular clusters since they require the high dm - density assumption whose validity seems questionable as mentioned in introduction . although the shown pbh fraction does not reach unity in each logarithmic mass bin , the total pbh fraction : @xmath121 reaches unity with the current parameters .",
    "therefore our model can describe the formation of sufficient pbhs to be a main component of dm .",
    "one might think that the pbh mass spectrum can be shifted to the more massive direction and even the neutron stars constraints could be avoided for some parameters .",

    "for both the solid and dashed lines , the total integrated fraction is about unity , therefore these models predicts abundant pbhs as a main component of dm .",
    "moreover in the dashed line case there is another peak at @xmath7 , which might cause gw150914  @xcite . ]    before ending this section , let us concentrate on the sharp peaks of the power spectrum around @xmath122 shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "this peak comes from the fact that at the beginning of the new inflation the hubble induced mass @xmath80 can not be neglected yet and the inflaton potential is being slightly flattened due to its stabilizing effect at first . for a slightly smaller @xmath56 ( namely a slightly flatter linear potential ) , this peak can be enlarged and another peak of the fraction for more massive pbhs can be shown . for the following parameters : @xmath123 the resultant power spectrum and pbh fraction are plotted in fig .",
    "[ power ] and [ fpbh ] as the black dashed lines .",
    "again the total pbh fraction is about unity ( @xmath124 ) for them , but they show another peak at @xmath125 .",
    "recently ligo / virgo collaboration succeeded in the first direct detection of gravitational waves gw150914 , which came from an inspiral and merger of a black hole binary  @xcite .",
    "the masses of these black holes are estimated as @xmath126 and @xmath127 . taking this ,",
    "the binary formation rate of pbhs whose masses are around @xmath128 has been evaluated by several authors  @xcite , and the authors of @xcite claimed that the binary formation rate of pbhs satisfying current constraints ( @xmath129 ) would be high enough to be consistent with the black hole merger rate @xmath130 inferred from ligo observations  @xcite ( however it was claimed in @xcite that the binary formation rate might be smaller than that evaluated in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore our model might explain both of dm whose main component is as @xmath131 pbhs and gw150914 from the merger of the @xmath7 pbh binary .- pbh could be produced by the gauge field production with the chern - simons coupling @xmath132 . ]",
    "however , the existence of the peak around @xmath133 in our model should be examined more carefully since the corresponding fluctuation modes reenter the horizon between the preinflation and the new inflation and in such a case effects of the metric perturbations that are not included in the present analysis might be important .",
    "so we need to solve full evolutions of fluctuations of scalar fields and metric perturbations , which will be investigated in future work .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new inflation model as a second phase of a double inflation consistently constituted in supergravity frame work , where sufficient primordial black holes ( pbhs ) can be produced to be a main component of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "any specific inflationary model is not required for the preinflation which is responsible for the large scale curvature perturbations , as long as it is consistent with the observations of , e.g. , cmb .",
    "the potential of the new inflation in our model consists of the linear , quadratic , and cubic terms and has a flat inflection point where pbhs can be produced .",
    "the specific power spectra of the curvature perturbations and the resultant pbh mass spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] and [ fpbh ] for two parameter sets  ( [ single peak parameter ] ) and ( [ dp parameter ] ) .",
    "the inflection point corresponds with @xmath2 pbhs and they constitute the bulk of dm in our model . in addition , we can make another peak for the pbh mass spectrum on @xmath7 as indicated by the black dashed line in fig .",
    "such a peak corresponds with the beginning of the new inflation and those pbhs might cause the gravitational waves detected by ligo / virgo collaboration .",

    "in this appendix , we will describe the treatments for the modes which exit the horizon at the end of the preinflation once , enter the horizon between two inflations , and then reexit the horizon at the beginning of the second new inflation .",
    "they correspond with the modes for @xmath92 in our parameters .",
    "their dynamics are non - trivial due to their multiple horizon crossing and the amplitudes of them at the second horizon exit which determine the curvature perturbations in the new inflation have to be evaluated carefully .",
    "to do so , one must solve eom for perturbations continuously over the two inflations and connection phase , including the effects of the metric perturbations .",
    "however here let us roughly estimate them in the super- and subhorizon limit without metric perturbations .",
    "the linear eom for perturbations which have a hubble induced mass @xmath134 is given by , @xmath135 in the second line , we have used the super- and subhorizon limit .",
    "the subhorizon eom can be always rewritten , with use of the conformal time @xmath136 and in the subhorizon limit , as , @xmath137 and therefore it only has oscillating solutions whose amplitudes decrease as @xmath138 . on the other hand , assuming that the background eos is given by @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , the superhorizon eom reads , @xmath141 it can be easily solved by assuming the power - law solution @xmath142 and the real part of the power is given by @xmath143=\\frac{-1 + 3\\omega}{2(1+\\omega)}$ ] .",
    "that is , the amplitude of the solutions damps as @xmath144 .",
    "also , in the exact de sitter background , the hubble parameter is constant and the two solutions are soon found as @xmath145 . namely the perturbations damp as @xmath146 ( therefore the damping factor @xmath147 for @xmath148 can be used also for the de sitter case in which @xmath149 ) . in summary ,",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations decreases as @xmath138 in the subhorizon limit and as @xmath147 in the superhorizon limit .     and the multiple horizon crossing mode @xmath86 .",
    "the time before @xmath150 corresponds with that during the preinflation , while @xmath151 represents the beginning of the new inflation . between the two inflations , the horizon scale generally decreases as @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "therefore the modes which exit the horizon at near the end of the preinflation can reenter the horizon during the preinflaton oscillation phase , and then reexit the horizon at the beginning of the new inflation .",
    "those modes contribute to the sharp peaks of the power spectra around @xmath122 shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] , which can lead the second peak to the pbh fraction on @xmath7 . in the super or subhorizon limits , it can be shown that the amplitude of the perturbations at the second horizon exit @xmath154 is equal to the standard value @xmath155 in spite of their complicated horizon crossing process . ]",
    "now let us evaluate the concrete amplitude of the multiple horizon crossing modes at the horizon exit during the new inflation .",
    "letting @xmath156 and @xmath157 denote the horizon scale at the end of the preinflation and the beginning of the new inflation , such modes correspond with @xmath158 .",
    "we illustrate an schematic image about the relation between the wavelength @xmath86 and the horizon scale @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ ah ] as the solid and dot - dashed lines respectively .",
    "at the first horizon exit during the preinflation , the perturbation amplitude is given by the standard one @xmath160 .",
    "after that , the amplitude decreases until the second horizon exit during the new inflation as , @xmath161 following the scale factor dependences which we showed previously . here",
    "the subscript 1 , 2 , and 3 represent each horizon crossing time during the preinflation , between two inflations , and during the new inflation respectively . also we have referred to the eos between two inflations as @xmath162 . noting that the horizon scale @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath163 , it can be rewritten as , @xmath164 finally , using @xmath165 , we can obtain , @xmath166 that is , the resultant amplitude is eventually identical with the standard one even though they experienced a complicated process .",
    "the results obtained in this appendix would be changed if the effects of , e.g. , the metric perturbations or the resonance .",
    "for example , if one assumes the mass term chaotic inflation as the preinflation , the hubble induced mass @xmath167 where @xmath168 represents the inflaton of the preinflation , leads the parametric resonance  @xcite . however this problem would be solved by introducing a khler coupling @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the preinflaton superfield , since this khler potential brings @xmath171 coupling for example and it cancels and reduces the oscillation of the hubble induced mass .",
    "also the metric perturbations would also grow density perturbations on subhorizon scales  @xcite .",
    "however the peak of the pbh mass spectrum on @xmath7 is mainly caused by the largest scale mode @xmath172 which is hardly affected by the subhorizon effect .",
    "moreover , even if the amplitude of the perturbations would be slightly modified , it could be absorbed into the parameter tuning . anyway more strict analysis for those modes is postponed to future works .",

    "<S> we propose a novel scenario to produce abundant primordial black holes ( pbhs ) in new inflation which is a second phase of a double inflation in the supergravity frame work . in our model , some preinflation phase before the new inflation is assumed and it would be responsible for the primordial curvature perturbations on the cosmic microwave background scale , while the new inflation produces only the small scale perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> our new inflation model has linear , quadratic , and cubic terms in its potential and pbh production corresponds with its flat inflection point . </S>",
    "<S> the linear term can be interpreted to come from a supersymmetry - breaking sector , and with this assumption , the vanishing cosmological constant condition after inflation and the flatness condition for the inflection point can be consistently satisfied . </S>"
