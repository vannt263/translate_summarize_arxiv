    "according to a nomenclature that has emerged in various physical and mathematical contexts , one refers to the so - called ter - martirosyan  skornyakov ( henceforth tms ) operators as a distinguished class of quantum hamiltonians for systems of non - relativistic particles with two - body `` _ _ zero - range _ _ '' ( or `` _ _ contact _ _ '' , or `` _ _ point _ _ '' ) interaction .",
    "this terminology stems from early works in nuclear physics , where it was the nucleon - nucleon coupling to be initially modelled as a `` contact '' interaction .",
    "nowadays the typical experimental realisation is that of ultra - cold atom systems where , by feshbach resonance methods , the two - body scattering length is tuned to a magnitude that exceeds by many orders its nominal value , and the effective range of the interaction shrinks correspondingly to a very small scale , so that to an extremely good approximation the interaction can be considered to be of infinite scattering length and/or zero range . in section [ sec : history_tms ]",
    "we will provide a more diffuse context and references .",
    "informally speaking , tms hamiltonians are qualified by the two characteristics of acting as the @xmath0-body @xmath1-dimensional _ free _ hamiltonian on functions that are supported _ away _ from the `` coincidence hyperplanes '' @xmath2 , and of having a domain that consists of square - integrable functions @xmath3 , possibly with fermionic or bosonic exchange symmetry , which satisfy specific asymptotics when @xmath4 for some or for all particle couples @xmath5 .",
    "this models an interaction supported only on the hyperplanes @xmath2 .",
    "it is customary to refer to this ultra - violet asymptotics as the `` _ _ tms condition _ _ '' .",
    "the explicit form for the tms condition has various versions ( see , e.g. , , , , , , or below ) , all essentially equivalent to each other . noticeably , such asymptotics emerge from different contexts and languages : on the one side the physical heuristics for an `` effective '' low - energy two - body scattering due to an interaction of very short range , on the other side the mathematical theory of self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators on hilbert space .",
    "this is a fascinating history of reciprocal influence and mutual inspiration between `` early days '' nuclear physics , modern condensed matter physics , and mathematical operator theory and self - adjoint extension theory .",
    "section [ sec : history_tms ] below will partially survey it .",
    "tms hamiltonians represent the modern operator - theoretic approach to multi - particle quantum systems with two - body point interaction , and have an intimate connection to the alternative approach based on energy quadratic forms .",
    "they arise as natural effective models , based on stringent physical heuristics on the behaviour of the many - body wave - function when _ two _ particles come on top of each other . in many circumstances , however , which depend essentially on the mass of the particles and on possible additional symmetries of the system , a formal tms hamiltonian fails to be self - adjoint and each of its self - adjoint extensions accounts for a different behaviour of the system when _ three _ particles get closer and closer to the same point .",
    "the question is then to identify these extensions ( if more than one ) and to study their stability and spectral properties .",
    "this is even more so since quantum systems with zero - range interactions may exhibit two somewhat exotic phenomena , as compared with the case of ordinary finite range potentials : the so - called `` _ _ thomas effect _ _ '' , namely the emergence of an infinite discrete sequence of bound states with negative energy diverging to @xmath6 and eigenfunction collapsing onto the barycentre , and the `` _ _ efimov effect _ _ '' , that consists of an infinite sequence of bound states with negative energy arbitrarily close to zero and eigenfunctions extending on a larger and larger spatial scale , with a non - square - integrable limit .",
    "the tms hamiltonians account for such phenomena as well .    in this work",
    "we put the emphasis on the mathematical scheme within which a two - body interaction modelled by means of a tms condition ( a _ physical _ requirement ) does correspond to a self - adjoint hamiltonian ( a _ mathematical _ constraint that ensures the well - posedness and the correct interpretation of the quantum model ) .    here",
    "is how the general problem is posed , as we shall elaborate further in the historical review of section [ sec : history_tms ] and then in the concrete settings of sections [ sec:2body - point ] and [ sec:2 + 1 ]    * one starts ( mostly in @xmath7 dimensions ) with the operator @xmath8 obtained by _ restricting _ the @xmath0-body free hamiltonian to the regular wave - functions that are supported away from the coincidence hyperplanes @xmath9 .",
    "additional partial or global symmetries for @xmath8 are possible , such as rotational symmetries , or exchange bosonic or fermionic symmetries for some or all of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "@xmath8 is clearly densely defined , symmetric , and positive , and any its self - adjoint extension is naturally interpreted as a model for an interaction supported at @xmath10 . *",
    "the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 are restrictions of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , one first characterises the domain and the action of @xmath11 and then one selects a special class of restrictions of @xmath11 , which are obtained by reducing the domain of @xmath11 to only those functions @xmath12 satisfying , for some or all couples of variables @xmath13 , the condition that , if @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a regular change of variables , then @xmath16 in @xmath17 are the conjugate fourier variables to @xmath18 , the function @xmath19 depends on @xmath12 and on the considered couple @xmath5 , but not on @xmath20 , and the constant @xmath21 is prescribed and is @xmath20-independent too .",
    "equation above is one version of the so - called ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition .",
    "it is based on stringent physical heuristics ( see the discussion in section [ sec : history_tms ] and - below ) that allow one to interpret it as an interaction in the @xmath22-channel with _ zero range _ and @xmath23-wave scattering length equal to @xmath24 . *",
    "the tms condition selects a `` physical '' extension @xmath25 of @xmath8 labelled by the conventional parametrisation @xmath26 .",
    "the mathematical problem is then to recognise @xmath25 as a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 , or to identify and classify its self - adjoint extensions , and then to investigate its spectral and stability properties .",
    "the scheme above , which was made explicit for the first time by minlos @xcite in 1987 ( based on an old seminal but very concise work of minlos and faddeev @xcite in 1961 ) , has been since then the object of numerous investigations that we will quote in section [ sec : history_tms ] the general question of the self - adjoint realisation of @xmath25 and of its stability and spectral properties is still open .",
    "an amount of partial information is available for special cases of @xmath0-body systems .    in this work , beyond placing the problem into a historical perspective ( see section [ sec : history_tms ] ) , we discuss how the tms condition can be proved to be a _ self - adjointness condition _ , based on the extension theory specifically tailored for semi - bounded symmetric operators , as developed by kren , viik , and birman .",
    "( we review the main results of this theory in appendix [ app : kvb ] and we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive discussion . )    the use of the kren - viik - birman theory is in fact at the basis of all recent studies on the self - adjoint realisation of the operator @xmath25 selected by the tms condition : in this context , it allows one to reduce the problem of the self - adjointness of @xmath25 on the hilbert space @xmath27 ( with possible symmetries ) to the problem of the self - adjointness of a suitable integral operator on the space of the functions @xmath19 s appearing in the asymptotics .",
    "what we do here is on the first place to elaborate in full detail the precise application of the kren - viik - birman theory to the tms condition , with a discussion and through intermediate results that to our knowledge are not present in the literature .",
    "further , we put for the first time the emphasis on the crucial difference between the tms condition as a _ point - wise _ identity , and the same condition interpreted as a suitable _ functional _ identity , as we now explain .    in section",
    "[ sec:2body - point ] , which contains the first group of our results , we discuss the tms condition for the simplest composite system possible , consisting of two particles with point interaction .",
    "this is a well - studied quantum system that is completely understood within the standard self - adjoint extension theory a la von neumann .",
    "first we re - obtain the well - known hamiltonian of the system solely by means of the kren - viik - birman theory , a procedure that we did not manage to find elsewhere in the literature .",
    "this yields an alternative equivalent characterisation of the whole class of self - adjoint extensions of the `` away - from - hyperplanes '' free hamiltonian @xmath8 that represented the starting point of the analysis  see step 1 of the general scheme above .",
    "we then show that imposing the tms condition to functions in the domain of @xmath11 reproduces , for all possible values of the scattering length @xmath28 , _ all _ the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular this shows that the tms condition is a self - adjointness condition .    in section [ sec:2 + 1 ] , where the second group of our results is presented , we follow the same approach for a more complicated system consisting of three particles with point interaction  we develop our explicit discussion for the so - called `` 2 + 1''-fermionic system , two identical fermions coupled with a third particle of different nature . exploiting again the general results of the kren - viik - birman theory",
    ", we find that the tms condition is a self - adjointness condition , which selects a sub - class of extensions of @xmath11 , only if it is given as a suitable functional identity . as a generic point - wise identity ,",
    "instead , the tms condition is in general not even a condition for a symmetric extension of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we show that the issue of the self - adjoint realisation of the tms condition does indeed boil down to the self - adjointness problem of a simpler integral operator ( that acts on the so - called `` space of charges '' ) as normally given for granted in the literature , _ but _ on different ( more regular ) functional spaces than those considered so far .",
    "this brings us to the natural follow - up of the present analysis , which was in fact our original motivation and that we intend now to develop in a future work .",
    "there are indeed not completely understood discrepancies in the literature between the ranges of the particle masses in which the tms condition for three - body systems is shown to be a self - adjointness condition , or instead to give rise to a symmetric extension of @xmath8 with its own family of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "such discrepancies emerge between the operator - theoretic approach sketched above and an alternative approach through quadratic forms ( i.e. , the construction of a closed and semi - bounded quadratic form such that the function in the domain of self - adjoint operator that realises it display the tms asymptotics ) .",
    "re - visiting the operator - theoretic approach in view of our present findings is likely to account for an explanation .",
    "we briefly elaborate on this point in the final section [ sec : developments ]",
    "in this section we present the historical emergence of tms operators in the physics and mathematics of point interactions .",
    "it therefore should _ not _ be regarded as a complete review on the history of point interactions !    in the 1930 s quantum mechanics began to be applied to the newly observed nuclear phenomena . at first , the decrease by a factor @xmath29 from the atomic to the nuclear scale made it plausible to model the interaction among nucleons as a delta - like interaction .    in 1932",
    "wigner @xcite calculated that the nuclear forces interaction must be of very short range and very strong magnitude .",
    "this led three years later first bethe and peierls @xcite and then thomas @xcite to describe the neutron - proton scattering by means of the two - body schrdinger equation in the approximation of a potential of very short range , an approach subsequently developed by fermi @xcite and breit @xcite with the introduction of the so - called `` delta pseudo - potential '' .",
    "formulated in modern terms , the celebrated `` _ _ bethe - peierls contact condition _ _ '' , which is still today ubiquitous in many formal physical treatments , prescribes on the basis of physical heuristics that the wave - function @xmath3 of @xmath0 three - dimensional particles subject to a two - body zero - range interaction of scattering length @xmath30 among particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 behaves asymptotically as @xmath33 where the point - wise limit is meant as @xmath34 for some function @xmath35 of the variable @xmath36 in the hyperplane @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , what makes this approximation appealing , and computationally advantageous , is its dependence on few parameters only ( the @xmath30 s ) , instead of the complete knowledge of the interaction .",
    "while bethe and peierls had studied the problem of _ two _ low - energy nucleons with contact interaction and obtained for the two - body problem , thomas had considered the _ three - body _ problem showing that as the range of the two - body forces tends to zero the ground state of the three - body system can approach @xmath6 , even when the ground state energies of all two - body subsystems remain constant .",
    "this effect , referred to since then as the `` _ _ thomas effect _ _ '' , was the first evidence that the deceptively simple three - body problem with zero - range interaction has a much richer ( and potentially much more complicated ) phenomenology than the analogous two - body problem .",
    "the next extensive study of a system of _ three _ low - energy nucleons appeared some 20 years later , in 1955 , due to ter - martirosyan and skornyakov @xcite , two nuclear physicists who credited landau for the ideas they exploited .",
    "they assumed that the bethe - peierls condition remains valid in _ each _ two - body channel and they used it as boundary condition for solving the eigenvalue problem for the three - body schrdinger equation with formal delta - like two - body potentials .",
    "for brevity let us revisit their conclusion in the simplest case of spinless identical particles , for which they made use of standard centre - of - mass jacobi coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 and introduced a formal delta - like potential @xmath39 for wave - functions @xmath40 . by suitably expressing @xmath41 in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fourier conjugate variables ) , they found that ( in units @xmath45 and particle mass @xmath46 ) @xmath12 is a bound state of energy @xmath47 whenever @xmath48 is a solution to the integral equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath28 is the @xmath23-wave scattering length in each two - body channel .",
    "analogues to equation were later found for other systems with point interactions , among which , to mention those that have received the largest attention , three - body systems with different symmetries ( three distinguishable particles , two identical fermions plus a third particle of different nature , etc . ) , four - body systems with two distinct couples of identical fermions , and more generally @xmath51 systems with @xmath0 identical fermions of one type plus @xmath52 identical fermions of another type .",
    "each equation of this class is today referred to as a `` _ _ ter - martirosyan  skornyakov equation _ _ '' .",
    "the subject proved soon to be worth a deeper understanding , despite the effectiveness of the description . on the one hand the manipulations of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov ( as well as the previous ones by bethe , peierls , thomas , fermi , and breit ) were rather formal for mathematical standards and called for a more rigorous justification .",
    "on the other hand , an evidence of some sort of indeterminate physical description emerged when danilov @xcite in 1961 observed that the tms equation has a solution @xmath53 for arbitrary values of @xmath54 , with large momentum asymptotics @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an explicit universal constant and @xmath57 are two further constants that depend on @xmath54 . inspired by ideas ( mainly of gribov ) by which some additional `` experimental '' parameter that can not be computed using only two - body experimental data was needed for the full description of the three - body system , danilov proposed an ad hoc removal of this non - physical continuum of eigenvalues on @xmath58 by constraining the solutions to to have the form with @xmath59 for some additionally prescribed parameter @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 was in some vague sense given the meaning of a three - body parameter , as opposite to @xmath62 in which is a parameter of the two - body problem for each couple of bosons . under the restriction ,",
    "equation has a discrete and infinite set of solutions @xmath63 , with energies @xmath64 as @xmath65 according to the asymptotics @xmath66 a quantitative manifestation of the thomas effect .    in modern mathematical terms , the phenomenon noted by danilov is understood as follows : the three - body point - interaction hamiltonian implicitly identified by ter - martirosyan and skornyakov by means of the condition for its eigenstates at given two - body scattering length @xmath67 , is _ not _ a self - adjoint operator and it admits a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions , labelled by @xmath60 ; for each @xmath61 , the corresponding self - adjoint hamiltonian has a countable discrete spectrum accumulating exponentially to @xmath6 with corresponding eigenfunctions that collapse onto the barycentre ; the union of the negative spectra of all such self - adjoint extensions is the whole negative real line .    motivated by the scheme of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov for the three - body problem with point interaction and by danilov s observation , minlos and faddeev @xcite in the same year 1961 provided essentially the whole explanation above , including the asymptotics and , in the form of two beautiful short announcements , albeit with no proofs or further elaborations .",
    "theirs can be considered as the beginning of the mathematics of quantum systems with zero - range interactions .",
    "this is even more so because for the first time the problem was placed within a general mathematical framework , the theory of self - adjoint extensions of semi - bounded symmetric operator , that kren , viik , and birman had developed between the mid 1940 s and the mid 1950 s ( see appendix [ app : kvb ] ) .",
    "a somewhat different approach characterised the start of the mathematical study of the _ two - body _ problem . in 1960 - 1961",
    ", a few months before the works of minlos and faddeev on the three - body problem , berezin and faddeev @xcite published the first rigorous analysis of a three - dimensional model with two particles coupled by a delta - like interaction .",
    "the emphasis was put in realising the formal hamiltonian @xmath68 as a self - adjoint extension of the restriction @xmath69 ( in the relative variable @xmath70 between the two particles ) .",
    "working in fourier transform , they recognised that the latter operator has deficiency indices @xmath71 and they characterised the whole family @xmath72 of its self - adjoint extensions as the operators @xmath73 defined on the domain of @xmath74-functions @xmath75 such that , as @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( for a more direct comparison  see in the following  we have replaced here the parameter @xmath62 of the notation of @xcite with @xmath78 . )    as - were only announced with no derivation , with a sole reference to the monograph @xcite of akhiezer and glazman on linear operators in hilbert space , we are to understand that berezin and faddeev came to their conclusion by methods of von neumann s self - adjoint extension theory , as presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter vii ) , combined with explicit calculations in fourier transform .",
    "this leaves the question open on why they did not approach the extension problem within the same language of kren , viik , and birman , as used by minlos and faddeev for the three - body case . in this language , as we work out in section [ sec:2body - point ] , - would have emerged as a very clean application of the general theory and , most importantly , the asymptotics in would have arisen with a natural and intimate connection with the tms equation .",
    "berezin and faddeev rather focused on re - interpreting the action of the hamiltonian @xmath25 as a renormalised rank - one perturbation of the free laplacian , re - writing in position coordinates as @xmath79 we conjecture that they did not know the old work of bethe and peierls for two nucleons , or they did not consider it relevant in their context , for no word is spent in @xcite to derive the singularity @xmath80 as @xmath81 from their asymptotics .    with the subsequent theoretical and experimental advances in nuclear physics  the initial playground for models of point interactions",
    " it became clear that the assumption of zero range was only a crude simplification of no fundamental level .",
    "the lack of a physically stringent character for the idealisation of zero range in experimentally observed quantum - mechanical systems , and the somewhat obscure emergence of the unboundedness from below for the self - adjoint realisations of the three - body hamiltonian , decreased the physical interest towards point interactions and left their rigorous study in a relatively marginal position , and the approach of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov quiescent . moreover , after faddeev published in 1963 his fundamental work @xcite on the three - body problem with regular two - body forces , the concern of the physicists switched over to the numerical solutions of the corresponding faddeev equations . in the russian physical literature , mainly under the input of faddeev , methods and models of point interactions , albeit not fully rigorous , moved their applicability to atomic and molecular physics , a mainstream that ideally culminates with the late 1970 s monograph of demkov and ostrovskii @xcite on the `` zero - range potentials '' and their application to atomic physics .",
    "the use of formal delta - like potentials remained for some decades as a tool for a formal first - order perturbation theory ; in addition , the kren - viik - birman self - adjoint extension theory lost ground to von neumann s theory in the literature in english language on the mathematics for quantum mechanics ",
    "it rather evolved in more modern forms in application to boundary value problems for partial differential equations , mainly in the modern theory of boundary triplets .",
    "it is the merit of albeverio , gesztesy , and hegh - krohn , and their collaborators ( among whom , streit and wu ) , in the end of the 1970 s and throughout the 1980 s , to have unified an amount of previous investigations by establishing a proper mathematical branch on rigorous models of point interactions , with a systematic study of _ two - body _ hamiltonians and of _ one - body _ hamiltonians with finite or infinitely many _ fixed centers _ of point interaction .",
    "we refer to the monograph @xcite for a comprehensive overview on this production , and especially to the end - of - chapter notes in @xcite for a detailed account of the previous contributions .",
    "the main tools in this new mainstream were : von neumann s extension theory on the first place ( hence with no reference any longer to the methods of kren - viik - birman ) , by which point interaction hamiltonians were constructed as self - adjoint extensions of the restriction of the free laplacian to functions that vanish in a neighbourhood of the point where the interaction is supported ; resolvent identities ( of kren and of konno - kuroda type , see ( * ? ? ? * appendices a and b ) ) by which these self - adjoint extensions were recognised to be finite - rank perturbations of the free laplacian , in the resolvent sense , and were also re - obtained by resolvent limits of schrdinger hamiltonians with shrinking potentials ; plus an amount of additional methods ( dirichlet quadratic forms , non - standard analysis methods , renormalisation methods ) for specific problems .",
    "let us emphasize , in particular , that the original heuristic arguments of bethe and peierls and their two - body contact condition find a rigorous ground based on the fact , which can be proved within von neumann s extension theory ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems i.1.1.1 and i.1.1.3 ) ) , that any self - adjoint extension of @xmath82 on @xmath74 has a domain whose elements behave as @xmath83 as @xmath81 , as an @xmath23-wave ( hence a `` low - energy '' ) boundary conditions , for some @xmath84 $ ] .    as for the initial three - body problem with two - body point interaction ,",
    "it finally re - gained centrality from the mathematical point of view ( while physically a stringent experimental counterpart was still lacking ) around the end of the 1980 s and throughout the 1990 s .",
    "this was first due to minlos and his school @xcite ( among which melnikov , mogilner , and shermatov ) , by means of the operator - theoretic approach used for three identical bosons by minlos and faddeev , and slightly later due to dellantonio and his school @xcite ( among which figari and teta ) , with an approach based on quadratic forms , where the `` physical '' energy form is first regularised by means of an ultra - violet cut - off and a suitable renormalisation procedure , and then is shown to be realised by a self - adjoint hamiltonian . an alternative direction was started further later by pavlov and a school that included kuperin , makarov , melezhik , merkuriev , and motovilov , @xcite , by indroducing internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , a spin - spin contact interaction , so as to realise semi - bounded below three - body hamiltonians .    after a further period of relative quiescence , the subject has been experiencing a new boost , due to the last decade s rapid progress in the manipulation techniques for ultra - cold atoms and , in particular , for tuning the effective @xmath23-wave scattering length by means of a magnetically induced feshbach resonance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.4.2 ) .",
    "this has made it possible , among others , to prepare and study ultra - cold gases in the so - called `` _ _ unitary regime _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the case of negligible two - body interaction range and huge , virtually infinite , two - body scattering length ( both lengths being compared to a standard reference length such as the bohr radius ) . in such a regime , unitary gases show properties , including superfluidity , that have the remarkable feature of being universal in several respects @xcite , and are under active experimental and theoretical investigation . as we do not have space here for an outlook on such an active field , we refer to the overview given in the introductory sections of the works @xcite and to the references therein .",
    "let us only underline that from the experimental point of view , zero - range interactions in ultra - cold atom physics are today far from being just an idealisation of real - world two - body potentials with small support and in many realisations the zero - range , delta - like character of the interaction turns out to be an extremely realistic and in fact an unavoidable description .    in turn , all this has brought new impulse and motivations to the already developing mathematical research on the subject , with a series of fundamental contributions in the last few years @xcite , many of which provide rigorous ground to experimental or numerical evidence on the physical side .",
    "the hamiltonian of point interaction between two particles in three dimension is well known since the first rigorous attempt @xcite by berezin and faddeev in 1961 , which we have already mentioned in section [ sec : history_tms ] , and the seminal work @xcite by albeverio and hegh - krohn in 1981 . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter i.1 ) one can find the complete discussion of the self - adjoint realisation of this operator , its explicit domain and action , its resolvent , its spectral properties , its approximation by short - range potentials , and its scattering theory .",
    "in the first part of this section we shall re - obtain this hamiltonian and its main properties within the self - adjoint extension scheme of kren - viik - birman , as opposite to von neumann s scheme used in the above works .",
    "we follow this line both for general reference , because to our knowledge this approach has never been worked out in the literature , and above all because we need to establish the grounds for the second part of this section , where we shall realise the point interaction  la ter - martirosyan  skornyakov . for the tools from the kren - viik - birman theory we shall make use of",
    ", we refer to the appendix [ app : kvb ] and , more diffusely , to the work @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the operator @xmath85 which is clearly a densely defined , symmetric , closed , and positive operator on the hilbert space @xmath74 .",
    "the variable @xmath86 has the meaning of relative variable between the two particles : after removing the centre of mass of the two - body system , the only relevant problem is in the relative variable .",
    "@xmath8 is the closure of the negative laplacian restricted to the smooth functions compactly supported away from the origin , and @xmath87 the space above is clearly a closed subspace of @xmath88 , and it is also proper , as shown in and below .",
    "the free hamiltonian on @xmath89 is the natural starting point when one aims at constructing a singular interaction supported only at @xmath90 , and any self - adjoint extension of this operator has the natural interpretation of a `` candidate '' hamiltonian for the point interaction .    throughout this discussion",
    "it will be convenient to work in fourier transform .",

    "we summarise the above analysis by saying that    * the operator @xmath212 , defined by - in terms of a self - adjoint extension @xmath460 of @xmath498 on @xmath392 , where @xmath499 , @xmath397 is a densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath397 on @xmath454 with @xmath455 , and @xmath500 is the component of @xmath338 on @xmath501 with domain @xmath502 , is a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 because it satisfies the condition , which is a special case of the conditions of self - adjoint extension of the kren - viik - birman theory ; * and moreover @xmath212 is a hamiltonian of ter - martirosyan  skornyakov type because , through - , _ implies _ the tms asymptotics - .",
    "we observe , however , two fundamental differences with respect to the construction of the point interaction hamiltonian for the two - body system . in the two - body case ,",
    "the tms condition , imposed in the asymptotics of the elements of @xmath113 , turns out to be a _ condition of self - adjoint extension_. in the 2 + 1 fermionic system , instead ,    * the tms condition is found to hold only for a class of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 , those identified a la kren - viik - birman by the _",
    "constraint , * and if one imposes as a point - wise identity valid for a generic class of @xmath35 s , one is _ not _ guaranteed yet to have identified a domain of self - adjointness for an extension of @xmath8 , because in general such an ansatz is not implemented by a self - adjoint operator on @xmath183 .",
    "remark a clarification in retrospective on the emergence and the meaning of the operators @xmath397 and @xmath458 introduced in proposition [ lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] above is surely beneficial at this point .",
    "the key issue that arises evidently in our discussion is that defines a densely defined , symmetric operator @xmath338 on @xmath74 which fails to map a linear space of certain spherically symmetric @xmath448-functions into @xmath503 , whereas it does map into the latter space all the @xmath448-functions that are @xmath201-orthogonal to the spherically symmetric ones . as a consequence ,",
    "unlike what is customarily given for granted at this point in the literature , there arises the issue to make the symmetric operator @xmath346 _ densely defined _ on the space of charges @xmath392 and to realise it self - adjointly .",
    "however , one would like to have a self - adjoint operator on @xmath392 precisely of the form @xmath346 : indeed on the one hand by general facts ( krein - vishik - birman ) a self - adjoint operator on @xmath392 identifies a self - adjoint hamiltonian of point interaction for the three - body system , and on the other hand the structure @xmath346 results in a ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition for the elements in the domain of such an hamiltonian .",
    "the way to retrieve a tms - like hamiltonian was then to cure @xmath346 on the sector of spherical symmetry , by replacing @xmath338 with a modified operator @xmath504 , where @xmath444 is the restriction of @xmath338 to the subspace @xmath505 and @xmath397 is an arbitrary self - adjoint operator in @xmath454 _ with values in _ @xmath503 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath399 is now symmetric and densely defined on @xmath392 and any its self - adjoint extension identifies a tms hamiltonian for the three - body systems .",
    "for such a hamiltonian , the tms condition emerges only when the charge @xmath35 has symmetry @xmath420 ; on the sector @xmath506 what holds instead is the weaker condition .",
    "the latter still prescribes that the generic element @xmath495 of the domain of the tms hamiltonian has a leading singularity @xmath507 as @xmath508 when the charge @xmath35 associated to @xmath114 is spherically symmetric , however no @xmath62-constraint is prescribed between singular and regular part of @xmath114 .",
    "this larger freedom in the unconstrained regular part reflects precisely the arbitrariness of @xmath397 .",
    "for the two - body system with point interaction , imposing the tms asymptotics at scattering length @xmath509 selects the whole one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 , the formal free hamiltonian defined away from the coincidence configurations . for larger systems",
    ", @xmath8 has infinite deficiency indices and the tms asymptotics emerge for a proper subclass of extensions of @xmath8 , provided that the charges are taken in a domain of suitable regularity and symmetry .",
    "indeed , except for the two - body case , the tms condition expresses _ point - wise _ asymptotics , which per se is not enough to be a condition of self - adjointness : the latter has to be a suitable _ functional _ condition , such as in the preceding discussion .",
    "recognising a tms condition as a self - adjointness condition , by means of the general classification of self - adjoint extensions given by the kren - viik - birman theory , is an idea that dates back to the original announcements @xcite by minlos and faddeev in 1961 and it has been exploited in a series of works by minlos and collaborators @xcite .    to our understanding , however , the issue of making the operator that in our notation reads @xmath346 a well - defined map on the space of charges @xmath347 , more precisely the issue on whether @xmath510 , was never addressed , nor was it noted that @xmath338 fails to map spherically symmetric functions of @xmath417 into @xmath245 ( see proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) and its proof ) .",
    "in fact , in all recent works @xcite the initial domain of @xmath338 is taken to be @xmath400 and hence , owing to proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) , in general @xmath511 consists of @xmath201-functions that can not be pulled back to @xmath512-functions by the inverse of @xmath376 .",
    "also , the ubiquitous statement in the above - mentioned literature , according to which each self - adjoint realisation in @xmath74 of the operator @xmath338 defined formally by identifies ( by general facts of the kren - viik - birman theory ) a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 that displays the tms asymptotics for the functions of its domain , need be made more precise in two crucial respects .",
    "first , one has to factor out the part of @xmath338 that acts on @xmath454 , the spherically symmetric functions , as we argued in proposition [ lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] and in the discussion that followed from it .",
    "second , even when @xmath338 is self - adjoint on the subspace of higher momentum charges , the corresponding densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath498 on @xmath392 is not necessarily self - adjoint and may in turn admit a multiplicity of self - adjoint extensions , as we observed in remark [ rem : selfadj_of_t_not_enough ] : only a self - adjoint extension @xmath460 of @xmath461 identifies , a la kren - viik - birman , the self - adjoint extension @xmath212 of @xmath8 .",
    "it remains therefore unclear how to relate the range of masses @xmath228 ( identified in @xcite ) in which @xmath338 , initially defined on @xmath513 , is self - adjoint or has a family of self - adjoint extensions on @xmath74 with the actual range of masses in which @xmath8 admits one or more self - adjoint extensions displaying the tms asymptotics .",
    "the fact that @xmath498 may be only symmetric on @xmath392 even when @xmath458 is self - adjoint on @xmath74 should account for a _",
    "larger _ range of masses in which @xmath8 has a multiplicity of tms - like self - adjoint extensions than the range in which @xmath338 has a multiplicity of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "it becomes of great interest now to re - read and understand , in terms of the general classification of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 provided by the kren - viik - birman theory , those results that produced tms self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 through an approach based on quadratic forms on hilbert space ( see @xcite and above all the recent work @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the quadratic form approach produces a single self - adjoint tms hamiltonian , or alternatively a family of self - adjoint tms hamiltonians , all extensions of @xmath8 , in a regime of masses that differs from what is known from the operator - theoretic approach and that coincides instead to what is found in the physical literature  see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.4 and proposition 2.2 ) , as well as the discussion around ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 1.17 ) ) .",
    "owing to the general picture of the self - adjoint extension theory , each such hamiltonian _ must _ be selected by a condition on the charges realised by a self - adjoint map on @xmath183 as in or , more generally , in .",
    "one should identify such a map and to compare it to its analog in the operator - theoretic approach .",
