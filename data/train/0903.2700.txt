    "in many elemental and compound semiconductors the motion of dislocations is controlled by peierls mechanism , i.e. it occurs through formation and migration of kink and anti - kink pairs .",
    "formation of the dislocation kink implies that various dislocation segments are located in the neighboring valleys of the periodic relief ( peierls potential ) of the lattice .",
    "motion of a dislocation in peierls relief is typically divided into three phases @xcite,@xcite : formation of kink pairs , migration of the kink and anti - kink in opposite directions and annihilation of kinks with different signs moving towards each other .",
    "it is well known , that various point defects ( impurity atoms , vacancies ) may impede the motion of the kink along the dislocation , i.e. they can act as pinning centers for the kink . in absence of lattice strain ,",
    "the kink can be held in the potential of the pinning centre , while the influence of a stationary force can detach it with certain probability .",
    "simultaneous effect of _ ac _ force can change ( increase or decrease ) the depinning probability .",
    "this effect was theoretically analyzed for the case , when a segment of the dislocation line overcomes the pinning centre @xcite .",
    "the importance of the studied problem is mostly due to the issue of recombination - enhanced motion of dislocations . in semiconductors",
    "the electronic features of the dislocation kink can influence the dislocation dynamics , provided that the multiphonon capture of the charge carriers by the kink is the significant mechanism of their recombination . during the multiphonon capture the lattice fluctuations localized in proximity to the capture centre are stimulated .",
    "subsequently , those fluctuations are dispersed through the entire crystal .",
    "thus , if recombination of charge carriers involves the dislocation kinks and happens through the thermal capture mechanism @xcite , then the released energy excites additional fluctuations which may stimulate the motion of dislocation ( similarly the photoplastic effect in semiconductors has been interpreted @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that for dislocation motion by the peierls mechanism , recombination basically contributes to the kink migration along the dislocation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recombination - enhanced motion of dislocations leads to extension of stacking faults in junction regions of bipolar and optoelectronic semiconductor devices and eventually results in the device degradation .",
    "thus , fluctuation - assisted depinning of the dislocation kink represents a single act that causes degradation of a semiconductor device .",
    "therefore , the aim of our work is exploring stochastic dynamics of the pinned kink under the influence of stationary and alternating ( harmonic ) forces . during the degradation process the dislocation is influenced by constant force stemming from internal tensions of the lattice , and the lattice fluctuations resulting from thermal recombination of carriers act as the _ ac _ force .",
    "kinks and anti - kinks on the dislocation are non - linear objects ( described by the sin - gordon ( sg ) soliton equation ) .",
    "therefore , the study of fluctuation - assisted depinning of the kink is a complicated task . simple approach to solving this problem is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dynamics of the kink is described by the equation of linear harmonic oscillator , which has the kink mass ascribed to it .",
    "this simplification allows to basically describe the process , however , for the purpose of further development of theory ( to fully account for the dependence of detachment probability on the kink parameters ) , it is necessary to correctly linearize the equation of motion .",
    "linearization of the equation of motion of the kink is possible through the use of perturbation theory developed by mclaughlin and scott @xcite .",
    "although this theory is based on some assumptions , it is actually the only reliable approach used in many studies for exploring the effect of external forces on the kink ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper , we will use a modification of above - mentioned perturbation theory developed in @xcite .",
    "when linearizing the equations of the kink motion in presence of _ ac _ force , this method enables to avoid complicated calculations used by the authors @xcite .",
    "let s consider a smooth kink on a dislocation ( directed along @xmath0 axis ) , i.e. the width @xmath1 significantly exceeds the height @xmath2 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the height @xmath3 of the kink ( equal to the inter - atomic distance ) represents a period of peierls relief .",
    "the kink is described by the transversal displacement @xmath4 of the dislocation , which is equal to zero when @xmath5 , and equal to @xmath2 when @xmath6 ( for anti - kink the reverse is true , i.e. @xmath7 decreases from @xmath2 to zero ) .",
    "the kink width corresponds to the range where @xmath8 .",
    "the smallness of the parameter @xmath9 is the criterion determining the smoothness of the kink , where @xmath10 is the peierls tension and @xmath11 is the shift module .",
    "the kink width relates to its height as per following equation @xcite :    @xmath12    therefore , the inequality @xmath13 denotes that the smooth kinks are being formed , as from ( [ eq1 ] ) we get the following : @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the string model of the dislocation is applicable for description of the kink .",
    "if the kink is located close to the pinning point , we can describe the interaction of the kink with the pinning centre ( located at the point @xmath15 on the dislocation ) by the following potential @xcite,@xcite : @xmath16 where parameter @xmath17 characterizes the interaction force .",
    "the multiplier @xmath18 in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) ensures that the pinning potential @xmath19 becomes equal to zero outside of the kink region .    as indicated in the introduction , we are interested in the kink dynamics under influence of _ dc _ and _ ac _ forces .",
    "the constant force @xmath20 stemming either from the internal pressure or the lattice external strain tends to move the kink away from the pinning centre .",
    "we will consider the _ ac _",
    "force @xmath21 , which emulates the lattice fluctuations originating due to the recombination process , as harmonic process .",
    "assuming that the energy of these forces , as well as dissipation due to friction are small compared to peierls potential , we can consider the influence of external forces as small perturbation relative to the undisturbed system . if the periodic potential has the following form ( commonly accepted for peierls relief @xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath22 then the dynamics of a string in this potential in case of existence of dissipation can be described by disturbed sg equation @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and the linear tension of the dislocation ( per unit length ) respectively .",

    "ac _ force is also in effect , we have to determine the equilibrium position considering only stationary force , meanwhile the _ ac _ force causes additional shift from the equilibrium .",
    "in other words , the equilibrium position is determined as the kink coordinate averaged on the time intervals larger than the period of the _ ac _ force .",
    "as it follows from equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , the following conditions correspond to the position of equilibrium : @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the root of the following equation : @xmath70 for the purpose of analytical examination of the kink oscillations around the point @xmath69 , we need to linearize the equation ( [ eq15 ] ) with respect to variable @xmath37 , assuming that the motion of the kink is non - relativistic ( @xmath71 . in absence of _ ac _ force , the kink makes damping oscillations around the pinning point , and eventually reaches the rest @xcite . if the kink is also subject to the influence of periodic force @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the amplitude of periodic force and @xmath74 is its frequency , then we need to analyze the following equations :    @xmath75 -\\frac{2a\\eta } { % \\pi w}v-\\frac{2\\mu } w\\ sech^2\\left ( \\frac{\\pi x}w\\right ) \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{% \\pi x}w\\right )   \\\\   \\frac{dx}{dt}=v \\end{array } { , }   \\label{eq16a}\\ ] ]    further linearization of the equation of motion of the kink is possible in case of small oscillations , assuming that the displacement is small compared to the kink width ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "note that the dependence of kink depinning probability on amplitude of _ ac _ force is analogous to the case of dislocation line ( string ) detachment from the oscillating stopper @xcite .",
    "the latter is true for dislocation motions in crystals with low peierls relief ( mostly in metals ) .",

    "this equation was used for exploring fluctuation - assisted depinning of the kink affected by _",
    "dc _ and _ ac _ forces . the obtained behavior of depinning probability on _ ac _ force amplitude is rather intriguing .",
    "the fact that this force can result either in decrease or increase of the probability ( depending on amplitude of the force and strength of the stopper ) means that recombination enhancement , modeled in our work by the harmonic _ ac _ force , can cause both softening and hardening of the crystal .",
    "it should be noted that both these effects were observed in ionic crystals with low peierls potential , where dislocation segments move ( under sufficiently high load ) without kink formation @xcite .",
    "however , in crystals with covalent and mixed covalent - ionic bonds , where the peierls mechanism of dislocation motion is prevalent , the softening is more common phenomena ( though the hardening was observed too , for example , in gaas crystals during investigation of photoplastic effect @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis shows , that hardening of peierls - type crystal due to _ ac _ excitation can occur in the case when the depinning of migrating kinks is the bottleneck of the process .",
    "it should be noted also that by introducing the _ ac _ force we simulated only the oscillations of the kink , while the pinning centre was assumed to be immobile .",
    "obviously , it is quite possible that the stopper can also be influenced by _",
    "ac _ excitation , particularly when this center is involved in thermal recombination process and , consequently , the heat release stimulates its oscillations .",
    "this can essentially affect the depinning probability @xcite .",
    "extension of our study to the case when both kink and stopper are subjected to _",
