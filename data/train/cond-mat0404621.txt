    "relaxors are a special class of ferroelectrics whose dielectric properties show diffusive and strongly frequency dependent phase transitions .",
    "pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzn ) is one of the prototype relaxors , which has attracted much attention due to its high piezoelectric properties when doped with pbtio@xmath2 ( pt )  @xcite .",
    "one unique property about relaxors is the appearing of local polarized nano - sized regions at the burns temperature @xmath8 , which is a few hundred degrees above the curie temperature @xmath9 .",
    "this was first suggested by burns and dacol  @xcite in interpreting their measurements on the optical index of several relaxor systems , including pzn and one of its close analog , pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pmn ) .",
    "the pnr was then extensively studied by diffuse scattering measurements .",
    "it was found that in pmn , the diffuse scattering starts to appear at around @xmath10  k , and increases monotonically with cooling  @xcite .",
    "similar results were also observed in pzn  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ newfig ] ) , where @xmath8 is much higher than that of pmn . in order to understand the nature of polarizations and correlations / shapes of the pnr in relaxors ,",
    "one of the most direct methods is to study the spatial distribution of the diffuse scattering intensity .",
    "recently , several neutron  @xcite and x - ray  @xcite diffuse scattering measurements have been carried out on various relaxor compounds to investigate the shapes of diffuse scattering intensity distributions in the reciprocal space around different bragg peaks",

    "the inset shows schematics of diffuse scattering intensity distributions in the ( hk0 ) plane , around the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) bragg peaks . ]",
    "however , the majority of these measurements were performed in a 2-d scattering plane , i.e. , probing the two - dimensional diffuse scattering distribution around bragg peaks .",
    "for example , measurements for pmn around ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) bragg peaks in the ( hk0 ) scattering plane ( see the schematic representation in fig .",
    "[ newfig ] ) suggest that the diffuse scattering intensity extend along the @xmath6 directions .",
    "but there is still ambiguity about whether or not these are projections of diffuse scattering intensities along other out - of - plane directions ( e.g. , projection of [ 111 ] direction ) onto the scattering plane .",

    "@xcite were the first to measure the out - of - plane x - ray diffuse scattering intensities of pmn around the ( 300 ) bragg peak .",
    "yet no systematic 3-d mapping of diffuse intensity distributions around different bragg peaks in these relaxor systems has been reported up to date .",
    "the lack of understanding of the diffuse scattering distribution in three - dimensions made it very hard to establish an effective and convincing model that can explain and predict accurately the diffuse pattern .    in this paper",
    ", we present high energy x - ray diffraction results , on the diffuse intensity distribution in three dimensions measured simultaneously around many bragg peaks of pzn-@xmath3pt single crystals .",
    "our results show that the diffuse scattering intensities extend along all six @xmath6 directions around most bragg points",
    ". however , for certain bragg peaks , one or more of the six @xmath6 type diffuse intensities are absent , because of the associated polarization ( atomic shift ) being perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "we suggest a simple phenomenological model , where @xmath7 polarizations are planar correlated in the \\{110 } planes .",
    "for example , [ 1@xmath120 ] polarization correlated in the ( 110 ) plane .",
    "the diffuse scattering patterns calculated based on this simple model are in good agreement with most previous and current results of measurements on diffuse scatterings from pnr in relaxors . details of this novel technique , our results , and the model calculations , are discussed in the next three sections .",
    "single crystals of pzn , pzn-4.5pt ( 4.5pt ) and pzn-8pt ( 8pt ) have been studied .",
    "the pzn single crystal is @xmath13",
    "mm@xmath14 is size , and was grown at the simon fraser university in canada ( the same crystal used in ref  ) .",
    "the 4.5pt single crystal is @xmath15",
    "mm@xmath14 in size and provided by trs ceramics .",
    "the 8pt crystal is a part ( @xmath16  mm@xmath14 ) of the original crystal previously studied by ohwada _",

    "the x - ray diffraction measurements were performed at x17b1 beamline of the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) . a monochromatic x - ray beam of 67 kev , with an energy - resolution of 10@xmath17 ( @xmath18e / e ) ,",
    "was produced by a sagittal - focusing double - crystal monochromator using silicon [ 311 ] reflection with both crystals in asymmetric laue mode  @xcite . in principle , with a four - circle x - ray diffractometer , one can reach any points in the reciprocal space , if allowed by geometry .",
    "however , in reality , most measurements on diffuse scatterings are performed in the `` zone '' . in other words ,",
    "the measurements are performed mostly in a plane - the diffraction plane , around certain bragg peaks .",
    "this is also the case for neutron diffuse scattering measurements .",
    "for example , measurements in the ( hk0 ) zone indicate that the measurements are performed in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath19-axis ( of the pseudocubic system ) , so that @xmath20 is fixed ( to 0 ) .",
    "this only probes two of the three dimensions of the diffuse scattering distribution around bragg peaks .",
    "certainly one can measure diffuse scatterings in other planes and essentially reconstruct a 3-d picture .",
    "but the beam time and efforts spent would usually be enormous .",
    "position sensitive detectors such as ccd detectors or image - plates have been used to perform monochromatic laue style measurements . in this type of measurements , scattering intensities in a plane ,",
    "i.e. , the ewald sphere , can be taken simultaneously , very similar to the case of electron diffraction measurements in transmission electron microscopies .",
    "this usually requires bragg points to be close to the ewald sphere . in some cases ,",
    "single crystal samples were oscillated while the image was taken .",
    "this is a very efficient way to obtain 2-d diffraction intensity distributions , but without any information , or with very coarse resolution , along the incident beam direction perpendicular to the image plane .",
    "one example of this type of measurements on relaxor systems is shown in ref .  .",
    "in our measurements , we were able to take advantage of the high energy ( 67  kev ) of the x - ray beam and a position sensitive ccd detector to perform 3-d x - ray diffuse scattering measurements in a very efficient manner .",
    "the focusing double - crystal monochromator set - up is also essential since it produces more than two orders of magnitude more photon flux than that of a conventional set - up .",
    "a schematic of the experiment set - up is shown in fig .",
    "the attenuation length of 67  kev x - rays in our samples are a few hundred microns , and the measurements are performed in a transmission mode . the reciprocal lattice and the radius of the ewald sphere ( the curve in fig .  [ fig0 ] ) are scaled from the real values in our measurements ( @xmath21    @xmath22  @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the incident x - ray beam was assumed to be along the reciprocal lattice [ 001 ] direction , and the [ 100 ] direction is pointing up . because of the high x - ray energy , and thus a large @xmath25 , the ewald sphere is almost flat , parallel to the ( 001 ) plane , perpendicular to @xmath19-axis at small @xmath11 .",
    "this makes it possible to reach close to many reciprocal lattice points in the ( hk0 ) zone simultaneously with one sample geometry .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that at larger @xmath11 values , the ewald sphere is not exactly cutting through the reciprocal lattice points . instead , the sphere cuts through the reciprocal lattice at none - zero @xmath20 values , as well as a small tilt angle to the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "for example , around the ( 200 ) reciprocal point , the ewald sphere is about @xmath26  r.l.u .",
    "away from the exact ( 200 ) position .",
    "so we are in fact measuring diffraction intensities at ( h , k,-0.09 ) around the ( 200 ) position on the ccd . by tilting the sample , therefore tilting the reciprocal lattice , the ewald sphere can cut the reciprocal lattice at different @xmath27 values as we need . with a few measurements taken at different sample tilts , the geometry of the diffuse scattering intensity distribution in three dimensions",
    "@xmath28 can be mapped out easily around selected bragg peaks . of course , in our measurements , the ewald sphere is curved not only vertically , but also horizontally so that the situation would be very similar around the ( 020 ) peak as the ( 200 ) peak .",
    "our measurements show that results from pzn , 4.5pt and 8pt crystals are qualitatively the same .",
    "the x - ray beam size used in the pzn and 4.5pt measurements were @xmath29  mm@xmath30 , and @xmath31  mm@xmath30 for the 8pt measurements .",
    "the @xmath32-resolution of our measurements is mainly limited by the x - ray beam size .",
    "the 8pt measurements with finer resolution show the features in a better detail , so in the next section we will focus on the results obtained using the 8pt sample .",
    "fig .  [ fig1_5 ] shows a ccd image taken at @xmath33  k , which is well below the ferroelectric transition temperature @xmath34  k for pzn-8pt  @xcite .",
    "this was measured in the ( hk0 ) zone , as shown by the schematics in fig .",
    "the x - ray beam is incident in the [ 001 ] direction , perpendicular to the ccd plane .",
    "[ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions are marked in the figure .",
    "the center of the image , which is the origin of the reciprocal lattice , is black because a central beam stop was used to block the direct beam . the tilt ( vertical ) and rotation ( horizontal ) of the sample has been aligned carefully so that the intensity around ( 100 ) , ( @xmath1200 ) are the same , as well as ( 010 ) and ( 0@xmath120 ) , to ensure that the ccd plane is as parallel to the ( 001 ) plane as possible .",
    "the counting time was 200 seconds , and we were able to measure very fine features simultaneously around many bragg peaks for @xmath11 as large as ( 2,2,0 ) .",
    "the rings in the image are powder rings from the be window in the high temperature displex , and the rest of the background is mainly due to air scattering .    at the four \\{100 }",
    "positions ( ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) , ( @xmath1200 ) , and ( 0@xmath120 ) ) , the ewald sphere is still close to the bragg peak ( @xmath35 r.l.u . ) .",
    "tails of the bragg peaks are picked up at these positions .",
    "in addition , diffuse intensities extending out from the \\{100 } bragg peaks along the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath120 ] directions are clearly observed . around the four \\{110 }",
    "peaks ( ( 110 ) , ( 1@xmath120 ) , ( @xmath1210 ) , and ( @xmath360 ) ) , we found that the diffuse scattering intensity is extending more in the transverse direction .",

    "when moving to larger @xmath11 positions , the ewald sphere starts to move further away from the ( hk0 ) plane in the reciprocal space , and the results reveal more interesting behavior . around the ( 200 ) position , @xmath37 r.l.u .",
    ", two spots are observed , split in the longitudinal direction along ( 100 ) . taking into account the curvature of the ewald sphere",
    ", the positions of the two spots can be calculated to be ( 2.09,0,-0.09 ) and ( 1.91,0,-0.09 ) .",
    "one can see that ( 2.09,0,-0.09 ) @xmath38 ( 1,0,-1 ) @xmath39 ( 2,0,0 ) , and ( 1.91,0,-0.09 ) @xmath40 ( 1,0,1 ) @xmath39 ( 2,0,0 ) .",
    "it is possible that those could be diffuse intensities extending out from the ( 200 ) peak in the [ 101 ] and [ 10@xmath12 ] directions .",

    "although these diffuse intensities are much weaker than the bragg peak intensity , they are also much broader in reciprocal space .",
    "this is why when the ewald sphere is further away from the bragg peak at ( 200 ) that that at ( 100 ) , the sharp bragg peak itself is not observed , but small traces of the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath120 ] type diffuse intensities still remain .        around the ( 210 ) position , in addition to the two spots split along ( 100 ) direction",
    ", we can see vaguely two weak spots split along the ( 010 ) direction too .",
    "this can be better seen at the ( 220 ) position , where the ewald sphere is further away from the ( hk0 ) plane , with @xmath42 r.l.u .",

    "similar to the two spots around ( 200 ) position , these four spots are possibly intensity rods extending out from the ( 220 ) peak , along the [ 101 ] , [ 10@xmath12 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 01@xmath12 ] directions , and cutting through the ewald sphere with a none - zero l value .        in order to verify this ,",
    "more measurements were performed by tilting the sample , so that diffuse scattering intensities at different @xmath27 values away from the bragg peaks can be studied . in fig .",

    "[ fig1_5 ] . when the sample was tilted by 2.6@xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) , the ( @xmath4600 ) bragg peak was actually right on the ewald sphere , and the ccd was saturated at that position .",
    "the vertical lines in the image are artifacts of the ccd saturation .",
    "the ( 200 ) peak , however , was moved further away from the ewald sphere .",
    "the sphere is therefore cutting at a larger @xmath42 around the ( 200 ) position .",
    "the two spots around ( 200 ) on the image clearly split further apart than that measured without sample tilt ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "they are roughly positioned at ( 2.18,0,-0.18 ) and ( 1.82,0,-0.18 ) .",
    "this confirms that these two spots are indeed results from ewald sphere cutting the intensity `` rods '' coming out from the ( 200 ) bragg peak along the [ 101 ] and [ 10@xmath12 ] directions .",
    "the sample tilt also moved the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 1@xmath120 ) peaks ( on the top part of the image ) further away from the ewald sphere .",
    "the fine features around these positions are also consistent with those around ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) .",
    "two longitudinally split spots at ( 100 ) , and four spots at ( 110 ) and ( 1@xmath120 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , these bragg points are simply too close to the ewald sphere for any fine features to be observed .",
    "the ( @xmath4620 ) and ( @xmath470 ) peaks ( on the bottom part of the image ) are , however , moved closer to the ewald sphere in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) then in ( a ) . here",
    "we see the four spots moving closer in , also in good agreement with what one would expect from the ewald sphere cutting intensity `` rods '' along [ 101 ] , [ 10@xmath12 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 01@xmath12 ] directions .",
    "one important fact to note is that around the ( 200 ) position , no intensity rods along the [ 011 ] and [ 01@xmath12 ] was observed .",
    "similarly , around the ( 020 ) position , no intensity rods along the [ 101 ] and [ 10@xmath12 ] directions are present . in x - ray and",
    "neutron scattering measurements , the diffuse scattering intensity resulting from correlated polarizations ( atomic shifts ) is proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the polarization vector .",
    "it is therefore evidential that the polarizations contributing to the [ 011 ] and [ 01@xmath12 ] type diffuse scatterings are perpendicular to @xmath50(1,0,0 ) .",

    "the bragg structure factor of pzn ( 220 ) and ( 200 ) are the same order of magnitude , yet the ewald sphere is further away from the bragg peak at ( 220 ) than ( 200 ) ( because of the larger @xmath11 ) . since the ( 200 ) bragg is not observed , neither should the ( 220 ) bragg .",
    "in fact , that `` peak '' is not the ( 220 ) bragg peak , but instead the diffuse scattering intensity coming out from the ( 220 ) peak along the [ 0@xmath121 ] direction ( perpendicular to the image plane ) .",
    "our results can establish unambiguously the geometry of the diffuse scattering intensities distributed in the reciprocal space . based on all the information obtained ,",
    "( i ) diffuse intensities are @xmath6 type rods around bragg peaks ; ( ii ) the intensities of different @xmath6 diffuse rods can vary between different bragg reflections ; ( iii ) at some bragg reflections , certain @xmath6 intensity rods are strong , and certain @xmath6 rods may even be absent , the 3-d distribution of the diffuse scattering intensity can be sketched in fig .",

    "the contrast and sharpness of the diffuse intensity rods have been exaggerated in order to illustrate the geometry in a simple and effective way .    in a quantitative way",

    "the intensity decreases slowly and monotonically with increasing t for all three compounds .",

    "phonon scattering intensities , on the other hand , are proportional to @xmath54 , when taking into account of the bose factor @xmath55 and the @xmath56 factor . in pzn  @xcite and pmn  @xcite , the zone center to phonon energy actually increases with cooling for @xmath57 .",
    "measurements on ta phonons at small @xmath32 in the same systems  @xcite also confirmed that the ta phonon modes behave normally below @xmath9 , i.e. , no significant broadening or softening .",

    "with increasing temperature , the phonon contributions will eventually increase and dominate .",
    "in fact , at 700  k , with the disappearance of the two spots around ( 200 ) position , we started to pick up intensities around ( 2,0,-0.09 ) , which is very likely coming from thermally activated phonons propagating in the [ 001 ] direction .    in the next two subsections",

    "furthermore , the polarizations should have the same periodicity as the lattice itself , because all these diffuse scattering intensities peak at the bragg positions , instead of forming some super - lattice peaks .",

    "this immediately leads to @xmath62[01@xmath12 ] .",
    "similar analysis can be used to derive the polarizations directions associated to all the six @xmath6 type diffuse scatterings .    in summary",
    ", we find that the real space structure corresponding to the @xmath6 rod - type diffuse intensity is \\{110 } planar correlations of in - plane @xmath7 polarizations .",
    "more specifically , there are polarizations along the [ 110 ] direction , correlated in the ( 1@xmath120 ) plane ; polarizations along the [ 1@xmath120 ] direction , correlated in the ( 110 ) plane ; polarizations along the [ 101 ] direction , correlated in the ( 10@xmath12 ) plane ; polarizations along the [ 10@xmath12 ] direction , correlated in the ( 101 ) plane ; polarizations along the [ 011 ] direction , correlated in the ( 01@xmath12 ) plane ; and polarizations along the [ 01@xmath12 ] direction , correlated in the ( 011 ) plane . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] provides a schematic illustration of one of these six planar correlations in real space .",
    "the x - ray diffraction measurements are less sensitive to the lighter atoms such as o , so we only illustrated possible motions of the heavier a ( pb@xmath63 ) and b ( zn@xmath63/nb@xmath64/ti@xmath65 ) site atoms .",
    "the motions of the a site and b site can be parallel ( acoustic ) or antiparallel ( optic ) , or a combination of the two .",

    "we used a product of lorentzian functions because an exponentially decaying correlation in real space , both in- and out - of - plane , has been assumed . for a square - function cut - off type correlation caused by a finite `` pancake '' shape , with thickness described by @xmath77 and diameter described by @xmath78",
    ", the reciprocal space intensity distribution will take the functional forms of gaussian functions instead .",
    "however , the shape of the diffuse scattering intensity will not change qualitatively .    in the simulation ,",
    "the in - plane correlation length was assumed as 20 lattices , 4 times larger than the out - of - plane correlation length ( 5 lattices - estimated from results of neutron diffuse measurements on pmn by xu _",
    "et al . _",
    "the contributions from the six \\{110 } planar correlations are weighed by the @xmath48 factor and summed up .",

    "the cross section of the 3-d diffuse scattering intensities gives the `` butter - fly '' diffuse pattern around ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) peaks , as well as the transverse [ 1@xmath120 ] type diffuse around the ( 110 ) peak . by moving away from the ( hk0 ) plane , with a small @xmath27 ,",
    "one starts to see the two spots split in the longitudinal direction around the ( 100 ) bragg peak due to the [ 101 ] and [ 10@xmath12 ] type diffuse intensities ; and four spots around the ( 110 ) bragg peak due to the [ 101 ] , [ 10@xmath12 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 01@xmath12 ] type diffuse intensities .",
    "a simulation of diffuse intensities in the ( hk@xmath27 ) plane , at different @xmath27 values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fighk0 ] .",
    "it is in good agreement with our measurements in the ( hk0 ) zone .",
    "similarly , one can also compare the simulation in the ( hkk ) zone to our measurements .",
    "we found that calculations based on this model can explain all of our results , as well as almost all of the previous results from x - ray  @xcite and neutron  @xcite diffuse scattering measurements on pmn and pzn-@xmath3pt .",
    "although it does not yet provide a clear physical picture on the origin of these correlated polarizations , it is very useful in calculating and predicting diffuse scattering distributions in these relaxor compounds .",
    "one interesting problem is that all of the three compounds in our measurements have rhombohedral type polarizations below @xmath9 .",
    "recent nmr measurements  @xcite on pmn also confirms the @xmath80 type polarization in the system . how do the @xmath80 type polarization and the correlated @xmath6 type polarization coexist in the same system ?",
    "in fact , our model is not in contradiction to the average @xmath80 type polarization .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath80 type polarization can be decomposed into three @xmath6 components .",
    "the average @xmath80 type polarization can be a result of global averaging of @xmath6 type polarized `` pancake '' entities .",
    "another possible scenario could be the following : when three different \\{110 } type `` pancakes '' ( e.g. , ( 110 ) , ( 011 ) , and ( 101 ) ) cross each other , the region shared by those three `` pancakes '' would have a combination of three @xmath6 polarizations - resulting in a @xmath80 type polarization .",
    "this shared region could be a @xmath80 polarized pnr , and the size of this region is then defined by the thickness of the three `` pancakes '' , i.e. , the out - of - plane correlation length , which is in the order of one to few nanometers ( a few lattice units ) .",
    "[ [ condensation - of - langle1bar10rangle - polarized - soft - optic - phonon - modes ] ] condensation of @xmath7 polarized soft optic phonon modes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ferroelectric polarizations are optic type distortions , associated with different atoms moving opposite to each other in the unit cell .",
    "it is well accepted that the pnr are formed from the condensation of the ferroelectric soft optic phonon mode .",
    "previous measurements show that the transverse optic ( to ) phonons become overdamped for @xmath81 for @xmath32 smaller than a certain value , called the `` waterfall '' wave - vector @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "the `` water - fall '' effect was observed for @xmath32 along both [ 001 ] and [ 011 ] directions  @xcite , and is believed to be intimately related to some length scales defined by the pnr .",
    "we can therefore suggest one possible origin of the rod - type diffuse scattering intensities .",
    "if the @xmath7 polarized optic phonon modes are particularly soft when propagating along the perpendicular @xmath6 directions , they can then condense into the @xmath6 type elastic diffuse intensities upon cooling .",
    "this occurs around @xmath83 , when the soft optic mode becomes overdamped and start to condense into static distortions .",
    "the shape of these static entities are then determined by the energy dispersion , i.e. , phonon velocity , of these @xmath7 polarized modes .",
    "take the [ 1@xmath120 ] polarized mode for example , it is likely to be softer along the [ 110 ] direction , i.e. , the optic phonon propagates with a smaller velocity along the [ 110 ] direction ; and harder in the ( 110 ) plane .",
    "when this mode becomes overdamped at @xmath8 , it then condenses accordingly , with a shorter length scale along the [ 110 ] direction than in the ( 110 ) plane , resulting in the ( 110 ) planar correlation of the [ 1@xmath120 ] polarizations , and the `` pancake '' shaped entity .    since pnr are results of soft to phonon condensation , why do the static diffuse scattering and soft optic phonons have different structure factors ?",
    "this discrepancy has been very well explained by hirota _",
    "_ with the phase - shifted pnr  @xcite model .",
    "they re - examined the atomic shift values derived from the neutron diffuse scattering measurements by vakhrushev _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on pmn , and found out that those values do not satisfy the center of mass condition .",
    "the mass center of the atoms in the pnr are displaced from the surrounding lattice along the polarization direction .",
    "this displacement is called the `` uniform - phase - shift '' , which is an acoustic type of atomic motion .",
    "the ferroelectric soft phonon mode only condense into the center - of - mass portion of the atomic shifts in the pnr , and therefore have different structure factors than the overall static atomic shifts in the pnr .    in our measurements",
    ", we were able to probe diffuse scattering intensities distributed in three dimensions around many bragg peaks simultaneously , from pzn-@xmath3pt single crystals .",
    "the shape of the diffuse scattering in the reciprocal space can be described as @xmath6 `` rod '' type intensities , resulting from \\{110 } planar correlations of @xmath7 polarizations in the real space , with the in - plane correlation length about a few to ten times larger than the out - of - plane correlation length . on the other hand , limited by the measurement resolution",
    ", we can not accurately determine the values of correlation length in and out of the correlation planes .",
    "in addition , we also do not have enough information to demonstrate whether the in - plane correlations are isotropic , or have certain preferences .",
