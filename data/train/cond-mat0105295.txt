    "there is currently much interest in quantum spin systems that exhibit frustration @xcite .",
    "this has been stimulated in particular by the study of the magnetic properties of the cuprates which become high - tc superconductors when doped .",
    "frustrated spin systems are known to have many interesting properties that are quite unlike those of conventional magnetic systems .",
    "the simplest model of such kind is the heisenberg spin chain with nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this model is well studied for @xmath2 @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been found that at @xmath3 the transition from the gapless state to the dimerized one takes place @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath4 corresponds to the well - known majumdar - ghosh model @xcite for which the exact ground state consists of dimerized singlets and there is a gap in the spectrum of excited states .",
    "less studied is frustrated spin models with competing interactions of ferro- and antiferromagnetic types .",
    "the physical interest for these models is connected with the study of the real compounds containing @xmath5 chains with edge - sharing @xmath6 units , like @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . in these compounds @xmath10 bond angle",
    "is nearly @xmath11 and the nearest - neighbor @xmath12 spin interaction is ferromagnetic according to goodenough - kanamori - anderson rule @xcite while the next - nearest - neighbor interaction is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the magnetic properties of these models are very different from those for models with pure antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "their ground state can be either ferromagnetic or singlet depending on the relation between the exchange integrals .",
    "one of the most interesting problems related to these models is the character of the transition between ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases .    of a special importance",
    "are models for which it is possible to construct an exact ground state .",
    "last years a considerable progress has been achieved by using so - called matrix - product ( mp ) form of the ground state wave function @xcite .",
    "the ground state wave function in the mp method is represented by trace of a product of matrices describing single - site states .",
    "the mp ground state has a structure of the type where each neighboring pair of spins has valence bond and , in fact , the mp form is a convenient representation of the valence bond states .",
    "its origin can be traced to the s=1 quantum spin chain with bilinear and biquadratic interactions @xcite . at present , various 1d spin models with the exact mp ground state is found @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a set of 1d and 2d spin-1/2 models with competing f and af interactions for which the singlet ground state wave function can be found exactly .",
    "this function has a special form expressed in terms of auxiliary bose operators .",
    "this form of the wave function is similar to the mp one but with infinite matrices .",
    "for special values of model parameters it can be reduced to the standard mp form .",
    "one of models is 1d quantum spin model describing the f - af transition point .",
    "spin correlations in the singlet ground state show giant spiral magnetic structure with period equals to the system size . on the antiferromagnetic side of this point",
    "the ground state can be either gapless with incommensurate spiral ground state @xcite or gapped with exponential decay of correlators @xcite .",
    "there are regions in the af phase where the magnetization as a function of magnetic field has jumps .",
    "the second considered model is the special case of the spin ladder with exchange integrals depending on one parameter .",
    "the exact ground state of this model is non - degenerated singlet with exponentially decaying spin correlations , and there is an energy gap .",
    "it will be shown that proposed form of exact wave function can be generalized to higher dimensions and two dimensionalal frustrated spin model with exact ground state can be constructed .",
    "it is known that the exact ground state of some 1d and 2d quantum spin models can be represented in rvb form @xcite .",
    "the rvb function in the fermi representation consists of homopolar configurations of electron pair .",
    "we generalize this two - particle function to include ionic states and denote it as `` singlet bond '' ( sb ) function .",
    "it is natural to try to find electronic models with exact ground state formed by sb functions in the same manner as for known spin models . in the paper",
    "some models of interacting electrons are presented .",
    "the hamiltonians of these models include the correlated hopping of electrons and spin interactions .",
    "one of the 1d models describes the transition point between the phases with and without an off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.2 we consider the frustrated spin chain at f - af transition point and describe the exact singlet ground state wave function as well as details of the spin correlation function calculations .",
    "we discuss the phase diagram of this model and its magnetic properties in the af phase . in sec.3",
    "the special spin ladder will be considered . two - dimensional frustrated spin model with the exact ground state is considered in sec.4 .",
    "sec.5 is devoted to the construction of the electronic models with sb type of wave function .",
    "the results of paper is summurized in sec.6 .",
    "let us consider @xmath13 spin chain with nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions given by the hamiltonian @xmath14 with periodic boundary conditions and even number of spins @xmath15 .",
    "this model is equivalent to a ladder model with diagonal coupling , so called a ` zigzag ' spin ladder .    if @xmath16 , then the ground state of ( [ a1 ] ) is ferromagnetic ( singlet ) at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 ( fig.[phase ] ) .",
    "the equation @xmath20 defines the line of transition points from the ferromagnetic to the singlet state , when energies of these states are zero .",
    "the model ( [ a1 ] ) along this line is given by the hamiltonian depending on the parameter @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) :    ( 8,5 )    @xmath23    with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) has a symmetry : its spectrum coincides with the spectrum of @xmath24 obtained by the following transformation @xmath25    this transformation permutes the factors at the first and the second terms in the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "thus , due to the symmetry it is sufficient to consider the range @xmath26 .",
    "first , we will show that the ground state energy of ( [ a2 ] ) is zero .",
    "let us represent the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) as a sum of hamiltonians @xmath27 of cells containing three sites @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 eigenvalues of each @xmath27 are @xmath31    we will present a singlet wave function which is the exact one of each @xmath27 with zero energy and , therefore , it is the exact ground state wave function of ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "this function has a form @xmath32 where @xmath33 here we introduced one auxiliary bose - particle @xmath34 ( the bose operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not act on spin states @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and the bose vacuum @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the direct product @xmath40 is the superposition of all possible spin configurations multiplied on the corresponding bose operators , like @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is a projector onto the singlet state .",
    "this operator can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are components of the total spin operator .",
    "the form of wave function ( [ a4 ] ) resembles the mp form , but with an infinite matrix which is represented by bose operators .",
    "therefore , we have to pick out the @xmath45 element of the matrix product instead of the usual trace in the mp formalism @xcite , because the trace is undefined in this case .",
    "the function @xmath46 contains components with all possible values of spin @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and , in fact , a fraction of the singlet is exponentially small at large @xmath49 .",
    "this component is filtered out by the operator @xmath42 .",
    "one can easily check that each cell hamiltonian @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 gives zero when acting on the corresponding part in wave function @xmath53  @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( one should take care of bose commutation relations ) . since each @xmath56 is a non - negatively defined operator , then @xmath53 is the exact ground state wave function of an open chain : @xmath57    as mentioned above , the function @xmath53 contains components of all possible values of total spin @xmath47 , and , therefore , the ground state of the open chain is multiply degenerate",
    ". however it can be proven @xcite that for the cyclic chain ( [ a3 ] ) only singlet and ferromagnetic components of @xmath46 have zero energy .",
    "therefore , for cyclic chain ( [ a3 ] ) @xmath58 is the singlet ground state wave function degenerate with the ferromagnetic state .    in particular case , @xmath59 , when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , another form of the exact singlet ground state wave function has been found in @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath62[k , l][m , n]\\ldots , \\label{a8}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 $ ] denotes the singlet pair and the summation is made for any combination of spin sites under the condition that @xmath64 .    the following general statements relevant to the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] )",
    "can be proved :    1 ) .",
    "the ground states of open chain described by ( [ a7 ] ) in the sector with fixed total spin @xmath47 are non - degenerate and their energies are zero .    2 ) . for cyclic chains",
    "the ground state in the @xmath65 sector is non - degenerate .",
    "the ground state energies for @xmath66 are non - zero .    3 ) .",
    "the singlet ground state wave function for open and cyclic chains coincide with each other .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we show the calculation of the spin correlation function in the symmetric case @xmath67 , when the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) takes the form @xmath68    since in this case there is one spin in elementary cell , the singlet ground state wave function @xmath58 can be written in a more simple and symmetric form : @xmath69 where @xmath70    one can check that wave functions ( [ b1 ] ) is the singlet ground state wave function with zero energy of hamiltonian ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the equivalence of wave functions ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ b1 ] ) follows from the non - degeneracy of ground state in the @xmath65 sector ( though functions @xmath53 in eqs.([b1 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) are different ) .",
    "now we calculate the norm and correlation function of the wave function @xmath58 ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "the norm of the singlet wave function @xmath58 is @xmath71 it is easy to check that the function @xmath46 has @xmath72 .",
    "then the projector @xmath42 in eq.([a6 ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the operators of the total spin .",
    "therefore , the norm takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the bose operators .",
    "thus the norm can be rewritten as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the bose vacuum of @xmath78 and @xmath35 particles and @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "let us introduce the auxiliary function @xmath84 : @xmath85 then @xmath86 the function @xmath84 can be easily found @xcite : @xmath87 integrating eq.([b11 ] ) over @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89 thus , finally , we arrive at @xmath90 here @xmath91 are the bernoulli numbers .    to calculate the spin correlators we need to introduce operators @xmath92",
    "then , the correlator @xmath93 will be defined by @xmath94 ( since @xmath95 ) .",
    "the expectation values in eq.([b14 ] ) can be represented as @xmath96 after a procedure similar to that for the norm and the integration over @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath97    it can be shown that in the thermodynamic limit , eqs.([b13 ] ) and ( [ b16 ] ) result in @xmath98 so , we reproduce the result obtained in @xcite that in the thermodynamic limit a giant spiral spin structure is realized , with the period of the spiral equal to the system size .    for the general case of model ( [ a2 ] )",
    "the calculation of the singlet ground state correlation functions can be performed by the similar way . the final result in the thermodynamic limit is @xcite : @xmath99    the latter equations mean that the long - range double - spiral order exists in the singlet ground state of hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "the pitch angle of each spiral is @xmath100 and there is a small shift angle @xmath101 between them .",
    "this shift angle reflects the fact that the unit cell contains two sites unless @xmath102 .",
    "we note that for special values of model parameter @xmath103 eqs.([b18 ] ) are not valid and spin correlations decay exponentially .",
    "these cases will be considered in sec.iii ( see eqs.([d4 ] ) ) .",
    "( 13,9 )    so far we considered the model ( [ a1 ] ) at the transition line from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state .",
    "now we discuss the phase diagram of this model .",
    "the exact ground state in the af phase is generally unknown .",
    "but it is interesting to note that the ground state on the line @xmath104 is the product of singlets on ladder diagonals ( 2,3 ) , ( 4,5 ) , ... as in the point @xmath105 on the transition line .",
    "the spectrum of ( [ a1 ] ) on the transition line is gapless .",
    "there are some regions on the plane ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) which were studied by different approximation methods .",
    "first let us consider behaviour of the system in the transition region near the ` symmetric ' point @xmath102 , where @xmath108    it would be mentioned that several copper oxide compounds are described by this model .",
    "these compounds contain @xmath5 chains and @xmath10 angle @xmath109 is near @xmath11 @xcite . in this case the usual antiferromagnetic super - exchange of two nearest - neighbor magnetic @xmath110 ions is suppressed and the exchange integral @xmath111 is negative .",
    "on the other hand the next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath106 between @xmath110 ions does not depend on @xmath109 and is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the estimation of the ratio @xmath112 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 gives @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively @xcite .",
    "though the model ( [ b19 ] ) is not exactly solvable in this case , its properties for @xmath115 can be studied .",
    "the consideration is based on the classical approximation . in this approximation",
    "the ground state spin structure is the spiral with the period @xmath116 and the ground state energy @xmath117 . using this approach the regular expansion in powers of the small parameter @xmath118",
    "can be developed @xcite .",
    "the second - order quantum corrections coincides with the classical energy .",
    "the calculation of higher orders of the perturbation theory in @xmath118 leads to infrared - divergent integrals and it is necessary to sum them in all orders to obtain the contributions proportional to @xmath119 , @xmath120 etc . in particular , the ground state energy calculated up to terms @xmath121 is @xmath122    the excitation spectrum is gapless and has a sound like behaviour @xcite .",
    "corresponding sound velocity is @xmath123 .",
    "the study of the dependence of the ground state energy @xmath124 on magnetization @xmath125 @xcite at @xmath115 shows that @xmath126 in a finite interval of values of @xmath127 .",
    "this implies the thermodynamic instability of the uniform state against the phase separation .",
    "this instability arises due to existence of multimagnon bound states .",
    "energy of @xmath128-magnon bound state ( @xmath129 ) is @xmath130 , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the energy of one - magnon state and @xmath133 is binding energy per magnon . for the model ( [ b19 ] )",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 . as a result",
    "the function @xmath124 has the form @xcite : @xmath136 at @xmath137 the system is in a two - phase state consisting of the ferromagnetic ( @xmath138 ) phase and the phase with @xmath139 . according to ( [ b20 ] ) the magnetization as a function of magnetic field @xmath140 has a jump from @xmath139 to @xmath138 ( metamagnetic transition ) at @xmath141 .",
    "these values @xmath142 and @xmath143 are close to those obtained in @xcite by extrapolation of finite cluster calculations .",
    "we stress that the jump of the magnetization exists if there are multimagnon bound states leading to the linear dependence of @xmath124 for some region of @xmath127 .    as for properties of the model",
    "far from the transition point @xmath20 , now - days there is no clear understanding @xcite , but we believe that the spectrum remains gapless . for the case",
    "@xmath144 this fact is predicted in @xcite . as for the jump in @xmath145",
    "it is unknown if it remains at @xmath146 .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite show that , at least , there is an abrupt increase of magnetization at some critical value of magnetic field .",
    "this perturbation theory can be generalized for the vicinity of any point on the transition line .",
    "it gives the similar properties of the system in the region @xmath147 , but it diverges at @xmath148 . at @xmath149 and @xmath148 the model ( [ a1 ] ) reduces to the alternating heisenberg chain studied in @xcite .",
    "the lowest excitation is the triplet and there is the gap . at @xmath150 and @xmath151 the model ( [ a1 ] ) reduces to the spin ladder with antiferromagnetic interactions along legs and the ferromagnetic interactions on rungs .",
    "it is evident that there is a gap at @xmath152 ( in this case the model is equivalent to the spin @xmath153 heisenberg chain ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the gap exists at @xmath154 .",
    "the region @xmath155 was studied by different methods in @xcite .",
    "the exact diagonalization of finite chains shows the gap @xmath156 in the excitation spectrum which is closed on the transition line .",
    "the presence of singlet - triplet gap is also confirmed by calculations with use of variational wave function in mp form ( [ d1 ] ) when all matrix elements are considered as variational parameters .",
    "the mp variational function gives very good accuracy @xcite , besides it gives exact ground state results for special points on the transition line and for the line @xmath157 ( dimer state ) .",
    "( 8,5 )    another important property of the model with @xmath155 is the existence of the multimagnon bound states for definite region of the values @xmath107 and @xmath106 .",
    "this region is shown on fig.1 .",
    "on the boundary of this region the multimagnon bound states disappear . as it was noted before the existence of the bound states leads to the linear regions on the dependence @xmath124 and to the metamagnetic transition .",
    "the dependence @xmath124 and @xmath145 was found using mp variational function .",
    "the calculations show that out of the bound state region the function @xmath145 is typical for the gapped antiferromagnet , i.e. it is monotonically increasing function ( fig.[mh ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath158 for @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 . in the bound state region",
    "the magnetization curve has the jump .",
    "it is interesting that inside the stripe @xmath162 this jump takes place immediately from zero to the maximal value @xmath163 ( fig.[mh ] ) at @xmath164 ( @xmath165 is a ground state energy per site ) .",
    "such behaviour of @xmath145 is explained by the fact that inside this stripe @xmath166 and the transition from the singlet state to the ferromagnetic one comes to pass through states with intermediate values of spin . in the bound state region outside the stripe",
    "the magnetization curve has a form as shown on fig.([mh ] ) . in this case the critical field @xmath167 .",
    "thus , summarizing all above , we expect that the phase diagram of the model ( [ a1 ] ) has the form shown in fig.([ph2 ] ) .",
    "let us consider more general spin ladder model , for which ` zigzag ' model ( [ a2 ] ) is a particular case .",
    "so , we consider the cyclic ladder model containing @xmath15 spins @xmath13 ( fig.[lad ] )",
    ". the proposed form of wave function ( [ a4 ] ) can be generalized for a ladder model as follows : @xmath168 where each @xmath169 corresponds to the @xmath170th rung of the ladder : @xmath171 where @xmath21 and @xmath172 are two parameters of the model .",
    "it is obvious that the ladder wave function ( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) reduces to the original function ( [ a4 ] ) at @xmath173 .",
    "now we will construct the hamiltonian for which @xmath174 is the exact ground state wave function .",
    "this hamiltonian describes two - leg @xmath13 ladder with periodic boundary conditions ( fig.[lad ] ) and can be represented in a form    ( 8,6 )    @xmath175    where @xmath176 describes the interaction between neighboring rungs .",
    "the spin space of two neighboring rungs consists of six multiplets : two singlet , three triplet and one quintet . at the same time",
    ", one can check that the product @xmath177 contains only three of the six multiplets of each pair of neighboring rungs : one singlet , one triplet and one quintet .",
    "the specific form of the singlet and triplet components present in the product @xmath177 depends on parameters @xmath21 and @xmath172 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath176 can be written as the sum of the projectors onto the three missing multiplets with arbitrary positive coefficients @xmath178 : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the projector onto the missing multiplets in the corresponding cell hamiltonian .",
    "the wave function ( [ c1 ] ) is an exact wave function of the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath176 with zero energy , because @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the excitation energies of the corresponding multiplets .",
    "so , @xmath53 is the exact ground state wave function with zero energy for the total hamiltonian of an open ladder @xmath183 @xmath184    since the function @xmath53 contains components with all possible values of total spin @xmath47 ( @xmath185 ) , then the ground state of open ladder is multiple degenerate .",
    "but for a cyclic ladder ( [ c3 ] ) only singlet and ferromagnetic components of @xmath53 have zero energy .",
    "therefore , for a cyclic ladder @xmath58 is a singlet ground state wave function degenerated with ferromagnetic state .",
    "besides , all the statements given for ` zigzag ' model ( [ a2 ] ) are valid for ladder model ( [ c3 ] ) .    since the specific form of the existing and missing multiplets in the wave function ( [ c1 ] ) on each two nearest neighbor spin pairs depends on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath172 , the projectors in ( [ c4 ] ) also depend on @xmath21 and @xmath172 .",
    "each projector can be written in the form @xmath186 and this representation is unique for a fixed value of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath172 .    substituting the above expressions for the projectors into eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) , we obtain the general form of the hamiltonians @xmath176 .",
    "inasmuch as the hamiltonians @xmath176 have the same form for any @xmath170 , it suffices here to give the expression for  @xmath187 : @xmath188 where @xmath189 and all exchange integrals depend on the model parameters and the spectrum of excited states @xmath190 as follows : @xmath191 ( one should keep in mind that only positive @xmath192 can be substituted to these expressions ) .",
    "the model ( [ c10 ] ) has evident symmetry : the change of sign of @xmath172 is equivalent to renumbering of sites @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , we will consider only the case @xmath194 .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian @xmath176 contains all the terms presented in ( [ c8 ] ) , but we can simplify it by setting , for example , @xmath195 and solving equations ( [ c10 ] ) for @xmath196 . all @xmath197 turn out to be positive in this case for any @xmath21 and @xmath172 except two lines @xmath198 and @xmath199 , where ground state is multiple degenerated .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath176 in this case takes the form @xmath200",
    "@xmath201 ^ 2}{y^2}-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the calculation of the norm of ( [ c1 ] ) and the singlet ground state correlation functions can be performed in the similar way to the corresponding calculations for the case @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , we give here the final result for spin correlation functions at @xmath203 @xmath204 these equations mean that the spiral on each leg with pitch angle @xmath205 is formed and the shift angle between spirals on the upper and the lower legs is @xmath206 . at @xmath198 , when spins on each rung form a local triplet , the shift angle vanishes and the spirals on both legs become coherent ( we note that the shift angles in eqs.([b18 ] ) and ( [ c13 ] ) are defined in a different way ) .",
    "thus , there is just one full rotation of the spin over the length of the ladder , independent of the size of the system and for fixed @xmath207 at @xmath203 two spins on the ladder are parallel .",
    "we emphasize that the spin correlation function @xmath208 does not depend on the choice of @xmath197 for a fixed parameters @xmath209 , because the ground state wave function of the three - parameter set of hamiltonians ( [ c10 ] ) is the same .",
    "there are special values of the parameter @xmath21 for which eqs.([c13 ] ) are not valid . for cases of integer or half - integer @xmath210 , which correspond to the special cases of the model ( [ c10 ] ) , in eq.([c2 ] ) one can easily recognize the maleev s boson representation of spin @xmath211 operators @xcite : @xmath212 generally , the wave functions ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) resemble mp form but with an infinite matrices represented by the bose operators .",
    "however , in accordance to maleev s representation in the special cases the infinite matrices formed by the bose operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be broken off to the size @xmath213 and wave function ( [ c1 ] ) is reduced to the usual mp form @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the @xmath216 matrix describing states of spin pair on corresponding rung of the ladder .",
    "singlet state matrix is @xmath217 where @xmath218 is unit matrix and @xmath219 is the singlet state .",
    "triplet state matrix @xmath220  is expressed by clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath221 as follows : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the triplet state with @xmath224 .",
    "exact calculation of the correlators in the thermodynamic limit is performed using standard transfer matrix technique and results in @xmath225 where @xmath226    in the particular case of zero singlet weight , @xmath198 , when spins on each rung form a local triplet , correlation functions ( [ d4 ] ) coincide with those obtained in @xcite .    according to eqs.([d4 ] )",
    "the spin correlations have an exponential decay and the correlation length @xmath227 is @xmath228 in particular , for special points of ` zigzag ' model ( [ a2 ] ) with @xmath229 and @xmath230 the correlation length @xmath231 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath227diverges when @xmath232 or @xmath233 . in these cases",
    "the singlet ground state has collinear or stripe spin structure , i.e. spin - spin correlations are ferromagnetic along legs and antiferromagnetic between them ( fig.[stripe ] ) , with a magnetic order @xmath127 : @xmath234 when @xmath173 ( the ` zigzag ' model ) the magnetic order is equal to the classical value @xmath138 .",
    "( 8,6 )    we note that the wave function ( [ c1 ] ) show double - spiral ordering for all values of @xmath21 and @xmath172 excluding the special lines @xmath210 .",
    "the crossover between spiral and stripe states occurs in the exponentially small ( at @xmath203 ) vicinity of the special lines .",
    "generally , the excitation spectrum of model ( [ c3],[c11 ] ) can not be calculated exactly .",
    "it is clear that this spectrum is gapless because , for example , the one - magnon energy is @xmath235 at @xmath203 .",

    "the correlation functions in the ground states with @xmath483 and @xmath487 for the half - filling case coincide with each other and at @xmath422 they are : @xmath488 the existence of the odlro immediately follows from the latter equations .",
    "the correlation functions in the ground state ( [ m6 ] ) have similar forms as in eqs.([m4 ] ) : @xmath489 the giant spiral ordering in the last equation implies the existence of the odlro and , therefore , the superconductivity @xcite in the ground state ( [ m6 ] ) .",
