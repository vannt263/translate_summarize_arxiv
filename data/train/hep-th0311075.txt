    "the subject of three - body ( and , in general , @xmath5-body ) relativistic phase space is as old as the hills and one might well think that all that there is to know is known about it . in numerical and experimental terms",
    "this is indeed true : for a long time dalitz plots  @xcite have been routinely used in picturing data and they prove extremely helpful for picking out resonant intermediate states of particular spin by their preferential population of the plots . in the absence of any amplitude modulation by resonances or otherwise , the plots are at their blandest as they just represent three - body phase space",
    ".    one of the first comprehensive references on this subject is the paper by almgren  @xcite . in his normalization ,",
    "the integral over the @xmath5-particle phase space is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total momentum . from now on",
    ", we will frequently use the notation @xmath8 , since usually it is easy to distinguish it from the cases when the four - dimensional vector @xmath7 is meant . as a rule",

    ", we will denote @xmath11 ( this is the original almgren s notation ) .",
    "more details about integrals in other dimensions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the rest of this paper .",
    "worth mentioning is that @xmath9 is easy to work out for odd values of @xmath12 , whereas considering even values of @xmath12 brings in elliptic functions and is more difficult .    for kinematical reasons ,",
    "it is clear that the results for the integrals  ( [ def_i_n ] ) have no physical meaning if the absolute value of the momentum @xmath7 is less than the sum of the masses .",
    "therefore , in what follows we will imply that all results for @xmath9 are accompanied by @xmath13 , without writing this theta function explicitly . in refs .",
