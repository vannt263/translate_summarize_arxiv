    "the largest disagreement is the irs  13e cluster ( model / data @xmath07 ) , indicating that its wc and wn winds should be revised downward to agree with the x - ray observations .",
    "we compute the thermal x - ray properties of the galactic centre from hydrodynamic simulations of the 30 wr stars orbiting within 12of sgra@xmath1@xcite .",
    "these simulations use different feedback models from the smbh at its centre .",
    "chandra _ x - ray visionary program observations @xcite provide an anchor point for these simulations , so we compare the observed 12@xmath21249 kev image and the 25ring spectrum with the same observables synthesized from the models .",
    "remarkably , the shape of the model spectra , regardless of the type of feedback , agree very well with the data .",
    "this indicates the hot gas around sgra@xmath1is primarily from shocked wr wind material , and that the velocities of these winds are well constrained .",
    "the x - ray flux strongly depends on the feedback mechanism ; greater smbh outflows clear out more wr - ejected material around sgra@xmath1 , thus decreasing the model x - ray emission . over 49",
    "kev in energy and 25 in projected distance from sgra@xmath1(excluding irs  13e and the nearby pwn ) , the x - ray emission from all models is within a factor of 2 of the observations , with the best model agreeing to within 10% ; this is the medium - strength feedback model ob5 , which has an smbh outburst of @xmath8@xmath9yr@xmath10 and @xmath11=5000kms@xmath10 from 400 to 100yr ago .",
    "therefore , this work shows that the smbh outburst is required for fitting the x - ray data , and by extension that the outburst still affects the current x - ray emission around sgra@xmath1 , even though it ended 100yr ago ."
