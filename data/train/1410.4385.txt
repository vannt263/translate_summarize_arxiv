    "there exist a wide class of literature dealing with the problem of approximate solutions to nonlinear equations with various different methodologies , called the perturbation methods .",
    "but almost all perturbation methods are based on small parameters so that the approximate solutions can be expanded in series of small parameters .",
    "its basic idea is to transform by means of small parameters , a nonlinear problem of an infinite number of linear subproblems into an infinite number of simpler ones .",
    "the small parameter determines not only the accuracy of the perturbation approximations but also the validity of the perturbation method .",
    "there exists some analytical approaches , such as the harmonic balance method [ 1 ] , the krylov - bogolyubov - mitropolsky method [ 2 ] , weighted linearization method [ 3 ] , perturbation procedure for limit cycle analysis [ 4 ] , modified lindstedt - poincare method [ 5 ] , artificial parameter method [ 6 ] and so on .    in science and engineering ,",
    "there exists many nonlinear problems , which do not contain any small parameters , especially those with strong nonlinearity .",
    "he [ 7 , 8 ] developed the homotopy perturbation method ( hpm ) for solving linear , nonlinear , initial and boundary value problems by merging the standard homotopy and the perturbation .",
    "the hpm was formulated by taking full advantage of the standard homotopy and perturbation methods . in this method",
    "the solution is given in an infinite series usually converging to an accurate solution .",
    "inspired and motivated by the ongoing research in the area of bioscience involving mainly ecological and eco - epidemiological systems , we apply hpm for solving three coupled nonlinear equations representing a prey - predator model system with disease in prey species only .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , hpm has been illustrated .",
    "based on the hpm , the approximate solutions of three coupled nonlinear equations are obtained in section 3 .",
    "finally , we have drawn the conclusion in section 4 .",
    "to illustrate the basic ideas of hpm for solving nonlinear differential equations , he[7 , 8 ] considered the following nonlinear differential equation : @xmath0 with the boundary conditions @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a general differential operator , @xmath3 is a boundary operator , @xmath4 is known anaclitic function , @xmath5 is the boundary of the domain @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes differentiation along the normal vector drawn outwards from @xmath8 .",
    "the operator @xmath2 can generally be divided into two parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath9 is linear and @xmath10 is nonlinear .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) can be written as @xmath11 he [ 7 , 8 ] constructed a homotopy as follows : @xmath12 or , @xmath13    where @xmath14\\to r$ ] . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) ,  @xmath15 $ ] is an embedding parameter and @xmath16 is the first approximation that satisfies the boundary condition .",
    "the changing process of @xmath17 from zero to unity is just that of @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . in topology , this is called deformation .",
    "the terms @xmath21 and @xmath20 are called homotopy . according to the homotopy perturbation method",
    ", the parameter @xmath17 is used as a small parameter and the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be expressed as a series in @xmath17 in the form @xmath22 when @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) corresponds to the original one , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) the approximate solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath24 the convergence of the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) has been discussed by he[7 , 8 ] .",
    "we consider three coupled nonlinear equations which describe a prey - predator model , consisting with two prey and a predator species .",
    "we also consider an infectious disease , which is transmissible among the prey species only to give the model realism , interested readers are referred to [ 9 - 11 ] .",
    "let us assume @xmath25 denotes susceptible prey population , @xmath26 denotes infected prey population , and @xmath27 denotes predator population at any time .",
    "the model under consideration is given by the following system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the growth rate of the prey population , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the searching efficiency of the predators for the susceptible prey and infected prey respectively , similarly @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the conversion factors for the susceptible prey and infected prey respectively consumed by the predators .",
    "@xmath37 is the carrying capacity of the environment for the total ( susceptible + infected ) prey population , the disease spreads horizontally with mass action incidence rate @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the mortality rate of infected prey population including disease related death , @xmath40 is the mortality rate of the predator population .",
    "all the parameters are non negative .",
    "the predators eat both susceptible and infected prey at different rates , since the susceptible prey more likely escapes from an attack , thus @xmath41 .",
    "it is to be noted that the value of the system parameter ` e ' is a proper fraction for most of the realistic prey - predator interactions . for application of hpm , now we write eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])-([eq10 ] ) as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and we also consider @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 when @xmath23 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq12])-([eq14 ] ) become the approximate solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq15])-([eq17 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 here , boundary conditions are @xmath50 and @xmath51    for without perturbation , the eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])-([eq10 ] ) can be written as @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 whose solutions are @xmath55 .    with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , one can write the eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])-([eq10 ] ) as follows : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 substituting the values of @xmath59 and @xmath27 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq12])-([eq14 ] ) and equating the coefficients of embedding parameter @xmath17 , we get coefficient of @xmath60 as @xmath61 equating the coefficient of @xmath62 we have @xmath63 and coefficient of @xmath64 as    @xmath65    etc . eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])-([eq10 ] ) can easily determine the components @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 so , it is possible to calculate more components in the decomposition series to enhance the approximation .",
    "consequently , one can recursively determine every term of the series @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 and hence the solutions @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is readily obtained in the form of a series like @xmath73 where the constants @xmath74to@xmath75 are given by @xmath76 the constants @xmath77 to @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 and the constants @xmath80to@xmath78 are given by @xmath81    putting the different values of parameters @xmath82 we obtained the approximate solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])-([eq10 ] ) . to explain our results , we have drawn figures of @xmath83 and @xmath27 versus time for different parameters and initial condition values . from these figures",
    ", we see that the exact numerical results and the results obtained using hpm are nearly same .",
    "this system of three coupled differential equations ( 3.1)(3.3 ) plays an important role in biosystems .",
    "the basic goal of this paper is to study this model using hpm .",
    "the goal has been achieved by deriving solutions using few iterations only .",
    "the qualitative results of the present studies have been compared with the results obtained by numerical computation using @xmath84 as evident from the fig . 1 and reveal that hpm is very effective and convenient for solving non - linear differential equations .",
    "hope that with the help of these solutions , one can study qualitative and quantitative behaviors of realistic prey - predator interactions .",
