    "we assume that the functions @xmath118 , @xmath145 , @xmath16 , and @xmath111 are all finite and continuous at @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath60 is a singular coordinate at the horizon , we should not assume that the derivatives of these functions with respect to @xmath60 are continuous , or even finite , at @xmath136 .",
    "instead , we require only that @xmath146 vanishes at the horizon and that @xmath147 and @xmath148 diverge less rapidly than @xmath149 does .",
    "we assume that the leading singularities of these quantities near the horizon can be approximated by ( not necessarily integer ) powers of @xmath150 , although we allow for the possibility that both the power and the coefficient of the leading term may be different on opposite sides of the horizon .    given these assumptions , eqs .",
    "( [ ueqn ] ) and ( [ heqn ] ) imply that the matter fields at the horizon , which we denote by @xmath151 and @xmath152 , must lie at one of the stationary points of @xmath53 that were enumerated in sec .",
    "once these are specified , @xmath136 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ meqn ] ) , which reduces to @xmath153    the monopole solutions without horizons were solutions to a boundary value problem with conditions imposed at @xmath22 and @xmath154 .",
    "the existence of the extremal horizon imposes three more conditions ( on the values of @xmath118 , @xmath145 , and @xmath16 at @xmath129 ) and thus leads to a pair of boundary value problems , one for the interval @xmath155 and one for @xmath156 , that must be solved simultaneously .",
    "the interior problem has three boundary conditions at the origin and three at the horizon , for a total of six , while the exterior has two at spatial infinity and three at the horizon , giving five in all .",
    "a standard approach to such problems is to look for a family of solutions obeying the conditions at one of the boundaries .",
    "if these can be shown to depend on @xmath157 adjustable parameters , integration of these solutions will ( assuming no singularities intervene ) give an @xmath157-parameter family of solutions in the neighborhood of the other boundary .",
    "generically , a necessary , although not sufficient , condition for a solution is that @xmath157 be greater than or equal to the number of conditions imposed at the second boundary .",
    "thus , at first thought it would seem that , given a suitable set of values for @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath136 , we would need a two - parameter family of solutions as @xmath158 to solve the exterior boundary value problem and a three - parameter family for @xmath159 to solve the interior problem .",

    "we may therefore view @xmath32 as an extra adjustable parameter , and need only require the existence of two - parameter families of solutions on both sides of the horizon .",
    "the nonanalyticity at the horizon allows us to choose the parameters on the two sides independently .",
    "there are several caveats .",
    "first , the presence of the appropriate number of adjustable parameters at the horizon does not guarantee the existence of a solution .",

    "we find two quite distinct behaviors . in the low-@xmath105 regime , with weak higgs self - coupling , the critical solution is identical to the extremal reissner - nordstrom solution outside the horizon . inside the horizon ,",
    "the matter fields are smooth and nonsingular , as is @xmath16 . however , because of the step function behavior of @xmath89 at the horizon , @xmath334 vanishes identically in the interior .",
    "the associated singularity at the horizon means that an observer falling freely into a critical or near - critical monopole will experience the strong tidal forces characteristic of a horowitz - ross naked black hole .",
    "one might speculate that these singularities were inextricably associated with the transition from a nonsingular monopole to a black hole spacetime and were independent of the details of the higgs potential .",
    "however , our solutions in the large-@xmath105 regime show that this is not the case .",
    "for these , the critical solution has nontrivial matter fields outside the horizon , and thus is an extremal black hole with hair .",
    "although the metric functions are still nonanalytic at the horizon , their singularities are much weaker and do not lead to large tidal forces .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is itself quite interesting , and is in many ways reminiscent of a first - order transition . for a range of values of @xmath105 on both sides of the transition point",
    ", @xmath16 for the critical solution has two distinct minima . for values of @xmath105 below the transition , @xmath16 is positive at the inner minimum and has a double zero at the outer minimum at @xmath109 . the inner minimum moves downward with increasing @xmath105 until , at the transition point",
    ", there are two distinct but degenerate minima , with @xmath16 vanishing at both . as @xmath105 is increased further , the outer minimum moves upward while the inner minimum remains a zero of @xmath16 .",
    "while this implies a discontinuity in the horizon area , the mass of the black hole is continuous . in terms of black hole thermodynamics",
    ", this corresponds to a discontinuity in the entropy but ( because these are zero temperature black holes ) a free energy that is a continuous function of @xmath105 .",
    "our focus in this paper has been on the behavior of the monopole solutions as the higgs expectation value is increased to its critical value .",
    "it seems natural to ask how these solutions evolve if @xmath32 is increased still further .",
    "actually , there is a bifurcation at this point . if one requires that the solutions remain well - behaved at spatial infinity , the solutions with @xmath335 are black hole solutions with singularities at @xmath22 . in the low-@xmath105 regime , these are simply nonextremal reissner - nordstrom black holes , of varying mass , with no dependence on either @xmath134 or @xmath105 .",
    "( there are also magnetically - charged black holes with hair in this regime ; however , they are not continuously connected to our critical solutions . ) in the high-@xmath105 regime , the counting of boundary conditions suggests that , for given values of @xmath134 and @xmath105 , the continuation of the external solution is a one - parameter family of black holes with hair .",
    "alternatively , one can require that the fields remain nonsingular at @xmath22 and continue the interior solution . because there are three boundary conditions at the origin , compared to the two at spatial infinity , this gives solutions with nonsingular interiors bounded by horizons that are uniquely determined by specifying @xmath134 and @xmath105 .",
    "the behavior of the metric near the horizon is similar to that found when de sitter spacetime is written in static coordinates , suggesting a cosmological interpretation for these solutions .",
    "we suspect that , possibly with a suitably modified higgs potential , these may give rise to topological inflation @xcite .",
    "finally , having studied these self - gravitating monopoles and obtained an understanding of their approach to criticality , we can use these solutions as tools for investigating the transition from a nonsingular spacetime to one containing blackhole horizons .",
    "we will describe this elsewhere .",
    "we wish to thank dieter maison , gary horowitz , and mark trodden for useful conversations .",
    "this work was supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "in section  vi we noted that a discrepancy appears between the analytic argument that low-@xmath105 type critical solutions can only exist when @xmath336 and the numerical observation that this type of critical solution persists when @xmath144 .",
    "we discuss here the details of our investigation that lead us to believe that this discrepancy is not a numerical artifact .",
    "recall that the transition between the high and low-@xmath105 type critical solutions is reminiscent of a first - order phase transition .",
    "the metric function @xmath93 for a regular monopole solution near criticality with @xmath105 near the transition value possesses two minima , one near the extremal reissner - nordstrom radius , @xmath37 , the other in the core of the monopole , @xmath112 .",
    "as @xmath134 is increased ( for a fixed @xmath105 ) , one of these minima becomes a horizon , and a critical solution is attained .",
    "if @xmath16 at the inner minimum becomes zero first , then we have a high-@xmath105 type critical solution ; when @xmath16 for the outer minimum touches down first , we have low-@xmath105 type solution .",
    "let us examine each of these minima separately for regular solutions near criticality in this transition region .",
    "the inner minimum for the types of solutions under consideration varies rapidly with both @xmath134 and @xmath105 , so one can identify very precisely when such a minimum becomes a horizon .",
    "moreover , the field variables and their derivatives are well - behaved near this radius , and the numerical solutions here are robust and insensitive to variations in the numerical algorithm .",
    "different numerical implementations of the field equations leads to differences in @xmath135 of a few parts in @xmath337 for a high-@xmath105 type critical solution .",
    "the numerical and analytic results could be reconciled if ( 1 ) the high-@xmath105 type solutions persisted down to lower @xmath105 into a region where @xmath336 and ( 2 ) the identification of the outer minimum as a zero of @xmath16 for the critical solutions in this region was a result of numerical error .",
    "we can address the first issue by using a trick . in sec .",
    "iv we learned that critical solutions solve separate interior and exterior boundary value problems .",
    "hence , we can determine @xmath135 as a function of @xmath105 for the high-@xmath105 type solutions by just solving the field equations from the origin to the horizon , ignoring the exterior region from the horizon out to spatial infinity . by using an algorithm similar to that described in sec .",
    "iii , we find the family of critical solutions represented by the dashed line in the inset of figure  [ fig : crit ] .",
    "these solutions have high-@xmath105 type horizons but are not asymptotically flat at spatial infinity ; however , if there were an asymptotically flat critical solution with the same value of @xmath105 , it would have the same @xmath135 as these solutions .",
    "this dashed line crosses @xmath338 when @xmath339 .",
    "thus to be consistent with the analytic results , the transition value between low and high-@xmath105 critical solutions _ must _ occur for @xmath340 ( rather that at the value of @xmath341 indicated by our numerical results ) . again , this result appears to be numerically robust to a few parts in @xmath337 .      according to the previous discussion ,",
    "the ability to reconcile numerical and analytic results now depends on the sensitivity of the outer minimum , the one near @xmath37 , to numerical error . from the inset in figure  [ fig : crit ]",
    ", we see that in order for @xmath342 , our values for @xmath135 for the low-@xmath105 type critical solutions must be in error ( too low ) by approximately @xmath343 .",
    "a priori , such an error is certainly plausible . at this minimum , the solutions near criticality vary sluggishly with @xmath134 and @xmath105 .",
    "the spatial derivatives of field variables are large at this radius , and indeed are expected to be singular if the outer minimum becomes a horizon .",
    "it is here that we are most susceptible to numerical errors .    as we discussed in sec .",
    "iii , discretized versions of eqs .",
    "( [ ueqn])([meqn ] ) are implemented in our numerical algorithm to identify static monopole solutions . in order to probe the robustness of the algorithm and the confidence with which we can treat these solutions , different implementations of the discretization",
    "were examined and compared . in particular , we focus on eqs .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) at @xmath346 and @xmath347 . the curves in fig .  [ fig : app ] do not extend into the region where @xmath348 since this is @xmath349 $ ] and our solutions break down .",
    "( for these calculations we used @xmath350 . ) indeed we find no stable solutions at all in this regime ; however , we expect this effect is an artifact of the discretization .",
    "what happens for this very small @xmath116 is beyond the ability of our resources to probe .",
    "nevertheless , the extrapolated difference in @xmath135 between the two numerical implementations were on the order @xmath351 .",
    "other similar variations in the numerical algorithm were tried , and analogous results are found . moreover , varying the spatial discretization size also yielded differences in @xmath135 on the order @xmath351 . thus , numerical error does not seem to provide the @xmath352 needed to account for the discrepancy between the numerical observations and the analytic results . to illustrate the scope of the discrepancy needed",
