    "the top quark condensation is an attractive idea that explains the electroweak symmetry breaking in the absence of fundamental scalar bosons , and gives an understanding of that the top quark mass is of the order of the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "bardeen , hill and lindner ( bhl ) have proposed an interesting scenario for the top condensation  @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) equations play an important role , and the composite nature of the higgs particle is reflected in the boundary conditions for the coupling constants of the standard model , namely , the compositeness conditions of bhl .",
    "the usual standard model is considered to well describe physical phenomena in the low energies where the higgs particle can be regarded as elementary particle . on the other hand , if the higgs particle is composed of some elementary particle , the higgs - yukawa sector of the model will be useless in some high - energy region because the lagrangian written in terms of the local higgs field must be useless to describe the inside of the higgs particle . in the scenario of bhl ,",
    "the higgs - yukawa sector becomes useless at a high - energy scale @xmath0 and above owing to the divergence of the yukawa coupling constant for the top quark at the scale .",
    "besides , bhl have also supposed that the higgs field becomes a non - propagating auxiliary field at @xmath0 , and so the higgs - yukawa system is equivalent to a local four - fermi system at the scale .",
    "these two phenomena can be considered to indicate the compositeness of the higgs particle .",
    "using one of the compositeness conditions of bhl , one can predict the top quark mass depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted masses are larger that the experimental value as for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 gev is planck scale ) , and several improvements and extensions of bhl s model have been studied  @xcite .",
    "our attempt to improve the model is very simple : we merely remove the condition that leads to the predictions contradicted by the experiment from the compositeness conditions .",
    "we consider what occurs in this case , and reconsider the condition for the higgs particle to be the composite particle .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that if we use the @xmath3 functions of the mass independent renormalization scheme in bhl s model , we can not properly describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking . this is the same in our scenario for the composite higgs particle ( see appendix a ) .",
    "ideally , we should use wilson s renormalization scheme  @xcite as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , the treatment of the rg equation is not so easy in this scheme .",

    "there , it was concluded that this substitution is valid as an approximation except for the @xmath3 function for the mass parameter . in this paper , we will also define the renormalization transformation in our cutoff model with having the wilson renormalization approach in mind , and give the @xmath3 functions for the quartic ( @xmath6 ) and the quadratic ( @xmath7 ) coupling constants of the higgs self - interactions . to give them , we will use the perturbative expansion with respect to all the coupling constants including the yukawa coupling constant for the top quark , which does not diverge at @xmath0 in our scenario .",
