    "lattice thermal conductivity of substitutionally disordered alloys yield valuable information about the interactions of thermal excitations , phonons , with composition fluctuations on their crystal lattice . over the past few years",
    "numerous experimental studies @xcite-@xcite of the thermal conductivity of disordered alloys have provided considerable insight into the nature of their elementary excitations .",
    "the theory of lattice thermal conductivity for perfect crystals and ordered alloys has been set up on a rigorous basis .",
    "however the same is not true for disordered alloys .",
    "the presence of disorder results in scattering that not only depends on the impurity concentration but also crucially on both the relative masses and size difference between the constituent atoms . for large mass or size differences ,",
    "the effect of disorder can be quite unusual .",
    "because of this , detailed comparison between theory and experiment on the basis of realistic models has not been very extensive .",
    "model calculations are mostly based on mean - field approaches with diagonal disorder alone .",
    "whereas in phonon problems essential off - diagonal disorder in the force constants can not be dealt within single site mean field approximations .",
    "such disorder effects can not be ignored in realistic calculations .",
    "when we come to comparison with experiment , however , we face a different kind of difficulty . in any experiment ,",
    "the measured thermal conductivity @xmath1 consists of the sum of an electronic component @xmath2 and a lattice component @xmath3 and @xmath4 . assuming the thermal analogue of matthiessen s rule to be valid , the electronic thermal resistivity @xmath5 is given by the sum of an ideal resistivity and an impurity or residual term .",
    "it is often assumed that the ideal resistivity remains unaltered by alloying and can be obtained from the measurements on pure metals .",
    "the residual resistivity @xmath6 can be calculated with the help of widemann - franz law @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lorenz number and @xmath9(t ) is determined by measuring the electrical resistivity of the alloy at several temperatures .",
    "the lattice component @xmath3 can then be separated out from the observed conductivity @xmath1 .",
    "overall what we would like to convey from these details is that a direct measurement of the lattice component of the thermal conductivity is not feasible .",
    "there always exists certain assumptions behind the calculation of @xmath2 and hence it is not possible always to obtain reliable estimates for this quantity which consequently affects the separation of @xmath3 from the observed conductivity @xmath1 .    in an earlier communication @xcite(hereafter referred to as am ) we had developed a formalism for the calculation of configuration averaged lattice thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity for a disordered binary alloy . unlike single - site mean - field approaches , this formulation has no restrictions on what kind of substitutional disorder can be studied .",
    "it explicitly takes into account fluctuations in masses , force constants and heat currents between different nuclei .",
    "it also maintains , on the average , the sum rule between the diagonal and off - diagonal parts of the dynamical matrix which eliminates the translational mode .",
    "we had shown that the dominant effect of disorder is to renormalize each propagator as well as the current terms in the kubo formula .",
    "the purpose of this article is to implement the formulation ( am ) for a detailed numerical study of the configuration averaged lattice conductivity and thermal diffusivity for disordered nipt and nipd alloys .",
    "the choice of the alloy systems is not arbitrary .",
    "we have chosen these alloys in order to propose a systematic study of the effects of mass disorder and strong force constant disorder . in the nipd alloys ,",
    "mass disorder is much larger than the force constant disorder .",
    "however both kinds of disorder dominate in the nipt alloys .",
    "moreover in both the two alloy systems there is a large size mismatch between the constituents .",
    "this indicates that the standard single site mean field theories would be inadequate to capture these effects .",
    "these alloy systems are therefore ideal for the illustration of the advantages of the augmented space block recursion method proposed by us @xcite .",
    "theoretically there have been many attempts @xcite-@xcite to develop an adequate approximation for understanding the lattice thermal conductivity of metals and alloys .",
    "the majority were based on model calculations either for perfect crystals or ordered alloys .",
    "one of the most successful mean - field approximation was the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite in combination with the appropriate kubo formula .",
    "the cpa is a single site mean - field theory capable of dealing only with mass disorder .",
    "there have been many attempts to generalize the cpa in order to treat both off - diagonal and environmental disorder .",
    "in many cases these approximations did not satisfy the necessary herglotz analytic and lattice translational invariance properties of the configuration averaged green functions .",
    "two very similar approaches , both based on the augmented space theorem , have been recently proposed : the itinerant cluster cpa ( icpa ) @xcite and the augmented space recursion @xcite .",
    "these have been used to study the lattice dynamics of ni@xmath10pd@xmath11 , ni@xmath12pt@xmath12 and ni@xmath13cr@xmath14 alloys . in a more generalized context of inelastic neutron scattering in disordered alloys ,",
    "an augmented space block recursion ( asbr ) has also been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "the asbr calculates the full green and self - energy matrices instead of their diagonal entries alone .",
    "these are required for obtaining the response functions .    in this paper , we shall make use of the asbr technique to implement the theoretical formulation for the lattice thermal conductivity developed earlier by us .",
    "we shall study the dependence of lattice thermal conductivity on phonon frequency as well as on temperature in a series of disordered nipd and nipt alloys covering the full range of alloy compositions .",
    "as far as the temperature dependence of lattice conductivity is concerned , our results follow a general trend .",
    "we shall also discuss how the lattice conductivity behave as a function of concentration at several fixed temperatures .",
    "the notion of a minimum thermal conductivity will be justified .",
    "it will be shown that low temperature resonant modes considerably decrease the conductivity .",
    "an idea about the location of the mobility edge will be discussed from the phonon - frequency dependence of the mode averaged harmonic diffusivity .",
    "this dependence also gives a rough idea about what fraction of the states across the frequency spectrum are delocalized and therefore can carry current .",
    "the concentration dependence of the harmonic diffusivity will also be displayed .",
    "in the next two subsections , we shall apply the formalism introduced in our earlier paper ( am ) to study nipd and nipt alloys across the alloy composition range . in ( am )",
    "we have discussed the theoretical formalism in great detail .",
    "we shall present only the main pointshere and leave the reader to refer to ( am ) for greater detail .",

    "another reason for this difference in the position of dip in @xmath69 may be due to the fact that feldman _ et.al . _ carried out their calculation at a fixed wavevector @xmath59 , while we have summed over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the origin of this dip can also be explained by looking at the joint density of states ( jdos ) represented by green line in fig .",

    "as discussed by feldman@xmath82 , this dip at @xmath78 disappears as the system size @xmath83 .",

    "this is a smooth dependence which closely resembles the specific heat and saturates like the specific heat at high temperaturs .",
    "following slack @xcite we could call this piece the   _ minimum thermal conductivity _ \" .",
    "a number of authors have discussed that low temperature dependence of @xmath0 shows a mild plateau like region . in this regime the heat is mainly carried by the propagating long wavelength acoustic modes .",
    "the complex inelastic scattering processes then kill off the low frequency contribution at higher temperatures leaving a peak which becomes the plateau .",
    "however there are situations , where the propagating modes become reasonably well damped (  as in our calculation  ) and are no longer able to carry much heat .",
    "in such cases the contribution of delocalized and poorly conducting vibrations takes over , giving a net result in good accord with the kittel s old idea . under these circumstances the plateau like region in the low temperature regime almost disappears .",
    "the damping of propagating modes is also amplified as we make the alloy more and more concentrated .",
    "this can easily be verified by looking at the results of reference @xcite , which shows that as we increase the concentration the plateau like region goes down and gets smoother .",

    "[ fig12 ] , we display the frequency dependence of lattice conductivity for nipt alloys at various compositions , but at a fixed temperature t=100 k. as before each of the curves have a dip at the lowest frequency .",
    "it is important to notice that as we increase the pt - concentration @xmath91 , structure appears in the behaviour of @xmath105 .",
    "this indicates that the structure arises due to the contribution of pt - atom ( with large mass ) in the alloy .",
    ".,width=377,height=226 ]    the concentration dependence of lattice conductivity at a fixed phonon frequency @xmath107 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . the various curves in this figure stand for various values of the temperature t starting from a lower value of 50 k to a higher value of 230 k. it is clear from the figure that the concentration dependence is almost symmetric about x=0.5 .",
    "it has been discussed by flicker and leath @xcite within the framework of coherent potential approximation that this asymmetry is a function of the size of the sample chosen i.e. a large n leads to less asymmetry .",
    "they have verified this statement by performing two calculations one for n=100 and other for n=2000 .",
    "the concentration dependence in the later case is more symmetric as compared to the former ones . in our case ,",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] are the optimal symmetric structure for the concentration dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because our calculations are performed in the reciprocal space representation which involves the entire lattice .",
    "an interesting challenge remaining in this problem is to calculate the effect of adding anharmonicity to the model .",
    "the reason why one should be interested in calculating the anharmonicity effect is because in real systems at high temperature phonon - phonon umklapp scattering becomes the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "this umklapp scattering actually arises due to the presence of anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the effect of this anharmonicity is to flatten the lattice conductivity vs concentration curve .     for ni@xmath71pt@xmath72 alloys .",

    "[ fig14 ] shows the frequency dependence of diffusivity @xmath94 for various alloy compositions .",
    "the thick lines on the frequency axes shows the extent of the frequency spectrum .",
    "these have been obtained from the density of states calculations presented in our first paper on the subject @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] that there are basically two regions of large thermal diffusivity : one near the lower frequency region ( @xmath108 ) and the other around a somewhat higher frequency region ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "but as we go on increasing the pt - concentration , the former region of large diffusivity starts decreasing gradually and becomes almost flat for the maximum pt - concentration of 90@xmath110 .",
    "the latter region of large diffusivity sits on a portion of the frequency spectrum above the transverse acoustic vibrations . here",
    "the modes have large velocities and are probably very effective carriers of heat .",
    "the approximate linear decrease in diffusivity starts at @xmath68 3 thz .",
    "but the location of mobility edge in this case varies with composition in a slightly different way as compared to the case of nipd alloy .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( bottom ) shows the position of the mobility edge @xmath111 as a function of the alloy composition . as the concentration of heavy pt increases , the band width of the frequency spectrum ( which is proportional to the square root of the mass ) shrinks and the position of the mobility edge within the band also shrinks .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( top ) shows the fraction of the frequency band which is extended .",
    "when the disorder is the strongest , i.e. at 50 - 50 composition , this fraction is a minimum .",
    "one thing is very clear from the above discussion that , in an alloy where mass disorder dominates and the forceconstant disorder is weak ( as in the case of nipd alloy ) , the complex disorder scattering processes try to localize more vibrational modes as compared to those in an alloy where both mass as well as the force constant disorder dominates ( as in the case of nipt alloy  ) .",
    "the result can be interpreted in a slightly different way as :   _ the role of force constant disorder in binary alloys is to make the vibrational eigenstates more delocalized _ \"  , i.e. the more dominant the force constant disorder is , the more delocalized the vibrational modes will be .",

    "the diffusivity are asymmetric about x=0.5 .",
    "however this asymmetry reduces as we increase the phonon frequency .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected also in the behaviour of thermal conductivity with alloy composition .",
    "we have performed a detailed numerical study of the theoretical formulation ( am ) developed earlier by us for the lattice thermal conductivity of disordered binary alloys .",
    "we have demonstrated through our numerical results that how this multiple scattering based formalism captures the effect of off - diagonal and environmental disorder present in the problem .",
    "the use of augmented space method to keep track of the configuration of the system and the block recursion method have made the implementation simple yet powerful .",
    "this is reflected in the satisfaction of essential herglotz analytic property of the diagonal green function in our earlier calculation @xcite .",
    "a significant contribution of this article beyond the earlier theoretical approaches is the inclusion of force constant fluctuations properly in the theory .",
    "we have applied the formalism ( am ) to two real disordered alloys ; namely nipd and nipt .",
    "we have shown that the effect of disorder corrections to the current and the vertex correction on the overall shape of lattice thermal conductivity for both the alloys are very small . comparatively the effect is found to be more pronounced in nipt alloy , which is due to the presence of strong disorder both in masses and force constants in this alloy .",
    "the prominence of the force constant disorder in nipt alloy has also been demonstrated in the frequency dependence of lattice conductivity for various compositions of the ni@xmath71pt@xmath72 alloy .",
    "the saturation of lattice conductivity at higher temperatures has been shown for both the alloys .",
    "the concentration dependence of @xmath1 in ni@xmath71pd@xmath72 alloy has been shown to be more asymmetric about x=0.5 than in ni@xmath71pt@xmath72 alloy .",
    "the numerical results on the harmonic diffusivity provide an interesting idea about the localization and delocalization of the vibrational eigenstates .",
    "it says that in disordered binary alloys    the more stronger the force constant disorder is , the more delocalized the vibrational modes will be \"  .",
    "that is why nipt alloy has larger fraction of delocalized states as compared to that in nipd alloy . for both the alloys , however we had no prior information about the species dependence of the force constants but rather choose a set of force constants intuitively as we have done earlier @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of the role of disorder in the transport properties of random alloys could be achieved with prior information about the force constants .",
    "these could be obtained from more microscopic theories , e.g. ,  the first principles calculation on a set of ordered alloys .",
    "our future endeavor would be to rectify this and attempt to obtain the dynamical matrix itself from such microscopic theories .    0.5 cm",
