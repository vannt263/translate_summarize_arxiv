    "in 1985 an experimental set - up to measure the distance traveled by an actin filament interacting with a myosin  filament during a complete atp cycle was described  @xcite . under",
    "low load conditions on the actin filament , traveled distances of up to @xmath0  nm were observed .",
    "this value was not understandable according to the most popular idea of the sliding mechanism , rotation or tilting of the myosin head bound on actin molecule , conceived as directly coupled with the atp hydrolysis ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "indipendent , successive experiments ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite and references therein ) then showed distances ranging between 4 and 10 nanometers .",
    "such smaller range of traveled distances is coherent with the lever - arm theory ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) that is still widely believed to account for the generation of the force responsible for the actin filament sliding . the level - arm theory can be essentially schematized as follows ( more details can be found in  @xcite , where a graphical animation is also present ) :    * the binding of an atp molecule on the catalytic site of myosin head produces the detachment of the head from the actin filament . * the atp hydrolysis , that follows within about the next @xmath1  ms , changes atp to adp.pi , determining a free energy variation in one reaction cycle of about @xmath2  @xmath3(see  @xcite ) .",
    "atp hydrolysis also generates a sensible rotation of the neck of the myosin head . *",
    "the transition m.atp@xmath4 m.adp.pi is accompanied by an increase of affinity of this complex for actin ( see  @xcite ) , which enhances the chance of myosin to get binded on an actin site .",
    "since such binding is reversible , the myosin head can visit more than a single actin site . *",
    "while myosin head is binded at an actin site , its neck may suddenly switch back to its original position ( this is the so called power stroke ) with the successive release of the phosphoric radical pi and the occurrence of conformational changes around the myosin coiled coil .",
    "this process is reversible i.e. phosphoric radical pi can re - establish the complex m.adp.pi . in the absence of such recombination , the above - mentioned conformational changes are very likely to generate the sliding of the actin filament with the release of adp molecule after about @xmath5  ms . *",
    "the myosin head stays then binded on the actin site till the arrival of a new atp molecule , which starts the whole process afresh .",
    "summing up , as far as reference is made exclusively to the mechanical phenomenon of the generation of the force responsible for the movement , the lever - arm theory is strictly deterministic : each atp cycle generates one single power - stroke that causes a sliding of constant length and preassigned direction of the actin filament .",
    "within such framework , a tight coupling between atp cycles and protein movements is envisaged .    even though the apparent disagreement of the above mentioned difference of travelled distances could be understood on the base of a low duty - ratio characterizing myosin  heads ( see  @xcite , pages 221226 ) , successive experiments by kitamura _ _ e__t al .",
    "( @xcite ) raised anew the question of such a disagreement .",
    "indeed , aiming at a continuous efforts towards increasingly accurate measurements of the traveled distances during an atp cycle , it was possible to achieve great improvements of the technological set - up that included design and construction of home made  highly sophisticated devices . by exploiting such a technology ,",
    "it was proceeded as follows : a single myosin head was attached to the tip of a glass microneedle and placed near an actin filament that had been previously immobilized on a microscopy slide by means of optical tweezers .",
    "the deflections of the needle with respect to its resting position were then measured and recorded . from the obtained",
    "traces the following three features emerged that are in evident disagreement with the tight coupling theory :    1 .",
    "the total traveled distance ( i.e. the total displacement ) of the myosin head is not constant and it can be as large as @xmath6  nm.[oss1 ] 2 .",
    "this displacement is the sum of a random number of single steps , the amplitude of each of which equals the distance ( @xmath7  nm ) between two successive actin monomers . during the time elapsing between two successive steps , the myosin head randomly jitters around an equilibrium position.[oss2 ] 3 .",
    "steps mainly occurs in a fixed forward  direction , although some of them occasionally take place in the opposite backward  direction .",
    "hereafter , forward steps will be taken as positive and backward steps as negative .",
    "the total displacement is thus the algebraic sum of the number of performed forward and backward steps.[oss3 ]    such evidence contrasts the one - to - one relation hypothesized between atp hydrolysis and the occurrence of the mechanical event consisting of the power stroke in the myosin head .",
    "furthermore the observation of the existence of random elements leads one to conjecture that a significant role could be played in such context by the thermal agitation of the environmental molecules of the watery solution in which the involved proteins are embedded .",
    "this is the motivation for the assumption of the existence of a loose coupling between atp cycle and actomyosin dynamics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    while referring to  @xcite for a lucid outline of the origin of the controversy existing among the supporters of the loose coupling approach and the community of those faithful to the lever - arm theory , and therefore also to the tight coupling vision , in the present paper we purpose to extend the phenomenological model earlier proposed by some of us ( @xcite ) by including in it the effect of the swing of the lever - arm .",
    "thus doing we show that the experimental data of myosin sliding obtained in  @xcite under various load conditions can be very well accounted for .",
    "specifically , via the comparison of our theoretical results with those yielded by our experiments , we shall test the assumption that during the time interval elapsing between the attachment of myosin head to the actin filament and the final release of the phosphoric radical ( rising phase in the sequel ) , the position of the myosin head is determined , both by the lever - arm swing and by the action of brownian motion , that includes a macroscopic deterministic force responsible for a non - zero average net displacement .",
    "such a direction - orienting force can be viewed as the originated by changes of chemical states that accur within the myosin head and that are fuelled by energy supplied by myosin head itself .",
    "such a view is coherent with the notion of effective driving potential  in the sense , for instance , of wang and oster  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the coupling between the atp cycle and the mechanical effects should appear to be less rigid , and the actomyosin dynamics should definitely exhibit variability features of the kind mentioned in the above  [ oss1].@xmath8[oss3 ] .",
    "items .    the above outlined conjectured random dynamics will be described in details in section 2 with a specific reference to an earlier paper  @xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to showing that , within such a framework , it is possible to handle a key point of the mentioned controversy .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite the essential relevance of the role played by the length of the myosin neck is stressed , since the lever - arm theory makes the sliding distance less than , and somewhat proportional to , such length .",
    "this would for instance imply that reducing the length of the myosin neck to a half should reduce to a half the sliding distance , which appears to be confirmed by the experiments in  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", certain performed experiments only show slight changes of the overall displacement of the myosin head even after complete removal of its neck  @xcite .    in order to reconcile these evident discrepancies",
    ", we shall assume that the displacement @xmath9 of the myosin head during the atp cycle could in general be envisaged as a linear combination as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the displacement induced by the biased thermal effects and @xmath12 the displacement generated by the power stroke , and where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants , each of which hereafter will be taken as equal to 0 or 1 .",
    "note that the case @xmath15 and @xmath16 yields the lever - arm theory ; instead , setting @xmath17 and @xmath18 depicts a purely random situation , in the absence of any sliding due to the power stroke .",
    "finally , the case @xmath19 leads to an integration of the two theories . with the choice @xmath19",
    ", the controversial results related to the length of the neck of myosin head can be overcome by assuming that the random displacement is a few times larger than the deterministic one .",
    "this assumption implies that only slight changes of the total distance traveled by myosin head would be observable when the contribution @xmath12 due the power stroke is made somewhat smaller by shortening the length of the myosin neck .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the distance between each pair of neighboring actin monomers . as suggested in recent literature ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) in our computations we shall take @xmath21  nm .",
    "in addition , we shall assumed that the magnitude of the sliding induced by the swing of the lever - arm equals that of a step , and thus take @xmath22 .",
    "our conjectured relation  ( [ spostamento ] ) with @xmath19 is preliminarily supported by the bar chart in fig .",
    "4c ) of  @xcite showing that at least one step is performed by each and every myosin head during the rising phase .",
    "the second column of table  [ distribuzionenumeronettosalti ] shows the heights of the columns of the mentioned bar chart , whereas the first column indicates net step numbers , i.e. the integral part of the ratios @xmath23 .",
    "the quoted experiment was performed under low load conditions by means of microneedles having stiffness less than @xmath24  pn@xmath25 nm .    [ cols=\"^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     14",
    "cm the first two columns list the net number of steps performed by myosin heads and the corresponding observed frequencies .",
    "the remaining four columns show the net step distributions , obtained via numerical simulations using the indicated potential profiles all possessing @xmath26  @xmath3 . in all cases @xmath27  pn , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30  ns .",
    "other parameter have been chosen as in figure  [ muversusfe ] .",
    "variation coefficients and mean - exit times @xmath31 , obtained via eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , are listed as well .",
    "pot.cinquebis    next task is to pinpoint the effects of the potential profiles on the mean first - exit time . to this purpose , we refer to table  [ dwelltime ] showing that the mean dwell time in lowest load condition is @xmath32  ms . after choosing @xmath27  pn , we then make use of eq.([mu ] ) for each and every one of the four considered potentials imposing that the left hand side equals such value of @xmath31 . by iterated numerical integrations , for each potential profile the corresponding value of @xmath33 is finally determined .",
    "the result are listed in table  [ altezze ] , where the effect of the parameter @xmath34 in lindner - type profile has been detailed .",
    "the behavior of mean first - exit time @xmath31 as a function of the magnitude of the external force is shown in figure  [ muversusfe+profili ] .",
    "all considered cases of table  [ altezze ] lead to graphs falling in the region bounded by the lowest and the highest curves .",
    "we point out that changing the potential profiles never yields mean first - exit time changes exceeding @xmath35 .",
    "hence , we are led to conclude that the depth @xmath33 of the potential well can be tuned to acceptable biological values by a suitable selection of the potential profile , without affecting appreciably the value of the mean first - exit time . for instance",
    ", switching from saw - toot to lindner - type potential with @xmath36 , lowers @xmath33 by more than @xmath5  @xmath3 .",
    "( see table  [ altezze ] ) .",
    "it is thus conceivable that a variety of potential profiles exists such that the height of the potential well can be further lowered , in a way to switch from about @xmath37  @xmath3 as indicated in  @xcite to about @xmath38  @xmath3 as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "figure / fig5.eps 13 cm for each potential profile the mean first - exit time @xmath31 is plotted as a function of the external force @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath33 , for each potential , are listed in table  [ altezze ] .",
    "we have taken @xmath27  pn , while the other parameters have been chosen as in figure  [ muversusfe ] .",
    "muversusfe+profili    the quantitative analysis and comparison with available data has been performed under the assumption of rigorous symmetries exhibited by the profiles of the potentials generating the periodic force acting on the brownian particles .",
    "it is , however , presumable that the complex biological reality underlying the observed motion of the myosin heads may require to relax the rigorous symmetry assumption . to test the effect of symmetry breaking , we take into consideration the saw - toot potential @xmath40 of table  [ potenziali ] and make it asymmetric by taking @xmath41 , namely by shifting in either direction the point of minimum of the potential . thus doing , the introduced asymmetry should affect the motion of the brownian particles . while the probabilities of exit from the current potential well are insensitive to the potential s profile , and hence also to its asymmetry , the mean first - exit time @xmath31 is clearly affected by it , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .",
    "the quantitative dependence of @xmath31 on the potential s asymmetry is indicated in figure  [ muversusfe+asimmetria ] , where on the abscissa the external force @xmath39 is indicated .",
    "each curve is characterized by two parameters : the point @xmath42 of minimum and the depth @xmath33 of the potential .",
    "figure / fig6.eps 13 cm for the saw - toot potential profile with the indicated value of asymmetry @xmath42 , the mean first - exit time @xmath31 is plotted as a function of the external force @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath33 such that one obtains @xmath32  ms for @xmath43  pn , are also indicated on each curve .",
    "we have taken @xmath27  pn , while the other parameters have been chosen as in figure  [ muversusfe ] .",
    "muversusfe+asimmetria    from top to bottom , the first curve is characterized by asymmetry @xmath44  nm , implying a somewhat steeper rise of the potential in the backward direction .",
    "such asymmetry is mitigated in the next curve ( @xmath45  nm ) .",
    "the third curve , indicated in bold , is used as a comparison tool , as it refer to symmetric profile ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the remaining two curves are labeled by @xmath47  nm and @xmath48  nm , thus representing mirror - image situation with respect to the zero - asymmetry case .",
    "now the forward edges of the potentials are steeper . for each curve ,",
    "the indicated value of @xmath33 has been determined by imposing that @xmath32  ms when @xmath43  pn ( lowest load ) , so that all curves originate at the same point .",
    "as figure  [ muversusfe+asimmetria ] shows , changes of the potential s asymmetry of 30@xmath49 in either direction do not affect greatly the magnitude of the mean first - exit time .",
    "finally , we remark that suitable choices of backward asymmetry ( such @xmath44  nm in figure  [ muversusfe+asimmetria ] ) improve the fitting of the experimental data even for larger load values .",
    "the model of actomyosin dynamics discussed in the foregoing rests on the assumption that the total energy made available to the myosin head by the atp molecule hydrolysis and by the thermal bath has a two - fold overall role : to produce the power stroke predicted by the lever - arm model and also to generate the kind of sliding of myosin head on the actin filament in the loose coupling  mechanism originally hypothesized in  @xcite and then experimentally demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "this is expressed mathematically via the representation of the displacement of a particle consisting of a combination of a deterministic part and of a random component .",
    "the latter is generated by the simultaneous presence of a washboard - type potential and a random force arising from thermal fluctuations .",
    "our model has then been tested by making use of a set of data on the dwell times and step frequencies of myosin heads under various load conditions .",
    "we have shown that by a suitable tuning of the internal force and depth of the potential well , the theoretically calculated probability @xmath50 and mean first - exit time @xmath31 of the representative brownian particle are in good agreement with their biological counterpart .",
    "a second set of experimental data concerning the net step number distribution of myosin heads under low load conditions has then been exploited to show that the washboard potential used by us is able to reproduce such distribution within the mathematical analogy . to the rather small size of the experimental sample",
    "should be ascribed the 3@xmath49 discrepancy represented by the two net backward displacements predicted by our model .",
    "next , the robustness of our model has been tested by inserting 4 different potential profiles in the langevin equation of motion .",
    "the consequently performed calculations have shown that the mean exit - time depends on the external force in a way that is essentially insensitive to the chosen potential s profile .",
    "the chosen profile , instead , has been seen to play an essential role in that it critically relates the depth of the potential well to magnitude of the mean exit - time .",
    "a finer tuning of the mean exit - time is finally achieved by regulating the level of asymmetry of the potential s profile .",
