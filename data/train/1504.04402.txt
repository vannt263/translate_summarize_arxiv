    "ensemble modeling has been employed in weather forecasting in order to quantify prediction uncertainties and determine forecast confidence @xcite .",
    "individual forecasts which constitute an ensemble forecast represent possible scenarios which approximate a probability distribution that reflects forecasting uncertainties .",
    "such uncertainties which when considered as a group include those associated with initial conditions ( such as observational uncertainties ) , techniques and models . different forecasts in the ensemble can start from different initial conditions and/or be based on different forecasting models / procedures . in the simplest application , the ensemble mean or a weighted mean can be taken as a single forecast .",
    "the ensemble mean should perform better than individual ensemble members by emphasizing systematic features found in all members .",
    "however , an ensemble also contains additional information about possible scenarios and their probabilities and thus provides a probabilistic forecast .",
    "for example , ensemble modeling provides a quantitative description of the forecast probability that an event will occur by giving event occurrence predictions as a percentage of ensemble size .",
    "this conveys the level of uncertainty in a given forecast in contrast to a categorical yes / no forecast .",
    "additionally , all ensemble forecast members can be plotted together to allow visualization of the uncertainty among ensemble members , and their clustering distribution .",
    "an example of such a visualization is hurricane track `` plume '' maps in weather forecasting .",
    "regions where members tend to coincide / cluster can be taken to have a higher forecast confidence .",
    "to understand the uncertainties in space weather forecasting , ensemble coronal mass ejection ( cme ) forecasting efforts have now begun in space weather models of the heliosphere .",
    ", , and compared the performance of real - time shock arrival time forecasts following solar events ( since 1997 ) from the three `` fearless forecast '' models : shock time of arrival ( stoa)@xcite , interplanetary shock propagation model ( ispm)@xcite , and hakamada - akasofu - fry ( hafv.2)@xcite . while there are many models predicting the evolution of cmes ( see @xcite and references therein ) , only the wang - sheeley - arge ( wsa ) coronal model @xcite coupled with the global heliospheric enlil solar wind model @xcite has been used extensively in space weather operations world - wide . the first effort in utilizing this model for ensemble forecasting of cme propagation was reported by . performed wsa - enlil ensemble cme modeling using 100 ensemble members for 15 historical events with automatically determined cone model cme parameters @xcite .",
    "they found that the observed cme arrival was within the ensemble prediction spread for 8 out of the 15 events .",
    "discuss ensemble modeling of cme propagation with wsa - enlil for an event study using eight ensemble members and various synoptic background maps .",
    "differences found in the predicted arrival time of each individual simulation were mostly due to cme initial speed and the time at which the cme was inserted at the wsa - enlil inner boundary , resulting in propagation through a different background solar wind .",
    "they used national solar observatory global oscillation network group ( gong ) @xcite synoptic magnetograms and air force data assimilative photospheric flux transport ( adapt ) maps @xcite . for their cme event",
    "they show that when using adapt maps , the wsa - enlil model values were in better agreement with in - situ observations , and the arrival time predictions were improved due to the more accurate background solar wind representation .",
    "however , the overall spread in cme arrival times did not change significantly .",
    "this paper describes the wsa - enlil+cone ensemble modeling system installed at the _ community coordinated modeling center _ ( ccmc ) and results from the past 1.5 years of real - time execution at the ccmc/_space weather research center_. this is the first ensemble space weather prediction system for cme propagation of its kind employed in a real - time environment .",
    "the current version of the system evaluates the sensitivity of cme arrival time predictions from the wsa - enlil+cone model to initial cme parameters .",
    "the ccmc , located at nasa goddard space flight center , is an interagency partnership to facilitate community research and accelerate implementation of progress in research into space weather operations .",
    "the swrc is a ccmc sub - team which provides space weather services to nasa robotic mission operators and science campaigns , and prototypes new models , forecasting techniques and procedures .",
    "the ccmc also serves the _ cme scoreboard _",
    "website to the research community who may submit cme arrival time predictions in real - time for a variety of forecasting methods .",
    "the website facilitates model validation under real - time conditions and enables collaboration . for every cme event table on the site ,",
    "the average of all submitted forecasts is automatically computed , thus itself providing a world - wide ensemble mean cme arrival time forecast from a variety of models / methods .    in section [ model ] a brief description of the wsa - enlil+cone model is given . the triangulation algorithm for determining cme parameters for the enlil model",
    "is described in section [ params ] .",
    "the real - time ensemble modeling methodology is explained in section [ method ] followed by an example of an ensemble simulation given in section [ event ] .",
    "results and the evaluation of the first 1.5 years of simulations are described in section [ results ] . in section [ case ]",
    "we discuss a parametric event case study of the sensitivity of the cme arrival time prediction to model free parameters for the cme and ambient solar wind .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion are presented in section [ disc ] .",
    "the global 3d mhd wsa - enlil model provides a time - dependent description of the background solar wind plasma and magnetic field into which a cme can be inserted @xcite .",
    "this modeling system does not simulate cme initiation but uses kinematic properties of cmes inferred from coronagraphs to launch a cme - like hydrodynamic structure into the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field computed from the wsa coronal model @xcite . a common method to estimate the",
    "3d cme kinematic and geometric parameters is to assume that the geometrical cme properties are approximated by the cone model @xcite which assumes isotropic expansion , radial propagation , and constant cme cone angular width .",
    "generally , a cme disturbance is inserted in the wsa - enlil model as slices of a homogeneous spherical plasma cloud with uniform velocity , density , and temperature as a time - dependent inner boundary condition at 21.5 solar radii ( @xmath1 ) with an unchanged background magnetic field .",
    "while the simplest geometrical case is employed in this work , the wsa - enlil+cone model can also support an elliptical geometry including tilt , an elongated spheroid or ellipsoid , and leading and trailing edge velocities .",
    "measurements derived from coronagraphs ( described in section [ stereocat ] ) determine the cloud velocity , location , and width .",
    "the cme cloud density ( dcld ) is a free parameter which by default is 4 times larger than typical mean values in the ambient fast wind providing a pressure of four times larger than that in the ambient fast wind .",
    "the cloud temperature is taken to be equal to the ambient fast wind temperature .",
    "another enlil free cme parameter is the cavity ratio which allows the cme to be represented by a spherical shell of plasma and is based on coronagraph observations of cme cavities . the cavity ratio radcav is defined as the ratio of the radial cme cavity width to the cme width , with the default being no cavity ( radcav=0 ) .",
    "wsa - enlil+cone runs performed for research and operations have shown that accurate descriptions of the heliosphere and transients are achieved only when the background solar wind is well - reproduced and if coronagraph observations from multiple views , for example from the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) spacecraft near the earth @xcite and the solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) spacecraft @xcite , are used to derive cme parameters @xcite .",
    "wsa coronal maps provide the magnetic field and solar wind speed at the boundary between the coronal and heliospheric models , usually at 21.5 @xmath1 , and they are generated from synoptic magnetograms .",
    "small latitudinal shifts in the magnetogram - derived coronal maps caused by inaccuracies in solar magnetic field observations , particularly in the polar regions , can cause large longitudinal shifts in the solar wind structure , for example in characterizing high speed stream arrival times ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "other coronal models , such as mas ( mhd around a sphere ) @xcite or heliospheric tomography from interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) @xcite can also provide the background solar wind and have been coupled with enlil heliospheric simulations .",
    "ccmc / swrc has been carrying out routine wsa - enlil+cone simulations for several years using solar magnetic synoptic maps and cme geometric and kinematic properties inferred from coronagraph observations @xcite .",
    "each enlil run uses a wsa model synoptic map computed from the single gong daily - updated synoptic magnetogram ( see e.g. ) closest to the time the simulation is executed .",
    "these low 4@xmath2 resolution real - time simulations complete in @xmath320 minutes running on 2 nodes with 16 processors / node on a spherical grid size of 256@xmath430@xmath490 ( @xmath5 ) with 5 - 10 minute output cadence at locations of interest .",
    "the simulation range is 0.1 to 2 au in radius @xmath6 , -60@xmath2 to + 60@xmath2 in latitude @xmath7 , and 0@xmath2 to 360@xmath2 in longitude @xmath8 .",
    "cme parameters are derived using real - time coronagraph observations from spacecraft and a geometric triangulation algorithm .",
    "the measurements are an approximation of the true 3d speed and width of the cme at 21.5@xmath1 ( enlil inner boundary )",
    ". however , often the coronagraph derived measurements are inferred from just a few data points , and some cmes may be missed due to real - time data gaps .",
    "cme parameters derived in real - time and simulation graphical outputs are publicly available from the ccmc",
    "_ space weather database of notifications , knowledge , information _ _ ( donki ) _ database .",
    "cme parameters are determined using the stereoscopic cme analysis tool ( stereocat ) , developed by the ccmc for real - time cme analysis carried out by the ccmc / swrc forecasting team .",
    "the goal was to develop a tool that can be used quickly , yet reliably in a real - time environment with any possible combination of spacecraft available for analysis .",
    "it was also required that the tool was intuitive and simple enough to be employed by a wide variety of users such as space weather forecasters , scientists , students , and citizen scientists .",
    "the basic methodology of the tool , i.e. , tracking of cme kinematic properties from two different fields - of - view , is similar to that of the _ noaa space weather prediction center _ cme analysis tool ( cat ) by and the geometric localization developed by .",
    "however , stereocat does not attempt to capture the volumetric structure of cmes but is based on tracking specific cme features .",
    "the algorithm is most similar to the cme geometric triangulation method of . for a more detailed discussion of different cme analysis techniques in the context of cone model - based cme simulations ,",
    "see @xcite . other stereoscopic methods for determining",
    "the kinematic properties of cmes include those by , , and .",
    "stereocat is based on triangulation of transient cme features from two different coronagraph fields - of - view or planes - of - sky .",
    "we will call these planes - of - sky @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which may designate , for example , fields - of - view of the secchi / cor2 instruments onboard the stereo a and stereo b spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the tool is used to manually identify the same cme features in two consecutive images which are then used to calculate the plane - of - sky velocities for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "note that these velocities are in local plane - of - sky coordinates indicated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these data need to be brought into the same coordinate system ( heliospheric earth equatorial ( heeq ) coordinates in this case ) , which can be accomplished by rotations :    @xmath15    where operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 carry out transformations from planes - of - sky @xmath9 and @xmath10 coordinates into a common base such as heeq , respectively .",
    "we then define two projection matrices as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a 3 @xmath4 3 identity matrix .",
    "the unit vectors normal to the planes - of - sky of coronagraphs @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the transpose of matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 project any vector to plane - of - skies @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . consequently , plane - of - sky speeds can be expressed as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the three dimensional vector pointing toward the propagation direction of the cme .",
    "while individual projection matrices are not invertible , we can combine eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vapa ] ) and ( [ eq : vbpb ] ) to obtain    @xmath27    from which we can solve    @xmath28    importantly , @xmath29 exists as long as planes - of - sky @xmath9 and @xmath10 are different , i.e. when @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not co - linear ( parallel to each other ) .",
    "therefore large triangulation errors occur when the spacecraft separation angle is very small or around 180@xmath2 .",
    "a similar approach can be used to track the three - dimensional location @xmath32 of a feature from plane - of - sky measurements @xmath33 and @xmath34 as    @xmath35    often the time stamps of coronagraph imagery from spacecraft @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not match exactly .",
    "this is handled in stereocat by propagating the tracked feature in @xmath9 with speed @xmath36 to a new @xmath33 that matches the @xmath10 time stamp .",
    "consequently , matching time stamps are used for @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : invr ] ) .",
    "the angular size of a cme is estimated in stereocat simply by manually selecting the two outer edges of the cme .",
    "these two lines that connect through the center of the sun are then used to compute the opening angle of the cme .",
    "it is noted that this process does not take into account projection of the outer cme edges to the spacecraft plane - of - sky , and is therefore a measurement of the projected cme width .",
    "while this is not an issue if the cme propagation direction is not too far away from the plane - of - sky of the spacecraft which is used to measure the opening angle , one needs to be very careful with events with propagation directions substantially away from the plane - of - sky , as in such cases the opening angle can be overestimated .",
    "this issue will be addressed in the future versions of stereocat",
    ".    other limitations of stereocat arise from the user s ability to reliably identify the same structures in images from both spacecraft due to ambiguities from the different viewing angles .",
    "it may at times be difficult or impossible to track the same structure since different sections of the cme contribute most strongly to images in different planes - of - sky @xcite . consequently , stereocat is not suitable to use with coronagraph data in which the cme appears as a halo , since the cme leading edge is not visible .",

    "the plane - of - sky leading edge measurements ( central white circles ) are later combined together using the triangulation algorithm discussed in sections [ stereocat]-[stereocatmodes ] to generate @xmath37 ensemble members .",
    "the distribution of the resulting cme parameters which are used as initial conditions for 36 wsa - enlil+cone simulations is shown in figure [ fig : catmeashist1].,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      stereocat has three modes : `` two - timepoint '' , `` ensemble '' , and `` frame series '' , and is available online via a web interface @xcite .",
    "available coronagraphs include the lasco c2 and c3 instruments on board the soho spacecraft @xcite , and the secchi / cor2 instruments on the stereo a and b spacecraft .",
    "all three modes are based on the same triangulation algorithm , described in section [ stereocat ] . in the basic `` two - timepoint '' mode the user manually measures the cme leading edge height for two different times in each coronagraph image for two different coronagraph viewpoints .",
    "the plane - of - sky sky speed for each viewpoint is calculated , from which the triangulated speed and direction is computed using the algorithm described in section [ stereocat ] .",
    "the user also manually measures the cme opening angle in each coronagraph view . because this is a projected width measurement , both widths and their average",
    "are displayed for the user .    in `` ensemble '' mode",
    "the user manually repeats the same procedure as for the `` two - timepoint '' mode , by measuring the same feature for the same pair of coronagraphs at two different times . between each `` two - timepoint '' measurement ,",
    "the display is fully reset such that the user is forced to carefully remeasure the cme leading edge height and opening angle .",

    "the user may inspect histograms of their cme parameters .",
    "the web interface allows the user to remove any ensemble members , and add any `` custom '' members .",
    "generally , members are removed when they have nearly identical parameters , or members for which the triangulation appears unreliable .",
    "custom members can be measurements from different image time pairs , from plane of sky estimates which incorporate the source location , or from any other cme measurement technique .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to create @xmath42 individual ensemble measurements for @xmath43 cmes for a series of events which are then combined one - to - one to be simulated together such that there are @xmath42 ensemble members containing @xmath43 cmes each .",
    "in `` frame series '' mode the user can measure a series of different frames ( times ) for each spacecraft , which are then triangulated to create a cme height - time profile .",

    "triangulations made with different spacecraft pairs are shown as separate height - time profiles .",
    "several methods are used to calculate the cme speed , acceleration , the time the cme passes 21.5 @xmath44 ( enlil inner boundary ) , and the time it erupts from the sun .",
    "these include least - squares linear and quadratic fits , averages over selected data points , and averages from only the first and last data points .",
    "results for each method are reported separately , allowing the user to choose the most appropriate fitting technique depending on the acceleration profile of the cme .",
    "plane - of - sky values are also reported , which can be used when coronagraph projection effects make this triangulation method unreliable .",
    "this can occur if the cme is very wide , appears as a halo , or is heavily projected in the coronagraph data . in these cases",
    "the user will not be able to identify the same cme leading edge feature in the data from two coronagraphs .",

    "which ensemble simulations were performed .",
    "the arrival time is generally based on the arrival of the cme - generated shock at the earth .",
    "the ensemble mean absolute error and rmse are both comparable with other cme arrival time prediction errors reported in the literature .    when considering the overall performance of cme arrival prediction , it was found that the correct rejection rate is 62% , the false - alarm rate is 38% , correct alarm ratio is 77% , and false alarm ratio is 23% .",
    "each ensemble cme arrival time forecast includes a forecast probability @xmath66 , which conveys a forecast uncertainty about the likelihood that the cme will arrive , which can be compared with observations to determine forecast reliability .",
    "the brier score ( @xmath109 ) of 0.15 for all 30 ensemble cme arrival probabilities indicates that in this sample , on average , the predicted probability of the cme arriving is fairly accurate .",
    "( a @xmath109 of 0 on a range of 0 to 1 is a perfect forecast . )",
    "however , the reliability diagram ( figure [ fig : rank]a ) shows that the ensemble simulations are underforecasting the likelihood that the cme will arrive in the forecast bins between 20 - 80% , and slightly overforecasting in the 1 - 20% and 80 - 100% forecast bins .",
    "overforecasting is when the forecast chance of cme arrival is higher than is actually observed ; i.e. , the cme is observed to arrive less often than is predicted .",
    "more ensemble simulations are needed for a more robust forecast verification of these probabilistic cme arrival time forecasts .",
    "for 8 out of 17 of the ensemble runs containing hits , the observed cme arrival was within the spread of ensemble arrival time predictions .",
    "the initial distribution of cme input parameters was shown to be an important influence on the accuracy of cme arrival time predictions .",
    "particularly , the median and spread of the input distribution should accurately represent the range of cme parameters derived from observations .",
    "this is evidenced by the rank histogram ( figure [ fig : rank]b ) which illustrates that roughly half of the observed arrivals are outside the spread of predictions , and also suggests undervariability in initial conditions ; i.e. , these ensembles do not sample a wide enough spread in cme input parameters .",
    "each set of ensemble simulations also provides a probabilistic @xmath0 forecast @xmath111 for each @xmath0 bin @xmath112 which can be compared with observations to determine forecast reliability .",
    "the brier score ( @xmath109 ) for the probabilistic @xmath0 forecast bins show reliability for the @xmath0=5 and 6 bins ( @xmath109=0.17 for both ) , and less so for the @xmath0=3 and 4 bins ( @xmath109=0.27 and 0.19 ) .",

    "there is a known overall tendency for the overprediction of @xmath0 , generally found for cme input speeds above 800 - 1000 km / s .",
    "again , more ensemble simulations are needed to provide better forecast verification and to calibrate the @xmath0 forecast .",
    "this paper focuses on the forecast verification of the ensemble modeling aspect of cme arrival and @xmath0 predictions .",
    "more events , as well as comparison of results using different cme propagation models , are needed for more comprehensive forecast verification .",
    "these aspects are being investigated in a separate verification study which evaluates @xmath108400 single wsa - enlil+cone simulations ( of which there are @xmath10870 simulations containing cme arrivals ) performed at the ccmc / swrc .",
    "the parameter sensitivity studied discussed in section [ case ] suggests future directions for this ensemble system . in the addition to the using the default model values , new ensemble runs could be performed with changes to the cme cavity ratio and density ratio as informed by coronagraph measurements of the cme . as discussed in section [ model ]",
    "an accurate representation of the background solar wind is necessary for simulating transients , and prediction errors arising from background characterization and other model limitations should be considered .",
    "an ensemble forecast reflecting uncertainties in the background solar wind could be produced by using a variety of magnetograms ( from different observatories or processed using different techniques ) as input to the wsa or wsa - adapt models . from these results",
    "one can produce an ensemble of ambient solar wind wsa - enlil model outputs which can be compared to in - situ measurements to determine `` best '' coronal maps / model instance .",
    "these sub - selected wsa or wsa - adapt maps could then be used for a series of ensemble wsa - enlil+cone cme simulations .",
    "such an improved ensemble forecast would produce predictions which also reflect uncertainties in the wsa - enlil modeled background solar wind in addition to the uncertainties in cme input parameters ( as considered in this work ) .",
    "another improvement could be the use of real - time interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) observations by the ooty radio telescope @xcite .",
    "these data can provide crucial information about the cme propagation and interaction with the surrounding solar wind which could be used to provide updated information on cme parameters as the cme moves out from the sun .",
    "this information could then be used to refine model predictions of the propagation of the cme .",
    "the stereo heliospheric imagers also provide cme propagation information out to 1au . however , it is not always possible to extract this information from real - time data , and the imagers do not always have an optimal viewing angle for earth - directed cmes .",
    "comparisons of cme propagation from wsa - enlil with near real - time observations of the cme location inferred from ips , the stereo heliospheric imagers , or some other source , can be used to select ensemble members with the best agreement using quantitative and visual inspection employing advanced visualization techniques such as `` 3d volumetric rendering '' @xcite .",
    "finally , the forecasting of cme arrival would benefit from the use of other propagation models , in addition to wsa - enlil , each with its own set of independently assessed input parameters , leading to a community - wide ensemble prediction capability .",
