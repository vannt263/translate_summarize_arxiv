    "it has been well known since the 1970s that a moving mirror can radiate particles @xcite .",
    "a perfect moving mirror acts as a moving boundary and thus changes the states , especially the vacuum , of the quantum fields . for",
    "an appropriately chosen accelerated trajectory the radiation flux is thermal , and an analogy @xcite can be drawn with hawking radiation from a collapsing star @xcite that eventually forms a black hole .",
    "since the thermal fluxes are correlated with the final vacuum fluctuations , some authors @xcite have proposed that the emission of the large amounts of information left in the black hole need not be accompanied by the eventual emission of a large amount of energy , providing a new perspective to the solution of the black hole information paradox @xcite .",
    "the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated mirror is of particular interest . when the mirror is uniformly accelerating , its trajectory is a hyperbola in spacetime , and both the energy flux and particle flux are zero @xcite .",
    "particles and energy are only radiated when the acceleration of the mirror changes . in the case that the mirror eternally accelerates ,",
    "the energy flux along the horizon is divergent @xcite .",
    "this divergence is evidently related to the ideal assumption that the mirror accelerates for infinitely long time .",
    "one way to get rid of the divergence is to turn on and off the mirror so that effectively it interacts with the fields for a finite time @xcite .    in this paper , we develop a quantum circuit model to describe unitary interactions between quantum fields and a uniformly accelerated object ( such as a mirror , cavity , squeezer _ etc . _ ) .",
    "our circuit model can be considered a further development of the matrix formalism first proposed by obadia and parentani @xcite to describe a mirror following general trajectories .",
    "we concentrate on a uniformly accelerated object because the transformations between minkowski modes , rindler modes and unruh modes are well known @xcite and can be represented by some simple quantum optical elements , like two - mode squeezers , beamsplitters _ etc .",
    "_ as an application of our circuit model , we revisit the uniformly accelerated mirror problem in @xmath3-dimensional minkowski spacetime . unlike the self - interaction model proposed by obadia and parentani @xcite , which requires a perturbative expansion and is valid only for low reflection coefficients ,",
    "our circuit model is non - pertubative insofar as it is valid for any value of the reflection coefficient .    for the eternally accelerated mirror ,",
    "the radiation flux in a localized wave packet mode is divergent .",
    "we can regularize this infrared divergence by introducing a low - frequency cutoff for the mirror , which means the mirror is transparent for the low - frequency field modes ( to some extent , this is physically equivalent to having the mirror interact with the field for a finite period of time ) .",
    "after infrared regularization the particle number in a localized wave packet mode is finite .",
    "we further study the properties of the radiation flux and find that the radiation field is squeezed .",
    "this squeezing effect has gone unnoticed up to now , but in our circuit model it is a very straightforward result . we show that the generation of squeezing is closely related to cutting the correlations across the horizon .",

    "recently three assertions about black hole evaporation were shown to be mutually inconsistent@xcite : ( i ) hawking radiation is a unitary process , ( ii ) low energy effective field theory is valid near the event horizon , and ( iii ) an infalling observer encounters nothing unusual at the horizon . one of the proposed solutions to this paradox is that the infalling observer burns up at the horizon .",
    "a black hole firewall forms at the horizon for an old black hole and the correlations across the horizon are severed .",
    "recently this firewall state was modeled for a rindler horizon in minkowski spacetime by severing correlations across the horizon .",

    "the correlations across the horizon are severed by requiring the wightman function to be zero , disregarding the underlying dynamics .",
    "furthermore , a low - frequency cutoff in the wightman function was introduced , implying that correlations between high - frequency modes are cut whilst correlations between low - frequency modes are preserved .",
    "this is a warm firewall .",
    "we propose that a uniformly accelerated mirror is a possible mechanism for generating a rindler firewall . from the quantum circuit model",
    "we can see that the accelerated mirror acts as a pair of scissors cutting the correlations across the past horizon .",
    "if the mirror is perfect , the correlations across the horizon are completely severed and the particle flux along the horizon is divergent .",
    "this is a hot firewall , destroying everything that crosses it .",
    "however , if the mirror is not perfect but transparent for low - frequency modes , the high - frequency correlations are cut while low - frequency correlations are preserved , and the particle flux in a localized wave packet mode along the horizon is finite , similar to the warm firewall proposed by louko @xcite . in sec . [ squeezing ]",
    ", we showed that the radiation field from the accelerated mirror is squeezed , which implies that the rindler firewall is squeezed .",
    "it seems that squeezing is a general property of a rindler firewall because in order to form a firewall one has to cut the correlations across the horizon , which inevitably generates single - mode squeezing .",
    "is a black hole firewall squeezed ?",
    "black hole firewalls are introduced in order to preserve the unitarity of black hole evolution @xcite . for an old black hole , the late time hawking radiation",
    "should be correlated with early time hawking radiation but not with the degrees of freedom inside the event horizon .",
    "the correlations across the horizon are severed during the evaporation . according to the arguments for the rindler firewall , it is reasonable to conjecture that the black hole firewalls are also squeezed .",
    "in addition , if the single - mode squeezing is strong enough , black hole firewalls do not have to be entangled with other unknown systems .",
    "we have developed a quantum circuit formalism to describe unitary interactions between a uniformly accelerated object and the quantum fields .",
    "the key point is to work in the accelerated frame where the object is stationary and couples only to rindler modes in one of the rindler wedges .",
    "if the initial state of the quantum fields is given in the inertial frame and the response of inertial detectors is considered , we have to transform modes from the inertial frame to the accelerated frame , which turns out to be a two - mode squeezing operation if we consider unruh modes instead of minkowski modes in the inertial frame .",
    "we thus can construct a quantum circuit using two - mode squeezers and devices depending on the interaction of the object with the rindler modes .",
    "as an example , we studied a uniformly accelerated mirror . in the accelerated frame ,",
    "the mirror is stationary and is simply a beamsplitter with frequency dependent reflection coefficient .",
    "the input - output relation of a beamsplitter is well known and is widely used in quantum optics @xcite . the quantum circuit for the uniformly accelerated mirror is shown in fig .",
    "[ circuit : fig ] . as an application , we calculated the radiation flux from an eternally accelerating mirror in the minkowksi vacuum .",
    "we found that the particles are localized around the horizon and the particle number in a localized wave packet mode is divergent if no low frequency regularization is introduced .",
    "our results are consistent with earlier results obtained using different methods @xcite .",
    "the infrared divergence occurs due to the ideal assumption that the mirror accelerates for an infinitely long time .",
    "we emphasize that the infrared divergence is not due to the particular pathological character of a massless scalar field in @xmath3-dimensional spacetime @xcite because it also appears in higher dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "we regularize the radiation flux by introducing a low - frequency cutoff for the mirror , that is , the mirror is completely transparent for low frequency field modes .",
    "physically , this is equivalent to having the mirror interact with the field for a finite time .",
    "after regularizing the infrared divergence , the particle number of a localized wave packet mode is finite .",
    "however the energy of the wave packet mode does not decay as the central frequency increases , in turn implying that the total energy of the radiation flux is infinite .",
    "this ultraviolet divergence arises because of the naive assumption that the mirror is accelerated eternally so that it appears to inertial observers when they cross the past horizon .",
    "if the mirror slowly increased its acceleration or was switched on smoothly , the number of high frequency particles would be suppressed , removing this ultraviolet divergence .",
    "using perturbation theory it is straightforward to show that the energy flux is finite if the mirror is smoothly turned on and off @xcite .",
    "a further application of our circuit model would be in the study a uniformly accelerated cavity .",
    "previous work on this topic @xcite studied how the quantum states stored inside a perfect cavity are affected by uniform acceleration .",
    "while unruh - davies radiation @xcite can not affect the field modes inside a perfect cavity , it can affect field modes inside an imperfect one . because the circuit model is designed to study an imperfect uniformly accelerated mirror",
    ", we believe that by generalizing the model from one mirror to two mirrors , one can study the interaction between unruh - davies radiation and the field modes inside an imperfect cavity .",
    "one limitation of our circuit model is that it is only suitable for studying hyperbolic trajectories in minkowski spacetime ; more general trajectories are not straightforwardly incorporated .",
    "one might expect this to severely limit the utility of the circuit model because physically it is not possible to accelerate a mirror for an infinitely long time .",
    "however our use of the transparency term shows that we can turn on and off the mirror so that it is transparent in the distant past and distant future .",
    "this could be used to model a mirror that initially undergoes inertial motion , accelerates for a finite period of time , and then returns to inertial motion .",
    "we will leave this topic for future work .",
    "we find that the radiation flux from the uniformly accelerated mirror is squeezed . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the contribution of single - mode squeezing to the generation of particles by a moving mirror has not been discussed previously .",
    "the squeezing angle depends on the central frequency and position of the localized detector mode function .",
    "maximum squeezing occurs when the detector mode function centers on the horizon .",
    "it is clear from the circuit model that the squeezing is related to the correlations across the horizon . when the mirror is completely transparent , the correlations across the horizon are preserved and there is no squeezing .",
    "when the mirror completely reflects a rindler mode with a particular frequency , it destroys the correlation across the horizon and generates some squeezing in the minkowski mode .",
    "it therefore provides a mechanism for transferring the correlations across the horizon to the squeezing of the radiation flux on the horizon .",
    "recently , louko @xcite proposed a rindler firewall state by severing the correlations across the horizon by hand and claimed that the response of a particle detector is finite .",
    "it was subsequently shown that entanglement survives this rindler firewall @xcite .",
    "our calculation suggests that one way of generating a rindler firewall is to uniformly accelerate a mirror .",
    "we conjecture that if the firewall is formed in an old black hole , the radiation flux at the horizon could be squeezed as the price of severing the entanglement across the event horizon .",
    "in addition , the black hole firewall may not need to be highly entangled with other systems @xcite because the squeezing may be enough to account for the particle flux on the horizon .",
