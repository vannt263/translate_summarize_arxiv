    "in order to explore physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , indirect searches play an important role complimentary to direct searches of new particles at high energy frontiers .",
    "the indirect searches include flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) and the muon anomalous magnetic moment . in the minimal sm ,",
    "lepton flavor is conserved and fcnc is forbidden at tree level , so that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay experiments have supplied severe constraints on models beyond the sm . at the recent bnl e821 experiment , it was reported that the muon anomalous magnetic moment had 2.6 @xmath10 deviation from the sm prediction @xcite . if the deviation is confirmed by improvement in both statistics and understanding theoretical uncertainty of the sm prediction , the muon anomalous magnetic moment becomes a clear signal of physics beyond the sm .    among candidates of the physics beyond the sm , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is the most attractive one . because of the cancellation of quadratic divergence in the renormalization of the higgs field , susy models do not have the hierarchy problem of the sm .",
    "furthermore , the gauge coupling unification is realized in the susy grand unified theories ( susy gut ) based on su(5 ) gauge group or its extensions .    in view of the flavor physics ,",
    "it is important that the scalar partners of quarks and leptons , namely squarks and sleptons , have a new source of flavor mixing . due to the new flavor mixing , lfv and fcnc such as @xmath2 , @xmath11  and @xmath0/@xmath12  mixing",
    "could be induced through susy loop diagrams .",
    "because these processes receive too large contributions for generic flavor mixing in squark and slepton sector , the structure of susy breaking sector of the lagrangian is required to have a special form , unless the masses of the susy particles are beyond multi - tev region @xcite . the simplest possibility to avoid",
    "this problem is that the susy breaking mechanism is assumed to be flavor blind .",
    "however , even in such a case , the squark and slepton mass matrices receive radiative corrections from interactions below the scale where the susy breaking is originated , and flavor blindness is broken @xcite . in particular , effects of the large top yukawa coupling constant can not be neglected .",
    "a number of analyses have been done in the context of minimal supergravity ( minimal sugra ) anzats where susy breaking parameters are assumed to be flavor blind at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the flavor mixing is controlled by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element . as a result",
    "the maximal deviation from the sm in the cp violating parameter of @xmath0  mixing , @xmath1 , and @xmath13/@xmath14  mixing is of the order of 10  % , while the susy contribution to @xmath11  process can be much important @xcite . in the gut scenario ,",
    "there are additional contributions to fcnc / lfv processes from gut interactions @xcite . as for lfv processes the @xmath2  branching ratio",
    "is close to the current experimental bound , especially for so(10 ) model @xcite .",
    "recent experimental evidences of neutrino oscillation indicate existence of small neutrino mass and large flavor mixings in the lepton sector @xcite . a natural explanation for small neutrino mass is the seesaw mechanism @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced , and these neutrinos have majorana mass term and new yukawa interactions . because the neutrino yukawa coupling constants can be as large as the top yukawa coupling constant if the right - handed neutrinos are @xmath15 gev , radiative corrections from these interactions contribute to the renormalization of slepton mass matrix above the mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos . within the minimal sugra scenario , it was shown that the branching ratios of lfv processes becomes large enough to be measured in near - future experiments @xcite . some gut models which have predictable neutrino mass and mixing",
    "are already constrained @xcite . in the context of susy gut",
    ", these new interactions in the lepton sector also contribute to the quark sector , because radiative corrections on the squark from neutrino interactions can become a new source of quark fcnc processes as well as the lfv processes .",
    "recently , these processes are analyzed in the minimal su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrino and large deviations from the sm are predicted @xcite .",
    "however , in these analyses , simple flavor structure was assumed so that the correct mass relations between the down - type quarks and charged leptons in the first and second generations can not be realized .",
    "very recently , the bnl e821 experiment reported a new result on the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "the measured value of @xmath16 is @xmath17 , which is compared to the sm prediction @xmath18 .",
    "it was concluded that the theory and experiment had 2.6 @xmath10 difference @xmath19 .",
    "the deviation can be explained in the context of the susy model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lfv and fcnc processes which are very sensitive to the origin on the flavor mixing at high energy scale , the muon anomalous magnetic moment can provide us information on the slepton masses , rather independent of the flavor structure of the slepton mass matrices .    in this paper , we discuss fcnc / lfv processes in the su(5 ) supersymmetric grand unified theory with right - handed neutrino ( su(5)rn susy gut ) taking account of realistic mass relations .",
    "the seesaw mechanism generates small neutrino masses and large mixing angles which incorporate atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies . in order to reproduce realistic mass relations",
    ", we introduce a higher dimensional operator including * 24 * superfield which gives contributions to the yukawa coupling matrices for the down - type quarks and the charged leptons in a different manner .",
    "moreover , new degrees of freedom arise in the choice of the bases when the mssm multiplets are embedded in the su(5 ) multiplets .",
    "we show that the main effect of these new mixings is described by two mixing angles which parameterize rotations of the bases between the down - type quarks and charged leptons in the first and second generations .",
    "we perform numerical analysis on fcnc / lfv processes taking account of various sources of flavor mixing .",
    "we also calculate the muon anomalous magnetic moment and investigate the correlations among these quantities . solving renormalization group equations for the yukawa coupling matrices and the susy breaking parameters , the flavor mixing in the squark and slepton sectors is evaluated at the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "in addition to the muon anomalous magnetic moment , we calculate following fcnc / lfv observables : the branching ratios of @xmath2 , @xmath6  and @xmath11 , @xmath1 , the mass differences in @xmath13  mixing and @xmath14  mixing , and the time - dependent cp asymmetries of @xmath4  and @xmath20  where @xmath21 is a cp eigenstate including a strange quark .",
    "we find that the susy contributions to @xmath1 , the @xmath2  branching ratio , and the muon anomalous magnetic moment become large in a wide range of parameter space . within the current experimental bound on @xmath3 , large susy contributions are possible either in the muon anomalous magnetic moment or in @xmath1 . in the former case , the favorable value of the recent muon anomalous magnetic moment measurement at the bnl experiment can be accommodated . in the latter case , the new contribution @xmath1  modifies the constraint for the ckm matrix elements and affects @xmath7 decay observables because allowed region of @xmath22  and the time - dependent cp asymmetry of the @xmath4  mode can be quite different from that of the sm or mssm without the new flavor mixing source .",
    "we also show that @xmath23  and the indirect cp asymmetry of the radiative @xmath7 decay can be large in the case where the neutrino parameters correspond to the small mixing angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution .",
    "we also notice that the branching ratio of @xmath2  can be close to the present experimental upper limit both in the large and small mixing angle msw solutions .",

    "<S> motivated by the large mixing angle solutions for the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies , flavor changing neutral current processes and lepton flavor violating processes as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment are analyzed in the framework of su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrino . in order to explain realistic mass relations for quarks and leptons , we take into account effects of higher dimensional operators above the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the supersymmetric ( susy ) contributions to the cp violation parameter in @xmath0  mixing , @xmath1 , the @xmath2  branching ratio , and the muon anomalous magnetic moment become large in a wide range of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate correlations among these quantities . within the current experimental bound of @xmath3 , large susy contributions are possible either in the muon anomalous magnetic moment or in @xmath1 . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> the favorable value of the recent muon anomalous magnetic moment measurement at the bnl e821 experiment can be accommodated . in the latter case , the allowed region of the kobayashi - maskawa phase can be different from the prediction within the standard model ( sm ) and therefore the measurements of the cp asymmetry of @xmath4  mode and @xmath5could discriminate this case from the sm . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the @xmath6  branching ratio can be close to the current experimental upper bound and the mixing induced cp asymmetry of the radiative @xmath7 decay can be enhanced in the case where the neutrino parameters correspond to the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein small mixing angle solution . </S>"
