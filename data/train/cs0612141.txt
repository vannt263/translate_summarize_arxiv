    "system availability and failure frequency are important performance indices of a repairable system @xcite , from which other key parameters such as the mean time between failures , average failure rate , birnbaum importance , etc . may be deduced . in the steady - state regime ,",
    "the frequency of system failure was first calculated by a cut - set @xcite or a tie - set approach @xcite in the case of statistically independent failures , which will also be considered here .",
    "these approaches are based on the inclusion - exclusion ( ie ) principle , where the failure or repair rates ( more generally , the inverses of the mean down or up times ) , are adequately given for each term of the relevant expansion .",
    "when all the terms of its ie expansion are kept , the exact availability is obtained as a function of each component availability .",
    "several papers have provided a few simple recipes , describing how the system failure frequency and the failure rate can then be derived @xcite .",
    "recent refinements have been proposed when availability expressions are obtained from various instances ( svi , gvi ) of sum - of - disjoint - products algorithms @xcite .",
    "all these formal calculations boil down to a simple fact : the failure frequency may be derived from the availability through the application of a linear differential operator @xcite .",
    "this requires knowledge of the exact availability , which is hard to come by except for trivially small networks , and may have hindered the use of this method .",
    "unsurprisingly , several algorithms have been put forward , in which availability and failure frequency are computed side by side in a common procedure : triangle - star transformation @xcite , obdd calculations @xcite , and another instance of differential operator calculations @xcite .    in this paper , we want to promote the differential operator method for the calculation of the failure frequency by showing it gives the exact result for numerous , widely used configurations , with an _ arbitrary large _ number of components .",
    "we take advantage of recent results establishing that the availability of recursive networks may be expressed as a product of transfer matrices that take each edge and node availabilities exactly into account @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ general procedure ] , we show how the failure frequency of a system may generally be deduced from the steady - state availability when the latter is expressed by a product of transfer matrices .",
    "we first apply this method in section [ koutofn ] , which is devoted to @xmath0-out - of-@xmath1 systems ( either @xmath0-out - of-@xmath1:g or linear consecutive @xmath0-out - of-@xmath1:f ones ) with distinct components .",
    "section [ simpleladder ] provides a generic example for the two - terminal failure frequency of a simple ladder network , which has been solved recently for arbitrary edge and node availabilities @xcite ; the same procedure could easily be used for more complex networks and their all - terminal reliability too @xcite . in each configuration , we pay attention to the case of identical components , for which the common availability is @xmath2 ( for edges ) and @xmath3 ( for nodes ) . for large systems , we show that the asymptotic failure rate has a linear dependence with size , and is given by derivatives of the largest eigenvalue of the unique transfer matrix with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude by a brief outlook .",
    "in many systems , as will be explicitly shown in the following sections , the availability @xmath4 ( or the unavailability @xmath5 ) is given by an expression of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a transfer matrix , the elements of which are multilinear polynomials of individual component availabilities , and where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two vectors in which these availabilities do not appear .",
    "the mean failure frequency @xmath10 is obtained from @xcite @xmath11 in order to avoid unnecessarily heavy notation , we call @xmath12 the matrix obtained by applying the linear differential operator @xmath13 to @xmath14",
    ". therefore , @xmath15 since @xmath14 s elements are at most linear functions of each @xmath16 , the derivation of @xmath12 is straightforward .",
    "for instance , a matrix element @xmath17 in @xmath14 would give rise to @xmath18 ; the recipes given in @xcite fully apply .    both availability and failure frequency",
    "may be obtained in a single pass in the following way .",
    "let us initialize the procedure by setting @xmath19 the recursion equations are @xmath20 from which we deduce the final results @xmath21 we can now turn to a few ` real - life ' applications .",
    "@xmath0-out - of-@xmath1 systems are widely used , in various configurations ; they have therefore contributed to a huge body of literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we start our discussion with these systems because each transfer matrix actually refers to a single equipment only .",
    "we first consider the simple @xmath0-out - of-@xmath1:g system , where each component has an availability @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) . to operate as a whole , the system needs at least @xmath0 elements to function .",
    "its availability @xmath23 may be written as ( see @xcite , p. 244 ) @xmath24 with @xmath25 we have reduced the size of the matrix to a @xmath26 one , instead of the original @xmath27 , because of the nature of @xmath28 and @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ availabilitykout - of - n ] ) .",
    "the ` derivative ' of @xmath29 is @xmath30 so that the computation of the failure frequency following the method given in section [ general procedure ] is straightforward ( care should of course be taken of the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ availabilitykout - of - n ] ) ) .",
    "let us revisit example 7.2 of @xcite ( see p. 245 ) for the 5-out - of-8:g system with @xmath16 = 0.90 , 0.89 , ... , 0.83 . assuming a unique repair rate for all components , namely @xmath31 , the failure rates @xmath32 are such that @xmath33 . from the procedure detailed in section [ general procedure ] , we deduce @xmath34 and a failure frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the failure rate @xmath36 is then equal to @xmath37 .",
    "when all components are identical ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , only one transfer matrix appears .",
    "admittedly , @xmath23 is so simple that a matrix formulation is hardly necessary .",
    "nonetheless , we can give a compact expression for the generating function @xmath40 ( the derivation is given in the appendix ) : @xmath41 since the generating function is a formal power - series expansion , we can apply the linear differential operator @xmath42 to eq .",
    "( [ gkoutofn : g ] ) so that @xmath43 is easily found to be @xmath44 which is another formulation of the well - known result @xmath45 ( eq .",
    "( 7.10 ) of @xcite , p. 234 ) .",
    "these systems have been studied in many papers @xcite and a recent textbook @xcite .",
    "the reliability @xmath46  the probability of operation of a system of @xmath1 components , which fails if at least @xmath0 _ consecutive _ elements fail  of such a system is given by ( see also eq .  ( 9.48 ) of @xcite , p. 344 ) @xmath47 with @xmath48 here again , we have reduced the size of the matrix and the vectors with respect to their original formulation .",
    "consequently , @xmath49 leading once again to a straightforward calculation of the failure frequency .",
    "a numerical application may be found in the lin / con/4/11:f model , as in example 9.6 of @xcite , where the @xmath16 s range from 0.7 to 0.9 by steps of 0.02 .",
    "assuming again that the repair rate for each equipment is @xmath31 , we get @xmath50 and a failure frequency @xmath51 . the corresponding failure rate is then equal to @xmath52 .",

    "( [ glinconkoutofn : f ] ) to obtain the failure frequency generating function is straightforward , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we consider in this section the two - terminal availability of a simple ladder network , displayed in fig .",
    "[ deuxechelles ] , where successive nodes are labelled @xmath54 or @xmath55 , and where the larger black dots mark the source @xmath56 and terminal @xmath57 .",
    "this network is a simplified description of a standard architecture for long - hail communication networks : it consists in primary and backup paths , plus additional connections between transit nodes enabling the so - called `` local protection '' policy by bypassing faulty intermediate nodes or edges .",
    "such an architecture of `` absolutely reliable nodes and unreliable edges , '' with up to 25 edges , was chosen as example 5 in @xcite for a comparison of different `` sum of disjoint products '' minimizing algorithms , or by rauzy @xcite as well as kuo and collaborators in obdd test calculations @xcite .",
    "we showed @xcite that the two - terminal availability has a beautiful algebraic structure @xcite , since its exact expression is given by a product of @xmath58 transfer matrices ( see eqs .",

    "it is worth noting that all five availabilities of the @xmath71 `` cell '' or building block of the network appear in a single transfer matrix @xmath66 , which is not sparse , contrary to the matrices of section [ koutofn ] .",
    "equations  ( [ reliabilitysn][reliabilitymn ] ) apply to the most general ladder in terms of individual availabilities . if an edge or a node is missing , its reliability @xmath16 should be set to zero , and its failure rate may be considered arbitrary , because it will not alter the final result . similarly ,",
