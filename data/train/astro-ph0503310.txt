    "gravitational lensing is a unique tool for exploring the distribution of matter , particularly that of dark matter .",
    "the recently discovered largest separation lensed quasar , sdss  j1004 + 4112 @xcite , has opened a new window for probing dark matter distributions in the universe .",
    "the quasar was discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the lensing hypothesis was confirmed by subsequent observations with the subaru 8.2-m telescope and the keck telescope .",
    "the system consists of four lensed quasar components ( @xmath018.5 , 18.9 , 19.4 , and 20.1 ) at @xmath1 and the maximum separation angle between the lensed images is @xmath2 .",
    "the lensing object must be a massive object , such as a cluster of galaxies , to produce such a large image separation ; indeed , we have identified a @xmath3 cluster centered among the four lensed images .",
    "the discovery of a single , cluster - size lensed quasar among the current sdss quasars is consistent with the theoretical expectation of lensing based on the cold dark matter model @xcite .",
    "sdss  j1004 + 4112 is unique in the sense that 1 ) the quadruple images place robust constraints on the innermost region of the lensing cluster , and 2 ) the lensing cluster is a _",
    "strong lensing selected _ cluster of galaxies .",
    "these features indicate that the mass modeling of this lens system may offer valuable information on the structure of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the first attempt at modeling the system with various parametric models revealed the elongated and complicated mass distribution of the lensing cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently studied this system using a free - form reconstruction technique and reached similar conclusions .",
    "however , important degeneracies between different models remain , and further follow - up observations are required to determine the mass distribution more precisely .",
    "observations using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) can offer such new data .",
    "in particular , high - resolution _ hst _ images could be quite effective at detecting lensed images of the quasar host galaxy , arc or arclet images of other lensed sources , and perhaps a central or `` odd '' image of the lensed quasar system that would be expected theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a central image is especially useful for providing tight constraints on the central mass distribution of the lensing object .",
    "this was indeed demonstrated by the first discovery of a central image in a lensed quasar system ; @xcite showed that the central image of pmn  j1632@xmath40033 requires @xmath5 ( @xmath6 confidence ) when a power - law density profile @xmath7 is assumed .",
    "possible central images have also been identified in lensed arc systems , such as cl 0024 + 1654 @xcite , ms 2137.3@xmath42353 @xcite , and a1689 @xcite , and they also provide important constraints on mass models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present an identification of a fifth image of the lensed quasar with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) and the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ; @xcite ) installed on the _",
    "hst_. in addition , we report unambiguous detection of the lensed host galaxy in the nicmos image .",
    "an acs observation ( with the wide field channel ) in the f814w filter ( @xmath8-band ) was conducted on 2004 april 28 , under the program `` _ hst _ imaging of gravitational lenses '' ( go-9744 , pi c.  kochanek ) .",
    "the observation consisted of five dithered exposures taken in accum mode .",
    "the total exposure time was 405 seconds .",
    "the reduced ( drizzled and calibrated ) images were extracted using the calacs pipeline @xcite , which includes the pydrizzle algorithm .",
    "we further rejected cosmic rays using the l.a.cosmic package @xcite in the drizzled image .",
    "a @xmath9 subsection of a median of the five dithered images is shown in figure [ fig : acs ] . following figure  9 of @xcite",
    ", the four lensed components are denoted as `` a ",
    "d '' , and three central bright galaxies of the lensing cluster are denoted as `` g1g3 '' .",
    "the redshifts of galaxies g1g3 are 0.680 , 0.675 , and 0.675 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the relative positions of components a  d were calculated by a single gaussian fit , and the flux ratios of components a  d were estimated by fitting the psf stars produced by the tiny tim software ( version 6.1a ; @xcite ) , in the drizzled ( and cosmic ray rejected ) image .",
    "the psf of a quasar was constructed with an @xmath10 power law spectrum in the f814w wavelength region ( corresponding to @xmath113000  in the rest frame ) .",
    "the relative positions derived from the acs ( f814w ) are consistent with those derived from the subaru @xmath12 band image @xcite within @xmath13 .",
    "the four components are all unsaturated , and the ab magnitude of component a in the f814w filter is estimated to be 18.4 .",
    "the position of component g1 was extracted by the source extractor algorithm @xcite .",

    "the nicmos imaging observation was also conducted under the same _ hst _ program on 2004 october 9 .",
    "the observation consists of four dithered exposures taken in multiaccum mode , using the f160w filter ( @xmath17-band ) .",
    "the exposure time was 640 sec for two of the exposures and 704 sec for the other two .",
    "the calibration was extracted by the calnica pipeline , and the central bad columns of each dithered image were corrected by linear interpolation .",
    "the combined image is shown in figure [ fig : nicmos ] .",
    "first , we confirm a galaxy near component a ( marked as g4 in figure [ fig : nicmos ] ) , which may host the star or stars responsible for microlensing of the broad emission line region @xcite .",
    "in addition , extended emission is clearly seen around components a , b and c. although such extensions are also seen in the acs images ( see figure [ fig : acs ] ) , their existence is much more robust in the nicmos image .",
    "the fact that these extensions are obvious in the f160w ( near - infrared ) image and faint in the f814w ( optical ) image , and that the distortions agree with the theoretical critical curves ( see figure 17 of @xcite ) , demonstrates that the extended flux is due to the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar .",
    "these images provide many new constraints on lens models that will significantly improve our ability to determine the mass distribution of the lensing cluster .",
    "they do make lens modeling more computationally intensive ( because one must account for the intrinsic shape of the host galaxy , and also for the effects of the point spread function ) , so we defer detailed modeling of the arcs to a subsequent paper .",
    "of interest is the existence of a point source near the center of g1 .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig : acsfifth ] shows the acs image of galaxy g1 ; what appears to be an unresolved source is clearly seen approximately 02 northwest of the center of g1 .",
    "_ this feature is neither a bad pixel nor a cosmic ray _ ; the source is seen in all dithered images .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : acsfifth ] displays the image after subtracting the signal from g1 ( modeled with the galfit package of @xcite ) . due to the existence of the unresolved source near the center of g1 (",
    "the peak flux of this unresolved source is almost same as that of g1 ) , g1 was slightly over - subtracted .",
    "however , we can see a new source , labeled e , in the subtracted image .",
    "this object is classified as a point source by the source extractor algorithm .",
    "the position and brightness of e , based on a single gaussian fit to the data , are given in table [ table : posflux ] .",
    "( 40mm,*)fig3a_inada.ps ( 40mm,*)fig3b_inada.ps    ( 40mm,*)fig4a_inada.ps ( 40mm,*)fig4b_inada.ps    we find component e also in the nicmos image ; the left panel in figure [ fig : nicfifth ] is the nicmos image of galaxy g1 .",
    "we subtracted the signal from g1 using the galfit package , which is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : nicfifth ] .",
    "we confirm component e in the subtracted image , although g1 was slightly over - subtracted as in the acs image .",
    "measuring the flux of component e with a single gaussian fit , we find that the flux ratios between e and a ( @xmath18 ) in the acs and nicmos images are 0.003 and 0.004 , respectively .",
    "this remarkable agreement of the flux ratios supports the idea that the point source is a fifth image of the lensed quasar .    to test this hypothesis , we have refined the lens models presented in @xcite using the more precise _ hst _ data .",
    "the models consist of a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution for galaxy g1 , and an nfw @xcite elliptical potential for the cluster .",
    "we demand that the models reproduce the relative positions and brightnesses of components a  d ( and the relative position of g1 ) , as well as the position of component e ; we do not use the brightness of e as a constraint , because we want to see what the models predict . adopting the same approach as @xcite",
    ", we use the _ lensmodel _ software @xcite for monte carlo sampling of the parameter space .",
    "there is a wide range of models consistent with the data , indicating that it is not difficult to produce a 5-image lens matching the configuration of components a  e , and that significant model degeneracies remain .",
    "more interesting are the model predictions for the flux ratio between the fifth image and component a , shown in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "the predictions span a remarkable nine orders of magnitude , from @xmath19 down to @xmath20 , but a significant fraction predict @xmath18 in the range 0.0010.01 , consistent with the observed value . in other words , there are ( many ) reasonable models that can fit all of the _ hst _ data under the hypothesis that e is a fifth image ; conversely , the observed properties of e are highly compatible with that hypothesis .    given the enormous range of model predictions for the brightness of e , it appears that the observed brightness offers strong constraints on the models .",
    "we caution that one must be careful in using the brightness of e as a constraint , because its measured flux could be contaminated by improper subtraction of the galaxy or by physical effects such as microlensing or extinction .",
    "nevertheless , the range of predictions is so large that even conservative estimates of systematic uncertainties should still yield very interesting results . as an example , to test the ability of e to constrain the central density profile of g1 , we switch from an isothermal model to a more general power law density profile @xmath7 for the galaxy ( for computational simplicity , we now assume that the _ potential _ , rather than the density , has elliptical symmetry ) .",
    "we find that there is a wide range of models with @xmath21 that predict @xmath22 .",
    "by contrast , all of the models we examined with @xmath23 predict @xmath24 , which grossly contradicts even a conservative reading of the data . in other words , the observed properties of e",
    "imply that the galaxy mass distribution can not be steeper than isothermal ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "this upper bound is similar to that found by @xcite from the central image in pmn j1632@xmath40033 ( specifically , they found @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , sdss j1004 + 4112 differs from pmn j1632@xmath40033 in that we do not obtain any _ lower _ bound on @xmath27 , at least over the range @xmath21 that we have explored so far .",
    "apparently the complexity of the sdss j1004 + 4112 lens potential , with a cluster in addition to the galaxy , prevents a unique measurement of the value of @xmath27 .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that component e provides important new constraints on the mass distribution of this interesting lens system .",
    "we have presented the _ hst _ acs and nicmos images of sdss  j1004 + 4112 , which reveal a fifth image of the lensed quasar core .",
    "the fifth image offers a unique probe of the mass distribution of the cluster core .",
    "deep spectroscopic observations of component e with large telescopes , such as the subaru telescope , offer the best prospect for the final confirmation that it is a lensed quasar image . in the nicmos image",
    ", we also found unambiguous evidence of the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar .",
    "these extended images provide strong additional constraints on mass models of the lensing cluster , which are expected to break degeneracies seen in the modeling studies to date . a detailed analysis of lens models including the host galaxy images is underway and will be presented elsewhere .",
