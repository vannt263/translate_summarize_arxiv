    "calcium ions are ubiquitous mediators of metabolic change in many cellular systems . in the cortex",
    ", it is believed to be the primary chemical signal for the induction of bidirectional synaptic plasticity @xcite , which is widely accepted to be the basis for many forms of learning , memory and development .",
    "experimentally , bi - directional synaptic plasticity can be induced by various different induction protocols @xcite , including the recently characterized spike - time - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) @xcite . in this induction method , if a presynaptic action potential occurs within a window of a few tens milliseconds _ before _ a postsynaptic action potential ( @xmath0 ) , long - term potentiation ( ltp ) is elicited ; if the order is switched ( @xmath1 ) , long - term depression ( ltd ) happens .",
    "interestingly , stdp and many other induction protocols share a common property , which is their dependence on the amount of integrated activation of the n - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( nmdar ) during conditioning .",
    "nmdar are natural coincidence detectors ; their activation relies both on the efficiency of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell , and on the level of depolarization of the postsynaptic cell .",
    "most remarkably , they are permeable to calcium ions , which suggests a functional link between calcium influx through nmdar and the induction of ltp and ltd .    recently , several dynamical models have been proposed to account for stdp @xcite , the relationship between stdp and rate - based models has been examined using averaging methods @xcite , and there have been attempts to account for receptive field formation on the basis of stdp @xcite .",
    "we have recently proposed a unified theory of synaptic plasticity @xcite based on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the level of intracellular calcium concentration determines the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity @xcite : when calcium falls below a threshold @xmath2 , no plasticity occurs , when it falls between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ltd is induced , and for calcium above @xmath3 , ltp is induced ; ( 2 ) the relevant sources of calcium are the nmda channels ; and ( 3 ) dendritic back - propagating action potentials ( bpaps ) contributing to stdp have a slow `` after - depolarizing '' tail component .",
    "we have shown that these simple assumptions are sufficient to account for the various experimental plasticity - induction protocols .",
    "in addition , this model has also produced previously uncharacterized predictions , such as : ( a ) the shape of the stdp learning curve should be frequency - dependent ; and ( b ) there should be a novel form of spike time - dependent ltd for @xmath5 larger than the ltp - inducing intervals .",
    "recent experimental results are consistent with these predictions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a systematic calculation of the calcium transients as a function of pre- and post - spike timings , as well as of the neuronal firing rates . in section [ sec : ca_dyn ] we derive the solution for the mean calcium transients , in the simplest case where the bpap consists of a single exponential , and show that its dependence on @xmath5 is rather intuitive .",
    "a more realistic approach is taken in section [ sec : ca_dyn2 ] , where the bpap is composed of a sum of two exponentials with different time constants .",
    "this more complex assumption is in closer agreement with our previous work @xcite and is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that the slow component contributes for different calcium levels in the baseline condition ( pre only ) and the post - pre condition ( @xmath6 ) , while the fast component sharpens the difference of the calcium levels in the transition between post / pre ( @xmath6 ) and pre / post ( @xmath7 ) conditions .",
    "the sharpness of this transition is shown to be further enhanced by the appropriate choice of the calcium decay time - constant . for completeness , in section [ sec :",
    "rate ] , we study the effects of calcium - accumulation due to repetitive firing which affects the rate - dependence of some plasticity - induction protocols including the stdp learning window . finally , in section [ sec : var ] we take into account the stochastic properties of synaptic transmission and estimate the trial - by - trial variability of the calcium transients",
    ". this variability can be significant if the number of postsynaptic nmdar in each spine is small .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that this variability depends @xmath5 ; increasing with @xmath5 for @xmath7 .",
    "these results could significantly alter the form of the stdp curve under different experimental conditions .",
    "the postsynaptic intraspinal calcium ions are removed from these compartments both through diffusion and through binding to calcium buffers .",
    "let these phenomena be characterized by a single time constant @xmath8 , and assume that the calcium dynamics follow a first - order linear differential equation ,    @xmath9}{dt}}=i(t)-\\frac{1}{\\tau}[ca ] .",

    "\\label{eq : ca_solution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that if the calcium current is a superposition of separate current sources , the calcium concentration can also be decomposed into such a sum .",
    "in this paper we consider the nmda channels as the sole source of calcium currents .",
    "these channels are voltage dependent @xcite , and have a long open time that can usually be described as a sum of two exponentials @xcite , thus its currents can be generally described as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the sets of times of pre- and postsynaptic action - potentials ( aps ) that occured prior to time @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mean total conductance of the population of nmdar in a synapse .",
    "the @xmath18-function represents the voltage dependence of calcium influx through nmdar , and @xmath19 is the fraction of nmdar in open state .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the time dependence of @xmath19 is a double exponential .    in this section , however , we will focus on the simple scenario of a single pair of pre and postsynaptic aps , where the dynamics of the nmdar and the bpap are described as single exponentials with time constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we will leave the more realistic two - component - bpap case to the next section .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , we replace the stochastic variable @xmath19 by its mean without change of notation . thus , for a single presynaptic spike at time @xmath24 , we can write ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the heaviside function and @xmath27 is the probability that a channel will open given a presynaptic ap .",
    "let us assume that the postsynaptic depolarization is dominated by the bpap .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 in equation [ eq : i ] can be written as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is resting membrane potential and @xmath31 is the magnitude of the bpap due to a postsynaptic ap occuring at time @xmath32 . in general",

    "[ eq : f ] through [ eq : h ] , equation [ eq : i ] becomes :    @xmath35    the current separates into two components , one that depends only on the timing of the presynaptic ap ( @xmath36 ) and a second , associative term , that depends on the relative timing between the pre- and postsynaptic aps ( @xmath37 )",

    "we showed that the peak of the calcium transients depends on the @xmath5 : for @xmath0 , the peak concentration decays with the time constant @xmath22 of the nmdar , and for @xmath1 , it decays with the time constant @xmath23 of the bpap . therefore , if spike time dependent plasticity , indeed depends on the calcium transients , @xmath22 and @xmath23 will determine the width of the pre - post ltp and the post - pre ltd windows , respectively .",
    "these results were confirmed by simulations , in which the approximations we used in the calculations were relaxed .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the peak calcium transient is similar in the more complex and realistic case where the bpap dynamics is composed of a fast and a slow component : the difference lies in the @xmath1 case , which now depends on the combination of the two time constants .",
    "the two - component bpap allows a sharper transition between the post - before - pre and the pre - before - post stdp window , which is further enhanced by a fast calcium dynamics .",
    "we also showed that , besides the timing of the pre and post - spikes , the peak values of the calcium transients also depend on the frequency @xmath78 of the pre and postsynaptic conditioning , increasing for greater values of @xmath78 .",

    "temporal integration of calcium transients , as described here , can explain why , in some cases , the induction of stdp is frequency - dependent .",
    "one of the predictions of the unified calcium model is that there exists a pre - before - post ltd for values of @xmath5 greater than the ones that elicit ltp @xcite .",
    "this has been shown experimentally by some investigators @xcite ; others have only placed a small number of data points in this region @xcite . in all published stdp experiments , there is a large variability in the magnitude and the sign of synaptic plasticity across the different values of @xmath5",
    ". it would therefore be difficult to assess the existence of this type of ltd without a large amount of data .",
    "the variability encountered in the experiments indicates that it should be important to examine the stochastic properties of the calcium transients , in addition to their mean .",
    "we calculated the variance of the calcium transients and showed that for a small number @xmath217 of nmdar , it can be quite significant .",
    "there are indications that the number of nmdar in the dendrite is indeed small ( @xmath126 ) @xcite .",
    "further , we showed that the @xmath209 increases monotonically with @xmath5 , for @xmath7 .",
    "these fluctuations can have significant implications on the outcome of downstream processes dependent on calcium , such as phosphorylation or other second - messenger cascades upon which plasticity relies .",
    "previously , several authors have simulated and analyzed dynamical models of synaptic plasticity that can lead to stdp @xcite .",
    "these models typically bypass detailed descriptions of the physiology and biochemistry underlying synaptic plasticity . recently ,",
    "biophysical models have been receiving increasing focus @xcite .",
    "these more mechanistic approaches have allowed one to show that various different induction protocols can be accounted for by a single set of assumptions regarding the dependence of plasticity on calcium concentrations @xcite . in these models , plasticity is a highly non - linear function of calcium .",
    "therefore , fluctuations of calcium transients will not only add spread to the resulting ltd and ltp , but will also shift their mean ( the mean of the solution is not equivalent to the solution given the mean calcium level ) . for example , in the unified calcium model @xcite , the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity is determined by a saturated u - shaped function of calcium concentration .",
    "when calcium falls below a threshold @xmath2 , no plasticity occurs , when it falls between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ltd is induced , and for calcium above @xmath3 , ltp is induced .",
    "thus , in the ltd region , if the spread of the calcium is of the order of @xmath218 , occasional ltp can still happen .",
    "we showed an explicit example for the cases of @xmath219 ms and @xmath220 ms , where the mean peak calcium concentrations are similar , but the variability for the latter is larger .",
    "if this mean calcium is in the ltd range , it is likely that the observed phenomenon is that the ltd is stronger and more robust for @xmath219 ms than for @xmath220 ms .",
    "this work is based on several simplifying assumptions .",
    "this allows us a qualitative understanding of the aspects of calcium dynamics that are crucial for the induction of synaptic plasticity .",
    "incorporation of more realistic features , such as those assumed in the unified calcium model , would probably yield quantitatively more precise results .",
