    "ideas for chiral quantum liquids in two - dimensional spin @xmath5 heisenberg models go back to the early days of frustrated magnetism,@xcite and they were motivated to a large extent by the physics of the quantum hall effect.@xcite these exotic spin states respecting spin rotation and lattice translation , but breaking time - reversal and mirror symmetries , are expected to show very unusual physical properties such as chiral edge modes , quantized thermal or spin hall effects,@xcite and bulk excitations with anyon statistics . while historically , a `` macroscopic '' time - reversal breaking was believed to be necessary for exotic phases to emerge ( e.g. , a uniform magnetic field as in the quantum hall effect ) , it was soon realized by haldane@xcite that net magnetic flux is not a mandatory ingredient .",
    "this line of thinking cumulated in the now very active research on topological quantum phases.@xcite recently , chiral spin liquids have regained a lot of attention,@xcite partly due to potential realization of such exotic phases in kapellasite and related materials.@xcite    at the heart of the spin liquid construction is fractionalization of spin in terms of _ spinons _ ,",
    "i.e. , effective low - energy quasiparticles carrying a fractional spin quantum number.@xcite this is in contrast to _ magnon _ excitations in spin wave theory@xcite of more conventional long - range ordered phases , which carry integer spin . at a formal level",
    ", spin can be written in terms of spinon operators,@xcite as we will discuss below .",
    "a physically interesting and highly nontrivial question is whether  in a concrete spin model ",
    "fractionalized spinons can emerge as quasi - free ( i.e. , deconfined ) excitations at low energy . in the case of confinement ( i.e. , local binding of spinon pairs ) , the bound state is nothing but a magnon excitation , and a conventional phase is realized .",
    "deconfined spinons are known to emerge in one - dimensional spin chains ,  @xcite but the central question remains whether this effect can carry over to higher dimensions .",
    "two - dimensional quantum spin models@xcite and materials@xcite with geometric frustration are strong contenders for such exotic phases .",
    "recently , an interesting study found evidence for spin fractionalization in an organic square - lattice compound at high energy.@xcite quantum spin liquids have also been proposed in three - dimensional hyperkagome systems.@xcite    the projective symmetry group  ( psg ) classification was introduced by wen@xcite on the square lattice for so - called _ symmetric _ liquids , i.e. , spin phases that do not break any lattice symmetry , spin rotation , nor time reversal .",
    "in essence , the psg classification seeks to list all possible classes of lattice symmetry representations in the enlarged hilbert space of fractionalized spinons.@xcite the discrete ( and finite ) number of these symmetry representations is then an enumeration and characterization of possible qsl phases .",
    "original work used a fractionalization in terms of _ fermionic _ spinons ( also known as `` abrikosov fermions'').@xcite an extension to the anisotropic triangular lattice was later addressed,@xcite but only recently psg classifications of symmetric liquids were published for honeycomb@xcite and kagome lattices.@xcite    other extensions have appeared in the literature.@xcite wang _",
    "et al._@xcite performed a classification of symmetric spin phases in the case of _ bosonic _",
    "fractionalization@xcite ( so - called  schwinger bosons \" ) on triangular , kagome , and honeycomb lattices .",
    "to some extent , this problem is simpler than the fermionic one , because the emergent gauge symmetry is u(1 ) instead of su(2 ) . when bosonic spinons condense , they give rise to conventional nel phases .",
    "otherwise , bosonic liquids always exhibit a spin gap and @xmath1 gauge fluctuations .",
    "a psg classification of chiral spin liquids within schwinger boson theory has been published by two of us and misguich.@xcite    the principal goal of our paper is to present the general theory of the projective symmetry group ( psg ) classification using fractionalization with fermionic spinons , in the case when lattice symmetries and spin rotation are preserved , except possibly some point group symmetries and time reversal . here , we generalize in a systematic way the notion of _ symmetric _ spin liquids to the one of _ chiral _ spin liquids  ( csls ) within the parton construction.@xcite in the latter case , we distinguish between _ kalmeyer - laughlin _ csls that break all reflection symmetries of the lattice , and _ staggered flux",
    "_ csls that break lattice rotation , up to time reversal . as an application of the general formalism",
    ", we list all quantum spin liquids for the triangular and kagome lattices . in these examples , we consider phases potentially realized in heisenberg models with exchange interactions up to _ third _ lattice neighbors",
    ". results from various approaches have recently suggested that novel chiral spin states can be expected in the presence of such long range interactions on those lattices.@xcite we hope that our exhaustive listing may trigger further investigations of microscopic spin models , potentially identifying some of the classified states as viable ground state candidates .",
    "this paper is meant to be largely self - contained in its core results . some of the presented material ( especially in sec .",
    "[ sec : frac ] ) may therefore be known to specialists , and is sometimes tacitly assumed in publications . to our knowledge , however , the explicit and general presentation of this paper is new , and can therefore be useful to a wider audience .",
    "we also provide a list of references for further reading , and we comment on recent developments in the field .",
    "for example , _ symmetric _ quantum spin liquids are merely special cases in our general framework , and their classification is included here .",
    "we take this opportunity to correct incomplete psg classifications of symmetric quantum spin liquids on the triangular lattice that have recently appeared in the literature.@xcite    we also discuss some general properties of the su(2 ) gauge fluxes characterizing a spin - rotation symmetric qsl that seem to be new . in the fully gauge invariant formalism",
    ", these fluxes have a far richer structure than the familiar u(1 ) gauge fluxes ( e.g. , of electromagnetism ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pop ] , we derive the spin order parameter corresponding to the su(2 ) gauge flux . for three - site loops ,",
    "the same result is obtained in the u(1 ) formalism,@xcite but it differs for higher - order loops . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorypsg ] , we further discuss symmetry constraints on the gauge flux , which turn out to depend on the projective representation class .",
    "in contrast to the simpler u(1 ) case , su(2 ) gauge fluxes are not trivially additive .",
    "that is , the total flux angle through a large lattice loop is , in general , not the sum of fluxes through elementary plaquettes .",
    "this fact is responsible for the absence of a `` cpt theorem '' in @xmath1 quantum spin liquids , i.e. , reflection symmetry combined with time reversal may be broken ( even if spin rotation is respected ) .",
    "we also comment on the chern number that can be nontrivial only in the case of kalmeyer - laughlin , but must vanish in staggered flux csl states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review some notation and results on the fermionic fractionalization of spin @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce quadratic spinon hamiltonians , and their characterization by su(2 ) gauge fluxes and the invariant gauge group  ( igg ) . in sec .",

    "[ sec : kagpsg ] , we present a microscopic quantum phase diagram for the antiferromagnetic @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 heisenberg spin model on the kagome lattice , and we relate to known results .",
    "we discuss equal - time spin structure factors and symmetry constraints on the spinon spectra for some of the found qsl phases .",
    "let us introduce the fermionic fractionalization of spin @xmath5 operators , and discuss the resulting emergent su(2 ) gauge structure .",
    "related fractionalization schemes have been discussed for higher values of spin,@xcite but systematic classification are open problems in these cases .    the spin one - half operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ; or @xmath8 ) can be written in terms of _ two _ flavors of complex fermions , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are pauli matrices.@xcite the fermions @xmath12 are called _",
    "spinon operators_. note that eq .",
    "is only formal , meaning that the operators on both sides follow the same su(2 ) commutation relations .",
    "however , they act in different hilbert spaces : spin space is @xmath13 , while the fermionic fock space is four dimensional .",
    "we call @xmath14 a _ spin doublet _ because of its transformation under su(2 ) spin rotation as @xmath15 .",
    "it follows from eq .   that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spinon occupation number . for spin one - half",
    ", we therefore see that the filling must be @xmath18 .",
    "states with other fillings , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , lead to @xmath21 . henceforth , we will call these fermionic states _ unphysical _ , because they do not correspond to spin states .",
    "the requirement @xmath22 is only one of three equivalent ways to specify the physical spin space .",
    "they are    [ eq : constr ] @xmath23    with @xmath24 the antisymmetric tensor . in the following",
    "it will be convenient to introduce a _ gauge doublet _ @xmath25 in analogy with eq .  , we define @xmath26 and the constraints are elegantly written as @xmath27 .",
    "the enlarged fermionic hilbert space leads to additional internal symmetries that are not present in spin space.@xcite for example , the u(1 ) phase of the spinon is clearly arbitrary , and @xmath29 does not affect the spin operator in .",
    "however , in the fermionic representation of spin @xmath5 , there is a further particle - hole redundancy . due to anticommutation , it is easy to see that a transformation @xmath30 does not affect the form of the spin operator .",
    "note that this symmetry is absent in bosonic fractionalization schemes .",
    "since these transformations do not commute , a particle - hole transformation can be preceded and followed by a phase change .",
    "this is compactly written in terms of the gauge doublet @xmath31 as @xmath32 and @xmath33 is an su(2 ) matrix .",
    "we call this a `` gauge transformation '' or su(2)@xmath28 , since it is _ local _ ,",
    "i.e. , it can be performed independently on each site of a lattice .",
    "note that the constraint @xmath34 in eq .",
    "transforms as a real vector under su(2)@xmath28 , while the spin @xmath35 is gauge invariant .",
    "conversely , it is easy to see that @xmath34 is spin - rotation invariant , while @xmath35 transforms as a vector .",
    "the additional gauge redundancy in spinon space means that there is some freedom in how physical ( spin ) symmetries act in the spinon hilbert space . a symmetry transformation ",
    "say @xmath36  may be accompanied by an su(2 ) gauge transformation @xmath37 .",
    "however , this choice is not arbitrary , since the gauge transformations must respect the algebraic relations among symmetry transformations . in mathematical terms",
    ", we say that the symmetry group is represented ( projectively ) in the spinon hilbert space .",
    "this is at the core of the psg classification and we will discuss it in more details later . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the representations of symmetries that act on a single site .      the antiunitary time reversal transformation @xmath38 inverts the spin direction , @xmath39 .",
    "for spin-@xmath40 operators , time - reversal is implemented as @xmath41 or @xmath42 in terms of the gauge doublet ( @xmath24 ) . however , in the present context it is convenient@xcite to supplement time reversal by a ( particle - hole ) gauge transformation @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "an advantage of this choice is that time reversal and gauge transformations manifestly commute : @xmath46 ; ( acting to the right).@xcite note that the choice is only a convenient starting definition , and additional gauge transformations ( denoted by @xmath47 ) may be associated with time reversal .",
    "however , for chiral spin liquids , we find that there is generally no relevant freedom in the representation of time reversal .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail below .    as discussed before ,",
    "spin rotation is implemented in spinon space as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the su(2 ) rotation matrix .",
    "recently , it was realized that spin rotation may also be implemented _ projectively _ , with an associated gauge transformation @xmath50 that is `` locked in '' with the su(2 ) spin rotation.@xcite this interesting possibility leads to a new class of _ majorana _ spin liquids and may shed light on alternative fractionalization schemes.@xcite in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to the case when spin rotation is represented linearly in spinon hilbert space ( i.e. , with trivial gauge transformation ) .",
    "a main goal of the psg construction is to investigate quantum heisenberg models @xmath51 on frustrated lattices , where fractionalized quantum phases are expected to arise .",
    "however , replacing the spin representation eq .   in the heisenberg model results in _",
    "spinon interaction terms , and not much is gained .",
    "progress can be made by mean - field decoupling the spinons through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and using a path - integral approach.@xcite to lowest order ( i.e. , at a saddle point ) , these approximations produce quadratic spinon theories that are then solvable . in this paper , we do not want to put emphasis on this approach .",
    "instead , we directly go to the quadratic spinon theory . _ a posteriori _",
    ", such a theory may be justified to describe the low - temperature phase of a particular microscopic spin model , e.g. , by using variational wave functions , as we will describe below .",
    "alternatively , the procedure can be viewed as a classification of possible symmetric saddle points for heisenberg models .",
    "the psg allows to classify and construct quadratic spinon hamiltonians @xmath52 that respect all or some symmetries of a given spin lattice model .",
    "such a spinon hamiltonian is conveniently written in terms of the gauge doublet @xmath53 as@xcite @xmath54 in the path - integral approach , the three real parameters @xmath55 are lagrange multipliers , enforcing the constraints .",
    "in the present context , they correspond to on - site spinon chemical potentials ( @xmath56 ) and complex @xmath57-wave pairing terms ( @xmath58 ) .    in general",
    ", the link matrices can be written as @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 are four complex parameters on each link . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath62^\\dagger = u_{ji}$ ] .",
    "equation   is the most general quadratic hamiltonian invariant under global spin rotations around @xmath63 .",
    "such a rotation acts as @xmath64 , and this is obviously a symmetry of .",
    "in fact , _ real _ parameters @xmath61 correspond to singlet , while _ imaginary _",
    "@xmath61 correspond to triplet hopping and pairing terms.@xcite    in this paper , we focus on the case when the full su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry is unbroken . to see that real @xmath61 conserve spin rotation , we may consider the generator around @xmath65 , @xmath66 . under this transformation ,",
    "the gauge doublet goes @xmath67 , hence @xmath68 is invariant . here",
    ", we have used the fermionic anticommutation and @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , it is clear that imaginary @xmath61 change sign under this spin rotation , so they correspond to triplet terms .",
    "particular sets of link and on - site parameters @xmath70 = [ u^\\mu_{ij}\\tau_\\mu , \\lambda^a_j\\sigma_a]$ ] are called a mean - field _ ansatz _ ( or _ anstze _ for plural ) . from now on ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to real @xmath61 with full su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry.@xcite in the widely used notation , the real parameters @xmath61 are written as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are complex hopping , and @xmath73 singlet pairing amplitudes on the link @xmath74 . in this language ,",
    "the ansatz reads @xmath75 and we have @xmath76 = - |\\xi_{ij}|^2 - |\\delta_{ij}|^2 $ ] .",
    "there are two important aspects of the spinon hamiltonian @xmath52 in eq .  .",
    "it is either viewed as a low - energy effective theory for quantum spin phases , or it may serve as a tool for constructing microscopic wave functions for rigorous variational energy calculations in spin models . either way , _ physical _ properties of a spin phase specified by @xmath52 are always independent of the chosen gauge .",
    "we denote the set of lattice gauge transformations by @xmath77 with @xmath78 . the su(2)@xmath28 transformations @xmath79 act independently on each site as @xmath80 . in terms of the ansatz @xmath81 ,",
    "the elements of @xmath82 act as @xmath83 \\mapsto g(u ) = [ g_i^\\dagger u_{ij } g_j ; g_j^\\dagger \\lambda_j g_j]\\ , .\\ ] ] different anstze are therefore unitary equivalent under gauge transformations .",
    "for example , the spectrum of @xmath52 is gauge invariant and therefore a characteristic of an equivalence class .    to construct microscopic spin wave functions from @xmath52 ,",
    "we proceed by taking the ground state @xmath84 of @xmath52 ( or excited states ) and remove unphysical components by applying the _ gutzwiller projector _",
    "@xmath85 $ ] , @xmath86 in the case of fermionic spinons , expectation values in such wave functions can efficiently be computed numerically using variational monte carlo  ( vmc ) techniques.@xcite this works best for singlet wave functions , because only slater determinants need to be evaluated . in the case of triplet pairing terms ,",
    "more resourceful calculation of pfaffians is generally required.@xcite in analogy with laughlin states for the quantum hall effect , these wave functions can be used in variational investigations of actual lattice spin models .",
    "apart from energetics , various other physically interesting properties may be calculated from the projected wave function , such as static or dynamic spin structure factors , excitation gaps , modular matrices , etc.@xcite    the _ invariant gauge group _  ( igg ) is an important concept in the phenomenology of quantum spin liquid phases when we view @xmath52 as a low - energy effective theory .",
    "it is defined as the subgroup of gauge transformations @xmath87 that leave the spinon hamiltonian @xmath52 invariant , i.e. , @xmath88 for all @xmath89  igg@xmath90 .",
    "igg@xmath90 always contains @xmath1 as a subgroup since global transformations @xmath91 leave any ansatz invariant .",
    "however , igg@xmath90 may be bigger and contain global u(1 ) or even su(2 ) transformations .",
    "the igg@xmath90 characterizes the emergent low - energy gauge fluctuations in the effective theory .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 ( sometimes called `` high - energy '' gauge group ) is completely broken to @xmath1 in the mean - field state , the emergent gauge bosons are gapped and expected to be irrelevant at low energy .",
    "however , in liquids with igg@xmath92  u(1 ) or su(2 ) , gapless gauge bosons ( `` photons '' or `` gluons '' ) are present and may strongly affect the low - energy physics .",
    "depending on the igg@xmath90 of its ansatz , a spin liquid is said to have a @xmath1 , u(1 ) , or su(2 ) gauge structure.@xcite in the first case , it is called a `` @xmath1 qsl state '' or simply `` @xmath1 liquid '' , etc .    as mentioned previously",
    ", a spinon hamiltonian may respect space group symmetries or time reversal when those transformations are accompanied by appropriate su(2 ) lattice gauge transformations in @xmath87 .",
    "the symmetries of an ansatz @xmath81 along with gauge transformations , sg@xmath93 , is called the _ invariant _ projective symmetry group , and denoted by psg@xmath90 .",
    "the psg@xmath90 is a way to distinguish between phases ( @xmath52 ) that have the same physical symmetries . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorypsg ] , we will explain the classification of those symmetry representations , without making reference to any ansatz @xmath81 ( this is the _ algebraic _ psg ) .",
    "the corresponding anstze are subsequently constructed .",
    "a useful way to characterize quadratic spinon hamiltonians @xmath52 is by their su(2 ) _ gauge fluxes_.@xcite given an ansatz @xmath81 , we associate the su(2 ) flux with oriented lattice ( wilson ) loops @xmath94 starting from a base site @xmath95 . the su(2 ) flux is defined as the matrix product of @xmath96 over the sites of the loop , @xmath97 lattice gauge transformations cancel out on the intermediate sites , but the su(2 ) flux depends on the gauge of the base site as @xmath98 . however  as we will discuss in more details later  trace and determinant of @xmath99 are gauge invariant and independent of the base site .    an interesting use of the su(2 ) flux is the determination of the invariant gauge group of an ansatz . as discussed previously , igg@xmath90 contains important information about the low - energy degrees of freedom and gauge structure of the theory . to determine the igg@xmath90 , we may proceed in the following way .",
    "let us pick a field @xmath100 on the link @xmath101 . for gauge transformations in igg@xmath90",
    ", we have @xmath102 by definition .",
    "this equation always has the solution @xmath103 , where we assume @xmath104 for simplicity .",
    "the same argument on a third site gives @xmath105 , etc .",
    "we can propagate the gauge transformation in igg@xmath90 to any site , @xmath106 . when the path is closed to a loop , the su(2 )",
    "flux matrix appears . for consistency reason",

    "the igg@xmath90 on this site is then the subgroup of su(2 ) that commutes with the flux matrices for all paths starting from that site.@xcite    a sufficient condition for all flux matrices to commute with a given gauge transformation is of course that all matrices @xmath96 commute with this gauge transformation .",
    "it is easy to see that there is always such a gauge .",
    "this condition is simpler to check than eq .  , and it is what we do in practice .",
    "next , we discuss some properties of the ansatz matrix @xmath59 . when @xmath61 are real for an su(2 ) spin rotation invariant ansatz , it can be written as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are real numbers , and @xmath114 is a unit vector . hence , @xmath115 = -\\rho_{ij}^2 $ ] and @xmath116 . using these properties of @xmath96 , we see that @xmath117|$ ] , and @xmath99 is ( proportional to ) a unitary matrix . it can therefore be written as @xmath118 ( \\sigma_3)^q g_j^\\dagger\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath79 some gauge transformation . here , @xmath119 is real , and @xmath120 is the number ( or parity ) of sites in the loop @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that @xmath121 = ( -)^q\\rho^2 $ ] , and the trace of the su(2 ) flux is given by @xmath122 hence , the trace is real for even - site loops , while it is imaginary for odd loops . for a given loop , the parameter @xmath119 ( as long as @xmath123 )",
    "can be changed by an irrelevant scaling @xmath124 , so it has no intrinsic physical meaning .",
    "however , the angle @xmath125 is an important gauge - invariant characteristics of the su(2 ) flux .",
    "let us contrast some properties of the su(2 ) flux with the more familiar case of a u(1 ) gauge flux .",
    "when the spinon hamiltonian @xmath52 only contains hopping terms and no pairing , we obviously have igg@xmath126  u(1 ) .",
    "in fact , whenever igg@xmath90 is u(1 ) , there is always a gauge in which the ansatz is pure hopping . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath127 , where @xmath128 are hopping amplitudes .",
    "the flux @xmath129 is invariant under local u(1 ) transformations , and it may be identified with @xmath125 in eq .  . however , we emphasize that only @xmath130 , resp .",
    "@xmath131 are invariant under the full su(2)@xmath132 lattice gauge group , and not the u(1 ) flux @xmath129 itself .",
    "for example , a global particle - hole transformation changes the sign of @xmath129 for even - site loops , and @xmath133 for odd loops .",
    "another interesting property of the su(2 ) flux angle @xmath125 in eq .",
    "is that it is _ nonadditive _ in general .",
    "consider two fluxes @xmath134 and @xmath135 on the loops @xmath136 starting from the same base site .",
    "then , the flux on the combined loop @xmath94 is the matrix product @xmath137 . in general",
    ", the flux angle @xmath125 for the combined loop is not the sum of the ones on @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "the angles are additive only in the special case when the flux matrices commute , @xmath141 .",
    "as expected , the flux angles are additive in u(1 ) liquids , i.e. , when igg@xmath126  u(1 ) and all @xmath99 obviously commute . in the absence of this additivity ( i.e. , in @xmath1 liquids ) , it is certainly _ not _ sufficient to specify flux angle patterns on elementary plaquettes of the lattice to characterize quadratic spinon hamiltonians .",
    "since we are primarily interested in _ chiral _ spin liquids , i.e. , states that break time - reversal symmetry , we need to understand how time reversal affects the su(2 ) gauge fluxes . our familiarity with the electromagnetic u(1 ) flux may mislead us to think that a nontrivial flux angle @xmath125 implies breaking of time reversal .",
    "however , this is only correct for odd - site loops . for the gauge choice",
    ", it is straightforward to show that the ansatz changes sign under time reversal , @xmath142 from the definition , it then follows that the su(2 ) flux on _ even - site _ loops is time - reversal invariant , while it changes sign for _ odd - site _ loops.@xcite as a result , an ansatz breaks time reversal if the flux angle @xmath125 is nontrivial ( @xmath143 ) on odd - site loops .",
    "a nontrivial su(2 ) flux can be threaded through even - site loops without necessarily breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "a well - known example of this rather surprising fact is the `` staggered flux '' state on the square lattice@xcite which is believed to be relevant to the pseudogap phase of cuprate high - temperature superconductivity . in this case ,",
    "a u(1 ) flux @xmath144 is threaded through the elementary plaquettes .",
    "an su(2 ) gauge rotation brings the staggered - flux ansatz to a pairing state with @xmath145-wave symmetry , which is manifestly time - reversal invariant.@xcite a more detailed discussion of the relation between time - reversal symmetry and physical observables will be given in sec .",

    "we want to explore which physical _ spin operator _  or order parameter  the su(2 )",
    "gauge flux corresponds to .",
    "equation   is the property of an ansatz @xmath81 , and it is not clear a priori what spin expectation value it stands for , if any . a closely related question has been addressed in the classic paper by wen , wilczek , and zee,@xcite where the authors considered the u(1 ) flux in the pure hopping formalism ( see appendix  [ app : u1flux ] ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the question has not been addressed in the general su(2 ) invariant framework . in the following , we present a formalism that includes both hopping and pairing terms on the same footing .",

    "in fact , a second gauge doublet is given by @xmath149 .",
