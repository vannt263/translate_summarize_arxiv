    "the question of the possibility for the spontaneous formation of a finite time singularity in solutions of the euler equation for an ideal incompressible fluid has been discussed for a long time . at present , this fundamental problem of fluid dynamics is still far from a complete solution , though some rigorous analytical results have been obtained .",
    "so , it has been found by beale , kato and majda @xcite , that no singularity occurs if the time - integral of the maximum of the vorticity magnitude is finite .",
    "another result ( constantin and co - workers , @xcite-@xcite ) postulates that a blow - up of the vorticity , if does take place , must be accompanied by a singularity in the field of the vorticity direction . in general , the nature of the presumed singularity has not yet been clarified , although many theoretical scenarios for blow - up have been suggested until now , and also extensive numerical simulations have been performed to observe the singular behavior ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", the locally self - similar regime of singularity formation seems very probable . for this regime , a region of finite size",
    "may be distinguished in flow , where all length scales , corresponding to vorticity distribution , decrease like @xmath6 , the velocity increases according to @xmath7 , and the maximum of the vorticity behaves like @xmath8 .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that this is the only possible scaling , which is compatible both with the dimensional structure of the euler equation and with the freezing - in property of the vorticity . in this process",
    ", an accelerated straining of vortex lines takes place , and it is the reason for amplification of the vorticity magnitude .",
    "it is very important that the curvature of vortex lines in the assumed self - similar solutions should tend to infinity in the vicinity of the singular point , in accordance with the result of constantin , fefferman and majda .",
    "thus , the problem of singularity in the curvature of vortex lines and the problem of singularity in their local stretching are closely connected .    in this paper , we take the point of view that infinite curvature of frozen - in vortex lines is in some sense a more fundamental characteristics of hydrodynamic singularity than infinite value of the vorticity maximum . to illustrate this statement",
    ", we consider a class of models of an incompressible inviscid fluid , different from eulerian hydrodynamics , such that finite energy solutions with infinitely thin frozen - in vortex filaments of finite strengths are possible .",
    "thus , we deal with a situation when the vorticity maximum is infinite from the very beginning , but nevertheless , this fact itself does not imply a singular behaviour in the dynamics of vortex strings , while their shape is smooth and the distance between them is finite .",
    "however , the interaction between filaments may result in formation of a finite time singularity for the curvature of vortex strings .",
    "it is the main purpose of present work to study this phenomenon analytically .",
    "it is a well known fact that absence of solutions with singular vortex filaments in eulerian hydrodynamics is manifested , in particular , as a logarithmic divergency of the corresponding formal expression for the energy functional of an infinitely thin vortex filament having a finite circulation @xmath9 and a shape @xmath10 ( this is actually the hamiltonian functional determining entirely the dynamics of the system , as is shown in section 2 ) : @xmath11 more important is that the self - induced velocity of a curved string in eulerian hydrodynamics is also infinite .",
    "this is the reason , why we can not work in the framework of eulerian hydrodynamics with such one - dimensional objects , that are very attractive for theoretical treatment .",
    "the situation becomes more favourable , when we consider a class of regularized models , with the divergency of the energy functional eliminated .",
    "it should be stressed here that in regularized systems the usual relation @xmath12 between the vorticity and velocity fields is no more valid , and in this case @xmath9 is not the circulation of the velocity around the filament , but it is the circulation of the canonical momentum field ( see section 2 for more details ) .",
    "however , dynamical properties of a de - singularized system depend on the manner of regularization .",
    "for instance , it is possible to replace the singular green s function @xmath13 in ( [ diverg ] ) ( where @xmath14 ) by some analytical function which has no singular points near the real axis in the complex plane ( for examples by @xmath15 or by @xmath16 ) . in that case",
    "we may not expect any finite time singularity formation , because the corresponding velocity field created by the vortex string appears to be too smooth with any shape of the curve , and this fact prevents drawing together some pieces of the string .",
    "with such a very smooth velocity field , a singularity formation needs an infinite time .    in this paper",
    "we consider another type of regularization of the hamiltonian functional , when the green s function is still singular , but this singularity is integrable in the contour integral analogous to the expression ( [ diverg ] ) : @xmath17 with a small but finite positive constant @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath1 is not small , we actually have models that are rather different from eulerian hydrodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , such models still have many common features with usual hydrodynamics , which are important for singularity formation in the process of the interaction between vortex filaments : a similar hydrodynamic type structure of the hamiltonian and a power - like behaviour of the green s function , with negative exponent .",
    "therefore we believe that it is useful to investigate these models , especially the question about the formation of a finite time singularity in the vortex line curvature .",
    "we hope the results of our study will shed more light on the problem of blow - up in eulerian hydrodynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review some basic properties of frozen - in vorticity dynamics in a perfect fluid , with giving necessary definitions for theoretical conceptions used in our study . in general , our approach is based on the hamiltonian formalism for frozen - in vortex lines @xcite-@xcite . then , in section iii , we perform the linear analysis of stability for a pair of symmetric anti - parallel vortex filaments and find an instability at small wave numbers analogous to the crow instability @xcite . in section iv , we postulate a local approximate hamiltonian for the long scale nonlinear dynamics of the pair of filaments and present analytical self - similar solutions of the corresponding equations .",
    "those solutions describe finite time singularity formation , with the length scales decreasing like @xmath4 , and this is the main result of present work . in section",
    "v , we make some concluding remarks about vortex filaments of a finite width , about long scale approximation for systems with the green s function of a general form , and finally about how it is possible to improve the approximation in the case of small @xmath1 , when the unstable region is narrow in wave number space . in appendix a , we write in terms of the special mathematical functions some integral expressions needed for calculation of instability increment of the vortex pair . in appendix",
    "b , we provide details about the integration procedure for the system of ordinary differential equations related to the self - similar solutions .",
    "to clarify the meaning of the suggested models ( [ h_alpha ] ) and to explain the employed theoretical method , we recall some general properties of frozen - in vorticity dynamics in a perfect fluid , starting from the lagrangian formalism @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "let a lagrangian functional @xmath19 specify the dynamics of some incompressible medium of unit density , with the solenoidal velocity field @xmath20 .",
    "especially we are interested here in systems with quadratic lagrangians , which in 3d fourier representation take the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some given positive function of the absolute value of the wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "this expression should be understood as the kinetic energy on the group of volume preserving mappings @xmath24 , and the velocity field @xmath25 is defined as the time derivative @xmath26 taken at the point @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , all the systems ( [ l_m ] ) possess the properties of homogeneity and isothropy in the space .",
    "it is clear that the usual eulerian hydrodynamics corresponds to the simplest case @xmath28 .",
    "another physically important example concerns the homogeneous incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics ( emhd ) , for which @xmath29 , with a constant @xmath30 beeng the screening parameter @xcite,@xcite . also the case @xmath31 has been studied , with a constant @xmath32 , which corresponds to the so called avereged eulerian hydrodynamics ( see , for instance , the papers @xcite , @xcite for more details ) . in the general case",
    ", the systems ( [ l_m ] ) may be understood as models for some inviscid non - newtonian fluids .",
    "it should be noted that there exists a direct relation between such models and the vortex blob method introduced by chorin for desingularization of the eulerian hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "some discussion of this relation , for the case of the averaged eulerian hydrodynamics , can be found in the papers @xcite and @xcite .    due to",
    "the presence of the noether type symmetry with respect to relabeling of lagrangian labels of fluid points @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , all such systems have an infinite number of integrals of motion , which can be expressed as conservation of the circulations @xmath33 of the canonical momentum field @xmath34 , @xmath35 along any closed contour @xmath36 advected by flow , thus the generalized theorem of kelvin is valid : @xmath37 these integrals of motion correspond to the frozen - in property of the canonical vorticity field @xmath38 , @xmath39 after defining the hamiltonian functional @xmath40 , @xmath41 the equation of motion for the vorticity takes the form @xmath42.\\ ] ] this equation describes the transport of frozen - in vortex lines by the flow having the velocity field @xmath43 it is very important in this process that all topological characteristics of the vorticity field are conserved @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ l_m ] ) , ( [ omega_definition ] ) and ( [ ham_definition ] ) , that the hamiltonian @xmath44 corresponding to the lagrangian @xmath45 is @xmath46 with the green s function @xmath47 being equal to the following integral : @xmath48    the frozen - in vorticity field can be represented in topologically simple cases as a continuous distribution of vortex lines @xcite-@xcite : @xmath49 where a 2d lagrangian coordinate @xmath50 , which lies in some manifold @xmath51 , is the label of a vortex line , while the longitudinal coordinate @xmath52 determines a point on the line .",
    "the important characteristics of the system : the ( virtual ) linear momentum @xmath53 and the angular momentum @xmath54 can be expressed as follows : @xmath55d\\xi , \\label{mom}\\\\ { \\bf m}&= & \\int_{\\cal n}d^2\\nu\\,\\,\\frac { 1}{3}\\oint { \\bf [ r\\times [ r\\times r}_\\xi]]d\\xi",
    ". \\label{anglmom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit , when the shapes @xmath56 of vortex lines do not depend on the label @xmath57 , we have one singular vortex filament with a finite circulation @xmath58 . in this case , the flow is potential in the space around the filament : @xmath59 , with a multi - valued scalar potential @xmath60 .",
    "the potential flow domain is passive from the dynamical viewpoint , because there the flow depends entirely on the filament shape .",
    "the dynamics of the shape @xmath61 of such infinitely thin vortex filament is determined in a self - consistent manner by the variational principle with the lagrangian @xmath62 @xcite-@xcite , @xmath63\\cdot { \\bf d}({\\bf r}))d\\xi -\\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}\\oint\\!\\!\\oint g_m\\left(|{\\bf r}(\\xi_1)-{\\bf r}(\\xi_2)|\\right)\\ , \\left({\\bf r}'(\\xi_1)\\cdot{\\bf r}'(\\xi_2)\\right)\\,d\\xi_1d\\xi_2,\\ ] ] where the vector function @xmath64 must have unit divergence @xcite : @xmath65 the generalization of the expression ( [ lgamma_m ] ) to a case of several filaments with the circulations @xmath66 and shapes @xmath67 , @xmath68 , is straightforward : one should write a single sum over @xmath69 for the first term and a double sum for the hamiltonian .",
    "it is easy to see that the hamiltonian ( [ h_alpha ] ) corresponds to the function @xmath22 in the form @xmath70    the choice of the longitudinal parameter @xmath52 is not unique , but this does not affect the dynamics of the vortex string which is an invariant geometric object .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to use parameterization of the vortex line shape by the cartesian coordinate : @xmath71 then the choice @xmath72 gives immediately that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are canonically conjugated quantities .    hereafter , we will consider vortex filaments with unit circulation for simplicity .",
    "so the symbol @xmath9 , if appearing in some expressions below , will mean the special mathematical gamma function .",
    "also , without loss of generality , all quantities may be considered as dimensionless .",
    "now , for some fixed value of the parameter @xmath1 , let us consider the symmetrical dynamics of a pair of oppositely rotating vortex filaments , with the symmetry plane @xmath75 . due to this symmetry , it is sufficient to consider only one of the filaments",
    ". it follows from the above discussion that the exact expression for the hamiltonian of this system is the following : @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mean distance between the two filaments ( @xmath78 does not depend on time because of the conservation law for the momentum ( [ mom ] ) ) , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and so on . the first term in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) describes the non - local self - interaction of the filament , while the second one corresponds to the interaction with the second filament .",
    "the hamiltonian equations of motion have the form @xmath81",
    "the system with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) possesses the exact stationary solution @xmath82 which describes the uniform motion of straight filaments . here",
    "the stationary velocity @xmath83 is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "but this solution appears to be unstable due to an analog of the crow instability @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider the linear evolution of small perturbations of the stationary solution , and derive the linear growth rate .    to perform the linear analysis of small deviations of the vortex shape from a straight line ,",
    "we need the quadratic part of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath85 } { |\\xi_1-\\xi_2|^{3-\\alpha}}\\,d\\xi_1 \\,d\\xi_2\\ ] ] @xmath86 } { \\big((\\xi_1-\\xi_2)^2+b^2\\big)^{\\frac{3-\\alpha}{2}}}\\,d\\xi_1 \\,d\\xi_2\\ ] ] @xmath87 for further consideration , it is useful to rewrite it in the 1d fourier representation : @xmath88    expressions for the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 follow from eq.([hquadratic ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath89 can be represented as follows : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 obviously , @xmath89 is positive everywhere .",
    "analogous calculations for the function @xmath90 give : @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 in appendix a , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are expressed through the euler gamma function @xmath98 and the modified bessel functions of the second kind @xmath99 .",
    "the dispersion relation between the frequency @xmath100 of a small amplitude perturbation of the filament shape and the corresponding wave number @xmath101 is simply given by the formula @xmath102 since the linearized equations of motion for @xmath103 and @xmath104 are @xmath105 as follows from eq.([ham_eqs ] ) . in fig.[ab",
    "] we have plotted @xmath106 versus @xmath101 for several values of @xmath1 .",
    "= 4.5 in = 2.5 in    it is easy to see that at small wave numbers the product @xmath107 is negative . indeed , after some calculations we obtain in leading order for @xmath108 : @xmath109 @xmath110 where the constant @xmath111 is given by the integral @xmath112 with @xmath113 being the gamma function .",
    "therefore , an instability takes place at small @xmath101 .",
    "the unstable domain in the wave number space corresponds to a range @xmath114 where @xmath90 is negative , with the function @xmath115 behaving , at small values of @xmath1 , like @xmath116 : @xmath117 the plot of @xmath115 is shown in fig.[q_0_alpha ] .",
    "= 4.5 in = 2.5 in    the instability increment @xmath118 is proportional to the absolute value of @xmath101 at very small values of @xmath119 : @xmath120 however , for each @xmath1 there exists a maximum value @xmath121 of the increment , which is attained at @xmath122 .",
    "therefore the approximate expressions ( [ blongscale ] ) and ( [ increment ] ) are valid only if @xmath123 . for large wave numbers , @xmath124 , the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are both positive .",
    "the asymptotic approximations in that region are : @xmath125 note that this expression does not contain the parameter @xmath78 . for a single vortex filament",
    "it is actually the exact expression for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which is valid in the whole range of @xmath101 .",
    "a general nonlinear analysis of the non - local system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is difficult",
    ". therefore we need some simplified model which would approximate the nonlinear dynamics , at least in the most interesting long scale unstable regime . in the next section ,",
    "we suggest such an approximate model and find a class of solutions describing the formation of a finite time singularity .",
    "we note that the same long - scale limit as ( [ alongscale]-[blongscale ] ) can be obtained from the local nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath126 where the coordinate @xmath127 is measured from the symmetry plane .",
    "this hamiltonian approximates the exact non - local hamiltonian of a symmetrical pair of vortex filaments in the case when the ratio of a typical value of @xmath128 to a typical longitudinal scale @xmath129 is much smaller than @xmath115 : @xmath130 in particular , this means that the slope of the curve with respect to the symmetry plane should be small , and also @xmath128 should be small in comparison with the radius of the line curvature .",
    "when @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , expression ( [ h_l ] ) gives the same result for uniform stationary motion as the exact hamiltonian .    with the cartesian parametrization ( [ cartesian ] ) , the corresponding approximate local nonlinear equations of motion have the form ( after appropriate time rescaling ) @xmath134 and they allow to obtain a simple explanation of the instability . on a qualitative level of understanding",
    ", the reason for the instability is that if initially some pieces of the curve were more close to the symmetry plane and convex in the direction of motion , then at subsequent moments in time the curvature will be increasing because of smaller values of @xmath128 and corresponding larger velocity , while @xmath128 will be decreasing due to the curvature .",
    "thus , the feedback is positive and the system is unstable . in the final stage of the instability development ,",
    "a locally self - similar regime in the dynamics is possible , because the above equations admit the self - similar substitution @xmath135 with arbitrary constants @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath5 , and with the exponent @xmath138 after substituting eqs.([xselfsimsubs]-[yselfsimsubs ] ) into eqs.([dotxz]-[dotyz ] ) , we obtain a pair of ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 : @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "however , with this choice of parametrization of the curve , the obviously existing symmetry of the system ( [ h_l ] ) with respect to rotation in the @xmath143-@xmath144 plane is hidden . for taking advantage of this symmetry ,",
    "cylindrical coordinates are more appropriate , with the angle coordinate @xmath145 serving as the longitudinal parameter : @xmath146 instead of the equations of motion ( [ dotxz]-[dotyz ] ) , we obtain the equivalent system ( where a same time rescaling as in ( [ dotxz]-[dotyz ] ) is performed ) @xmath147 here @xmath148 .",
    "this system follows from the lagrangian written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath149 the self - similar substitution @xmath150 does not change the meaning of the angle coordinate @xmath145 .",
    "it leads us to the following pair of equations for the functions @xmath151 and",
    "@xmath152 : @xmath153 we observe that there is no explicit dependence on @xmath145 in these equations .",
    "this property helps us to integrate the system .",
    "the general solution can be represented in the following parametric form ( see appendix b for a detailed derivation ) : @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 where the parameter @xmath157 runs between the limits @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "the constant @xmath159 determines the asymptotic slope of the curve at large distances from the origin : @xmath161 when @xmath162 , while the constant @xmath160 reflects the mentioned symmetry of the system with respect to rotations in @xmath143-@xmath144 plane . the condition ( [ local_condition ] ) for applicability of the local approximation ( [ h_l ] ) is satisfied if @xmath163 . a typical self - similar solution @xmath139",
    "is shown in fig.[xz ] .",
    "= 4.5 in = 2.0 in    it is interesting to note that the total angle @xmath164 between two asymptotic directions in @xmath143-@xmath144 plane does not depend on the parameter @xmath159 in the long - scale local approximation used above : @xmath165 at small values of @xmath1 , this angle approaches @xmath166 .",
    "another remark about @xmath164 is that the above expression assumes identical values at @xmath1 and at @xmath167 , so the value @xmath168 results in the extremum @xmath169 . for this case ,",
    "the curve lies on the cone @xmath170 .",
    "we observed that in the systems ( [ h_l ] ) with @xmath171 , finite time singularity formation is possible in the self - similar regime .",
    "inasmuch as the condition ( [ local_condition ] ) for applicability of the approximate hamiltonian ( [ h_l ] ) is satisfied in a range of the parameter @xmath159 related to the self - similar solutions ( [ varphi_p]-[r_p ] ) , we conclude that in the systems ( [ h_alpha ] ) self - similar collapse of two symmetrical singular vortex filaments can also take place .",
    "the principal question is whether this is also possible for filaments having finite width .",
    "if yes , then such solutions are analogous to the assumed self - similar solutions of the euler equation . though the exponent @xmath172 ( [ beta ] ) differs from @xmath173 , the difference is small if @xmath1 is small .",
    "however , an important difference exists between infinitely thin filaments and filaments with finite width : inside the latter , longitudinal flows take place , caused by a twist of the vortex lines constituting the filament .",
    "those flows keep the width homogeneous along the filament if a local stretching is not sufficiently fast .",
    "this mechanism acts against singularity formation and , probably , in some cases it can prevent a singularity at all .",
    "[ it is worth mentioning here that for finite width vortex structures in the navier - stokes equation frame , the usual `` outcome '' result of the crow instability is vortex line reconnection @xcite . ] thus , a more - less consistent analysis of the general situation should take into account , besides the dynamics of a mean shape of the filament , at least the dynamics of the width and the conjugated dynamics of the twist .",
    "clearly , we do not need to consider @xmath174 systems , when we deal with non - singular vortex filaments .",
    "it should be emphasized that an attempt to take account of finite width of the filament by simply using regularized green s functions such as @xmath175 with a constant @xmath176 , giving correct results for long scale limit of the linearized problem , fails to describe the dynamics in the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "also , we would like to note that a local approximation analogous to ( [ h_l ] ) is possible for arbitrary green s function @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding long scale hamiltonian has the form @xmath177 where the ( positive ) function @xmath178 is related to the function @xmath47 in the following way : @xmath179 the stationary motion with a constant coordinate @xmath180 is unstable if the second derivative of the function @xmath181 is negative at that value : @xmath182 .",
    "we believe that such systems can exhibit locally self - similar collapse , if the asymptotics of the function @xmath178 is power - like at small @xmath128 : @xmath183 , with @xmath171 .",
    "the final remark concerns the possibility of including effects caused by the fact that the unstable range is finite in the wave - number space into the approximate long scale theory .",
    "especially this is important for the case of small values of @xmath1 , because in that limit the condition ( [ local_condition ] ) for applicability of the hamiltonian ( [ h_l ] ) becomes too restrictive .",
    "the idea how to improve the approximation is the following . in general , the exact expression for the hamiltonian of a pair of singular filaments , after integration by parts , can be represented as the half of the integral over a surface @xmath184 drawn between the filaments ( one half since we consider only one from two symmetric strings ) : @xmath185 because the canonical momentum field @xmath186 created by filaments is determined by a multi - valued scalar potential @xmath187 : @xmath188 , which has the additive increment @xmath189 after passing around a filament .",
    "also the equality @xmath190 is important for derivation of the last expression . in the case of small @xmath1",
    ", we should just more carefully take account of the contribution to the surface integral from the vicinity of filaments . as the result of such consideration , we find that for a better approximation it is sufficient to replace in ( [ h_l ] ) the projection of the arc - length element by the entire arc - length element and , correspondingly , use the hamiltonian @xmath191 we stress once more here that this expression is valid only in the case @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "these investigations were supported by the graduate school in nonlinear science ( the danish research academy ) , and by the intas . the work of v.p.r . was supported by the rfbr ( grant no . 00 - 01 - 00929 ) and by the russian state program of support of the leading scientific schools ( grant no . 00 - 15 - 96007 ) .      in order to have some closed expressions for the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 instead of the integral representations ( [ ak ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) , let us use the following mathematical relations @xcite : @xmath194 @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 where @xmath98 is the gamma function , @xmath99 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the integral ( [ table_integral ] ) results in the equalities @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 thus , we have from ( [ ak ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) : @xmath201 @xmath202      in this appendix , we explain how the solution ( [ varphi_p]-[r_p ] ) of the system ( [ r_varphi]-[y_varphi ] ) can be obtained .",
    "let us introduce the designations @xmath203 then consider temporary @xmath204 as independent variable , and rewrite eq.([y_varphi ] ) as follows : @xmath205 or equivalently @xmath206 substituting into this equation the relation @xmath207 which follows from the equation ( [ r_varphi ] ) , we have the following equation for @xmath208 : @xmath209 this first order differential equation is linear for the inverse dependence @xmath210 , and its general solution is @xmath211 where @xmath159 is an arbitrary constant of integration .",
