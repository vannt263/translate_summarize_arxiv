    "branching bisimilarity was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is a behavioural equivalence on processes that is compatible with a notion of abstraction from internal activity , while at the same preserving the branching structure of processes in a strong sense .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , in particular to section 10 therein , for ample motivation of the relevance of branching bisimilarity .    branching bisimilarity abstracts to a large extent from _ divergence _",
    "( i.e. , infinite internal activity ) .",
    "for instance , it identifies a process , say @xmath0 , that may perform some internal activity after which it returns to its initial state ( i.e. , @xmath0 has a @xmath1-loop ) with a process , say @xmath2 , that admits the same behaviour as @xmath0 except that it can not perform the internal activity leading to the initial state ( i.e. , @xmath2 is @xmath0 without the @xmath1-loop ) .",
    "this means that branching bisimilarity is not compatible with any temporal logic featuring an _ eventually _ modality : for any desired state that @xmath2 will eventually reach , the mentioned internal activity of @xmath0 may be performed continuously , and thus prevent @xmath0 from reaching this desired state .",
    "the notion of _ branching bisimilarity with explicit divergence _ ( @xmath3 ) , also proposed in @xcite , is a suitable refinement of branching bisimilarity that is compatible with the well - known branching - time temporal logic ctl@xmath4 without the nexttime operator @xmath5 ( which is known to be incompatible with abstraction from internal activity ) .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we have proved that it is the coarsest semantic equivalence on labelled transition systems with silent moves that is a congruence for parallel composition ( as found in process algebras like ccs , csp or acp ) and only equates processes satisfying the same ctl@xmath6 formulas .",
    "it is also the finest equivalence in the _ linear time  branching time spectrum _ of @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to characterise a behavioural equivalence .",
    "the original definition of @xmath3 , in terms of _ coloured traces _",
    ", stems from @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath3 is defined in terms of a modal and a relational characterisation , which are claimed to coincide with each other and with the original notion from @xcite .",
    "of these three definitions of @xmath3 , the relational characterisation from @xcite is the most concise one , in the sense that it requires the least amount of auxiliary concepts .",
    "moreover , this definition is most in the style of the standard definitions of other kinds of bisimulation , found elsewhere in the literature . for these reasons ,",
    "it is tempting to take it as standard definition .",
    "although it is not hard to establish that the modal characterisation from @xcite is correct , in the sense that it defines an equivalence that coincides with @xmath3 of @xcite , it is not at all trivial to establish that the same holds for the relational characterisation from @xcite .",
    "if fact , it is non - trivial that this relation is an equivalence , and that it satisfies the so - called _ stuttering property_. once these properties have been established , it follows that the notion coincides with @xmath3 of @xcite .    in the remainder of this paper , we shall first , in section  [ sec : bb ] , briefly recapitulate the relational , coloured - trace , and modal characterisations of branching bisimilarity .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : relchar ] , we shall discuss the condition proposed in @xcite that can be added to the relational characterisation in order to make it divergence sensitive ; we shall then also discuss several variants on this condition . in section  [ sec : eqst ]",

    "finally , in section  [ sec : modchar ] , we shall establish agreement between the relational characterisation from @xcite , the modal characterisation from @xcite , and an alternative modal characterisation obtained by adding the divergence modality of @xcite to the hennessy - milner logic with _ until _ proposed in @xcite .",

    "furthermore , a conjunction of upward formulas is again an upward formula and a conjunction of downward formulas is again a downward formula .",
    "it follows , by the standard laws of boolean algebra , that the formula @xmath61 is equivalent to a formula of the desired shape .",
    "the proof that for every formula @xmath464 there exists an equivalent formula @xmath465 proceeds by induction on the structure of @xmath61 , and the only nontrivial case is when @xmath466 . according to the induction hypothesis , for @xmath467 and @xmath468 there exist equivalent formulas in @xmath378 , so , by lemma  [ lem : separation ] , @xmath467 is equivalent to a disjunction of conjunctions of upward and downward formulas .",
    "the proof in @xcite then relies on these disjunctions being finite . to generalise it to infinite disjunctions",

    "hence , by the evident congruence property of @xmath490 and lemma  [ lem : infdisjunctions ] , @xmath491 clearly , it now suffices to establish that @xmath492 is equivalent to a formula in @xmath378 , for all finite subsets @xmath493 of @xmath489 .",
    "recall that @xmath489 consists of conjunctions of an upward and a downward formula , so we can assume that @xmath494 ; we proceed by induction on the cardinality of @xmath493 .",

    "note that @xmath61 holds in the state @xmath22 of the transition system in figure  [ fig : divform ] ; each of the disjuncts @xmath515 holds in precisely one state .",
    "we conjecture that the formula of example  [ exa : disjunctiondivergence ] is not equivalent to a formula in [ 0pt][0pt]@xmath378 , and that , hence , replacing @xmath502 by @xmath503 in the modal logic for @xmath3 yields a strictly more expressive logic .",
    "we conclude the paper with a proof that the equivalence [ 0pt][0pt]@xmath516 induced on states by validity of formulas in [ 0pt][0pt]@xmath505 , defined by @xmath517 nevertheless also coincides with @xmath108 .      for the implication from left to right ,",
    "we prove by structural induction on @xmath61 that if @xmath107 and @xmath62 , then @xmath389 . we only treat the case @xmath519 , for the cases @xmath390 , @xmath520 and @xmath399 are already treated in the proof of theorem  [ theo : rmodchar ] .",
