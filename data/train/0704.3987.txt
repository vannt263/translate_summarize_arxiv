    "<S> we evaluate the partial widths for internal conversions in the higgs decays to two photons . for the higgs masses of interest at the lhc in the range of 100 - 150 gev , </S>",
    "<S> the conversions to pairs of fermions represent a significant fraction of higgs decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mechanism  @xcite has been introduced into the standard model  @xcite to explain electroweak symmetry breaking and the masses of the fundamental particles . in its simplest form </S>",
    "<S> the standard model requires a single neutral observable boson h. the search for the higgs boson has been one of the main motivations for the construction of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical properties of the standard model higgs boson have been extensively studied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its production mechanisms , coupling and most of the major decays have been well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the higgs boson remains the only free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit on the mass - @xmath0 114.4 gev at 95% cl - has been established in the direct searches done by the lep experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the global fits to the numerous data on electroweak processes show a strong preference for the low mass of the higgs . </S>",
    "<S> the current best fit value is @xmath1 186 gev at 95%cl  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> low mass higgs will decay predominantly to a pair of fermions or a pair of bosons . in the lhc experiments </S>",
    "<S> such decays will have to be disentangled from the copious background from qcd processes . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most promising channels for its observation at the lhc is the decay @xmath2 . in the low higgs mass range , </S>",
    "<S> this decay has a relatively small branching fraction but is also expected to have low background rate . </S>",
    "<S> it has been used as a benchmark in optimization of the atlas and cms detectors and in estimates of the discovery potential  @xcite .    , width=264 ]    in this note we point out that higgs decay into two photons may proceed via the internal conversion process analogous to the dalitz decay of a neutral pion  @xcite ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn]@xmath3 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the internal conversion refers to the decay of a virtual photon , @xmath4 , to a pair of fermions , where the virtual photon mass can range up to the mass of the higgs . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of a neutral pion , the choice of the fermion type is thus not limited to electrons only but will include all charged leptons and all quarks allowed by the kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> the running effective coupling of the virtual photon to the fermion pair has to be evaluated at the mass of the virtual photon , q  @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the mass of the fermion in the callan - symanzik beta function .    </S>",
    "<S> the easiest way to evaluate the rate for such internal conversions is to calculate the ratio of the higgs decay rate to a photon and a virtual photon and decay to a pair of real photons .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 where the @xmath9 refers to partial decay width .    in this ratio the terms due to the loop integration </S>",
    "<S> cancel out . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath10 is given by    @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the final state fermion mass . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding partial width for each channel is @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total width . </S>",
    "<S> the results for three values of the higgs mass are listed in table 1 and illustrated in fig.2 .    </S>",
    "<S> .values of the ratio @xmath10 and branching fractions for the higgs decays to two photons with single internal conversions . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : ht ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this calculation we take into account the color factors for the quarks , the charge dependence of the couplings and assume the lower limit of the mass integration to be equal to the lowest mass of a physical hadron produced in the decay , i.e. , pion mass for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks , kaon mass for the strange quark ; we use the particle data group values for the masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks  @xcite .     due to the dalitz decay correction . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line represents the branching fraction without the dalitz decay correction and the solid line takes into account the correction . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : brfr],width=377 ]    as can be seen , in the region of interest to the lhc the total dalitz decay rate of the neutral higgs is about 10% of the @xmath2 branching fraction . </S>",
    "<S> future lhc experiments should include the corresponding correction in their respective monte carlo programs .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the higgs dalitz decay to fermions results in the same final states as for the @xmath19 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the interference of the corresponding amplitudes have not been yet evaluated . </S>"
