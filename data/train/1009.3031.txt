    "jets have been observed around a large variety of astrophysical objects , such as young stellar objects ( ysos ) , accreting white dwarfs , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and are also thought to drive gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in ysos jets facilitate angular momentum transport , allowing the central star to accrete more matter , and likely play a similar role in accreting black hole systems , where in agn they are thought to also affect the evolution of their host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while there are enormous differences between the types and scales of objects around which jets can occur , the origins of jets seem to be remarkably similar , requiring the basic ingredients of infalling / collapsing , rotating matter , and magnetic fields .    despite these seemingly simple initial conditions , there are currently many outstanding problems in our understanding of jets , from their creation to their matter content and internal physics .",
    "one important facet of jets observationally is their hallmark synchrotron emission dominating the radio bands in particular , extending up to at least the near infrared ( nir ) in xrbs @xcite . at higher frequencies the typical power - law spectral energy distributions ( seds )",
    "are generally interpreted as optically thin synchrotron emission from accelerated particles , both in agn @xcite and in xrbs @xcite .",
    "an effective way to accelerate radiating particles into a power - law distribution is via diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) off scattering centers in turbulent plasma flows .",
    "once initiated , this process must to be distributed throughout the flow to account for the lack of spectral aging over vast distances along the jets .",
    "but where does the acceleration itself begin , and what triggers it ?",
    "there is increasing evidence that the start of this region is offset from the central compact object .",
    "for example in the jet of the agn m87 , recent vlbi observations show the synchrotron emission starting at a region offset by @xmath0 from the core @xcite .",
    "similarly , the start of power - law acceleration in compact jets would be indicated by a transition from optically thick emission , with a flat / inverted spectral index , to an optically thin power - law at a distinct location in the sed .",
    "such a break has been observed directly so far only in one source , the galactic xrb gx 339 - 4 , in the nir @xcite , during the `` hard '' or `` nonthermally dominated '' accretion state associated with compact jet formation ( see state definitions in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the stratification of emission regions in compact jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lower the frequency where this turnover occurs , the further the location along the jet where particle acceleration starts . in xrbs , a break in the nir corresponds to an offset of @xmath1 @xmath2 , and models of the broadband data of most black hole xrbs in the hard state so far seem to require such a break .",
    "the fact that the start of the acceleration region seems to occur at roughly the same location in several systems could be indicative of a critical point occurring in a magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) flow , particularly the magnetosonic modified fast point ( mfp ) . at the mfp the collimating magnetic field lines turn inwards towards the jet axis , potentially leading to recollimation shocks , while at the same time the flow becomes causally disconnected so shocks can occur without disrupting the flow upstream .",
    "such a shock region thus would occur at a fixed location in the flow , closely connected to the mfp , and would be an ideal location for particle acceleration to begin .",
    "we wish to investigate the feasiblity of this premiss in this paper .",
    "because of the complexity involved in relativistic mhd including strong gravity , many groups are using the results of simulations to study the formation and development of jets .",
    "these simulations often show the development of a steady outflow in which the magnetic field is remarkably self - similar and axisymmetric near the launch point ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 and fig",
    ". 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "however to study specifically the development of critical points in the flow and their dependence on external boundary conditions , current mhd simulations either do not extend far enough from the black hole , or if they do , they are too computationally expensive .",
    "assuming that the resulting flows retain a self - similar structure , at least when gravity does not dominate as indicated in the simulations , we adopt the formalism developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vk03 ) . by assuming axisymmetry and a self - similar field line geometry , vk03 reduce the exact equations of special relativistic mhd to a one - dimensional problem .",
    "although vk03 focused on jets in grbs , this treatment is also applicable to other mhd jets such as in agn and microquasars .    in an earlier self - similar treatment that was non - relativistic",
    ", @xcite presented a solution where the flow crosses the mfp at a finite height above the disk . in vk03 , however , they only found relativistic solutions with an mfp occurring at infinity ( meaning that the flow asymptotically approaches a perfect cylindrical geometry ) . in this paper",
    "we extend the study of vk03 and derive new solutions in which the relativistic flow crosses the mfp at a finite location above the disk . in   2 we describe the vk03 model and our method for exploring the full parameter space of solutions . in ",
    "3 we present the first relativistic solutions that pass through an mfp . in   4",
    "we discuss our results , and the dependence of the mfp location on the model parameters .",
    "we also describe how this work sets the stage for further development to connect the flow to regions near the disk where gravity can no longer be ignored . ",
    "5 contains our conclusions .",
    "during the acceleration and collimation of jets , magnetic fields are thought to efficiently extract rotational energy from either the compact object @xcite or the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the latter models are in the newtonian limit , with the matter considered cold , meaning there is negligible thermal pressure causing bulk acceleration to non - relativistic velocities .",
    "these cold , non - relativistic solutions were generalized to the relativistic regime by @xcite , allowing the bulk velocity to attain relativistic speeds . vk03",
    "further extended the solutions to include the `` hot '' regime , allowing the random motions of the particles to become relativistic and thus the jets to be hydrodynamically accelerated even at the base where temperatures are high .",
    "it is this last scenario that we base this work upon .",
    "starting from the equations of time - dependent special relativistic mhd , we make the following assumptions to render them more tractable : ideal mhd , no gravitational field or external force ( and thus self - similarity holds ) , axisymmetry , a zero azimuthal electric field and time independence . following the terminology of vk03 , after scaling the equations to make them non - dimensional , we are left with two coupled differential equations ( equations and in the appendix ) .",
    "combining these two coupled differential equations , we obtain a single equation for @xmath3 ( equation , with @xmath4 the alfvnic mach number and @xmath5 the angle of the point on the field line with the axis of symmetry ) which acts like a `` wind equation '' , much akin to the wind equation of the parker solar wind model @xcite .",
    "this wind equation , along with the other algebraic equations ( see appendix ) , can be solved for the velocity , magnetic and electric field strength , density and pressure along a field line . due to the self - similar assumption ,",
    "once solutions are obtained for one field line , all other field lines can be obtained by simple scaling .",
    "an example of this self - similarity and the meaning of some of the parameters used can be found in figure [ geometry ] .    instead of the single critical ( or sonic ) point of the parker solar wind model , due to the inclusion of magnetic fields , the obtained wind equation has three locations where the denominator crosses zero .",
    "starting from the accretion disk , these are the modified slow point ( msp ) , the alfvn point , and the mfp .",
    "the msp and mfp are also called the slow and fast magnetosonic separatrix surfaces .",
    "the alfvn point is the location where the relativistic collimation speed of the flow towards the axis ( @xmath6 ) is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor , @xmath9 the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath10 the cylindrical radius in units of the light cylinder radius , @xmath11 the baryon rest - mass density , and @xmath12 the specific relativistic enthalpy ( the variables are described in more detail in  [ variables ] ) .",
    "the denominator of @xmath3 with the alfvn point divided out , can be expressed as @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{u_\\mathrm{s}^2}{c^2 } \\frac{b_\\theta^2 ( 1 - x^2)}{4 \\pi \\rho_0 \\xi c^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 @xmath15 the velocity of light , @xmath16 the strength of the electric field , and @xmath17 the polytropic index .",
    "the msp and mfp are , by definition , the locations where @xmath18 ( vk03 ) .    at every critical point",
    ", the numerator of @xmath3 should also pass through zero to ensure a smooth crossing .",
    "this translates into a regularity condition at the critical points and fixes the value of a free parameter .",
    "even though the msp should be crossed smoothly to obtain a solution that describes the entire jet from the accretion disk to the termination point , gravitational effects can not be ignored at the msp . since the equations do not include gravity ( as it is not compatible with the self - similarity assumption in relativistic flow ) , we do not try to fit for the msp .",
    "therefore we fit two critical points , and correspondingly two parameters are fixed , in our approach described below @xmath19 for the alfvn point and @xmath20 for the mfp .",
    "the physical importance of the mfp is that it is the location where not even the fastest signals can travel upstream anymore , meaning anything downstream from the mfp is causally disconnected from the region upstream .",
    "if , for example , a shock were to exist beyond the mfp , it could not disrupt the flow leading to that shock , allowing it to be a permanent feature .",
    "as mentioned above , at the mfp there is a component of the velocity heading towards the axis .",
    "this can lead to a collimation shock shortly beyond the mfp , causing the magnetic energy to be converted to particle energy and the jet to become kinetically dominated .",
    "another possibility is that the flow remains magnetically dominated , and , after reaching a minimum radius , bounces back , retaining an ordered magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is not in conflict with the statement in vk03 that the only physically acceptable case in the super - alfvnic regime is for the flow to become asymptotically cylindrical , as this statement only applies to solutions with @xmath21 .",
    "the prescription we are following from vk03 has 9 free parameters that determine the solution , whose effects are described below . following the same notation , a roman subscript a signifies the value of a variable at the alfvn point and an italic _ a _ denotes a value with respect to the poloidal magnetic flux function .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 determines the current distribution .",
    "a value @xmath21 corresponds to the current - carrying regime , with higher values of f ensuring faster collimation , but if @xmath23 we are in the return - current regime .",
    "the restriction on @xmath22 is that it can not be negative : .",
    "although we consider @xmath22 to be a free parameters , for this paper we chose to keep it fixed at 0.75 .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath17 can have values of @xmath24 for relativistic and @xmath25 for non - relativistic solutions .",
    "@xmath26 gives the angle where the alfvn point is located with respect to the axis of symmetry .",
    "it is limited by the value of @xmath27 : .",
    "@xmath27 gives the poloidal slope of the field line at the alfvn point with respect to the accretion disk .",
    "this in turn is limited by @xmath26 : .",
    "@xmath28 is the radius squared of the alfvn point in terms of the light cylinder radius . for @xmath29",
    "the solution becomes more force - free .",
    "the allowed values are .",
    "@xmath20 is the magnetization parameter in the monopole solution of @xcite and is related to the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio .",
    "the constraint is .",
    "@xmath30 is the dimensionless adiabatic coefficient and is constant along a field line . for a large value of @xmath30 ,",
    "the specific relativistic enthalpy of the matter is high , for @xmath31 equation shows @xmath32 and the flow is cold . therefore .",
    "@xmath19 is the derivative of @xmath33 with respect to the polar angle @xmath5 at the alfvn point . accelerating flow implies .",
    "@xmath34 , with reference magnetic field @xmath35 and reference length @xmath36 , is the scaling of the solution , relating the dimensionless values to physical dimensions .",
    "we do not yet apply our solutions to specific black hole systems , so this parameter is not used here but it will be important for future applications of our solutions .",
    "the smooth crossing of the alfvn point is ensured by calculating @xmath19 from the corresponding regularity condition , given by equation . in the same way we determine @xmath20 by crossing the mfp , although this parameter sometimes can have two values ( see figure [ 3d ] ) .",
    "this leaves @xmath22 , @xmath17 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 ( and @xmath34 ) to satisfy the boundary conditions at the source and , indirectly , at the end of the jet .",
    "there are also parameters derived from the above values :    @xmath37 determines the total energy - to - mass - flux ratio ( @xmath38 ) and is conserved along a field line .",
    "this parameter is determined from equation and .",
    "@xmath39 is the value of the magnetization function @xmath40 , defined as the poynting - to - matter energy flux , at the alfvn point .",
    "this parameter is determined from equation . as @xmath37 can not be negative , from equation",
    "follows .",
    "and finally we describe the other variables used in the equations :    @xmath41 determines the specific ( per baryon mass ) relativistic enthalpy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "if @xmath42 we have cold , pressureless matter .",
    "@xmath41 will drop from the high temperatures at the base of the jet as matter is mainly accelerated hydrodynamically and at some point above the disk drop down to 1 . from this point on",
    "all acceleration is magnetic .",
    "this variable is determined from equation .",
    "@xmath4 is the alfvnic mach number , the velocity of the flow in terms of the alfvn velocity .",
    "@xmath43 is the radius in terms of @xmath44 and is therefore equal to 1 at the alfvn point .      to find solutions with an mfp we obtained expressions for @xmath45 , given by equation , and for @xmath46 by combining the derivative of the bernoulli equation with the transfield equation using the determinant method . because @xmath46 is very unstable near the alfvn point , as the numerator has a first order zero point there and the denominator a second order one , we reverted to the bernoulli equation , given by , to determine @xmath47 . to start off the integration from the alfvn point",
    "we specify @xmath22 , @xmath17 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 and an initial guess for @xmath20 .",
    "we determine @xmath19 from the alfvn regularity condition , equation . integrating outward from the alfvn point , we determine whether the numerator or denominator crosses zero first and adjust @xmath20 accordingly until both cross at the same time .",
    "we then proceed to explore the range of solutions which cross both the alfvn point and mfp ( see figure [ solutionc ] ) . for plotting purposes ,",
    "we have divided out the factor @xmath48 in both the numerator and denominator .    as discussed above ,",
    "because there is no gravity in the model , we do not try explicitly to cross the modified slow point ( msp ) .",
    "gravitational effects should play a large role close to the black hole , and the self - similar equations can not predict accurately where the msp is located .      to begin our exploration of parameter space , we chose a solution from @xcite known to have an mfp ( specified below their figure 4 ) with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . by comparing terms in @xcite and vk03 , it is possible to translate these parameters to the parameters used in vk03 . because we are using the relativistic equations from vk03 , the parameters of our first solution ( see table [ parametertable ] ) differ slightly from the corresponding parameters above and we vary @xmath20 to obtain a critical solution again . from this solution",
    "we were able to traverse parameter space , while allowing only critical solutions with an mfp . by increasing @xmath28",
    "we were able to obtain higher velocities of the jet . after achieving relativistic velocities , we focused on finding solutions with higher values of @xmath30 , as the solutions so far were cold .",
    "but for a fixed value of @xmath28 there is a maximum value of @xmath30 that produces critical solutions crossing the mfp .",
    "this is due to the fact that the collection of all solutions form a surface in the multidimensional parameter space , and we had reached a maximum for @xmath30 for the fixed values of the other parameters ( see figure [ 3d ] ) .",
    "the surfaces of valid solutions have roughly the same appearance for the explored range of @xmath26 and @xmath28 . to describe the effect of @xmath26 and @xmath28 on the solutions , we approximate the graph as a cone with the base in the @xmath58-plane and with the maximally allowed value of @xmath30 as its height",
    ". if we increase @xmath44 the base of the cone shrinks while moving to higher @xmath20 , and the height decreases . the latter limits the maximum value that @xmath28",
    "can be increased to .",
    "if we decrease @xmath26 , the height increases , indirectly allowing higher values for @xmath28 . the area of the base becomes bigger and shifts to higher @xmath27 and @xmath20 , with the upper surface becoming steeper .",
    "due to the shape of the surface , it is possible to increase any two parameters of @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath20 at the expense of the third .    by extending our search to three parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath30 and @xmath20 ) , we were able to move around this point and continue increasing @xmath30 .",
    "this revealed a multidimensional surface that is double - valued in @xmath20 .",
    "an example of this surface is shown in figure [ 3d ] , which also includes our most relativistic solution presented below , solution @xmath15 .",
    "the numerator , denominator , and acceleration of @xmath33 in this latter solution are also plotted in figure [ solutionc ] .",
    "in this section we present the various solutions crossing the mfp , from the first one that we found to one with relativistic temperature and bulk flow we sought , while describing the features particular to a certain solution .",
    "the parameters of our solutions are given in table [ parametertable ] and the main properties in figure [ overview ] .",
    "as we are not yet applying our solutions to specific black hole systems , we do not use the scaling parameters @xmath34 and @xmath36 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    note.the values for the first six parameters ( @xmath22 through @xmath27 ) are exact , for the last four ( @xmath20 through @xmath37 ) they are rounded off . [ parametertable ]      this solution is the closest to the non - relativistic parameter values given in @xcite that conforms to the alfvn regularity condition ( arc ) , which is the transfield equation at the alfvn point .",
    "the solution crosses the mfp at @xmath60 or @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the alfvn point is located at @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "the top left panel of figure [ overview ] gives the meridional projection of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the jet overcollimates after a maximum radius of almost 16 times the alfvn radius at @xmath65 or @xmath66 , shortly before the mfp .",
    "the second left panel of figure [ overview ] shows the flow is cold throughout ( @xmath67 ) due to the very small value for @xmath30 and low @xmath28 .",
    "as @xmath68 at the alfvn point , equation gives a value for @xmath69 very close to 1 .",
    "the energy of the matter @xmath41 ( including the dominant rest mass energy ) is much higher than the energy in the magnetic field throughout .",
    "therefore , even though the magnetic acceleration is efficient , the jet is not accelerated to relativistic velocities ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the third center panel shows the `` causal connection '' opening angle @xmath71 and the opening half - angle of the outflow , which goes from @xmath64 to a few degrees overcollimation .",
    "although the causal connection opening angle has little importance for non - relativistic flows , as it remains very close to @xmath72 since @xmath73 , it is shown for completeness .",
    "after our first solution , we increased the velocity of our jet by increasing @xmath28 .",
    "as the top center panel in figure [ overview ] shows , after a long period where the field line remains almost parabolic , the jet in this solution overcollimates as well .",
    "this is caused by magnetic hoop stresses and may allow a shock region to develop beyond the mfp . the alfvn point is again located at @xmath63 and the mfp at @xmath75 or @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) . the second center panel shows the lorentz factor and the enthalpy of the flow .",
    "the flow here also is seen to be cold ( @xmath78 ) , meaning the jet is mainly magnetically accelerated , which is again due to the small value of @xmath30",
    ". the poynting - to - mass flux ratio ( @xmath79 ) decreases , showing magnetic energy being transferred into kinetic energy , with the flow reaching a lorentz factor of 2.8 .",
    "the bottom center panel shows the squares of the light cylinder radius , @xmath80 , and the alfvnic mach number , @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath81 the light surface is reached , which is the radius where the field circular velocity reaches the speed of light .      after having achieved a relativistic solution for the cold plasma case , we would like to find solutions with an increased flow temperature . to do",
    "so requires increasing the value of @xmath41 .",
    "as @xmath33 is given by @xmath82 at the alfvn point , equation shows that increasing @xmath28 and/or @xmath30 has the desired effect .",
    "unfortunately , for larger @xmath28 the maximum value of @xmath30 decreases . by choosing a lower value for @xmath26 the attainable values for @xmath28 and @xmath30",
    "are increased , leading to a warmer flow .",
    "this solution is shown in the third column of figure [ overview ] .",
    "the alfvn point is located at @xmath83 or @xmath84 and the mfp at @xmath85 or @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "near the beginning of the flow @xmath88 .    the lorentz factor of the flow at the mfp is 8.3 , which is mainly due to the high initial poynting flux .",
    "it can be seen in the second right panel of figure [ overview ] that @xmath41 always drops to 1 and from the fourth right panel that @xmath33 always dominates @xmath89 near the mfp . as the lorentz factor is given by @xmath90",
    "the final lorentz factor is approximately @xmath37 .",
    "this means that while the jets may start as poynting flux - dominated , eventually they convert most of their poynting flux and become kinetic energy - dominated .",
    "since we are interested in the location of the mfp , we would like to know how it depends on the model parameters . as it is challenging to sample the full parameter space , we will focus on the region around the solution closest to observed jets , solution @xmath15 . by allowing all parameters to vary and looking at the effect this has on the location where the mfp occurs , we can draw the following conclusions : the mfp moves outward ( smaller @xmath5 ) when the alfvn point occurs at a smaller angle , ( lower @xmath26 ) , when the temperature at the base of the flow is increased ( higher @xmath30 ) , when the flow at the alfvn point is already close to collimation ( higher @xmath27 ) , or when the alfvn point moves closer to the light cylinder radius , making the flow more force - free ( higher @xmath44 ) .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining new , solutions for a relativistic , magnetized flow that smoothly crosses the mfp at a finite height ( @xmath91 ) above the system equator .",
    "these solutions suggest that it should be possible to construct better , more mhd - consistent jet models where the location of the acceleration region is determined _ a priori _ from the physical boundary conditions .",
    "so far none of the solutions derived remains poynting flux - dominated up to the mfp , which is probably due to the relatively small value of @xmath20 found so far .",
    "increasing @xmath28 and especially decreasing @xmath26 will allow higher values of @xmath20 to be used .",
    "the same can also be done at the expense of @xmath30 .",
    "we also have described some of the relations between the different parameters ( see  [ variables ] ) and the effect they have on each other .",
    "having a more force - free solution ( higher @xmath28 ) decreases the allowed range of temperatures ( @xmath30 ) and collimation at the alfven point ( @xmath27 ) , but at the same time allows a higher value of @xmath20 that provides a critical solution . keeping all other parameters fixed , there is a maximum value of @xmath28 for which a solution is possible at all .",
    "this maximum may be increased by moving the alfvn point closer to the disk ( smaller @xmath26 ) .",
    "this change has the additional effects of allowing a broader range for the collimation angle at the alfvn point ( @xmath27 ) while at the same time shifting this range towards higher collimation .",
    "it also allows for a higher temperature of the flow ( @xmath30 ) or a higher magnetic field strengths ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "any pair of parameters @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath20 may be increased at the expense of the third .",
    "two parameters not varied so far are @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "higher values for @xmath22 should ensure faster collimation and might therefore be very important for the exact location of the mfp .",
    "similarly , we may want to explore the @xmath92 case for jets with extremely relativistic temperature .",
    "however , for the weaker jets in agn and xrbs that we plan to target , the radiating particle distributions are generally thought to peak at mildly relativistic energies .",
    "if the start of the particle acceleration region in steady jets is indeed associated with the magnetosonic fast critical point in the bulk flow , then our results support the conclusion that such a region could occur at a fairly stable location about the launch point .",
    "all of the solutions found overcollimate shortly before the mfp , as would be expected for the initiation of shock development . by starting with a solution that crosses the mfp in the non - relativistic case of @xcite",
    ", we were able to extend the solution through the multidimensional parameter space towards relativistic velocities and temperatures , while retaining the critical point .",
    "this feature sets our results apart from the work of vk03 , whose formulism we adopted , in that they are immediately applicable to observed compact jet sources with an optically thick - to - thin break in the synchrotron spectrum , such as hard state xrbs and weakly accreting agn .",
    "our most promising solution is a jet outflow with mildly relativistic temperature , and lorentz factor of @xmath93 , also appropriate for the steady jets in both xrbs as well as agn .",
    "it is clear that a wide range of parameter space is left still unexplored , that can be exploited for matching physical boundary conditions appropriate to known astrophysical sources .",
    "however , before a radiative model can be constructed around the dynamical `` backbone '' provided by the solutions presented here , a prescription for including gravity must be included , to extend these solutions through the msp and allow connection with a physical model of the accretion flow / corona .",
    "we are currently working on matching these necessarily non - self similar solutions to those presented here , which will be presented in a separate work .",
    "once this solution is in place , we will have a much more physically consistent model ( compared to , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to use in the fitting of data from accreting black holes across the mass scale , which show compact , steady jets . as there seems to be no shortage of possible solutions , we are confident that we can match physical boundary conditions with critical solutions .",
