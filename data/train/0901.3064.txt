    "given a compact and oriented surface @xmath5 , one define its representation space as the quotient @xmath6 . for @xmath7 , we obtain three related and celebrated spaces .",
    "the first one is an algebraic variety which classifies semi - stable complex bundles of rank 2 over @xmath5 with trivial determinant : it contains the two other ones .",
    "the second space is compact and contains an open and dense subset supporting a natural symplectic form .",
    "its quantization provides a construction of a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) which has interesting interactions with the topology of 3-manifolds .",
    "finally the last space contains as a connected component the teichmller space , that is , the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study a special class of functions on these spaces called `` trace functions '' . given a 1-dimensional submanifold @xmath8 of @xmath5 and a representation @xmath9 one set @xmath10)=\\prod_i(-{\\operatorname{tr}}(\\rho(t_i)))\\ ] ] where the @xmath11 s represent the free homotopy classes of the components of @xmath8 .",
    "assume that the euler characteristic of @xmath0 is negative .",
    "we prove that the functions @xmath12 where @xmath8 runs over the isotopy classes of 1-submanifolds of @xmath5 without component bounding a disc are linearly independent as functions on @xmath6 for @xmath13 or @xmath14 . in the case",
    "@xmath15 , it follows that these functions form a basis of the coordinate ring of the representation variety .",
    "consequently the coordinate ring is isomorphic to the skein algebra of @xmath16 $ ] at @xmath17 , cf .",
    "sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : kauffman - module ] for precise statements .",
    "d. bullock showed in @xcite that the last assertion is equivalent to proving that the skein algebra has no zero divisors .",
    "bullock s proof rely on a delicate analysis of algebraic relations between trace functions which started in @xcite .",
    "our strategy is completely different and somewhat simpler : using a pants decomposition of the surface , we define on @xmath1 an action of the torus @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the set of separating curves of the decomposition .",
    "moreover , 1-dimensional submanifolds of @xmath5 are parametrized up to isotopy by their dehn coordinates , which is a system of parameters depending on the pants decomposition .",
    "finally , we compute the fourier decomposition of the trace functions relatively to the action of @xmath18 and show that one can recover the geometric intersection number of two curves and more generally the full dehn parameters of a multicurve via its fourier decomposition .",
    "this allows us to prove our assertion .",
    "our motivation to study the trace functions is the quantization of the representation space @xmath20 .",
    "first , the space of trace functions is a poisson algebra , the poisson bracket being defined with the symplectic structure of atiyah - bott @xcite .",
    "hence the skein algebra at @xmath4 inherits a poisson bracket .",
    "it appears that the skein algebra at @xmath21 is a deformation quantization of this poisson algebra .",
    "this is a consequence of the goldman formula @xcite expressing the bracket of trace function , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "not only do we have a formal quantization , but also a strict quantization provided by the topological quantum field theory .",
    "working with the combinatorial version of tqft @xcite we associate to @xmath0 a family of hilbert spaces @xmath22 and to each curve @xmath23 a family of operators @xmath24 .",
    "then it appears that the natural symbol of this family of operators is the trace function of @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , by @xcite the asymptotic behavior of @xmath25 as the level @xmath26 tends to infinity is controlled at first order by the trace function .",
    "furthermore the composition and the commutator of operators corresponds to the product and poisson bracket of the trace functions .",
    "so the relation between the curve operators and the trace functions is similar to the one in microlocal analysis between operators and their symbol . in this point of view",
    ", the interest of our result is to produce non - vanishing trace functions and consequently non - vanishing curve operators .",
    "this has non - trivial consequences like the asymptotic faithfulness of the representation of the mapping class group on @xmath27 provided by tqft , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in the next parts of this introduction",
    ", we give precise statement of our results ( sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : kauffman - module ] ) and on the quantization of @xmath28 ( sections [ sec : poisson ] and [ sec : tqft ] ) .",
    "note that we do not use skein modules and tqft in the sequel of the paper .",
