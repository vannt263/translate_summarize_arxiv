    "several kinds of independences have been discovered since free independence was introduced by d. voiculescu @xcite .",
    "after such discoveries , there were attempts to define and classify independence .",
    "an exchangeability system introduced by f. lehner @xcite is a very general definition of independence .",
    "other important classes are universal independence and natural independence ; the former one was studied by m. schrmann , r. speicher and a. ben ghorbal and the latter was by n. muraki @xcite .",
    "there are also many attempts to interpolate different independences .",
    "the conditionally ( c- for short hereafter ) free independence , initiated by m. boejko , m. leinert and r. speicher @xcite , is an important one in that it includes six independences : free @xcite , boolean @xcite , monotone @xcite , anti - monotone @xcite , c - monotone @xcite and c - anti - monotone independences .",
    "while the explicit definition of the last one may not be found in the literature , it can be defined by reversing the order structure of c - monotone independence .",
    "c - free independence and the other six can be formulated as products of states in the free product of algebras with or without identification of units .",
    "important properties of the above mentioned products of states are associative laws .",
    "for instance , associativity was crucial in the classification of universal independence , quasi - universal independence and natural independence @xcite .",
    "the associative laws of the c - free , free , boolean products are not difficult to prove on the basis of their definitions . however , the associative laws of monotone and c - monotone products ( and moreover anti - monotone and c - anti - monotone products ) are not trivial .",
    "u. franz proved the associative law of the monotone product in @xcite and the author proved the associative law of the c - monotone product in @xcite .",
    "associativity is also a central topic of this paper .",
    "we define the c - free product of states @xcite .",
    "[ eq1 ] let @xmath0 be an index set and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) be algebraic probability spaces equipped with two states .",
    "@xmath3 are assumed to be unital .",
    "the c - free product of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath4 , is defined by the following rules .",
    "@xmath5 is defined to be the free product with identification of units and @xmath6 the free product of states .",
    "@xmath7 is defined by the following property .",
    "if @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , then @xmath12 the notation @xmath9 means that the neighboring elements are different .",
    "we often write only states in such a form as @xmath13 and omit algebras when there is no confusion . as is understood by definition , the right component acts on the left .",

    "let @xmath22 be @xmath15-algebras for @xmath20 and @xmath3 be their unitizations defined by @xmath23 .",
    "then we can define delta states @xmath24 on @xmath3 by @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 . from now on we always assume these unitizations when we use delta states . in this setting",
    ", the boolean product @xmath16 appears as @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , u. franz proved in @xcite that the monotone product ( resp .",
    "anti - monotone product ) appears as @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) .",
    "the connection to the monotone product yields nontrivial problems : the associative law of monotone product does not follow from that of the c - free product , nor do the monotone cumulants from the c - free cumulants",
    ". the same problem also arises about the anti - monotone product .",
    "motivated by these , the author defined a c - monotone product in @xcite .",
    "the c - monotone product @xmath17 of pairs of states is defined by @xmath31 the left component @xmath32 is also denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the c - monotone product is associative , but this is not a consequence of the associativity of the c - free product .",
    "the c - monotone product can be seen as a generalization of monotone and boolean products : @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ". moreover , the associative laws of monotone and boolean products are consequences of that of the c - monotone product .",
    "a c - anti - monotone product is similarly defined by @xmath36 and the left component @xmath37 is denoted as @xmath38 .    in this paper",
    "we construct an associative product of triples of states which generalizes free , c - free , monotone , anti - monotone , boolean , c - monotone , c - anti - monotone products .",
    "this is defined by @xmath39 which will be called an _ indented product_. in particular , the product @xmath40 is associative .",
    "this will be called an _ ordered free _ ( or o - free for simplicity ) _ product _ and denoted by the same symbol @xmath41 .",
    "while these products are defined by a combinations of c - free products , the associative laws do not follow from that of the c - free product .",
    "these situations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ dia21 ] .",
    "furthermore , o - free and indented products are naturally expected to have connections with the concept of _ matricial freeness _ introduced by r. lenczewski recently @xcite .",
    "we however leave this direction to a future research .",
    "we note that the products @xmath42 and @xmath43 are also associative .",
    "the structures of these products are equal to the indented product and the ordered free product respectively .",
    "we therefore do not mention these two anymore .",
    "we explain the contents of this paper . in section [ prob ] , we characterize the additive and multiplicative convolutions in terms of reciprocal of cauchy transforms .",
    "the reader may wonder how the products ( [ eq0001 ] ) and ( [ eq0002 ] ) were found to be associative ; therefore we explain the motivation for the definition of ( [ eq0002 ] ) as an application of the characterizations .",
    "once this is explained , the definition ( [ eq0001 ] ) will be understood as a natural extension of ( [ eq0002 ] ) . in section",
    "[ prod ] the associative laws of the indented product and o - free product will be proved . in section [ rep ]",
    "we construct a representation of the free product of unital algebras which enables us to calculate the indented and o - free products in terms of operators on a hilbert space .",
    "motivation for this section comes from the works by d. avitzour @xcite , d. voiculescu @xcite , m. boejko and r. speicher @xcite and m. popa @xcite .",
    "the remaining contents are mainly devoted to cumulants . in free probability theory ,",
    "there have been many researches on combinatorial aspects of cumulants since r. speicher introduced non - crossing partitions in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "a crucial partition structure is `` linearly ordered non - crossing partitions '' first introduced by n. muraki @xcite . in section [ cum ] , we define cumulants for indented independence . this independence is noncommutative , that is , if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are independent , @xmath45 and @xmath44 are not necessarily independent ; therefore , the corresponding cumulants should be defined along the line of @xcite . since the associative laws of the seven kinds of products follow from that of the indented product , moment - cumulant formulae for them also follow from indented independence . in particular , we obtain moment - cumulant formula for c - monotone independence .",
    "we then derive differential equations as relations between generating functions of moments and cumulants for single variable . in section [ lim ]",
    "we prove the central limit theorem w.r.t .",
    "indented independence .",
    "the limit measures are kesten distributions ; this result unifies the limit distributions in the c - free and c - monotone cases .",

    "@xmath87 in view of the notation of the c - free product of states , it is natural to denote by @xmath88 the c - free convolution of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    now we explain the motivation for this paper .",
