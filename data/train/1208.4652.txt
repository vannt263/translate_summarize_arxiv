    "the rms amplitude of the quantum mechanical expectation value is suppressed by the extra factor @xmath159 . as mentioned in the main article , this suppression is the consequence of the fact that the noise of the quantum - mechanical expectation value is , in a sense , averaged over the quantum superposition of @xmath1 independent `` noises '' associated with the time evolution of each of the basis states in the schroedinger representation .    despite the exponentially large difference in the amplitudes , the monitored noise and the noise of @xmath155 should have identical normalized time correlation functions in _ macroscopic _ systems . if the total magnetization is the only variable being continuously monitored in the system ( or one of a small number of variables ) , then the disturbance of the dynamics of an individual spin in the bulk of the sample should be minimal .",
