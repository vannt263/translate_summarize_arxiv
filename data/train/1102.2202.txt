    "in a good number of problems one needs to consider a physical model on the background of some manifold with compactified spatial dimensions . many high - energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in a higher dimensional spacetime and it is commonly assumed that the extra dimensions are compactified . in particular , additional compact dimensions have been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories . from the inflationary point of view , universes with compact dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception lind04 .",
    "models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation .",
    "there has been a large activity to search for signatures of non - trivial topology by identifying ghost images of galaxies , clusters or quasars .",

    "the boundary conditions imposed on fields along compact dimensions give rise to a modification of the spectrum of the vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see @xcite and references therein ) . in models of kaluza - klein type",

    "when the quantum field lives in all regions of space , the pure topological parts of the force acting from the left- and from the right - hand sides of every plate compensate each other , and the resulting force is just determined by the interaction part .",
    "this turns out to be always attractive , with independence of the periodicity conditions along the compact dimensions and the value of the gauge potential . in more physical situations , however , when the quantum field is confined in the region between the plates , the pure topological part contributes to the resulting force as well and in these cases the final forces can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "remarkably , the casimir effect can then be used as a stabilization mechanism for both the interplate distance and for the size of the compact subspace in kaluza - klein - type models and in braneworld theories .    for massless fermionic fields ,",
    "the casimir densities for the two - plate geometry in conformally - flat spacetimes with compact spatial dimensions are obtained from the results above simply by using standard conformal transformation techniques .",
    "the corresponding fermionic condensate and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor are thus given by eq .",
    "( [ fctilcf ] ) , where the separate contributions : the one induced by non - trivial topology and the other by the boundary conditions , are given by the second terms on the right - hand sides .",
    "the most important examples of configurations of this type are ds and ads spacetimes .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : nano ] , we have applied our general results to the electrons in finite - length graphene nanotubes .",
    "the long - wavelength excitations of this system is basically described by dirac s theory , with the fermi velocity playing the role of speed of light .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the fermionic condensate and for the casimir densities are obtained from the results of the preceding sections by summing the contributions of the two triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice of the graphene sheet , with opposite signs of the phases along the compact dimension . in the presence of a magnetic flux ,",
    "the fermion condensate is given by eqs .",
    "( [ fccn ] ) and ( [ fccnm0 ] ) , for massive and for massless fields , respectively . the pure topological contribution is then given by ( [ fc0cn ] ) .",
    "in these formulas , the values @xmath195 and @xmath196 correspond to metallic and to semiconducting nanotubes , respectively .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the vev of the energy - momentum tensor have the form ( [ emtcn ] ) and ( [ emtcnm0 ] ) .",
    "the vevs are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with period equal to the flux quantum . in the absence of magnetic flux , the casimir forces acting on the edges of the nanotube are always attractive for metallic nanotubes . however ,",
    "for semiconductor nanotubes the forces are attractive for short tubes and repulsive for longer ones . in the presence of the magnetic flux",
    ", the sign of the force for long tubes can be controlled by tuning the flux .",
    "this possibility opens the way to the design of efficient actuators driven by the casimir force at the nanoscale , what is a most cherished goal of present day technology .",
