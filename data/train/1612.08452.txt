    "at low temperatures amorphous solids show anomalous behaviour with respect to their ordered counterparts .",
    "as was first noted by zeller and pohl the equilibrium properties of amorphous solids have different temperature dependance than predicted by the debye model ; some examples are the temperature dependences of the heat capacity @xmath3 , and the thermal conductivity @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , phonon attenuation is qualitatively and quantitatively universal in a large variety of disordered and amorphous materials . shortly after , anderson _ et al . _ and",
    "phillips @xcite independently developed the standard tunnelling model ( stm ) , a phenomenological model which quite successfully accounts for many of the low temperature characteristics of amorphous solids .",
    "the stm states that at low temperatures the dominant dynamical degrees of freedom are two - level systems ( tlss ) , each tls represents an atom or a group of atoms that occupy one of two localized configuration - states that result from an asymmetric double - well potential .",
    "tlss are defined by their asymmetry energy @xmath7 and tunneling amplitude @xmath8 . given the random nature of the system , @xmath7 and @xmath9 are assumed to be distributed uniformly leading to the distribution @xmath10 .",
    "tlss reach thermal equilibrium with the phonon bath through a linear coupling to the local strain . whereas in its basic form",
    "the stm considers noninteracting tlss , tlss interact via acoustic and electric dipole interactions .",
    "tls - tls interactions result in e.g. spectral diffusion , delocalization of low energy pair excitations @xcite , and slow relaxation of dielectric and acoustic response at very low temperatures suggesting the formation of a tls glass .",
    "recent work on microfabricated devices caused a renewed interest in tlss , both for harnessing it for technological applications , for example quantum memory @xcite , and for avoiding its destructive influence as a source of noise .",
    "in particular , superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) have shown extreme sensitivity to even a single tls @xcite .",
    "this coupling of the qubit system to tlss was then used to investigate the caracharistics of individual tlss and specifically the nature of tls - tls interactions up to the accuracy of a single interacting pair @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties and dynamics of single non - interacting tlss have been studied thoroughly . in this paper , however , we are interested in the many body dynamics of the interacting tls glass , which has received less attention .    to obtain the relaxation dynamics of the tls glass we follow a similar method used previously for the electron - glass ( eg ) model@xcite .",
    "we calculate numerically the density of states of the interacting tls system in the mean - field approximation and use it to determine the tls - phonon transition rates . the total relaxation of the system is then calculated by taking the norm of the occupations vector , which are the solutions of the linearized pauli rate equation . taking the rates to the continuum and using the @xmath11 distribution of rates the logarithmic slow relaxation",
    "is obtained .",
    "furthermore , the logarithm depends on interactions and disorder through the minimum cutoff rate , @xmath12 . using this dependence we examine the qualitative affect of the interactions , disorder and systems size on the dynamics , and compare it with the eg model .",

    "for both the eg and tg models we found numerically that increasing the number of sites ( while keeping a constant density ) shifts the rate distribution to lower values . specifically for the tg model",
    ", we found the shift to be negligible whereas for the eg the effect is more pronounced .",
    "it turns out that the shift in the eg model is a finite size effect that originates from the statistics of the exponential distance matrix ( @xmath149 ) rather than from the dependence on the interactions , see app .",
    "[ appendix ] .",
    "the fact that the interactions have a negligible contribution to the change in dynamics as system size is enhanced , in both models , suggests that the relaxation modes are local in nature .    table .",

    "the @xmath153 and @xmath154 signs indicate faster and slower relaxation respectively .",
    "note that for changing the system size , the dynamics has a weak dependence on the mean - field energies ( and thus on the interaction @xmath46 ) in both models , which implies that the relaxation modes are local . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we compare the formal solutions of the eg and tg models .",
    "first , comparing eqs .",
    "( [ relaxation rate ] ) , ( [ eq : rate equation tls up to 1st order ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ rate matrix ] ) , ( [ eq : linearised rate equation eg ] ) we see that to first order of the occupation s deviations from equilibrium , the rate equation of the eg model includes electron - electron interactions ( which are neglected in our numerical calculations above ) whereas the tg rate equation has no explicit tls - tls interactions , though in both models these are implicit in the self - consistent energies .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that transitions are allowed only between pairs of states ( tlss act as dimers ) .",
    "the interactions are then between two dimers , whereas in the eg model the interactions are between single site occupations . to obtain a direct tls - tls interaction term also in the tg rate equation",
    "we expand the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master - equation tls sigma rep ] ) to second order in @xmath155 .",
    "the rate equation for tls @xmath27 is then : @xmath156 and the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate equation tls up to 2nd order ] ) is : @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath84 is the initial deviation of tls @xmath27 at the moment the external strain driving force has stopped .",
    "another consequence of the dimer approximation is the diagonal shape of the tls rate matrix in the pseudospin representation ( or block - diagonal in the state population representation ) .",
    "also , in both models the @xmath87 distribution of relaxation rates leading to logarithmic relaxation is a result of a wide and rather homogeneous distribution of an exponent , i.e. @xmath159 in eq .",
    "( [ rate matrix ] ) in the eg model and @xmath160 in the tg model .",
    "however , the range in which the @xmath87 form is satisfied is much wider in the tg model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tls rate ] ) than the eg s ( fig .  [ fig : eg 1/lambda ] ) .",
    "this is a result of the exponent in the tls glass model being chosen as homogeneous over a large regime , whereas in the eg model the tunnelling amplitude is dictated by the distribution of nearest neighbor distances , which is narrower .",
    "last , the different dependence of the rates on the mean field energies in the two models leads to the different consequences of varying the interactions , disorder , and system size on the dynamics of the two models .",
    "in this work we examine thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the tls - glass , modeled by the transverse field ising model with random @xmath0 interactions and random local fields . using mean field approximation , we first rederive the single particle dos for this model , and then derive the dynamics of its relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "similar to the electron glass model , we find @xmath11 distribution of relaxation rates , leading to logarithmic time relaxation and known memory effects in such models @xcite .",
    "we further find that increasing the disorder shifts the rate distribution to higher values , similar to what was observed for the electron glass@xcite , but increasing the interactions shifts the rate distribution to higher values while in the eg model this results in a shift to lower values@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the effect of interactions on glass dynamics is system dependent .",
    "finally , we show that the interactions have a negligible effect on the rate distribution for changing the system size at constant site density , which implies that the relaxation modes are localized .",
    "given the complexity of the eg and tg models we use the mf approximation which simplifies the calculation .",
    "it would be of interest to check our results for the dynamics of the system , some of them unexpected , against more exact numerical methods such as monte carlo simulations or exact diagonalization of finite systems .",
