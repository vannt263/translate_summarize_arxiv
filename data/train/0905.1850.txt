    "the study of the properties of elementary particles in nuclei helps to learn about not only the excitation mechanisms in the nucleus but also the properties of these particles .",
    "thus , the possible modifications of the properties of open and hidden charmed mesons in a hot and dense environment are matter of recent analysis .     and @xmath7 resonances , and the @xmath0 meson spectral function , title=\"fig:\",width=6,height=5 ]   and @xmath7 resonances , and the @xmath0 meson spectral function , title=\"fig:\",width=6,height=5 ]    the in - medium modification of the open charm mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath8 may explain the @xmath9 suppression @xcite in an hadronic environment , based on the mass reduction of @xmath10 in the nuclear medium . however , a coupled - channel meson - baryon scattering in nuclear medium is needed due to the strong coupling among the @xmath11 and other meson - baryon channels @xcite .",
    "moreover , changes in the properties of open charm will affect the renormalization of charm and hidden charm scalar mesons in nuclear matter , providing some information about their nature , whether they are @xmath12 states , molecules , mixtures of @xmath12 with meson - meson components , or dynamically generated resonances resulting from the interaction of two pseudoscalars .    in the present article , we pursue a coupled - channel study on the spectral properties of @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons in nuclear matter at finite temperature .",
    "we then analyze the effect of the self - energy of @xmath0 mesons on dynamically - generated charm and hidden charm scalar resonances , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the predicted hidden charm @xmath6 .",

    "the @xmath0 and @xmath3 self - energies at finite temperature are obtained from a self - consistent coupled - channel calculation taking , as bare interaction , a type of broken su(4 ) @xmath14-wave tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) interaction supplemented by an attractive isoscalar - scalar term ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath16 is solved using a cutoff regularization , which is fixed by reproducing the position and the width of the @xmath17 @xmath18 resonance while a new resonance in @xmath19 channel @xmath20 is then generated @xcite .",
    "the in - medium solution at finite temperature incorporates pauli blocking effects , baryon mean - field bindings via a temperature - dependent @xmath21 model , and @xmath22 and open - charm meson self - energies in the intermediate propagators ( see @xcite ) . the self - energy and , hence , spectral function are obtained self - consistently summing @xmath23 over the nucleon fermi distribution .",

    "[ fig : dn ] for three different self - consistent calculations : i ) including only the self - consistent dressing of the @xmath0 meson , ii ) adding the mean - field binding of baryons ( mfb ) and iii ) including mfb and the pion self - energy ( pd ) .",
    "the thick lines correspond to model a ( viz .",
    "@xmath25 ) while the thin - dashed lines refer to case ( iii ) within model b ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "medium effects at @xmath27 lower the position of the @xmath24 and @xmath7 with respect to their free values .",
    "their width values , which increase due to @xmath28 processes , differ according to the phase space available .",
    "the pd induces a small effect in the resonances because of charm - exchange channels being suppressed , while models a and b are qualitatively similar .",
    "finite temperature results in the reduction of the pauli blocking due to the smearing of the fermi surface with temperature .",
    "both resonances move up in energy closer to their free position while they are smoothed out , as in @xcite .    in the r.h.s of fig .",
    "[ fig : dn ] we display the @xmath0 meson spectral function for ( i ) to ( iii ) ( thick lines ) for model a and case ( iii ) for model b ( thin line ) . at @xmath27",
    "the spectral function presents two peaks : @xmath29 excitation at a lower energy whereas the second one at higher energy is the quasi(d)-particle peak mixed with the @xmath30 state .",
    "once mfb is included , the lower peak built up by the @xmath29 mode goes up by about @xmath31 mev relative to ( i ) since the meson requires to carry more energy to compensate for the attraction felt by the nucleon .",
    "the same characteristic feature is seen for the @xmath30 configuration that mixes with the quasiparticle peak .",
    "the pd does not alter much the position of @xmath32 excitation or the quasiparticle peak . for model b ( ( iii ) only ) , the absence of the @xmath15 term moves the @xmath29 excitation closer to the quasiparticle peak , while the latter fully mixes with the @xmath30 excitation . at finite temperature those structures dilute with increasing temperature while the quasiparticle peak gets closer to its free value becoming narrower , because the self - energy receives contributions from higher momentum @xmath11 pairs where the interaction is weaker .    in the @xmath33 sector , the scattering lengths for model a ( b )",
    "are @xmath34 fm and @xmath35 fm .",
    "while our repulsive @xmath19 is in good agreement with @xcite , the finite value for the @xmath17 scattering length found in this latter reference is in contrast to the zero value found here for model b due to the vanishing @xmath17 coupling coefficient of the corresponding pure tw @xmath36 interaction .",
    "our results are , however , consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite . for model",
    "a , we obtain a non - zero value of the @xmath17 scattering length , due to the magnitude of the @xmath15 term . as seen in the l.h.s of fig .",
    "[ fig : dbarn ] , the @xmath3 mass shift in cold nuclear matter is repulsive and , in spite of the absence of resonances close to threshold , the low - density approximation or @xmath37 breaks down at normal nuclear matter density @xmath38 .    finally , in the r.h.s of fig .",
    "[ fig : dbarn ] we compare the @xmath0 and @xmath3 optical potentials . for model a ( b ) at @xmath27",
    ", we obtain an attractive potential of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) mev for the @xmath0 meson , similar to @xcite , while the repulsion for @xmath3 is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) mev .",
    "the temperature dependence of the repulsive real part of the @xmath43 optical potential is very weak , while the imaginary part increases steadily due to the increase of collisional width .",
    "the picture is somewhat different for the @xmath0 meson due to the overlap of the quasiparticle peak with the @xmath44 mode .",

    "we can not only learn about the excitation mechanisms in the nucleus but also the properties of these particles .",
    "we study the charmed resonances @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite together with a hidden charm scalar meson , @xmath6 , predicted in @xcite , which might have been observed by the belle collaboration @xcite via the reanalysis of @xcite .",
    "those resonances are generated dynamically solving the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation for two pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the kernel is derived from a @xmath48 extension of the @xmath49 chiral lagrangian used to generate scalar resonances in the light sector .",
    "the @xmath48 symmetry is , however , strongly broken , mostly due to the explicit consideration of the masses of the vector mesons exchanged between pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the transition amplitude close to each resonance for the different coupled channels give us information about the coupling of the resonance to a particular channel .",
    "the @xmath4 mainly couples to @xmath50 system , while the @xmath45 to @xmath51 and , secondly , to @xmath52 . and the hidden charm state @xmath6 couples most strongly to @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , any change in the @xmath0 meson properties in nuclear matter will have an important effect on these resonances .",
    "those modifications are given by the @xmath0 meson self - energy in nuclear matter , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] , but supplemented by the @xmath54-wave self - energy through the corresponding @xmath55 excitations @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the resonances @xmath4 and @xmath45 and @xmath6 are shown by displaying the squared transition amplitude for the corresponding dominant channel at different densities . in the case of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 resonances , which have a zero and small width , respectively , the medium effects lead to widths of the order of 100 and 200 mev at normal nuclear matter density , correspondingly .",
    "the origin can be traced back to the opening of new many - body decay channels , as the @xmath0 meson gets absorbed in the nuclear medium via @xmath11 and @xmath56 inelastic reactions .",
    "for the @xmath45 , we observe an extra widening from the already large width of the resonance in free space .",
    "however , the large original width makes the medium effects comparatively much weaker than for the other two resonances @xcite . in our model",
    ", we do not extract any clear conclusion for the mass shift .",
    "we suggest to look at transparency ratios to investigate those in - medium widths .",
    "this magnitude , which gives the survival probability in production reactions in nuclei , is very sensitive to the absorption rate of any resonance inside nuclei , i.e. , to its in - medium width .",
    "we have studied the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons within a self - consistent coupled - channel approach for the experimental conditions expected at the cbm experiment at fair .",
    "the in - medium @xmath3 mass increases by about @xmath57 mev whereas the @xmath0 spectral function extends to lower `` mass '' due to the thermally spread @xmath58 .",
    "however , it is unlikely to explain @xmath9 suppression via the @xmath59 decay in hot dense matter .",
    "a more plausible hadronic contribution for the @xmath9 suppression is the reduction of its supply from the excited charmonia , @xmath60 or @xmath61 , which may find in the medium other competitive decay channels .",
    "we have also evaluated the renormalized properties in nuclear matter of the charm scalar @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the predicted hidden charm @xmath6 resonances .",
    "those resonances develop an important width in this dense environment .",
    "we conclude that the experimental analysis of those properties is a valuable test of the dynamics of the @xmath0 meson interaction with nucleons and nuclei , and the nature of those charm and hidden charm scalar resonances .",
    "altogether , those results should stimulate experimental work in hadron facilities , in particular at fair @xcite , where the charm degree of freedom will be throughly investigated ."
