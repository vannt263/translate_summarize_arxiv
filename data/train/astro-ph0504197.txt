    "study of the knots in kilo parsec scale jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been given a new dimension after the advent of _ chandra _ which due to its excellent spatial resolution is able to resolve bright x - ray knots of such jets @xcite .",
    "in most of the cases , the x - ray knots coincide with their radio / optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "the discovery of such knots in different energy bands provides useful information about the basic emission mechanism and the underlying acceleration processes involved there .",
    "the radio and optical emission from these knots are generally accepted to be of synchrotron origin , whereas the x - ray emission can be due to either synchrotron @xcite or inverse compton processes @xcite .",
    "if the radio - to - optical index ( @xmath3 ) is larger than the optical - to - x - ray index ( @xmath4 ) , a single emission mechanism can not explain the observed fluxes ( however see @xcite who show that if klein - nishina losses is important , spectral hardening can occur ) and the x - ray emission may be due to inverse comptonization",
    ". on the other hand , if @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath4 , synchrotron origin of x - ray is acceptable @xcite .",
    "this synchrotron origin of x - rays for knots with @xmath5 , was strengthened for the knots of @xmath6 by @xcite who show that the alternate inverse compton model would require exceptionally large doppler factors . when the x - ray emission can be attributed to the inverse compton process ,",
    "the possible choices of target photons are radio / optical synchrotron photons ( ssc)@xcite or the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb)@xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ssc interpretation would require large jet powers and magnetic fields much lower than the equipartition values whereas ic / cmb requires relatively low jet power and near equipartition magnetic fields .",
    "these possible radiative process identifications have to be associated with ( and confirmed by ) dynamical models regarding the origin and subsequent evolution of the radiating non - thermal particles . in many models ,",
    "these non - thermal particles are assumed to be generated by a short duration acceleration process and the particle distribution is determined by radiative losses @xcite .",
    "the high energy particles cool more efficiently and hence get depleted in time , giving rise to a time - dependent high energy cut off in the non - thermal particle distribution .",
    "if the x - ray emission is attributed to synchrotron emission by these particles , then these models predict an exponentially decreasing x - ray spectrum @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it may also be possible that the acceleration process exists for longer than the age of the knot , and hence , there is a continuous injection of non - thermal particles . in this case ,",
    "a time dependent break in the non - thermal particle distribution occurs at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is determined by the condition that the cooling time - scale for electrons with @xmath7 is equal to the age of the knot @xcite .",
    "this model predicts the x - ray spectral index @xmath9 to be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radio spectral index .",
    "thus the predicted spectrum depends , in particular , on the duration of the non - thermal particle production and , in general , on the production mechanism .",
    "while there is no consensus on the origin of these non - thermal particles , one of the standard models is the internal shock scenario @xcite , where the particles are energized by fermi acceleration in shocks produced during the interaction of relativistically moving blobs ejected from the central engines with different speeds .",
    "this model has also been used to explain the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the shock formation and subsequent electron acceleration is complicated and would require numerically difficult magneto - hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "moreover , the limited number of observables , which can be obtained from the featureless spectra in two or three different energy bands , may not be able to constrain the various assumption and/or the initial conditions of such a detailed study .",
    "nevertheless , a qualitative idea as to whether the internal shock model is consistent with the present observations and if so , qualitative estimates of the model parameters would be desirable . such an estimate will provide insight into the temporal behavior of the central engine .    in this work , we implement an internal shock model with simplifying assumptions and compute the time - evolution of the non - thermal particles produced .",
    "we compare the results obtained with the broad - band fluxes from knots of several agn jets and their observed positions .",
    "the motivation here is to find a consistent set of model parameters that can explain the observations and thereby make qualitative estimates of their values . apart from the fluxes at different energy bands , the spectral indices in each band can also provide important diagnostic information about the nature of these sources .",
    "hence , we have analyzed long ( @xmath0 ksec ) _ chandra _ observations of three agn and report the constrains that were obtained on the x - ray spectral indices of the individual knots .    in the next section , a brief description of the data analysis technique and the results obtained are presented . in ",

    "in the internal shock model framework , temporal variations of the ejection process produces density fluctuations ( moving with different velocities ) which collide at some distance from the source to produce an observable knot .",
    "this distance will depend on the time - scale over which the variation takes place .",
    "in general the system will exhibit variations over a wide range of time - scales and knots like features would be produced at different distance scales . in this work ,",
    "we consider large scale jets ( with deprojected distances @xmath69 kpc ) which are expected to arise from variability occurring on a corresponding large time - scale .",

    "eqn ( [ evol ] ) can be solved analytically @xcite or numerically computed using the technique given in @xcite . rather than the complete analytical expression it is perhaps more illuminating to study the asymptotic limits .",
    "it is convenient to define a critical lorentz factor @xmath8 for which the cooling time - scale for synchrotron and ic losses is equal to the observation time @xmath100 .",
    "then for @xmath101 , there is effectively no cooling and the particle spectrum is @xmath102 i.e. the injection rate times the observed time . for @xmath103",

    "the knot closer to the nucleus is referred to as knot a and the further one as knot b. for these sources this nomenclature is same as in the literature except for @xmath17 where the farther one has been referred to as knot a. for three of these sources , the x - ray spectral indices were constrained using long exposure observations as described in  2 .",
    "the observed properties of the sources and the knots are tabulated in table @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "figure @xmath141 shows the observed radio , optical and x - ray fluxes of these knots , along with the computed spectra corresponding to model parameters that are given in table @xmath143 .",
    "since the number of parameters is large as compared to the observables , a unique set of parameter values can not be obtained .",
    "two consistency checks have been imposed on the parameter values , which are that the number of non - thermal electrons which will be injected into the system , @xmath136 , is smaller than the total number of protons , @xmath144 , and that the magnetic field , @xmath145 is less than the equipartition value , @xmath139 .",
    "both these conditions are satisfied by the parameter sets as shown in table @xmath143 , where the ratios @xmath146 and @xmath147 are given .      for each source , the time delay , @xmath73 , between the ejection of the two blobs which form the knots are nearly equal to the time difference between the ejection of the first blobs of knot a and knot b , @xmath130 .",
    "this gives an overall _ single _ time - scale of activity for each source which ranges from @xmath148 sec which can reproduce the knot properties as had been assumed in the development of the simple internal shock model .",
    "this result is important since if it had not been true a more complex temporal behavior would have to be proposed , wherein the jet structure is due to variability of the source in two different time - scales .",
    "the first being the time difference between the ejection of two blobs that form a knot and the second being the time difference between the activities that produced the two knots .",

    ", i.e. the time when there is injection of particles into the system , the knot would travel a distance @xmath151 kpc .",
    "this is a significant fraction of the total observable distance traveled by the knot , from formation @xmath152 kpc ( see table 3 ) to the termination of the jet in the radio lobe , @xmath153 kpc .",
    "hence , as shown in table 4 , it is possible to fit the spectra of all the knots , with an observation time , @xmath154 which is less than the crossing over time , @xmath90 implying that there is continuous injection of particles into the system . in this scenario ,",
    "the synchrotron and ic spectra have a break corresponding to a lorentz factor , @xmath8 , where the cooling time - scale equals the observation time @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to one - time injection models ( i.e. when @xmath155 ) where an exponential cutoff in the spectra occurs .",
