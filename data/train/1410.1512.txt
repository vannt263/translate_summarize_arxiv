    "a famous experiment @xcite reporting an abnormal light transmission ( a few percent ) through subwavelength hole arrays , sparked off a great surge of interest in the optical properties of nano - structured metallic surfaces .",
    "the authors initially advocated the unique role of surface plasmons .",
    "it is true that such modes are significantly present in the visible range , on noble metals .",
    "nevertheless , subwavelength apertures , intrinsically , behave also as dipole antennas that are supposed to scatter a continuum of evanescent waves and quasi - omnidirectional space ones . in particular , these light waves may be preponderant at the close vicinity of the apertures , and can participate quantitatively to extraordinary transmission @xcite .",
    "in other cases , taking narrow slits , dipolar interactions are responsible for some local enhancements and far - field modulations @xcite .",
    "following many debates @xcite about the actual mediation of extraordinary transmission at _ optical _ frequencies ( plasmon , surface lightwaves , or a mixture of them , depending on spectral window and geometry ) , efforts were done to finely describe analytically the electromagnetic field scattered by a slit , often reduced as a punctual source @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to find a closed - form expression when the ( complex ) metal permittivity is finite , as known in the antennas context @xcite .",
    "an intriguing result is the change of spatial damping of the non - plasmonic contribution far from the source , at the metal level @xcite , which is reminiscent of a norton - type wave @xcite i.e. a ground radio wave @xcite .",
    "one could believe that a kind of surface field with the wavevector of _ light _ is also launched along the metal , together with the polariton , as a companion - wave that exchanges energy , but this terminology is not really appropriated , as we will see .    in most papers interested in this question , a purely mathematical approach of the scattering integral , strictly at the surface level , and with a punctual scatterer ,",
    "is only partly satisfactory as we miss essential features to have a complete picture of the electromagnetic entity we actually consider .",
    "an analysis discriminating each contribution , in the broad space , and giving an explicit physical interpretation , is still lacking .",
    "thus , this paper aims to refresh our vision in a practical way , and shows that the lateral norton wave generated by a slit constitutes a _ third _ electromagnetic contribution taking birth in the whole horizontal conducting surface .",
    "as this radiating subfield combines with the conventional dipole field in a special manner , it results in a weak apparent surface wave , however fundamentally different from a surface polariton .",
    "we will exemplify theoretical results essentially with gold in the infrared , but for sake of generality , the case of amorphous silicon ( asi ) in the ultraviolet region will be sometimes illustrated since this material may also exhibit a metal - like behaviour ( with strong absorbing properties ) .     of the guided mode ( [ ng ] ) and that of the aperture function @xmath0 ( [ su ] ) for the polariton wave ( [ hsp ] ) , depending on the slit width , and for three wavelengths ( @xmath1 m ) , taking either the permittivity of gold , either that of amorphous silicon @xcite .",

    "as a tutorial case , we revisit the problem in the framework of the simplified , highly instructive modal method , by taking into account the fundamental waveguide mode inside the sub-@xmath4 one - dimensional ( 1d ) slit , in tm polarization ( see fig.[figure1](a ) ) . in this paper",
    ", we _ do not _ consider the indentation as a punctual scatterer .    take a material with a permittivity @xmath5 strongly negative . the surface impedance boundary conditions are applicable while tangential wave vectors of the scattered waves are much smaller than @xmath6 , i.e. ,    @xmath7^{1/2}\\approx k\\sqrt{\\varepsilon } , \\label{kperp}\\ ] ]    in the metal , where @xmath8",
    "this is widely the case for noble metals in the infrared region and for reasonably sub - wavelength geometries .",
    "we will note @xmath9 the surface impedance ( small and essentially imaginary ) .",

    "the effective index of a fundamental mode which is vertically guided along the slit is :    @xmath18    this mode is built by the antisymmetric coupling of wall plasmons .",
    "@xmath19 is the fourier transform of its eigenfunction , and @xmath20 its excitation coefficient @xcite ( @xmath21 but it has no importance in the forthcoming discussion ) .",
    "the scattering integral ( [ htot ] ) , that is to say the _ field structure _ , is what interests us in this paper , and is _ independent _ of the slit reaction .",
    "it is worth recalling that @xmath22 at air / metal interfaces .",
    "first , let us briefly comment the perfect metal case . when @xmath23 inside the slit ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , we immediately get @xmath26 . and",
    "if the metal is perfect everywhere , the scattered field may be exactly@xcite turned into an integral of some zero order hankel function of the first kind @xmath27 over the slit width ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "consequently , the field scattered in any direction is : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this solution verifies the sommerfeld radiation condition .",
    "it is a _ cylindrical _ , dipole - type field . besides , it is possible to show that @xmath31 has an almost identical expression , so that the power flux @xmath32 propagating along the perfect metal surface has a _",
    "@xmath33 spatial damping _ , for @xmath34 .",
    "let us come back to the real metal case and put aside the specular term in ( [ htot ] ) .",
    "we know the scattered field ( [ htot ] ) is the sum of two main contributions : a surface polariton ( sp ) mode ( plasmon for a metal , phonon for an ionic crystal in the restsrahlen band , zenneck wave for other lossy materials @xcite ... ) and a `` photonic '' field ressembling the dipole - type field ( [ hperf ] ) of the perfect metal case , say : @xmath35 the proper pole of the integrand corresponds to the tranverse plasma oscillation generated by each metallic edge of the aperture . applying the residue theorem , for @xmath11 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . for @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 still has a plasmonic nature since it is supported by the guided mode of the cavity .",
    "eq.@xmath41 ( not really new ) explains the trade - off on the ratio @xmath42 to generate a strong and long - range surface polariton mode .",
    "the aperture function @xmath43 also implies that when @xmath44 , destructive interferences annihilate the polariton whatever the slit reaction ( see fig[figure1](b ) ) .",
    "however , for some materials with @xmath45 , the cutoff - width condition is never fully fulfilled ( see the amorphous silicon case ) and a weak surface polariton can always be launched from the slit . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath46 , the waveguide index @xmath47 exhibits an increasing imaginary part ( absorption ) which may attenuate the @xmath20 coefficient , and then , the sp generation , as experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "width at @xmath48 .",
    "( a ) field modulus , ( b ) real part .",
    "@xmath49 is the scattering integral ( [ htot ] ) taking @xmath50.[figure2 ] ]    before going ahead , figure [ figure2 ] gives a numerical example showing the weight of each magnetic component scattered over a gold surface at @xmath51 m ( @xmath52 nm ) .",
    "while the plasmon and the photonic field are both proportional to the coefficient @xmath20 , @xmath53 predominates in the neighbouring of the sub-@xmath4 aperture , with a damping similar to that of the perfect metal case . due to",
    "different spatial damping , the polariton is rapidly the majority mode over many wavelengths .",
    "this is a general behaviour provided that @xmath54 and/or @xmath55 ( fig.[figure1](b ) ) are not too small .",
    "however , the underlying physics is far from being complete . indeed , on the basis of ref.@xcite",
    ", one can show that the photonic field near the slit may be expressed analytically thanks to a fine correction of the field of the perfect metal case ( numerically verified in fig.[figure2](b ) ) . while @xmath56 ,",
    "and for @xmath57 , the real case gives :    @xmath58    the correction @xmath59 seems related to some energy transfer to the surface polariton , when we compare it to eq.([hsp ] ) .",
    "the propagating terms @xmath60 are stranger as they are not linked to absorption losses , but to small out - of - phase _",
    "radiations_. actually , as we will detail hereafter , in the real metal case , light waves come from at least _ two _ contributions , that is to say @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an enveloppe function comprising always the dipolar ( cylindrical ) field , but hiding another radiating subfield which is _ not _ cylindrical . to show this , not only at the surface level , but in the whole space , a relevant approach is to study the asymptotical behaviour of the field far enough from the aperture .",
    "this is the subject of the following section .",
    "to find the asymptotical behaviour of the far field , a way consists in resorting to a double second - order taylor expansion . indeed",
    ", let us consider again the integral ( [ htot ] ) .",
    "one may put the phase @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we will apply the stationnary phase method for @xmath65 .",
    "it can be intuitively understood that , although the field results from the contribution of a whole continuum of wave vectors , the oscillations of the exponential become extremely rapid at large distance , with destructive interference of the spectrum , except when the phase @xmath66 is nearly constant , close to an extremum .",
    "the condition @xmath67 is indeed fulfilled for a unique wave vector @xmath68 , which corresponds to a radiated field .",
    "thus , around @xmath69 : @xmath70.\\ ] ]    a taylor expansion of @xmath71 is also applied , noticing that the first order term @xmath72 will be null .",
    "we are then driven to calculate different fresnel integrals .",
    "if we introduce polar coordinates , by naturally putting @xmath73 , with @xmath74 $ ] an angle defined with respect to the @xmath75 axis , we finally get : @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 .\\ ] ] high order terms or minor ones ( see appendix b ) are neglected . through several simulations ,",
    "we find a typical validity threshold @xmath80 over which the asymptotical expression of @xmath81 starts to fit with the numerically calculated field , at the surface .",
    "let us get insight into both electromagnetic entities obtained .",
    "the first contribution @xmath82 is the conventional dipolar field , which is actually valid whatever @xmath83 .",
    "we analytically see that when @xmath23 , we retrieve the perfect metal case with a far - field persisting at the surface ( @xmath84 ) with a @xmath85 damping .",
    "but when @xmath86 , @xmath87 : we have the appearance of a shadow zone @xcite ( adjacent to the surface ) for the radiated power , leaving only the place to the surface polariton and @xmath81 , when we are sufficiently far from the cavity .",
    "( [ hdip ] ) , @xmath88 ( [ hn ] ) , and of the sum @xmath89 ( [ hphot ] ) taking gold at @xmath48 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 : ( a ) @xmath92 m ( b ) @xmath93 m .",
    "( c ) @xmath94 ( [ theta ] ) for some values of @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "[ figure3 ] ]    the second one , noted @xmath81 , is what has a direct link with the so - called norton wave .",
    "this light field is not a real surface one , although spatially concentrated due to its rapid decrease in radial amplitude .",
    "the radiation pattern @xmath97 is a meaningful result as it will indicate the physical origin of these additional lightwaves . for grazing angles , it is not null at the surface but proportional to @xmath98 , which could be high if it was not counterbalanced by the @xmath99 damping .",
    "other calculations@xcite , made for a punctual scatterer , seem to be consistent with this @xmath5 factor , but this has not been commented . besides , @xmath81 presents an intrinsic phase quadrature with respect to @xmath82 , hence possible destructive interferences of both fields in polar directions where they present close amplitudes .",
    "although @xmath88 is not unambiguously given for small @xmath100 , eq.([hphz ] ) would be an indication that @xmath88 is likely present and immersed into the preponderant dipole field .",
    "it is worth noting that , by strictly keeping cartesian coordinates and taking @xmath101 close to the surface , one gets a @xmath102 behaviour @xcite for @xmath103 but this is misleading : the true wave which is non - null at the surface with a @xmath104 damping is @xmath105 .",
    "we recall that the fields described here are generated by a scatterer that extends infinitely in one of the spatial dimensions . for a _ point _ scatterer , like in the well - known sommerfeld problem@xcite , the field of a surface plasmon ( or a zenneck surface mode ) behaves as @xmath106 whereas the norton wave is as @xmath107 .     and gold at @xmath48 : @xmath108 results from the exact integral ( [ htot ] ) taking @xmath50",
    ", @xmath109 is ( [ hsp ] ) , @xmath110 is ( [ htot])-([hsp ] ) , and @xmath81 results here from ( [ htot])- ( [ hsp])-([hdip ] ) .",
    "let us recall that calculus of @xmath81 through this subtraction is not valid close to the aperture .",
    "as @xmath111 just above the aperture , max of scales are willingly limited to better highlight the details of the scattering patterns .",
    "the white star refers to a spatial zone where various field components are detailed in fig.[figure5].[figure4 ] ]    figure [ figure3](a ) shows the behaviour of the total light field @xmath110 and that of its inner components .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath82 is quasi - isotropic , typical of a rayleigh scattering .",
    "@xmath81 is clearly different and presents two horizontal half - lobes at each side of the cavity , which are physically _ connected _ to the metallic surface .",
    "but the remarkable effect is that combination of @xmath82 and @xmath81 strongly modifies the final radiation pattern of @xmath110 : it _ gives the impression _ that a residual surface wave slides along the metal ( @xmath112 ) , that is not of plasmonic nature .",
    "we also understand here that the _ transition _ from a @xmath113 damping ( near the cavity ) to a @xmath114 ( far away from it ) at the surface , already observed @xcite , is due to _ a change of the major scattering contribution _ ( from the dipole / cylindrical field towards the norton field ) , without change of the surface wavevector @xmath115 .",
    "purely numerical simulations can not allow us to explain such a continuous transition , without analytical developments .",
    "outside the shadow zone , i.e. quite above the surface , we find the preponderant dipolar space field .",
    "other remarks can be made : as exemplified in fig.[figure3](b ) , when @xmath116 , @xmath81 vanishes ( the surface polariton vanishes even more , according to fig.[figure1](b ) ) and the radiation lobe of @xmath53 becomes more focused in the normal direction , which may present some interest to transmit light in a less dispersed beam .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath117 for some arbitrary values of @xmath95 or @xmath96 is also given in fig.[figure3](c ) .",
    "when @xmath118 , the semi - lobes of @xmath119 remain flattened against the surface , and the polar angle corresponding to their maximum amplitude tends to @xmath120 .",
    "the space of validity of ( [ hn ] ) is also rejected to infinity : at end , only @xmath82 becomes relevant , and we retrieve the perfect metal case .    .",
    "this spatial region is indicated by a white star in the @xmath110 map of figure [ figure4 ] . the plasmonic and photonic contributions are also superposed .",
    "the photonic field comprises the dipolar field ( null at the surface ) and the norton one .",
    "insert ( b ) gives details of the photonic part near the surface ( numerically and analytically calculated ) .",
    "one can show by hand that @xmath121 is the ordinate of a plane along which @xmath110 cancels , whatever @xmath122 ( for large @xmath100 ) .",
    "[ figure5 ] ]",
    "what is the physical source of @xmath81 ? if we remind the @xmath31 arrows in fig.[figure1](a ) , we have an effective _ vertical _ electric dipole at the aperture level ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "this vertical momentum is responsible for the norton wave generation , whereas the _ horizontal _ momentum @xmath123 , at the mouth of the aperture , forms the classic oscillating dipole ( hence the phase quadrature between ( [ hdip ] ) and ( [ hn ] ) ) .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation @xmath81 is linked to induced surface currents occuring in the skin - depth of both metallic parts forming the slit .",
    "indeed , the cavity can be viewed as a capacity under illumination whereas horizontal metallic parts play the role of ( dissipative ) inductances @xcite . the current component @xmath124 which is guided along the surface corresponds to an oscillating field having the wave vector of the free space ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "thus , while @xmath125 , the _ surface itself radiates _ ( infrared waves , in our example ) and behaves as a uniform _ leaky - wave - antenna _ @xcite .",
    "the surface polariton has nothing to do with it , but simply superposes to the norton field , and does not radiate .",
    "thus , a great difference is that @xmath126 is damped due to absorption ( see eq.[hsp ] ) ) whereas @xmath81 is dissipated through emission .",
    "they have not the same @xmath95-dependence .",
    "the @xmath5 amplitude of @xmath127 , when @xmath128 , seems related to a limit of the spreading of the surfacic charge around the slit ( according to the metal conductivity ) .",
    "also , as observed in fig.[figure3 ] , there is a grazing angle @xmath129 for which @xmath130 meets a maximum .",
    "this angle is close to the pseudo - brewster angle defined for metals , that is to say the emissivity of the radiating surface is maximum for polar directions where its reflectivity should be minimum ( in tm - polarization ) .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] gathers some fully calculated maps of the total scattered field ( [ htot ] ) and its inner components .",
    "the first map clearly shows the conventional dipole - type radiation , the surface polariton , and the presence of a shadow zone .",
    "while @xmath53 reveals a non - negligible amplitude near the aperture , the existence of a radiating field @xmath119 localized along the whole surface is confirmed by simply subtracting the polariton ( [ hsp ] ) and the dipolar field ( [ hdip ] ) from the total field . the new map exhibits the scattering lobes with a butterfly shape predicted by the @xmath127 function . _",
    "this physical picture has gone unnoticed in the literature devoted to optics of metallic nano - structures_. additional details of the photonic component near the surface , far from the slit , are displayed in fig.[figure5 ] . along a direction normal to the surface , it well presents a small amplitude at the metal level ( same value given by ( [ hn ] ) taking into account the finite size @xmath131 ) , cancels rapidly at the nodal plane @xmath132^{-1}$ ] , and increases again when one progressively enters the dipolar lobe , as expected from fig.[figure3](a ) .",
    "whereas the true norton field extends over a few wavelengths in the @xmath75 direction , its combination with the dipole field reduces to a virtual surface wave .",
    "however , the plasmon wave remains overwhelming at the interface , due to its low damping on gold surface in the mid - infrared .",
    "nm , with @xmath2 @xcite ( @xmath133 ) and @xmath134 .",
    "modulus of the total field and that of its plasmonic and radiative components : ( a ) near the slit ( for @xmath112 ) , ( b ) far from the slit at the surface level , and ( c ) far from the slit above the silicon at @xmath135 . we check that the analytical expression ( [ hn ] ) of @xmath119 at the surface well reflects the numerically calculated lightfield while @xmath80 .",
    "( d ) real part of @xmath81.[figure6 ] ]    on an experimental level , the norton - type wave will be really apparent provided that the sp collapses , i.e. faraway from the source , or for strongly absorbing materials .",
    "so , instead of gold , let us consider the case of amorphous silicon in the ultraviolet region .",
    "indeed , @xmath136 behaves as a metal and shows strong absorbing properties in this spectral domain .",
    "figures [ figure6](a ) and ( b ) display the amplitudes of the field scattered at the surface , for two ranges of distance , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( @xmath139 nm ) . the total field ( [ htot ] ) is compared to analytical expressions of each physical contribution ( in their domain of validity ) . near the slit ,",
    "the light field is always predominant . when @xmath140 , the spp becomes the stronger contribution but the total field keeps a lower amplitude . above @xmath141 ,",
    "the total field presents an amplitude stronger than @xmath142 . finally , very far from the slit ( see fig . [ figure6](b ) ) , for @xmath143 , the polariton completely vanishes whereas the norton - field remains dominant ( well described by eq.([hn ] ) ) .",
    "this is all the more notable when we evaluate @xmath144 a little bit above the surface , at @xmath145 for instance , as shown in fig.[figure6](c ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath146 may present an amplitude greater than that of the total field . at @xmath147 (",
    "not shown ) , the sp field is negligible , the dipolar field is prevalent , and the norton field still exists but with a weaker amplitude .",
    "the chosen example , here , may suggest a challenging experiment to better observe and quantify the predicted wave ( instead of a gold surface ) , with a wavefront sensor@xcite for instance .",
    "let us note that , if the surface impedance model is less rigorous in the visible , with moderate permittivity moduli , we can meet the same behaviour , in the infrared region , with other materials like titanium nitride ( tin ) which behaves as an absorbing metal ( for example , @xmath148 at @xmath149 m @xcite , and a special demonstration at telecom wavelength could be welcome ) .",
    "the scattered surface fields should be preferably probed at the opposite side of the slit , in order to omit the interference of the exciting ( incident ) wave .",
    "what is more , to enhance the field amplitudes ( i.e. @xmath20 ) , the slit height should be roughly @xmath150 to generate a well - known fabry - perot resonance . instead of a narrow slit , a patch antenna ( horizontal cavity )",
    "could also launch norton and plasmon waves , as the lateral apertures are the sites of vertical electrical fields .",
    "as a conclusion , this paper brings comprehensive analytical and numerical results which shed light on a particular kind of electromagnetic wave scattered by a narrow slit on metal ( or highly conducting ) surfaces .",
    "its physical source and behaviour , in the broad space and at optical frequencies , had not been clearly identified in the scientific literature until now .",
    "indeed , the well - known surface plasmon and the classic dipolar light field are not the only contributions .",
    "a lateral norton - type wave also exists , most often immersed within the scattered field .",
    "this is _ not _ a cylindrical field , neither a true surface wave , nor a proper mode of a flat metallic interface , but a reaction to a polarized excitation : it features a special radiation pattern ( @xmath127 function ) taking its origin into induced surface currents residing in the metal skin depth and generated by the dipole aperture ( excited by the vertical electrical momentum ) .    considering noble metals , this field might generally have too weak absolute amplitude to be practically exploited in systems of photonic size , but depending on other frequencies and permittivities ( as illustrated above , in the paper ) , it may become a relevant wave to convey information faraway at interfaces ( not necessarily flat ) .",
    "for example , such norton waves are expected to be the best candidate to transmit microwave signals on the ( conducting ) human skin , because zenneck - surface modes are loosely excited@xcite .",
    "although the present work does not aim at revisiting the extraordinary optical transmission ( eot ) ( taken as a starting context ) , an open question could be to know to which extent @xcite radiation from induced currents may be channeled through diffraction orders and participate to eot .",
    "indeed , in some cases , eot can not be assisted by plamons , but by other vectors with materials whose permittivity exhibits an imaginary part and a positive real part@xcite .",
    "one can also wonder if there is an equivalent of the norton - type surface radiance in acoustics @xcite .",
    "thus , this deeper fundamental understanding of the canonical slit case , that bridges the gap between nano - optics and leaky - wave antennas , may inspire further investigations and other ways of lightwave engineering , with structures more elaborate .",
    "this section gives some analytical expressions of the electromagnetic fields scattered at the surface ( @xmath112 ) by a narrow one - dimensional slit ( supporting a fundamental guided mode ) , in the case of the perfect reflector .",
    "results are based on the exact integral eq.([htot ] ) .      as @xmath151 ( excepting a @xmath152 factor )",
