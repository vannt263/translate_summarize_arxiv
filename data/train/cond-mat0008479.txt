    "recent work has seen unprecedented advances in the preparation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of dilute alkali vapors @xcite . these quantum degenerate systems have paved the way for numerous innovative studies of weakly interacting bose gases .",
    "an important area within this field is the generation and study of quantized vortices on atomic mesoscopic rings and the potential to study effects due to persistent currents and josephson effects @xcite .",
    "central to such studies is investigation of geometries for generation of a bec in a toroidal trap @xcite .",
    "typically bec is created in a magnetic trap that confines atoms in weak - field seeking states and is thus dependent on the atomic hyperfine states .",
    "a toroidal trap can then be formed by piercing a magnetic trap with a blue - detuned laser at its center @xcite . however , the state dependence of the trapping is a limitation for advanced studies including multi - component spinor condensates .",
    "further , the magnetic field is primarily dictated by the trapping requirements setting limitations on its spatial form and amplitude .",
    "optical dipole traps can potentially circumvent these problems being state independent @xcite .",
    "importantly , the spatial form of the optical trap is dictated by the light beams used .",
    "this allows one to potentially generate arbitrary shapes of condensate @xcite .",
    "experimental work has shown the ability to transfer a condensate from a magnetic trap to an optical dipole trap created from a tightly focused gaussian light beam @xcite .",
    "the circularly symmetric laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) laser modes have generated substantial interest in recent years .",
    "this stems from the identification that they possess an orbital angular momentum of @xmath0 per photon @xcite .",
    "this is in addition to the spin angular momentum associated with the polarization state of the beam .",
    "the azimuthal index @xmath1 refers to the number of @xmath2 phase cycles around the mode circumference .",
    "a given mode has @xmath3 radial nodes in the mode profile where @xmath4 is the other index used in the lg mode description .",
    "one finds that lg beams with radial index @xmath5 are in the form of an annulus @xcite .",
    "there are several techniques for production of lg modes including the use of a cylindrical lens mode converter @xcite and holographic methods @xcite .",
    "the latter technique allows generation of lg modes from the fundamental output of a laser beam . the annulus becomes thinner as one increases the azimuthal index @xmath1 of the mode @xcite .    in this work we present a technique for generating a toroidal bec employing a laguerre - gaussian light beam .",
    "single - ringed forms of such beams offer for the first time a direct possibility of generating ring - shaped condensates in an optical potential .",
    "we study the operation of this dipole trap as a function of azimuthal mode index and discuss the loading of condensates into such optical traps from a variety of initial conditions .",
    "the basic model we consider is shown in fig . 1 and comprises a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bec whose normalized mode profile is frozen by tight confinement along the @xmath6-direction , and which is placed at the focus of an off - resonant lg laser beam of frequency @xmath7 incident along the @xmath6-axis that provides a two - dimensional optical potential @xcite .",
    "the tight confinement may be provided , for example , by an independent sheet potential using a scanned optical dipole potential @xcite . then the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) describing the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath8 for the quasi-2d motion",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the two - dimensional position vector in the plane perpendicular to @xmath6 , @xmath11 the corresponding two - dimensional laplacian , @xmath12 is the atomic mass , and @xmath13 is the effective short - range interaction strength .",
    "the potential term on the right - hand - side @xmath14 describes the 2d optical dipole potential with @xmath15 the laser detuning from the optical transition frequency @xmath16 , @xmath17 the natural linewidth of the optical transition , @xmath18 is the resonant saturation intensity , and @xmath19 , assuming the bec is centered at @xmath20 and has a thickness less than the rayleigh range of the focused beam .",
    "in addition , we assume that the intensity profile of the lg beam is undistorted upon propagation through the 2d bec , which is reasonable for a thin bec .",
    "we remark , however , that the lg beam becomes spatially phase - modulated upon transiting the bec , resulting in a changed far field profile of the beam that could prove a useful diagnostic of the bec density profile .    for later purposes we point out the gpe conserves both the wave function norm @xmath21 and",
    "also the effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath22      our goal in this work is to explore theoretically the use of lg beams for producing toroidal optical dipole traps , the dipole potential being proportional to the laser intensity in the limit of large detunings considered here .",
    "the intensity profile of an lg beam at its focus ( @xmath20 ) in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath23 ) takes the form @xmath24 ^ 2   , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the beam power , @xmath1 is the azimuthal mode index , the field having a variation @xmath26 , @xmath4 is the radial mode index which is the number of radial intensity maxima , @xmath27 is the mode spot size , and @xmath28 is a generalized laguerre polynomial . here",
    "we create a single - ringed toroidal trap using a red - detuned laser field ( @xmath29 ) , so the atoms are light - seeking , using an lg beam with @xmath5 , in which case @xmath30 , and we hereafter drop the @xmath4 index and take @xmath31",
    ". then for each value of @xmath1 the intensity profile has a single maximum at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to produce a toroid of a fixed radius @xmath33 , we need to choose the spot size @xmath34 for each azimuthal mode such that @xmath35 furthermore , for a given @xmath1 the peak intensity at the toroid center @xmath36 may be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the peak intensity for @xmath39 @xcite . here in the expression for @xmath40",
    "we have used stirling s formula @xmath41 , and we see that the peak intensity scales as @xmath42 .    gathering the above results together , for a fixed laser power @xmath25 we may write the optical dipole potential ( eq .",
    "( [ optpot ] ) ) in the following form which is useful for comparison between different values of @xmath1 @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 being the optical dipole potential well depth for @xmath39 at the toroid radius @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath47 is negative for a laser red detuned from resonance .",
    "figure 2 shows the normalized optical dipole potential @xmath48 versus @xmath49 for various azimuthal mode indices @xmath1 , a red - detuned laser , and fixed laser power and toroid radius , i.e. fixed @xmath45 .",
    "here we see that as @xmath1 increases the toroidal trap becomes deeper and tighter , meaning that higher - order lg beams present advantages for making tight toroidal dipole traps .",
    "in this section we elucidate the ground state properties of toroidal traps using the harmonic oscillator and thomas - fermi approximations .",
    "these approximate solutions amply illustrate the key features of the problem .      setting @xmath50 for the cylindrically symmetric ground state we obtain    @xmath51    with @xmath52 the chemical potential . to obtain insight into the solutions of this equation we consider the harmonic oscillator approximation to the toroidal dipole potential ( eq .",
    "( [ uell ] ) ) trap around @xmath36 , @xmath53 where @xmath47 is negative for a red detuned laser , as assumed throughout the paper .",
    "if we furthermore employ the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite , in which the kinetic energy term is neglected in comparison to the mean field energy , then we obtain the approximate gpe @xmath54 where the effective harmonic oscillator frequencies are @xmath55 where stirling s formula was used in the last expression .",
    "equation ( [ gpeq3 ] ) has the approximate ring solution @xmath56 @xmath57 where the ring width is given by @xmath58 these solutions correspond to ring - shaped bec density profiles which are peaked at @xmath36 and have a width @xmath59 .",
    "we see that as the azimuthal mode index @xmath1 is increased with all other parameters fixed the radial harmonic oscillator frequency increases @xmath60 , and the ring width decreases @xmath61 .",
    "thus , using higher - order lg beams provides an advantage for making tight bound toroidal rings as commented earlier .",
    "the 2d thomas - fermi solution above should be applicable under the combined conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which ensure that the mean - field energy is greater than the kinetic energy , and the ring width is less than the toroid radius .",
    "the latter condition is also required for the validity of the harmonic oscillator approximation .      to explore the parameter space for the toroidal trap",
    "it is useful to introduce appropriately scaled units . for a trap of radius @xmath46",
    "we scale all lengths as @xmath64 , all energies are scaled to @xmath65 , and we introduce a dimensionless time @xmath66 . in these units the gpe becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is a dimensionless measure of the repulsive many - body interactions @xcite .",
    "we shall use the above scaled gpe in our numerical simulations of loading toroidal optical dipole traps .    turning to the thomas - fermi solution , in dimensionless units",
    "the radial harmonic oscillator frequency and the ring width become @xmath71 and the chemical potential is given by @xmath72 \\label{chempot}\\ ] ] where stirling s formula has been used .",
    "these solutions depend on the dimensionless well depth @xmath73 for @xmath39 which is given explicitly by @xmath74 and is independent of the toroid radius .    in dimensionless",
    "form the condition @xmath75 for applicability of the thomas - fermi approximation becomes @xmath76 . combining this with the condition @xmath77 yields the constraint on the number of particles @xmath78 which shows that traps using higher azimuthal mode index can hold more atoms , all other parameters being equal .",
    "to illustrate the basic scales involved in toroidal traps we consider the case of the @xmath79 nm transition of na using a laser wavelength of @xmath80 and a toroid radius of @xmath81 , these values being used throughout this paper . then using the parameter values @xmath82 w / m@xmath83 , @xmath84",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 , with @xmath25 in milli - watts . using @xmath86",
    "k , with corresponding time scale @xmath87 ms , for a given azimuthal mode index @xmath1 this potential depth translates to @xmath88 . the corresponding effective oscillator frequencies in the toroidal trap are then @xmath89 .",
    "consider therefore the case of @xmath90 so that @xmath91 . for two - dimensional becs",
    "a characteristic value for the many - body parameter is @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "then for @xmath93 and @xmath94 we have @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "this is not a particularly tight ring but tighter confinement can be achieved by increasing the azimuthal mode index .",
    "figure 3 shows the variation of the oscillator frequency @xmath97 in khz ( solid line ) , and @xmath98 in microns ( dashed line ) both versus @xmath1 for @xmath99 , and displays the advantage of using high azimuthal mode index .",
    "we note that it is difficult to produce lg modes with very high azimuthal index ( @xmath100 ) due to decreasing mode purity from holographic generation .",
    "however , other techniques exist for generating narrow annular beams , e.g. using an axicon @xcite . typically the radial spread of such beams is very small , thus they would allow one to explore the region of tight radial confinement seen for lg beams with @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "having established that lg beams can provide toroidal traps for 2d becs the issue arises of how to load atoms into the ground state of the trap . it does not seem feasible to condense directly in the toroidal trap as it does not lend itself to evaporative cooling and the laser field",
    "could lead to heating .",
    "the solution is then to load into the toroidal trap from an existing bec , e.g. a magnetic trap or sheet dipole potential trap @xcite . here",
    "we consider loading of a toroidal trap from an initial 2d ring bec , for example using a magnetic trap with a blue - detuned laser piercing its center @xcite , and also from a centrally peaked bec as is the case for conventional harmonic traps .",
    "the calculations presented here demonstrate that it is in principle possible to load toroidal traps and we use illustrative examples which highlight the issues involved .",
    "we have numerically solved the gpe ( [ gpeq4 ] ) for a variety of initial conditions with the exact optical dipole potential in eq .",
    "( [ uell ] ) .",
    "we consider the situation that for @xmath102 the bec is in the ground state of a prescribed potential which is turned off for @xmath103 and the toroidal lg trap is turned on .",
    "to model this situation we have considered a variety of initial conditions at @xmath104 and their subsequent evolution . rather than dwelling on a specific potential model for @xmath102",
    "we consider the super - gaussian initial macroscopic wave functions @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a normalization constant , @xmath107 is the width of the initial wave function , @xmath108 is the order of the super - gaussian , @xmath109 being the usual gaussian , and @xmath110 is the displacement of the density peak away from the origin : for @xmath111 we have a centrally peaked initial density , @xmath112 gives an initial ring bec with its peak at the toroid radius .",
    "as @xmath113 increases the initial condition becomes more top - hat like , representative of the broadening due to repulsive many - body effects .",
    "for the numerics presented here we set @xmath114 .",
    "we have numerically solved the gpe ( [ gpeq4 ] ) for a variety of initial conditions with the exact optical dipole potential in eq .",
    "( [ uell ] ) subject to the above initial conditions using the split - step beam propagation method @xcite . in implementing this scheme",
    "we have included absorbing boundary conditions at the edge of the numerical grid , thereby simulating losses due to radially outward going atoms .",
    "we tested that the numerical results presented were not sensitive to the placement of the absorber .",
    "thus , in our simulations the norm @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) of the macroscopic wave function is not conserved at unity . however , the norm @xmath116 is actually a measure of the fraction of initial atoms that are captured in the toroidal trap .    for most of the simulations",
    "presented we chose @xmath94 as this is characteristic of the lg beams that can be generated reliably experimentally at present @xcite .",
    "first we will discuss the loading of the toroidal optical dipole trap with a bec that is already ring shaped .",
    "although the bec has already the desired shape , this transfer from a magnetic - based ring trap to a toroidal trap is still of importance as this trap can confine multi - component condensates in different zeeman sublevels . for an initial ring",
    "bec the ground state of the toroidal trap can be excited by reasonably matching the initial and ground state wave functions .",
    "figure  [ ringbec : fig ] shows two examples of the computed dynamics for an initial ring bec formed in na with @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , and @xmath119 .",
    "for these parameters and @xmath94 the thomas - fermi theory of the last section gives a ring width of @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "[ ringbec : fig](a ) , which shows a gray - scale plot of the 2d atomic density @xmath121 versus time in ms along the horizontal axis and radius @xmath122 in microns along the vertical axis , we used @xmath94 , @xmath123 , and after a transient the density profile settles down to a steady ring of smaller width than the input .",
    "the transient involves expansion of the atoms outward from the ring and also inwards towards the origin , and the peak at the origin seen for @xmath124 ms is due to interference between the inwardly propagating circular atomic waves .",
    "the outward propagating atomic waves leads to an effective loss mechanism which allows for the damping of the initial wave function towards the ground state toroidal bec .",
    "the final ring contains @xmath125 of the initial atoms .",
    "figure [ ringbec : fig](b ) shows a gray - scale plot of the 2d atomic density for the same parameters as [ ringbec : fig](a ) except @xmath126 , for which @xmath127 , so that the input with @xmath128 is now half the expected ring width . after a considerably larger transient than in fig .",
    "[ ringbec : fig](a ) the density again settles down but now to a larger ring than the input containing about @xmath129 of the initial atoms .",
    "notice , however , that for @xmath130 ms the atomic density shows a further transient , and this is caused by weak atomic waves caught around the origin that start to leak out , as revealed by detailed examination of the data .    for these simulations",
    "we have used a rather low laser power @xmath118 , so that the toroidal trap depth is only about @xmath131 for @xmath94 .",
    "we have chosen such a loosely bound toroidal trap as an illustrative example of loading since tighter traps ( larger @xmath132 ) are generally easier to excite by suitably matched initial ring becs as the ground state and next excited state have a larger energy separation .",
    "thus the present example shows that there is considerable robustness in loading from initial ring becs , as expected intuitively",
    ". one might expect such shallow traps to be very susceptible to heating and losses induced by noise and background gas collisions .",
    "however , the heating due to position and intensity noise increase with the fourth and second power of the trap frequency @xmath133 , respectively , and heating due to background gas collisions is proportional to the square of the trap depth @xcite .",
    "therefore our shallow traps ( with low trap oscillation frequencies and small trap depth ) should be relatively immune to these detrimental effects .",
    "figure  [ peakedbec : fig ] shows representative 2d atomic density plots from simulations of loading from an initial centrally peaked ( @xmath111 ) na bec with @xmath114,@xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) , the corresponding trap depth being @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the plots are for different initial bec widths ( a ) @xmath138 with @xmath94 , ( b ) @xmath139 with @xmath94 , and ( c ) @xmath139 , with @xmath126 .",
    "case ( a ) shows very little signs of trapping in the toroid which is centered at @xmath140 , but ( b ) with an increased bec width of @xmath139 now shows substantial trapping with @xmath141 of the initial atoms trapped .",
    "what distinguishes these two case is that the initial hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , which we evaluated numerically , is @xmath142 in case ( a ) and @xmath143 for case ( b ) .",
    "the hamiltonian has three contributions , the kinetic energy which is positive , the optical dipole potential which for a red - detuned laser is negative , and the nonlinear term due to many - body repulsion which is positive . as we simulate the effects of atom losses due to outward propagating atoms using the absorbing boundary , the atom number decreases and so typically does the hamiltonian as the initial bec evolves .",
    "physically , as we consider red - detuned traps that have negative optical dipole potentials which go to zero away from the trap , atoms with energies above the trap energy of zero will tend to be lost from the toroidal trap .",
    "for case ( a ) the initial hamiltonian or energy is above the trap energy and the atoms fly above the toroidal trap under the influence of the repulsive many - body effects . indeed",
    "the initial density profile with @xmath144 overlaps the toroidal trap very little , leaving only positive contributions to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for the wider initial bec in fig .",
    "[ peakedbec : fig](b ) the initial density profile overlaps the toroidal trap giving a net hamiltonian less than the trap energy , so trapping becomes possible .",
    "we remark that the requirement that the initial hamiltonian be less than the trap energy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trapping , as there is still dependence on the initial density profile .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ peakedbec : fig](c ) is the same as in  [ peakedbec : fig](b ) except @xmath91 ( @xmath145 ) , the corresponding trap depth being @xmath146 for @xmath94 . in this case",
    "@xmath147 , well below the trap energy , but fig .",
    "[ peakedbec : fig](c ) shows that the atoms do not cleanly load into the ground state of the toroidal trap , but rather the density displays undamped oscillations on the time scale of the simulation .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is typically a feature for deeper traps .",
    "we have begun to explore methods of smoothing the loading of deeper toroidal traps , such as tapering the turn - on of the optical potential and phase - imprinting the initial bec so that it moves towards a ring .",
    "these methods do smooth the loading process and we shall report on these issues along with the effects of beam misalignments in a future publication .",
    "in this paper we have shown that laguerre - gaussian beams provide a flexible means for forming toroidal optical dipole traps in 2d atomic becs , and that the toroidal traps can be loaded from initial conditions representative of conventional magnetic traps .",
    "it remains to be seen how tight the atoms can be confined in these rings , and detailed numerical studies are underway .",
    "this work is a first step towards developing toroidal traps which shall act as mesoscopic rings for atoms for a variety of basic and applied studies @xcite .",
    "for example , once a bec is prepared in its ground state of the toroidal trap a vortex state of variable angular momentum can be excited using raman coupling ( involving a second lg beam ) to another zeeman sublevel @xcite , hence allowing for studies of ring vortices and persistent currents on a torus @xcite . also , as our toroidal trap does not involve a magnetic trap it allows for studies of multi - component becs trapped on a ring @xcite . in the limit of small number of atoms",
    "there is also the possibility of realizing a tonk s gas of impenetrable bosons on a ring @xcite , which has been predicted to exhibit dark solitons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by looking at higher - order lg modes with different radial index @xmath4 , and hence multiple concentric rings , we can create coaxial toroidal traps for the becs , hence allowing for radial tunneling between condensates .",
    "in particular , multiple rings could create a circular grating for atoms which could in principle act as the feedback mechanism for a 2d atom laser , by analogy to circular grating optical lasers @xcite . on the applied side ,",
    "once a ring bec is formed we can further pierce it with blue - detuned lasers at positions along its perimeter to form tunnel - junctions akin to superconducting links .",
    "one can then envision a range of sensors , e.g. rotation , based on the sensitivity of the tunneling current to any perturbation of the system . in principle",
    ", large rings could be made by first loading a small ring and then adiabatically expanding the lg light mode incident on the bec , hence very sensitive matter - wave sensors of inertial forces could result .",
