    "* herein b1997 ) identified photometric and spectroscopic variability at the orbit period and phased near periastron , interpreting these variations as enhanced accretion as the stellar components encounter streams of infalling material from the circumbinary disk .",
    "recently @xcite reported a mm flare in dq  tau , but interpret the flare as interacting stellar magnetospheres similar to that seen in v773  tau  a @xcite .",
    "binary systems are expected to clear inner gaps in their circumbinary disks ( out to several times the binary semi - major axis ) as material is dynamically ejected by the components @xcite .",
    "@xcite report sed evidence for such inner - disk clearings in a set of t tauri binaries .",
    "the seds in these systems show a deficit of near - ir emission relative to mid - ir flux  interpreted as a lack of the warmer inner - disk material that has been dispersed by the stars orbital motion .",
    "conversely , the dq  tau sed ( and a few others , e.g.  ak  sco @xcite , and uz  tau  e @xcite ) exhibits no such near - ir deficit , leading m1997 to conclude `` there is clearly warm material within the binary orbit . ''",
    "m1997 modeled the dq  tau sed with a modest ( 5@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 ) amount of warm ( 1000 k ) , optically - thin material in the dq  tau binary region .",
    "* herein c2001 ) supported this conclusion with ir spectroscopic detection of warm ( 1200 k ) co gas emission from dq  tau .",
    "the presence of material inside the expected dq  tau dynamical gap is unsurprising : the system shows strong accretion diagnostics .",
    "but the amount and morphology of this ` inner ' material bears on how such pms binary systems interact with and accrete material from their circumbinary reservoir , and motivates study with the highest - resolution techniques available .",
    "here we report on observations of dq  tau with the keck interferometer ( ki , * ? ? ?",
    "these observations partially resolve the dq  tau system , and allow us to model the system visual orbit based on the spectroscopic orbit by m1997 .",
    "further , we find that we must account for a static ` excess ' flux which is compact , but partially resolved in these data .",
    "we interpret this excess source with possible morphological models for the warm material postulated by m1997 and c2001 , and discuss implications on inner material and accretion in the dq  tau system .",
    "the dq  tau sed has been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and m1997 ; as it bears on our ki data analysis we summarize the sed here . figure  [ fig : sedplot ] shows a visible and near - ir sed model for the dq  tau stellar photospheres derived using photometry from @xcite and 2mass @xcite . adopting published extinction estimates ( a@xmath5 = 2.13 ; * ? ? ? * ) and photospheric parameters ( @xmath6 = 4000 k , log g = 4.0 , solar abundance ; m1997 ) , we can model photometry between 0.45 and 1 @xmath7 m ( excluding blue accretion flux and ir excess ) with a single photosphere ( the stellar components of dq  tau are nearly identical ; m1997 ) .",
    "we find the net photosphere model shown in figure  [ fig : sedplot ] , corresponding to a total stellar luminosity of 0.88 l@xmath8 for d = 140 pc , in good agreement with previous estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these estimates ignore the significant ( 0.35 @xmath9 0.15 at 0.6 @xmath7 m ) veiling reported by b1997 . an alternative model assuming uniform veiling between 0.45 and 1 @xmath7 m",
    "is also given in figure  [ fig : sedplot ] , corresponding to total stellar luminosity of 0.65 l@xmath8 .",
    "the total luminosity of the dq  tau photospheres is likely between these two extremes .",
    "dq  tau s sed exhibits strong ir excess beyond 1 @xmath7 m .",
    "m1997 modeled this excess with a power - law , and particularly argued for the presence of a cooler circumbinary disk and additional warm material within the binary orbit based on substantial excess over the stellar emission between 1  5 @xmath7 m .",
    "most significant for our purposes is the excess in @xmath10-band ( 2.2 @xmath7 m )  highlighted in fig  [ fig : sedplot ] . based on the photospheric models from above we estimate the fractional excess @xmath11 at @xmath10 over the stellar contribution to be in the range of 0.5  1.1 ( modulo intrinsic @xmath10-variability of the system ; we return to this question in   [ sec : offset ] ) .",
    "the bottom of this range agrees with similar estimates from @xcite and @xcite , while higher values result from encorporating the veiling estimate of b1997 .",
    "this sed model makes it clear our ki observations will contain flux from both the dq  tau binary components and additional material , but the exact value of the excess @xmath10-emission over stellar is uncertain to a factor of two .",

    "the dq  tau physical parameters from m1997 and putative 140 pc distance imply an apparent semi - major axis on the order of 1 mas .",
    "this apparent separation is marginally resolved in our data ( projected fringe spacing of 5.1 mas ) , and does not allow an independent solution for the binary visual orbit .",
    "therefore we have constrained our orbital modeling with parameters from m1997 ( with period slightly revised by * ? ? ?",
    "effectively we solve only for @xmath13 and the sense of rotation on the sky ( i.e.  whether @xmath14 is greater or less than 90@xmath15 ) .",
    "further , from   [ sec : sed ] it is necessary to account for the visibility contribution of dq  tau s @xmath10 excess ( even if that flux is incoherent on angular scales measured in these data ) .",

    "@xmath16 accounts for contributions from dq  tau s @xmath10 excess in our modeling .",
    "we have taken this visibility offset as static , that is invariant in time and with baseline projection angle ; this construct warrants some consideration .",
    "first we note that m1997 and b1997 reported photometric variability in dq  tau , but this was strongest in blue ( u & b ) colors and attributed to variability in accretion luminosity ; as we will argue below spectrophotometric monitoring suggests changes in the system @xmath10 flux are modest .",
    "second , the assumption of an offset that is independent of baseline projection de facto assumes that the @xmath10 excess centroid is centered ( co - axial ) on the binary center of mass / light ( for an equal - mass binary ) , and is itself axially symmetric .",
    "@xcite have modeled accretion in systems such as dq  tau , and their modeling clearly shows time - variable and non - axisymmetric structures .",
    "these time - variable features call into question our static visibility offset construct , but the degree of visibility variability will depend on the relative intensity of symmetric and non - symmetric components of the @xmath10 flux in the dq  tau excess , and the spatial frequency coverage in our interferometric data . in our last epoch ( 2007 oct 28 ; figure  [ fig : v2data ] bottom ) we specifically made the observation at periastron , and pushed the ki instrument to its maximum range in hour angle ( roughly four hours ) to test this static offset / axisymmetic emission assumption to the greatest extent possible .",
    "data from this last epoch show no significant signs of variation with hour angle , supporting the axisymmetric emission construct . given these considerations we settle on a static visibility offset to account for the @xmath10 excess because nothing more complicated is justified by our data : the binary plus static offset construct adequately model our ki data over their range of spatial frequency .",
    "the ( monochromatic ) v@xmath12 of a two - component composite scene is given by : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the visibilities of two components , @xmath11 the flux ratio ( 2 to 1 ) , and @xmath31 the phase difference between the two fringes ( e.g. @xmath31 = 2 @xmath32 @xmath33 for a typical binary source ) ; the second form assumes this phase offset is zero or the two sources are co - axial . identifying @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the dq  tau binary and the @xmath10-excess respectively , and evaluating the expression at a convenient binary phase ( i.e. periastron , where @xmath34 ) leaves : @xmath35 this allows us to estimate the net visibility of the dq  tau @xmath10-excess in terms of v@xmath36 ( table  [ tab : orbit ] ) as : @xmath37 evaluating eq .",
    "[ eq : excessvisibility ] with @xmath11 in the range of 0.5  1.1 (   [ sec : sed ] ) and @xmath16 = 0.15 ( table  [ tab : orbit ] ) yields @xmath38 = 0.77  0.85 .",
    "m1997 documents significant optical variability in dq  tau , and attributes the variability to enhanced accretion near periastron .",
    "pertinent to this discussion is the degree of @xmath10 variability in the system .",
    "dq  tau has been monitored with the cormass instrument @xcite as part of a t  tauri accretion variability program discussed in @xcite .",
    "analysis of these data suggests that @xmath10 emission during enhanced accretion is approximately 20% brighter than during a quiescent phase .",
    "this variation is small compared to the factor of two uncertainty in @xmath11 from the dq  tau photospheric uncertainty .",
    "remarkably this range for @xmath38 indicates the ki data resolve , but do not over - resolve , the @xmath10 excess , and this result is robust even incorporating the large uncertainty in @xmath11 .",
    "for instance , if the dominant @xmath10-excess came from a warm inner - edge of the circumbinary disk ( nominally at a barycentric distance of @xmath39 0.4 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the apparent inner - edge diameter would be @xmath0 5.7 mas .",
    "the @xmath40 of such a ring morphology would be @xmath0 0.1  0.2 .",
    "apparently the @xmath10 excess is dominated by emission from a region significantly more compact than the dynamically - allowed inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "our visibility measurement supports the m1997 and c2001 conclusion that there is warm material in the vicinity of the dq  tau binary , and emission from that material dominates the system s @xmath10 excess .    if we neglect @xmath10-emission from the circumbinary disk entirely ( the equilibrium temperature of material at 0.4 au is on the order of 475  k )",
    ", we can estimate the angular scale of emission from the warm material .",

    "of these three models we expect the gaussian profile most closely matches the warm material emission profile ; we note that this assumption results in a size scale ( 1.1  1.4 mas ; 0.15  0.2 au at 140 pc ) that closely matched the apparent binary separation at apastron ( @xmath0 1.5 mas ) .",

    "we have modeled our dq  tau observations based on orbital parameters from m1997 and system sed .",
    "unsurprisingly , the significant @xmath10-excess must be included in the v@xmath41 modeling .",
    "remarkably these data indicate the excess must come from a region smaller than the circumbinary disk .",
    "further , our data suggest that this excess is distributed on the physical scale of the binary orbit ( @xmath0 0.1  0.2 au ) rather than being either much smaller ( e.g.  circumstellar disks ) or much larger ( i.e.  the circumbinary disk ) than the stellar separation .    our data and modeling support the m1997 and c2001 inference that dq  tau has significant warm material in the inner orbit region ( in addition to the substantial circumbinary disk ) .",
    "binary dynamics , accretion , and wind / outflow processes work to dissipate this inner material over a few binary orbital periods . the static visibility offset that adequately models our ki data over many dq  tau orbital periods suggests the system is in quasi - equilibrium with material inflow replenishing dissipated material in the binary region .",
    "it is important to note that our present data on and modeling of this remarkable system is relatively crude .",
    "in particular the @xmath0 5 mas ki fringe spacing only partially resolves the @xmath0 1 mas dq  tau binary orbit .",
    "clearly limited spatial information leads to limitations in our dq  tau modeling , and some care in interpreting our conclusions is warranted .",
    "our construct that the @xmath10-excess morphology is axisymmetric seems the most suspect ; it runs counter to existing modeling of accreting binary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photometric / accretion brightening near periastron ( m1997 ) . however nothing more sophisticated is justified by our data  in particular the ki data from our last epoch ( 2007 oct 28 ) test the axisymmetric modeling assumption to the practical limits of ki capabilities ( in broad - band data ) .",
    "but there should be an asymmetric component to the near - ir flux at some contrast level and spatial scale in the dq  tau system .",
    "going forward it is important to probe the extent of any axisymmetry in the near - ir excess at a greater diversity of spatial scales and wavelengths to understand the distribution and flow of material in dq  tau and similar systems .",
