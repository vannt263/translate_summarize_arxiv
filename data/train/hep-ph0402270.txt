    "essential elements of fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions have been discovered in the past three decades by operating @xmath2 colliders .",
    "a coherent picture of the structure of matter has emerged , that is adequately described by the standard model(sm ) , in many of its facets at a level of very high accuracy . however , the sm does not provide a comprehensive theory of matter . neither the fundamental parameters , masses and couplings , nor the symmetry pattern can be explained .",
    "therefore , some new theories beyond the sm(new physics models ) have been studied to solve the problems of the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist new particles in the new physics models , probing these particles at future high - energy colliders can provide a direct way to test these models .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest particle yet experimentally discovered and its mass of 174 gev @xcite is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) scale .",
    "much theoretical work has been carried out in connection to the top quark and ewsb . the top - color - assisted technicolor ( tc2)@xcite model , the top seesaw model @xcite and the flavor universal tc2 model @xcite are three such examples .",
    "the tc2 model is a more realistic one , which generates the large top quark mass through a dynamical @xmath8 condensation and provides a possible dynamical mechanism for breaking electroweak symmetry . in the tc2 model , the new strong dynamics",
    "is assumed to be chiral - critically strong but spontaneously broken by tc at the scale @xmath9 1 tev and the ewsb is driven mainly by tc interaction .",
    "the extended technicolor(etc ) interaction gives the contribution to all ordinary quark and lepton masses including a very small portion of the top quark mass : @xmath10 @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the top - color interaction also makes a small contribution to the ewsb and gives rise to the main part of the top quark mass : @xmath12 .",
    "the tc2 model also predicts the existence of a cp - even scalar @xmath13 called the top - higgs and three cp - odd pseudo goldstone bosons(pgb s ) called top - pions @xmath14,@xmath15 in a few hundreds gev region . the physical particle top - pions can be regarded as a typical feature of the tc2 model .",
    "thus , the study of the possible signatures of top - pions and top - pion contribution to some processes at high- energy colliders can be regarded as a good method to test the tc2 model and further to probe the ewsb mechanism .    at the energy scale @xmath16 1 tev , the new strong dynamics",
    "is coupled preferentially to the third generation .",
    "the dynamics of a general tc2 model involves the following structure@xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 couples preferentially to the third generation(the first and the second generations ) .",
    "the @xmath19 is just strongly rescaled versions of electroweak @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is assumed strong enough to produce a large top condensate which is responsible for the main part of the top quark mass .",
    "the b - quark mass is an interesting issue , involving a combination of etc effects and instanton effects in @xmath22 .",
    "the instanton induced b - quark mass can then be estimated as @xcite : @xmath23 where we generally expect @xmath24 to @xmath25 as in qcd . in the tc2 model ,",
    "the top - color gauge bosons include the color - octet colorons @xmath26 and color - singlet extra @xmath27 gauge boson @xmath28 .",
    "these gauge bosons have very large masses which can be up to several tev .",
    "such large masses will depress the contribution to the cross sections .",
    "so , in our calculation , we can neglect the contributions of the gauge bosons .",
    "the planned linear @xmath2 colliders(lc ) with energy in the range from a few hundred gev up to several tev are under intense studies around the world .",
    "these studies are being done at the next linear collider(nlc)(usa)@xcite , the japan linear collider(jlc)(japan)@xcite and the desy tev energy superconducting linear accelerator(tesla)(europe)@xcite .",
    "one task of these high - energy @xmath2 colliders is to search for higgs particle in the sm or some new particles predicted in the models beyond the sm[such as higgs bosons @xmath29 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) and pgb s in the tc2 model ] .",
    "so , the study of some new particle production processes can provide a theoretical instruction to search for these particles experimentally .    as it is known , top - pions are the typical particles in the tc2 model .",
    "some neutral top - pion production processes have been studied in ref.@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ref.@xcite has studied a top - charm associated production process at lhc to probe the top - pion .",
    "the above studies provide us with some useful information to detect top - pion events and test the tc2 model . in this paper , we study the neutral top - pion production processes @xmath30 in the framework of the tc2 model , where @xmath31 represents @xmath32 quarks and @xmath33 leptons .",
    "our results show that the cross sections of the processes @xmath34 are very small .",
    "the largest cross section could only reach an order of magnitude @xmath35 .",
    "with such small cross sections , the neutral top - pion can be hardly detected via these processes .",
    "so , we pay attention to the processes @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these cross sections are about two orders or even three orders of magnitude larger than that of processes @xmath39 .",
    "the study in this paper is a useful addition to the previous studies .",
    "some similar processes in the context of the sm and mssm have also been studied quite extensively in the lc@xcite , tevatron and lhc@xcite .",
    "reference@xcite has investigated the production of the neutral scalar with a pair of top quarks at the hadron collider .",
    "they find that the neutral scalar may be observed at the lhc via the process @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 production mode is extremely interesting for physicists because this production mode provides a direct way to measure the yukawa couplings of the quarks with scalar particles , on the other hand , we can detect these scalar particles at lc , lhc and tevatron ii with high luminosity through these processes .",
    "the calculation of the production cross sections of the processes @xmath30 is presented in sec ii .",
    "it is noticeable that the tc2 model may have rich top - quark phenomenology since it treats the top quark differently from other quarks . the couplings of top - pions to three family fermions are nonuniversal and the top - pions have large yukawa couplings to the third generation .",
    "the yukawa interactions of top - pions to @xmath42 quarks can be written as@xcite @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 gev is the top - pion decay constant and @xmath46 gev is the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale .",

    "the largest cross sections are 1.78 fb and 4.15fb , when we take @xmath122 and @xmath117 and 1600 gev , respectively .",
    "the cross section increases with @xmath116 . with a luminosity of @xmath123yr",
    ", there are several tens or even hundreds of @xmath0 events to be produced via the process @xmath124 . for @xmath125 350 gev , the dominate decay channel of @xmath0 is @xmath126 . as has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the branching ratio br@xmath127 can reach about 60% . because there is no tree level flavor - changing neutral current in the sm , the background of @xmath128 is very clean .",
    "therefore , @xmath128 is an ideal channel to detect the neutral top - pion with small top - pion mass . for @xmath129",
    "350 gev , @xmath130 is permitted and the total width of @xmath0 increases significantly .",
    "the branching ratio of the decay channel @xmath130 is close to 100% , all other decay modes may be ignored . in this case , we should detect @xmath0 through the @xmath131 channel .",

    "in the all parameter space we consider , the cross section is larger than 2.5fb for @xmath134 gev .",
    "the same plots as fig.2 for the process @xmath135 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the contributions to the cross section come mainly from fig.1(e ) due to the resonance effect of the @xmath83 propagator . in this case , the effect of the decay width of @xmath136 should be considered .",
    "the possible decay modes of @xmath83 are @xmath137 @xmath131(if @xmath138 ) .",
    "the results show that although the coupling of @xmath139 is much smaller than the coupling of @xmath133 , the resonance effect can enhance the cross section to the level of a few fb .",
    "when @xmath134 gev , the cross section will be much smaller than that for @xmath117 gev and it hardly varies with @xmath113 .",
    "so we only draw up the plots for the case of @xmath117 gev .",
    "the plots show that the cross section is not sensitive to @xmath113 .",
    "the neutral top - pion can be more easily detected via the process @xmath38 than via the process @xmath37 with b - tagging .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath135 provides us with another useful way to search for a neutral top - pion .    for the other processes @xmath140 , the largest cross section could only be up to 0.01 fb .",
    "therefore , we could hardly detect the neutral top - pion through these processes .",
    "so we do not discuss these processes in detail .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied some neutral top - pion production processes @xmath141 at the future @xmath2 colliders in the framework of the tc2 model .",
    "we find that there are the following features for these processes : ( i)the cross sections of the processes @xmath140 are too small to detect a neutral top - pion .",
    "( ii)due to the effect of the top quark triangle loops , there exists a narrow peak in the cross section plots of the process @xmath124 . because of the resonance effect , the cross section of @xmath36 could be up to a few fb and a few tens or even hundreds of @xmath0 events can be produced , which causes the neutral top - pion to become experimentally detectable through the flavor - changing @xmath7 channel with the clean background .",
    "( iii)the cross sections of both @xmath142 and @xmath143 can reach the level of a few fb , the strong coupling @xmath144 in the process @xmath143 and the resonance effect of the @xmath136 propagator in the process @xmath142 could enhance the cross sections significantly .",
    "these two processes provide us with another way to search for a neutral top - pion .",

    "<S> , the top - pion events can possibly be detected at the planned high luminosity @xmath2 colliders . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such neutral top - pion production processes provide a useful way to detect a neutral top - pion and test the tc2 model directly . </S>"
