    "a generic homotopy of a knotted circle in a 3-manifold @xmath1 traces out a properly immersed annulus in the product @xmath2 of @xmath1 with an interval .",
    "knot invariants can be extracted from homotopy invariants of such a singular concordance by factoring out the contributions from self - homotopies of knots .",
    "for instance , the ( relative ) self - linking invariants of @xcite are determined by the self - intersection numbers of immersed annuli in the group ring @xmath3 $ ] , and are characterized as the complete obstruction to finding an `` improved '' singular concordance in the sense that all of its singularities are paired by whitney disks . in this",
    "setting , we will describe how a generalization of the intersection invariant of @xcite can be used to define `` higher order '' linking invariants which give obstructions to building a `` higher order whitney tower '' , meaning that intersections between annuli and the interiors of previously existing whitney disks can be paired by a second layer of whitney disks . as a corollary , we can in many cases determine which links can cobound a collection @xmath4 of properly immersed annuli in @xmath2 such that @xmath4 is homotopic ( rel boundary ) to an embedding after stabilization by taking connected sums with copies of @xmath0 . if one end of such a _ stable concordance _ is the unlink then it can be capped off to form _ stable slice _ disks",
    ".    besides detecting many infinite families of non - concordant knots and links , the invariants defined here will give :    * a complete characterization of links in orientable 3-manifolds which are stably slice . * a classification of stable concordance for many links of null - homotopic knots in orientable 3-manifolds with torsion - free fundamental group . * a classification of stable concordance for knots in products @xmath5 of an orientable surface with the circle .",
    "the approach taken here fits into the developing theory of whitney towers in 4-manifolds ( @xcite ) , but of equal interest in the current setting is how the topology of a 3-manifold interacts with its knot theory .",
    "this interaction is reflected in the indeterminacies in the invariants coming from self - homotopies of knots , which can be studied using classical 3-dimensional structure theorems , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these indeterminacies depend only on lower order invariants which can often be easily computed in the 3-manifold .",
    "the algebraic linking invariants of @xcite are defined for all knots in a large family of orientable 3-manifolds . for a link of null - homotopic knots the invariants reduce to the usual equivariant linking form , but for knots in non - trivial ( free ) homotopy classes these invariants are _ relative _ invariants , which compare homotopic knots to a chosen `` base knot '' .",
    "one of the main observations of @xcite is that although such a choice of base knot is not canonical , there are certain preferred knots which `` maximize '' the geometric characterization of the invariants by `` minimizing '' the indeterminacies .",
    "these knots are called _ spherical knots _ in @xcite because all their corresponding indeterminacies come from intersections between the knots and 2-spheres in the 3-manifold .",
    "( in general , knot self - homotopies project to tori in @xmath1 which can contribute indeterminacies even when @xmath1 is irreducible . )",
    "it is only with respect to spherical knots that the invariants of @xcite classify _ order 1 whitney concordance _ ,",
    "i.e. give the complete obstruction to the existence of a singular concordance having all double points paired by whitney disks .",
    "in the present paper we take a more streamlined approach by directly prescribing the analogous `` indeterminacy - minimizing '' base knots ( and links ) which give the desired classification of stable concordance and equivalent characterizations in terms of whitney towers .",
    "note that we now have many more equivalence classes to examine ; for instance in a non - simply - connected 3-manifold there are infinitely many order 1 whitney concordance classes of null - homotopic knots .",
    "we will describe how to choose appropriate knots so that the resulting indeterminacies only depend on the given equivalence class .",
    "these indeterminacies will be computable in terms of intersections between knots and 2-spheres , disks , and annuli in @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of this introduction will introduce enough terminology to state the main results , leaving detailed definitions and proofs to the body of the paper .",
    "the reader should note that there are some essentially cosmetic differences in notation between this paper and the closely related papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the notation used here is chosen to fit with the more recent literature on whitney towers , and clarifications will be made as terminology is introduced . while a familiarity with @xcite and @xcite is certainly helpful , the present paper is to a large extent self - contained , including sketches of much relevant background material . in particular ,",
