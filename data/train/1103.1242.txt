    "@xcite was a european southern observatory ( eso ) large programme which obtained high - resolution spectroscopy of about 700 massive stars from seven cluster fields in the milky way and magellanic clouds , with the primary objective to study the effects of metallicity on stellar evolution .",
    "some of the key results include : a precise quantification of the theoretically predicted metallicity dependence of the winds from o - type stars ( mokiem et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; determinations of chemical abundances in the clouds ( hunter et al .",

    "the tarantula nebula ( also known as 30  doradus ) is an immense star - forming region at the eastern end of the stellar bar in the lmc , and the most active starburst region in the local group . a significant amount of the total energy emitted by the nebula comes from r136 , a compact cluster located at its core , thought to host some of the most massive stars known ( crowther et al .",
    "@xcite ) . due to its proximity , its relatively low reddening , and the favorable inclination of the lmc ,",
    "the tarantula nebula is one of the best laboratories to study the formation and evolution of massive stars .",

    "the models also predict that stars with initial masses larger than 15  , will either slow down ( at z= ) or remain at almost constant rotation rates ( at z lower than ) throughout their main - sequence ( ms ) lifetimes , suggesting that massive o - type stars in the magellanic clouds should rotate faster than their galactic counterparts .",
    "while some of these predictions have been confirmed by observations , others are not ( e.g. , penny and gies @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the flames tarantula survey aims to investigate the effects of rotation at the high - mass end of the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram and , in particular , to test the model predictions with regarding to rotational mixing of core - processed material to the stellar surface .",

    "the multi - epoch observation strategy adopted for the survey allows us to obtain clear signatures of short - period binarity in the majority of the targets , while also providing information for some of the long - period binaries as well , this will put robust constraints on the total binary fraction in  30 dor .",
