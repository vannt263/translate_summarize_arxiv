    "we introduce in this work a one parameter family of diffusion processes that model physical phenomena with a finite speed of propagation , collectively called * kinetic brownian motion*. the need for such models in applied sciences is real , and ranges from molecular biology , to industrial laser applications , see for instance the works @xcite and the references therein . as a first step in this direction ,",
    "we consider here what may be one of the simplest example of such a process and provide a detailed study of its behaviour in a fairly general geometric setting . in the euclidean space @xmath5 , kinetic brownian motion with parameter @xmath2 , is simply described as a @xmath4 random path @xmath6 with brownian velocity on the unit sphere , run at speed @xmath7 , so @xmath8 for some brownian motion @xmath9 on the unit sphere of @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig.first ]        in contrast with langevin process , whose @xmath5-valued part can go arbitrarily far in an arbitrarily small amount of time , kinetic brownian motion provides a bona fide model of random process with finite speed .",
    "its definition on a riemannian manifold follows the intuition provided by its @xmath5 version , and can be obtained by rolling on @xmath3 without slipping its euclidean counterpart .",
    "figure 2 below illustrates the dynamics of kinetic brownian motion on the torus , as time goes on .",
    "[ fig.torus ]     we devote most of our efforts in this work in relating the large noise and large time behaviour of the process to the geometry of the manifold . on the one hand",
    ", we show that kinetic brownian motion interpolates between geodesic and brownian motions , as @xmath2 ranges from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , leading to a kind of homogenization .",
    "our use of rough paths theory for proving that fact may be of independent interest .",
    "we first prove the interpolation property in the model space @xmath5 , and strengthen the associated convergence results into some rough paths convergence results .",
    "the twist here is that once the latter result is proved , the fact that kinetic brownian motion can be constructed from the rough path lift of kinetic brownian motion in @xmath5 by solving a rough differential equation , together with the continuity of the it map , in rough path topology , provides a clean justification of the homogenization phenomenon .",
    "this result strongly echoes bismut s corresponding result for his hypoelliptic laplacian @xcite which , roughly speaking , corresponds in its simplest features to replacing the brownian velocity on the sphere by a velocity process given by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process . as a matter of fact",
    ", our method for proving the above mentionned homogenization result can also be used to recover the corresponding result for bismut s hypoelliptic diffusion .    on the other hand",
    ", we are able to give a complete description of the poisson boundary of kinetic brownian motion when the underlying riemannian manifold is sufficiently symmetric and @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "this is far from obvious as kinetic brownian motion is a hypoelliptic diffusion which is non - subelliptic .",
    "we take advantage in this task of the powerful _ dvissage method _ that was introduced recently in @xcite as a tool for the analysis of the poisson boundaries of markov processes on manifolds .",
    "its typical range of application involves a diffusion @xmath12 that admits a subdiffusion @xmath13 whose poisson boundary is known .",
    "if the remaining piece @xmath14 of @xmath15 converges to some random variable @xmath16 , the dvissage method provides conditions that garantee that the invariant sigma field of @xmath12 will be generated by @xmath16 together with the invariant sigma field of @xmath6 , see the end of section [ sec.kasymp ] where the main results of @xcite are recalled . in the present situation , and somewhat like brownian motion on model spaces , the poisson boundary of kinetic brownian motion is described by the asymptotic direction in which the process goes to infinity .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that depending on the geometry , kinetic brownian motion may have a trivial poisson boundary while brownian motion will have a non - trivial poisson boundary .",
    "kinetic brownian motion is the riemannian analogue of a class of diffusion processes on lorentzian manifolds that was introduced by franchi and le jan in @xcite , as a generalization to a curved setting of a process introduced by dudley @xcite in minkowski spacetime .",
    "these processes model the motion in spacetime of a massive object subject to brownian fluctuations of its velocity . despite their formal similarities , the causal structure of spacetime makes relativistic diffusions very different from kinetic brownian motion , as the reader will find out by reading the litterature on the subject , such as @xcite , for instance .    we have organized the article as follows .",
    "kinetic brownian motion on a given riemannian manifold @xmath17 is introduced formally in section [ sectiondefnkbm ] below . like its elementary @xmath5-valued version ,",
    "it lives in the unit tangent bundle of @xmath3 , and it has almost surely an infinite lifetime if the manifold is geodesically complete .",
    "section [ sectioninterpolation ] is dedicated to proving that the manifold - valued part of a time rescaled version of kinetic brownian motion converges weakly to brownian motion as the intensity of the noise , quantified by @xmath7 , increases indefinitely , if the manifold is stochastically complete .",
    "this is the main content of theorem [ thminterpolationgeodbm ] , which is proved using rough paths theory .",
    "the necessary material on this subject is recalled , so the reader can follow the proof without preliminary knowledge about rough paths .",
    "section [ sectionasymptotics ] provides a thourough description of the asymptotic behaviour of kinetic brownian motion on a rotationnaly invariant manifold , through the identification of its poisson boundary in a generic setting .",

    "the following direct dynamical definition in terms of stochastic differential equation provides another description of the dynamics of kinetic brownian motion which we adopt as a definition .",

    "the readers acquainted with the litterature on relativistic diffusions will recognize in equation the direct riemannian analogue of the stochastic differential equation defining relativistic diffusions in a lorentzian setting . despite this formal similarity , the two families of processes have very different behaviours . as a trivial hint that the two situations may differ radically ,",
