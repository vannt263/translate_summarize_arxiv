    "the determination of the phase structure and the critical behavior of strongly interacting matter is one of the major goals addressed theoretically in studies of qcd at finite temperature @xmath0 and quark chemical potential @xmath1 and experimentally in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "one of the fundamental predictions of qcd , is the existence of a boundary line in the @xmath2-plane that separates the confined , chirally broken hadronic phase from the deconfined chirally symmetric quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a phase boundary was recently established by first - principle calculations in lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) @xcite . for vanishing @xmath1 and for two massless flavors ,",
    "the chiral transition in the presence of an axial anomaly was argued @xcite to be second - order and in the universality class of the @xmath3-spin model . for finite quark masses , due to the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry ,",
    "the second - order transition is most likely replaced by a rapid crossover .",
    "moreover , arguments based on effective models @xcite indicate that at large @xmath1 and moderate temperatures the transition along the phase boundary is first - order .",
    "the different nature of the transition at high and low @xmath1 suggests that the qcd phase diagram exhibits at least one critical endpoint ( cep ) , where the first - order phase transition line ends in a second - order critical point , followed by a crossover region @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the static critical properties of the second - order chiral endpoint are governed by the universality class of the 3d ising model @xcite .",
    "the universal properties of the phase diagram have recently been studied extensively in an effective theory within the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach , e.g.  @xcite .    although there is still no direct proof for the existence of the cep in the qcd phase diagram , many phenomenological models predict such a point . however , its location is still strongly model dependent @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd simulations also provide indications for a possible cep in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior and the position of the cep can be identified by means of observables sensitive to the singular part of the free energy .",
    "of particular interest in this context are observables which reflect the fluctuations of conserved charges @xcite . for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "both baryon number and charge density fluctuations diverge at the cep @xcite , independently of the value of the quark mass .",
    "however , a similar divergence is expected also at a first - order phase transition in non  equilibrium situations , where the spinodal instabilities are reached @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic expansion of an ideal fluid follows trajectories of constant entropy , the so called isentropes . due to baryon - number conservation",
    ", such trajectories correspond to contours of constant entropy per baryon @xmath4 in the temperature  chemical potential plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that an expanding system , which follows an isentropic trajectory crossing a first - order phase transition between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronic phase , is focused towards the cep , if @xmath4 , at a given point @xmath5 on the phase boundary , is larger in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this implies that a larger range of initial conditions will end up in the vicinity of the cep .",
    "recently it was argued that the cep acts as an attractor for isentropic trajectories also on the crossover side , i.e. , for values of the chemical potential @xmath1 smaller than the value at the endpoint  @xcite .",
    "this feature could potentially be used to experimentally verify the existence of the cep in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "we note that the relevance of the isentropic trajectories for relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions rest on the assumption that ideal hydrodynamics provides a good approximation to the true expansion dynamics and hence that dissipative effects can be neglected .",
    "indeed , recent analyses of relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) data , show that the qgp , created in nucleus - nucleus collisions , behaves as an almost ideal fluid with a very small @xmath6 , the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xcite this implies , that dissipative processes in the qgp are strongly suppressed , leading to an essentially isentropic expansion towards the phase boundary @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case at the cep  @xcite where dynamical scaling implies that both , the shear and bulk viscosities , diverge .",
    "hence , close to the cep the expansion is most likely not isentropic and consequently the relevance of isentropic trajectories is questionable . closely related to this issue is the critical slowing down of long - wavelength fluctuations close to a second - order phase transition , which implies that the equilibration time of such a system diverges at the critical endpoint .",
    "it follows that as the cep is approached , it becomes increasingly unlikely that an expanding system remains in equilibrium , i.e. , expands isentropically .",
    "however , let us for the moment ignore this problem , and assume that the expansion of the system is sufficiently slow , so that local thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained everywhere .    under this assumption",
    ", the trajectory of the fireball produced in a nucleus - nucleus collision follows an isentropic trajectory .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath4 is a function of the collision energy .",
    "thus , in such a system , the isentropes in the @xmath2-plane encode important information on the expansion dynamics .",
    "consequently , possible modifications of the isentropes near the cep influences the evolution of the fireball in a characteristic way , which could provide an experimental signature for the existence of the endpoint .",
    "the search for the cep is one of the objectives of planned nucleus - nucleus collision experiments at rhic / bnl  @xcite and of future experiments at fair / gsi  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the properties of isentropic trajectories near the cep within an effective chiral theory .",
    "we examine the model dependence of the focusing on the crossover side of the cep @xcite both within the mean - field approach and in a functional renormalization group ( frg ) analysis , where fluctuations and nonperturbative effects are properly accounted for .",
    "the frg method has been successfully employed to describe a broad range of critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "consequently , this method is ideally suited for exploring the effect of fluctuations on the isentropic trajectories .",
    "note that , due to the lack of gluonic degrees of freedom in the model , the entropy density is much below that of qcd matter at the same temperature and chemical potential . nevertheless ,",
    "since the model is most likely in the universality class of two flavor qcd , it can provide guidance on universal properties like e.g. critical exponents and the conjectured focusing of the isentropes towards the cep .",

    "the parameters of the model were in both cases chosen so as to reproduce the vacuum physics discussed in section[sec : frg ] .",
    "we note that the position of the cep is shifted to smaller temperature and larger values of the chemical potential , namely from @xmath111 to @xmath112 mev , when the vacuum contribution is included .",
    "furthermore , the crossover temperature at @xmath113 is increased from approximately 150 to almost 210 mev , while the critical chemical potential at @xmath114 is changed by less than 10 % .",
    "our results also show that the kink in the isentropic trajectories found at the phase boundary in the calculation , where the vacuum contribution is neglected , is to a large extent an artifact of the approximation .",
    "the thermal part of ( [ quark ] ) yields a term of the form @xmath115 .",
    "with such a term in the effective potential , the phase transition in the chiral limit is first order for all densities , from @xmath113 and @xmath116 mev to @xmath114 and @xmath117 mev  @xcite , as recently found in . due to the non - zero latent heat ,",
    "the isentropic trajectories are discontinuous at the phase boundary in the @xmath118 plane .",
    "when a sufficiently strong explicit symmetry breaking term is introduced , the first order transition is smoothened into a crossover and the discontinuity in the isentropes shows up as kinks at the phase boundary .",
    "however , when the vacuum term is included , the logarithmic term is cancelled and the transition in the chiral limit is second order in flavor @xmath18 . consequently , in the chiral limit the isentropes are continuous and when the explicit symmetry breaking term is turned on the isentropic trajectories remain smooth , as seen in .",
    "these considerations offer a plausible explanation for the different behavior of the isentropes near the phase boundary in the flavor @xmath18 versions of the quark - meson and nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) ) models found in . in the quark - meson model",
    "the vacuum term was dropped , while in the njl model it must be included , since the model otherwise does not yield a state with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "consequently , one expects a kink at the transition in the quark - meson model and smooth isentropes in the njl model , in agreement with the results of .",
    "we conclude that the strong kink structure in the crossover region , which is obtained by neglecting the quark vacuum loop , is unphysical .",
    "in two recent papers , the isentropes have been computed in effective chiral models including the coupling to the polyakov loop in the mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "also in this case , the singular term cancels between the thermal and vacuum contributions .",
    "hence , one expects a kink in the quark - meson model with polyakov loop and smooth trajectories in the polyakov ",
    "njl ( pnjl ) model .",
    "this is confirmed on a qualitative level by the calculation of and similar trajectories have been obtained in the flavor @xmath119 version of the pnjl model in .",
    "the cause of a less pronounced structure found in the isentropes obtained in the pnjl model as the cep is approached , remains unclear .",
    "a possible connection with the first order transition in the chiral limit of the flavor @xmath119 model @xcite is uncertain , since similar trajectories are obtained in the two flavor pnjl model , where in the same limit the transition is second order  @xcite .    at the first - order transition to the broken symmetry phase",
    ", the isentropes are deflected to larger @xmath1 and smaller @xmath0 , away from the cep , because the entropy per baryon in the co - existence region is , in chiral effective models lacking gluonic degrees of freedom , smaller in the symmetric phase .",
    "this may be different if the chiral and deconfinement transitions coincide at finite @xmath1 , since in qcd the gluons , are expected to contribute a major part of the entropy per baryon .",
    "however , if the so called quarkyonic phase  @xcite is realized , the isentropes at the first - order transition from hadronic to quarkyonic matter may be similar to those found in the quark - meson model .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the influence of fluctuations on the isentropic trajectories at the chiral transition and in particular at the critical endpoint of qcd is of high current interest  @xcite .",
    "we address this problem by comparing the isentropic trajectories obtained using the frg approach with those obtained in the mf approximation in the preceding section .    using the thermodynamic potentials obtained in the frg approach , we determine the phase diagram of the model @xcite .",
    "the crossover line corresponds to a maximum of the chiral susceptibility . in",
    "we show the resulting phase diagram together with the corresponding isentropes . as in the mf approach",
    ", the phase diagram has a generic structure and exhibits a critical endpoint , which separates the first - order phase transition from the rapid crossover . at the cep ,",
    "the transition is of second - order and belongs to the universality class of the ising model in three dimensions .",
    "a comparison with the mf results shows that the frg phase diagram is very similar to that obtained in the mean - field calculation with the vacuum term included . in particular , the position of the critical endpoint , the crossover temperature at @xmath113 and the critical chemical potential at @xmath114 are almost identical .",
    "thus , for the quark - meson model , the effect of fluctuations on the phase diagram are fairly small , once the fermion vacuum term is taken into account . with our choice of model parameters",
    "the frg approach yields approximately @xmath120 mev within the grid method ( frg@xmath121 ) , while using the taylor expansion method ( frg@xmath122 ) we find @xmath123 mev , as shown in .",
    "thus , the location of the cep is not only model dependent  @xcite , but also depends on the way the dynamics is implemented in the renormalization group flow equation .",
    "the two approaches differ in the treatment of higher order , irrelevant operators .",
    "this does not affect universal quantities , like critical exponents , but it can affect non - universal quantities , like the location of the critical endpoint .    a shift of the cep to larger values of the chemical potential and smaller temperatures",
    "was also found in the proper - time renormalization group approach relative to the mean - field solution in . in view of our results , it is likely that a major part of this shift is due to the fermion vacuum term , which was not included in the mean - field approximation .",
    "we also show the isentropic trajectories in the ( @xmath124)-plane , obtained in the frg@xmath122   and in the frg@xmath121   approaches .",
    "the isentropes show a smooth behavior everywhere , and agree qualitatively with the mean - field trajectories shown in , i.e. , those obtained with the vacuum term .",
    "it is reassuring that the frg@xmath122   and the frg@xmath121   methods lead to a very similar isentropic trajectories .",
    "some deviations at large @xmath1 , seen in fig .  [ fig : isentropes_rg ] , indicate limitations of the taylor expansion method due to the truncation of the series ( [ eq : taylor ] ) at third order .",
    "recent lgt results @xcite on the isentropic trajectories near the qcd crossover line show qualitatively a very similar smooth behavior as obtained in our model with the frg approach and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isentropes_rg ] and [ fig : isentropes_mfd ] .",
    "a comparison of the frg and mf results shows no qualitative change of the isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the cep .",
    "in particular , the isentropes remain smooth also when the effect of long - wavelength fluctuations is consistently included and show no sign of focusing towards the cep .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : blowupcep ] , which shows a blow - up of the frg isentropes in the vicinity of the cep .",

    "the point is that the entropy and the baryon density are both obtained as first derivatives of the thermodynamic potential @xmath127 , which remain finite at the cep , since only second- and higher - order derivatives diverge .",
    "consequently , the singular part of the entropy per baryon does not diverge at the cep and hence is not guaranteed to dominate over the regular background contribution .",
    "it follows that the isentropic trajectories are not universal , since they depend on the relative strength of the universal singular part and the non - universal background . in other words , the characteristic shape of the isentropes in the vicinity of the cep can vary from model to model , even though they belong to the same universality class .",

    "@xcite yields focusing of the isentropes towards the cep because the singular part of the thermodynamic potential is chosen by hand to be very large . in chiral models , where the critical region around the cep and around the @xmath3 transition line is small @xcite , and consequently the relative strength of the singular part of @xmath127 is small , it is unlikely that the focusing effect of the isentropic trajectories reported in @xcite can be observed .",

    "the cep is indicated as a black point at the right edge of the figure.,height=309 ]    for completeness we note that the fact that this effect is not universal does not exclude the possibility that in qcd the relative strength of the singular part is large .",

    "however , then a detailed study of the equilibration of long - range fluctuations in an expanding system , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite is needed in order to decide whether the isentropic trajectories are relevant or not , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the isentropic trajectories ( contours of fixed entropy per baryon ) in the qcd phase diagram describe possible paths of the hydrodynamic evolution of a thermal medium created in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "we investigated the behavior of the isentropic trajectories within the chiral quark - meson model for two - quark flavors .",
    "the thermodynamics was formulated using functional renormalization group ( frg ) techniques and the results were compared with two variants of the mean - field ( mf ) approximation , one neglecting and the other one including the fermion vacuum term .",
    "our studies of the isentropic trajectories near the chiral phase transition were motivated by recent findings that the chiral critical endpoint ( cep ) acts as an attractor for the isentropes , leading to a focusing towards the cep @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the focusing effect would have important phenomenological consequences for nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the mf and the frg results for the isentropes show that the kink structure in the transition region , observed in some mf calculations , is washed out when the fermion vacuum contribution is properly included .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the fact that the entropy density and the baryon - number density rise rapidly near the crossover transition and also as the cep is approached , the isentropes around the cep remain very smooth .",
    "these results raise doubts concerning the focusing of isentropes and its phenomenological consequences .",
    "although , as already mentioned , the isentropic trajectories of our model differ from those of qcd , the singular part of the thermodynamic potential near the cep is universal .",
    "our results show that in the quark - meson model the singular contribution to the entropy per baryon near the cep is subdominant and hence that the conjectured focusing of the isentropic trajectories towards the cep is not universal .",
    "however , the possibility still remains that in some systems of the same universality class focusing may appear , if accidentally close to the cep the singular term dominates .",
    "thus , we conclude that the existence of such an effect in qcd matter is unlikely but not completely excluded .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with jochen wambach and vladimir skokov .",
