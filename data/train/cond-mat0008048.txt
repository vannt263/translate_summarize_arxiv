    "the quasiparticle excitations of the @xmath0-wave high temperature superconductors have been subjected to intense scrutiny in the past few years",
    ". an especially important test of our understanding of the underlying physics is whether quasiparticle relaxation processes measured by different experimental probes can be reconciled with each other .",
    "a striking dichotomy appears to have emerged recently in such a context .",
    "photoemission experiments  @xcite indicate that the nodal quasiparticles have very short lifetimes in the superconducting state , with their spectral functions having linewidths of order @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , transport experiments , especially measurements of the thermal conductivity , when interpreted in a simple quasiparticle model , indicate far larger quasiparticle lifetimes in the superconductor  @xcite .    motivated primarily by the photoemission experiments  @xcite , we recently proposed a scenario  @xcite in which the large linewidths in the fermion spectral functions are explained by fluctuations near a quantum critical point between the @xmath0 superconductor and some other superconducting state @xmath3 ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) . in this paper",
    "we will review and extend earlier arguments which classify various possibilities for the state @xmath3 .",
    "we will provide the details of a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis which shows that only a small number of the candidates for @xmath3 are associated with a rg fixed point which describes a second - order phase boundary between @xmath3 and the @xmath0 superconductor that can be generically crossed by varying a single parameter @xmath4 ; we will identify the subset of these fixed points which lead to fermion spectral linewidths of order @xmath2 .",
    "we will also initiate a discussion of the transport properties of these fixed points , and argue that they offer attractive possibilities for explaining the transport experiments as well .",
    "-wave superconductor close to a quantum - critical point .",
    "superconductivity is present for @xmath5 .",
    "the long - range order associated with the state @xmath3 vanishes for @xmath6 , but fluctuations of this order provide anomalous damping of the nodal quasiparticles in the quantum - critical region .",
    "the tuning parameter @xmath4 is some coupling constant in the hamiltonian , with the suitable choice depending upon the identity of the state @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible , although not necessary , that increasing @xmath4 corresponds to increasing doping concentration , @xmath7 .",
    "the critical point @xmath8 is not required to be in the experimentally accessible parameter regime , just not too far from the @xmath0 superconductor .",
    ", width=288 ]    we begin with a brief review of studies of quantum phase transitions in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the subject was initiated in the work of chakravarty _",
    "et al._@xcite , who presented a field - theoretic study of the destruction of nel order in insulating antiferromagnets , but focused mainly on thermal fluctuations above a nel ordered state .",
    "subsequent work examined the nature of the paramagnetic ground state in the insulator  @xcite , and of its quantum - critical point to the nel state  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was proposed  @xcite that destroying the nel order by adding a finite density of mobile charge carriers also led a quantum - critical point in the same universality class as in an insulating antiferromagnet , with dynamic critical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "this scenario had strong consequences for magnetic experiments , and for the manner in which a spin ` pseudo - gap ' would develop as @xmath1 was lowered , and these appear to be consistent with observations : crossovers in nmr relaxation rates  @xcite , uniform susceptibility  @xcite , and dynamic neutron scattering  @xcite all indicate that @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , a further consequence  @xcite of such a scenario was that the paramagnetic state should have a stable @xmath10 ` resonant ' spin excitation near the antiferromagnetic wavevector , and this is also borne out by numerous neutron scattering studies  @xcite .    if we accept that the mobile charge carriers have a superconducting ground state ( in particular , a @xmath11-wave superconductor ) , then the arguments for the common universality of the magnetic quantum critical point in insulating and doped antiferromagnets can be sharpened . for both cases ,",
    "it is clear that the order parameter is a 3-component real field , @xmath12 , which measures the amplitude of the local antiferromagnetic order . in the paramagnetic state",
    ", @xmath12 will fluctuate about @xmath13 , and indeed , the triplet ` resonance ' modes just mentioned are the 3 normal mode oscillations of @xmath12 .",
    "the transition to the state with magnetic long - range order ( we assume that the charge sector is superconducting on both sides of the transition ) is described by the condensation of @xmath12 , and the theory for the quantum - critical point will depend upon whether the @xmath12 couple efficiently to other low - energy excitations , not directly associated with the magnetic transition . in a @xmath11-wave superconductor , the important candidates for these low energy excitations are the fermionic @xmath14 bogoliubov quasiparticles ( one can also consider fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter , but we will argue below that such a coupling can be safely neglected ) .",
    "momentum conservation now plays a key role : fluctuations of @xmath12 occur primarily at a finite wavevector @xmath15 ( in the present situation , this is the wavevector at which the magnetic order appears ) , and the fermions will be scattered by this the wavevector .",
    "if @xmath15 does not equal the separation between two nodal points of the @xmath11-wave superconductor [ the nodes are the locations in the brillouin zone of gapless fermionic excitations , and they are at @xmath16 with @xmath17 at optimal doping ] , then it is not difficult to show that the fermion scattering serves mainly to renormalize the parameters in the effective low energy action for the @xmath12 , and does not lead to any disruptive low energy damping  @xcite . in such a situation , there is no fundamental difference between the magnetic fluctuations in a superconductor and an insulating paramagnet , and both cases have the same theory for the quantum critical point to the onset of long - range magnetic order .",
    "conversely , if @xmath18 , the coupling to the fermionic quasiparticles is important , and a new theory obtains : such a theory was discussed by balents _",
    "et al._@xcite    in this paper we will focus on the fermionic quasiparticles rather than the magnetic excitations .",
    "we are interested in damping mechanisms for the fermions and associated possibilities for the state @xmath3 in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the above discussion on magnetic properties suggests a natural possibility for @xmath3 : a state with co - existing magnetic and superconducting order .",
    "however , it should also be clear from the discussion above that strong damping of the fermionic quasiparticles requires @xmath19 . for the current experimental values ,",
    "this condition is far from being satisfied , and so the magnetic ordering transition is just as in an insulator .",
    "this also means that the magnetic quantum critical point is not currently a favorable candidate for the quantum critical point in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we are therefore led to a search for other possibilities , and this paper will describe the results of such a search .",
    "the new cases we will consider do not have magnetic order parameters , and so we are envisaging two distinct quantum critical points near the @xmath11-wave superconductor : one involving the magnetic order parameter which is already known to occur with decreasing doping ( and which , as discussed above , is in accord with numerous magnetic experiments ) , and another one associated with the state @xmath3 which may or may not be present along the experimentally accessible parameter regime . for completeness , we will also discuss the magnetic case with @xmath20 in section  [ afm ] : this is the only case which envisages a single quantum phase transition to explain both the magnetic experiments and the fermion damping .    in section  [ rg ]",
    ", we present the details of a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis which searches for candidate fixed points describing the quantum phase transition between @xmath3 and the @xmath11-wave superconductor : among the many a priori possibilities , only a few stable fixed points are found .",
    "the structure of the @xmath21 single fermion green s functions near these fixed points is discussed in section  [ single ] : these results can be compared with photoemission experiments .",
    "spin , thermal , and charge transport properties of all the fixed points are subsequently considered in section  [ trans ] ; a significant result is that the thermal conductivity of the quantum field theories describing the vicinities of these fixed points is infinite in the scaling limit .",
    "let us assume that the order parameter associated with @xmath3 carries total momentum @xmath15 .",
    "we have argued @xcite above that its coupling to the fermions can be relevant only if a nesting condition is satisfied : order parameter fluctuations will scatter fermions by a momentum @xmath15 , and such scattering events are important only if they occur between low energy fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the wavevector @xmath15 ( or an integer multiple of @xmath15 ) must equal the separation between two nodal points .",
    "if such a condition is not satisfied , then , as noted above , fermion scattering events can be treated as virtual processes which modify the coupling constants in the effective action , but do not lead to a fundamental change in the form of the low energy theory .",
    "three natural possibilities can satisfy the nesting condition  @xcite : @xmath15 = 0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "we will consider these possibilities in turn in the following subsections .",
    "of these , the first condition can be naturally satisfied for a range of parameter values , while the last two require fine - tuning unless , for some reason , there is a mode - locking between the values of @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will assume that the @xmath26 order parameter is a spin - singlet fermion bilinear ( spin triplet condensation at @xmath27 would imply ferromagnetic correlations which are unlikely to be present , while order parameters involving higher - order fermion correlations are not expected to have a relevant coupling to the fermions  @xcite ) .",
    "simple group theoretic arguments @xcite permit a complete classification of such order parameters .",
    "the order parameter for @xmath3 must be built out of the following correlators ( @xmath28 annihilates an electron with momentum @xmath29 and spin @xmath30 ) @xmath31 e^{i \\varphi } , \\label{orders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the background @xmath0 pairing which is assumed to be non - zero on both sides of the transition , @xmath33 is the overall phase of the superconducting order , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 contain the possible order parameters for the state @xmath3 corresponding to condensation in the particle - hole ( or excitonic ) channel or additional particle - particle pairing respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath33 has the usual charge 2 transformation under the electromagnetic gauge transformation , and so gradients of @xmath33 measure flow of physical electrical current ; because of the non - zero superfluid density associated with @xmath32 , @xmath33 fluctuations remain non - critical and we will show that they can be neglected .",
    "it follows that the order parameter @xmath35 , which is in general a complex number , carries no electrical charge .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 is also neutral but must be real .    to classify the order parameters for @xmath3 , we expand @xmath34 and @xmath35 in terms of the basis functions of the irreducible representation of the tetragonal point group @xmath36 .",
    "this group has 4 one - dimensional representations , which we label as ( basis functions in parentheses ) @xmath37 ( 1 ) , @xmath0 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , and one 2-dimensional representation @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "an analysis of all excitonic order and additional pairings ( both real and imaginary ) in these functions has been carried out  @xcite , and it was found that 7 inequivalent order parameters are allowed for @xmath3 . of these , the first 6 ( a - f ) involve a one - dimensional representation of @xmath36 , and so the order parameter is ising - like and represented by a real field @xmath45 , while the 7th ( g ) involves the 2-dimensional representation and 2 real fields @xmath46 .",

    "knowledge of the order parameters in ( [ ordersa ] ) and simple symmetry considerations allow us to write down the quantum field theories for the transition between the @xmath0 superconductor and @xmath3 .",

    "this section is based on ideas of t.  senthil ( unpublished ) in a different context .",
    "the lorentz invariance of @xmath192 implies the existence of a energy - momentum 3-tensor @xmath230 which is conserved , @xmath231 , and which can be chosen to symmetric in the @xmath232 indices @xcite .",
    "the energy density is @xmath233 , while the energy current is @xmath234 , where @xmath235 .",
    "the conservation of the 3-tensor @xmath230 implies three constants of motion , the total energy and the total momentum : @xmath236 now using the symmetry of @xmath230 , and in particular @xmath237 , we conclude that the spatial integral of the energy current @xmath238 is also conserved [ contrast this with ( [ st4 ] ) , in which the spatial integral over the spin current was not conserved ] .",
    "as the thermal conductivity is given by a kubo formula involving the energy current , we conclude that heat transport is ballistic and the thermal conductivity is infinite in the scaling limits defined by @xmath192 .",
    "the above theories describe excitations in superconductors , and a complete description of charge transport , and an accounting of the conservation of total charge , requires inclusion of the cooper pairs [ alternatively stated , we have to include the fluctuations of @xmath33 in ( [ orders ] ) ] .",
    "however , in a frequency regime where the response is dominated by quasiparticle excitations , we can consider the predictions of @xmath192 alone .",
    "the quasiparticle contribution to the electrical current is  @xcite the 2-vector @xmath239 . in general",
    "there is nothing special about this operator : it will acquire anomalous dimensions at the critical point , and this will lead to a contribution to the charge conductivity which has prefactors of a non - universal constant and an anomalous power of @xmath1 .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath180 only , an exceptional circumstance occurs : the action has @xmath240 symmetries corresponding to global changes in the phases of @xmath241 , and corresponding conserved 3-currents @xmath242 .",
    "note that these 3-currents do _ not _ correspond to the conservation of physical electrical charge : rather , the @xmath70 component of these 3-currents happen to be equal to the @xmath243 components of the electrical current @xmath244 .",
    "the conservations of these currents implies that the spatial integral of @xmath244 is a constant of motion , and hence the quasiparticle contribution to the charge conductivity is a zero - frequency delta function for @xmath180 .",
    "this paper has identified quantum field theories at which the nodal quasiparticles of a @xmath11-wave superconductor undergo strong inelastic scattering .",
    "all these theories are associated with a quantum critical point between a @xmath11-wave superconductor and some other superconducting state @xmath3 ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we performed an exhaustive search among states @xmath3 associated with a spin - singlet , zero momentum , fermion bilinear order parameter , and found that only two candidates possessed a non - trivial quantum critical point : @xmath3 a @xmath245 or a @xmath246 superconductor . the quantum field theory for these cases is @xmath180 in ( [ dsid7 ] ) . among order parameters with a non - zero momentum",
    ", we had to permit a fine - tuning condition that the ordering momentum was equal to the spacing between two fermi points of the @xmath11-wave superconductor .",
    "two plausible cases of this kind had @xmath3 possessing co - existing spin - density wave order and @xmath11-wave superonductivity [ described by @xmath181 in ( [ bfn ] ) ] or co - existing charge - density wave order and @xmath11-wave superconductivity [ described by @xmath190 in ( [ s3 ] ) ] .",
    "we reviewed the single particle ( section  [ single ] ) and transport ( section  [ trans ] ) properties of @xmath192 .",
    "an important observation was that there is no simple relationship between the relaxation times associated with these observables .",
    "in particular , strong scattering between the fermionic and bosonic modes can lead to very short single particle lifetimes and broad spectral functions ( section  [ single ] ) . at the same time",
    ", these scattering processes can do little to degrade the transport current : the thermal conductivity of @xmath192 was found to be infinite in the continuum scaling limit .",
    "comparison of the above results with experiments requires some understanding of the effects of corrections to scaling , and of impurity scattering .",
    "initial steps in this direction have been taken  @xcite , and studies for transport properties are in progress .    keeping the above cautions in mind ,",
    "we offer a possible interpretation of recent thermal conductivity measurements @xcite .",
    "a strong enhancement of the thermal hall conductivity , @xmath247 , is observed as @xmath1 is lowered , but @xmath247 saturates and decreases below @xmath248 k. the enhancement suggests large fluctuations of chiral order@xcite , as is the case when @xmath3 is a @xmath249 superconductor ( for @xmath250 this state has a non - zero @xmath247 even in zero field @xcite ) .",
    "so we suggest that the experimental system is in the vicinity of such a state @xmath3 but has @xmath251 , and the crossover at the dashed line in fig  [ fig1 ] occurs at @xmath252 k. a testable implication is that the photoemission linewidths of the nodal fermions should be @xmath253 down to 28 k , and then cross over to behavior expected in an ordinary bcs @xmath0 superconductor at lower @xmath1 .",
