    "the experimental progress on trapping ultracold atoms in tightly confined waveguides in a well - controlled way @xcite has stimulated intensive study of the physical properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum gases .",

    "the tg gas describes the strongly repulsive bose gas @xcite .",
    "starting from the tg gas and then switching the interaction between atoms from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive , the experimental realization of a 1d _ super _ tonks - girardeau ( stg ) gas of bosonic cesium atoms was reported very recently @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the tg gas , the stg gas describes a gas - like phase of the attractive bose gas @xcite , which is metastable against falling into its cluster - type ground state @xcite , despite the fact that the interaction between atoms is strongly attractive @xcite .",
    "although the stg gas realized in @xcite is a metastable highly excited state of the attractive bose gas , in recent theoretical work chen2 it was found that the ground state of a strongly attractive spin-1/2 fermi gas can be effectively described by the stg gas .",
    "intuitively , two fermions with opposite spins form a tightly bound state and the bound pairs of fermions can be viewed as composite bosons with a mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the effective interaction between the composite bosons is also attractive with the interaction strength given by @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "conversely , the ground state of the bound fermi pairs is described by the stg phase of attractive bosons @xcite . very recently",
    ", multi - component fermi gases have attracted considerable interest @xcite due to the novel existence of different sizes of molecules .",
    "here we consider the interesting question of whether the ground state of a strongly attractive multi - component fermionic system can be also effectively described by a stg gas of multi - particle bound states .",
    "a positive answer is confirmed by explicit identification of the general mapping relation between the attractive su(@xmath0 ) fermi gas and the stg gas .",
    "we consider a delta - function interacting system composed of @xmath3 atomic attractive fermions with equal mass @xmath4 which occupy @xmath0 hyperfine levels with identical particle numbers @xmath5 @xmath6 and constrained by periodic boundary conditions to a line of length @xmath7 .",
    "if the interactions are spin independent , the hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the interaction strength with @xmath10 the 1d effective s - wave scattering length .",
    "although the interactions in hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) are represented in terms of delta interaction , the exchange antisymmetric wavefunction for fermions gives the restriction that interactions among the same fermion level are prohibited .",
    "different symmetries of the wavefunction produce different bethe ansatz equations even if the hamiltonian has the same form as eq .",

    "no tightly bound state with more than @xmath0 fermions can be formed in an @xmath0-component fermi gas due to the pauli exclusion principle .",

    "if @xmath0 is odd , the tightly bound state can only be viewed as a composite fermion . obviously , strongly attractive su(@xmath0 )",
    "fermions with @xmath0 odd can not be mapped to an effective bosonic gas as for the two - component case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show that it can be mapped to a spinless fermi gas with weakly interacting p - wave interaction .",
    "due to a general fermi - bose mapping @xcite , eigenstates of a spinless fermi gas with p - wave interaction of any strength can be mapped to those of a 1d bose gas with delta - function interactions .",
    "therefore the gas - like state of a weakly repulsive p - wave fermi gas can be viewed as the fermi correspondence of the stg phase of a strongly attractive bose gas .    before construction of the mapping between the ground state of the strongly attractive su(@xmath0 ) fermi gas and the stg phase of composite bosons or fermions , we first discuss the solution of the su(@xmath0 ) fermi gas which is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz method .",
