    "however , the dynamics of two - component becs is effected by two kinds of interactions , i.e. intraspecies and interspecies interactions . although previous study @xcite reveals the paired tunnelling occurs as interspecies interaction increases , which considers a situation that the atoms of two components are separately prepared in different traps initially , a thorough study of quantum dynamics is not addressed .",
    "for example , how the dynamical behaviors of each component and whole system are influenced by intraspecies and interspecies interactions is not studied . in the following , by varying the parameters , we will examine the quantum dynamics of such system .",

    "below threshold , the dynamics oscillates with revivals at latter times . while above threshold",

    "as we have shown , it can only happen above threshold when the particles are prepared in a single well initially . below threshold or evolving from state @xmath94 at @xmath122",
    "it will not occurs .",
    "this is true for the symmetric situation .",
    "however when the system contains two kinds of atoms ( such as @xmath123k and @xmath56rb @xcite ) or the interspecies interaction of these two - component becs is varied by the application of magnetic control @xcite , this effect will happen for individual components .",
    "our numerical studies demonstrate it becomes obvious when the tunneling @xmath54 are not equal to the interactions @xmath55 and at the same time at least one of them ( @xmath74 and @xmath19 ) should be above threshold . in fig ( [ asf ] )",
    ", we have plot some of the results .",
    "it appears that the atoms of each components are favor to stay in the original wells with time .",
    "if we increase the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath19 ( both above threshold ) , the self - trapping of individual components become more distinct . while one of them below threshold , it will demand the difference much greater to trigger the effects .",
    "a particularly striking aspect of the present study is that it allows one to obtain quantum correlations between components .",
    "the correlated states of becs in a double - well model have been a most active research areas , for which open the opportunity to create many - particle entanglement in macroscopic systems @xcite .",
