    "one - loop effective actions @xcite are space - time integrals of lorentz and gauge - invariant expressions .",
    "they are closely related to traces of heat kernels , known as schwinger - dewitt @xcite , gilkey - seeley @xcite , or hadamard @xcite coefficients . in flat space - time gauge theory , these coefficients are polynomials consisting of a matrix potential , the gauge - field strength tensor , and gauge - covariant derivatives .",
    "there are many equivalent forms for these coefficients essentially due to the bianchi identity and the product rule for covariant derivatives .",
    "furthermore , the physically interesting functional trace allows one to cyclically exchange matrix factors and to integrate by parts .    increasing use of computer algebra @xcite and new methods to calculate effective actions @xcite extend our knowledge of heat kernel coefficients to higher and higher order . to manage the increasing number of terms in them and compare results obtained by different methods , a minimal set of invariants",
    "is needed in terms of which all results can be expressed . in addition , an algorithm to expand a given gauge - invariant lorentz scalar into this minimal set should be provided .",
    "this problem was mainly considered in general relativity where the tensor polynomials consist of the riemann tensor , the metric tensor , and covariant derivatives .",
    "this is more complicated than flat space - time gauge theory due to the symmetry properties of the riemann tensor .",
    "however , fulling et al .",
    "@xcite used group representation methods to determine the numbers of independent monomials , so that an appropriate subset of all monomials can be chosen to be a basis .",
    "nevertheless , this subset has to be chosen by hand because there is no known general construction principle .    for gauge theory in flat space - time , van de ven @xcite constructed a basis up to mass dimension ten ( fifth order of the inverse mass expansion ) .",
    "but he also chose the basis elements by hand and did not present a general construction principle .",
    "for the expansion of effective actions of matter , gauge fields , and gravity in terms of barvinsky - vilkovisky form factors @xcite , a basis set of non - local invariants up to third order in the curvature was defined @xcite .    the present article , extending our work in ref .",
    "@xcite , analyses the formal structure of lorentz and gauge - invariant monomials in non - abelian gauge theories with matter in flat space - time .",
    "step by step , the operations applicable to these invariants are used to bring them into a form consisting of special invariant monomials .",
    "these are proven to be linearly independent .",
    "thus , a basis set of invariants is specified , and simultaneously , a procedure to expand a given lorentz and gauge - invariant expression in terms of the basis is obtained .",
    "section 2 introduces notations , manipulations applicable to invariants , and a graphical representation of invariants , which is needed for the proof of linear independence .",
    "section 3 describes the algorithm to expand a given gauge - invariant lorentz scalar in terms of special gauge - invariant monomials .",
    "the properties of these monomials are summarized in section 4 .",
    "they are used to count the special monomials up to mass dimension 16 .",
    "section 5 shows that this set of monomials is linearly independent and therefore a basis .",
    "we summarize in section 6 .",
    "appendix a describes manipulations with fully symmetrized covariant derivatives .",
    "the numbers of independent invariants , subdivided by the number of matrix potentials and field - strength tensors , are given in appendix b. also the basis invariants up to mass dimension eight are listed there explicitly .",
    "appendix c describes a construction needed for the proof of linear independence .",
    "we consider a gauged scalar field theory described by the massive complex field @xmath0 and the hermitian matrix valued gauge field @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge - covariant derivative in the fundamental representation is @xmath2 .",
    "the coupling constant is absorbed into the gauge field .",
    "the matter field contribution to the effective one - loop action is given by @xmath3=    { { \\rm\\;tr}}\\ln\\left(-{{\\cal d}}^2+m^2+v\\right)=    -\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{{{\\rm d}}t}{t}{{\\rm e}}^{-tm^2 }    { { \\rm\\;tr}}\\exp\\left(-t\\left(-{{\\cal d}}^2+v\\right)\\right)\\ ] ] the integral in equation ( [ eff . action ] ) is to be understood regularized at @xmath4 in some way , e.g.  by dimensional regularization @xcite , by the zeta function procedure @xcite or by a cut - off .",
    "the trace of the heat kernel can be evaluated by various methods @xcite and expanded in gauge - invariant terms @xcite @xmath5 the matrix potential @xmath6 is hermitian and originates from the self - interaction of the matter field .",

    ", we call the possibility of cyclic matrix permutations under the trace _ cyclic invariance _ , and that of mirror transformations _ reflection invariance_. the latter stems from the possibility of matrix transpositions under the trace . the scope of the present article is to fix all manipulation possibilities and to obtain a basis for the gauge - invariant are lorentz invariant but , in the strict sense , not gauge invariant . however , here we understand @xmath19 always to stand inside a trace , which results in gauge - invariant quantities , and call them loosely invariants , too . ]",
