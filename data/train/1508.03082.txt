    "the development of future communication and information technologies is expected to rely heavily on the precise manipulation of physical systems at the nano- and sub - nanoscale . for this reason , coherent control of quantum systems",
    "has become a major goal in physical sciences over the past decades . in this context , the design and implementation of quantum control methods has raised a lot of interest , and many theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works have been devoted to this subject .",
    "+ controlled quantum operations are tipically intended to be performed in the fastest possible way , in order to avoid unwanted environmental effects which can destroy the coherence properties of the system . because of this , deriving time - optimal control protocols is a goal of major importance .",
    "this task is usually tackled by means of quantum optimal control ( qoc ) theory . there , the typical problem is to derive the shape of the control field @xmath0 required in order to optimize a particular dynamical process for a quantum system described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a typical objective in quantum control is to perform a transition from a given initial state @xmath2 to another goal state @xmath3 . in some cases",
    ", the optimization can be carried out analitically @xcite , but most generally its approached numerically @xcite .",
    "+ one of the weak points of the usual algorithms employed for solving qoc problems ( such as krotov or grape @xcite , although interesting alternatives have been proposed recently @xcite ) is that the solution for the field @xmath0 often appears to be hardly realizable in practice @xcite .",
    "this originates from the fact that the value of the field at each instant acts as an independent control ( i.e. there are no constraints derived from the truncation of a given basis set of functions @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this allows for a much faster convergence of the optimization procedure , but the resulting control field can present non - smooth fluctuations which would require a large field bandwith to be implemented . moreover , from a theoretical perspective , the complex shape of the field usually prevents us to understand the physical mechanisms involved in the control processes .",
    "nevermind this feature , qoc theory has been proven to show deep connections with the fundamentals of quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite studied the performance of qoc in various systems as a function of the ( fixed ) evolution time @xmath4 that is fed to the algorithm .",
    "they found that the optimization converged succesfully only when @xmath4 was above certain threshold , which they identified with the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) time , @xmath5 .",
    "the concept of qsl was introduced originally by mandelstam and tamm @xcite , who showed that a generalization of the usual time - energy uncertainty relation imposed bounds on the speed of evolution of a quantum system . since then",
    ", many authors have explored the qsl in various situations @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we study time - optimal control processes in quantum systems which show several local two - level interactions in the form of avoided crossings ( acs ) in their energy spectrum .",
    "this situation is of interest in a wide variety of quantum mechanical systems , such as molecular dipoles interacting with electric fields @xcite , ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , rydberg atoms @xcite and superconducting qubits @xcite . using this particular interaction between the states of the system ,",
    "we generate initial guesses for the control protocols using piecewise - constant functions derived from previous studies @xcite . in a recent work",
    ", we studied the qsl time for these protocols by using qoc , and showed that the calculated qsl time is in general smaller than the sum of the optimal times for each avoided crossing @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the analysis of the optimal control protocols which lead to such speed - up .",
    "for that purpose , we investigate numerically the control fields that generate the time - optimal evolution and find that they can be fully characterized by just a few parameters .",
    "this allows us to propose a simple analytical dependence for the control field .",

    "we first consider a quantum two - level system described by the following hamiltonian matrix    @xmath6    which is written in the basis @xmath7 .",
    "these states are usually called the diabatic states of the system , which diagonalize the hamiltonian when the control parameter @xmath8 . in general , the eigenvalues @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 form a hyperbolae in the @xmath12 plane , whose vertex represents an avoided crossing ( ac ) with an energy gap @xmath13 .",

    "+ the model presented above is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics as it accounts for many interesting phenomena , such as landau - zener transitions @xcite , landau - zener - stuckelberg interferometry @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the control problems that can be formulated when @xmath13 is regarded as a fixed parameter , and @xmath14 can vary in time . a famous example is the problem of driving this system from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in the shortest possible time , for some @xmath21 .",
    "interesting discussions about the solution to this problem , which include numerical , experimental and analytical studies can be found in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we will focus in a particular result .",
    "when @xmath22 , the control problem stated above reduces to the full population transfer between @xmath23 between @xmath24 .",

    "the two - level model described in the previous section can be extended and generalized to account for the presence of several acs in a many - level scenario . here",
    "we construct a model for such situation .",

    "when @xmath44 for @xmath45 , the hamiltonian is diagonal in that basis , and the energy spectrum consists merely on a series of horizontal and diagonal straight branches with degeneracies at values of @xmath46 corresponding to states @xmath47 and @xmath48 . if one of the couplings is non - zero , say @xmath49 , the degeneracy at @xmath50 is lifted and an ac is generated with a minimum energy gap of @xmath51 . as a consequence ,",
