    "designing of energy - efficient mec requires the joint allocation of communication and computation resources among distributed mobiles and mec servers at bss . emerging research toward this direction considers optimal resource allocation for various types of mec systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite consider single - user mec systems with one bs and multiple elastic tasks , and study optimal offloading control and resource allocation ( such as cpu - cycle frequency allocation and power allocation ) to minimize the average execution delay of all tasks under power constraints . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider single - user mec systems with one bs and a single inelastic task , and study optimal offloading control and resource allocation to minimize the total energy consumption under a hard deadline constraint .",
    "in particular , @xcite obtains an optimal threshold - based offloading policy and optimal cpu - cycle frequency and power allocation . in @xcite , optimal cpu - cycle frequency allocation and time division between microwave power transfer and offloading",

    "reference @xcite considers a multi - user mec system with one bs and an inelastic task for each user , and studies optimal task splitting and resource allocation to minimize the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under a hard deadline constraint .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the optimal task splitting policy is of a threshold - based structure .",

    "( i ) all these papers assume that the size of the computation result for each task is negligible , and fail to take account of the resource consumption for downloading the computation results back to mobiles .",

    ", we shall address the above issues .",
    "we consider energy - efficient resource allocation for a multi - user mec system with one bs of computing capability and multiple users each with an inelastic task .",
    "first , we propose a more practical task model , specifying each task using three parameters , i.e. , size of the task before computation , workload and size of the computation result .",

    "[ system_model ] , we consider a multi - user mec system consisting of one single - antenna base station ( bs ) and @xmath0 single - antenna mobiles , denoted by set @xmath1 .",
    "the bs has powerful computing capability by running it based servers of a constant cpu - cycle frequency ( in number of cpu - cycles per second ) at the network edge .",
    "each mobile has a computation - intensive and latency - sensitive ( computation ) task , which is offloaded to the bs for executing .    we first propose a more practical computation task model .",
    "the computation task at mobile @xmath2 , referred to as task @xmath3 , is characterized by three parameters , i.e. , the size of the task before computation @xmath4 ( in bits ) , workload @xmath5 ( in number of cpu - cycles ) , and the size of the computation result @xmath6 ( in bits ) .",
    "the computation of each task @xmath3 has to be accomplished within @xmath7 seconds .",
    "note that this computation task model generalizes those in @xcite in the sense that the size of the computation result is taken into consideration .    offloading task @xmath3 to the bs for executing comprises three sequential operations : 1 ) uploading task @xmath3 of @xmath8 bits from mobile @xmath3 to the bs ; 2 ) executing task @xmath3 at the bs ( which requires @xmath9 bs cpu - cycles ) ; 3 ) downloading the computation result of @xmath10 bits from the bs to mobile @xmath3 .",

    ", we will consider a computation - offloading model with non - negligible bs executing duration .",
    "we consider time division multiple access ( tdma ) with time - division duplexing ( tdd ) operation .",
    "the processing order of @xmath0 tasks does not matter when the bs executing duration is negligible , since the total completion time is always the sum of the uploading and downloading durations for all tasks .",
    "thus , the uploading and downloading duration allocation satisfies : @xmath19    similar to @xcite and @xcite , we consider low cpu voltage at the bs , and model the energy consumption for bs executing as follows . at the bs ,",
    "the amount of energy consumption for computation in a single cpu - cycle with frequency @xmath16 is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant factor determined by the switched capacitance at the mec servers .",

    "let @xmath24 denote the transmission power of mobile @xmath3 for uploading task @xmath3 .",
    "then , the achievable transmission rate ( in bit / s ) for uploading task @xmath3 is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bandwidth ( in hz ) and the variance of complex white gaussian channel noise , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission rate for uploading task @xmath3 is fixed as @xmath28 , since this is the most energy - efficient transmission method for transmitting @xmath8 bits in @xmath29 seconds .",

    "then , we have @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the energy consumption at mobile @xmath3 for uploading task @xmath3 to the bs is given by : @xmath32 similarly , the energy consumption at the bs for transmitting the computation result of task @xmath3 to mobile @xmath3 is given by : @xmath33 thus , the energy consumption at the bs for executing and transmitting task @xmath3 is given by : @xmath34 the weighted sum energy consumption for executing task @xmath3 by offloading to the bs is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the corresponding weight factor .",
    "therefore , the overall weighted sum energy consumption for executing the @xmath0 tasks by offloading to the bs is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that the computation - offloading model with negligible bs executing duration considered in this paper is a generalization of those in @xcite in the sense that task downloading and the corresponding resource consumption are considered .",

    "thus , using lemma [ solve_t ] , we can compute @xmath41 efficiently .",
    "the optimal solution adapts to the operations and the channel conditions .",
    "in particular , for given @xmath44 , the uploading and downloading durations of a task increase with the size of the task and the size of the computation result , respectively , and both decrease with the channel power gain .",
    "in this section , we consider a more practical scenario where the bs executing duration is non - negligible .",
    "we first elaborate on the computation - offloading model in this scenario .",
    "then , we formulate the energy minimization problem for the multi - user mec system with bs executing duration . finally , we characterize the optimal solution and propose a low - complexity sub - optimal solution with promising performance .      in this part , task executing duration at the bs is considered .",
    "in addition , note that the execution of one task and the transmission of another task can be conducted at the same time .",
    "these make the computation - offloading model with non - negligible bs executing duration sufficiently different from the one without bs executing duration , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we would like to minimize the overall weighted sum energy consumption for the multi - user mec with non - negligible bs executing duration under the uploading and downloading duration allocation constraints .",

    "problem [ c_original ] is a mixed discrete - continuous optimization problem with two main challenges .",
    "one is the choice of the operation sequence selection ( discrete variable ) , and the other is the choice of the uploading and downloading duration allocation ( continuous variables ) .",
