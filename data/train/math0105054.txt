    "a * domino * is a @xmath4 by @xmath5 or a @xmath5 by @xmath4 rectangle , whose vertices have integer coordinates in the plane .",

    "then @xmath2 has a natural topology , where two tilings are close if they agree on a large neighborhood of the origin . in this topology , @xmath2 is compact , and @xmath6 acts continuously on @xmath2 by translations .",
    "burton and pemantle @xcite proved that there is a unique invariant measure @xmath0 of maximal entropy for this action .",
    "this measure has the following property : let @xmath7 be any tiling of a finite region @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the set of tilings in @xmath2 extending @xmath7 ( we call @xmath9 * the cylinder set generated by @xmath7 * )",
    ". then @xmath10 only depends on @xmath8 and not on the choice @xmath7 of a tiling of @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we compute @xmath10 explicitly , for any finite tiling @xmath7 .",
    "we will prove in section [ dominopf ] that :    [ domc ] there is a function @xmath11 with the following property .",
    "let @xmath12 be any finite set of disjoint dominos , covering  black \" squares @xmath13 and  white \" squares @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath15 is the absolute value of the determinant of the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "( here @xmath19 is the translation vector from square @xmath20 to square @xmath21 . )",
    "we call @xmath22 the * coupling function * for @xmath0",
    ". it can be computed explicitly ( see theorem [ pdoms ] below ) , and the values of @xmath22 are in @xmath23 .",
    "a similar result holds for tilings of the plane with lozenges .",
    "a * lozenge * is a rhombus with side @xmath5 , smaller angle @xmath24 , and vertices in the lattice @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we define a measure @xmath1 on the space @xmath3 of lozenge tilings , which is the limit of uniform measures on periodic tilings , and show that its entropy equals the topological entropy of the @xmath6-action .",
    "( for a background on measure - theoretic and topological entropy see @xcite . )",
    "we conjecture that @xmath1 is the _",
    "unique _ measure of maximal entropy .",
    "we compute the coupling function for @xmath1 in theorem [ lozcouple ] : it takes values in @xmath26 .",
    "we give several applications of these two results .",
    "first , it is known that the translation - action of @xmath6 on dominos or lozenges is topologically mixing ( if two events are far enough apart , one can find a single tiling containing both of them ) .",
    "we show here that it is * strongly mixing * for the measures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that is , events that are far apart are almost independent .",
    "in particular we show that the convergence rate to independence is at least quadratic in the distance , that is , for any two finite tilings @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath1 ; see theorem [ mixing ] .",
    "there is a corresponding lower bound when @xmath31 are single tiles .",
    "correlations for single tiles have been previously computed by fisher and stephenson @xcite and stephenson @xcite .",
    "another application is to the computation of the variance of the height function for @xmath1 .",
    "the * height function * of a lozenge tiling was introduced by blte and hilhorst @xcite .",
    "we compute for @xmath1 the variance of the height function in the @xmath32-direction ( theorem [ var ] ) , that is , the variance in height between two vertices separated by distance @xmath33 in the @xmath32-direction .",
    "this variance is related to the expected number of  contour lines \" separating the two points ( proposition [ contours ] ) .",
    "the variance in other directions can also be computed with the same methods , although we could not obtain a closed form . on the other hand",
    ", domino tilings also have a height function , but we were not able to compute its variance using the methods here .",
    "a third application which we will not discuss here is to the computation of entropy @xmath34 of tilings whose height function has a fixed average slope , that is , the set of tilings of the plane whose height function @xmath35 satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "this computation is used in @xcite to give a method of counting the approximate number of tilings of any region , by maximizing an entropy functional over the region .",
    "the results of this paper are very general . using a result of kasteleyn @xcite , we can compute cylinder set measures ( for certain measures of maximal entropy ) for the space of perfect matchings on any periodic planar graph . here  periodic \" means the graph is finite modulo an action of @xmath6 by translations . in particular hurst and green @xcite showed that the * ising model * on a planar graph with nearest - neighbor interactions can be represented as a matching problem on another planar graph ( actually they showed this in an equivalent form ) . our method",
    "therefore allows one to compute the local probabilities for the ising model .",
    "indeed , methods similar to those in this paper were used in montroll , potts and ward @xcite to compute long - range correlations for the ising model .",
    "the coupling function which we define is analogous to the green s function for a resistor network ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , subdeterminants of the green s function matrix give probabilities of finding subsets of edges in a random spanning tree .",
    "there is a well - known connection between domino tilings and spanning trees : burton and pemantle @xcite have found , via enumeration of spanning trees , the measures of certain cylinder sets for dominos .",
    "our method , which is different , gives the measure of all cylinder sets and is adaptable to planar graphs where the spanning tree connection is not known to hold .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ bkgd ] discusses background : we show how to compute the number of tilings as a determinant , and we define @xmath37 and the height function . in section [ cyls ]",
    "we show how to compute the cylinder set measures for finite planar graphs . in section [ lozs ]",
    "we compute explicitly the coupling function for @xmath1 and give the applications .",
    "we chose in this section to concentrate on the case of lozenges rather than dominos since lozenges seem to be less prominent in the mathematics literature .",
    "section [ dominopf ] restates the results of section [ lozs ] for dominos .",
    "let @xmath38 be a graph .",
    "two edges of @xmath38 are * disjoint * if they have no vertices in common .",
    "a * perfect matching * of @xmath38 is a set of disjoint edges which contains all the vertices .",
    "if @xmath38 is finite , connected and bipartite , we say @xmath38 is * balanced * if there are the same number of vertices in each half of the bipartition .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the graph whose vertices are @xmath6 and whose edges join every pair of vertices of distance @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to see that domino tilings of the plane correspond bijectively to perfect matchings of @xmath6 .",
    "the graph @xmath6 is bipartite : color the vertex @xmath39 black if @xmath40 , otherwise color it white . note that then a domino  covers \" exactly one vertex of each color .",
    "similarly , lozenge tilings correspond bijectively to perfect matchings of a particular bipartite planar graph @xmath41 , the `` honeycomb '' grid .",
    "the graph @xmath41 is the @xmath5-skeleton of the periodic tiling of the plane with regular hexagons ( see figure [ hexgraph ] ) .    rather than use lozenges as defined in the introduction , we adopt the following coordinates .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the set of vertices of @xmath41 is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are the  black \" vertices , and @xmath46 are the  white \" vertices .",
    "there is an edge between every pair of vertices at unit distance .",
    "we will denote the vertex @xmath47 by the triple @xmath48 , and a vertex @xmath49 by the triple @xmath50 . hopefully denoting vertices with ordered triples will not confuse the reader .",
    "note also that a lozenge has side @xmath51 in these coordinates .",
    "kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite independently computed the number of perfect matchings of an @xmath52 grid ( in other words , the number of domino tilings of an @xmath52 rectangle ) .",
    "kasteleyn in @xcite also computed the number of matchings on a toroidal graph in the case of dominos .",
    "later , in @xcite , he showed how to compute the number of perfect matchings of general planar graphs ( thereby including the case of lozenges ) .",
    "his method is to count tilings using pfaffians .",
    "we outline here an adaptation of his proof for the case of a simply - connected subgraph of @xmath41 .",
    "we say that a subgraph of @xmath41 is * simply connected * if it is the @xmath5-skeleton of a simply connected union of `` basic hexagons '' of @xmath41 .",
    "the following is a special case of the results of @xcite :    let @xmath53 be a finite simply connected subgraph of @xmath41 .",
    "the number of perfect matchings of @xmath53 equals @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath53 .",
    "here is a sketch of the proof : since the graph @xmath56 is bipartite , we have @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 .",
    "order the vertices @xmath60 so that those in @xmath61 comes first .",
    "we then can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath61 and @xmath64 have the same cardinality @xmath33 ( that is , @xmath53 is balanced ) , for otherwise there are no perfect matchings ( and @xmath65 is clearly @xmath66 )",
    ". then the determinant of the square matrix @xmath67 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the sum is over bijections @xmath70 . each _",
    "term in the sum corresponds to a matching .",
    "one need only check ( and this is the most interesting part , although we wo nt do it here ) that each term has the same sign .",
    "thus @xmath71 .",
    "this same method also works for dominos , except that one must modify the adjacency matrix to make the signs in ( [ detb ] ) work out right .",
    "one way to modify it is to put weight @xmath72 on vertical edges @xcite .",
    "it is slightly more complicated to count matchings on a graph embedded on a torus .",
    "kasteleyn showed that , for a graph on a torus , one can count matchings using a sum of @xmath73 pfaffians ( see lemma [ bbbb ] below )",
    ".      an important issue not dealt with by kasteleyn is the appropriate sense in which random tilings of large finite regions in the plane resemble random tilings of the whole plane .    indeed ,",
    "as the work of @xcite shows , the local configuration of the boundary of a region has a drastic effect on the number of perfect matchings , and hence one must take care when computing the measure @xmath0 as a limit of measures on tilings of finite regions .",
    "a * tiling with free boundary conditions * , or simply * free tiling * , of a region @xmath8 is a tiling of @xmath8 , where the tiles are allowed to protrude beyond the boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "the * topological entropy * of domino tilings is by definition @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the set of free tilings of a @xmath16 square . here",
    "the square regions @xmath75 can be replaced by any sequence of  sufficiently nice \" regions , for example , convex regions containing squares of size tending to infinity . in this case one",
    "divides by the area of the @xmath76-th region , not by @xmath77 .",
    "the same definition also applies to lozenge tilings ( replace the @xmath16 square with for example the set of vertices in a @xmath16 square centered at the origin ) .",
    "the * entropy * @xmath78 of a translation - invariant measure @xmath79 on domino tilings of the plane can be defined by @xmath80 we have @xmath81 for any translation - invariant measure @xmath79 on @xmath2 , since , as the reader may readily show , for a finite set of real numbers @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the quantity @xmath85 is maximized when the @xmath86 are equal .    for any measure",
    "@xmath79 defined on the finite set @xmath87 of tilings of a finite region @xmath88 , the entropy ( per site ) of @xmath79 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the probability of the tiling @xmath91 .",
    "burton and pemantle showed :    [ unique ] there is a unique measure of maximal entropy @xmath0 for domino tilings of the plane .",
    "the entropy of @xmath0 equals the topological entropy @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the quotient of @xmath6 by the lattice of translations generated by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath93 is a graph ( on a torus ) with @xmath96 vertices .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the uniform measure on perfect matchings of @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath98 be a weak limit of @xmath97 as @xmath99 .",
    "we claim that @xmath100 . to see this",
    ", kasteleyn @xcite showed that the entropy of @xmath97 converges as @xmath99 to the entropy of @xmath0 .",
    "so it suffices to show the limit of the entropies is the entropy of the limit .",
    "let @xmath101 by a @xmath76-by-@xmath76 window in @xmath6 ( or on @xmath93 when @xmath102 and @xmath33 are larger than @xmath76 ) .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the restriction ( projection ) of @xmath97 to @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath103 converges to @xmath104 by weak convergence .",
    "since there are only a finite number of configurations on @xmath101 , @xmath105 since @xmath106 we have @xmath107 taking limits over @xmath76 gives @xmath108 and therefore by the theorem @xmath100 .",
    "we would like to thank jeff steif and jim propp for the idea behind this argument .",
    "burton and pemantle s proof of theorem [ unique ] above uses a connection between spanning trees and domino tilings .",
    "lozenge tilings are in fact also in bijection with a set of spanning trees , or rather , directed spanning trees (  arborescences \" ) on a directed triangular grid , see @xcite .",
    "however it is not evident how to adapt the proof of @xcite to this case .",
    "we will show nevertheless that the uniform measures on certain toroidal graphs converge to a measure @xmath1 , and their entropy converges to the topological entropy . by the argument following theorem",
    "[ unique ] , the entropy of @xmath1 equals the topological entropy .",
    "the only fact missing is the uniqueness of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath109 be the quotient of @xmath41 by the lattice of translations generated by @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "then @xmath109 is a graph with @xmath112 vertices .",
    "let @xmath113 be the uniform measure on matchings of @xmath109 .",
    "the entropy of @xmath114 converges to the topological entropy of lozenge tilings of the plane .",
    "[ loztori ]    the proof is a simple variant of an unpublished trick due to g. kuperberg .",
    "let @xmath115 be the set of free lozenge tilings of the region @xmath116 , where @xmath116 consists of an equilateral triangle of side @xmath117 ( recall that a lozenge has side length @xmath51 ) .",
    "then @xmath115 is partitioned into equivalence classes , two tilings being equivalent if they have the same set of tiles which protrude beyond the boundary .",
    "the number of equivalence classes is less than @xmath118 for some constant @xmath119 , so some equivalence class @xmath120 must satisfy @xmath121    reflect the region @xmath116 along one of its edges @xmath122 .",
    "given any two tilings @xmath123 there is a tiling of the union of @xmath116 and its reflection , where the @xmath116 is filled with @xmath27 and its reflection is filled with the reflection of @xmath28 .",
    "this is because the tiles which protrude across the boundary edge @xmath122 are _ fixed _ under this reflection .",
    "take the union of @xmath124 reflections of @xmath116 so as to make the parallelogram of figure [ 33torus ] .",
    "given any @xmath124 elements of @xmath120 , we can fill them in the @xmath124 triangles to make a tiling of this whole parallelogram .",
    "furthermore , the configurations of tiles protruding beyond opposite boundaries of this parallelogram are translates of each other . as a consequence we can glue opposite sides of the parallelogram together to make a tiling of the @xmath125 by @xmath125 torus ( tilings of which correspond to perfect matchings of @xmath126 ) .",
    "we therefore have ( where @xmath127 is the set of tilings of @xmath126 ) @xmath128 this implies that @xmath129 which completes the proof .",
    "we will see later that @xmath130 and @xmath131 have the same limit as @xmath99 , so the restriction to the tori @xmath126 is unimportant .",
    "in fact we will show in section [ 4.4 ] that there is a _",
    "unique _ weak limit to the @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath1 be this limit .",
    "we make the following    * conjecture . *",
    "_ the measure @xmath1 is the unique measure of maximal entropy for lozenge tilings of the plane .",
    "_      for any perfect matching of a simply connected subgraph @xmath53 of @xmath41 one can associate an integer - valued * height function * to the faces of @xmath53 .",
    "( by * face * of @xmath53 we mean a basic hexagon which contains an edge of @xmath53 . )",
    "let @xmath7 be a perfect matching of @xmath53 .",
    "pick a face @xmath132 arbitrarily and assign it height @xmath133 . for any other face @xmath134 ,",
    "take a path @xmath135 of faces , where for each @xmath136 , @xmath137 is adjacent to @xmath138 along an unmatched edge",
    ". let @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath140 , where @xmath141 increases by @xmath5 if @xmath142 is in directions @xmath143 or @xmath144 and @xmath141 decreases by @xmath5 if @xmath142 is in directions @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "this defines a height on each face , which can easily be shown to be independent of the choice of path to that face .",
    "figure [ hts ] shows a height function for the matching in figure [ hexgraph ] .",
    "for dominos there is a similar definition ; see @xcite .    for a simply connected subgraph @xmath53 which has a perfect matching , the height function along the faces bounding the region ( that is , faces outside @xmath53 but containing an edge of @xmath53 )",
    "is well defined up to an additive constant and is independent of the matching @xcite ( rather , this is true if the union of @xmath41 and these faces is still simply connected ) .",
    "the results in this section are stated for lozenges , but they apply verbatim for dominos , on condition that one puts weight @xmath72 on vertical edges in the adjacency matrix @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath53 be a finite , balanced , simply connected subgraph of @xmath41 , with vertices @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "let @xmath149 be a subset of disjoint edges of @xmath53 , with @xmath150 for @xmath151 .    in the formula ( [ detb ] ) , each nonzero term in the sum corresponds to a perfect matching ; those terms whose matchings contain all the edges in @xmath12 are precisely the terms which contain the subproduct @xmath152    the _ sum _ of the terms containing this product is ( up to sign ) the product of @xmath153 with the determinant of the cofactor @xmath154 , that is , the determinant of the matrix obtained from @xmath67 by removing all rows @xmath155 and all columns @xmath156 .",
    "this can be proved inductively as follows .",
    "expand @xmath157 along the row @xmath158 : @xmath159 the only term that contains @xmath160 is the term for column @xmath161 , which is the term @xmath162 . now expand @xmath163 along row @xmath164 , and so on .",
    "thus the sum of the terms containing @xmath153 is @xmath165 .",
    "since @xmath166 this proves    the number of perfect matchings containing all edges in @xmath12 is @xmath167 [ first ]    later on the sign of @xmath168 will be important to us .",
    "we note therefore that the number of perfect matchings containing all the edges in @xmath12 is @xmath169    in a more general setting ( e.g. in @xcite ) one might wish to consider weighting the edges non - trivially , in which case the formula @xmath170 counts each matching according to the product of the weights on its edges .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath168 does not depend on the actual set of edges in @xmath12 , but only on the set of vertices involved .",
    "this shows , as expected , that each matching of the vertices of @xmath12 can be extended to the same number of perfect matchings .",
    "the matrix @xmath154 is an @xmath171 cofactor of @xmath67 ; its determinant is equal to @xmath157 times the determinant of the @xmath16 cofactor of the inverse of @xmath67 , @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the set of rows and columns not involved in @xmath12 .",
    "so we have    the number of perfect matchings containing all edges in @xmath12 is @xmath174 that is , @xmath175 more precisely , @xmath176 [ e ]    the advantage of this over proposition [ first ] is that the computation is a determinant of size @xmath76 rather than @xmath177 . in particular if @xmath12 consists of a single edge @xmath178 , the probability that that edge is in a random matching is the absolute value of the @xmath179-th entry of @xmath180 .",
    "the rest of the paper consists of the computation of @xmath180 and applications of theorem [ e ] .",

    "let @xmath194 be the matrices obtained from @xmath195 respectively , as in ( [ b ] ) .",
    "following kasteleyn , on condition that @xmath196 are both even , we have    [ bbbb ] the number of perfect matchings @xmath197 of @xmath109 is given by @xmath198    a term for each perfect matching appears in each of these four determinants .",
