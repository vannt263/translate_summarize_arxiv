    "the starting point of this investigation was the discussion of the carnot - bekenstein - process in the environment of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "there it was assumed that the black hole is surrounded by a cloud of radiation with a local temperature according to tolman s equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the usual hawking temperature at @xmath2 .",
    "this equation also follows for the equilibrium distribution of photons in relativistic kinetic theory @xcite or from elementary thermodynamical gedanken experiments @xcite .",
    "these yield a modified formula for the efficiency of the carnot - bekenstein - process @xmath3 between two heat reservoirs at different height . in the equilibrium we have @xmath4 which implies ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "all this holds as long as the back reaction of the radiation to the metric can be neglected .",
    "but , since @xmath5 , at the schwarzschild radius @xmath6 the temperature and the energy density diverges and can not longer be regarded as a mere perturbation .",
    "rather one would have to solve the field equation anew , this time allowing for the energy - stress tensor of the photon gas to act as a source of gravitation .",
    "it is not at all clear whether the resulting metric will be a modified black hole in some sense .",
    "so we have the following problem which may be considered independently of the original motivation :    calculate the static , spherically symmetric metric of einstein s field equations with the energy - stress tensor of a perfect fluid @xmath7 consisting of photons , i.e. @xmath8    in section 2 the corresponding field equations are transformed into an autonomous two  dimensional system of differential equations which is discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we investigate the metric of a photon star for @xmath9 and study its global properties by means of numerical solutions .",
    "physical characteristics like radius , mass and temperature are defined in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains concluding remarks .",
    "with except of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) the problem stated above is just the well - known problem of constructing the interior solution of a star .",
    "we may choose coordinates @xmath10 such that the metric is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unknown functions and @xmath14 is the surface element of a unit sphere .",
    "with respect to these coordinates the field equations boil down to a system of three coupled differential equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite 6.2.36.2.5 ) @xmath15 we recall that tolman s equation @xcite was derived under the same assumptions we made , except spherical symmetry",
    ". hence we may adopt ( [ 1 ] ) or , equivalently , @xmath16 since @xmath17 from local statistical mechanics , where @xmath18 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "we write @xmath19 and obtain from ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) @xmath20 eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is identically satisfied , which confirms tolman s result .",
    "otherwise the system of differential equations would be overdetermined .",
    "the set of solutions @xmath21 of the system ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) can be parameterized by 3 parameters , e.  g.  @xmath22 and two initial values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . but @xmath23 is invariant under the 2-parameter group of scale transformations @xmath24 thus there exists only a 1-parameter family of solutions looking qualitatively different .",
    "an equivalent second order equation is obtained by eliminating @xmath13 using @xmath25 and inserting the derivative of ( [ 15 ] ) into ( [ 12 ] ) : @xmath26    for @xmath27 we have the well - known equations which lead to a 2-parameter family of schwarzschild metrics . for @xmath28 we may scale every solution such that it becomes a solution with @xmath29 the remaining subgroup of ( [ 14 ] ) with @xmath30 may be used to simplify the differential equation ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "we perform the transformation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is arbitrary .",
    "the resulting reduced equations read @xmath33 note that this system is autonomous .",
    "the resulting symmetry @xmath34 reflects the scale invariance of ( [ 16 ] ) w.r . to the subgroup @xmath30 .",
    "even if we can not solve it exactly , it seems to be better accessible for intuition and developing approximation schemes .",
    "any two different solutions of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) correspond to different similarity classes of @xmath35 .",
    "we calculate some typical solutions of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) numerically and display them as curves in the @xmath36-plane .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath37 is a stable stationary point of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) which is an attractor of the whole open quadrant @xmath38 .",
    "it follows by inverting the transformation ( [ 18 ] ) that @xmath39 is an exact solution of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) which is asymptotically approached by any other solution for @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that the space - time of photon stars is not asymptotically flat .",
    "the other exact solution of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) @xmath41 yields @xmath42 and is hence unphysical . a typical solution curve of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] )",
    "starts from @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and runs close to the solution ( [ 23 ] ) until it reaches small values of @xmath46 .",
    "then according to the `` @xmath46 '' in the denominator of ( [ 20 ] ) , @xmath47 increases rapidly and the curve is turned up towards the @xmath48-axis .",
    "then it describes a parabolic - like bow and approaches the stationary point by a clockwise vortex .",
    "it is instructive to draw the general schwarzschild solutions ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 into the @xmath36-diagram .",
    "they are given by the family of parabolas @xmath51 which approximate the solution curves of ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) having the same vertex at @xmath52 in this way , for each solution @xmath53 of ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) we can define a unique schwarzschild approximation @xmath54 .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the solutions of ( [ 16 ] ) for @xmath55 which yield @xmath56 by ( [ 15 ] ) .    to study the behaviour for smaller @xmath57 we expand @xmath12 into a laurent series and insert this series into ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the series starts with @xmath58 in accordance with a schwarzschild solution for @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath59 are left undetermined since they represent the two initial values for ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "the next terms are uniquely determined by ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the first , say , 20 terms by using a computer algebra software like mathematica .",
    "here we only note down the first nonvanishing extra terms for @xmath12 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 for small @xmath57 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are also approximated by schwarzschild solutions , but unlike the approximation discussed above , we have to choose @xmath62 in order to obtain a positive solution @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath12 can not change its sign in a continuous way , since @xmath64 implies @xmath65 by ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "( according to the scale invariance ( [ 14 ] ) , @xmath55 may be multiplied by @xmath66 , but this gives no physically different solution . )",
    "thus we may state that for @xmath67 the metric looks like that of a schwarzschild black hole with negative mass , independent of @xmath22 .",
    "for the geodesic motion close to @xmath68 we may thus adopt the effective potential of schwarzschild theory ( @xcite 6.3.15 ) ( with @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 it follows that @xmath68 can never be reached by particles or photons due to the infinite high potential barrier .",
    "although curvature blows up for @xmath67 , as in the schwarzschild case , the nature of the singularity is less harmful .",
    "we conjecture that it can not be regarded as a `` naked singularity '' in whatever technical sense ( see @xcite for details of the various definitions ) and that cauchy surfaces still exist in the spacetime given by ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , if the line @xmath68 is excluded from the spacetime manifold .    from a computational point of view",
    ", the singularity of @xmath55 at @xmath68 suggests to transform ( [ 16 ] ) into a differential equation for @xmath72 and to re - transform to @xmath55 after a numerical solution for @xmath73 has been obtained .",
    "we used the ndsolve - command of mathematica to produce the following numerical solutions :    a typical solution is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "recall that for the schwarzschild metric @xmath56 diverges at @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for the solution of fig .",
    "2 @xmath56 has a relatively sharp maximum at @xmath76 and @xmath77 is becoming small . for @xmath78 , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are comparable with their schwarzschild approximations @xmath79 and @xmath80 , if @xmath57 is not too large . for @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath12 remains small within some shell @xmath82 and diverges for @xmath83 according to ( [ 29 ] ) . by ( [ 9 ] )",
    "this means that the energy density is concentrated within that shell and @xmath76 may be viewed as the `` radius of the photon star '' .",
    "other solutions with larger values of @xmath22 show a more diffuse cloud of photons and a less sharp maximum of @xmath13 , see fig .  3 and 4 .",
    "these solutions are all scaled to the same value of @xmath76 .",
    "we have seen that the set of solutions @xmath21 may be characterized by 3 parameters , e.  g.  @xmath59 and @xmath22 in ( [ 29 ] ) . from the analogy with the schwarzschild case ( @xmath49 )",
    "we expect that only a 2-parameter family represents physically different spacetimes . in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "one parameter is set to 1 by the choice of the units , and the remaining parameter @xmath84 distinguishes between black holes of different mass .",
    "more specifically , one postulates that the velocity of light , expressed by @xmath85 approaches 1 for @xmath86 .",
    "the metric then obtains the form @xmath87 in the case of the photon star , we can not proceed in the same way , since the metric will not be asymptotically flat .",
    "but instead we may postulate the `` gauge condition '' that the schwarzschild approximation of @xmath88 , defined in section 3 , should obey condition ( [ 34 ] ) . if this is not the case",
    ", one has to perform a suitable scale transformation ( [ 14 ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain a two - fold of physically different solutions .",
    "we now consider physical parameters characterizing this two - fold of solutions .",
    "one could be the radius @xmath76 of the photon star defined above .    in analogy to the schwarzschild theory ( @xcite 6.2.7 )",
    "we introduce the ( gravitational ) mass function @xmath89 in the domain where @xmath90 this is the `` would - be - mass '' of an equivalent black hole . in the domain @xmath91 the interpretation of ( [ 35 ] ) is not so obvious .",
    "as to be expected from the above discussion of the metric for @xmath67 , it turns out that @xmath92 . a typical mass function",
    "is shown in fig .  5 , where also the `` proper mass '' @xmath93 and the difference @xmath94 is displayed .",
    "it may be , as in this case , that the majority of the photons are `` hidden '' by the apparent negative mass in the center with respect to gravitation .",
    "nevertheless , we could use @xmath95 as a further physical parameter characterizing a photon star .",
    "generally , by ( [ 35 ] ) and @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 if @xmath99 we have @xmath100 , as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "+ as another physical parameter we consider the `` surface temperature '' @xmath101    if we have only a two - fold of physically different solutions , as we claimed above , @xmath102 should be a function of @xmath76 and @xmath103 . indeed , ( [ 12 ] ) together with @xmath104 shows that @xmath77 is a function of @xmath76 and @xmath105 , hence of @xmath76 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , by ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , also @xmath102 depends only on @xmath76 and @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath106 depends on @xmath107 , the result can be conveniently expressed by using planck units , indicated by a subscript p :    @xmath108^{1/4}.     \\label{40}\\ ] ]    to give a numerical example , if we take @xmath103 as the mass of the sun , @xmath76 as the corresponding schwarzschild radius , we obtain @xmath109k .",
    "this would correspond to a very hard gamma radiation with a wavelength @xmath110 m. the temperature of this example is @xmath111k , since @xmath112 whereas @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "it is difficult to assess the physical relevance of our findings .",
    "but one point seems to be clear : the global character of the solutions @xmath115 is completely different from the schwarzschild approximations @xmath116 , no matter how small @xmath22 is .",
    "so the class @xmath21 of solutions of ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) does not depend continuously on @xmath22 in any reasonable sense .",
    "any small amount of radiation will destroy the event horizon , at least if an equilibrium is approached .",
    "if this would also be the case in simulations of the birth of `` black holes '' by collapsing matter , then they would never be born , and perhaps wo nt exist at all .      , _",
