    "a plausible way to extend the standard model is to embed it in one or more extra dimensions .",
    "this opens up a new set of model - building tools which can help to solve a diverse range of theoretical and phenomenological problems , as well as yielding distinct collider signatures such as kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "almost all extra - dimensional models require one or more background scalar fields in some non - trivial configuration .",
    "for example , to generate a domain - wall which localises chiral fermions  @xcite , to stabilise the size of a compact extra dimension  @xcite , to generalise the randall - sundrum warped - space  @xcite to a smoothed - out version  @xcite , or to cut off the extra dimension at a singularity  @xcite .",
    "domain - wall models , whether they have an infinite  @xcite or compact  @xcite extra dimension , make heavy use of background scalar configurations as a field - theoretic substitution for fundamental branes .",
    "given the ubiquity and necessity of background scalar fields , it is important to understand both their statics and dynamics .",
    "the problem is best thought about in terms of a ground state , upon which exist perturbations .",
    "we want to know which particular scalar configurations have the lowest energy and are stable , and what the perturbations about a background lead to in terms of effective 4d modes .",
    "these two issues are closely related .",
    "the existence of negative - mass modes ( tachyonic kk modes ) signals an instability of the corresponding background .",
    "massless modes may also signal an instability  @xcite , or be harmless in the case of a translation mode .",
    "positive - mass modes always exist and their precise spectrum is what distinguishes these extra - dimensional models at a particle collider .    for the case of a single scalar field in a flat compact extra dimension , a general method for determining the lowest energy configuration has been worked out  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of gravity in the analysis presents some complications because of the coupling of the scalar fields to gravity .",
    "this coupling generically warps the extra dimension  @xcite and the scalar perturbations mix with the spin-0 degrees of freedom in the metric . for this warped case with one extra dimension",
    "there have been some general stability analyses with a single background scalar  @xcite , and some initial work on the multiple scalar case  @xcite . for the case of a single scalar in multiple extra dimensions",
    "it has also been shown that the scalar and metric spin-0 modes mix  @xcite .",
    "related analyses determining the spin-0 spectrum of multiple scalars in 5d have been done in the context of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an algorithm for computing the scalar spectrum in general 5d compact models has been prescribed  @xcite .    despite the complications introduced by gravity ,",
    "it is still possible to find the effective coupled schrdinger equations which describe the kk modes of multiple scalars in a warped background  @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the current paper to , when possible , formally solve this set of schrdinger equations for the massless kk modes   the zero modes   in the case of a 5d bulk with no gravity ( flat ) and with gravity ( warped ) .",
    "in addition to providing closed form solutions for the zero modes for a large number of cases , we shall also discuss how these solutions can be used to determine if any normalisable zero modes exist and whether or not the background is perturbatively stable . some relevant examples shall be provided .",
    "one reason for studying the zero modes of the system is that , if they exist , they should play a large role at low energies in the effective 4d theory .",
    "for example , zero modes of a 5d fermion are generally used to implement the fermions of the standard model  @xcite . when constructing domain - wall models using scalar background fields in flat space , one always obtains a spin-0 zero mode corresponding to the broken translation symmetry .",
    "this degree of freedom is not welcome in the effective 4d theory since we have never observed such a particle , which would manifest as a `` fifth force '' . adding warped gravity can cure this problem since this removes the translation zero mode , as shown by shaposhnikov et .",

    "this result is extended to the case of multiple background scalar fields : the zero mode of translation does not survive , no matter how many scalars .",
    "it is possible though , and we shall give some explicit examples , that additional scalars introduce additional zero modes which do survive in the presence of gravity .",
    "our examples of such models are constructed using the superpotential approach , and we argue that these models are phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : zm ] we first present the zero mode solutions , for the flat and warped cases , with general potential @xmath0 and also specialising to a superpotential @xmath1 with @xmath2 scalars . for this latter case",
    "we give all four independent zero modes in closed analytic form .",
    "section  [ sec : use - of - zm ] discusses the construction of a solution matrix , and how its eigenvalues can be used to find normalisable zero modes , and count the number of normalisable negative modes . following this we look in sections  [ sec : dw ] and  [ sec : sw ] at specific domain - wall models in both an infinite and a compact extra dimension , and",

    "since we have @xmath3 second order , linear , ordinary differential equations ( odes ) we expect to obtain @xmath15 linearly independent solutions .",
    "these @xmath15 solutions are not necessarily physical ( that is , are not normalisable ) , but they do form a basis from which one can construct the unique solution for any given initial , boundary and/or normalisability conditions .",

    "this can be accomplished by using the closed form expressions for the zero modes in the previous section , or by directly integrating the coupled odes describing the perturbations . in the former case",
    "the integration constants in the closed form solutions must be chosen to achieve the correct initial conditions . in the latter case",
    "the initial conditions in @xmath168 can be used directly as initial conditions in , for example , a numerical ode solver .",

    "conversely , if a normalisable zero mode is known to exist , then one can find the vector @xmath187 such that @xmath191 at @xmath192 , and so @xmath82 has an eigenvalue function which vanishes at the boundary .",
    "for the second conjecture we do not provide a proof .",
    "it is based on a closely related theorem given by amann and quittner  @xcite .",
    "they work with a system of coupled radial schrdinger equations and the wavefunction values must all vanish at the origin ; effectively they are looking only for solutions where all wavefunctions are odd .",
    "their proof should be adaptable to our second conjecture stated above , including correct handling of the weight function @xmath193 in the warped case in equation  .",

    "for example , there may exist a zero mode that both translates and dilates the background , and so has different initial conditions to @xmath119 and is normalisable .",

    "but without some extra input , like a fundamental brane or forced parity , these superpotential models will be phenomenologically unacceptable due to the presence of massless spin-0 degrees of freedom , something which we have not observed in nature .    finally , the general solutions we have found for the fake supergravity scenario with @xmath2 scalars rely only on the metric ansatz   and should have wider applicability than to the domain - wall models that we emphasise here . for example , the inclusion of fundamental brane terms would change only the boundary conditions ; the bulk solutions we have found will remain the same . extending the zero mode solutions to more than one extra dimension may also be possible , following the analysis of  @xcite",

    "any set of linear homogeneous odes which is @xmath274 order can be easily recast as a set of @xmath275 first order differential equations .",
    "we assume this has been done and that the resulting @xmath275 dependent variables @xmath276 , where @xmath277 and @xmath10 is the independent variable , satisfy the equations @xmath278 there is an implicit sum over @xmath20 .",
    "this equation has @xmath275 independent solutions .",
    "if we know @xmath29 of these solutions then we can perform reduction of order on   to obtain a set of @xmath279 coupled first order odes .",
    "we outline this procedure , which follows closely that given in  @xcite .",
    "write equation   as a matrix equation , @xmath280 , where @xmath123 is a vector of length @xmath275 made of the dependent variables .",
    "let @xmath281 be the @xmath282 solution matrix of this ode , such that each column of @xmath281 is an independent solution vector @xmath283 .",
    "it must be that @xmath284 for all @xmath10",
    ". then @xmath281 is known as the fundamental matrix of the set of odes specified by @xmath231 , since @xmath281 determines @xmath231 uniquely by @xmath285 ( the converse is not true since @xmath286 is also a fundamental matrix of @xmath231 ) .",
    "reduction of order then proceeds as follows .",
    "assume we know @xmath29 columns of @xmath281 ( that is , @xmath29 linearly independent solutions of the ode ) which we label @xmath287 with @xmath288 .",
    "then construct the @xmath282 matrix @xmath289 where the @xmath290 , @xmath291 , are linearly independent constant vectors .",
    "they can be freely chosen , so long as @xmath292 for all @xmath10 .",
    "usually the @xmath290 can be unit vectors .",
    "now change variables to @xmath293 by the definition @xmath294 and the equation @xmath295 becomes @xmath296 the first @xmath29 components of the vector @xmath293 do not appear on the right - hand - side of this ode ( after multiplying the matrices out ) , so this procedure decouples @xmath29 of the equations .",
    "call the solutions to equation   @xmath297 .",
    "we know @xmath29 of these are just constant vectors : @xmath298 , @xmath299 and so on to @xmath300 .",
    "the remaining @xmath279 solutions are to be determined using other techniques .",
    "once they are found , the remaining solutions to the original ode are given by @xmath301 ."
