    "achieving quantum degeneracy in ultracold atomic gases by all - optical means becomes a well accepted experimental technique because of several inherent advantages @xcite .",
    "optical traps allow strong confinement resulting in high collision rates and rapid evaporative cooling .",
    "confinement of arbitrary spin states and spin state mixtures are readily obtained .",
    "the possibility to tune interactions via feshbach resonances usually requires optical trapping as they frequently occur in states that can not be trapped magnetically @xcite .",
    "finally , large current coils needed for magnetic - field trapping that restrict optical access are avoided .",
    "the first successful demonstration of an all - optically achieved @xmath7rb bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) allowed significant increase in the rate of bec production and the resulting condensates were f=1 spinors @xcite .",
    "however , the main driving force behind the search for all - optical techniques was the need to condense specific atoms where the conventional evaporation in the magnetic trap was not possible .",
    "two prominent examples are spinless , and thus magnetically untrappable , bec of yb atoms achieved in a doubled yag crossed dipole trap @xcite and a bec of @xmath8cs atoms @xcite for which the strongly enhanced two - body losses from the magnetically trappable states prevent the condensate formation in the standard way @xcite .",
    "although @xmath0li atoms can be evaporatively cooled in a magnetic trap @xcite , the task remains challenging due to several reasons .",
    "first , @xmath0li atoms posses a relatively small scattering length ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bohr radius ) and high two - body loss rate @xcite .",
    "second , the initial phase space density is unfavorably limited by the absence of polarization - gradient cooling mechanism .",
    "third , since the scattering length drops with increased temperature and crosses zero at @xmath11 mk @xcite , the use of adiabatic compression to increase the elastic collisional rate is ineffective .",
    "therefore , the strong magnetic confinement needed to keep evaporation time comparable with heavier alkalies , such as rb and na , requires the design of a miniaturized trap .",
    "this is done by either a small - volume vacuum chamber and high currents @xcite or a vacuum compatible minitrap @xcite which both increase the experimental complexity . finally , even if the strong confinement is achieved the scattering length is still negative which prevents the formation of a stable bec .    in this paper",
    "we show an all - optical way to condense @xmath0li atoms using tunable interatomic interactions .",
    "we use a 100 w ytterbium fiber laser to produce @xmath122 mk potential well which traps @xmath1210@xmath13 atoms from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "we explore two new feshabach resonances on @xmath14 state and find that one of them is favorable for the efficient forced evaporation starting directly from the phase space density achieved in the mot .",
    "we obtain a bec on @xmath14 internal state in less than 3 s of evaporation time .",
    "the @xmath0li atoms route to quantum degeneracy starts in an oven where they are heated up to @xmath15c to increase their vapor pressure .",
    "an atomic beam is collimated by two distant apertures and slowed down in an increased magnetic - field zeeman - slower .",
    "the capture velocity of the slower is set to @xmath12800 m / s .",
    "our mot design and parameters are similar to that described in ref @xcite . after a loading time of 3",
    "s , the trap contains @xmath16 atoms at a temperature of @xmath17 mk .",
    "trap life - time , limited by vacuum , is measured to be 10 s. the mot parameters , such as pump and repump detunings and magnetic field gradient , are optimized to maximize the number of atoms . to improve the initial phase space density we implement a so called compressed mot ( cmot ) stage @xcite . for @xmath18",
    "ms the laser intensities are attenuated , detunings are decreased and the magnetic field gradient is increased . as a result",
    "the temperature is reduced to 300 @xmath19k and nearly half of the atoms are lost . by the end of this phase @xmath20 atoms are left in the trap with density of @xmath21 atoms/@xmath22 and phase - space density of @xmath23 .",
    "the realization of the optical - dipole trap is shown in fig .",
    "[ apparatus ] .",
    "a cw ytterbium fiber laser generates @xmath24 w of linearly polarized light at 1.07 @xmath19 m .",
    "the first order diffraction beam of an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , with @xmath25 diffraction efficiency , is focused at the center of the mot to a waist of 31 @xmath26 .",
    "the zero order diffraction beam is only weakly focused to 300 @xmath19 m and it crosses the first order beam at an angle of 19.5@xmath27 . when maximum rf power is applied to the aom this beam is very weak and it has no effect on the atoms . at full laser power ( 65 w in the trap region )",
    "the trap depth , produced by the first order diffraction beam , is estimated to be @xmath28 mk .",
    "oscillation frequencies in the trap are predicted to be @xmath29 khz and @xmath30 hz for the radial and longitudinal directions , respectively .",
    "the radial oscillation frequency was measured by parametric driving technique and found to be in excellent agreement with the predicted one .",
    "we keep the first order diffraction beam at its full power throughout the mot loading time and atoms are loaded into the dipole trap mainly during the cmot phase .",
    "mechanical shutters are then used to block all resonant light from reaching the trapped atoms .",
    "the mot pump beam , associated with the @xmath31 ground state , is blocked only a few milliseconds later to allow a @xmath32 ms optical pumping pulse , effectively transferring all atoms into the @xmath33 ground state .",
    "eventually , we are left with @xmath34 trapped atoms .",
    "phase - space density conditions are similar to those resulted from the cmot phase .",
    "we note that the loading efficiency of the optical trap from the cmot is rather poor due to the small spatial overlap between the two traps .",
    "even for 100 w laser power the high initial temperature of the @xmath0li atoms oblige tight focusing of the beam in order to create a deep enough potential .",
    "this makes the use of a compressible crossed dipole trap to improve the loading conditions impractical @xcite .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath0li atoms on all sublevels and sublevel mixtures of the @xmath33 ground state at zero magnetic field is positive but very small ( @xmath35 ) , impeding efficient evaporation cooling .",
    "however , each sublevel and their mixtures posses at least one feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the resonance on the absolute ground state @xmath36 has been previously used for the final stage of forced evaporation in an optical trap after precooling in a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "the resonances on other sublevels or their mixtures were neither reported nor used before .",
    "the search for feshbach resonances requires high offset magnetic fields .",
    "we use two pairs of helmholtz coils that allow variable bias fields of up to @xmath37 g. when the magnetic field is ramped up to high values we observe @xmath38 reduction in atom number .",
    "our state selective measurement shows that the remaining atoms are all on @xmath1 state .",
    "we attribute this loss to spin - flip collisions between atoms on @xmath39 and @xmath36 states .",
    "the energy level splitting diagram of the @xmath33 state is shown in fig .",
    "[ li7f1 ] .",
    "a spin - flip collision that takes place at high magnetic fields flips the colliding atoms to @xmath1 state and leaves them with an excess of kinetic energy equal to @xmath40 mk , which is comparable to the trap depth .",
    "most of the atoms escape but we observe some increase in @xmath41 population .",
    "detection of losses and spontaneous spin polarization are the first manifestations of the increase in collisional cross - section .",
    "as @xmath41 state is stable against spin - exchange collisions at high magnetic fields , we search for signatures of feshbach resonances on this state .    fig . [ feshbach](a ) shows a theoretical prediction of the scattering length as a function of bias magnetic field .",
    "two feshbach resonances between @xmath42 g and @xmath43 g are indicated by the divergence of the scattering length .",
    "experimentally , the resonances are usually observed by detection of atom loss as in their proximity the inelastic collisional rate is strongly enhanced @xcite . for this measurement",
    "we ramp up the magnetic field to different values in @xmath44 ms and wait for @xmath45 s before decreasing it to @xmath46 g in @xmath44 ms where _ in situ _ state selective absorption imaging is performed . in fig .",
    "[ feshbach](b ) the atom number as a function of bias magnetic field is shown .",
    "the atoms are initially prepared at a temperature of 300 @xmath19k .",
    "strong losses are observed around @xmath47 g and @xmath48 g featuring a narrow and a broad structures . by fitting them with simple gaussian functions , a coarse estimation of the resonances locations and widths can be determined . according to the fit , the narrow resonance is @xmath2 g wide ( @xmath49 radius ) and it is located at @xmath4 g. the uncertainty in its position is due to an uncertainty in the magnetic field calibration which is obtained by the detection of optical resonances and thus limited by the linewidth of the excited states and the laser locking quality .",
    "the broad resonance located at @xmath5 g is @xmath3 g wide and features a notable asymmetric profile which tends to shift the center of a simple gaussian fit to a higher magnetic field value as compared to the maximal loss position ( detected at 875 g ) .",
    "such an asymmetry in losses in the vicinity of broad feshbach resonances has been recently reported for @xmath50k atoms @xcite and was attributed to larger three - body loss coefficient from the negative scattering length side of the resonance and mean field effects .",
    "the followed study of molecule association showed that the position of a broad feshbach resonance is indeed shifted to a lower value @xcite .",
    "comparison between the experimental measurements ( fig . [ feshbach](b ) ) and the theoretical calculations ( fig .",
    "[ feshbach](a ) ) shows that the maximal loss position suits better the predicted distance between the two resonances .",
    "we therefore believe that the actual location of the broad resonance is at somewhat lower value than that given by the gaussian fit and this systematic error increases the error bars of the experimentally detected resonance position .",
    "most excitingly , we observe an onset of free evaporation cooling together with the enhanced inelastic losses ( fig . [ feshbach](b ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ feshbach](c ) we show the temperature change as a function of the bias magnetic field .",
    "a decrease in the temperature indicates cooling which we attribute to the establishment of free evaporation when the collision rate becomes high enough .",
    "the observed cooling allows us to decrease temperature by forced evaporation and than scan for feshbach resonances again to improve sensitivity .",
    "we execute a short forced evaporation of @xmath51 s reducing the trap depth to @xmath52 mk , @xmath53 of its initial value .",
    "evaporation is performed with a bias field of @xmath54 g which is chosen to optimize number - to - temperature ratio based on our scans for feshbach resonances at high temperature ( fig .",
    "[ feshbach](b , c ) ) . by the end of this evaporation",
    "the atoms are cooled down to a temperature of @xmath1250 @xmath19k .",
    "our scan for inelastic losses in proximity to feshabch resonances reveals the same positions of the resonances observed before including asymmetry in the profile of the broad resonance .",
    "however , an additional feature has been identified which we were unable to detect at high temperature . in fig .",
    "[ zerox ] , zero crossing of the scattering length manifests itself in terms of increased temperature and number of atoms @xcite .",
    "the hold - time at high bias field for this experiment is @xmath45 s. during this time efficient free evaporation reduces the temperature to 40 @xmath19k if collisional cross - section is high enough . at zero",
    "crossing the scattering length vanishes and so does the cross - section , impeding efficient free evaporation .",
    "the asymmetry in this measurement is caused by the proximity of the zero crossing point to the narrow resonance at @xmath55 g. the zero - crossing point is detected at @xmath6 g where the maximum temperature is observed .",
    "forced evaporation cooling of the optically trapped atoms down to the bec threshold is performed by attenuating the laser power , thus reducing the trap depth which scales linearly with the power reduction factor @xmath56 .",
    "a photo diode detector , located behind one of the mirrors , collects a fraction of the trap beam s power ( see fig .",
    "[ apparatus ] ) .",
    "it generates a voltage readout that is compared to a setpoint signal by a pid - controller .",
    "an error signal is fed back to the rf - power supplier of the aom . with this scheme",
    "we are able to control trap depth reduction up to a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "as is well known , trap oscillation frequencies also decrease with the attenuation of laser power ( @xmath58 ) , affecting re - thermalization efficiency throughout the evaporation process .",
    "in addition to that , the strong bias magnetic field , employed during evaporation , creates a weak anti - trapping potential in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this decreases further the optical confinement toward the end of the evaporation .",
    "indeed , in a single beam trap we were unable to cool atoms below a temperature of 10 @xmath19k .",
    "the addition of the zero - order diffraction beam solves this problem . at the beginning of the evaporation it has no effect on the atoms as",
    "its potential depth is negligible .",
    "however , with the reduction of the first order diffraction intensity , it strengthen to create a confinement potential to the atoms in the longitudinal direction of the trap .",
    "the longitudinal oscillation frequency , determined by the confining beam , is @xmath59 hz .",
    "the zero order beam can be effectively considered as a two dimensional confining potential because it produces very weak ( @xmath60 hz ) oscillation frequency in its propagation direction which is easily overcome by the magnetic anti - trapping potential .",
    "we note also that the crossed trap is slightly shifted from the location of the zero order beam waist which reduces somewhat the potential at the end of the evaporation .",
    "forced evaporation is found to work most effectively when the bias field is set to @xmath61 g. based on the theoretical curve ( fig . [ feshbach](a ) ) we estimate the scattering length to be @xmath62 .",
    "the large uncertainty in the scattering length is due to the uncertainty in the position of the broad resonance .",
    "the trap depth is reduced exponentially in @xmath63 s with a time constant of @xmath64 ms to less than @xmath65 of its initial value . in fig .",
    "[ bec ] , _ in - situ _ absorption imaging of the trapped atoms at @xmath61 g reveals the on - set of a bec threshold by a familiar bi - modal density distribution .",
    "the trace represents the atom longitudinal density after integrating the radial direction of the picture above it .",
    "optical resolution is 4 @xmath19 m , less than the size of the bec .",
    "the thermal atomic cloud is fitted with a bose - einstein distribution function which reveals a temperature of @xmath66 nk .",
    "the total number of atoms is @xmath67 which sets the critical temperature to @xmath68 nk .",
    "the fitting of the bec with the inverted parabola of a thomas - fermi limit reveals @xmath69 atoms in the condensate .",
    "to conclude , we developed a method to all - optically condense @xmath70li atoms .",
    "this way facilitates the bec production which is extremely demanding in magnetic traps .",
    "we observed a bec with repulsive interactions on @xmath1 state in less than @xmath63 s of forced evaporation in a crossed beam optical dipole trap .",
    "we use the tunability of the interatomic interactions in the proximity of feshbach resonances which we observed and characterized for this internal state .",
    "we note that the condensate life - time was very short , presumably because of the extremely large scattering length .",
    "moreover , our weak optical trap at the end of the evaporation was not stable enough due to the use of a single linear photo diode detector .",
    "a number of improvements can be implemented to optimize the performance of the described method .",
    "better laser beam stability , which can be achieved by using either two detectors @xcite or a logarithmic detector , and decrease of the scattering length toward the end of evaporation will improve the condensate lifetime .",
    "improved vacuum would allow an increase in the number of atoms in the condensate .",
