    "on microscopic and mesoscopic scales , plastic deformation of crystalline solids proceeds as an intermittent series of strain bursts ( slip avalanches ) .",
    "indirect evidence of such bursts has been provided by systematic acoustic emission ( ae ) studies of weiss and co - workers on ice @xcite , hcp metals @xcite , and fcc metals @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that the ae signals of plastically deforming crystals consist of discrete bursts separated by quiescent intervals of low ae activity .",
    "the energies @xmath6 ( amplitude square integrated over the duration of a burst ) and peak amplitudes @xmath7 of the ae bursts exhibit a huge scatter ; their statistics is characterized by scale - free ( power law ) distributions , with probability density functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 that are well described as power laws with material - independent exponents @xmath10 and @xmath11 , extending over up to 8 decades with no apparent cut - off .",
    "dimiduk and co - workers confirmed temporal intermittency of plastic flow by direct observation of strain bursts during compressive deformation of micropillars machined out of ni single crystals @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the elongation vs. time curves observed under stress - controlled loading were characterized by an intermittent sequence of deformation jumps , with elongation increments @xmath12 that exhibited a scale - free distribution @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "recently , ngan observed bursts with similar statistical characteristics in creep deformation of aluminum micropillars under constant stress conditions @xcite .",
    "these findings can be directly related to the acoustic emission results if one assumes that a fixed fraction of the work done by the external forces during an elongation jump is released in the form of acoustic energy .",
    "theoretically , the formation of intermittent deformation bursts has been modelled using two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite discrete dislocation dynamics simulations , as well as various types of continuum models @xcite . in the discrete simulations ,",
    "the stochastic nature of the deformation process is directly inherited from the statistical choice of the initial dislocation configuration , which in turn reflects the variability of the initial microstructure of real specimens . in the continuum models ,",
    "statistical heterogeneity needs to be explicitly incorporated into the constitutive equations , e.g. in terms of fluctuations in the local flow stresses or energy dissipation rates . while less realistic than discrete dislocation simulations , such models provide a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of the scale - free avalanche dynamics which can be related to a depinning - like transition between an elastic and a plastically deforming phase ( ` yielding transition ' ) .",
    "a comprehensive overview of experimental and theoretical results has been given by zaiser @xcite .    in spite of all these investigations ,",
    "open questions remain .",
    "the relations between different characteristics of strain bursts , such as the associated strain or elongation increments , the burst durations and the peak strain rates , have remained largely unexplored .",
    "other open issues concern the statistics of stress increments between bursts and the correlation between stress increments and burst sizes .",
    "furthermore , practically all the experimental evidence has been gathered on materials ( fcc and hcp metals , ice close to its melting point ) where the motion of dislocations is governed by their mutual interactions .",
    "molybdenum ( mo ) , on the other hand , is a bcc metal where dislocation interactions with the crystal lattice ( peierls stresses ) may have a crucial influence on the deformation behavior : below the so - called knee temperature ( @xmath15 500 - 550 k for mo @xcite ) , the plastic deformation of bulk bcc metals is controlled by the nucleation and motion of kinks on screw dislocations .",
    "these materials exhibit therefore a strong temperature and strain - rate dependence of the flow stress ( for a detailed overview of the deformation behavior of bcc metals , see @xcite ) .",
    "since the motion of dislocations is at low temperatures governed by their interactions with the crystal lattice , it has been argued that collective behavior , and hence strain bursts , may be suppressed in this temperature regime @xcite .    in the present paper , we adress these open questions by investigating strain bursts observed in molybdenum ( mo ) micropillars that are deformed at room temperature in compression under load control . in the following sections we first describe the experimental procedure and the methods used for characterizing the strain bursts .",
    "we then discuss the results of our analysis in view of the statistics of burst sizes and stress increments , and the relations between burst strain and peak strain rate .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of our findings with theoretical and experimental results on strain bursts in other materials .",
    "zone refined mo single crystals were oriented using laue diffraction , and disk - shaped samples of approximately 3 mm height and 10 mm diameter with disk normals pointing along [ 100 ] and [ 235 ] lattice directions were cut by spark erosion .",
    "the disk surfaces were then mechanically polished using 6 , 3 and 1 @xmath16 m diamond suspensions and subsequently electro - polished for 60 seconds using a mixture of 610 ml methanol and 85 ml h@xmath17so@xmath18 at a current of 1 - 2 amperes .",
    "the samples were mounted on a custom machined aluminum holder for testing , and their orientation was confirmed by electron backscatter diffraction .",
    "the specific process used in fabricating micropillars from the oriented samples is very similar to the method of frick et al .",
    "free - standing pillars of tapered shape were fabricated using a dual focused ion beam ( fib ) and scanning electron microscope ( sem ) ( fei nova 600 nanolab dualbeam@xmath19 ) .",
    "the as - machined pillars were deformed in compression at ambient pressure and temperature by using a mts xp nanoindenter system equipped with a sapphire conical indenter with a flat 10 @xmath16 m diameter tip .",
    "the loading rates varied between 4 and 60 @xmath16n / sec , depending on pillar diameter .",
    "geometrical parameters ( top diameter @xmath20 , bottom diameter @xmath21 , and length @xmath22 of the analysed pillars ) and loading rates are compiled in table 1 .",
    "deformation experiments were performed at a control rate of 500 hz with a data storage rate of 25 hz , i.e. , data were recorded at intervals @xmath23 s. tests were typically performed with two intermediate unloading and reloading cycles at about 2.5% and 5% strain in order to observe the linear elastic response and transient loading / unloading behavior of the pillars .",
    "the intermediate unloading may influence the strain burst statistics : most of the deformation occurs during the largest bursts ( see figure [ stresstrain ] ) and it is thus very likely that these are truncated by unloading ( in fact , sometimes the burst continued during unloading or burstlike deformation resumed at a reduced stress level upon reloading ) . therefore , a set of [ 100 ] oriented pillars ( labelled with the subscript nr in table 1 ) were deformed without intermediate unloading . analysing these",
    "separately allows us to assess the influence of unloading on the burst statistics .",
    "oriented mo micropillars @xcite ( specimens 2@xmath24 , 5@xmath24 , 6@xmath24 , 7@xmath24 , 9@xmath24 , and 10@xmath24 in table 1 ) . ]",
    "the flow stresses of the investigated samples increase with decreasing sample size .",
    "a study of this size effect has been published elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", we focus exclusively on the intermittent nature of the deformation process .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ stresstrain ] , the deformation curves are characterized by an irregular sequence of large strain bursts visible as steps on the stress vs. strain or elongation vs. time curves . during the bursts , which typically lasted less than a second",
    ", deformation rates were high ( peak strain rates @xmath25 1 s@xmath26 ) .",
    "the elongation rate signals have the typical signature of a crackling noise ( figure [ strainrate ] ) @xcite , i.e. , they are composed of discrete bursts of widely varying magnitude .     oriented mo micropillar ( specimen 10@xmath24 , lowermost curve in figure 1 ) . ]",
    "strain bursts were characterized in terms of their size ( defined as the elongation increment between the beginning and the end of the burst ) , duration , and peak elongation rate . to define a burst , the elongation vs. time signals @xmath27",
    "were first conditioned by performing a running average over an averaging time interval @xmath28 .",
    "this served to eliminate high - frequency noise resulting from the deformation setup .",
    "the averaged signals @xmath29 were then differentiated using a simple central difference scheme , and the resulting elongation rate signals @xmath30 were broken into bursts by thresholding : a strain burst was associated with a time interval @xmath31 $ ] such that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and for @xmath36 .",
    "the burst duration was then defined as @xmath37 , the burst elongation as @xmath38 , the time - averaged peak elongation rate as @xmath39 $ ] for @xmath33 $ ] , and the true peak elongation rate as @xmath40 $ ] for @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the burst initiation stress was defined as @xmath41 , and the stress increment as @xmath42 . on some rare occasions ,",
    "bursts occurred during intermediate unloading or reloading , leading to negative stress increments .",
    "these bursts were discarded from the stress increment statistics .    in our analysis",
    "we used the standard parameters @xmath43 s and @xmath44 nm / s .",
    "for these parameters , a typical specimen of @xmath45 m diameter yielded between 50 and 100 bursts , most of them small .",
    "since this is not sufficient for a meaningful statistical analysis , we grouped specimens of the same orientation into size classes with typically 6 - 8 specimens in each class . those [ 100 ] specimens that were deformed without intermediate stress relaxation are grouped separately such that the influence of intermediate unloading on the strain burst statistics can be assessed .",
    "the class partition is shown in table 1 .",
    "for the bursts obtained from all specimens in a given class , probability distributions @xmath46 were determined by logarithmically binning the @xmath47 data .",
    "this is appropriate for power - law distributed data where logarithmic binning may significantly improve the statistics in the regime of large events without introducing spurious cut - off effects .",
    "stress increments , on the other hand , were found to be weibull distributed . in this case , since the data scatter around a characteristic value , logarithmic binning makes little sense .",
    "instead , we base our statistical analysis on the cumulative distribution @xmath48 as determined from the ordered sequence of the @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total number of stress increments and @xmath52 the @xmath53th member in the descending sequence .    to ensure that the burst statistics do not significantly depend on the signal conditioning and thresholding parameters @xmath28 and @xmath54",
    ", we performed a systematic parameter study by varying these parameters in the ranges @xmath55 s @xmath56 s and @xmath57 nm / s @xmath58 nm / s , and studying the corresponding changes in the @xmath46 probability distribution for small [ 100 ] oriented pillars ( class [ 100]s , table 1 ) .",
    "we first investigate to which extent the statistics of strain burst sizes is influenced by the parameters used for smoothing and thresholding the raw elongation rate signals .",
    "figure [ windows ] shows distributions obtained for small [ 100 ] crystals using three different sizes of the averaging window . for short averaging windows , the distribution of burst sizes exhibits two distinct regimes : at small burst sizes , the burst size distribution has a hump which decays exponentially , whereas at large sizes , the exponential decay is replaced by a power - law tail .",
    "we may associate these two regimes with two different physical processes , _",
    "viz _ on the one hand the high - frequency noise of the deformation setup which produces a large number of small bursts  in fact , just irregular oscillations of the deformation machine  and on the other hand the collective dynamics of the dislocation system which produces intermittent large bursts of plastic deformation activity with a power - law size distribution .",
    "what is important is that the high - frequency noise of the machine does not mask the power - law scaling since the amplitude of the machine - induced elongation fluctuations is limited to values less than 1 nm . by increasing the length of the averaging window , we can suppress this exponential hump while the power - law part of the distribution remains unchanged  in fact , the length of the scaling regime increases and reaches a maximum at a window length of 0.8 s which we choose as our default value . if the original signal is averaged over even larger times , the size distribution of large bursts remains unchanged but the length of the scaling regime decreases again since smaller bursts are washed out as their peak elongation rates fall below the threshold .",
    "oriented mo micropillars ( class [ 100]s in table 1 ) , determined with an elongation rate threshold of 0.02 nm / s and different sizes of the averaging window ; full line : fit function @xmath59 + 0.05 x^{-1.5}$ ] ]    figure [ thresholds ] shows the dependence of the burst size distribution on the imposed elongation rate threshold . for small thresholds ,",
    "the distribution is practically independent on threshold , while a threshold substantially above our default value of 0.5 nm / s eliminates small bursts but leaves the size distribution of large bursts practically unchanged .",
    "crucially , neither the size of the averaging window nor the choice of the threshold seem to have any appreciable influence on the power - law scaling of the burst size distribution in the large - burst regime ( elongation increments larger than approximately 1 nm ) .",
    "this robustness of the procedure indicates that it is indeed viable to envisage our elongation rate signals as crackling noise composed of discrete events",
    ".     oriented mo micropillars ( class [ 100]s in table 1 ) , determined with different threshold values of the elongation rate and a window size of 0.8 s. ]    probability distributions of strain burst sizes for the different specimen classes are shown in figure [ psall ] ( left ) .",
    "all distributions can with reasonable accuracy be described as power laws : @xmath60 least - square fits to the logarithmically binned data yield values of @xmath61 , and compiling bursts from all specimens and determining the overall size distribution as shown in the inset of figure [ psall ] ( left ) yields @xmath62 .",
    "no systematic dependency of the exponent @xmath63 on pillar orientation or pillar size can be detected . even though intermediate unloading is expected to truncate some of the largest bursts , [ 100 ] oriented specimens deformed without unloading",
    "do not exhibit larger bursts than those from the other groups - if anything , the above average exponent @xmath64 for the [ 100]nr class suggests the opposite .",
    "differences between the distributions obtained for different specimen classes should not be over - interpreted  they may simply reflect statistical scatter inherent in the not very large size of the datasets which comprise typically some 400 bursts for each specimen class . to illustrate this point",
    ", we show on the right - hand side of figure [ psall ] simulated @xmath46 distributions determined from 6 sets of surrogate data , each consisting of 400 random numbers drawn independently from a distribution @xmath65 .",
    "as can be seen , the scatter of the exponents determined from these sets , the scatter in the data ranges , and the error of the linear least - square fits are all comparable with the corresponding values for the experimental datasets .",
    "this illustrates the intrinsic problems encountered in determining distribution parameters from limited sets of data .",
    "values for each class ; inset : aggregated distribution of burst sizes from all classes ; right : surrogate data ( distributions determined from sets of 400 random numbers @xmath66 drawn from a distribution @xmath65 with @xmath67 ) ; full lines : @xmath68 . ]",
    "we now proceed to investigate other burst characteristics , _ viz _ the burst durations and peak elongation rates .",
    "unfortunately , the intrinsic burst durations may be well below the size @xmath28 of our averaging window . as a consequence , all large bursts determined from the averaged elongation rate signal have approximately the same duration which is roughly proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the burst durations as determined from the averaged signals are no longer good characterizers of the bursts and , for evident reasons , the same is true for the peak rates of the time - averaged signals which decrease with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the true peak elongation rate @xmath69 , on the other hand , represents an intrinsic property of the bursts that is not affected by time averaging .",
    "there is a strong statistical correlation between @xmath69 and burst size @xmath66 ( correlation coefficient @xmath70 ) but it it is not easy to establish a clear - cut mathematical relation between the two quantities .",
    "this is seen from figure [ sizerate ] which shows @xmath69 vs. @xmath66 values for all large bursts .",
    "while part of the observed bursts seem to exhibit peak rates that are approximately proportional to the burst sizes ( @xmath71 , upper straight line in figure [ sizerate ] ) , other data seem to suggest a proportionality to the square root of the burst sizes @xmath72 , lower straight line in figure [ sizerate ] ) .",
    "fitting a power law to all the data yields @xmath73 which badly represents either group .",
    "interpretation of these findings is further complicated by the fact that the two behaviors do not represent different specimen classes  rather , bursts from one and the same specimen may be found both near the upper and the lower straight lines .     and true peak elongation rate @xmath69 ; upper straight line : @xmath74 , lower straight line : @xmath72 .",
    "]    to assess the degree of correlation between the burst size and the magnitude of the preceding and following stress increments , the respective correlation coefficients were evaluated separately for the 6 datasets in class [ 100]s , and the mean correlation coefficient as well as the variance of the @xmath75 values were determined . the results ( @xmath76 for the correlation coefficient between burst size and magnitude of the preceding stress increment , and @xmath77 for",
    "the correlation between burst size and magnitude of the following stress increment ) do not indicate any statistically significant correlation .",
    "there is also no statistically significant correlation between the sizes of successive bursts ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the statistics of stress increments differs substantially from the statistics of burst sizes : instead of scale - free power laws we find distributions with a characteristic scale that depends on specimen size .",
    "figure [ stressinc ] shows cumulative distributions @xmath79 ( probability to find a stress increment larger than @xmath80 ) for the specimen classes [ 100]s , [ 100]m , [ 100]l , and [ 100]xl .",
    "the data can be well fitted by weibull distributions , @xmath81\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the weibull modulus and the stress parameter @xmath83 defines the characteristic stress increment .",
    "parameters for the distributions are shown in the legend ; the weibull modulus @xmath82 which determines the width of the distribution is approximately the same for all distributions , but the stress parameter decreases with increasing specimen size .",
    "s , [ 100]m , [ 100]l , and [ 100]xl ; full lines : weibull fits , for parameters see inset in figure . ]",
    "this is further illustrated in figure [ weibull ] where parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 of stress increment distributions obtained from individual specimens are plotted against specimen size .",
    "it is clearly seen that the weibull moduli @xmath84 do not depend significantly on specimen size , whereas the stress parameters @xmath83 ( and , accordingly , the average stress increments between bursts ) decrease approximately in inverse proportion with specimen diameter @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that , in larger specimens , smaller stress increments are needed to trigger strain bursts  an obvious result since in larger specimens we expect to find a larger number of weak regions or sources that can be activated in any given stress interval .",
    "a more quantitative analysis is , however , hampered by the fact that the characteristic stress increments depend on the averaging and thresholding parameters used in our data analysis : shorter averaging times @xmath28 and smaller threshold values @xmath54 lead to the identification of a larger number of small bursts and a proportional reduction of the characteristic stress increment @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , without a method to clearly distinguish between machine - induced noise and the smaller bursts that result from collective dislocation motion , it is difficult to draw quantitative conclusions from the observed size dependence of the @xmath85 distributions .",
    "[ 100]s , @xmath86 [ 100]m , @xmath87 [ 100]l , @xmath88 [ 100]xl ) ; open symbols : weibull moduli ; cross - center symbols : stress parameters . ]",
    "our investigation provides an example of plasticity behaving as a crackling noise @xcite , with intermittent bursts of activity characterized by scale - free size distributions . for the burst sizes ( elongation increments )",
    "we find a distribution @xmath65 which is in line with experimental findings on ni micropillars @xcite as well as theoretical predictions based on continuum and discrete dislocation models @xcite . the same theoretical models predict power - law relationships @xmath89 to hold between the peak rate , duration , and size of strain bursts .",
    "unfortunately , owing to the need for conditioning the signal by time averaging , no useful information about the burst durations could be obtained in the present investigation , while the information regarding the relationship between burst size and peak elongation rate turned was found to be ambiguous .    in line with previous investigations ,",
    "the power - law characteristics of strain bursts seem to be little affected by specimen orientation , size , or imposed deformation rate .",
    "while theoretical investigations @xcite suggest an intrinsic cut - off to the power - law scaling regime , no such cut - off could be identified in our investigation .",
    "this may be due to the fact that establishing a cut - off requires good statistics in the region of very large strain bursts , which could not be achieved in the present investigation as the total number of bursts obtained from each individual specimen was small ( @xmath90 100 ) .",
    "the distributions of stress increments between subsequent strain bursts differ substantially from the burst size distributions . instead of scale - free power laws , we find weibull distributions with a characteristic stress scale ( the stress parameter @xmath83 ) that decreases approximately in inverse proportion with specimen size .",
    "however , the very presence of a characteristic scale makes the distribution parameters depend on the number of identified bursts .",
    "this dependency raises the problem of distinguishing between the effects of collective dislocation motion and the effects of machine noise , which may increase the apparent burst number by adding spurious bursts of small size into the statistics . for the same reason ,",
    "any conclusions based upon the observed lack of correlation between burst sizes and strain increments , or between the sizes of subsequent bursts , must be regarded with caution .",
    "our investigation demonstrates for the first time the occurrence of scale - free strain bursts in a bcc metal deforming below the transition temperature , and we find that the burst characteristics are similar to those in fcc metals .",
    "this implies that even a significant peierls stress , which is of crucial importance for the deformation properties of bulk mo at ambient tempeature , is not sufficient to inhibit burst - like deformation . in this sense",
    ", we may conclude that the peierls potential is irrelevant as far as the dynamics and statistics of strain bursts are concerned , and that the observed behaviour constitutes a truly universal feature of dislocation plasticity that can be observed in all kinds of crystal lattice structures .",
    "it may be mentioned that the same is not true for the size dependence of the flow stress : the size effects observed in fcc micropillars ( for reference , see , e.g. @xcite ) differ substantially from those observed in the present samples @xcite .",
    "the universality of strain burst behavior is a key result of the present study , and it would be desirable to obtain further corroboration of this result from acoustic emission measurements on bulk bcc metals ."
