    "accurate distance measurement is central to both astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "reliable distances are needed to convert observed properties of galaxies ( fluxes and angular sizes ) into absolute physical quantities such as luminosities , masses , ages , star formation rates , and dynamical time scales . in the local universe where peculiar velocities are significant ,",
    "the distance estimate is often a major source of uncertainty on these physical properties .",
    "for instance , a recent review article on supermassive black holes ( kormendy & ho 2013 ) notes that for many galaxies , the errors in the central black hole masses are dominated by the uncertainty in distance ; yet , many authors neglect to include this important contribution to the uncertainty .    in the field of cosmology",
    ", the acceleration of the cosmic expansion was first revealed by accurate distance measurements of type  ia supernovae ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the supernova distance estimates , combined with flatness constraints for the universe provided by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum , are primarily responsible for inaugurating a new era of `` precision cosmology , '' central to which is the conclusion that the mass - energy budget of the universe is dominated by `` dark energy . '' now , with the exquisite constraints on the cmb power spectrum at @xmath4 ( e.g. , bennett et al .",
    "2013 ; planck collaboration 2015 ) and measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale at intermediate redshift ( e.g. , eisenstein et al .  2005 ;",
    "blake et al .  2011 ) , there has been a new effort to determine the local value of the hubble constant @xmath5  to a precision of 1% ( riess et al .  2011 ; freedman et al .",
    "as discussed in the foregoing references , this level of precision is required for firm simultaneous constraints on cosmic geometry , the dark energy equation of state , and the number of neutrino species .    of course",
    ", the value of @xmath5  has been controversial for decades , primarily owing to systematic calibration errors ( e.g. , freedman & madore 2010 ) .",
    "determining @xmath5  with a total uncertainty of no more than 1% remains beyond the ability of any single distance measurement technique . in order to achieve the required level of precision , it is helpful to have multiple high - precision distance indicators to provide robust constraints on the contributions from systematic errors .",
    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method provides a measurement of the mean brightness of the red giant branch stars in an early - type galaxy even though individual stars can not be resolved ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "it was introduced as a way to estimate distances with @xmath6% uncertainty out to about 20  mpc from ground - based astronomical images ( see tonry et al .",
    "more recent applications have shown substantial improvements in both the precision of the method and depth to which it can be applied ( see the reviews by blakeslee 2012 and fritz 2012 ) , so that it has become one of a small number of methods capable of making a significant contribution to the problem of constraining @xmath5  to  1% . in the following sections , we discuss these recent developments with the method and the need for a new calibration at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the latest revolution in our knowledge of the extragalactic distance scale ( decreasing the uncertainty from nearly a factor of two to less than 10% ) has resulted primarily from observations made with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . starting in the mid-1990s , _ hst _  was used to measure light curves for samples of cepheid variable stars in late - type galaxies out to @xmath7  mpc , mostly as part of the key project on the distance scale ( e.g. , freedman et al .",
    "1994 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "1996 ; kelson et al .  1996 ; saha et al .  1996 , 1997 ;",

    "the resulting cepheid distance estimates were used to calibrate various secondary distance indicators and thereby derive the value of the hubble constant @xmath5(ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ; gibson et al .  2000 ; sakai et al .",
    "2000 ; mould et al .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath5  from the key project was @xmath8  kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9   ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) where the total uncertainty includes both random and systematic contributions .",
    "more recent cepheid - based estimates are very similar to this value , but with reduced uncertainties of 3 to 4% ( riess et al .",
    "2011 ; freedman et al .  2012 ; sorce et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the excellent angular resolution and photometric stability of _ hst _  has also made it possible to measure sbf with far better precision and to much larger distances than was possible from the ground .",
    "for instance , jensen et al .  ( 2001 ) calibrated the sbf method for the near - ir f160w bandpass of the nic2 camera on _ hst _  ( thompson et al .  1999 ) and measured sbf distances to 16 galaxies beyond 40  mpc , including the first sbf distances reaching beyond 100  mpc .",
    "stellar population effects on the nicmos f160w sbf magnitudes were explored in detail by jensen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using a larger sample of 65 galaxies . in general",
    ", the sbf absolute magnitude in a given bandpass depends on stellar population and must be calibrated using a population indicator , typically a broadband color .    following the installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ ,",
    "mei et al .  ( 2005b ) produced the first calibration of the sbf method for the acs wide field channel ( acs / wfc ) using f475w ( g_475@xmath10 ) and f850lp ( z_850@xmath11 ) data for 84 galaxies from the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ; ct et al .",
    "2004 ) . in that work ,",
    "the z_850@xmath11  sbf measurements were calibrated for stellar population variations based on the observed @xmath2  color ; the resulting distances enabled the first clear resolution of the depth of the virgo cluster and provided constraints on its triaxial structure ( mei et al .",
    "in other studies based on acs / wfc observations , cantiello et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 ) measured multi - band sbf and color gradients in 21 galaxies , and biscardi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) made the first optical sbf measurements beyond 100  mpc .",
    "as part of the acs fornax cluster survey ( acsfcs ; jordn et al .",
    "2007 ) , blakeslee et al .  ( 2009 ) refined the sbf calibration for the acs f850lp bandpass and determined the relative distance of the virgo and fornax clusters to a precision of 1.7% .",
    "additional acs / wfc sbf measurements and a new calibration for the f814w bandpass were published by blakeslee et al .",
    "the launch of wide field camera  3 with its powerful ir channel ( wfc3/ir ) has greatly increased the distance to which sbf measurements can be made within a single _ hst _  orbit .",
    "however , the method must first be calibrated for selected wfc3/ir passbands as done previously for nicmos and acs ; this is the primary goal of the present work .",
    "the development of new infrared detectors in the 1990s allowed researchers to successfully apply the sbf techniques to ir images for the first time ( luppino & tonry 1993 ; pahre & mould 1994 ; jensen , luppino , & tonry 1996 ) . because the sbf signal is dominated by the most luminous stars in a population , and these tend to be quite red for evolved galaxies , sbf magnitudes are much brighter in the  near - ir than at optical wavelengths .",
    "additionally , extinction by dust ( both in our galaxy and in the target galaxy ) is much lower at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "depending on how it is distributed , dust can either reduce the fluctuation signal ( as for a uniform screen of foreground dust in the galaxy ) , or , more commonly , bias the fluctuation signal towards higher amplitudes and shorter sbf distances , as would occur if dusty regions were clumpy on scales comparable to the size of the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "clumpy dust is often associated with recent star formation , and bright young stars seriously bias sbf measurements as well .",
    "the contrast between the fluctuations and other point - like sources ( globular clusters and background galaxies ) is also higher in the near - ir bands , reducing yet another source of uncertainty in the sbf measurement . while the background in the ir is higher than at optical wavelengths , the increased strength of the sbf signal more than compensates , especially from space , where the thermal background at 1.1 and 1.6  is not significant .",
    "the benefit of the much lower background , combined with the excellent image quality and a very stable psf , usually makes near - ir sbf measurements with _ hst _  much more accurate than measurements from ground - based facilities .    however , the calibration of the sbf magnitudes as a function of stellar population is potentially more complicated in the near - ir .",
    "as noted above , the trend of sbf magnitude with galaxy color is used for calibrating the sbf distance measurements , both at optical and ir wavelengths . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the effects of age and metallicity variations on the sbf calibration relations are largely degenerate , but this degeneracy begins to break down in near - ir , and this can reveal interesting differences in the stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "bluer elliptical and s0 galaxies typically show signs of intermediate - age populations , and the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars associated with those populations produce brighter fluctuations ( jensen et al .",
    "2003 ; mieske , hilker , & infante 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "the stellar population variations may therefore produce more scatter in ir sbf distance calibration , but the brightness of the fluctuations at these wavelengths make them measurable to much larger distances ; thus , it is worth characterizing the behavior and limits of the calibration as well as possible .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a study to calibrate the ir sbf distance measurement technique using new sbf measurements in the f110w ( @xmath0 ) and f160w ( @xmath1 ) bandpasses of wfc3/ir on _ hst_. the calibration sample includes 16 galaxies spanning a wide range in galaxy luminosity and color .",
    "the following section describes the observations and sample in more detail .",
    "section  3 discusses the data reductions and sbf measurements .",
    "new sbf calibrations in @xmath0  and @xmath1  are presented in section  4 , while implications of the sbf measurements for the galaxy stellar populations are discussed in section  5 .",
    "we provide our recommendations for measuring sbf distances with wfc3/ir in section  6 , before concluding with a summary .",
    "in order to calibrate the sbf method for wfc3/ir , we selected 16 early - type galaxies , eight in each of the virgo and fornax clusters , that already had high - quality acs sbf measurements in z_850@xmath11  and @xmath2  colors ( blakeslee et al .",
    "table  [ tab : props ] lists the properties of the galaxies that were targeted in _",
    "hst _  program go-11712 ( pi : j.  blakeslee ) .",
    "the galaxies were chosen to cover the full color range of the acsvcs and acsfcs samples so that the resulting calibration would be as generally applicable as possible . moreover , the nicmos sbf calibration exhibited increased scatter for bluer galaxies ( jensen et al .",
    "2003 ) , as have ground - based @xmath12-band sbf measurements ( mieske et al .",
    "2006 ) ; exploring a broad color range should help us understand where the wfc3/ir calibration becomes less reliable .",

    "the spatial fluctuations in the surface brightness of a smoothly distributed population of stars , as found in elliptical and lenticular galaxies , arise due to the poisson statistics of the discrete stars making up the galaxy , even when the stars can not be resolved or detected individually ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "the sbf amplitude scales inversely with the square of the distance : nearby galaxies appear `` bumpy '' compared to more distant galaxies , where more stars are sampled by each resolution element and the @xmath15 variation between regions is therefore a smaller fraction of the total number of stars .",
    "the fluctuations , which are dominated by the most luminous stars in a population , are blurred by the psf ; additional contributions to the fluctuation signal arise from clumpy dust , globular clusters , background galaxies , and foreground stars .",
    "the process of making an sbf measurement consists of extracting and fitting the spatial fourier power spectrum of the stellar fluctuations convolved with the psf power spectrum and removing the contributions from extraneous sources .",
    "the resulting fluctuation power is used to compute the fluctuation magnitude .",
    "procedures for measuring surface brightness fluctuations have been described in detail by several authors ( e.g. , tonry et al .  1990 , 1997 ; blakeslee et al .",

    "the description here provides a concise overview of the process steps that are either unique to this study or are particularly relevant to the wfc3/ir sbf measurements .",
    "the first step in the sbf data reduction process involves producing a calibrated , combined , and background - subtracted image ready for further sbf analysis .",
    "we used the images from the _ hst _  archive reduced using the standard pipeline through the flat - fielding stage ( _ flt _ files ) . from that point , we adopted a reduction procedure that differs from the standard pipeline .",
    "we combined the individual flat - fielded exposures using integer pixel shifts after fitting each image for background and identifying cosmic rays ; in order to avoid introducing correlated noise between pixels , fractional pixel registration was _ not _ used . using integer pixel shifts results in slightly lower spatial resolution in the combined image , but preserves the independence of noise from pixel to pixel , which is important for fitting the sbf power spectrum .    in a second difference from the standard pipeline reduction ,",
    "the clean combined images were _ not _ corrected for the wfc3/ir geometrical distortion nor combined using _",
    "our analysis therefore includes the @xmath1610% difference in plate scale between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 axes , causing our images to appear somewhat narrower horizontally than they do on the sky ( fig .",
    "[ imagefigure ] ) .",
    "the sbf procedure involves taking the spatial fourier power spectrum , and correlated noise between pixels resulting from fractional pixel shifts and interpolated pixel values when correcting for geometrical distortion can produce a slope in the white noise component of the power spectrum .    finally , we chose not to apply the correction to pixel size in the @xmath18-axis of wfc3/ir images .",
    "the pixel map correction usually used for wfc3/ir corrects for psf variations but is inappropriate for extended objects .",
    "the wfc3/ir focal plane is tilted , and the size ( area ) of the pixels on the sky varies by @xmath19% from the center to the upper and lower edges of the frame ( kalirai et al .",
    "2010 ) . when the data are divided by the flat field image ( as is done for the _ flt _ files in the _ hst _  archive ) , the varying pixel sensitivity is removed , effectively making the pixels equally sensitive to uniform illumination .",
    "flattening the images in this way creates a variation in sensitivity for point sources from the center to the top and bottom edges that is usually corrected in the pipeline data reduction process using _",
    "astrodrizzle_. since we are interested in accurately measuring the surface brightnesses of the galaxies and avoiding correlated noise between pixels , we chose not to correct for pixel size variation in our sbf data reduction process .",
    "the practical effect of this decision is that the psf at the extreme upper and lower regions of the image does not match the psf near the center .",
    "we have carefully chosen psf reference stars from the same vertical region of the field of view as the galaxies being analyzed ( usually very near the center ) to avoid any systematic offset between the psf photometric normalization or power spectrum shape and the galaxy fluctuations .",
    "the chosen psf stars were all unresolved , isolated from other bright objects , and much brighter than the globular cluster population .",

    "are composed of composite stellar populations with potentially many bursts of star formation . because the fluctuations are dominated by the most luminous stars weighted as @xmath255 , they are even more strongly weighted towards young , luminous populations than are broad - band galaxy colors ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "a composite population model will therefore predict an sbf magnitude close to that of the younger ( or brighter ) model component , even when the young population is only a small fraction ( @xmath6% to 20% ) of the galaxy by mass ( jensen et al .  2003 ; blakeslee et al .  2001 ; liu et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the comparison to ssp model ages shown in this section should be considered the time since the most recent episode of star formation , not the average age of the dominant stellar population by mass .",

    "both model variations suggest that the intermediate - color galaxies in our sample have younger populations , as expected due to the presence of intermediate - age agb stars .",
    "the models imply that the bluest galaxies are old and metal - poor . while we have chosen to show the comparison for @xmath73  and @xmath2 , the conclusions are the same when we compare the models to @xmath74   instead of @xmath73  or @xmath3  instead of @xmath2 .",
    "the second set of models was developed by the teramo spot group ( version basel3.1 , raimondo 2009 ; raimondo et al .",
    "the teramo spot models pay special attention to the thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , particularly in young to intermediate - age populations .",
    "the spot model sbf magnitude predictions in the near - ir have been empirically compared to a variety of clusters in the large magellanic cloud and have been shown to match empirical measurements of sbf magnitudes , integrated magnitudes , star counts , and colors ( raimondo 2009 ; cantiello et al .  2007 ; cantiello 2012 ) .",
    "the spot models in figure  [ spot110 ]  differ significantly from the basti models in figure  [ teramo110 ] , although they are based on the same stellar evolutionary tracks as the basti models in the upper panel of fig .",

    "the spot models derive sbf magnitudes in a procedure that allows modelers to statistically combine various stellar population models produced by stochastic variations in the number and properties of bright and rare stars , including the tp - agb and horizontal branch populations in intermediate - age and old stellar populations .",
    "overall , the spot and basti models agree for the red and intermediate - color ellipticals , with somewhat fainter sbf magnitudes for the oldest and most metal - rich giant ellipticals .",
    "the spot models predict a larger spread in sbf magnitude at younger ages and imply that the bluer galaxies in the sample are all younger than about 5  gyr , in contrast with the basti models , which span a narrower range in @xmath73  and imply ages greater than 5  gyr for the bluest galaxies .",
    "the third set of models are based on the padova isochrones ( fig .",

    "the bluest galaxies in the sample are consistent with ages intermediate between the basti and spot models , in the range 3 to 7 gyr . because of their larger spread in sbf magnitude predictions , the padova models , as compared to the other sets of models , suggest that the data provide better discrimination between ages and metallicities .",
    "sbf measurements at two wavelengths can be used to eliminate uncertainties resulting from distance error ; for instance , the `` fluctuation color '' @xmath259  can be compared to stellar population models in a distance - independent way .",
    "figure  [ teramo110 - 160models ] compares @xmath259  to the teramo basti solar - scaled and @xmath257-enhanced models as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed by lee et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the predicted sbf magnitudes are sensitive to @xmath257-element abundance mostly because of the effects of oxygen - enhancement on the upper red giant branch and agb phase . the data in figure  [ teramo110 - 160models ] agree on average with the @xmath257-enhanced models relatively well , but only poorly with the solar - scaled models .",
    "however , this set of @xmath257-enhanced models also predicts a narrower range of @xmath259  than is observed .",
    "in particular , the low - mass dwarf ic3032 in virgo agrees better with the locus of the solar - scaled models ; this may indicate real variation in @xmath257-element abundance ratios among the sample galaxies .",
    "we conclude that fluctuation colors can provide useful information on elemental abundance ratio trends with age and metallicity in elliptical galaxies , independent of the uncertainties in the distance calibration .",
    "in addition , comparisons with other observables that are sensitive to age , metallicity , or @xmath257-enhancement should provide powerful joint constraints for future stellar population models .      to further explore the origins of the scatter in sbf magnitude among the low - luminosity blue dwarf ellipticals , we measured the radial behavior of the sbf amplitude .",
    "many of the galaxies in our sample , particularly the low - luminosity galaxies , are quite elliptical . to get the cleanest gradient measurements possible , we repeated the sbf analysis and measured @xmath2  colors in elliptical annuli for a subset of the galaxies with significant @xmath76  gradients ( ic  1919 , ngc  1375 , ngc  1380 , ic  3025 , ic  3487 , and ic  3586",

    "the comparison of radial sbf gradients to the models shows a significant difference between the giant ellipticals and the smaller galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies show a gradient sloping from upper left to lower right in figure  [ teramo110-radial ] , roughly along lines of constant metallicity .",
    "while the various models look quite different in detail , they all have lines of constant metallicity sloping in approximately the same direction at the relevant colors .",
    "the lower - luminosity galaxies have centers ( larger symbols in fig .  [ teramo110-radial ] )",
    "consistent with younger stellar populations ( brighter fluctuations ) and nearly constant metallicities : ic  1919 , ic  3025 , ic  3487 , ic  3586 , and ngc  1375 all have brighter fluctuations near their centers .",
    "in contrast , the giant ellipticals on the red end of the diagram tend to show older , and sometimes more metal - rich , populations in their centers : ic  3032 , ic  2006 , ngc  1374 , ngc  1399 , ngc  1404 , ngc  4458 , and ngc  4649 have fainter fluctuations towards their centers .",
    "four of the sixteen galaxies ( ngc  1380 , ngc  1344 , ngc  4458 , and ngc  4472 ) appear to have color and sbf gradients consistent with little or no age variation .",
    "the majority of the galaxies show gradients consistent with primarily age variations , however .",
    "the ir sbf and color gradients hint at differing formation histories for the galaxies .",
    "as noted above , low - luminosity blue elliptical galaxies usually have older populations at large radii , and thus to have formed stars more recently near their centers from metal - poor gas , while the giant ellipticals formed stars in their cores long ago from enriched gas . optical studies of sbf gradients , in contrast , suggest that the outer parts of giant ellipticals have colors and fluctuation magnitudes consistent with lower metallicity populations and little or no age gradient ( cantiello et al .  2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "our ir measurements do not cover as large a range in radius as the optical studies because of the smaller field of view spanned by the ir detectors and the brighter sky background . because the data here are confined within the effective radius of the several largest galaxies ( table  [ tab : props ] )",
    ", we can not derive strong constraints on the large - scale stellar population gradients in these giant galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the physical size ( @xmath2605  kpc ) of the radial region probed by our sbf data is similar to that of the luminous dense cores observed at high redshift ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2010 ; van der wel et al .",
    "2014 ) , which are believed to be the seeds around which massive modern - day ellipticals were assembled through hierarchical merging and accretion .",
    "our results on the old ages and relative homogeneity of the stellar populations of the giant ellipticals within the central region are thus in line with this scenario for early - type galaxy evolution , if the elliptical galaxies in our sample may be compared with the high - redshift counterparts ( fritz et al .",
    "2014 ) . at much larger radii in giant ellipticals ,",
    "evidence exists from optical and ir color gradients that the stellar populations at several effective radii are older than the mean stellar age in the core ( la barbera et al .",
    "2012 ; but see also greene et al .",
    "2015 ) . while our data do not probe such large radii in the massive galaxies , we find the same trend for the lower mass galaxies where our measurements do reach beyond the effective radius",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the ir sbf gradients to correspondingly large radii in the massive ellipticals to see if these also show evidence for larger ages in the galaxy outskirts .",
    "crucially for the purpose of distance measurement , the radial and population variations in the reddest galaxies cause sbf magnitude variations _ along _ the direction of the linear calibration .",
    "these galaxies are ideally suited for distance measurement because variations from galaxy to galaxy in age or metallicity are adequately accommodated by the calibration slope with @xmath2 . on the other hand , the radial gradients in sbf magnitude in the bluer dwarf galaxies ( the gray symbols in the left half of fig .",
    "[ teramo110-radial ] are perpendicular to the quadratic calibration relation , leading to _ greater _ scatter in the distance calibration .",
    "these low - luminosity dwarfs show a wide range of ages and metallicities , with several showing evidence of recent star formation near their centers , as revealed by their sbf magnitudes .",
    "only one set of sbf measurements and models is shown in figure  [ teramo110-radial ] ; the general conclusions , however , are consistent for all the models discussed herein .",
    "the radial variations are consistently sloped along lines of constant metallicity for all the models , so even though the models might not agree on the specific age and metallicity of a particular galaxy , the trend towards younger ages in the centers of bluer dwarf galaxies is consistent for all the models .",

    "( 2000 ) , and caldwell et al .",
    "the former index is more sensitive to age , and the latter to metallicity .",
    "figure  [ lickindexfigure ] compares these data with the @xmath2630.3  dex @xmath257-enhanced model predictions from lee & worthey ( 2005 ) .",
    "the line index measurements generally sample different regions of the galaxies than our sbf data , but we see again that the reddest ellipticals agree with the old , metal - rich population models .",
    "the youngest galaxies as determined using absorption lines do not always agree with the sbf models .",
    "ic  3487 has the strongest h@xmath264 index but the faintest @xmath73  among the bluer galaxies , implying a relatively older age compared to ngc  1375 , which has somewhat weaker h@xmath264 and brighter @xmath73(although there is considerable variation between sbf models at the youngest ages ) .",
    "further work is needed to explore the radial behavior of mg@xmath262 and h@xmath264 as compared to our sbf measurements on the same scales , particularly since we detect a significant radial age gradient in many of the lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "the sbf models shown in figures  [ teramo110 ] , [ spot110 ] , and [ padova110 ] agree for old , metal - rich populations such as those commonly found in giant elliptical galaxies , and for which extensive comparisons have been made in the past ( e.g. , jensen et al .",

    "the net effect is that exposure times to achieve a particular sbf @xmath72 ratio is about the same in the two filters , but the ability to detect and remove contaminating point sources ( primarily globular clusters ) is better at @xmath0 , and there is less scatter in the calibration .",
    "we therefore advise choosing @xmath0  over @xmath1  when possible",

    "typical one - orbit exposure times ( @xmath266s ) suffice for measuring distances in either @xmath0  or @xmath1  out to about 80  mpc .",
    "this distance limit is imposed by the point source sensitivity required to detect and remove globular clusters from the image , with the goal of reaching within @xmath2581  mag of the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function in @xmath0 , or @xmath2581.5  mag of the peak in @xmath1 , for which the fluctuations are relatively brighter ( jensen et al .",
    "the sbf signal itself can be detected to much larger distances ( beyond 100  mpc ) in a single orbit , but the large correction for contaminating point sources would then dominate the uncertainty .",
    "exposure times for more distant galaxies should be scaled to achieve a point source sensitivity sufficient to detect and remove globular clusters 1  to 1.5  mag brighter than the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function .",
    "the exposure time needed to detect the stochastic fluctuations that comprise the sbf signal goes as @xmath267 , but the time required to detect the globular clusters increases significantly faster , scaling as @xmath268 to @xmath269 , because of the bright background on which the globular clusters are superimposed .",

    "we find that the luminous red galaxies in the sample follow linear relations between absolute sbf magnitude and optical or ir color ; sbf distances to such galaxies can be determined within a statistical uncertainty of 5% using the calibration relations that we have presented in equations  ( [ eq : j_gz ] ) through  ( [ eq : h_jh ] ) . the systematic uncertainty of this calibration is @xmath6% due to the uncertainty in the cepheid calibration on which this work is based .",
    "stellar population models are not consistent enough to provide a direct calibration of the ir sbf technique accurate to 10% , but they are valuable for inferring age and metallicity trends in and among the sample galaxies . the scatter in sbf magnitude among bluer galaxies is large , indicating that a wider variety of stellar populations dominate the light from these galaxies and that a simple broadband color does not adequately parameterize the complexities inherent in such populations",

    "<S> we present new calibrations of the near - infrared surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) distance method for the f110w ( @xmath0 ) and f160w ( @xmath1 ) bandpasses of the wide field camera  3 infrared channel ( wfc3/ir ) on the _ hubble space telescope_. the calibrations are based on data for 16 early - type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters observed with wfc3/ir and are provided as functions of both the optical @xmath2  and near - infrared @xmath3  colors . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter about the linear calibration relations for the luminous red galaxies in the sample is approximately 0.10 mag , corresponding to a statistical error of 5% in distance . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that the distance to any suitably bright elliptical galaxy can be measured with this precision out to about 80  mpc in a single - orbit observation with wfc3/ir , making this a remarkably powerful instrument for extragalactic distances . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration sample also includes much bluer and lower - luminosity galaxies than previously used for ir sbf studies , revealing interesting population differences that cause the calibration scatter to increase for dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with single - burst population models show that , as expected , the redder early - type galaxies contain old , metal - rich populations , while the bluer dwarf ellipticals contain a wider range of ages and lower metallicities than their more massive counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> radial sbf gradients reveal that ir color gradients are largely an age effect ; the bluer dwarfs typically have their youngest populations near their centers , while the redder giant ellipticals show only weak trends and in the opposite sense . because of the population variations among bluer galaxies , distance measurements in the near - ir are best limited to red early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with some practical guidelines for using wfc3/ir to measure reliable sbf distances . </S>"
