    "the previous paragraph tells us that @xmath652 a.s .",
    "it is therefore enough to consider @xmath653 .",
    "equivalently , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath654 , so we focus on player 1 .",
    "player 1 will win every game he plays if @xmath655 , hence if the walk starts in @xmath619 and its second component @xmath12 satisfies @xmath656 , or if it starts in @xmath622 and @xmath631 ; player 1 will lose every game he plays if @xmath657 , hence if the walk starts in @xmath622 and @xmath656 or if it starts in @xmath619 and @xmath631 .",
    "the result is that , on excursions of the random walk away from @xmath514 , either player 1 will win every game he plays or player 1 will lose every game he plays . define @xmath658 in terms of the discrete - time simple symmetric random walk as follows .",
    "@xmath659 is the first time the walk visits @xmath660 ; @xmath661 is the next time the walk visits @xmath662 ; @xmath663 is the next time the walk visits @xmath660 ; @xmath664 is the next time the walk visits @xmath662 ; and so on .",
    "then @xmath665 are independent for @xmath666 and identically distributed for @xmath667 , assuming values in the set of even positive integers ; their well - known ( feller 1968 , p.  89 ) distribution @xmath668 satisfies @xmath669 as @xmath50 through the even integers for some @xmath550 , so lemma  [ asymptotic ] applies . to get player 1 s profit , we must convert these discrete - time excursions to continuous time and then run a poisson process with rate 1 over those intervals , alternating between always winning and always losing . with @xmath313 denoting the cumulative profit to player 1 up to time @xmath310 , we claim that @xmath670 a.s .",
    ", so that , with probability 1 , the limit does not exist and hence @xmath216 does not exist . to prove this",
    "we need only consider a subsequence of times that achieves these limits .",
    "using the result of kesten described above , we can assume without loss of generality that on @xmath671 , @xmath672 , and so on , player 1 always wins , while on @xmath673 , @xmath674 , and so on , player 1 always loses .",
    "( this assumes the walk starts in @xmath619 ; if it starts in @xmath622 , the opposite occurs . ) we also assume , again without loss of generality , that @xmath675 , that is , we ignore the time before the initial excursion .",
    "let @xmath569 be the profits of player 1 accumulated during the winning excursions , and let @xmath584 be the losses of player 1 accumulated during the losing excursions .",

    "this proves the assertions about @xmath216 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath11 when @xmath28 .",
    "now @xmath682 , which by corollary  [ couple - spin ] is 0 at @xmath254 .",
    "if we could show that this function is increasing in @xmath16 , the proof would be complete .",
    "however , this monotonicity property appears difficult to prove . as in the proof of theorem  [ p0=1,p3=0-thm ]",
    ", we take an alternative approach .",
    "let @xmath352 be the @xmath350 two - dimensional marginal of the stationary distribution @xmath348 when the probability parameters are @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 .",

    "we claim that @xmath686 .",
    "suppose not .",
    "then , by corollary  [ symm - spin ] , @xmath687 , so by lemma  [ invariance - spin ] , @xmath348 is concentrated on the four states that have the same spin at every odd site and the same spin at every even site .",

    "we apply @xmath695 with @xmath696 , @xmath697 , and @xmath698 , to get four linear equations in @xmath699 , @xmath700 , @xmath701 , and @xmath702 , namely @xmath703 , @xmath704 , @xmath705 , and @xmath693 , for which there is no solution with @xmath706 . since @xmath262",

    "( in fact , conditions ( c ) and ( d ) of theorem  [ ergodicity ] also apply . ) hence by theorem  [ lim mu^n ] we know that @xmath449 and @xmath455 exist .",
    "we have computed these means exactly for @xmath22 ( ethier and lee 2012 ) and have found that the former has stabilized to 4 significant digits by @xmath708 , while the latter has stabilized to 11 significant digits by @xmath708 .",

    "can we say anything about the limits , based on these computations ?",

    "the monotonicity problem mentioned in the proof of theorem  [ p0=1,p3=0-thm ] is interesting .",
    "more generally , assuming that the markov chain is ergodic , let @xmath208 be the mean parameter of theorem  [ slln - thm ] . is this function monotonically increasing in each variable ? a partial result in this direction is that it is nondecreasing in each variable if we restrict to parameter vectors satisfying the attractiveness condition , @xmath713 .",
    "( this follows from theorem  iii.1.5 of liggett 1985 . )",
