    "lanthanum trifluoride doped with the rare - earth ( r ) ions is commonly used for the optical applications and as a material for electrodes in detectors . during the past decades the optical spectra of all r impurities except pm in laf@xmath0 were measured and the results analyzed using the semiempirical crystal field models @xcite . with the exceptions of the work of ishii _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and brik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on the discrete variational multi - electron method ( dv - me ) , the _ ab - initio _ theory was missing , however . dv - me method and its results are discussed and compared to the present ones in part 5 .",
    "the survey of the attempts to calculate the crystal - field parameters ( cfp ) in the rare - earth compounds may be found in @xcite .",
    "a new theoretical approach has been recently used to calculate the crystal field parameters of rare - earth in aluminates , gallates , cobaltites and manganites with the orthorhombic perovskite structure @xcite .",
    "the method uses the density functional theory band structure calculation , followed by a transformation of the kohn - sham hamiltonian to the wannier basis and an expansion of its local part in the spherical tensor operators .",
    "the cfp serve as an input to an atomic exact diagonalization program , which takes into account also the @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction , spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman interaction .",
    "the calculated results agree remarkably well with the experiment : the crystal - field - split multiplet levels within a few mev and magnetic properties are correctly described as well .",
    "for any site symmetry the method yields an unambiguous set of cfp . this is important especially if the local symmetry of the r site is low and many cfp are needed to fully characterize the crystal field .",
    "semiempirical methods , as well as the analysis of optical data make usually use of the least squares fitting , a procedure often yielding ambiguous results . with the exception of a single parameter , to be discussed below , the present method is fully _ ab - initio _ i.e. the only necessary inputs are the atomic composition and the crystal structure of the compound in question .    in the orthorhombic perovskites , to which the method was already successfully applied @xcite , the symmetry of the r site is @xmath2 and 15 parameters , 3 real and 6 complex cfp , are necessary .",
    "the situation of r impurities in laf@xmath0 , which is considered here , is similar .",
    "the site symmetry of la@xmath3 site in laf@xmath0 is @xmath4 and again 15 parameters , 3 real and 6 complex cfp , are necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the method and the computational details are described in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the calculated energy levels and cfp are presented in section 4 . in the same section the theoretical crystal field spectra",
    "are compared with the experimental data collected by carnall _",
    "section 5 contains discussion , followed by the conclusions in section 6 .",
    "an effective hamiltonian operating on the @xmath1 electrons can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spherically symmetric free ion hamiltonian , @xmath7 corresponds to the zeeman interaction and @xmath8 is the crystal - field term . in the wybourne notation @xcite @xmath8 has the form @xmath9_{ij } f_{i}^{\\dagger } f_{j } \\label{eq : hcf}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a spherical tensor operator of rank @xmath11 acting on the @xmath1 electrons of the r ion , for which @xmath12 is equal to six .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 are the cfp .",
    "hermiticity of @xmath8 requires that @xmath14 .",
    "the operators @xmath15 create and annihilate an electron in an @xmath16-orbital @xmath17 .",
    "the details of @xmath6 are given e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "calculation of the cfp proceeds in four steps :    1 .",
    "standard selfconsistent band calculation with @xmath1 states included in the core .",
    "the result of this step is the kohn - sham potential , which is subsequently used in the next step .",
    "the calculation is non spin - polarized .",
    "a hamiltonian describing r @xmath1 states together with fluorine @xmath18 and @xmath19 states subject to the kohn - sham potential from the previous step is diagonalized . to eliminate other valence states an orbital operator which adds a large positive constant to the potential acting on these states",
    "relative position of @xmath1 and fluorine states is adjusted by applying similar operator to the fluorine states , which shifts their potential by the hybridization parameter @xmath20 ( the only parameter of method ) .",
    "the @xmath1 band states are transformed to wannier basis using the wien2wannier @xcite and wannier90 @xcite packages .",
    "the result of this step , relevant for cfp calculation is the hamiltonian @xmath21 in the basis of @xmath1 wannier functions .",
    "local @xmath1 hamiltonian @xmath22 is obtained as the on - site part @xmath21 .",
    "finally @xmath22 is expanded in series of spherical tensor operators .",
    "the coefficients of expansion are the cfp @xmath23 .    to find @xmath23 we made use of the fact that @xmath24 form complete orthogonal set of operators in the subspace of @xmath1 states",

    ". detailed description of the analysis may be found in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 appears due to the hybridization between the rare - earth @xmath1 states and the valence states of its ligands . in the @xmath29 metal compounds the hybridization is in most cases a dominating source of the crystal field . for the co : zno system kuzian _",
    "@xcite successfully reproduced the @xmath30-factors and the zero - field splitting , by treating the hopping between the cobalt @xmath29 orbitals and the @xmath18 states of the fluorine ligands as a perturbation .",
    "our treatment of the hybridization is analogical to that of kuzian _ et al . _ and is briefly described in ref .",
    "@xmath28 can be estimated using a charge transfer energy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total energy of the ground state of the system ( @xmath33 electrons in @xmath1 shell of r ion and @xmath34 electrons in the valence band ) , while @xmath35 corresponds to the excited state in which one of the valence electrons was transferred in the @xmath1 electron shell .",
    "the hybridization parameter thus can be calculated by performing two calculations with @xmath1 electrons treated as the core states - the first one with @xmath36 , the second with @xmath37 electron configurations .",
    "the results of such a calculation for r : laf@xmath0 system are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the laf@xmath0 crystallizes in trigonal symmetry ( @xmath38 space group ) with six la in the hexagonal unit cell @xcite . to determine the band structure ( steps 1 and 2 in the previous section ) the wien2k package @xcite",
    "was used with the exchange - correlation of the generalized - gradient approximation form @xcite . for the pure laf@xmath0 compound",
    "the experimental crystal structure was taken from @xcite . in r : laf@xmath0 one of the six la atoms was replaced by a rare - earth atom and the internal structure was optimized by minimizing the atomic forces .",
    "the resulting structure has only the identity and @xmath4 symmetry operations . the unit cell containing 24 atoms is displayed in fig . [ fig : structure ] .",
    "the eigenvalue problem was solved in 47 points of the irreducible part of the brillouin zone and the number of basis functions was @xmath39 1780 ( corresponding to parameter @xmath40=7 ) .",
    "the calculations were non - spin - polarized . the atomic radii of r and f were 2.4 and 2 a.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "la@xmath41f@xmath0 used in the calculation of cfp .",
    "the @xmath4 symmetry axis is along the axis a.,width=453 ]    the multiplet splitting and magnetism of rare - earth ions depend only weakly on the free ion parameters , though there may be exceptions when the energy difference of the free ion multiplet is small .",
    "@xcite analyzed systematically the available absorption and luminescence data of trivalent lanthanide ions doped into laf@xmath0 . using the least squares analysis the free ion parameters were obtained , which we used in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as here .",
    "in addition 9 real cfp were obtained , corresponding to the @xmath42 symmetry by which the actual @xmath4 symmetry was approximated .",

    "the experimental data reported by different authors are summarized in @xcite .",
    "understandably not all energy levels were detected ( for pm the experimental data are missing altogether ) .",
    "this makes the comparison of theory and experiment complicated as in many cases the missing levels are not unambiguously identified .",
    "moreover , the crystal field could lead to overlap of different @xmath43 multiplets .",
    "faced with this situation we characterize the agreement of theory and experiment by the mean square deviation @xmath44^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 equals to the number of multiplets with the provision that overlapping multiplets are treated as a single group .",

    "we first discuss the dv_me method @xcite and its application to pr : laf@xmath0 and eu : laf@xmath0 as described in @xcite .",
    "the method calculates the multiplet splitting in two steps . in the first step the density functional theory based calculation",
    "is performed for a cluster consisting of the r@xmath3 ion and its ligands .",
    "the rest of the crystal is taken into account by adding an effective madelung potential to the hamiltonian . in the second step",
    "the many - electron problem is solved by selecting as a basis the cluster one - electron eigenstates with the dominant @xmath1 character .",
    "choice of the ligands to be included in the cluster and the cluster embedding are difficult problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite and fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "another problem is connected with the one - electron part of the many - electron hamiltonian .",
    "the on - site interaction of the @xmath1 electrons with the potential they create themselves is not accounted for .",
    "this spurious self - interaction is inherent to most of the dft based methods and it may seriously deform the calculated crystal field .",
    "also the one - electron part , taken from the discrete variational calculation already contains the electron correlation , which is for the second time included in the many - electron hamiltonian .",
    "this are likely to be the reasons why the dv - me calculated crystal field for eu : laf@xmath0 is in poor agreement with the experiment ( cf .",
    "table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement is significantly improved only when two semiempirical parameters are introduced . in the present method the self - interaction is avoided by calculating the potential with the @xmath1 states in the core , where they contribute to the spherical part of the potential only ( cf . 1st step in section [ sec : methods ] ) and there is no double counting of the correlation .",
    "the present results show convincingly that the method of cfp calculation , described in section [ sec : methods ] , can be successfully used also if the r site has a low symmetry .",
    "the mean square deviation @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] , calculated for optimal value of the hybridization parameter is , with exception of yb , smaller than 30 @xmath54 .",
    "we point out that no attempt was done to regroup the experimental results , which would make @xmath51 even smaller .",
    "the hybridization of the @xmath1 states with the valence states of the fluorine plays an important role - as documented in figs .",
    "[ fig : babs_nd ] and [ fig : babs_er ] increase of the hybridization ( i.e. reduction of the parameter @xmath28 ) changes some of the cfp by as much as 100 % .",
    "we note that large value of @xmath28 corresponds to the vanishing hybridization .",
    "the dependence of cfp on @xmath28 is smooth , allowing thus an interpolation if there is a need .    with increasing number of the @xmath1 electrons the strength of crystal field the cfp of 4th and 6th order decrease , while 2nd order cfp remain almost unchanged ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : bk0 ] , [ fig : sk ] ) , a similar behavior we found for r@xmath3 impurities in the yalo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sk ] ) and the @xmath56 compare well with those deduced from the data of carnall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( figs . [",
    "fig : bk0 ] , [ fig : sk ] ) . the remaining difference may be connected with too high ( 16.7 % ) content of r atoms in the unit cell . to decrease",
    "this content would require a supercell with several hundreds atoms , which is beyond our present computational possibilities .",
    "other possible sources of the difference are the replacement of the actual @xmath4 local symmetry by @xmath42 in the carnall _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite analysis , uncertainty in experimental data ( especially in cases of undetected levels ) and keeping @xmath28 fixed at 0.4 ry .",
    "previously we treated @xmath28 as an adjustable parameter @xcite . in the present work we have also attempted to calculate @xmath28 in a straightforward way described in section [ sec : delta ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath28 and @xmath28 obtained from the fitting of experiment are in a fair agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] ) , indicating thus that the model can be made fully _ ab - initio_.",
    "the method to calculate crystal field parameters was successfully applied to rare earth impurities in laf@xmath0 , showing its applicability to r on sites with an arbitrary local symmetry . despite the ionic character of the compound the r(@xmath1 ) - f(@xmath57 ) hybridization plays a significant role .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 , which is needed to describe this hybridization , can be calculated independently and the calculated value is in a fair agreement with value which fit the experiment .",
    "the method thus has potential to be fully _ ab - initio _",
    "i.e. only the atomic composition and the crystal structure are needed to determine the crystal field .",
    "this would be particularly useful in systems in which the optical absorption data are scarce or missing and in systems with defects and/or several different r ions .",
    "the method has only moderate demands on the computing facility and it is now freely accessible to public @xcite",
