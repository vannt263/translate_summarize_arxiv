    "the fact that electrons are described by quantum mechanics , not classical mechanics , can be confirmed from a number of features in the electrical transport properties of metals at low temperatures.@xcite well - known examples of such ` signatures of quantum transport ' are the fano factor for the shot noise power , the weak localization correction to the conductance , and the conductance fluctuations of a mesoscopic conductor .",
    "disorder plays an important role in the understanding of these effects in normal metals , because electrical transport in metals at low temperatures is dominated by scattering off impurities comparable in size to the fermi wavelength of the conduction electrons .",
    "theoretically , the presence of disorder allows for the use of powerful field - theoretic techniques , which give accurate predictions for an ` ensemble average ' over different impurity configurations.@xcite    an important feature of the signatures of quantum transport in disordered conductors is that their size is independent of material properties , sample size , or the concentration or type of impurities.@xcite the conditions under which this ` universality ' appears are rather mild : at zero temperature and for dc transport one needs@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi wavelength , @xmath3 the fermi velocity , @xmath4 the elastic scattering time , and @xmath5 the typical dwell time of electrons travelling between source and drain contacts .",
    "in addition one requires that the sample s dimensionless conductance @xmath6 , so that anderson localization can be ruled out .",
    "the quantum effects do , however , show a weak dependence on the nature of the electron dynamics near @xmath5 , which is why the ` universal ' signatures of quantum transport have slightly different magnitudes in , _",
    "e.g. _ , disordered quantum dots and quantum wires , reflecting the difference between ergodic and diffusive dynamics in these two systems .    with the fabrication of high - mobility two - dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructes , it has become possible to study quantum transport in devices in which the electron motion is ballistic over significantly longer distances than in metal samples , without scattering off point - like impurities . in such devices ,",
    "nontrivial geometries are achieved by the placement of artificial scattering centers or sample boundaries .",
    "two paradigmatic examples , a ballistic quantum dot and an antidot lattice , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a quantum dot is a region of a two - dimensional electron gas confined by metal gates and coupled to source and drain electrodes via narrow contacts;@xcite an antidot lattice is an electron gas with artificial macroscopic scattering centers.@xcite in the theoretical literature , a collection of randomly placed circular antidots is referred to as a ` lorentz gas ' .    because the signatures of quantum transport in disordered metals do not depend on impurity concentration or type one",
    "may be tempted to expect that ballistic conductors are characterized by the same universal signatures of quantum transport as their disordered counterparts .",
    "the equivalent expectation in the context of spectral statistics is known as the `` bohigas  giannoni  schmit conjecture''@xcite and believed to be true . in a seminal article ,",
    "aleiner and larkin pointed out that this expectation need not always be correct for transport , however.@xcite they argued that there is a minimal time required for the appearance of quantum effects in ballistic conductors.@xcite this time is the ` ehrenfest time ' @xmath0 , the time it takes for a minimal wavepacket to diverge and reach a size such that it can no longer be described by a single classical trajectory.@xcite the ehrenfest time poses a short - time threshold for the appearance of quantum effects , because quantum phenomena can not occur as long as a wavepacket travels along a single classical trajectory .",
    "one expects the same signatures of quantum transport in disordered and ballistic conductors only if @xmath7.@xcite    for a ballistic conductor in which the classical electron dynamics is chaotic with lyapunov exponent @xmath8 , one has @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a classical separation beyond which trajectories should be considered uncorrelated . in most experiments , @xmath11 and the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taue ] ) not numerically large , so that @xmath0 is not much larger than the elastic scattering time @xmath4 .",
    "this explains why , indeed , the signatures of quantum transport in many ballistic conductors are so similar to those of normal metals with point - like impurities.@xcite nevertheless , there is no a priori reason why the logarithm in eq .  ( [ eq : taue ] ) must be small , and one may ask about the fate of quantum transport if @xmath12 ( or @xmath0 comparable to inverse frequency or the appropriate inelastic time , if time - dependent transport or finite temperatures are considered ) . this question has received increasing attention in the last decade.@xcite it is a question of fundamental importance from a theoretical point of view , because the regime of large @xmath0 is the only parameter regime in which the signatures of quantum transport may discriminate between disordered and ballistic conductors . moreover , large ehrenfest times appear naturally in the semiclassical limit @xmath13 , which provides one of the conditions necessary for the universality of the signatures of quantum transport , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : univcond ] ) above .",
    "the ehrenfest - time dependence of weak localization was first addressed in the original article by aleiner and larkin.@xcite the theory of ref .",
    "is based on a field - theoretic approach which employs a minimal amount of diffraction from disorder in order to mimic the diffractive effects of scattering off the curved boundaries of the sample and the artificial scattering centers.@xcite for the lorentz gas , aleiner and larkin showed that the weak localization correction @xmath14 to the ac conductivity acquires ehrenfest - time dependent oscillations , @xmath15 .",
    "they also considered the weak localization correction @xmath16 to the dc conductance of a ballistic quantum dot , which is proportional to @xmath17,@xcite @xmath18 being the dot s dephasing time .",
    "agam , aleiner , and larkin calculated the fano factor @xmath19 of a ballistic quantum dot,@xcite which has the same exponential dependence @xmath20 as @xmath16 .",
    "the experimental observation of the suppression of weak localization in an antidot lattice at large @xmath21 and the suppression of the shot noise power in a ballistic quantum dot at large @xmath22 were consistent with the theoretical predictions.@xcite    there is a second theoretical approach to quantum transport in ballistic conductors .",
    "this approach starts from a semiclassical expression of the sample s scattering matrix in terms of classical trajectories connecting the contacts .",
    "since the conductance is proportional to the square of a scattering amplitude , the conductance is then expressed as a double sum over classical trajectories.@xcite originally , the trajectory sums were performed in the so - called diagonal approximation , in which only the diagonal terms in the double sum were kept.@xcite although the diagonal approximation could explain the existence of weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations in ballistic quantum dots , as well as the dependences on the fermi energy and an applied magnetic field,@xcite it could not describe the ehrenfest - time dependences .",
    "a technical breakthrough occurred when sieber and richter were able to include the leading off - diagonal terms into the summation.@xcite with off - diagonal contributions , the trajectory - based approach could successfully capture @xmath0 dependences , not only of the weak localization correction and fano factor of a quantum dot,@xcite but also of quantum signatures whose @xmath0 dependence was not known from the field - theoretic approach , such as the conductance fluctuations or the current pumped through a quantum dot with time - dependent shape ( a `` quantum pump'').@xcite unlike weak localization and the fano factor , the variance of the conductance @xmath23 and the mean square pumped current were found not to disappear in the limit of large ehrenfest times .",
    "in fact , in the absence of dephasing , @xmath23 is independent of @xmath0 in a quantum dot , as was first observed by tworzydlo _",
    "_  and jacquod and sukhorukov on the basis of numerical simulations.@xcite in the semiclassical theory the remarkable @xmath0-insensivity of @xmath23 in quantum dots has its origin in a large contribution to @xmath23 from trajectories that spend a long time in the vicinity of periodic orbits.@xcite since such trajectories can have arbitrarily long dwell times , the existence of @xmath0 as a short - time threshold for quantum effects no longer poses a limitation on the size of mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "= 0.99    with the exception of the original article by aleiner and larkin,@xcite who considered weak localization in a lorentz gas , all theoretical work on @xmath0 dependences has focused on ballistic quantum dots .",
    "the goal of the present article is to investigate the @xmath0 dependence of quantum transport in arbitrary ballistic conductors .",
    "we use the trajectory - based approach and restrict ourselves to dc transport at temperatures low enough that dephasing does not play a significant role , so that the dwell time @xmath5 serves as the relevant long - time cut - off for quantum effects .",
    "( the @xmath0-dependence of weak localization and conductance fluctuations in the presence of dephasing is considered in refs .  .",
    ") our extension of the trajectory - based approach to arbitrary ballistic conductors follows earlier work by smilansky and coworkers,@xcite who carried out a similar program for the diagonal approximation to spectral fluctuations in closed quantum systems .",
    "our final results are general expressions relating the fano factor , weak localization , and conductance fluctuations to coarse - grained propagators of the classical dynamics in the ballistic conductor .",
    "we show that these general expressions reproduce known results for ballistic quantum dots and use our results to find the @xmath0-dependence of the signatures of quantum transport in a quasi - one dimensional lorentz gas .",
    "our results for the fano factor and the weak localization correction to the conductance agree with general expressions obtained in the field - theoretical formalism ; the conductance fluctuations have not been calculated using the field - theoretical formalism , so that a comparison is not possible .",
    "before we proceed with the exposition of the theory and a discussion of the results , two remarks about the specific form of the semiclassical limit and the appropriate classical propagators need to be made .",
    "first , we note that universality of quantum effects can be expected only in the limit @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the elastic mean free path , _ cf . _",
    "( [ eq : univcond ] ) above .",
    "since @xmath2 is proportional to planck s constant @xmath26 , this limit is equivalent to the semiclassical limit @xmath27 .",
    "the ehrenfest time , however , depends logarithmically on @xmath26 through the ratio @xmath28 , _ cf . _ eq .",
    "( [ eq : taue ] ) above .",
    "since a nontrivial ehrenfest - time dependence of quantum transport requires that @xmath12 , one thus needs a semiclassical limit in which @xmath5 grows logarithmically while sending @xmath27 .",
    "an @xmath26-dependent increase of @xmath5 requires an @xmath26-dependent change of the classical dynamics .",
    "for the two examples considered here , a quantum dot and the lorentz gas , this corresponds to an @xmath26-dependent reduction of the size of openings or an increase of the system size @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "since the final results will be independent of the details of the classical dynamics and since the required @xmath26-dependences are rather weak ( only logarithmic in @xmath26 ) , we believe that this slight modification of the classical dynamics while taking the semiclassical limit @xmath27 is inconsequential .    the classical propagators appearing in our results will be coarse - grained both with respect to time and with respect to the phase space coordinates .",
    "the coarse - graining with respect to time is for a time window of order @xmath30 ; the coarse - graining with respect to the phase space coordinates corresponds to a distance @xmath10 , which is the distance below which the classical dynamics can be linearized . the same distance @xmath10 also appears in the definition ( [ eq : taue ] ) of the ehrenfest time . since both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are much smaller than @xmath5 , such coarse - grained classical propagators are sufficient for a description of quantum transport .",
    "the advantage of coarse - grained classical propagators is that no subtle phase space correlations need to be accounted for when evaluating the final expressions . in this respect ,",
    "our final expressions differ from those in refs .   and ,",
    "in which the weak localization correction and the fano factor are expressed in terms of classical propagators in which quantum correlations are still implicit .",
    "( vavilov and larkin pointed out how these implicit correlations can be made explicit;@xcite the resulting theory has a form equivalent to the one presented here . )    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1b ] we summarize the essential elements of the semiclassical formalism . in secs .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] , we first discuss the ehrenfest - time dependence of the fano factor and the weak localization correction to the dc conductance .",

    "[ sec:7 ] .",
    "in our calculation , we consider a ballistic conductor coupled to electron reservoirs through two ballistic contacts .",
    "transport is described using the scattering matrix @xmath32 .",
    "since there are two contacts , @xmath32 has a block structure @xmath33 , where the indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 label the two contacts , @xmath36 here and in the remainder of this article , primed variables refer to the exit contact .",
    "the dimension of the block @xmath37 is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of channels in the @xmath35th contact , @xmath40 ; the dimension of the full scattering matrix @xmath32 is @xmath41 .",
    "the conductance of the device is written @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dimensionless conductance , @xmath44 we are interested in the interference correction @xmath45 to the ensemble average @xmath46 , as well as the fluctuations of the conductance with respect to fluctuations of an external parameter that affects phases accumulated by the electrons , but not their classical dynamics .",
    "an example of such a parameter is the magnetic flux through an insulating region in the sample interior or the fermi energy for a device in which all scattering is from boundaries or scatterers with a sharp potential profile .",
    "( the conductance fluctuations with respect to variation of the classical dynamics has been considered , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .  .",
    ") we also consider the fano factor for the shot noise power,@xcite @xmath47 the fano factor is self - averaging , and may be calculated by taking the ensemble averages of numerator and denominator separately .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we calculate these observables in a semiclassical limit @xmath27 in which the ratio of the ehrenfest time @xmath0 and the dwell time @xmath5 is kept fixed .",
    "since @xmath0 grows logarithmically while sending @xmath27 , this means that @xmath5 must also grow when the limit @xmath27 is taken . as a result , the relevant time scales can be grouped into four well - separated categories .",
    "the smallest time scale is @xmath48 , the microscopic quantum time scale of the problem .",
    "the next set of time scales consists of the classical time scales that do not grow logarithmically with @xmath26 in this semiclassical limit , such as the lyapunov time @xmath30 or the elastic mean free time @xmath4",
    ". these separate the regime of the non - universal short - time electron dynamics and the universal long - time electron dynamics that eventually determines the universal magnitude of the signatures of quantum transport .",
    "the third group of time scales consists of @xmath5 and @xmath0 . in the semiclassical limit taken here ,",
    "these grow @xmath49 upon sending @xmath27 .",
    "the largest time scale is the heisenberg time @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mean level spacing , which grows @xmath52 .",
    "the results derived in the following three sections will be exact in the limit @xmath27 for this separation of time scales .",
    "it is the parametric separation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 that allows the use of coarse - grained classical propagators and removes the dependence on the non - universal short - time dynamics in the sample .",
    "= 0.8    one should note that , when taking the limit @xmath27 at fixed @xmath22 , the channel numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 and , hence , the conductance @xmath43 diverge .",
    "( this divergence is linked to the hierarcy discussed in the previous paragraph since @xmath55 . )",
    "the divergence of @xmath43 ensures that effects related to anderson localization can be ruled out .",
    "this divergence does not affect the quantities of interest to us , however , because the interference correction @xmath45 to the average conductance , the variance of the conductance , and the fano factor @xmath19 remain finite .",

    "is accompanied by a fast - varying phase factor which , if summed over , disappears in the semiclassical limit @xmath27.@xcite hence , we only need to consider the case of equal transverse momenta .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath27 , the summations over quantized transverse momenta @xmath69 and @xmath71 can be replaced by integrations . and",
    "third , locally the canonically conjugate coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath68 can be replaced by the conjugate coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are the stable and unstable phase space coordinates of the chaotic classical dynamics inside the conductor , defined for a poincar surface of section at the lead opening .",
    "we choose their units to be equal , so that both @xmath72 and @xmath73 have the same units as @xmath74 .",
    "this coordinate transformation is accompanied by a legendre transform of the classical action and the corresponding redefinition of the stability amplitude .",
    "the legendre transformed action @xmath75 is a function of the stable phase space coordinate @xmath76 upon entrance and the unstable phase space coordinate @xmath77 upon exit .",

    "in order to establish our methods and relevant approximations we first calculate the fano factor @xmath19 .",

    "a time - dependent bias requires one to consider products of the sample s scattering matrix @xmath32 at different energies.@xcite since small and spatially slow variations of an internal potential or a magnetic field do not alter classical trajectories , their effect can be included by a suitable modification of the classical action @xmath75 for each trajectory @xmath56.@xcite time - dependent internal potentials can be treated in a time - resolved semiclassical approach.@xcite in all cases , the only change to the theory as it is presented here is that one has to weigh the classical propagators with an additional phase factor representing the accumulated action differences .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the conductance fluctuations in a ballistic quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field were considered in ref .  .",
    "the situation is more complicated if one considers a potential internal to the sample that varies on sub - macroscopic length scales . such a potential may arise as a result of electron - electron interactions inside the sample,@xcite or it may represent residual point - like impurities .",
    "the complications arise because such a potential may alter the electron s trajectory .",
    "( potentials with spatial variations on macroscopic scale can not change the electron s momentum by more than @xmath442 .",
    "such small momentum changes have no consequences for times @xmath443 . )",

    "_ argued that a trajectory - based semiclassical approach still can be used as long as the potential is smooth on the spatial scale @xmath444 .",
