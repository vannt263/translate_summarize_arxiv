    "the behavior of quarkonium in a medium has been the object of many studies since it was realized that the medium may induce quarkonium dissociation and that the dissociation pattern of the different quarkonia may provide an effective thermometer of the medium  @xcite .",
    "how the medium influences the quarkonium and eventually leads to its dissociation is the problem that such studies address .    in recent years , new insight in the problem has been gained by studying low - lying quarkonia in a weakly - coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "low - lying quarkonia , like the bottomonium and charmonium ground states , are ( believed to be ) characterized by a typical inverse radius , which is of the order of @xmath6 , larger than the non - perturbative scale of qcd , @xmath7 , and a typical energy @xmath8 of the quarks in the bound state , which is of the order of @xmath9 , larger than or of the same order as @xmath7 .",
    "such states are coulombic . in the case of the bottomonium ground state , it is often also assumed that @xmath10 . in a weakly - coupled plasma ,",
    "both the temperature @xmath0 of the plasma and the screening mass , @xmath1 , are larger than @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the perturbative power counting implies that @xmath1 is suppressed with respect to @xmath0 , for @xmath11 shows up at one loop . with these specifications , observables describing low - lying quarkonia in a weakly - coupled quark - gluon plasma",
    "may be calculated to a large extent analytically in perturbation theory , which makes the interest of these systems . as we will argue later",
    ", this could be the case of the @xmath5 at the lhc .    in @xcite ,",
    "the perturbative quarkonium static potential was studied for quark - antiquark distances @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the surprising output of these studies has been that the imaginary part of the gluon self energy , which may be traced back to the landau - damping phenomenon , induces an imaginary part of the static potential and hence a thermal width of the static quark - antiquark bound state . in @xcite , static particles in a hot qed plasma were considered in the situation @xmath14 , confirming previous results . in @xcite ,",
    "the quarkonium static potential was first studied in an effective field theory ( eft ) framework that exploits systematically the hierarchy of different energy scales in the problem .",
    "the static potential was studied for distances that range from larger to smaller than @xmath15 and a new dissociation mechanism was identified .",
    "this is the color - singlet to color - octet break - up mechanism that provides the dominant contribution to the thermal decay width when @xmath16 . in @xcite ,",
    "moreover , the relation between the quarkonium potential and the correlation of two polyakov loops , a quantity often evaluated on the lattice , has been investigated .",
    "a comprehensive study of non - relativistic bound states in a hot qed plasma in a non - relativistic eft framework was performed in @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that quarkonium melts at temperatures larger than the melting temperature , @xmath17 , defined as the temperature for which the thermal decay width becomes as large as the binding energy ; parametrically , it holds that @xmath18 .",
    "since this temperature is lower than the temperature at which screening sets in , i.e. the temperature at which @xmath1 is of the size of the inverse of the radius of the bound state , this finding challenges the long - time accepted view that quarkonium remains dissociated in a medium as long as color is screened ; in fact , the existence of the melting temperature implies that quarkonium remains dissociated at lower temperatures , experiencing a larger dissociation rate .    in the following",
    ", we will report about the results of @xcite , where , in a specific range of temperatures , the spectrum and widths of quarkonia up to order @xmath4 have been computed . in the assumed range of parameters , the scales of the bound state ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 ) and the thermodynamical scales ( @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 ) fulfill a specific hierarchy that we will exploit either by constructing a corresponding hierarchy of efts or by subsequently integrating out different momentum regions .",
    "we consider quarkonium in a thermal bath , whose energy scales satisfy the following hierarchy : @xmath19 this implies that @xmath20 and that @xmath21 is lower than @xmath22 , i.e. quarkonium exists in the plasma .",
    "we will further assume that all these scales are larger than @xmath7 and that a weak - coupling expansion is possible for all of them .",
    "finally , in order to produce an expression for the spectrum that is accurate up to order @xmath4 , we will assume that @xmath23 ^ 4 \\ll g$ ] .",
    "it is not clear if this hierarchy is realized by any of the quarkonium states at present heavy - ion facilities .",
    "possible candidates are the bottomonium @xmath24 states ( @xmath5 , @xmath25 ) at the lhc , for which it may hold @xmath26 .",
    "it is useful to work in the so - called real - time formalism , which amounts to modifying the temporal integration in the partition function to include real times . as a consequence ,",
    "the degrees of freedom double .",
    "however , the doubling of the degrees of freedom affects only gluon loops ( at the order we are working only the gluon self energy ) , while physical heavy quarks decouple from unphysical ones @xcite , so the price to pay is minimal .",
    "the advantage is that the real - time formalism allows a treatment of the quarkonium in the thermal bath very similar to the eft framework developed for zero temperature @xcite .",
    "many results obtained there may , indeed , be simply translated here .",
    "the eft that follows from qcd by integrating out gluons and quarks of energy or momentum of order @xmath3 in the quark - antiquark sector is non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the eft that follows from nrqcd by integrating out gluons of energy or momentum of order @xmath6 is potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) @xcite . according to the hierarchy ,",
    "both these scales are larger than @xmath0 , which , therefore , may be set to zero in the matching to the eft . as a consequence ,",
    "the lagrangians of nrqcd and pnrqcd are the same as at zero temperature .",
    "integrating out @xmath0 from pnrqcd modifies pnrqcd into hard - thermal loop ( htl ) pnrqcd , pnrqcd@xmath27 , @xcite . with respect to pnrqcd",
