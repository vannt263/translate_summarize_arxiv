    "electrons and positrons are stored at equal energies in oppositely rotating orbits in the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , and they collide at a 2  mrad angle at the center of the cleo  iii detector @xcite . charged tracks are reconstructed in a 4-layer silicon strip detector and a 47-layer wire drift chamber , and their momenta are determined from their radii of curvature in a 1.5  t magnetic field created by a superconducting solenoid with its axis aligned along the average of the two colliding beam lines .",
