    "higgs bosons @xcite play an important role in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite ; they are responsible for generating the masses of all the elementary particles ( leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) . however , the higgs - boson sector is the least tested one in the sm .",
    "if higgs bosons are responsible for breaking the symmetry from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , it is natural to expect that other higgs bosons are also involved in breaking other symmetries .",
    "one of the more attractive extensions of the sm is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , mainly because of its capacity to solve the naturalness and hierarchy problems while maintaining the higgs bosons elementary .",
    "the theoretical frame work of this paper is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , which doubles the spectrum of particles of the sm and the new free parameters obey simple relations .",
    "the scalar sector of the mssm @xcite requires two higgs doublets , thus the remaining scalar spectrum contains the following physical states : two cp - even higgs scalar ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 , one cp - odd higgs scalar ( @xmath17 ) and a charged higgs pair ( @xmath18 ) , whose detection would be a clear signal of new physics .",
    "the higgs sector is specified at tree - level by fixing two parameters , which can be chosen as the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath19 and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two doublets @xmath20 , then the mass @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the mixing angle of the neutral higgs sector @xmath24 can be fixed . however , since radiative corrections produce substantial effects on the predictions of the model @xcite , it is necessary to specify also the squark masses , which are assumed to be degenerated . in this paper , we focus on the phenomenology of the neutral cp - even and cp - odd scalar ( @xmath3 ) and charged @xmath25 .",
    "the search for these scalars has begun at lep , and current low energy bound on their masses gives @xmath21 , @xmath19 @xmath26 90 @xmath8 and @xmath27 @xmath26 120 @xmath8 for @xmath5 @xmath26 1 @xcite . at @xmath6",
    "colliders the signals for higgs bosons are relatively clean and the opportunities for discovery and detailed study will be excellent .",
    "the most important processes for the production and detection of the neutral and charged higgs bosons @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath4 , are : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( the later is conventionally referred to as @xmath31 fusions ) , and @xmath32 @xcite ; precise cross - section formulas appear in ref .",
    "the main decay modes of the neutral higgs particles are in general @xmath33 decays @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays @xmath36 which are easy to detect experimentally at @xmath37 colliders @xcite .",
    "charged higgs particles decay predominantly into @xmath38 and @xmath39 pairs .    in previous studies , the two - body processes of the neutral and charged higgs bosons @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "have been evaluated @xcite extensively .",
    "however , the inclusion of three - body process with heavy fermions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xcite and @xmath45 @xcite at future @xmath37 colliders energies @xcite is necessary in order to know its impact on the two - body mode processes and also to search for new relations that could have a cleaner signature of the higgs bosons production .    in the present paper",
    "we study the production of susy higgs bosons at @xmath6 colliders .",
    "we are interested in finding regions that could allow the detection of the susy higgs bosons for the set parameter space @xmath46 .",
    "we shall discuss the neutral and charged higgs bosons production @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 in the energy range of a future @xmath37 collider @xcite for large values of the parameter @xmath5 , where one expects to have a high production .",
    "since the coupling @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath51 , the cross - section will receive a large enhancement factor when @xmath5 is large .",
    "similar situation occurs for @xmath15 , whose coupling with @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "the couplings of @xmath17 with @xmath33 and of @xmath4 with @xmath53 are directly proportional to @xmath5 , thus the amplitudes will always grow with @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level and use the helicity formalism @xcite for the evaluation of the amplitudes .",
    "succinctly , our aim in this work is to analyze how much the results of the bjorken mechanism [ fig . 1 , ( 1.4 ) ] would be enhanced by the contribution from the diagrams depicted in figs .",
    "1.1 - 1.3 , 1.5 and 1.6 in which the susy higgs bosons are radiated by a @xmath54 quark .",
    "for the case of the charged higgs bosons the two - body mode [ figs .",
    "3.1 and 3.4 ] would be enhanced by the contribution from the diagrams depicted in figs .",
    "3.2 , 3.3 , and 3.5 , in which the charged higgs boson is radiated by a @xmath55 @xmath56 lepton .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for large values of @xmath5 the detection of susy higgs bosons is possible at fnal and lhc @xcite . in the papers cited in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors calculated the corresponding three - body diagrams for hadron collisions .",
    "they pointed out the importance of a large bottom yukawa coupling at hadron colliders and showed that the tevatron collider may be a good place for detecting susy higgs bosons . in the case of the hadron",
    "colliders the three - body diagrams come from gluon fusion and this fact makes the contribution from these diagrams more important , due to the gluon abundance inside the hadrons .",
    "the advantage for the case of @xmath57 colliders is that the signals of the processes are cleaner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "ii the relevant details of the calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we evaluate cross section for the processes @xmath58 and @xmath45 at future @xmath37 colliders .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv contains our conclusions .",
    "when the number of feynman diagrams is increased , the calculation of the amplitude is a rather unpleasant task . some algebraic forms @xcite can be used in it to avoid manual calculation , but sometimes the lengthy printed output from the computer is overwhelming , and one can hardly find the required results from it .",
    "the calkul collaboration @xcite suggested the helicity amplitude method ( ham ) which can simplify the calculation remarkably and hence make the manual calculation realistic .    in this section",
    "we describe in brief the evaluation of the amplitudes at tree - level , for @xmath1 and @xmath45 using the ham @xcite .",
    "this method is a powerful technique for computing helicity amplitudes for multiparticle processes involving massless spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles .",
    "generalization of this method that incorporates massive spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles , is given in ref .",
    "this algebra is easy to program and more efficient than computing the dirac algebra .",
    "a higgs boson @xmath59 , @xmath17 , and @xmath4 can be produced in scattering @xmath6 via the following processes :    @xmath60    the diagrams of feynman , which contribute at tree - level to the different reaction mechanisms , are depicted in figs",
    ".    however those diagrams with exchange of higgs bosons instead of gauge bosons ( photon or @xmath61 ) have been neglected because of the smallness of the higgs fermion coupling . using the feynman rules given by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can write the amplitudes for these reactions . for the evaluation of the amplitudes we have used the spinor - helicity technique of xu , zhang and chang @xcite ( denoted henceforth by xzc ) , which is a modification of the technique developed by the calkul collaboration @xcite .",
    "following xzc , we introduce a very useful notation for the calculation of the processes ( 1)-(4 )",
    ". the complete formulas of the processes ( 1)-(3 ) are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the case of process ( 4 ) , are given in ref .",
    "we are going to use the same notation and the formulas given in @xcite and do not reproduce them here .",
    "after writing down the feynman diagrams corresponding to a given amplitude @xmath62 an usually proceeds to derive an analytic expression for the cross section @xmath63 , with an appropriate spin and/or color sum or average .",
    "the result , which is usually a function of minkowsky products of the particle four - momenta , is then evaluated numerically at phase - space points in the region of interest .",
    "it is clear that any method which evaluates @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 will eventually become superior to the standard approach . indeed , several authors have stressed this point and proposed alternatives .",
    "we want to argue that it is useful to employ in the evaluation of the amplitude not vector products like @xmath64 but rather spinor products like @xmath65 .",
    "after the evaluation of the amplitudes of the corresponding diagrams , we obtain the cross - sections of the analyzed processes for each point of the phase space using eqs .",
    "( 12)-(17 ) , ( 23)-(28 ) and ( 11)-(15 ) @xcite by a computer program , which makes use of the subroutine rambo ( random momenta beautifully organized ) @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this procedure in comparison to the traditional  trace technique \" are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the breit - wigner propagators for the @xmath66 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosons . for the sm parameters we adopted the following : @xmath67 @xmath8 , @xmath68 @xmath8 , @xmath69 @xmath8 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath8 , @xmath72 @xmath8 , @xmath73 , which are taken as inputs .",

    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams ( figs . 1 - 3 ) at tree - level and utilize the helicity formalism for the evaluation of their amplitudes . in the next subsections ,",
    "we present our results for the case of the different higgs bosons .      in order to illustrate our results on the production of the @xmath14 higgs boson , we present graphs of the cross section as functions of @xmath17 higgs boson mass @xmath19 , assuming @xmath77 @xmath8 , @xmath78 @xmath8 and @xmath79 for nlc .",
