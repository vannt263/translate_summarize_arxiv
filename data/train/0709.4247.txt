    "using _ iras _ data , more than a hundred main - sequence stars have been found to have excess emission in the @xmath6 - @xmath7 spectral range @xcite .",
    "many additional examples have been discovered with _",
    "iso _ and _ spitzer_. in most cases the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) can be fitted by models of circumstellar debris systems of thermally radiating dust grains with temperatures of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "such grains have short lifetimes around stars : they either get ground down into tiny dust particles that are then ejected by radiation pressure , or if their number density is low they are brought into the star by poynting - robertson drag .",
    "since excesses are observed around stars that are much older than the time scale for these clearing mechanisms , it is necessary that the dust be replenished through collisions between planetesimals and the resulting collisional cascades of the products of these events both with themselves and with other bodies .",
    "thus , planetary debris disks are a means to study processes occurring in hundreds of neighboring planetary systems .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations are revealing a general resemblance in evolutionary time scales and other properties to the events hypothesized to have occurred in the early solar system .",
    "although the planetary debris disk hypothesis appears to account for a large majority of the far infrared excesses around main - sequence stars , there are two alternative possibilities .",
    "the first is that very hot gas around the stars is responsible for free - free emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second possibility is that the excesses arise through heating of dust grains in the interstellar medium around the star , but not in a bound structure such as a debris disk .",
    "@xcite noticed optical reflection nebulosities around a number of stars with vega - like excesses .",
    "these nebulosities show asymmetries that would not be typical of disks , they have complex , often striated structures that are reminiscent of the pleiades reflection nebulosities , and they are much too large in extent to be gravitationally bound to the stars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "originally , it was proposed that ism dust grains could interact directly with material in debris disks @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that photon pressure from the star would repel interstellar grains , resulting in grain - free zones with possible bow - shock geometry around luminous stars @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been proposed to account for the abundance anomalies associated with @xmath5 botis stars .",
    "these are late b to early f - type , population i stars with surface underabundances of most fe - peak elements and solar abundances of lighter elements , such as c , n , o and s. in the diffusion / accretion model @xcite , it is suggested that the abundance anomaly occurs when a star passes through a diffuse interstellar cloud .",
    "the radiation pressure repels the grains , and hence much of the general ism metals , while the gas is accreted onto the stellar surface .",
    "while the star is within the cloud , a mid - infrared excess will result from the heating of the interstellar dust ; however , after the star has left the cloud the abundance anomalies may persist for @xmath18 in its surface layers @xcite without an accompanying infrared excess .",
    "there have been few opportunities to test the predictions for dynamical interactions of main - sequence stars with the ambient interstellar medium . @xcite",

    "@xmath22 emission maps .",
    "@xcite discovered that the young b5 star hd 281159 is interacting with the ism , producing spherical shells of extended ir emission centered on the star with a spike feature pointing from the star into the shells .",
    "none of these cases correspond to the type of situation that might be mistaken for a debris disk , nor which would be expected to produce a @xmath5 botis abundance pattern .",
    "@xmath0 velorum is a nearby ( @xmath23 ) stellar system ( at least five members ) , with modest excess in the _ iras _ data .",

    "@xcite observed a drop in the primary component s brightness ( @xmath24 ) and showed that it is an eclipsing binary with probably two a spectral type components . with the available data , @xcite computed the system s parameters .",
    "they suggested that the eclipsing binary ( aa ) consists of two a dwarfs with spectral types a1v and a5v and masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and with separation of @xmath27 mas .",
    "the nearby b component is a g dwarf with mass around @xmath28 and separation of @xmath29 from the main component .",
    "there is also another binary ( cd component ) at @xmath30 from the star .    in  2",
    ", we report measurements demonstrating that this star is producing a bow shock as it moves through an interstellar cloud as hypothesized by @xcite . in  3 , we model this behavior using simple dust grain parameters and show satisfactory agreement with expectations for the ism and properties of the star .",
    "we discuss these results in  4 , where we show that the star is most likely not part of the @xmath5 botis stellar class .",
    "thus , @xmath0 velorum provides a test of the diffusion / accretion hypothesis for @xmath5 botis behavior .",
    "we present observations of @xmath0 velorum at @xmath31 and @xmath2 obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) as part of three programs : pid 57 ( 2004 feb 21 ) , pid 20296 ( 2006 feb 22 , apr 3 ) and pid 30566 ( 2006 june 12 ) . for pid 57",

    "the other observations at @xmath1 ( pid 20296 ) were done in standard photometry mode with 4 cycles at 5 sub - pixel - offset cluster positions and 3 sec integrations , resulting in a total integration of 902 sec on source for each of the two epochs .",

    "the observation at @xmath2 ( pid 30566 ) was done in standard photometry default - scale mode with 10 sec integrations and 3 cycles , resulting in a total integration of 335 sec on source .",

    "the model described later demands flux measurements within a constant large external radius ( see details in  3 ) .",
    "therefore , photometry for the target was extracted using aperture photometry with a single aperture setting .",
    "the center for the aperture photometry at both @xmath31 and @xmath2 was determined by fitting and centroiding a 2-d gaussian core .",
    "a radius of @xmath38 was used for both wavelengths , with sky annulus between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the aperture size was chosen to be large enough to contain most of the flux from the bow shock , but small enough to exclude the cd component to avoid contamination .",
    "the cd component was bright at @xmath1 at a distance of @xmath30 from the aab components , but could not be detected at @xmath2 .",
    "aperture corrections were not applied because of the large size of the aperture .",
    "conversion factors of @xmath41 and @xmath42 were used to transfer measured instrumental units to physical units at @xmath31 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "faint extended asymmetric nebulosity offset from the central star is apparent at @xmath1 , with the dark airy rings partially filled in .",
    "using standard aperture and point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry optimized for a point source , the total flux is @xmath43 @xmath44 times the expected photospheric flux , which was determined by fitting a kurucz model @xcite to the optical and near infrared photometry and extrapolating it to @xmath31 and @xmath2 . the large aperture photometry value is greater by another factor of @xmath45 , which puts it above the expected photospheric flux by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "the final photometry measurements ( using the large aperture setting ) are listed in table [ tab : par ] .",
    "we also list the modeled photospheric flux of the star and the modeled value of the ir excess .",
    "since the measured excess depends on the aperture used , to avoid confusion we do not give a measured excess value , only the photospheric flux which can be subtracted from any later measurements . the photospheric flux given in table [ tab : par ]",
    "does not include the contribution from the g dwarf ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 at @xmath31 and @xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "the top left panel in figure 1 shows the summed image from epochs 2 and 3 , to demonstrate the asymmetry suggested even before psf subtraction .",
    "for the first epoch @xmath1 image , the reference star image was subtracted from the image of @xmath0 velorum , with a scale factor chosen as the maximum value that would completely remove the image core without creating significant negative flux residuals .",
    "the deeper exposures from the second and third epochs were designed to reveal faint structures far from the star , where the observed psf is difficult to extract accurately .",
    "therefore , we used simulated psfs ( from stinytim @xcite ) and the mips simulator . because bright structures nearly in the psf contribute to the residuals at large distances , we oversubtracted the psf to compensate .",
    "the first epoch psf subtracted @xmath1 image is shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : im ] and the composite from epochs 2 and 3 in the upper right .    the psf subtracted images in figure [ fig : im ] show that the asymmetry is caused by a bow shock . as shown in the lower left , the head of the bow shock points approximately toward the direction of the stellar proper motion .",

    "the total flux of the residual of the psf subtracted image is @xmath55 .",
    "the intensity contours ( _ last panel _ ) suggest that the @xmath2 excess fades at the cavity behind the star , but the effect is small .",
    "the geometry and direction of the bow shock are discussed in more detail in  3.2 .",
    "based on a previous suggestion by @xcite , @xcite proposed a physical model to explain the abundance pattern of @xmath5 botis stars through star - ism interaction and the diffusion / accretion hypothesis . their model is based on a luminous main - sequence star passing through a diffuse ism cloud .",
    "the star blows the interstellar dust grains away by its radiation pressure , but accretes the interstellar gas onto its surface , thus establishing a thin surface layer with abundance anomalies .",
    "so long as the star is inside the cloud , the dust grains are heated to produce excess in the infrared above the photospheric radiation of the star .",
    "martnez - galarza et al .",
    "( 2007 , in prep . ) have developed a model of this process and show that the global spectral energy distributions of a group of @xmath5 botis type stars that have infrared excesses are consistent with the emission from the hypothesized ism cloud .",
    "details of the model can be found in their paper .",
    "here we adapt their model and improve its fidelity ( e.g. , with higher resolution integrations ) , and also model the surface brightness distribution to describe the observed bow shock seen around @xmath0 velorum .",
    "the phenomenon of star - ism interactions generating bow shocks was first studied by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the radiative pressure force on a sub - micron dust grain can be many times that of the gravitational force as it approaches the star .",
    "the scattering surface will be a parabola with the star at the focus point of the parabolic shaped dust cavity .",
    "since the star heats the grains outside of the cavity and close to the parabolic surface , an infrared - emitting bow shock feature is expected .",
    "the shape of the parabola ( for each grain size ) can be given in terms of the distance between the star ( focus ) and the vertex .",
    "this so - called avoidance radius ( or the @xmath56 parameter of the scattering parabola ) can be calculated from energy conservation to be @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the radius of the particle , @xmath59 is the mass of the star and @xmath60 is the relative velocity between the star and the dust grains .",
    "@xmath61 is the ratio of photon pressure to gravitational force on a grain and it is given by @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath0 is the bulk density of the grain material and @xmath63 is the radiation pressure efficiency averaged over the stellar spectrum .",
    "@xmath64 can be expressed in terms of grain properties ( absorption coefficient @xmath65 , scattering coefficient @xmath66 and the scattering asymmetry factor @xmath67 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath68 which gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the planck function .",
    "we adopted astronomical silicates in our model with @xmath71 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we considered a mrn @xcite grain size distribution in our model : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a scaling constant and @xmath74 is the number density of the cloud with @xmath75 and grain sizes ranging from @xmath76  @xmath77 .    with these equations we are able to model the avoidance cavity for a grain that encounters a star with known mass , luminosity and relative velocity .",
    "the model describes a situation where the expelled grains are instantly removed from the system rather than drifting away , but this only causes a minor discrepancy in the wing and almost none in the apex of the parabola compared to the actual case . in the actual scenario only those particles get scattered back upstream that encounter the central star with small impact parameter ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this means that most of the grains will get expelled toward the wings , where the grains go further out and emit less infrared excess , thus their contribution to the total flux will be small .",
    "the model determines the number density of certain grain sizes and the position of their parabolic avoidance cavity . outside of the cavity we assumed a constant number density distribution for each grain size .",
    "to calculate the surface brightness of the system and its sed we assumed a thermal equilibrium condition , with wavelength dependent absorption and an optically thin cloud .",
    "the model described in  3.1 gives the distribution and temperature for each grain size .",
    "this model was implemented in two ansi c programs .",
    "the first program fits the sed of the system to the observed photometry points , while the second program calculates the surface brightness of the system .",
    "the fitted photometry included uvby , ubv , _ hipparcos _ v band , 2mass , _ iras _ and mips ( @xmath31 and @xmath2 ) data .",
    "we subtracted the @xmath31 and @xmath2 flux contributed by the g star ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) from the mips observations , because we wanted to model the system consisting of the two a stars and the bow shock .",
    "is the rotation angle of the system on the plane of the sky ( our initial guess was @xmath79",
    "n from the calculated direction of relative motion shown in figure [ fig : im ] ) , @xmath80 is the inclination and @xmath81 is an avoidance radius .",
    "the observer is viewing from the axis pointing to the bottom left . ]",
    "the input parameters are : stellar radius , mass - to - luminosity ratio ( mlr ) , relative velocity of cloud and star , ism dust density , cloud external radius and the distance of the system .",
    "the stellar radius , mlr and the distance can be constrained easily .",
    "we determined the best - fit kurucz model @xcite by fitting the photometry points at wavelengths shorter than @xmath82 .",
    "since the distance is known to high accuracy from _ hipparcos _ we can determine the radius and thus the luminosity of the star precisely .",
    "the mass was adopted from @xcite .",
    "the g dwarf s luminosity is only 1% of the system , so leaving the star out does not cause any inconsistency .",
    "its mass is only 17% of the total mass , which can only cause minor changes in the determined final relative velocity , but none in the final surface brightness or the computed ism density .",
    "the model then has three variable parameters : the density of the ism grains ( @xmath83 - does not include gas ) , the relative velocity between the cloud and the star ( @xmath60 ) and the external radius of the cloud ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the model should describe the total flux from exactly the area used for our photometry .",
    "the aperture radius of @xmath38 ( @xmath85 at the stellar distance of @xmath86 ) was used as @xmath84 .",
    "both programs calculate the @xmath63 , @xmath61 , @xmath87 , @xmath74 values and then the temperature at @xmath87 for each grain size .",
    "the sed modeling program decreases the temperature value from the one at @xmath88 by @xmath89 steps and finds the radius for that corresponding grain temperature .",
    "the program does not include geometrical parameters such as the inclination or the rotation angle of the system , since these are irrelevant in calculating the total flux .",
    "it calculates the contribution to the emitting flux for every grain size from every shell to an external radius ( @xmath84 ) and adds them up according to wavelength .    the program that calculates the surface brightness uses a similar algorithm as the sed program , but it calculates the temperature at @xmath90 distance steps from @xmath87 for every grain size and calculates the total flux in the line of sight in @xmath91 resolution elements .    the total inclination @xmath80 of the bow shock was not included as a parameter , since by eye the observed images seemed to show an inclination of @xmath92 ( a schematic plot of the angle nomenclature is shown in figure [ fig : angles ] ) .",
    "this approximation is strengthened by the radial velocity of the star , which is only @xmath93 compared to the tangential velocity of @xmath94 .",
    "this assures that the motion of the system is close to perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "however , we have found that the bow shock has similar appearance for a significant range of angles ( @xmath95 ) relative to @xmath96 .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ fig : slides ] .",
    "if the relative velocity vector would have a @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) inclination it would only cause minor differences in the modeled velocity ( @xmath99 ) and ism density ( @xmath100 ) . at an inclination of @xmath101 ,",
    "the `` wings '' spread out and the bright rim at the apex starts to become thin .",
    "with interstellar feii and mgii measurements @xcite showed that the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath102 moving towards the galactic coordinate @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath0 velorum is at @xmath105 , @xmath106 , the lic is also moving perpendicular to our line of sight at the star and in the direction needed to reach a high relative velocity between the star and cloud .",
    "@xcite showed a low velocity interstellar ca k line component in the star s spectrum with @xmath107 , which also proves that the ism s motion is perpendicular to our line of sight at @xmath0 velorum .",
    "the offset of the proper motion direction of the star from the head direction of the bow shock by a few degrees could be explained by the ism velocity .",
    "a simple vectorial summation of the star and the ism velocities should give a net motion in the direction of the bow shock .",
    "as a function of grain size .",
    "the solid lines are curves for a silicate bulk density of @xmath108 , while the dashed ones are for @xmath109 .",
    "the curves are for @xmath60 values of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 from top to bottom , respectively . ]",
    "we first tried to find the best fitting sed to the photometry points corresponding to wavelengths larger than @xmath82 ( mips , _ iras _ ) with @xmath115 minimization in the @xmath60 vs.  @xmath83 phase space .",
    "we defined @xmath115 as : @xmath116 the @xmath115 phase space with @xmath117 showed no minimum ( figure [ fig : chi ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the interpretation of the diagram is as follows : if the relative velocity is small , then the avoidance radius will be large .",
    "consequently the grains will be at relatively low temperature and the amount of dust required to produce the observed flux increases . on the other hand , if the relative velocity is large , then the grains can approach closer to the star and heat up to higher temperatures . as a result",
    "a smaller dust density is enough to produce the observed flux .",
    "therefore , the combination of the density of the cloud and the relative velocity can be well constrained by the broad - band sed alone , but not each separately .    by using surface brightness values from the observations and the model calculations we were able to determine the @xmath60 parameter and thus eliminate the degeneracy of the model . since the bow shock is a parabolic feature it has only one variable , the avoidance radius ( @xmath87 ) , which is the same as the @xmath56 parameter of the parabola ( with @xmath118 being the distance between the focus point and the vertex ) . the value of @xmath87 does change as a function of grain size , but the head of the bow shock will be near the value where the avoidance radius has its maximum as a function of grain size .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : ravvsgr ] , the avoidance radius has a maximum at @xmath119 grain size .",
    "the value of the avoidance radius on the other hand only depends on the relative velocity between the ism cloud and the star .",
    "this way we can constrain the second parameter of the model ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the relative velocity has to be set so that the avoidance radius of the @xmath119 grain is around half the parabola parameter value .",
    "this method gives a value that only approximates the true one , but it can be used as an initial guess .",
    "the @xmath60 parameter was constrained by comparing the psf subtracted image `` wings '' with model images . within a range of @xmath120 of our initial",
    "guess ( @xmath121 ) with @xmath122 steps , we generated images of the surface brightness distribution to a radius of @xmath123 .",
    "the computational time for a total @xmath124 data cube was long , so we only calculated to a depth of @xmath125 , keeping the field of view ( fov ) @xmath126 .",
    "the fluxes of the generated images were normalized ( to ensure that the geometry was the main constraint of the fit and not surface brightness variations ) and rotated to angles @xmath127 with @xmath128 steps .",
    "after rotation , both the model images and the observed image were masked with zeros where there was no detectable surface brightness in the observed image .",

    "the @xmath115 of the deviations of the model from the observed image were calculated .",
    "we were able to constrain the rotation angle of the model and the relative velocity of the cloud to the star .",
    "the @xmath115 values in the @xmath131 vs.  @xmath60 phase space are shown in figure [ fig : bestrot ] ( _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the small values at large rotation angles are artifacts due to the masking .",
    "the best - fit rotation angle is at @xmath132 to our initial guess , which means that the direction of motion is @xmath133 ( ccw ) of n. this is just @xmath134 from the proper motion direction .",

    "this @xmath83 is an upper estimate of the actual value , since the model computes what density would be needed to give the observed brightness using a @xmath84 radius sphere .",
    "since the line - of - sight distribution of the dust is not cut off at @xmath84 , we used @xmath144 as an initial guess ; a range of density values was explored with model images .    since the surface brightness scales with the density , only one image had to be computed , which could be scaled afterwards with a constant factor .",
