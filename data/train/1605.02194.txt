    "one of the remaining class of puzzling astronomical objects is active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "the energy released by agn in the interstellar medium has long been invoked by simulation studies to explain the quenching of star formation activity in massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "evidence for active feedback has also been brought by observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the most common scenario is that gas - rich galaxy mergers trigger agn activity , which in turn quenches star formation @xcite .",

    "most of the aforementioned studies focused on agn selected from their x ray emission or ultraviolet / optical emission lines . while successful , these studies are biased against heavily obscured agn ( which can be detected in the far - infrared ) , and low luminosity agn , where the contribution of the host galaxy can be of the same order or larger than that of the agn . with the advent of large time domain surveys such as ps .",
    "@xcite , and the upcoming lsst @xcite , a new window is opening for building large samples of agn using variability as a complementary selection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the sample of @xcite is limited at @xmath148 , which corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath149 , assuming a bolometric correction of 10 .",
    "given the good correlation we observe between @xmath150 and sfr ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sfr_lagn ] ) , this luminosity cut explains why @xcite do not observe any agn within the red sequence . in this context , @xcite showed that it is essential to properly take into account selection effects to discuss the relation between agn and host properties .",

    "a large number of studies have focused on the link between agn and sfr activity , as agn feedback has been shown in simulations to be a promising mechanism to quench star formation in galaxies , and explain the global trends in galaxy evolution since @xmath153 .",

    "it is clear that agn can inject in the intergalactic medium significant amounts of energy that can prevent further gas from cooling @xcite .",

    "one possibility is that our sed fitting procedure would erroneously mistake moderate levels of star formation for moderate levels of agn activity .",

    "we note however that there are some discrepancies between these simulations and the observations . for instance",

    "+ in summary , our results suggest that for @xmath157 there is a good correlation between agn host sfr and @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that the black hole accretion rates are also well correlated with sfr .",
    "these results are consistent with the picture that agn hosts experience secular evolution , and that black holes are mostly fueled by the same mechanisms that fuel star formation events .",
    "we visually inspected the objects in our sample with higher sfrs , and did not find any merger or interaction signatures .",
    "this does not mean that mergers or interactions do not trigger agn activity , but rather it suggests that these events are not the main channels for agn accretion .",
