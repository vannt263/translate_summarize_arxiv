    "over the last decade there has emerged growing interest in the so - called warm dense matter ( wdm ) , which is of key importance for the description of , e.g. , astrophysical systems @xcite , laser - excited solids @xcite , and inertial confinement fusion targets @xcite .",
    "the wdm regime is characterized by the simultaneous occurence of strong ( moderate ) correlations of ions ( electrons ) , thermal effects as well as quantum effects of the electrons . in dimensionless units ,",
    "typical parameters are the brueckner parameter @xmath0 and the reduced temperature @xmath1 , both being of the order of unity ( more generally in the range @xmath2 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the mean interparticle distance and the bohr radius , respectively .",
    "a third relevant parameter is the classical coupling parameter of the ionic component , @xmath5 which is often larger than unity indicating that the ionic component is far from an ideal gas .",
    "this makes the theoretical description of this peculiar state of matter particularly challenging , as there is no small parameter to perform an expansion around .    in the ground state",
    ", there exists a large toolkit of approaches that allow for the accurate description of manifold physical systems , the most successful of which arguably being kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of dft is to map the complicated and computationally demanding quantum many - body problem onto an effective single - particle problem",
    ". this would be exact if the correct exchange - correlation functional of the system of interest was available which is , of course , not the case . in practice , therefore , one has to use an approximation .",
    "the foundation of the great success of dft has been the local density approximation ( lda ) , i.e. , the usage of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath6 of the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) with the same density as the more complicated system of interest .",
    "accurate data for @xmath6 of the ueg was obtained by ceperley and alder @xcite using a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method , from which perdew and zunger @xcite constructed a simple parametrization with respect to density , @xmath7 , that is still used to this day .",
    "however , the accurate description of warm dense matter requires to extend dft to finite temperature .",
    "this has been realized long ago by mermin @xcite who used a superposition of excited states weighted with their thermal occupation probability .",
    "a strict approach to the thermodynamic properties of this system also requires an appropriate finite - temperature extension of the lda , in particular replacement of the ground state energy functionals by free energies , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "this means , a finite - temperature version of the lda requires accurate parametrizations of the _ exchange correlation free energy _ with respect to temperature and density @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9 , even though in some cases the entropic correction maybe small .",
    "this seemingly benign task , however , turns out to be far from trivial because accurate date for the free energy are much more involved than the ground state results .",
    "while for the ground state reliable qmc data are known for a long time , until recently @xcite , the notorious fermion sign problem @xcite has prevented reliable qmc simulations in the warm dense regime .",
    "therefore , during the recent four decades many theoretical approaches to @xmath9 have been developed that lead to a variety of parametrizations , for an overview on early works , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "some of them have gained high popularity and they were successfully applied in many fields , even though there accuracy has remained poorly tested .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to present such a quantitative comparison of earlier models to new simulation results .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : free ] , we introduce a selection of such functions .",
    "first , we analyze the purely analytical expression presented by ebeling and co - workers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "next , we study functional fits to linear response data based on static local field correction schemes that were suggested by singwi , tosi , land , and sjlander ( stls ) @xcite ( sec .",

    "however , those data have a limited accuracy due to ( i ) the usage of the fixed node approximation @xcite and ( ii ) an inappropriate finite - size correction ( see @xcite ) giving rise to systematic errors in the free energy results as we will show below . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we compare all aforementioned parametrizations of @xmath10 to the new , accurate qmc data by dornheim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that are free from any systematic bias , and , hence , allow us to gauge the accuracy of models .",
    "a particular emphasis is laid on the warm dense matter regime .",
    "the idea to produce an analytical formula for the thermodynamic quantities that connect known analyitical limits via a smooth pad approximant is due to ebeling , kraeft , richert and co - workers @xcite .",
    "these approximations have been quite influential in the description of nonideal plasmas and electron - hole plasmas in the 1980s and 1990s receiving , in part , a substantial amount of citations .",
    "these approximations have been improved continuously in the following years , and we , therefore , only discuss the more recent versions , cf .",

    ", @xmath64 is in qualitative agreement with the correct results , but the deviations rapidly increase with density and exceed @xmath65 , for @xmath42 . at higher temperature , @xmath58 , the situation is worse , and the ebeling parametrization shows systematic deviations over the entire density range .",
    "the stls fit displays a similarly impressive agreement with the exact data as for the @xmath28-dependence ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : theta ] ) , and the deviations do not exceed @xmath66 for both depicted @xmath28-values . on the other hand ,",
    "the vs results are again significantly less accurate than stls although the deviation remains below @xmath67 for both temperatures .",
    "further , we notice that the largest deviations occur for @xmath68 , i.e. , towards stronger coupling , which is expected since here the pair distribution function exhibits unphysical negative values at short distance , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "again , the incorporation of the csr has not improved the quality of the interaction energy or the structure factor compared to stls . the classical mapping data ( pdw ) does exhibit deviations not exceeding @xmath69 for @xmath70 , i.e. , in the range where numerical data have been incorporated into the fit .",
    "overall , the quality of this parametrization is comparable to the vs - curve although the relative deviation appears to be almost constant with respect to the density .",
    "this is not surprising as the approximation has not been conducted with respect to coupling ( the effective classical system is solved with the hypernetted chain method , which is expected to be accurate in this regime ) but , instead , in the interpolation of the effective temperature @xmath71 .",
    "further , we notice a peculiar non - smooth and almost oscillatory behavior of @xmath72 around @xmath73 that is more pronounced for @xmath61 and the origin of which remains unclear .",

    "@xcite ( a similar analysis for more temperatures can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath61 ,",
    "this parametrization is in excellent agreement with the reference qmc data and the deviations are in the sub - percent regime over the entire depicted @xmath17-range .",

    "interestingly , these deviations only vanish for @xmath75",
    ". naturally , the inaccuracies of the ksdt - fit are a direct consequence of the systematic errors of the input data and the lack of accurate simulation data for @xmath63 , prior to ref .  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have compared five different parametrizations of the exchange - correlation free energy of the unpolarized ueg to the recent qmc data by dornheim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and , thereby , have been able to gauge their accuracy with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath17 over large parts of the warm dense matter regime .",
    "we underline that all these parametrizations are highly valuable , the main merit being their easy and flexible use and rapid evaluation . at the same time , an unbiased evaluation of their accuracy had not been done and appears highly important , as this allows to constrain the field of applicability of these models and to indicate directions for future improvements .    summarizing our findings",
    ", we have observed that the semi - analytic parametrization by ebeling @xcite is mostly reliable in the high- and zero temperature limits , but exhibits substantial deviations in between .",
    "the stls - fit given by ichimaru an co - workers @xcite , on the other hand , exhibits a surprisingly high accuracy for all investigated @xmath17-@xmath28-combinations with a typical relative systematic error of @xmath76 .",
    "the more recent vashishta - singwi ( vs ) results @xcite that automatically fulfill the compressibility sum - rule display a qualitatively similar behavior but are significantly less accurate everywhere .",
    "the classical mapping suggested by perrot and dharma - wardana @xcite constitutes an approximation rather with respect to temperature than to coupling strength and , consequently , exhibits different trends .",
    "in particular , we have found that the relative systematic error is nearly independent of @xmath17 , but decreases with increasing @xmath28 and eventually vanishes for @xmath32 .",
    "overall , the accuracy of the pdw - parametrization is comparable to vs and , hence , inferior to stls . finally , the more recent fit by karasiev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to rpimc data @xcite is accurate for large @xmath17 and low temperature , where the input data is not too biased by the inappropriate treatment of finite - size errors in the underlying rpimc results . for higher temperatures ( where the exchange correlation free energy constitutes only a small fraction of the total free energy )",
    "there occur relative deviations of up to @xmath77 .",
    "thus we conclude that an accurate parametrization of the exchange - correlation free energy that is valid for all @xmath17-@xmath28-combinations is presently not available . however , the recent qmc data by dornheim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite most certainly constitute a promising basis for the construction of such a functional .",
    "further , thermal dft calculations in the local spin - density approximation require a parametrization of @xmath10 also as a function of the spin - polarization @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 for all warm dense matter parameters .",
    "obviously , this will require to extend the qmc simulations beyond the unpolarized case , @xmath80 $ ] and , in addition , reliable data for @xmath81 are indispensable .",
    "this work is presently under way .",
    "we also note that the quality of the currently available ksdt fit for @xmath79 remains to be tested for @xmath82 .",
    "the accuracy of this parametrization is limited by ( i ) the quality of the rpimc data ( for the spin - polarized ueg ( @xmath83 ) they are afflicted with a substantially larger nodal error than for the unpolarized case that we considered in the present paper , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and ( ii ) by the quality of the pdw - results @xcite that have been included as the only input to the ksdt - fit for @xmath84 at finite @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the construction of a new , accurate function @xmath79 is still of high importance for thermal dft and semi - analytical models , for comparisons with experiments , but also for explicitly time - dependent approaches such as time - dependent dft and quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
