    "genius ( germanium in liquid nitrogen underground setup ) is a proposal for operating a large amount of naked ge detectors in liquid nitrogen to search for rare events such as wimp - nucleus scattering , neutrinoless double beta decay and solar neutrino interactions , with a much increased sensitivity relative to existing experiments @xcite . by removing ( almost ) all materials from the immediate vicinity of the ge - crystals ,",
    "their absolute background can be considerably decreased with respect to conventionally operated detectors .",
    "the liquid nitrogen acts both as a cooling medium and as a shield against external radioactivity .",
    "the proposed scale of the experiment is a nitrogen tank of about 12 m diameter and 12 m height with 100 kg of natural ge and 1 ton of enriched @xmath0ge in the dark matter and double beta decay versions , respectively , suspended in its center .    to cover large parts of the mssm parameter space , relevant for the detection of neutralinos as dark matter candidates @xcite",
    ", a maximum background level of 10@xmath1 counts/(kgykev ) in the energy region below 100kev has to be achieved . in the double beta decay region ( q - value = 2038.56kev ) a background of 0.3  events/(tykev ) is needed in order to test the effective majorana neutrino mass down to 0.01ev .",
    "this implies a very large background reduction in comparison to our recent best results @xcite with the heidelberg ",
    "moscow experiment .",
    "to demonstrate the feasibility of operating ge detectors in liquid nitrogen we performed three experiments in the heidelberg low level laboratory @xcite .",
    "the goal was to look for possible interferences between two or more naked ge crystals , to test different cable lengths between fets and crystals and to design and test preliminary holder systems . for crystal masses between 300400 g we achieved energy resolutions of about 1.0kev at 300kev and thresholds of about 2kev .",
    "no microphonic events due to nitrogen boiling beyond 2kev could be detected .",
    "also , we could nt observe any cross talk using only p  type detectors ( same polarity for the hv - bias ) , since cross talk signals have the wrong polarity and are filtered by the amplifier .",
    "concluding , the performance of the ge detectors is as good ( or even better ) as for conventionally operated crystals , even with 6 m cable lengths between crystal and fet .",
    "for an estimation of the expected overall background in both low and high energy regions , we performed detailed monte carlo simulations of all the relevant background sources .",
    "the sources of background can be divided into external and internal ones .",
    "external background is generated by events originating from outside the liquid shield , such as photons and neutrons from the gran sasso rock , muon interactions and muon induced activities .",
    "internal background arises from residual impurities in the liquid nitrogen , in the steel vessel , in the crystal holder system , in the ge crystals themselves and from activation of both liquid nitrogen and ge crystals at the earths surface . for the simulation of muon showers ,",
    "the external photon flux and the radioactive decay chains we used the geant3.21 package @xcite extended for nuclear decays @xcite .    the simulated geometry consisted of a cylindrical nitrogen vessel of 12 m in diameter and 12 m in height , surrounded by a 2 m thick polyethylene - foam isolation , which is held by two 2 mm thick steel layers .",
    "the crystals were held by a holder system of high molecular polyethylene and positioned in the tank centre .",
    "we simulated the measured photon @xcite , neutron @xcite and muon @xcite fluxes in the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "the underlying assumptions were a 12m@xmath212 m nitrogen shield , a 2 m thick boron loaded polyethylene foam isolation and a muon veto with a 96% efficiency on top of the tank @xcite .",
    "the resulting count rates for both low and high energy regions are shown in table [ sim_1 ] .    .resulting count rates for the simulation of the gamma , neutron and muon fluxes measured in the gran sasso laboratory , in the energy regions between 11kev100kev and 2000kev - 2080kev .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ cosmo - n ]    no events of tritium decay were detected in the ge - crystals , mainly due to the absorption in the dead layer of the p - type ge detectors .",
    "for @xmath3be , the additional assumption of one year of deactivation in gran sasso was made .",
    "moreover , it can be expected , that a large fraction of @xmath4be is removed from the liquid nitrogen at the cleaning process for rn . for the production of @xmath5be and @xmath6c",
    "both neutron and muon capture induced channels were considered .",
    "summing up the background contributions discussed so far , the mean count rate in the low energy region amounts to about 6@xmath210@xmath1 events/(kgykev ) and to 2.8@xmath210@xmath7 events/(tykev ) in the region relevant for the 0@xmath8-decay .    in fig .",
    "[ specall ] the spectra of individual contributions and the summed up total background spectrum are shown ( after three years of storage of the ge detectors below ground ) .",
    "the low energy spectrum is dominated by events originating from the cosmogenic activation of the ge crystals at the earths surface .",
    "another two years of storage below ground , or production of the detectors in an underground facility would significantly reduce this contribution .",
    "for the high - energy region , the results of the simulations are comparable to the aim of 0.3counts/(tykev ) .",
    "the background spectrum is dominated by the contribution of external gammas ( which again reveals the importance of a 12m@xmath9 lin shield ) followed by the contribution of the cosmogenic @xmath10co .",
    "with 100 kg of natural ge and a background of 1@xmath210@xmath1 events/(kgykev ) in the energy region between 11100kev , genius could test a large part of the predicted mssm parameter space for neutralinos as dark matter candidates .",
    "figure [ limits ] shows a comparison of existing constraints and future sensitivities of cold dark matter experiments , together with the theoretical expectations for neutralino scattering rates @xcite .",
    "even if the background would be higher than expected , genius could easily cover the range of positive evidence for dark matter claimed by the dama experiment @xcite .",
    "it would be an independent test by using a different technology and only raw data , without any background subtraction .",
    "moreover , genius would be the only experiment which could test dama directly , having a realistic chance to see the predicted seasonal variation of the event rate in 100 kg of detector material .",
    "evidence region of the dama experiment @xcite .",
    "the experimental limits are compared to expectations ( scatter plot ) for wimp - neutralinos calculated in the mssm parameter space at the weak scale ( without any gut constraints ) under the assumption that all superpartner masses are lower than 300 gev - 400 gev @xcite . ]    [ limits ]      neutrinoless double beta decay provides a powerful method for gaining informations about the absolute neutrino mass scale and a unique method of discerning between a majorana and a dirac neutrino .",
    "the current most stringent experimental limit on the effective majorana neutrino mass , @xmath110.36 ev , comes from the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite . for a significant step beyond this limit , much higher source strengths and lower",
    "background levels are needed .",
    "this goal could be accomplished by the genius experiment operating 300400 detectors made of enriched @xmath0ge ( 1 ton ) . with a background rate of 0.3events/(tykev ) in the energy region between 20002080kev , genius would reach the sensitivity of @xmath11 0.01ev after oneyear of measuring time .",
    "this would have striking influence on presently discussed neutrino mass scenarios @xcite and would allow a breakthrough into the multi tev range for many beyond standard models @xcite .",
    "already now the result from the heidelberg - moscow experiment excludes simultaneous solutions for hot dark matter , the atmospheric neutrino problem and the small mixing angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem @xcite , as well as one of the two solutions for four - neutrino scenarios @xcite .",
    "genius would determine the mixing in partially or completely degenerate neutrino mass schemes with extreme accuracy , providing informations being complementary to precision tests of cosmological parameters by map and planck @xcite .",
    "besides that , it could test the lsnd indication for neutrino oscillations . for a detailed discussion of these topics we refer to @xcite .",
    "moreover , genius would yield information on supersymmetry ( r - parity breaking , sneutrino mass ) , leptoquarks ( leptoquark -higgs coupling or leptoquark mass ) , compositeness , right - handed w boson mass , test of special relativity and equivalence principle in the neutrino sector , neutrino magnetic moment and others , competitive to corresponding results from future high - energy colliders @xcite .      the very low background aimed at by genius in the low energy region , its energy threshold of about 11kev and a target mass of at least 1 ton of natural ( or enriched )",
    "ge would open the possibility to look for pp- and @xmath3be solar neutrino interactions in real - time . the detection reaction would be the elastic scattering process @xmath12 + e@xmath13 @xmath12 + e@xmath14 .",
    "the maximum electron recoil energy is 261kev for the pp - neutrinos and 665 kev for the @xmath4be - neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the dominant part of the signal in genius would be produced by pp - neutrinos ( 66% ) and the @xmath4be - neutrinos ( 33% ) @xcite .",
    "a target mass of 1 ton ( 10 tons ) of natural or enriched ge corresponds to about 3@xmath210@xmath15 ( 3@xmath210@xmath16 ) electrons . using the cross section for elastic neutrino - electron scattering from @xcite and the neutrino fluxes from @xcite ,",
    "the expected number of events in the standard solar model ( bp98 @xcite ) can be estimated : + r@xmath17 = 68.9 snu = 1.8 events / day ( 18 events / day for 10 tons ) + r@xmath18 = 28.5 snu = 0.6 events / day ( 6 events / day for 10 tons ) , + the event rates for full @xmath19 conversion are 0.48 events / day for pp - neutrinos and 0.14 events / day for @xmath4be - neutrinos for 1 ton of ge and ten times higher for 10 tons .    in order for genius to be sensitive to the low - energy solar neutrino flux , the background requirements would be more stringent than for the dark matter version .",
    "a nitrogen shield of 13 m in diameter and 13 m in height is required . regarding the radiopurity of liquid nitrogen , the values reached at present by the borexino collaboration for their liquid scintillator would be sufficient .",
    "more attention has to be paid to the cosmogenic activation of the ge crystals at the earth surface . in case of one day exposure",
    ", fiveyears of deactivation below ground are required .",
    "the optimal solution would be to produce the detectors in an underground facility .    if the signal to background ratio ( s / b ) in genius will be greater than 1 , than the pp- and @xmath4be - neutrino flux can be measured by spectroscopic techniques alone . if s / b @xmath20 1 , one can make use of a solar signature in order to derive the flux .",
    "the eccentricity of the earths orbit induces a seasonal variation of about 7% from maximum to minimum .",
    "even if the number of background events is not known , the background event rate and the signal event rate can be extracted independently by fitting the event rate to the seasonal variation .",
    "the only assumption is that the background is stable in time and that enough statistics is available . in case of a day / night - variation of the solar neutrino flux",
    ", genius would be sensitive to the low msw solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the capability of the genius project to search for rare events such as wimp - nucleus scattering , neutrinoless double beta decay and low energy solar neutrino interactions has been reviewed . after presenting experimental studies which confirm the good performance of naked ge - crystals in liquid nitrogen ,",
    "the background requirements were discussed in some detail .",
    "the results achieved by monte carlo simulations for both low and high energy regions are promising .    reaching the background level aimed at , the genius project could bring a large progress in the field of direct dark matter detection .",
    "it could probe a relevant part of the susy ",
    "wimp parameter space interesting for the detection of neutralinos , thus possibly deciding whether or not neutralinos are the major component of the dark matter in our galaxy . in its double beta decay version ,",
    "genius could deliver important insights on the absolute neutrino mass scale , probing the effective majorana neutrino mass down to 0.01 ev .",
    "last but not least , it could be the first detector to detect the solar pp neutrinos in real - time .",
