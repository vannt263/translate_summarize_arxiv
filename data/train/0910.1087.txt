    "given the importance of conformal invariance , the situation is rather embarrassing .",
    "it is also in contradiction to gell - mann s  everything which is not forbidden , is compulsory . \"    as our title shows , we would like to reopen the discussion of this interesting problem . the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sec:2pt ]",
    "we revisit the proof in @xmath0 .",
    "very little dynamical information is used in this well - known proof .",
    "it is enough to study the 2-point function of the symmetric stress tensor @xmath10 , which is fixed by lorentz and scale invariance up to a few numerical coefficients .",
    "the stress tensor conservation provides a strong constraint on these coefficients , to the extent that a particular linear combination which enters the 2-point function of the trace @xmath11 is constrained to be zero .",
    "it is at this point that the unitarity is invoked to conclude that @xmath12 , and thus the theory is conformally invariant .",
    "we then discuss why this @xmath0 proof does not generalize to higher dimensions .",
    "the conclusions of section 2 is that if a proof in @xmath9 exists , it must be based on ideas essentially different from @xmath0 .",
    "we speculate that perhaps the stress tensor ward identities may turn out useful .",
    "having failed to find a proof , we proceed to look for counterexamples . for any @xmath13 ,",
    "the scale current of the theory is related to @xmath10 via @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a local operator without explicit dependence on the coordinates . in a scale invariant theory",
    "the current ( [ scalecurrent ] ) is conserved , which means : @xmath16 now , if @xmath17 has the special form@xmath18 where @xmath19 is another local field , then a conserved conformal current can be constructed . at the same time",
    ", one can construct an ` improved ' symmetric stress tensor @xmath20 which is traceless:@xmath21 @xmath20 is obtained from @xmath10 by adding a local operator which is a total divergence and identically conserved:@xmath22 here @xmath23 is antisymmetric in @xmath24 and @xmath25 and symmetric under @xmath26 ; such an operator can be constructed in terms of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath27 is physically equivalent to @xmath10 , and the condition ( [ eq : theta ] )  makes conformal symmetry manifest .",
    "as stressed by polchinski @xcite , this analysis narrows significantly the circle of possible counterexamples .",
    "namely , a theory must have nontrivial candidates for a dimension 3 vector operator @xmath17 which is a ) not conserved and b ) is not of the form ( [ eq : kl ] ) .",
    "several better - known perturbative fixed points , such as the belavin - migdal - banks - zaks fixed points for non - abelian gauge theories coupled to fermions in @xmath28 @xcite , or the wilson - fisher @xmath29 fixed point in @xmath30 @xcite do not contain such a candidate , and thus are automatically conformally invariant .    the simplest class of theories with @xmath17 candidates are the multi - field generalizations of @xmath29:@xmath31 the @xmath17 could be given by @xmath32}\\,s_{i}\\partial_{\\mu}s_{j}\\ , , \\label{eq : kmu}\\ ] ] where @xmath33}$ ] is a real antisymmetric matrix .",
    "these theories can have perturbative fixed points in @xmath30 .",
    "the usual fixed points , obtained by setting the one - loop @xmath34-functions to zero , have @xmath12 and are conformally invariant .",
    "one could hope that more general fixed points of the type ( [ eq : tk ] ) exist .",
    "however , this turns out not to be the case @xcite .",
    "namely , one can show that if ( [ eq : tk ] ) holds , then necessarily @xmath35 , and we are back to the usual case .    to our knowledge , this was the first and the last systematic attempt to look for counterexamples , and it did not succeed .",
    "we do nt really know why : the only known proof is by inspection . nor do we know what happens in higher orders of perturbation theory . in our opinion , it is important to continue the search .",
    "clearly , ( [ eq : phi4 ] ) is not the most general unitary field theory which can have fixed points in @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in section [ sec : count ] we consider a more general model which contains an arbitrary number of scalars and weyl fermions , with quartic and yukawa interactions .",
    "the full lagrangian consists of ( [ eq : phi4 ] ) and of@xmath36 we thus allow both for possible parity and cp breaking .",
    "it s not clear if these discrete symmetries have anything to do with the relation between scale and conformal invariance , but we would like to explore without prejudice .",
    "we then look for one - loop fixed points with scale but without conformal invariance .",
    "once again , it turns out that there are none .",
    "the proof of this fact is however more involved than in the case without fermions .",
    "we find a way to represent it graphically : contractions of the @xmath34-function feynman graphs with graphs representing @xmath17 candidates all vanish by ( anti)symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , this is still a proof by inspection : we do nt explain _ why _ all contracted graphs had the needed symmetry properties .",
    "this is a problem for the future .    in all of the above discussion",
    "we were assuming , for good reasons indeed , that a stress tensor exists .",
    "if one drops this physical requirement , there are theories which are unitary and scale invariant but not conformal .",
    "we mention a couple of such _ fake _ counterexamples in section [ sec : count ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ concl ] with comments about the possible impact of the eventual resolution of this problem on the tev - scale phenomenology .",
    "zamolodchikov had an idea to take the stress tensor 2-point function , impose conservation , and see what comes out of it .",

    "one of several equivalent stress tensors considered in that paper , eq .",
    "( 14 ) , does not scale canonically , and its trace 2-point function is nonzero . however , an appropriate improvement exists which restores the canonical scaling , and leads to the vanishing 2-point function of the trace .",
    "[ the last step of the proof , concluding that @xmath57 , can not be carried out since the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is not reflection - positive . ]",
    "let us come back to the implicit assumption 1 ) .",
    "hull and townsend @xcite have shown that scale - invariant but not conformally - invariant unitary theories exist among 2d sigma - models with non - compact target space .",
    "these models likely violate assumption 1 ) , and perhaps also 2 ) @xcite .      in appendix a , we repeat the @xmath0 argument in higher dimensions and see that it does not go through . in other words , in @xmath9",
    "it is impossible to conclude from scaling , conservation , and unitarity alone that the stress tensor is traceless .",
    "in fact , we can understand this by an explicit example .",
    "consider the free massless scalar theory .",
    "its non - improved stress tensor,@xmath65 is conserved , the 2-point function is unitary , and does not contain logarithms . yet @xmath66 is not vanishing for @xmath9 .",
    "of course we know that in this case an improved traceless tensor exists .",
    "but if you are given a random stress tensor you can not expect to be able to prove that it s traceless .",
    "what this means is that in @xmath9 we should start from ( [ eq : tk ] ) and aim for proving ( [ eq : kl ] ) .",
    "this is weaker than tracelessness , but is enough to show that the theory is conformal .",
    "why is there such a difference between @xmath9 and @xmath0 ?",
    "one explanation is as follows . in @xmath0 , among all the equivalent stress tensors , only one will have the 2-point function which scales canonically , without logarithms .",
    "this is because @xmath23 is dimensionless in 2d , and its 2-point function is logarithmic .",
    "then , it turns out that this very special canonically - scaling @xmath10 is traceless . in @xmath9",
    "the situation is different , since @xmath23 has positive mass dimension .",
    "thus the transformation ( [ eq : emmodif ] ) does not have to introduce logarithms .",
    "at present , one can only hypothesize on how ( [ eq : kl ] ) could be derived .",
    "for example , one could start with correlators containing one @xmath10 insertion and some other fields of the theory .",
    "these correlators are constrained via ward identities .",
    "another constraint is provided by ( [ eq : tk ] ) .",
    "now , perhaps one could show that correlators of @xmath17 satisfy an integrability condition which allows to define a local field @xmath19 , consistently with ( [ eq : kl ] ) .",
    "then one would have to extend the definition of @xmath19 to correlators with two stress tensor insertions etc .",
    "this is not an easy plan to carry out . also , we know that unitarity must enter the scene , and it is not clear how this will happen .",
    "it makes sense to attack the problem from both sides .",
    "if the theorem is not true , a counterexample must exist . in this section",
    "we will discuss what is known in this direction .",
    "we will explain that one should restrict attention to theories which have stress tensor .",
    "actually , if this physical requirement is dropped , the problem trivializes and simple counterexamples exist .",
    "we will also rule out the presence of counterexamples within a new large class of models in @xmath1 dimensions .      first a general remark about theories which _ should not _ be considered as counterexamples .",
    "we are referring to field theories which , while being unitary and scale invariant , do not have a stress tensor . as is well known , wightman axioms require existence of the full energy and momentum , but not of their density , which is the stress tensor",
    ". however , it seems reasonable to adopt existence of a stress tensor as an additional axiom that a full - fledged field theory must satisfy .",
    "otherwise we would not know how to couple the theory to ( classical ) gravity .",
    "consider a theory which contains a vector field @xmath67 of scaling dimension @xmath68 , whose 2-point function is given by:@xmath69 we assume that the theory is free ( gaussian ) . in practice",
    "this means that all higher - order correlators are computed from ( [ eq : aa ] ) via wick s theorem .",
    "composite fields can be defined via ope .",
    "in essence , this defines a field theory , which is unitary if and only if the two - point function ( [ eq : aa ] ) is unitary .",
    "one can analyze the unitarity of ( [ eq : aa ] )  by the same method we used to study the stress tensor 2-point function in appendix a , see also @xcite .",
    "the answer is that it is unitary if and only if@xmath70    now , let us analyze when the theory based on ( [ eq : aa ] ) is conformal .",

    "this means that the real antisymmetric @xmath111 and antihermitean @xmath96 are contracted with hermitean matrices .",
    "such contractions are pure imaginary , and do not contribute to the manifestly real lhs of ( [ eq : pp ] ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath119 , and thus @xmath104 .",
    "let us proceed with @xmath87 .",
    "from the first eq .",
    "( [ eq : bqbp ] ) we have:@xmath120 purely scalar terms in the rhs were already shown above to vanish identically .",
    "the terms involving fermion loops are:@xmath121{lq3.eps}}\\qquad{\\includegraphics [ height=0.8373 in , width=1.0821 in ] { lq4.eps}}\\qquad{\\includegraphics [ height=0.8373 in , width=1.0661 in ] { lq5.eps}}\\,.\\ ] ] the first graph is symmetric and vanishes for the usual reason .",
    "the other two do not exhibit any obvious symmetry .",
    "however , let us invoke the already shown property @xmath104 .",
    "graphically:@xmath122{p1.eps}}=-\\left ( \\raisebox{-0.3087in}{\\includegraphics [ height=0.738 in , width=0.9908 in ] { p2.eps}}+\\text{perm}\\right )   \\,.\\ ] ] using this identity , the two non - symmetric graphs are transformed into:@xmath123{lq4a.eps}}\\qquad{\\includegraphics [ height=0.7344 in , width=0.5898 in ] { lq5a.eps}},\\ ] ] which _ are _ symmetric and vanish .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "in this paper we gave a fresh look at the relation of scale and conformal invariance in unitary field theories in @xmath124 as we discussed at length , the situation is frustrating : we do nt know if one implies the other , although this holds in all known examples .",
    "we added to the list a new large class of models : multi - field theories of massless scalars and weyl fermions with arbitrary quartic and yukawa interactions .",
    "what makes these models interesting is that they contain nontrivial candidates for a non - conserved dimension 3 vector which could in principle appear as a correction term in the scale current , thus making a scale - invariant theory non - conformal .",
    "however , we showed that this never happens for the one - loop fixed points in @xmath125 dimensions .",
    "our current proof proceeds by inspecting symmetry properties of certain feynman graphs .",
    "we suspect that a deeper explanation must exist and hope that it may one day be found .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to point out that if scale - invariant but non - conformal unitary theories exist , this may have not only theoretical but also phenomenological consequences :    1 .   in the unparticle physics scenario",
    "@xcite one assumes the existence of a scale - invariant hidden sector weakly coupled to the standard model via non - renormalizable operators . to study phenomenology of such a scenario",
    ", one would like to know if dimensions and propagators of vector operators in the hidden sector must follow the rules of conformal theories , or can be more general @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the conformal technicolor scenario of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , one assumes that the higgs field @xmath64 belongs to a strongly interacting sector with conformal invariance above a tev .",
    "furthermore , one assumes an unusual pattern of operator dimensions : @xmath64 should have dimension close to @xmath126 ( to avoid problems with flavor ) , while the composite operator @xmath127 must have dimension close to @xmath128 ( to solve the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "it is not known if such large deviation from the naive relation @xmath129\\simeq2[h]$ ] can be realized in a conformal field theory .",
    "in fact , recent work @xcite uses conformal symmetry to show that there is least one scalar in the ope @xmath130 whose dimension is close to @xmath131 if @xmath132\\simeq1 $ ] .",
    "while it is not yet known if this scalar is a singlet @xmath127 or a triplet @xmath133 , one can well imagine that future studies may rule out conformal technicolor . in this case",
    "it would be interesting to know if the scenario could be saved by assuming that the higgs sector is scale - invariant but not conformal , in which case the bounds of @xcite  do not apply .",
    "we are grateful to jan troost for useful discussions and comments .",
    "this work was partially supported by the eu under rtn contract mrtn - ct-2004 - 503369 and by miur under the contract prin-2006022501 .",
    "in this section , we will explore how conservation and unitarity constrain the stress tensor 2-point function in @xmath9 . as explained in section [ sec : extra ] , we can not expect to derive tracelessness .",
    "it is instructive to see where exactly the @xmath0 argument breaks down .",

    "( [ eq : tt ] ) , different from the other terms .",
    "that s why it dropped out from the conservation constraint and contributed only a local term to the 2-point function of the trace .",
    "in retrospect , this was essentially due to an accident , that in 2d the number of indices of @xmath10 becomes equal to its scaling dimension , which led to the appearance of the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttx ] ) .",
    "this does not happen in @xmath9 , where all 5 terms in ( [ eq:4dx ] ) are on equal footing .",
    "thus , we can already foresee that conservation will not be as constraining .",
    "let us now see which further constraints on @xmath140 come out by imposing unitarity .",
    "the unitarity constraint is obtained by considering the non time - ordered 2-point function in minkowski space .",
    "the spectral density is given by the imaginary part of the schwinger function in fourier space ( [ eq:4dk ] ) , and is concentrated in the forward lightcone @xmath141 , @xmath142 . in a unitary theory , the tensorial spectral density must be positive definite , i.e.  for any fixed tensor @xmath143 the operator @xmath144 must have positive spectral density .    an important partial case is @xmath145 , which corresponds to studying the 2-point function of the trace . from ( [ eq:4dk ] ) , ( [ eq : constraint ] )",
    ", we have@xmath146\\,f_{d}(k^{2})\\ , , \\label{eq:2pttr}\\ ] ] where we expressed all @xmath140 in terms of @xmath147 . thus @xmath148    passing to general @xmath143 , by lorentz invariance it is enough to examine the spectral density for @xmath149 . multiplying ( [ eq:4dk ] ) with a symmetric @xmath150 and its conjugate , and extracting the imaginary part",
    ", we get the following constraint on the coefficients:@xmath151 separating the spatial and temporal coordinates , this condition can be rewritten as:@xmath152 the first three terms drop out thanks to the conservation constraints ( [ eq : constraint ] ) , and we are left with@xmath153 the necessary and sufficient conditions for this to be true are derived by considering separately off - diagonal and diagonal @xmath154 .",
    "we obtain:@xmath155 this is not much extra mileage compared to the partial case ( [ eq : trun ] ) components in @xmath9 and states that the trace 2-point function gives the strongest condition .",
