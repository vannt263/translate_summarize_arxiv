    "since @xmath103 and @xmath104 of ptf ( @xmath110 ) are very close to the values of stf , the small differences in @xmath70 between stf and ptf ( @xmath110 ) should be caused by the different treatment of nucleon distributions between these two methods . in the last column of table  [ tab:2 ] , we compare the cell radius @xmath28 obtained by different methods .",

    "there is almost no proton gas ( @xmath130 ) , while the neutron gas fraction @xmath125 is very small and decreases with increasing density .",
    "this implies that nucleons inside the droplet are dominant at low temperature . for the case of @xmath111 mev and @xmath85 ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "more nucleons can drip out of the nuclei as shown in figures  [ fig:4dt10 ] , and as a result @xmath125 is of the same order of @xmath124 , while @xmath126 is about one order lower than @xmath125 . comparing the results between stf and ptf , it is hard to see any significant difference at @xmath111 mev ( bottom panel ) , while there is a small difference in @xmath125 at @xmath87 mev ( top panel ) .    in figures  [ fig:8mup ] and  [ fig:9mun ] , we show the chemical potentials of protons and neutrons , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , as a function of @xmath2 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev",
    ". the results of ptf are taken from eos2 of  @xcite , which were calculated through the thermodynamic relations given in equations  ( a16 ) and ( a17 ) of  @xcite . in the stf approximation ,",
    "the chemical potentials given in equations  ( [ eq : mup ] ) and  ( [ eq : mun ] ) are obtained self - consistently as described in section  [ sec:2 ] , which are spatially constant throughout the wigner  seitz cell .",
    "it is shown that the appearance of the bubble phase at @xmath90 causes sudden jumps in @xmath117 and @xmath118 within the stf approximation .",
    "this is mainly because the coulomb potential in the bubble is very different from that in the droplet . as for comparison between stf and ptf",
    ", it is found that there are visible differences between stf and ptf in @xmath117 as shown in figure  [ fig:8mup ] , while the chemical potentials of neutrons are almost identical between stf and ptf with the same droplet configuration as shown in figure  [ fig:9mun ] .",
    "the difference in @xmath117 may be related to the difference in coulomb interaction between stf and ptf .",
    "as discussed above , the coulomb and surface energies in ptf with @xmath60 is relatively small compared to those of stf , which means that the coulomb potential in ptf should be smaller than that in stf . according to equation  ( [ eq : mup ] )",
    ", a larger coulomb potential corresponds to a higher @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we obtain higher @xmath117 in stf due to its larger coulomb potential . on the other hand , @xmath118 is not directly related to the coulomb potential , so the difference in @xmath118 between stf and ptf is very small as shown in figure  [ fig:9mun ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the non - uniform matter at subnuclear densities using the stf approximation . for the effective nuclear interaction ,",
    "we have adopted the rmf theory including nonlinear @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms with the parameter set tm1 which can reproduce good saturation properties of nuclear matter and satisfactory description of finite nuclei .",
    "we have made a detailed comparison between the stf approximation used in this study and the ptf approximation adopted in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have included the bubble phase that could be present before the transition to uniform matter .",
    "it has been found that the inclusion of the bubble phase can significantly affect the chemical potentials of protons and neutrons , while its effects on free energy and entropy are relatively small .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of the bubble phase can delay the transition to uniform matter .",
    "we have examined the difference between stf and ptf . in the stf method ,",
    "the nucleon distribution and the surface effect are treated self - consistently .",
    "we have minimized the free energy with respect to the cell radius at given temperature @xmath0 , proton fraction @xmath1 , and baryon mass density @xmath2 .",
    "the thermodynamically favored state is the one with the lowest free energy among all configurations considered .",
    "the results obtained in the stf approximation have been compared with those of ptf .",
    "it have been found that there is no obvious difference in nucleon distributions at lower densities , while the difference becomes noticeable near the transition density to uniform matter . for thermodynamical quantities , such as the free energy and entropy per baryon",
    ", the results of both methods generally agree well with each other . however , there are some small differences between stf and ptf which need to be analyzed .",
    "the free energy per baryon obtained in ptf is slightly lower than that of stf for the same droplet configuration .",
    "this is mainly caused by the inconsistent treatment of the surface effect in ptf , namely the surface and coulomb energies with the parameter @xmath60 is relatively small compared to those obtained self - consistently in stf . in addition , the smaller surface energy in ptf leads to a smaller cell radius in comparison to that of stf . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton chemical potential obtained in stf is slightly higher than that of ptf , which is also related to the difference in the coulomb and surface energies between stf and ptf .",
    "therefore , we can draw the conclusion that most of the differences between stf and ptf should be due to the different treatment of surface effect , namely the parameter @xmath64 used in ptf is not large enough in comparison with the results obtained in the stf approximation .    considering the wide range of thermodynamic conditions in the whole eos  @xcite ,",
    "the differences between stf and ptf are thought to be negligible and can not affect the general behavior of the eos .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ptf approximation is a reasonable description for non - uniform matter , and can produce very similar eos with that obtained in the stf approximation which is considered to be self - consistent in the treatment of surface effect and nucleon distribution .",
