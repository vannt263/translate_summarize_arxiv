    "in this work we shall investigate and compare some effective preconditioning solvers for the following saddle - point system : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is nonsingular , so @xmath7 must be of full row rank .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case where @xmath8 is symmetric semi - positive definite , and dim@xmath9 , that is , @xmath8 is maximally rank deficient @xcite @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 is assumed to be symmetric positive definite , and @xmath11 is a given real number .",
    "the saddle - point system of form with a maximal rank deficient @xmath8 arises from many applications , including the numerical solution of time - harmonic maxwell s equations @xcite where @xmath11 represents the wave number , the underdetermined norm - minimization problems and geophysical inverse problems ; see more details in the recent paper @xcite that was a very inspiring and innovative work and developed a class of indefinite block preconditioners for the use with the cg method , and cg may converge rapidly under certain conditions when it is applied for solving the general saddle - point system of form with a maximal rank deficient @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that the saddle - point system under the above particular setting has not received as much attention as other situations , for example , the case of a symmetric positive definite @xmath8 .",
    "but as it was demonstrated in @xcite for the special case @xmath12 , when @xmath8 is maximally rank deficient , some nice mathematical structures may be revealed and adopted to help construct efficient solution methods .",
    "this work is initiated and motivated by @xcite and will develop further in this direction , and show that new efficient numerical methods can be equally constructed for more general and difficult case @xmath13 .",
    "though most results of this work apply also to the general saddle - point system of form with a maximal rank deficient @xmath8 as it was done in @xcite for the case @xmath12 , we shall mainly focus on the saddle - point system that arises from the edge element discretization of the following time - harmonic maxwell equations in vacuum @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a vector field , @xmath16 is the scalar multiplier , and @xmath17 is the given external source .",
    "@xmath18 is a simply connected domain in @xmath19 with a connected boundary @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being its outward unit normal .",
    "the wave number  @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive frequency , permittivity and permeability of the medium , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is not an interior maxwell eigenvalue , and know the cases with appropriately small and large frequencies are physically relevant in magnetostatics , wave propagation and other applications @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey on this topic .",
    "the introduction of the lagrange multiplier @xmath16 in may not be absolutely necessary for the general case @xmath13 , for which the divergence constraint does not need to be enforced explicitly ; namely it is possible to solve directly for @xmath15 using the first equation in with @xmath28 mathematically @xcite , although it is still challenging to design an efficient numerical solver for this indefinite system .",
    "the saddle - point formulation with the lagrange multiplier @xmath16 is stable and well - posed @xcite , especially it ensures the stability and gauss s law when @xmath11 is small and may better handle the singularity of the solution at the boundary of the domain @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the mixed form provides some extra flexibility on the computational aspect @xcite and leads to better numerical stability and more efficient numerical solvers than the single system without lagrange multiplier ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) , as it was shown in @xcite @xcite . and",
    "this is also the main motivation and focus and of the current work .",
    "after discretizing by using the ndlec elements of the first kind @xcite for the approximation of the vector field @xmath15 and the standard nodal elements for the multiplier @xmath16 , we derive the saddle - point system of our interest .",
    "we assume that the coefficient matrix @xmath29 in and its leading block @xmath30 are both nonsingular , which is true when the mesh size is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "some very efficient preconditioners were proposed and analyzed recently in @xcite for the special case of the saddle - point system , i.e. , the wave number @xmath12 , and reduces to @xmath31 the following preconditioner @xmath32 was proposed in @xcite for solving the saddle - point system  : @xmath33 where the matrix @xmath34 is the discrete laplacian , while @xmath35 is a sparse matrix , whose columns span @xmath36 and can be formed easily using the gradients of the standard nodal bases @xcite .",
    "it was proved that the preconditioned system @xmath37 is simply diagonal , given by @xmath38 as both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are symmetric positive definite , it allows us to apply a cg - like method for the preconditioned system @xmath41 in a non - stardand inner product , even both @xmath42 and @xmath32 are indefinite . for the more general case @xmath13 , the block tridiagonal preconditioners @xmath43 with double variable relaxation parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 were studied in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we construct some new preconditioners for and respectively .",
    "we will first show that for the case with vanishing wave number ( @xmath12 ) , instead of the aforementioned efficient solver by using the preconditioner or ( with @xmath12 ) , we can directly make use of the solution of the singular curl - curl system to construct a more direct and efficient solver .    as it was shown in @xcite that preconditioners @xmath46 in work very effectively for the special and simple case with vanishing wave number ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we shall demonstrate that similar preconditioners can be constructed also for the saddle - point linear system with more general and difficult cases , i.e. , @xmath47 , including high frequency waves .",
    "and we will see analytically the spectral distributions of these new preconditioners are quite similar to the ones of the existing effective preconditioners .",
    "but the new preconditioner can be applied with cg iteration under a non - standard inner product although both the coefficient matrix @xmath6 and the new preconditioner are indefinite for @xmath13 , and numerically they will perform mostly better and more stable than the existing preconditioners .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we shall develop in section  [ inverse ] an important formula for computing the inverse of @xmath29 , based on which we propose in subsection  [ sec.31 ] some more direct and efficient solver for the saddle - point system with vanishing wave number .",
    "then we shall propose a new preconditioner and compare its performance with existing preconditioners for the saddle - point system   with general wave numbers , and study and compare the spectral properties of the preconditioned matrices in subsection  [ preconditioners ] .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section  [ numerical ] .",

    "we still write @xmath96 , and follow the earlier proof of the non - singularity of the matrix , but with @xmath94 now",
