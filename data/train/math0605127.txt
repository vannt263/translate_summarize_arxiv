    "the _ morse index _ @xmath0 of a constant mean curvature ( cmc ) closed ( compact without boundary ) surface @xmath1 is a measure of @xmath1 s degree of instability with respect to area , in this sense : we define @xmath0 as the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath1 s jacobi operator @xmath2 , where the function space is the @xmath3 functions from @xmath1 to the reals @xmath4 .",
    "this is one of two different definitions used in the literature , the other being the _ weak index _ , equal to the maximal dimension of a vector space of functions given by first derivatives of volume - preserving variations , all of whose nonzero members come from variations that reduce area . @xmath0",

    "various combinations of the two indices are possible : in the euclidean @xmath6-space @xmath7 , planes have both indices zero , spheres are stable with morse index one , and catenoids and enneper surfaces have both indices one @xcite ( for noncompact surfaces , definitions of the indices must be appropriately adjusted ) . because the two indices differ by at most one , we choose to use only @xmath0 here ( like in @xcite ) , without signifigantly weakening our results .",

    "as for closed cmc surfaces in @xmath8 , it is perhaps known only that the stable cmc surfaces are precisely the round spheres @xcite . also , a straightforward computation gives the index of flat tori of revolution , which we do here .",
    "but an analogous result to that of @xcite is not yet known for closed cmc surfaces in @xmath8 .",
    "even the morse index of closed cmc surfaces of revolution in @xmath8 is still unknown , so here we find lower bounds for the index of such surfaces .",
    "they come in three classes : ( 1 ) round spheres , ( 2 ) tori with two distinct axes of revolution , the _ flat _",
    "cmc tori , ( 3 ) tori with only one axis of revolution , the _ non - flat _ cmc tori .",

    "are all independent of how the surface @xmath98 is parametrized , clearly the same holds for the following @xmath0 and @xmath99 :    [ defstrongindex ] the _ index _ @xmath0 of @xmath1 is the sum of the multiplicities of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath2 , and the _ nullity _ @xmath99 is the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of @xmath2 .    defining @xmath100 , the eigenvalues of @xmath101 ( like for @xmath2 ) form a discrete sequence @xmath102 ( each considered with multiplicity 1 ) whose first eigenvalue @xmath103 is simple , and",
