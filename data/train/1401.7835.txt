    "the vitali theorem has been widely studied in the literature . for a historical survey ,",
    "see for instance @xcite and the bibliography therein .",
    "this theorem is a well - known milestone in integration theory , directly related with @xmath0 convergence and weak compactness .",
    "however it has also many applications in several branches of mathematics , for example in reconstruction of signals , integral and discrete operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the vitali theorem has been investigated even in the context of vector lattices with respect to different types of convergence ( see @xcite and its bibliography ) and in abstract convergence groups , not necessarily endowed with an order structure ( see @xcite ) .    also the modular spaces",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) are a rich field of research .",
    "they are a natural generalization of the lebesgue spaces @xmath0 and contain as particular cases the orlicz and the musielak - orlicz spaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in modular spaces",
    "the vitali theorem is often used in the problem of approximating a real - valued function @xmath1 by means of urysohn - type or sampling operators @xmath2 , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these operators are particularly useful in order to approximate a continuous or analog signal by means of discrete samples , and therefore they are widely applied for example in reconstructing images and videos .    in the classical literature ,",
    "a signal @xmath1 is considered as a real - valued function , defined on a ( bounded or not ) time interval . in these situations",
    ", usually it happens that the original signal or image is unknown , and it must be reconstructed from some sampled values of the type @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a fixed rate .",
    "so it would be advisable to consider the studied signal , for example , as a map defined on a ( finite or not ) time interval and taking values in a suitable space of random variables ( for more details related with these topics see also @xcite and the literature therein ) . in this context",
    ", it is natural to consider the tool of _ vector lattices_. moreover , also domains with infinite measure , like for instance an infinite time interval , can be treated .    in this paper",
    "we consider vector lattices with convergences generated by filters ( see also @xcite ) , which generalize classical ones . for example , when the filter involved is the class of all subsets of @xmath6 having asymptotic density one , we obtain the so - called statistical convergence .",
    "we introduce the theory of modular spaces in the vector lattice context : integration theory can be considered as a particular case of the theory of modulars , even in our setting , so we give a general version of the vitali and lebesgue dominated convergence theorems for modular convergence , with applications to integrals for vector lattice - valued functions , defined on sets of possibly infinite measure . in section 4",
    "we deal with moment kernels in the vector lattice setting , in order to construct a suitable sequence of convolution type operators ; moreover in subsection [ bm ] , among the applications , we give convergence results for the it integral with respect to brownian motion .",
