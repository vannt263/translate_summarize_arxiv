    "the purpose of this article is to give a first step towards the construction , by means of conformal methods , of einstein - yang - mills spacetimes with anti - de sitter - like boundary conditions . in this first analysis",
    "we make the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry , in order to highlight various issues concerning the choice of boundary conditions in the underlying initial boundary value problem . the construction of more general i.e .",
    "non - symmetric solutions to the einstein - yang - mills system with anti - de sitter boundary conditions will be treated elsewhere .",
    "our interest in anti - de sitter - like spacetimes stems from the numerical results for the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field system of @xcite which show evidence of turbulent instabilities in arbitrarily small perturbations of the ( vacuum ) anti - de sitter spacetime for reflexive boundary conditions see also e.g. @xcite for a further discussion and further references .",
    "as the aforementioned work shows , the assumption of spherical symmetry offers a natural starting point to analyse anti de sitter - like spacetimes , not only from a numerical point of view but also from an analytic perspective see e.g. @xcite the stability of the schwarzschild - ads spacetime for the spherically symmetric einstein - klein - gordon system .",
    "the construction of anti - de sitter - like spacetimes is a much more challenging problem than , say , the construction of de sitter - like spacetimes .",
    "these difficulties stem from the facts that anti - de sitter - like spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic and that a systematic construction requires the formulation of an _ initial boundary value problem _ as well as the identification of suitable boundary data . the first systematic construction of anti - de sitter - like spacetimes by means of an initial boundary value problem has been given in @xcite .",
    "this seminal work makes use the so - called _ conformal field equations _ together with a gauge based on the properties of _ conformal geodesics _ to show the _ local existence _ of a large class of anti - de sitter - like spacetimes .",
    "besides this analysis for the vacuum case , one should also mention the work in @xcite in which the well - posedness of the einstein - scalar field with anti - de sitter - like boundary conditions has been analysed .    from our point of view ,",
    "one of the key lessons of the analysis of @xcite is the derivation of the existence of a large class of _ maximally dissipative _ boundary conditions which ensure the well - posedness of the underlying initial boundary value problem used for the construction of the anti - de sitter - like spacetimes .",
    "in particular , these maximally dissipative boundary conditions allow one to prescribe the conformal class of the conformal boundary . in view of this",
    ", it is natural to ponder how crucial the role of the reflexive boundary conditions is in the formation of the instabilities observed in @xcite .",
    "the set up considered in @xcite is probably too general to be used as a starting point for the analysis of the stability / instability of the anti - de sitter spacetime . from this perspective",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry seems a good way to make inroads .",
    "as is well known , the trade - off for considering spherically symmetric configurations in general relativity is the need of coupling the gravitational field to some matter model in order to obtain non - trivial dynamics .",
    "if one intends to use conformal methods for the analysis of this kind of problem , the choice of matter models narrows to those possessing good conformal properties in particular yang - mills fields or the conformally invariant scalar field .",
    "the maxwell field is of no use in spherical symmetry as it leads to the reissner - nordstrm - anti - de sitter spacetime and trivial dynamics . in the present article",
    "we have opted to consider yang - mills fields as our matter model . from the point of view of its conformal properties and its coupling to the conformal einstein field equations , the yang - mills field is better behaved than the conformally invariant scalar field .",
    "this outweighs the fact that for the the yang - mills field one has to consider more matter fields .",
    "the spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills equations have been the subject of vast number of studies both analytic see e.g. @xcite and numeric see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is imporatnt to point out that in these studies the gauge freedom available in the specification of the gauge potential has been systematically used to eliminate one of the components of this field , and thus , to obtain a simpler system of equations to be solved . in this article",
    "the gauge freedom is used in a different manner to obtain a symmetric hyperbolic evolution system for the components of the gauge potential with nice properties at the conformal boundary .",
    "this different strategy in the use of the gauge freedom makes difficult a direct general comparison between the present analysis and other set ups although a case by case comparison can be certainly obtained if required .",
    "another point that should be stressed is that while most of the analysis of spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills spacetimes has been carried out for the in which the gauge group is @xmath0 , _ our analysis is completely general and makes no assumptions on the gauge group_.    in the present article we pursue a generalisation of the analysis in @xcite by combining it with the discussion of the conformal einstein - yang - mills equations given in @xcite and that of @xcite on the so - called _ extended conformal einstein field equations _ for einstein - maxwell . our strategy is to express the extended conformal einstein field equations in terms of a gauge based on the properties of certain conformally privileged curves , the so - called _ conformal curves _ , and in turn formulate a boundary value problem including the prescription of certain information on the conformal boundary @xmath1 .",
    "the solutions obtained from this initial boundary value problem are , in principle , global in space but local in time .",
    "it is well known that the assumption of spherical symmetry leads to a reduction in the number of evolution equations .",
    "in addition , this setting exhibits further structural properties which in our opinion deserve a separate treatment .",
    "one of the key objectives of the analysis in this article is to identify the boundary data to be prescribed at the conformal boundary in order to ensure the ( local ) existence of an anti - de sitter - like einstein - yang - mills spacetime .",
    "our analysis shows that the construction of a einstein - yang - mills spacetime by means of an initial boundary value problem allows to specify a certain combination of the components of the gauge field .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the null components of the gauge fields with respect to a frame adapted to the conformal boundary , then @xmath4 with @xmath5 a collection of smooth functions on the conformal boundary , constitutes a suitable class of _ maximally dissipative boundary conditions _ ensuring the well - posedness of the underlying initial boundary value problem . in the above expression @xmath6 denotes a suitable _ gauge index _ and no summation is understood on the repeated indices .",
    "our main result can be expressed as follows :    suppose one is given smooth spherically symmetric anti - de sitter - like initial data for the einstein - yang - mills equations on a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath7 with boundary @xmath8 .",
    "suppose further that the gauge potentials for the yang - mills field satisfy the boundary condition on a cylinder @xmath9\\times \\partial \\mathcal{s}$ ] for some @xmath10 , and that their initial data on @xmath7 satisfies certain compatibility conditions at the corner @xmath11 .",
    "then there exists a local - in - time solution to the einstein - yang - mills equations with an anti - de sitter - like cosmological constant which possesses a conformal completion such that on @xmath12 it implies the given initial data .",
    "moreover , this solution to the einstein field equations admits a conformal completion on @xmath13\\times\\mathcal{s}$ ] such that @xmath14\\times \\partial \\mathcal{s } $ ] corresponds to conformal boundary and the boundary conditions are satisfied on @xmath15 .    a detailed discussion of the assumptions made in the above result will be given in the main text see section [ section : main result ] , theorem [ theorem : maintheorempreciseversion ] .",
    "in particular , in section [ section : evolution equs ss ] the meaning of spherical symmetry in the present context will be made precise .",
    "the conditions at the corner @xmath16 ( corner conditions ) are a hierarchy of compatibility conditions between the boundary data and the initial data ensuring the smoothness of the solution to the initial boundary value problem .",
    "their precise form is discussed in section [ section : cornerconditions ] .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in order to close the problem it is necessary to specify an , in principle , arbitrary gauge source function @xmath17 on @xmath18 which fixes the value of the divergence of the yang - mills gauge potential 1-form .",
    "the specification of this gauge source function must be made in a manner which is consistent with boundary conditions .",
    "this consistency requirement is part of the corner conditions .",
    "a schematic representation of the result is given in the penrose diagram of figure [ figure : mainresult ] .",
    "the proof of the above result requires a careful specification of the gauge used to extract an evolution system out of the conformal field equations . in order to avoid a _ free boundary problem _ , we resort to a conformal gauge based on the properties of a class of curves with nice conformal properties , the so - called conformal curves see",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "a key feature of this gauge is that the conformal factor is known _ a priori _ since it can be expressed explicitly in terms of initial data .",
    "accordingly , the location of the conformal boundary is explicitly known as well .",
    "this feature considerably simplifies the problem and reduces complexity of the pde theory required to show well - posedness .",
    "concerning the above result , it should be pointed out that the boundary conditions contain , as a particular case , the _ reflective boundary conditions _ @xmath19 a further interesting property of the setting to be considered concerns the behaviour of the mass . as it will be discussed in more detail in the main text , the spherical symmetry of the setting forces the geometry of the metric intrinsic to the conformal boundary to be conformally flat .",
    "that is , the boundary metric is conformally related to the 1 + 2-dimensional analogues of the minkowski metric and the metric of the 1 + 2-dimensional einstein cylinder universe . for anti - de sitter - like spacetimes with this property there exists a well defined notion of mass see @xcite .",
    "a direct computation shows that for the class of spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills spacetimes constructed in this article the mass is , in general , not constant along the conformal boundary .     and",
    "@xmath1 denote , respectively an initial hypersurface and the conformal boundary .",

    "in particular , this section provides a discussion of the solutions to the constraints implied by the conformal field equations at the conformal boundary of the spacetime and of the behaviour of the mass of the spacetime .",
    "section [ section : spacetime gauge considerations ] introduces the concept of conformal curves and studies their properties at @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , lemma [ lemma : conformalcurvesconformalboundary ] proves the existence of conformal curves that remain tangent to the conformal boundary @xmath1 for all times .",
    "a congruence of conformal curves is used in section [ section : ibvp ] to construct a boundary adapted coordinate system which , in turn , is employed to formulate the initial boundary value problem . moreover ,",
    "the congruence is used to suitably fix the conformal gauge freedom so that a hyperbolic reduction of the conformal einstein - yang - mills field equations can be carried out .",
    "the equations are analysed in the setting of spherical symmetry in section [ section : evolution equs ss ] and in section [ section : boundary conditions ] the boundary conditions for the gauge potential @xmath20 are discussed .",
    "the main result on the existence of spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills spacetimes is proven in section [ section : main result ] , which also presents the technical version of our main theorem .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section [ section : discussion ] .",
