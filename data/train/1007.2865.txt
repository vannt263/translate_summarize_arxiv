    "low - lying collective excitations in weakly deformed , odd - mass nuclei have rarely been studied in detail due to the structural complexity arising from the interplay of various single - particle excitations and collective degrees of freedom . with increasing angular momentum for the ground and single - particle states , bountiful excitations and",
    "a distribution of strength among several levels occurs ; however , the weak coupling of a single particle to the bosonic core would provide structural simplifications .",
    "such a scenario is present in the low - energy structure of the weakly deformed odd - mass nucleus , @xmath12nb@xmath13 , which exhibits unique , unmixed structures built on the @xmath14 ground state and the @xmath9 proton - hole excited state .",

    "the @xmath16 term is much weaker than the @xmath17 one due to the strong cancellation of the spin @xmath26 .",
    "isovector excitations occur when nucleons and their spins are collectively excited .",
    "proton and neutron spin g factors are additive in the vector part of the magnetic dipole ( @xmath4 ) operator , which may lead to large @xmath4 transition strengths .",
    "the scissors mode  @xcite in deformed nuclei  @xcite and mixed - symmetry ( @xmath27 ) states in weakly - deformed even - even nuclei  @xcite are examples of collective isovector excitations .",
    "the latter was predicted by the algebraic interacting boson model-2 ( ibm-2 ) with separate representations for proton and neutron bosons  @xcite , and interpret as a collective motion of proton and neutrons not in phase .",
    "such isovector excitations have widely been identified in weakly - deformed even - even nuclei  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath17 excitations have been identified in the negative - parity structure of @xmath0nb built on the 2@xmath28 proton - hole excited state  @xcite . given the large quadrupole moment , @xmath29 , recently determined for the ground state  @xcite , the invocation of a simpler vibrational picture seems unnecessary , and this work provides a microscopic many - body interpretation of such isovector excitations .",
    "in fact , @xmath27 states have been explained from a shell - model ( @xmath30 ) basis by lisetskiy and collaborators  @xcite using a surface delta interaction with tuned parameters .",
    "large isoscalar @xmath5 matrix elements were found between states with @xmath27 assignments and interpreted as excitations with similar @xmath31 symmetry . in a microscopic many - body framework ,",
    "shell - model calculations using a @xmath32sr core and effective low - momentum interactions  @xcite have successfully accounted for excitation energies , level densities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 transition strengths , isoscalar and isovector excitations , and both spin and orbital contributions to the @xmath4 transition matrix elements in the negative - parity structure of @xmath0nb  @xcite .",
    "as a successor to that work , we present a more extensive spectroscopic and microscopic study of @xmath0nb , including both positive- and negative - parity structures .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0nb has been studied with the ( n , n@xmath33@xmath2 ) reaction at the university of kentucky and in a @xmath3zr(p,2n)@xmath0nb @xmath2-@xmath2 coincidence experiment at the university of cologne .",
    "excitation functions , lifetimes and branching ratios were measured using the @xmath0nb(n , n@xmath1@xmath2 ) reaction @xcite at neutron energies ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 mev .",
    "neutrons were provided by the 7-mv electrostatic accelerator at the university of kentucky through the @xmath34h(p , n)@xmath34he reaction . the scattering sample was 56 g of nb ,",

    "pulsed - beam techniques were used to reduce background , with beam pulses separated by 533 ns and bunched to about 1 ns . the time - of - flight technique for background suppression was employed by gating on the appropriate prompt time windows @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath2 rays were detected using a bgo compton - suppressed 55% hpge spectrometer with 2.0 kev resolution . both excitation functions and angular distributions were normalized to the neutron flux .    from the angular distribution experiments",

    "finally , the lifetimes of the states can be determined by comparison with the @xmath40 values calculated using the winterbon formalism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2-ray coincidences were observed through the ( n , n@xmath33@xmath2@xmath2 ) reaction at a neutron energy of 3 mev in order to identify the decay paths of @xmath2 rays , measure their branching ratios , and confirm the results from the excitation functions .",
    "the coincidence methods have been described by mcgrath _",

    "@xcite .      for odd - mass nuclei , particularly those with high ground - state spins ,",
    "the angular distributions of the photons from scattering reactions are rather isotropic , and the ( n , n@xmath41 ) data can not be used generally for assigning the spins of excited states .",
    "complementarily , from a @xmath2-@xmath2 coincidence experiment with the @xmath3zr(p,2n@xmath42)@xmath0nb reaction , many multipolarities and spin assignments could be determined , and branching ratios were measured . the proton beam provided by the 10-mv tandem accelerator at the university of cologne bombarded a 2 mg/@xmath43 thick @xmath3zr target enriched to 96.93@xmath44 with beam currents from 2 to 3 @xmath45a .",

    "the de - exciting @xmath2 rays were detected using the horus spectrometer  @xcite , comprised of 16 hpge detectors with the following features : a ) seven of the detectors formed a euroball cluster detector  @xcite with the central detector placed at @xmath39=90@xmath46 with respect to the beam axis and @xmath47=0@xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the clockwise angle around the beam axis ; b ) four detectors placed at @xmath39=45@xmath46 and 135@xmath46 in a vertical plane above and below the beam axis were complemented by compton suppression shields ; c ) the remaining detectors were placed in the @xmath39=90@xmath46 plane and at angles of @xmath47=55@xmath46 , 125@xmath46 , 235@xmath46 and 305@xmath46 . when possible , we determined the @xmath48 mixing ratio , @xmath49 @xcite , by fitting the angular correlation data as a function of the angles , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 , following the formalism developed by krane and steffen @xcite .",

    "in previous work by van heerden and mcmurray @xcite , angular momenta , parities and transition rates for several of the first ten states ( up to 1.1 mev ) were presented .",
    "the low - lying structure of @xmath0nb is dominated by the @xmath14 and @xmath53 single - particle and proton - hole excitations , respectively , and @xmath54 couplings built on these @xcite . in particular , the @xmath14 ground state couples to the 2@xmath55 state of the @xmath56zr core to give a quintet of isoscalar excitations , j@xmath57 @xmath58 5/2@xmath59 , 7/2@xmath59 , 9/2@xmath59 , 11/2@xmath59 and 13/2@xmath59 . the 3/2@xmath60 and 5/2@xmath60 states are also identified as being built on the low - lying @xmath53 excitation .",

    "the ms character of these large @xmath4 transitions can be confirmed in table [ tab : nb93m1 ] , where we see a sizable orbital component of the transitions .",
    "finally , a case can be made for proposing the 1603-kev 11/2@xmath59 state as a member of the @xmath17 quintet due to the experimentally observed @xmath4 transition to the 13/2@xmath55 one - phonon symmetric state .",
    "this is borne out in the calculations , where we see the expected equal distribution of spin and orbital @xmath4 transition strength .",
    "again , some mixing with higher @xmath16 excitations is likely manifested in the collective @xmath5 transition to the one - phonon symmetric states seen experimentally , which are also apparent in the @xmath30 .",
    "it would seem that a suitable candidate for the 13/2@xmath59 @xmath17 excitation is the 1686 kev state , with a large @xmath4 to both the 11/2@xmath55 and 13/2@xmath55 states observed experimentally .",
    "this , however , is unfortunately not apparent in the sm calculations as the @xmath4 transitions predicted are too weak to support this identification .",
    "in this work , we have investigated @xmath17 and @xmath16 excitations in the positive- and negative - parity structures of @xmath0nb .",
    "identifications are based on from @xmath4 and @xmath5 transition strengths , spin and parity assignments , and shell model calculations .",
    "these findings support the weak - coupling picture of fermions and bosons in both @xmath124@xmath7@xmath3mo and @xmath14@xmath7@xmath56zr configurations .",
    "the marked separation of the positive- and negative - parity structures in @xmath0nb facilitates the comprehension of such a relevant interaction , specially in the simpler scenario for the negative - parity states .",
    "overall , larger @xmath70 values are observed in this nucleus as compared with the even - a neighbors as the result of additional spin - flip effects .",
    "levels assigned as @xmath17 excitations lie at lower energies than that observed for the 2@xmath293 state in @xmath56zr ( 1.847 mev ) .",
    "interestingly , similar transition strengths of about 30 w.u .",
    "are found from the levels characterised as @xmath16 excitations .",
