    "biomolecular models are usually very high - dimensional systems . proteins in solution , as described in classical molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations , are characterized by the three  dimensional positions and velocities of tens or hundred of thousands atoms , thus defining a @xmath1@xmath2dimensional phase space .",
    "studying the result of a md simulation in such a high  dimensional space is outrageously difficult , and consequently one usually follows the behavior of low  dimensional ( often one  dimensional ) , collective variables ( cvs ) @xmath3 which are function of the high  dimensional coordinates @xmath4 of the system @xcite .    also in dealing with experiments",
    ", one can usually monitor only low  dimensional cvs .",
    "for example , the ellipticity in circular dichroism , the fluorescence intensity of tryptophanes or the nuclear chemical shifts in nmr spectra depend on the high  dimensional coordinates @xmath4 of a system but can provide only a low  dimensional view of its conformational properties .    while in the design of experiments the choice of the cvs to monitor is determined by the technique itself , in simulations one can choose to compute and analyze essentially any function of the microscopic coordinates .",
    "the problem is how to make such a choice . in the study of equilibrium properties of a system ,",
    "the only feature that the cv must have is to be able to distinguish the relevant phases of the system , that is to be a good `` order parameter '' . in the case of protein folding ,",
    "for example , it should assume different values in the native state , in the denatured state and , when relevant , in intermediate states .",
    "the root mean square deviation of the atomic positions ( rmsd ) with respect to those of the native conformation , or the fraction @xmath5 of native contacts usually can do that @xcite .",
    "the choice is less straightforward for the description of the time ",
    "dependent , dynamical properties of the system @xcite . for most purposes , it is useful that the cv @xmath0 obeys a langevin equation of kind @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a stochastic , gaussian variable with moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the bar indicates the average over the realisations of the stochastic variable . in this case , @xmath10 , which depends on the gradient of the equilibrium free energy @xmath11 , can be regarded as an effective force acting on the cv , and thus is very rich of information on the system ; @xmath12 is a position  dependent coefficient which controls the diffusion of @xmath0 within its low  dimensional space @xcite .    if eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) holds , one can use arrhenius equation to estimate reaction rates , can model the dynamics of the system as transitions between discrete states , and can use all the armoury of tools developed in the realm of langevin equations @xcite . besides the advantages in analysing and plotting _ a posteriori _ the relevant information , cvs satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) can be used on  the  fly to bias the dynamics of the system and thus speed - up equilibrium sampling , like in the case of umbrella sampling , metadynamics and steered molecular dynamics @xcite , or even to obtain efficiently dynamical properties @xcite . in the following , we shall call `` reaction coordinate '' any cv that satisfies eq . ( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) .",
    "an equation formally similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) can always be written for any cv .",
    "however , a bad choice of the cv results in functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 which depend not only on @xmath0 , but on the whole history of the system ; in other words , in this case @xmath0 undergoes a non  markovian process @xcite .",
    "this happens when @xmath0 does not really determine the properties of the relevant phase space where the dynamics of the system is likely to occur , but , on the contrary , to a given value of @xmath0 can correspond different , well  separated regions of the relevant microscopic phase space , in which the effective force @xmath13 and the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath14 are very different . in this case , having discarded the microscopic coordinates , only time can distinguish between the different phase ",
    "space regions at identical @xmath0 , resulting in a non  markovian dynamics .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) to hold is that @xmath0 describes the slowest kinetic modes of the system @xcite .",
    "this implies that the system can visit very quickly all the phase  space accessible regions for any fixed value of @xmath0 , thus equilibrating the coordinates perpendicular to it . in this context",
    ", fixed means that the relative change in value of @xmath0 is negligible with respect to that of the perpendicular coordinates . as a consequence , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are determined by the average contribution of all the phase  space regions displaying the same value @xmath0 , the time dependence is averaged out and only the dependence on @xmath0 remains .",
    "however , this is not a property which can be easily verified for any given function of the microscopic coordinates @xmath4 of the system .    the study of the dynamics of a system by eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) requires the evaluation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 from a set of microscopic trajectories .",
    "given a set of stochastic trajectories @xmath15 , generated with some md algorithm from a point @xmath16 of conformational space , the effective force and diffusion coefficient defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) in that point can be obtained by definition as the first two kramers  moyal coefficients @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath17 , then @xmath18 physically , the limit @xmath19 means that @xmath13 and @xmath14 should be a property of @xmath0 only , independent on where the trajectories go to afterwards . in the case of md simulations of biopolymers , the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : km ] ) presents a serious problem , namely that any integrator that can be used to generate @xmath15 has a finite time step , and thus the limit @xmath19 can not be evaluated .",

    "( [ eq : km ] ) in the limit of small @xmath20 , by correction terms @xcite , by iterative procedures @xcite , or by evaluating the adjoint fokker  planck operator @xcite .",
    "however one should stress that these works face the problem of evaluating @xmath13 and @xmath14 for generic time series of observables characterized by a low , uncontrollable , sampling rate . in the case of md simulations",
    ", the minimum time period can be as small as an integration time step , which is smaller than any process involved in the microscopic dynamics .    assuming to know the reaction coordinate @xmath0 , an efficient way of extracting drift and diffusion coefficient from md simulations was developed on the basis of a bayesian approach @xcite and then applied to protein folding @xcite .",
    "the main result of these works is that the diffusion coefficient for variables that scale as the euclidean distances between cartesian coordinates depends strongly on @xmath0 , while the diffusion coefficient for variables that have a filtered dependence on such distances , like contact functions , depend weakly on @xmath0 .    using a maximum  likelihood principle @xcite ,",
    "the drift and diffusion coefficients could be obtained as average of molecular dynamics trajectories , and a criterion for the choice of the sampling rate of the trajectories was introduced to minimize time correlations of noise .",
    "the goal of the present work is rather different from those discussed above .",
    "our primary task is that of investigating the validity of the framework defined by eq .",

    ", we studied the validity of the hypothesis at the basis of refs .",
    "another important difference is that , since we are interested in facing the problem from a computational perspective , we did not study directly the validity of true langevin equation ( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) , but its finite  differences counterpart , defined within the scheme of a standard integrator at finite time step @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , it is the finite  difference dynamic equation what one usually calculate in md simulations .    in next section",
    "we present an algorithm to obtain efficiently the drift and diffusion coefficient of the finite  time  step langevin equation .",
    "then we show to which extent @xmath13 and @xmath14 are function of @xmath0 only , and not depend on the detailed microscopy coordinates .",
    "we first applied this analysis to some test models and then to some popular cvs within simple alpha  helix and beta  hairpin models .",
    "finally , we studied to which extent the calculated coefficients are in agreement with the equilibrium free energy of the system , and the dynamics in the reduced space is in agreement with the projection of the associated microscopic dynamics .",

    "the effective dynamics can thus be a coarse  graining in time of the original dynamics . a relevant question we shall ask is then what is the most suitable time step @xmath20 for which eq .",

    "it is worth to point out that the two quantities compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] have a completely different origin .",
    "the effective force @xmath171 is calculated point  wise from dynamical simulations , while the free energy is obtained from an equilibrium sampling .",
    "moreover , the agreement occurs in spite of the large width of the distribution of drift and diffusion coefficients .    as a further test for the drift and diffusion coefficient we found , we compared the dynamics simulated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : red - langevin ] ) with the projection of the microscopic dynamics on the cv .",
    "this comparison is carried out for the case of the variable @xmath5 in the @xmath133hairpin , which gave the best results in the determination of the effective energy ( cf .",
    "[ fig : correlations]d ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics ] it is displayed the average and the standard deviation of @xmath5 as a function of time , over 100 simulations starting from the same unfolded conformation .",
    "although the overall folding time seems comparable in the two kind of simulations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]a ) , the detailed dynamics is different . in particular ,",
    "the microscopic dynamics displays a slightly faster initial folding , followed by a further event around 18 ps , which is not reported in the effective langevin dynamics .",
    "however , it is the run  to  run variability to be completely different in the two cases ( cf .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]b ) , being orders of magnitude smaller in the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the dynamical properties thus seem much more sensitive to the imperfections in the reaction coordinate than to the equilibrium properties .",
    "the results obtained in two one  dimensional test systems indicate that it is possible to back  calculate the diffusion coefficient with great precision ( i.e. , with an error lower than 1% ) by direct application of its finite  difference definition ( i.e. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : km2 ] ) ) if the drift coefficient is moderately small , that is if the drift does not induce a deterministic displacement within the time @xmath20 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : km2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the calculation of the drift coefficient directly by definition would require an enormous ( @xmath172 ) number of replicated simulations for each point of conformational space to obtain a stable result , and it is thus impractical .",
    "the strategy we developed based on an iterative solution of the finite  differences equations of motion allow one to back  calculate the drift coefficient with an error lower than 10% in the test cases , and to back  calculate correctly the diffusion coefficient also if the system undergoes strong drifts , up to those caused by nn forces , much stronger than typical biological forces .    in simulations carried out with simple models of alpha ",
    "helix and beta  hairpin , the distribution of drift coefficients for different point of conformational space associated with the same value of the fraction of native contacts @xmath5 has a spread which is of the order of half its average .",
    "this suggests that the cv @xmath5 defines a drift coefficient , although with a non ",
    "negligible error bar .",
    "the same is not true for the drmsd . in this case",
    "the drift coefficient is defined only in terms of its order of magnitude , the width of its distribution for fixed value of drmsd ranging from three to ten times the mean .",
    "anyway , for both variables the mean drift matches that obtained as derivative of the free energy , calculated independently from a conformational sampling at equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that it is possible to build a one  dimensional approximated model of these peptides , in which the equilibrium and the dynamical properties are consistent with each other .",
    "moreover , one could also exploit these results to calculate the equilibrium free energy of a system from short dynamical simulations .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is defined better than the drift for both the drmsd and the @xmath5 , the width of the associated distribution being in both cases at worst half of the mean , and usually lower .",
    "this fact gives a sound basis to the calculations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite for the diffusion coefficient , and make it possible to exploit strategies in which the diffusion coefficient is artificially biased to enhance conformational sampling .",
    "the large widths of the distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not really unexpected , since to a given value of @xmath5 or drmsd correspond conformations which can be conformationally very different , and thus can display different energetic properties .",
    "interestingly this is true for native  like conformations as well ( @xmath173 or drmsd@xmath174 nm ) , which are supposedly more homogeneous from the conformational point of view .",
    "most likely , the steep dependence of the potential function which is used in the present force field ( i.e. , containing terms like @xmath175 or @xmath176 ) and which reflect the true interaction between the atoms of the system , plays an important role in defining the width of the observed distributions .",
    "although the agreement between the calculated mean drift coefficient and the equilibrium free energy of the peptides is reasonably good , the detailed dynamics is quite different in the dimensional  reduced model , especially in terms of run  to  run fluctuations of the cv .",
    "this suggests that the dynamical properties are more sensitive to approximations than the equilibrium properties .",
    "this asymmetry was already observed for their respective dependence on the force field @xcite .",
    "the dimensional  reduction approach can be very useful to analyze complex biomolecular data and also to bias md simulations in order to decrease their computational cost .",
    "the dynamics of a system in a reduced dimensional space can be as complicated as that in the original , full  dimensional space if the reduced coordinate @xmath0 is not chosen carefully .",
    "if @xmath0 describes the slowest motion of the system , its dynamics is controlled by a simple langevin equation .",
    "however this condition is difficult to check directly in a system as complex as a biopolymer . here , we employed a different approach .",
    "we developed a method to calculate the drift and diffusion coefficient in the neighborhood of a microscopic point of the full  dimensional conformational space .",
    "this method is based on a finite  difference version of the langevin equation and an iterative evolution of the dynamics of @xmath0 under the approximation of locally linear force and locally constant diffusion coefficient .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the drift and diffusion coefficients for an ensemble of such points corresponding to the same value of the reduced coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that , as already reported , the coefficients calculated for the length ",
    "invariant collective coordinates ( like the contact function @xmath5 ) display a weaker dependence on the microscopic point than euclidean distances ( like the drmsd ) ,",
    "but anyway they are not negligible",
    ". nonetheless , the average drift coefficients are compatible with the equilibrium properties of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical properties are more sensitive to the lack of ideality of the reaction coordinate .",
