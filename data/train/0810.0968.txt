    "both families of models suffer from serious difficulties when modeling the leading arm .",
    "similar requirements as for the tidal models hold for the ram pressure stripping schemes concerning interaction timescales , unless the density of the extended gaseous halo of the mw is increased substantially over its observational estimates , amplifying the hydrodynamical interaction .",

    "the reader might ask why there is such an attention paid to the properties of the fitness function itself if it , in fact , does not seem to provide any physical information about the interacting system of the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath35 serves primarily as a driver to the ga engine .",

    "the fitness function then makes a link between the observable data and the initial state of the magellanic system .",
    "here we came to the benefits of spending time on studying the function @xmath35 : in principle , it allows for identification of all points / regions in the parameter space leading to reproduction of the observational data , and also an appropriate analysis of its behavior may evaluate sensitivity of the system to variations in different parameters , i.e. their importance to the evolution of the system .",
    "the parameter space of the interacting magellanic clouds is very extended .",

    "several functions were defined .",
    "first , we have @xmath53 which is the relative deviation of the 1d projected fitness @xmath52 from its mean value @xmath54 on the studied interval , where @xmath55 is the corresponding deviation from @xmath54 expressed for @xmath56 points @xmath57 of the projected function @xmath52 .",
    "we also calculate the relative change in @xmath52 as @xmath58    the behavior of @xmath35 is analyzed here in terms of its deviation from the reference levels , which are established by the mean values of the 1d projections @xmath54 .",
    "we found such an approach particularly useful if one wishes to distinguish between the large  scale and localized significant changes in @xmath35 .",
    "low values of both , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , indicate presence of a global plateau of @xmath52 , and thus weak dependence of the system on the j  th parameter .",
    "if the corresponding @xmath60 is of a significantly higher value , local peaks ( or wells ) exist .",
    "similarly , the overall considerable evolution of @xmath52 is revealed by high values of both @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "in such a case additional information is provided by the ratio of the functions ( [ relative_dev ] ) and ( [ relative_change ] ) . as the ratio approaches unity ,",
    "abrupt changes in @xmath52 are favored over its smooth and slow evolution .",
    "the intention of this section is to apply the method for the fitness function analysis introduced in sec .",
    "[ understand_f ] to the magellanic system .",
    "the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are helpful if features and behavior of the fitness function @xmath35 are studied in the neighborhood of an arbitrary point in the parameter space . however , to answer the above raised questions , an approach somewhat less detailed is sufficient .",
    "we suggest to treat the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 statistically and to calculate their mean values @xmath61 and @xmath62 over all 120 ga fits for both global and local scale cases .",
    "the function @xmath35 may be characterized by significantly different values of @xmath59 or @xmath60 depending on the selected point in the parameter space .",
    "but for now , we are particularly interested in general trends in the behavior of the fitness function ( i.e. the behavior of our model for the interaction ) that should be expected if one studies the impact of variations in a selected parameter . as we will learn later , the identified ga fits cover a large fraction of the total parameter space volume .",

    "several perigalactic approaches of the clouds are expected by the tidal models @xcite .",
    "shorter timescales for the interaction may be sufficient within the ram pressure scenario @xcite . however , the proper motions by @xcite lead to timescales further dramatically reduced , as the clouds should be approaching the galaxy for the first time @xcite .",

    "[ understand_f ] : the parameters are not of the same importance for the properties of @xmath35 .",
    "table  [ table_f ] indicates that the sensitivity of the magellanic system to the choice for the lmc / smc proper motions is significantly higher than in case of any of the remaining parameters this conclusion is well illustrated by figure  [ 2dvelocitylmc ] depicting the fitness landscape projected to the plane of the lmc proper motion components .",

    "the fact that the proper motion of the smc is even more critical than that of the lmc indicates , that both clouds serve as sources of matter for the magellanic large scale structures , but the smc contribution responds to the choice for the orbit more strongly .",

    "it is also a notable fact that the values of both functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 decreased systematically over all studied parameters as we switched to the local scale of the parameter space .",
    "it means that the fitness function @xmath35 does not have a fractal  like ( irregular ) structure , and the probability of missing steep high peaks ( i.e. isolated quality models ) in the fitness landscape may be reduced by running the ga search again on that sub  region of the original parameter space , which is of a particular interest .",

    "we have analyzed the influence of the involved parameters on the tidal interaction in the magellanic system .",
    "reproduction of the hi observational data @xcite by the restricted n  body simulation turned out to be critically dependent on the current spatial velocities of the clouds",
    ".    since the effective resolution of the search can be improved by reducing the volume of the studied parameter space ( as justified earlier in this section ) , two sets of the lmc / smc proper motion ranges were assumed . after including every proper motion estimate available up to date , only the values by @xcite were involved to allow for a high  resolution search on the local scale of the parameter space . with the use of ga , @xmath70 parameter combinations , i.e. individual n  body simulations ,",
    "were tested in total , and 120 sets providing the highest fitness were collected for each of the studied volumes of the parameter space .    the resulting models are not considered acceptable unless they produce both leading and trailing hi magellanic structures ( the leading arm and the magellanic stream ) .",
    "thus , to allow for quantitative statements , a threshold level of @xmath35 had to be established . in order to do so",

    "the value of @xmath35 never exceeds 0.3 if calculated only for the leading arm .",
    "it is the magellanic stream that turned to be very sensitive to the choice for the model parameters , and critically influencing the resulting fitness .",
    "figure  [ 3d_maps ] illustrates the above discussed facts . while the model of @xmath71 ( global scale ) is able to fit the basic features of the magellanic stream both in the projected hi distribution and the lsr radial velocity profile , the best model for the increased lmc / smc spatial velocities ( @xmath72 , local scale ) places the magellanic stream to the position ",
    "velocity space incorrectly , as the @xmath73kms@xmath16 tip of the stream is shifted towards the clouds by @xmath74 compared to the observations ( 1 pixel in fig .",
    "[ 3d_maps ] equals roughly to @xmath75 in the plane of sky ) , and the modeled morphology differs seriously from the observed structure of the magellanic stream . generally speaking ,",
    "the described behavior of the modeled trailing stream is responsible for the resulting fitness of a given model , and was used to define the desired threshold level of the @xmath35 value .    unlike the local scale analysis ,",
    "the global search of the entire parameter space always resulted in a model placing the high negative radial velocity tip of the stream to the correct projected position , and the modeled trailing stream filled roughly the same area of the hi data  cube as the observed magellanic stream .",
    "following the mentioned fact , we selected the worst of the 120 fits from the global scale search to represent the threshold level of the fitness and so @xmath76 defines satisfactory models of the magellanic system",
    ".    figure  [ 2dvelocitylmc ] indicates , that the sub  region of the ( @xmath77 , @xmath2)plane introduced by @xcite does not allow for any satisfactory models assuming the pure tidal interaction .",
    "such a conclusion is also confirmed by the local scale search restricted to the hst proper motion data only ( lower plot of figure  [ 2dvelocitylmc ] ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ 2dvelocitylmc ] denotes that it is not possible to simulate the evolution of the magellanic system by pure tidal models if the spatial velocity of the lmc is as high as predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , such a speculation can only be confirmed if the entire parameter space of the interaction is explored , as it is based on the behavior of the fitness function @xmath35 in the neighborhood of the selected point .",
    "figure  [ fit - mulmc ] summarizes our results .",
    "the value of every local peak of the fitness function @xmath35 ( i.e. the fitness of every model identified by ga ) for the interaction of the mw  lmc ",
    "smc system is plotted as function of the @xmath77 and @xmath2 proper motion components for the lmc .",
    "while the northern component @xmath77 allows for satisfactory modeling of the magellanic system over the entire global range , the situation is quite different for the lmc proper motion in the western direction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the upper right plot of figure  [ fit - mulmc ] clearly indicates that the tidal scheme fails unless the @xmath2 values by @xcite are reduced by @xmath78% to reach @xmath79masyr@xmath16 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the proper motion component @xmath2 controls the galactocentric spatial velocity of the lmc .",
    "hence , one can easily see that the pure tidal models of the magellanic system constantly fail for the spatial velocities putting the lmc on highly eccentric or maybe unbound orbits about the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was verified and confirmed by the local scale parameter study focusing on the proper motion ranges by @xcite . despite our efforts , no even decent models were found over this portion of the parameter space ( see the lower row of figure  [ fit - mulmc ] ) .",
    "please note also that the concentration of the ga fits towards lower values of @xmath2 still remains even for the reduced velocity ranges .    within the original volume of the parameter space , assuming the tidal interaction , no satisfactory reproduction of the hi data by @xcite was achieved for the hst proper motions . in agreement with the previous studies , the model succeeded only if the clouds were moving at substantially lower galactocentric velocities .",
    "the following high  resolution analysis of the local scale of the parameter space ( the proper motion ranges for the clouds were restricted to the hst velocity data ) did not change the previous result and no specific quality parameter combinations were revealed . regarding the above summarized facts and results ,",
    "we conclude that the dynamical evolution of the magellanic system with the currently accepted total mass of the mw can not be explained in the framework of pure tidal models for the proper motion data by @xcite within their 1@xmath0 errors .",
    "the new results introduced by @xcite have serious consequences for our understanding of the dynamical evolution of the magellanic system , and in a wider context they influence our view of the local group and its formation . such facts , together with the key result of this paper indicating a conflict between the tidal models and observations of the magellanic system ,",
    "lead us necessarily to the questions about the reliability of the original hst data and correctness of their treatment by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the first issue can not be addressed until the hst measurements are cross  checked by an instrument of a competitive resolution and other significant physical characteristics . in a close future",
    ", the gaia mission should allow for high  precision astrometry , and hopefully the magellanic clouds and their proper motions will become objects of its interest as soon as possible .",
    "recently , an interesting constraint on the current velocity of the lmc was introduced by @xcite .",
    "they were able to estimate the galactocentric distance to the cross  section of the magellanic leading arm with the gaseous disk of the mw .",
    "although the observed part of the leading arm does not necessarily trace the future orbit of the lmc ( the leading arm is believed to lead the magellanic system ) , the measured position puts the lower limit on the galactocentric distance to the point of the next passage of the lmc through the galactic plane . following @xcite ,",
    "the estimated distance is not at odds with the value obtained by adopting the current lmc velocity by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above discussed issue , a verification of the distances to the main bodies of the clouds may be worth a consideration .",
    "space velocities also depend on the distances to the lmc / smc , which should be checked carefully in future to clarify how far they may influence our conclusions .    concerning the hst proper motion data processing by @xcite ,",
    "both papers indicate that the data were analyzed and interpreted very carefully and the adopted method is well justified . a very strong support to the conclusions by @xcite came recently from the study by @xcite who also derived the lmc and the smc current proper motions from the original hst data . @xcite",
    "introduced a different method to process the lmc / smc stellar proper motions , but their results agree with the findings by @xcite very well .",
    "they were able to reduce the lmc / smc proper motion errors by the factor of 3 compared to @xcite due to their modified treatment of the original data .",
    "however , while their 1@xmath0 proper motion errors of the lmc are completely embedded within the corresponding error estimates by @xcite , the mean value of smc proper motion component @xmath80 is offset by + 0.41masyr@xmath16 compared to @xcite ( see fig .  [ lmc_smc_pm ] ) .",
    "it means that the region of the parameter space delimited by the 1@xmath0 proper motion errors by @xcite entered our global scale analysis , but it was not explored by the local scale search .",
    "nevertheless , there is no indication that such a high  resolution exploration might alter significantly the results obtained for the global scale search . since the only difference between the results by @xcite and those by @xcite exists for the western proper motion component of the smc , the eq .",
    "( [ fitness_step_4 ] ) yields a typical growth in the models fitness of @xmath81 as one switches from @xcite to @xcite , because the @xmath80 estimate by @xcite is by @xmath82masyr@xmath16 lower than the result by @xcite .",
    "the overall quality of the models for the @xcite data is then well below the fitness threshold level established in sec .",
    "[ spatial_motion ] . under such conditions",
    "it is extremely unlikely to expect any significant revision of the global scale parameter search by the high resolution analysis of the proper motions by @xcite .    if we admit that the latest observational estimates of the current proper motion for both magellanic clouds are correct , what would be the impact on our understanding of the magellanic system and its evolution ?",
    "we showed that the pure tidal stripping is insufficient to redistribute the hi gas in the system to conform the available observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the classical model scheme by @xcite offers an extremely simplified view of the physical processes influencing galactic interactions .",
    "our results , together with the conclusions by @xcite , do not allow for more than little doubts , that despite the high spatial velocities of the clouds , the models of the interaction may succeed if sufficiently efficient physical mechanisms are introduced .",
    "in the first order , the ram pressure stripping @xcite scenario is well worth further efforts , since its efficiency strongly depends on several only weakly constrained parameters , namely the density of the extended gaseous halo of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the ram pressure force scales as @xmath4 with the relative velocity of the interacting objects , and so the high spatial velocities of the clouds by @xcite may compensate the effect of the corresponding reduced timescale for the interaction with the gaseous halo of the galaxy .",
    "recently , the paper by @xcite offered an exciting alternative to the tidal / ram pressure models , considering the possible intense ejection of mass from several star  forming regions in the lmc super  shells .",
