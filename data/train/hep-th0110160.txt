    "the study of induced chern - simons terms in @xmath3 dimensional field theory at finite temperature has produced some interesting new insights into large gauge invariance and parity - violating effective actions at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "almost all previous studies ( with the exception of @xcite ) have concentrated on the induced chern - simons term arising from fermion loop contributions to the gauge field self - energy in @xmath3 dimensions . in this paper",
    "we study finite temperature induced chern - simons terms in a bosonic theory .",
    "the induced chern - simons terms are generated in radiative loop corrections , due to the presence of a bare chern - simons term .",
    "specifically , we consider a maxwell - chern - simons - higgs model in the spontaneously broken phase . at zero temperature ,",
    "induced chern - simons terms in such models have been studied in great detail , revealing an intricate relation between spontaneous parity violation and spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "one motivation for this present paper is to understand how this generalizes to finite temperature .",
    "the induced chern - simons coefficient is extracted from the zero - momentum limit of the parity violating part of this self - energy @xcite . at finite t , this procedure is not unique @xcite since feynman diagrams are not analytic in external momenta at finite temperature @xcite , because the thermal heat bath breaks lorentz invariance . in a static limit , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "an induced chern - simons term is found with a temperature dependent coefficient @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite , this result appears ( when carried over to a non - abelian theory ) to violate large gauge invariance since the coefficient of the induced chern - simons term in a non - abelian theory should take discrete values @xcite .",
    "this puzzle has been resolved for the fermion loop when the background has the character of a static abelian magnetic field with integer flux @xmath6 , because in this case the problem factorizes into @xmath6 copies of an exactly solvable @xmath7-dimensional model @xcite .",
    "then one finds that the finite temperature effective action has an infinite series of parity - violating terms ( of which the chern - simons term is only the first ) , each of which has a t dependent coefficient at finite t. nevertheless , the series is such that the full effective action changes under a large gauge transformation in a manner that is independent of t. these new parity - violating terms are non - extensive ( i.e. , they are not integrals of a density ) and they explicitly vanish at zero temperature ( as they must since the zero t effective action should be extensive ) .",
    "this issue of large gauge invariance of the finite temperature effective action is considerably more difficult to resolve in genuinely time - dependent and genuinely non - abelian backgrounds , although much recent progress has been made in understanding the parity - violating parts of multi - leg amplitudes at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "another motivation for our study is the question of the analytic structure of the bosonic self - energy at finite temperature .",
    "this issue has been analyzed previously @xcite for massive gauge bosons in four dimensional space - time , where the chern - simons parity - violating issues are not relevant . in the four dimensional case",
    "it was found that in the broken phase the different bosonic masses appearing in the bosonic loop meant that the zero energy - momentum limit was actually analytic , despite the well - known physical difference between the debye and plasmon masses , which can be defined through the static and long wavelength limits , respectively @xcite . in this current paper",
    ", we find that in three dimensional space - time , for a model with parity violation , the zero energy - momentum limit is not unique , even though the bosonic masses entering the one - loop calculation are different .    in section",
    "ii we define the bosonic model to be studied , and present the finite temperature propagators necessary for a perturbative analysis . in section",
    "iii we present the one loop results for the parity violating part of the finite temperature self energy in both the static and long wavelength limits .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider an abelian gauge field @xmath8 in @xmath3 dimensions with both a maxwell and a chern - simons term in the lagrangian , interacting with a charged scalar field @xmath6 which has a symmetry breaking quartic potential : @xmath9 in the spontaneously broken phase , where @xmath6 has a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath10 , we expand the scalar field about this v.e.v . as @xmath11 and obtain the following lagrangian in the @xmath12 gauge ( ignoring the ghost lagrangian which is not relevant to our calculations ) :    @xmath13    here the various mass parameters are @xmath14 as mentioned above in the introduction , for the corresponding system _ without _ the chern - simons term ( i.e. for @xmath15 ) , the finite temperature behavior of the polarization tensor was studied in @xcite . there , one of the key features was the difference between the bosonic masses appearing in the one - loop calculation .",
    "the model _ with _ a chern - simons term is more interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , the presence of the chern - simons term leads to a different mass generation mechanism for the gauge field , with it acquiring two ( rather than one ) massive modes in the broken phase @xcite .",
    "second , the chern - simons coupling leads to parity - violating contributions to the polarization tensor , whose finite temperature behavior is the subject of this paper .",
    "both these differences can be seen clearly in the propagator structure of the model .      at zero temperature",
    ", the gauge field propagator is @xmath16 \\label{ztprop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two massive modes are identified by the poles at @xmath17 from which we deduce the ( positive ) masses @xmath18 note also the presence in @xmath19 of the term proportional to @xmath20 , which manifestly breaks parity .",
    "the scalar field @xmath21 has the standard bosonic propagator @xmath22 .      at finite t ,",
    "propagators can be presented either in the imaginary - time or real - time formalism @xcite . here",
    "we record the propagators in both forms for the model in ( [ fluclag ] ) .      in the imaginary - time formalism ,",
    "the gauge field propagator is ( @xmath23 in the euclidean space )    @xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the scalar @xmath21 field propagator is @xmath25 here , @xmath26 are the usual bosonic matsubara modes .      in the real - time formalism , the degrees of freedom are doubled in the standard way @xcite in order to account for the transfer of energy into and out of the thermal heat bath .",
    "the propagators thus acquire a @xmath27 matrix structure , the components of which are listed below , in the closed time path formalism , for the mcsh system in the broken phase . for the gauge field ,    @xmath28\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\frac{1}{(p^2 - m_+^2 + i   \\epsilon ) ( p^2 - m_-^2 + i   \\epsilon ) } - 2 i   \\pi n_b(|p^0| ) \\delta ( ( p^2-m_+^2)(p^2-m_-^2))\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\theta(-p^0 ) + n_b(|p^0|)\\right]\\delta((p^2-m_+^2)(p^2-m_-^2))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath30\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\theta(p^0 ) + n_b(|p^0|)\\right]\\delta((p^2-m_+^2)(p^2-m_-^2))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath31\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\frac{-1}{(p^2 - m_+^2 -i   \\epsilon ) ( p^2 - m_-^2 - i   \\epsilon ) } - 2 i   \\pi n_b(|p^0| ) \\delta ( ( p^2-m_+^2)(p^2-m_-^2))\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the scalar @xmath21 field ,    @xmath32    @xmath33 \\delta(p^2-m_{\\sigma}^2)\\ ] ]    @xmath34 \\delta(p^2-m_{\\sigma}^2)\\ ] ]    @xmath35",
    "in this section we compute the parity - violating part , @xmath36 , of the polarization tensor @xmath37 , as represented by the one - loop feynman diagram in fig .",
    "the parity - violating contribution arises from the @xmath38 part of the gauge propagator .",
    "we first review briefly the zero temperature result .    -2 cm      the parity - violating part of the diagram in fig . 1 is @xmath39 a straightforward use of feynman parameters shows that this can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 the induced chern - simons coefficient is deduced from the value of @xmath42 : @xmath43 notice that the dependence on the three different masses , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is quite involved .    at this stage",
    "we pause to compare with some previous results corresponding to special cases of this result . in the pure chern - simons limit , in which the maxwell term is removed from the lagrangian ,",
    "the corresponding result was computed in @xcite .",
    "this limit can be obtained from our result by sending @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in such a way that the ratio @xmath49 is kept finite . in terms of the masses , in this limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( finite ) , and @xmath44 is unaffected . in this limit",
    ", our result reduces to @xmath52 which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when the remaining masses , @xmath44 and @xmath46 , are equal , this gives @xmath53 this is exactly the mass relationship ( @xmath50 and @xmath54 ) that arises in the n=2 supersymmetric chern - simons - higgs system @xcite , and this result ( [ ztsusy ] ) agrees with the known result for this susy model @xcite .",
    "the fact that ( [ ztsusy ] ) is equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign , to the fermion - loop contribution @xcite to the parity - violating part of the polarization tensor , reflects the non - renormalization of the chern - simons coefficient in the n=2 susy model .",
    "we now consider the calculation of the finite temperature one - loop parity - violating part of the polarization tensor .",
    "such a calculation can be performed either using the imaginary time or the real time formalism of finite temperature field theory . in this paper",
    "we record the imaginary time calculation ; we have also done the calculation using the real time formalism ( the appropriate amplitudes to compare are the retarded ones ) , and obtain exactly the same results .    in the imaginary - time formalism ,",
    "the parity - violating part of @xmath37 is @xmath55 where the matsubara energies are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 being integers .      at finite temperature",
    "there are different physical limits for the external energy - momentum @xmath60 , due to the preferred lorentz frame of the heat bath .",
    "these different limits reflect different physical processes @xcite .",
    "we first consider the _ static limit _ in which we first set @xmath61 , and then take the limit @xmath62 .",
    "first , observe that in this static limit , @xmath63 since the @xmath64 sum ( i.e. the sum over @xmath58 ) clearly vanishes when the index @xmath65 .",
    "the remaining parity - violating components are : @xmath66 the induced chern - simons coefficient is determined by the coefficient of @xmath67 in the limit @xmath62 , so we look for the term linear in the spatial momentum @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we expand @xmath69 the first term in this expansion contributes 0 when the spatial @xmath70 momentum integral is done in ( [ static0i ] ) . however , the second term produces a term linear in @xmath68 . using symmetric integration ,",
    "we replace @xmath71 , and obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73    it is convenient to perform the sum over matsubara modes using the sommerfeld - watson transformation @xcite of the sum into a contour integral : @xmath74 where the sum is over the residues at the poles of @xmath75 .",
    "thus , defining @xmath76 we find that @xmath77 \\label{sw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can separate the zero temperature contribution from the finite temperature correction by using the simple identity @xmath78 in which we recognize the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath79 . then the zero temperature contribution can be expressed as @xmath80\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these integrals may be performed with a consistent uv regulator , yielding a finite result that agrees precisely with the zero temperature result quoted in ( [ ztpi ] ) ( it is worth noting here that the chern - simons coefficient in the euclidean space is @xmath81 times that of the minkowski space ) .    the finite temperature correction to this zero temperature result is given by @xmath82 \\label{ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we need to evaluate an integral of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we note that @xmath85 @xmath86 where the @xmath87 are the bernoulli numbers .",
    "therefore , the high temperature expansion of @xmath88 is @xmath89\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\beta^3}\\left[2\\zeta(3)+(m\\beta)^2\\left(\\log(m\\beta)-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\dots\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , in the static limit , at high temperature , the leading behavior is @xmath90 where @xmath91 it is very interesting to notice that the temperature dependence inside the logarithmic terms cancels out , leaving logarithms only involving ratios of the masses @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "we now consider this result in the mass limits considered in section iii a. first , we take the pure chern - simons limit in which @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . from the above , in this limit",
    "the leading high temperature behavior is @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath95 susy limit where we further require that the two remaining masses are equal ( _ i.e. _ @xmath96 ) , we find @xmath97 indeed , in this susy case we can keep the full temperature dependence .",
    "returning to the expressions ( [ stat ] ) and ( [ sw ] ) which have the full temperature dependence , we can take the limit @xmath50 , and @xmath98 , to obtain a remarkable simplification : @xmath99 at zero temperature this reduces to the result in ( [ ztsusy ] ) . as mentioned before , at zero temperature , ( [ ztsusy ] ) cancels against a fermion loop contribution of equal magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "but at finite temperature , the corresponding fermion loop contributes @xmath100 which does not cancel the bosonic loop contribution ( [ bt ] ) , except at zero temperature .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the nonzero temperature breaks the supersymmetry of the system @xcite .      in this section",
    "we consider the long wavelength limit at finite temperature .",
    "in this limit we set @xmath101 , and consider @xmath102 .",
    "this must be done with care in the imaginary time formalism , because @xmath103 is discrete and must be analytically continued back to real time where it is a continuous variable . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "the parity violating part of the polarization tensor is @xmath104 by symmetry it is clear that @xmath105 while @xmath106 is nonzero .",
    "this is the opposite of what was found above in the static limit , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , @xmath109 the sum over matsubara modes can be done , as before , using a contour integral representation @xmath110\\left[(z+\\frac{\\beta p_0}{2\\pi})^2+(\\frac{\\beta \\omega_+}{2\\pi})^2\\right]\\left[(z+\\frac{\\beta p_0}{2\\pi})^2+(\\frac{\\beta \\omega_-}{2\\pi})^2\\right]}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{{\\rm coth}(\\frac{\\beta \\omega_\\sigma}{2})}{\\omega_\\sigma}\\ , \\frac{(-p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)}{[(-p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)^2+\\omega_+^2 ] [ ( -p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)^2+\\omega_-^2]}- \\frac{{\\rm coth}(\\frac{\\beta \\omega_\\sigma}{2})}{\\omega_\\sigma}\\ , \\frac{(p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)}{[(p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)^2+\\omega_+^2 ] [ ( p^0+i\\omega_\\sigma)^2+\\omega_-^2]}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",

    "we write @xmath111 where @xmath112 \\label{lwfull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once again , we separate the zero temperature piece from the finite temperature correction using the simple identity ( [ identity ] ) .",
    "then the zero temperature part of ( [ lwfull ] ) is finite , with consistent uv regulators for the momentum integrals , and agrees precisely with the direct zero temperature result in ( [ ztpi ] ) .",
    "the nonzero temperature contribution can be expressed as @xmath113\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dominant contribution at high temperature is easily computed using the integrals listed earlier in ( [ int1],[int2 ] ) .",
    "this dominant contribution in the long wave limit , at high temperature , gives @xmath114 we note several things about this result .",
    "first , there is still a logarithmic dependence on the temperature .",
    "second , the long wavelength limit gives a completely different result for the parity violating part of the self energy , as compared to the static limit .",
    "this is true even though the two masses in the bosonic loop are quite different .",
    "so , there is still a non - analyticity in the self - energy , contrary to what had been found earlier in a simpler model @xcite without parity violation .",
    "for completeness , we note here that , at high temperature , the contribution due to a fermion loop to the chern - simons term goes as @xmath115 in the static limit and as @xmath116 in the long wave limit @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we emphasize that the induced chern - simons terms that appear from bosonic loops have a completely different temperature dependence from those induced by a fermion loop .",
    "for example , for the bosonic loops the static limit of the graph grows at high temperature , while the fermionic loop contribution vanishes at high temperature .",
    "this is most clearly seen by comparing the static limit results ( [ bt ] ) and ( [ fft ] ) in the model with mass parameters such that the zero temperature model has an n=2 supersymmetry . in fact , the contributions from the bosonic loop grows at high temperature both in the static as well as the long wavelength limits , as opposed to the contributions from the fermionic loop which goes down with temperature in both these limits @xcite .    in the model studied in this paper ,",
    "the induced chern - simons terms arise in loop corrections because of the presence of a parity violating bare chern - simons term in the bare lagrangian .",
    "this bare chern - simons term has a number of consequences .",
    "first , it gives the gauge field two massive modes in the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "second , it introduces parity violating interactions .",
    "we have shown that the induced parity violating contributions to the self energy behave , at finite temperature , in a very different way from the parity preserving contributions studied previously in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the parity preserving terms have a unique zero momentum limit , even at finite temperature , while the parity violating terms have a non - unique limit at finite temperature .",
    "we have demonstrated this by computing the parity violating terms in both the static and long wavelength limit .",
    "the leading high temperature parts for these parity violating terms are given in ( [ static1],[static2 ] ) and ( [ lw1 ] ) , and they are clearly different . in the long wavelength limit there is a logarithmic dependence on the temperature , while in the static limit this cancels out leaving logarithmic dependence on mass ratios .",
    "in addition , we have analyzed the limit in which the mass parameters are such that the zero temperature model has an n=2 supersymmetry , and have seen explicitly how the susy is broken at finite temperature in the form of a non - cancellation between bosonic loop and fermionic loop contributions .",
    "we understand @xcite that m. gomes and collaborators are analyzing a related model involving a pure chern - simons gauge lagrangian coupled to a higgs field with a sextic potential",
    ". it would be interesting to compare their results to ours in the appropriate limit .    finally",
    ", the temperature dependent parity violating contributions to the self - energy mix with the temperature dependent parity conserving contributions in order to determine the physical masses in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this issue has been analyzed in @xcite for the chern - simons - yang - mills system at finite temperature .",
