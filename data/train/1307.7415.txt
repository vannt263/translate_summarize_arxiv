    "an ideal noiseless amplifier performs the operation @xmath9",
    "@xcite , that is it takes an input state @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this operator takes the coherent state @xmath12 to the coherent state @xmath13 and is inherently not unitary .",
    "this suggests that a measurement process with post - selection on the measurement outcomes is required to implement it .",
    "the case we are most interested in here is where @xmath14 . in this situation",
    "the operator is unbounded and can only be implemented perfectly over the entire hilbert space via a measurement process with probability zero . in many experimental situations the action of this operator on states with high occupation number are not important as they have negligible amplitude .",
    "therefore this operator is generally chosen to be truncated at some occupation number @xmath15 , which will be chosen depending on the desired performance of an experimental apparatus .",
    "this truncation allows for non - zero probabilities of successfully implementing the desired amplification transformation .",
    "lower values of @xmath15 will generally result in higher probabilities of success at the cost of a lower fidelity of operation when compared to the ideal operation . in current experiments with low energy inputs",
    "@xmath16 is sufficient to achieve high fidelity , and this very simple case has non - trivial implications .",
    "when constructing a measurement which implements the amplification , it suffices to consider the case where there is only two outcomes , a success outcome and a failure outcome .",
    "when a success outcome is achieved the state is transformed in the required way .",
    "measurement outcomes , which we will label @xmath17 are represented by @xmath18 for success and @xmath19 for failure .",
    "the action on the input state due to each measurement result can be represented by the generally non - unitary operator @xmath20 called the measurement operator .",
    "the probability of success for this measurement outcome when the measurement is applied to the state @xmath10 is given by @xmath21 and the resultant output state having achieved the result @xmath17 is @xmath22 to ensure that these operators define a probability measure the condition @xmath23 must be satisfied  @xcite .    to implement the amplification we require @xmath24 .",
    "to ensure holds over the entire hilbert space it would be necessary for @xmath25 as the eigenvalues of @xmath26 are unbounded for @xmath14 and @xmath27 must be a positive operator .",
    "now we can make the truncation of this operator to achieve a non - zero probability .",
    "we do this by requiring the action on the first @xmath15 fock states to be proportional to the those same elements for the perfect amplification operator and leaving the action on higher occupation number states arbitrary . in this case",
    "the success measurement operator can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a sequence of complex numbers with norm between zero and one .",
    "this will then allow the operation to satisfy with @xmath30 playing the role of the proportionality constant and will in general be non - zero .",
    "the probability of success for an arbitrary input state @xmath10 is    @xmath31    to ensure that @xmath32 for all possible input states @xmath33 .",
    "here we can see that any complex phase factor within each @xmath34 will not influence the probability of success .",
    "the fidelity of the success operation for pure state inputs is @xmath35    here the complex phase factors of the @xmath34 are important .",
    "however if the @xmath34 are not real than this can only act to reduce the fidelity .",
    "therefore , to maximise the fidelity and probability over the widest set of states then requires @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this optimised measurement operator is then @xmath38",
    "we can construct a model for the generalised measurement described in eq .",
    "[ eq : successmo ] by considering a measurement apparatus consisting of a two level system which interacts with the bosonic input mode as shown in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "axis spin eigenstate .",
    "the interaction applies a conditional unitary rotation where the conditioning depends on the number of bosons in the input .",
    "the apparatus is measured and if the spin has flipped then a success is heralded . ]    after the interaction the apparatus is measured using a projective measurement scheme .",
    "the apparatus orthonormal basis states represent success and failure and will be written as @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "this basis is arbitrary , but the interaction will depend on the particular choice of basis .",
    "we will assume that the apparatus is prepared in the @xmath40 state before the interaction .",
    "the interaction is given by the unitary operator @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the operator which will be applied to the system input state when a success result is measured and @xmath43 is the operator applied to the system on measuring the failure result .",
    "the particular form of the operators @xmath44 are not of concern as they are dependent on the apparatus being initialised in the @xmath39 state .",
    "they are included to include enough freedom to ensure that @xmath45 remains unitary . using the kronecker product representation of the tensor product",
    "the unitarity requirement can be written as @xmath46 which can be rewritten as @xmath47 provided @xmath42 and @xmath43 define a set of measurement operators ( in particular the requirement in equation ) then the first and last equations are always satisfied if @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". the second equation could never be satisfied had we swapped the success and failure operators in this assignment . if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are hermitian and commute , as is the case we are considering here , then we can always satisfy the second equation by choosing @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now we can substitute our success operator from equation   into this interaction unitary .",
    "this unitary can then be rearranged to be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 @xmath55 the operator @xmath53 is a pauli y - rotation of @xmath56 on the heralding qubit which depends on the number of bosons in the input mode .",
    "this unitary can be generated by the hamiltonian @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau } \\arcsin(\\min(1,g^{\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}-n } ) ) \\otimes \\hat{y},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the interaction time which is chosen to ensure the apropriate that the rotation parameter @xmath59 is implemented .      in the limit of low amplitude inputs",
    "we can implement the amplifier with @xmath16 .",
    "the system can then be considered a qubit and the gate between the system and the apparatus is locally equivalent to a standard controlled rotation . to see this , we take the unitary from equation  [ eq : ampunitary ] @xmath60 and then decompose it into @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the standard pauli matricies and @xmath64 is a controlled pauli @xmath65 rotation by @xmath59 and @xmath59 is as defined above with @xmath66 and @xmath16 . applying this unitary to states of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is small results in the probability of success for the noiseless amplification of @xmath69 .",
    "we can now calculate the performance of this model for particular situations .",
    "first we will calculate the action on coherent states .",
    "coherent states are an ideal test of the amplification process as the expected output from the amplification is easy to define .",
    "the ideal amplification action on a coherent state is @xmath70 this can then be used to calculate the probability of success and the fidelity of our model amplifier for coherent state inputs denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively ,    @xmath73,\\ ] ]    @xmath74    these expressions can be written in terms of incomplete gamma functions @xmath75 @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the regularlised incomplete gamma function defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the incomplete gamma function , @xmath80 is the complete gamma function and @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the incomplete gamma functions here is expected as this function is the cumulative distribution function for the possionian distribution which is the distribution that would result when measuring a coherent state in the fock basis . in this form",
    "these equations can be rapidly computed numerically for particular values of @xmath82 , @xmath68 and @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coherent0.8 ] shows @xmath71 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 .     for @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these curves are calculated from equations  [ eq : coherentprobability ] and  [ eq : coherentfidelity ] . ]",
    "the probability drops away from @xmath87 for small gains and the rate at which this occurs increases as @xmath15 increases .",
    "the fidelity initially stays close to @xmath87 for small amplitudes but eventually drops and the gain at which this occurs increases as @xmath15 increases . whilst these properties are evident in the figure , they are general features given that @xmath68 is fixed .",
    "low fidelity operation is not of great interest for building a device which performs linear amplification .",
    "therefore we will set a bound on performance that is deemed acceptable .",
    "quantitatively we will require a minimum fidelity @xmath88 .",
    "the fidelity will increase towards @xmath87 as @xmath15 increases hence in any particular situation we can choose an @xmath15 to achieve this fidelity requirement .",
    "figure  [ fig : graphscoherent ] shows the effect of enforcing this minimum acceptable fidelity .     for gains between @xmath89 and @xmath86 .",
    "cut - off @xmath15 is chosen to ensure an output fidelity more than @xmath90 .",
    "discontinuous jumps occur when the fidelity bound is reached and the value of @xmath15 is incremented .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath15 are shown in the lower plot . ]",
    "the most notable effect that can be seen is the discontinuous jumps in the probability of success .",
    "a jump occurs when the cut - off @xmath15 is incremented to enforce the minimum fidelity .",
    "this means that the probability of success is made up of pieces from the probabilities like what is shown in figure  [ fig : coherent0.8 ] for @xmath84 . also of note , is that for low amplitude inputs ( here @xmath91 ) then choosing @xmath16 provides an acceptable reproduction of linear amplification over a wide range of gain ( here @xmath92 ) .",
    "an important application of this type of amplification is distilling continuous variable entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the action of the amplifier is easiest to calculate for an ideal einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state @xmath93 where the parameter @xmath94 is representative of the strength of the continuous variable entanglement .",
    "the ideal amplification of this state is then @xmath95 the action of the amplifier preserves the form of the epr state but increases the entanglement .",
    "note that this places an upper bound on @xmath82 . for if @xmath96 then the coefficients in the summation diverge .",
    "what this means is that when an implementation chooses an @xmath15 cut - off , the output state does not converge towards a particular state in the limit as @xmath97 .",
    "this phenomenon will also found when applying ideal amplification to a distribution of coherent states which forms a mixed state  @xcite .",
    "the epr state can be generalised to include losses . here",
    "we will concentrate on the case where only one of the epr modes undergoes loss of amplitude @xmath98 .",
    "the state from this is a three mode state @xmath99 where the third mode represents the loss mode which is assumed to be inaccessible to any experiment .    as in the case of the pure epr state ,",
    "the lossy epr state under ideal amplification is another lossy epr state but with different parameters , see figure  [ fig : eprequiv ] . applying the ideal amplification to the second mode in equation  [ eq : eprloss ] introduces a @xmath100 into the coefficients . then equating this to another lossy epr state characterised by squeezing @xmath101 and transmission @xmath102 gives the relations @xmath103 which must hold true for all integers @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "two separate equations can be obtained from this , @xmath106 @xmath107 which can be inverted to give @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 the possibility of non - convergence of the output state , just as seen for pure epr inputs , is present here as well .",
    "convergence will be achieved provided @xmath111 .",
    "we will consider @xmath98 to be a fixed value and choose @xmath101 to be a fixed in the sense that some target squeezing strength is desired . in this way we can avoid choosing gains for which the output is not convergent .",
    "we will focus here on the ability of the state to demonstrate the epr paradox  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by epr criterion @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the conditional variance of the @xmath115 mode on @xmath116 and the superscript represents the quadrature in which the variance is calculated .",
    "the conditional variance is defined as @xmath117 and for the epr state with one sided loss the optimisation gives  @xcite @xmath118 and hence the epr criterion in this case is @xmath119 when the amplifier succeeds , both the effective squeezing and transmission are greater then their initial counterparts .",
    "the amplifier has a purifing action on this state .",
    "this means that it is possible to reach a lower epr criterion then would be otherwise possible .     and an initial transmission of @xmath120 .",
    "the red line indicates the initial epr criterion ( no amplification ) , while the green line represents the maximum epr criterion that could be obtained by using a squeezed state with @xmath121 without making use of a noiseless amplifier . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : eprideal ] shows the epr criterion for an output squeezing of @xmath122 with a channel transmission of @xmath123 .",
    "the lowest epr condition possible without amplification given the channel loss ( i.e. @xmath124 ) is achieved by amplifying the lossy epr state when @xmath125 .",
    "the state conditional on achieving success is    @xmath126    the probability of success for our model amplifier on this type of input state can be simply computed as @xmath127 just as before @xmath128 a sum can be removed from this equation by using the relationship @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the regularised incomplete beta function  @xcite , giving @xmath131 to compute fidelity is more difficult because when the loss mode is traced out the resulting state is mixed .",
    "we can calculate a lower bound on the fidelity by computing the fidelity of the amplified state compared to the purified lossy epr state with squeezing @xmath101 and loss @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136    where @xmath137 is defined in equation  [ eq : auxrelation ] .        the probability and fidelity for @xmath138 to @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : eprrealnla ] .",
    "the probabilities drop exponentially with gain , but the fidelity drops slowly .",
    "this is because as the gain increases a lower @xmath142 is used to ensure that @xmath101 stays fixed .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of these functions as @xmath143 is @xmath144 @xmath145 hence we find that the fidelity asymptotically approaches a constant value @xmath146 the fidelity will always be @xmath87 at @xmath147 and for larger @xmath82 then approaches this constant value from above .",
    "therefore this number constitutes a lower bound on the fidelity .",
    "as was indicated before in the analysis for coherent state inputs , the low fidelity operation is not usually of interest .",
    "when designing an experiment there is usually some minimum fidelity and probability of success that is deemed acceptable .",
    "the order of magnitude for these is dependant on the on the experimental conditions .",
    "we will now consider these factors to further analyse the action of this model amplifier .",
    "we can use this expression for the limiting case of fidelity to explicly compute a maximum @xmath15 under restrictions in the fidelity and entanglement .",
    "a fidelity minimum is chosen @xmath148 and at all times the performance of amplification must always be higher than this number . also , if there is a maximum @xmath111 for which amplifications can not exceed after successful amplification , then it must be true that @xmath149 note that this requirement is independent of the probability of success .    to consider both a probability and fidelity bound we consider a numerical optimisation of the epr criterion for an amplified epr state which results a particular output squeezing @xmath101 which has undergone one sided loss @xmath150 .",
    "the optimisation we will consider here enforces a fidelity greater than @xmath90 and the probability of success greater than either @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "because of the monotonic nature of the fidelity and probability under such conditions , we find that this optimisation always occurs on the boundary of either the probability constraint or the fidelity constraint . figure  [ fig : besteprcond ] shows the results of this optimisation when @xmath140 and @xmath154 as a function of loss .",
    "the results of this optimisation are best understood by starting at the case where @xmath155 .",
    "for this case we want to find if we are at the boundary of the fidelity or probability constraints whilst ensuring that both constraints are satisfied . also , the largest possible gain which achieves the fidelity constraint will occur at the lowest value for @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we seek the gain and lowest @xmath15 such that our fidelity and probability constraints are satisfied . as the loss",
    "is increased , less signal is amplified and the fidelity and probability increase . therefore a larger gain can be chosen which still satisfies the constraints .",
    "this continues until such point as the input signal is weak enough so that the next lowest @xmath15 satisfies the constraints .",
    "this results in a discontinuous jump in the output .",
    "also , if the probability was the saturated constraint , when @xmath15 is decremented this may change to the fidelity constraint being the one that is saturated .",
    "as loss is increased further there will be a point where the saturation of these constraints will swap .",
    "this results in sharp corners appearing in the maximised curves for the gain and epr criterion .",
    "the figures also show a comparison of this best epr criterion to particular situations not involving any amplification process .",
    "the amplification process always produces a lower epr criterion when compared with doing no amplification .",
    "however , it is probably of more interest to compare the situation to that of assuming the entanglement source could in principle produce a maximally entangled epr state ( i.e. @xmath156 ) . because of the loss , the epr criterion for this limiting case is not zero .",
    "our amplification model can succeed in producing a lower epr criterion than that of the maximally entanged source .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : besteprcond ] this improvement occurs in high loss situations .",
    "the parameters for which this improvement occurs will depend on the value of @xmath101 chosen .",
    "but as shown in figure  [ fig : besteprcond ] the range of losses for which this occurs can cover a significant range .",
    "this paper has demonstrated a new model which could be used as a noiseless phase insensitive linear amplifier .",
    "we have presented a unitary for the non - conditional evolution of a coupled harmonic oscillator system and a heralding qubit .",
    "this evolution can then be used as a probabilistic amplifier by measuring the heralding qubit after the unitary evolution .",
    "the evolution is not that of a linear optical transformation , but does achieve the highest theoretically possible probability of success . the action of our noiseless amplification model on a coherent state and an epr state was computed . for an epr state undergoing one sided loss",
    ", we found that for sufficiently high loss it is possible for the amplifier to achieve an epr criterion lower than that possible using an unamplified infinite squeezed source passing through the same loss . by choosing our parameters such that we target a particular level of two - mode squeezing when the amplification succeeds ,",
    "we have shown that , for the case of single sided loss , the fidelity of the amplification has a lower bound .",
    "this model and the results we have computed here may be used as a guide to future experiments which wish to operate near the optimal probability of success .",
    "this research was conducted by the australian research council centre of excellence for quantum computation and communication technology ( project number ce110001027 ) .",
    "we have used the definition of the incomplete gamma function as the integral @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath158 and @xmath159 notation we have used for the regularised incomplete gamma functions is widely used but not universally used . see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/regularizedgammafunction.html"
