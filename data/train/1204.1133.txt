    "many galaxies are observed to have moving extraplanar gas , generally termed as galactic superwinds ( see veilleux et al .",

    "the advent of x - ray astronomy established yet another phase of galactic outflows , namely the hot plasma , emitting x - rays in the temperature range @xmath8 kev ( strickland 2004 ) .",
    "also recent observations have revealed the existence of molecular gas in these outflows ( veilleux et al .",
    "2009 , walter 2002 ) .",
    "earlier observations were limited to local dwarf starburst galaxies that showed these winds . however , in recent years , the observations of outflows in ultra luminous infra - red galaxies ( uligs ) have extended the range of galaxies in which outflows are found ( martin 2005 , rupke et al .",
    "2005 , rupke et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there have been speculations on winds from starburst galaxies ( burke 1968 , mathews & baker 1971 , johnson & axford 1971 ) . in these models",
    "the large scale winds are a consequence of energy injection by multiple supernovae ( larson 1974 , chevalier & clegg 1985 , dekel & silk 1986 , heckman 2002 ) . in the context of the multiphase structure of the outflows , the results of these theoretical models are more relevant for the x - ray emitting hot wind . on the other hand ,",
    "observations of the cold outflows are better explaind by the radiation driving ( murray 2005 , martin 2005 ) .",
    "if only thompson scattering is considered , then radiation from galaxies does not seem to be a reasonable wind driving candidate because opacities would be small ; however one should consider that these winds are heavily enriched .",
    "murray et al .",
    "2005 proposed a wind driving mechanism based on the scattering of dust - grains by the photons from the galaxy ( see also chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 ; davies et al .",
    "this mechanism can be quite effective since the opacities in dust - photon scattering can be of the order of hundred @xmath9g@xmath6 and gas in turn , being coupled with the dust , is driven out of the galaxy if the galaxy posseses a certain critical luminosity .",
    "bianchi & ferrara ( 2005 ) argued that dust grains ejected from galaxies by radiation pressure can enrich the intergalactic medium .",
    "nath & silk ( 2009 ) then described a model of outflows with radiation and thermal pressure , in the context of outflows from lyman break galaxies observed by shapely ( 2005 ) .",
    "murray ( 2010 ) have also described a similar model in which radiation pressure is important for the first few million years of the starburst phase , after which sn heated hot gas pushes the outflowing material .",
    "sharma & nath ( 2011 ) have also shown that radiation pressure is important for outflows from high mass galaxies with a large sfr ( with @xmath10 km s@xmath6 , sfr @xmath11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath6 ) , particularly in uligs .    in this paper , we study the effect of radiation pressure in driving cold and/or warm gas outflows from disc galaxies with numerical simulations .",
    "recently , sharma ( 2011 ) calculated the terminal speed of such a flow along the pole of a disc galaxy , taking into account the gravity of disc , stellar bulge and dark matter halo .",
    "they determined the minimum luminosity ( or , equivalently , the maximum mass - to - light ratio of the disc ) to drive a wind , and also showed that the terminal speed lies in the range of @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the rotation speed of the disc galaxy ) , consistent with observations ( rupke 2005 , martin 2005 ) , and the ansatz used by numerical simulations in order to explain the metal enrichment of the igm ( oppenheimer 2006 ) .",
    "we investigate further the physical processes for a radiation driven wind .",
    "rotation is yet another aspect of the winds that we address in our simulation .",
    "as the wind material is lifted from a rotating disc , it should be rotating inherently which is seen in observations as well ( greve 2004 , westmoquette et al .",
    "2009 , sofue et al .",
    "1992 , seaquist & clark 2001 , walter et al . 2002 ) .",
    "previous simulations of galactic outflows have considered the driving force of a hot ism energized by the effects of supernovae ( kohji & ikeuchi 1988 ; tomisaka & bregman 1993 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; suchkov 1994 , 1996 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ; fragile 2004 ; cooper 2008 , fujita 2009 ) .",
    "however the detailed physics of a radiatively driven galactic outflow is yet to be studied with a simulation . in this work ,",
    "we study the dynamics of an irradiated gas above an axisymmetric disc galaxy by using hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "recently hopkins ( 2011 ) have explored the relative roles of radiation and supernovae heating in galactic outflows , and studied the feedback on the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "our goal here is different in the sense that we focus on the structure and dynamics , particularly the effect of rotation , of the wind . in order to disentangle the effects of various processes involved",
    ", we intentionally keep the physical model simple .",
    "for example , we begin with a constant density and surface brightness disk , then study the effect of a radial density and radiation profile , and finally introduce rotation of the disk , in order to understand the effect of each detail separately , instead of performing one single simulation with many details put together .",
    "the main driving force is radiation force and the containing force is due to gravity .",

    "recent analytical works ( sharma & nath 2011 ) and simulations ( hopkins 2011 ) have shown that outflows from massive galaxies ( @xmath132 m@xmath12 ) have different characteristics than those from low mass galaxies .",
    "outflows from massive galaxies are mostly driven by radiation pressure and the fraction of cold gas in the halos of massive galaxies is large ( van de voort & schaye 2011 ) . our simulations presented here addresses these outflows in particular .",
    "we have parameterized our simulation runs with the disc eddington factor @xmath54 , and it is important to know the corresponding luminosity for a typical disc galaxy , or the equivalent star formation rate . for a typical opacity of a dust and gas mixture ( @xmath133 @xmath9 g@xmath6 )",
    "( draine 2011 ) , the correspondig mass - to - light ratio requirement for @xmath130 is that @xmath134 .",
    "sharma ( 2011 ) showed that for the case of an instantaneous star formation , @xmath135 is possible for an initial period of @xmath136 myr after the starburst .",
    "however for a continuous star formation , which is more realistic for disc galaxies , sharma & nath ( 2011 ) found that only ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) , with star formation rate larger than @xmath137 m@xmath12 yr@xmath6 and which are also massive , are suitable candidates for such large values of @xmath54 , and for radiatively driven winds .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections show that the outflowing gas within the central region of a few kpc tends to stay close to the pole , and does not move outwards because of its low angular momentum .",
    "this makes the outflow somewhat collimated .",
    "although outflows driven by sn heated hot wind also produces a conical structure ( e.g. , fragile 2004 ) emanating from a breakout point of the sn remnants , there is a qualitative difference between this case and that of radiatively driven winds as presented in our simulations . while it is the pressure of the hot gas that expands gradually as it comes out of a stratified atmosphere , in the case of a radiation driven wind , it is the combination of mostly the lack of rotation and almost vertical radiation driving force in the central region that produce the collimation effect .",
    "we also note that the conical structure of rotation in the outflowing gas is similar to the case of outflow in m82 ( greve 2004 ) , where one observes a diverging and rotating periphery of conical outflow .",
    "we have not considered radiative cooling in our simulations , since for typical density in the wind the radiative cooling time is shorter or comparable than the dynamical time .",
    "however , there are regions of higher density close to the base and radiative cooling can be important there .",
    "we will address this point in a future paper .    from our results of the exponential and rotating disc model",
    ", we find the wind comprising of low - angular momentum gas lifted from the disc .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent simulations of supernovae driven winds have also claimed a similar result ( governato 2010 ) .",
    "such loss of low angular momentum gas from the disc may have important implication for the formation and evolution of the bulge , since the bulge population is deficient in stars with low specific angular momentum .",
    "binney , gerhardt & silk ( 2001 ) have speculated that outflows from disc that preferentially removes low angular momentum material may resolve some discrepancies between observed properties of disc and results of numerical simulations .    as a caveat",
    ", we should finally note that the scope and predictions of our simulation is limited by the simple model of disc radiation adoped here .",
    "in reality , radiation from disks is likely to be confined in the vicinity of star clusters , and not spread throughout the disk as we have assumed here .",
    "this is likely to increase the efficacy of radiation pressure , but which is not possible within the scope of an axisymmetric simulation .",
    "we have presented the results of hydrodynamical ( eulerian ) simulations of radiation driven winds from disc galaxies . after studying the cases of winds from a constant surface density disc and exponential disc without rotation , we have studied a rotating outflow originating from an exponential disc with rotation .",
    "we find that the outflow speed increases rapidly with the disc eddington parameter @xmath138 for @xmath4 , consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "the density structure of the outflow has a conical appearance , and most of the ouflowing gas consists of low angular momentum gas .",
