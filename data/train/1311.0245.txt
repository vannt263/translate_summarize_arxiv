    "in this paper we study a class of pseudodifferential operators , given in terms of a smooth distribution @xmath0 of subspaces of constant rank @xmath1 of the tangent space .",
    "the resulting class will be an algebra of pseudolocal operators , that is geometrically invariant .",
    "it will consist of a 2-parameter family @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 contains the standard ` isotropic ' algebra of pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath4 , and @xmath5 contains the ` non - isotropic ' pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath6 .",
    "thus we think of our algebra as one that has mixed homogeneities , and understanding our algebra sheds light on how ` isotropic ' pseudodifferential operators compose with ` non - isotropic ' pseudodifferential operators that are related to sub - elliptic estimates and several complex variables .",
    "the results are first stated on @xmath7 , where the formulation is the cleanest .",
    "we will then adapt the results to the setting of smooth manifolds , and show that many natural operators in the context of strongly pseudoconvex domains are contained in our algebra .",
    "there has been a lot of work on pseudodifferential operators that are ` non - isotropic ' , especially in the context of subelliptic analysis and several complex variables ; see e.g. work of nagel - stein @xcite , phong - stein @xcite , taylor @xcite , beals - greiner @xcite and ponge @xcite for some antecedents of our results .",
    "those in turn can be traced back to some earlier work on ` non - isotropic ' singular integrals related to sub - elliptic estimates , which can be found in e.g. folland - stein @xcite , rothschild - stein @xcite . for a general treatment of relevant topics on singular integrals ,",
    "see street @xcite .    our class of operators of order @xmath8 form a subalgebra of the algebra of flag kernels , as was investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite by mller , nagel , ricci , stein and wainger , and in @xcite by gowacki .",
    "in fact , say on the heisenberg group @xmath9 , there are two classes of flag kernels , adapted to the flags @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the intersection of these two algebras of flag kernels gives rise to an algebra of pseudolocal operators ; c.f .",
    "nagel - ricci - stein - wainger @xcite . our algebra @xmath2 , when @xmath12 , is then a variable coefficient version of this algebra of pseudolocal singular integrals . in this way , @xcite was the starting point to our present work .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , given a distribution @xmath0 on @xmath7 , and two real numbers @xmath13 , we will define a class of symbols @xmath14 of order @xmath15 , and associate to it a class of pseudodifferential operators @xmath2 .",
    "operators in such classes can be composed , so that the composition of an operator of order @xmath16 with one of order @xmath17 is an operator of order @xmath15 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 is closed under taking adjoints , and enjoys a diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "in addition , while the operators associated to @xmath20 fail to be weak - type @xmath21 , they will preserve @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand , for any @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 form two particularly significant ideals of @xmath27 : they map @xmath28 to weak-@xmath28 , and preserve the isotropic and non - isotropic lipschitz spaces of any positive order .",
    "we have also a rather surprising fractional integration result on @xmath22 , @xmath29 , for operators of order @xmath15 , when both @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; it is stronger than the one predicted by the composition of an operator of order @xmath32 with one of order @xmath33 .",
    "the same class of operators also map @xmath28 into weak @xmath34 for the best possible exponent @xmath35 , if in addition @xmath36 .",
    "many of these results depend on a characterization of the kernels of operators of class @xmath2 , in terms of differential inequalities and cancellation conditions , that are of interest in their own right .",
    "we then apply our results to the szeg projection , as well as the caldern operator , on the boundary of smoothly bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains in @xmath37 .    the full proofs of many of the results stated below are rather lengthy , so only sketchy indications of the main ideas are given here .",
    "the details , as well as some further extensions , will appear elsewhere .",
    "it is to be emphasized that our results are valid for distributions @xmath0 where no curvature assumptions are required . for simplicity of exposition ,",
    "we limit ourselves below to the case of distributions of tangent subspaces of codimension 1 ; the results hold more generally for distributions of tangent subspaces of higher codimension .",
    "suppose we are given a smooth distribution @xmath0 of tangent subspaces in @xmath7 .",
    "assume @xmath0 is of codimension 1 , and is given by the nullspace of a 1-form whose coefficients have uniformly bounded derivatives .",
    "then there exists a global frame @xmath38 of tangent vectors on @xmath7 , such that the first @xmath39 vectors form a basis of @xmath0 at every point .",
    "furthermore , one can pick @xmath40 such that all coefficients @xmath41 are @xmath42 functions , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 below we will fix such a frame @xmath45 , and use that to construct our class of symbols .",
    "it is to be pointed out , however , that our symbol class will ultimately depend only on the distribution @xmath0 , and not on the particular choice of @xmath45 .",
    "we will often need the coefficients of the inverse of the matrix @xmath46 ; let s denote that inverse by @xmath47 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath48      one can define a variable coefficient linear map on the cotangent spaces , namely @xmath51 so that @xmath52 then @xmath49 restricts to a map @xmath53 in fact , @xmath49 maps the dual frame @xmath54 of @xmath55 to the frame @xmath56 .",
    "one can also define a variable coefficient linear map on the tangent spaces , namely @xmath57 so that @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 denotes the inverse transpose of a linear map @xmath60 . ) more explicitly , @xmath61 it follows that @xmath50 restricts to a map @xmath62      we need a variable seminorm on the cotangent bundle of @xmath7 , defined by @xmath63 ( note only the first @xmath39 components of @xmath64 are involved . ) in addition , we write @xmath65 which we think of as the euclidean norm of @xmath66 .",
    "it is useful to consider the map @xmath67 given formally by @xmath68 more precisely , the @xmath69-th component of @xmath70 is given by @xmath71    for each @xmath72 , in addition to the euclidean distance @xmath73 , we can now define a quasi - distance @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 this has the following properties : @xmath76 and @xmath77 also ,    a.   @xmath78 for all @xmath72 , and b.   @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "this quasi - distance , together with the lebesgue measure on @xmath7 , gives @xmath7 the structure of a space of homogeneous type .",
    "suppose now @xmath82 , for some @xmath83 , is a tubular neighborhood of the diagonal of @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is a @xmath42 map @xmath86 with @xmath87 we write @xmath88 and assume in addition the existence of some absolute constant @xmath89 such that @xmath90 given such a map @xmath85 , we say that it is * compatible * with our distribution @xmath0 , if and only if @xmath91    equivalently , it is compatible with @xmath0 , if the map @xmath92 @xmath93 restricts to a map @xmath94 for all @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath81 defined in section  [ subsect : quasidistance ] is an example of such @xmath85 .    in applications",
    ", we will often work locally , and be given a distribution @xmath0 of tangent subspaces on an euclidean ball @xmath96 , say @xmath97 .",

    "we can now define the symbols of mixed homogeneity . we will fix a distribution @xmath0 of tangent subspaces of @xmath7 , and fix a frame of tangent vectors @xmath55 on @xmath7 that satisfies the conditions laid out in section  [ sect : prelim ] .",

    "we say in this case the change of coordinate is * admissible*. one can show that our symbol class is invariant under admissible changes of coordinates .",

    "first , given @xmath161 , we take @xmath159 to be the class of all smooth functions @xmath162 on the cotangent bundle of @xmath7 such that @xmath163 this class is sometimes also called the * ` isotropic ' symbols * ( or * classical symbols * of type @xmath164 ) of order @xmath4 . it is defined independent of the distribution @xmath0 .",
