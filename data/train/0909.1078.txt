    "<S> using simple stellar population synthesis , we model the bulge stellar contribution in the optical spectrum of a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy re j1034 + 396 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that its bulge stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath0 ^-1 km s@xmath1  . the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass is about @xmath2 if it follows the well - known @xmath3 relation found in quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the smbh mass from the h@xmath4 second moment , which is consistent with that from its bulge stellar velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the smbh mass of @xmath2 implies that the x - ray quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) of re j1034 + 396 can be scaled to a high - frequency qpo at 27 - 108 hz found in galactic black hole binaries with a 10 @xmath5 black hole . with the mass distribution in different age stellar populations , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) over past 0.1 gyr is @xmath6 @xmath7 , the stellar mass in the logarithm is @xmath8 in units of solar mass , and the current star formation rate is @xmath9 . re j1034 + 396 does not follow the relation between the eddington ratio and the ssfr suggested by chen et al . , although a larger scatter in their relation . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that about 7.0% of the total hh@xmath10  luminosity and 50% of the total [ o ii ]  luminosity come from the star formation process .    </S>",
