    "there are plenty of evidences for the presence of a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) associated with the galactic center sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) .",
    "the angular size of its schwarzschild radius ( @xmath1 ) is the largest among known black hole candidates @xmath2due to its proximity ( @xmath3 kpc , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing an unprecedented opportunity to probe the environment around the smbh .",
    "the very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) can achive a spatial resolution within 100 @xmath4 . though detailed imaging of its structure has suffered from the effect of interstellar scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its intrinsic structure start appearing at wavelength shorter than @xmath51 cm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the intrinsic size of sgr a * measured by mm - vlbi observations has a wavelength - dependence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , interpreted to originate in stratified wavelength - dependent photosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , variations of its intrinsic size are detected at 7 mm @xcite    the flux of sgr a * is known to be variable at radio , nir and x - ray bands on various time - scales from intra - day to a few months .",
    "the radio band variability on time scales longer than a day could be explained by both an intrinsic origin and interstellar scintillation .",
    "however , recent studies show that the flux variability at short cm / mm wavelengths can not be explained by a simple model of interstellar scattering but is likely to be intrinsic @xcite .",
    "monitoring of sgr a * with vlbi is of great importance to investigate relation between variations in the radio flux and size at the vicinity of its smbh , and probe a possible mechanism of its variability . to do this",
    ", we performed multi - epoch observations of sgr a * with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) .",
    "]    we performed multi - epoch observations of sgr a * at 7 mm ( i.e. 43 ghz ) from 2004 to 2008 @xcite .",
    "we detected quiescent flux levels and no radio flares ( see , figure [ fig : ka2013 ] ) .",
    "however , comparisons with previous very long baseline array ( vlba ) results showed that sgr a * underwent a flaring event for at least 10 days in 2007 may reported in @xcite .",
    "our data show that the intrinsic size of sgr a * remained ( within errors ) unchanged compared to the size before and after the flaring event , indicating that the brightness temperature of sgr a * was increased . the duration of this flaring event is less than 31 days , which is shorter than the refractive time scale of 3 months @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to explain the increase in the spectral index at this flaring event reported in @xcite by a simple interstellar scattering model @xcite .",
    "hence , the flaring event is most likely associated with changes in the intrinsic properties of sgr a*.    considering observed structure , it is unlikely that the flaring event is associated with an ejection of relativistic component or a temporal one - shot plasma heating such as an expanding plasma blob ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a hot spot orbiting around the central black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the flaring event is likely to be associated with a brightness increase of the photosphere . since the synchrotron cooling time - scale at mm wavelengths is much shorter than than the duration of the flare , understanding the flare requires a mechanism that heats electrons continuously on timescales much longer than the orbital timescales of the accretion disk such as a standing shock in an accretion flow . in the future ,",
    "simultaneous multi - frequency flux monitoring from cm to sub - mm wavelengths would be helpful to constrain the properties of electron distribution at the flaring event .",
    "recently , the gas cloud g2 with three earth masses has been detected on its way to sgr a * @xcite .",
    "g2 will approach pericenter at a distance of only 1500 - 2200 @xmath4 ( 15 - 22 mas ) in early-2014 @xcite .",
    "the dynamic evolution around sgr a * in the next few years will be an unique probe for understanding the properties of the accretion flow / jet and the feeding processes of the smbh .    related with the g2 encounter with sgr a * , two flaring phenomena are expected in radio regime as of november 2013 .",
    "first , g2 is expected to trigger flaring of sgr a * , since the radio flux is strongly related to the mass accretion rate @xmath6 to the central black hole , scaling with @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the accretion flow and @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the jet .",
    "a possible increase in the mass accretion rate would cause a flux increase as well as structural changes in the visible structure detectable with vlbi , like an increase in the size of the radio emitting region ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or appearance of the visible jet .",
    "second , @xcite predict that the interaction between g2 and the accretion disk will produce a bow - shock luminous in radio regime around pericenter .",
    "vlbi observations would be important for constraining the size and the compact feature of the shock region .",
    "we are going to continue monitoring with newly developed kvn and vera array ( kava ) .",
    "kava consists of 7 stations in korean vlbi network ( kvn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and vera ( see , figure [ fig : kava ] ) , and will start regular observations at 13/7 mm ( i.e. 22/43 ghz ) from march 2014 .",
    "kava is expected to achieve a good performance for sgr a * observations , since it has more short baselines than other vlbi arrays .",
    "one of reasons making it difficult to calibrate vlbi data of sgr a * is its low correlated flux density in long baselines owing to the effect of the interstellar scattering .",
    "short ( @xmath9 km ) baselines in kava provide more effective sampling of the visibilities of sgr a * than vlba ( figure [ fig : kava ] ) , enabling accurate determination of its size and good - quality images similar to or better than vlba .",
    "our future observations will provide more detailed information about mas - scale structure of sgr a * around the most important period of the g2 encounter .",
