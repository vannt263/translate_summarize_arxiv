    "conjunction fallacy was first empirically documented by tversky and kahneman ( 1982 , 1983 ) through a now renowned experiment in which subjects are presented with a description of someone called  linda \" :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  linda is 31 years old , single , outspoken , and very bright .",
    "she majored in philosophy . as a student , she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice , and also participated in anti - nuclear demonstrations . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "then , subjects are shown a list of 8 possible outcomes describing her present employment and activities , and are asked to rank the propositions by representativeness or probability .",
    "two items were specifically tested :    *  linda is a bank teller \" , *  linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement \" .",
    "empirical results show that most people judge ( 2 ) more probable than ( 1 ) . in the framework of classical probabilities , this is a fallacy  the conjunction fallacy , since a conjunction can not be more probable than one of its components .",
    "if linda being active in the feminist movement is denoted by @xmath0 and linda being a bank teller by @xmath1 , then @xmath2 should classically prevail .",
    "the conjunction fallacy has been shown to be particularly robust under various variations of the initial experimental protocol ( cf . tversky and kahneman 1982 , 1983 , gigerenzer 1996 , kahneman and tversky 1996 , hertwig 1997 , hertwig and chase 1998 , hertwig and gigerenzer 1999 , mellers et al .",

    "2004 , tentori et al .",
    "2004 , hertwig et al . 2008 , moro 2009 , kahneman 2011 , erceg and galic 2014 ; for a review , cf .",
    "moro 2009 ) .",
    "it has been observed in other cases than the linda story , about topics like sports , politics , or natural events , and in scenarios in which the propositions to be ranked are not preceded with a description .",
    "the fallacy also persists when the experimental setting is changed , e.g. in  between subjects \" experiments in which ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are presented to different subjects only .",
    "semantic and syntactic aspects have also been discussed , in relation with possible misunderstandings , like the implicit meaning of the words  probability \" and  and \" .",
    "careful experiments show that the conjunction fallacy persists .",
    "the conjunction fallacy questions the fact that classical probability theory can be used to describe human judgment and decision making , and it can also be viewed as a challenge to the definition of what a rational judgment is .",
    "thus , it is no surprise that the conjunction fallacy has been the subject of a big amount of research ( tentori and crupi 2012 give the number of a hundred papers devoted to it ) .",
    "it has interested psychologists , economists and philosophers alike .",
    "for instance , behavioral economists have looked at the consequences of the fallacy for understanding real life economic behavior , measuring the robustness of this bias in an economic context with incentives or in betting situations ( e.g. charness et al .",
    "2010 , nilsson and anderson 2010 , erceg and galic 2014 ) .",
    "they have also investigated whether the cognitive abilities of subjects are related to behavioral biases in general ( and to the conjunction fallacy in particular , cf .",
    "oechssler et al . 2009 ) , and this has led to stimulating research with applications in finance .",
    "epistemologists have made confirmation and bayesianism enter the debate ( e.g. tentori and crupi 2008 and 2012 , hartmann and meijs 2012 , schupbach 2012 , shogenji 2012 ) .",
    "given that a conjunction fallacy occurs under robust experimental conditions , a natural question arises : how can this fallacy be explained ?",
    "several accounts have been argued for , but no one has reached an uncontroversial status today ( as noted by fisk 2004 , nilsson et al 2009 , jarvstad and hahn 2011 , tentori et al .",
    "first , tversky and kahneman originally suggested that a representativeness heuristic ( i.e. the probability that linda is a feminist is evaluated from the degree with which the instance of linda corresponds to the general category of feminists ) could account for some conjunction fallacy cases .",
    "but it has been argued that the representativeness concept involved is informal and ill - specified ( gigerenzer 1996 , birnbaum et al 1990 ) , and suggestions to specify it in the technical sense of a likelihood value ( shafir et al 1990 , massaro 1994 ) account for limited cases only ( crupi et al .",
    "according to another suggestion , agents actually evaluate the probability of the conjunction from some combination of the probabilities of the components , like averaging or adding ( fantino et al .",
    "1997 , nilsson et al .",
    "however , such explanations do not resist empirical tests , as tentori et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have argued .",
    "the latter propose an account of the conjunction fallacy based on the notion of inductive confirmation as defined in bayesian theory , and give experimental grounds for it ",
    "it is one of the currently promising accounts .",
    "others have argued , also within a bayesian framework , that there are cases in which the conjunction fallacy is actually not a fallacy and can be accounted for rationally ( hintikka 2004 , von sydow 2011 , hartmann and meijs 2012 ) .",
    "finally , another prominent proposal to account for the conjunction fallacy , on which we focus here , makes uses of so - called  quantum - like \" models , which rely on the mathematics of a major contemporary physical theory , quantum mechanics ( franco 2009 , busemeyer et al .",
    "2011 , yukalov and sornette 2011 , pothos and busemeyer 2013)note that only mathematical tools of quantum mechanics are exploited , and that the models are not justified by an application of quantum physics to the brain .",
    "the quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy is particularly promising as it belongs to a more general theoretical framework of quantum - like modeling in cognition and decision making , which has been applied to many fallacies or human behavior considered as irrational ( for reviews , see pothos and busemeyer 2013 , ashtiani and azgomi 2015 , or bruza et al .",
    "2015 ; textbooks include busemeyer and bruza 2012 , haven and khrennikov 2013 ) . for instance",
    ", quantum - like models of judgments have been proposed to account for order effect , i. e. when the answers given to two questions depend on the order of presentation of these questions ( atmanspacher and rmer 2012 , busemeyer and bruza 2012 , wang and busemeyer 2013 , wang et al .",
    "2014 ) ; for the violation of the sure thing principle , which states that if an agent prefers choosing action a to b under a specific state of the world and also prefers choosing a to b in the complementary state , then she should choose a over b regardless of the state of the world ( busemeyer et al .",

    "new theoretical frameworks with quantum - like models have been offered in decision theory and bounded rationality ( danilov and lambert - mogiliansky 2008 and 2010 , lambert - mogiliansky et al .",
    "2009 , yukalov and sornette 2011 ) .    as the quantum - like account of",
    "the conjunction fallacy is one of the few promising accounts of the conjunction fallacy that are discussed today , we choose to focus on it in this paper . more specifically , we focus on the class of quantum - like models which are presented or defended in franco ( 2009 ) , busemeyer et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , busemeyer and bruza ( 2012 ) , pothos and busemeyer ( 2013 ) and busemeyer et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . in these models ,",
    "an agent s belief is represented by a quantum state  and not for instance by a measurement context .",
    "our aim is to assess the empirical adequacy of these quantum - like models that are used to account for the conjunction fallacy .",
    "we think that two points deserve particular scrutiny .",
    "first , it is not always clear which version of the models are supposed to account for particular cases of conjunction fallacies  are the simplest ones , called non - degenerate , sufficient ? or are the more general ones , called degenerate , needed ?",
    "more recent works tend to favor degenerate models over non - degenerate ones , and non - degenerate models have received some recent criticisms ( cf . tentori and crupi 2013 and pothos and busemeyer 2013 , p. 315 - 316 ) , but a clear and definitive argument on the matter would be welcome .",
    "second , the models have not yet been much tested on other predictions than the ones they were intended to account for .",
    "it should be checked that they are not _ ad hoc _ by testing their empirical adequacy in general .",
    "it is understandable that these two points have not been tested beforehand , as a new general pattern of explanation for the conjunction fallacy is hard to come up with .",
    "but since the models have come to be seen as one of the most promising accounts , it becomes urgent to assess them empirically more thoroughly  this is our goal in this paper .    as for the first point  discriminate between non - degenerate and degenerate models , we follow a suggestion made by boyer - kassem et al .",
    "( 2016 ) to test so - called  gr equations \" , that are empirical predictions made by non - degenerate models .",
    "such a gr test requires a new kind of experiment : not the original linda experiment , in which agents have to rank propositions , but an order effect experiment , in which two yes - no questions are asked in one order or in the other , to different agents .",
    "existing data can not answer the question of whether the gr equations are verified , as was already noted in 2009 by franco :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  there are no experimental data on order effects in conjunction fallacy experiments , when the judgments are performed in different orders",
    ". such an experiment could be helpful to better understand the possible judgment strategies . \"",
    "( franco 2009 , 421 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we fill this gap here by running several order effect experiments that collect the needed data . as for the second point ",
    "test new empirical predictions of the models , we consider two tests that apply to any version of the quantum - like models , whether degenerate or not , that are used in the account of the conjunction fallacy .",
    "it is well - known in the literature that quantum - like models that account for the conjunction fallacy predict an order effect for the two questions associated with the conjunction (  is linda a bank teller ? \" and  is linda a feminist ? \" ) .",
    "actually , this predicted order effect is not a side effect of the quantum - like models , but a core feature of them : they can not account for the conjunction fallacy without it .",
    "this enables a direct test of the quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy , that we apply to our collected experimental data .",
    "also , it has been shown that any quantum - like model of the kind involved in the account of the conjunction fallacy must make an empirical prediction called the",
    " qq equality \" ( wang and busemeyer 2013 , wang et al .",
    "we thus test whether the qq equality is verified",
    ". the failure of any of these last two tests will be enough to refute the current quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy . here also , the needed data is not available in the literature , but can be conveniently obtained from the same above - mentioned new experimental configuration , with two yes - no questions in both order . note that our methodology is novel : we are not testing the quantum - like models against data produced by traditional conjunction fallacy experiments that the model were designed to explain , but we are testing them against other data , in a new experimental framework on which the models actually make some predictions , and it is why the experimental situation we shall consider is different from the usual linda experiment .",
    "our experiment instantiates the mechanism that the quantum - like account claims agents follow : to evaluate a conjunction like  feminist and bank teller \" , agents are supposed to evaluate one characteristic after another , answering for themselves to two yes - no questions (  is linda a feminist ? \" ,  is linda a bank teller ? \" ) . in other words , the experiment we run somehow forces",
    "agents to follow the purported quantum - like mechanism .    to have more powerful tests , we have conducted several experiments , with variations of the scenario ( linda , but also others known as bill , mr",
    ". f. and k. ) , of the protocol ( questionnaires or computer - assisted experiment ) and with or without monetary incentives .",
    "the results we obtain show that current quantum - like models are not able to account for the conjunction fallacy .",

    "a general quantum - like model is introduced .",
    "section  3 presents the three empirical tests that will be performed : the gr equations , order effect , and the qq equality .",

    "section  6 presents the statistical analysis , and section  7 discusses the scope of the results and the future of the research on the conjunction fallacy account .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , we focus in this paper on a family of quantum - like models based on similar hypotheses that have recently been proposed to account for the conjunction fallacy .",

    ", we choose here to summarize them with a single model with our own notations , and the correspondence with the various models from the literature can easily be made by the reader .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we shall consider the conjunction fallacy through the linda case , but the generalization to other instances of the conjunction fallacy are straightforward .    according to this literature , after reading linda s description , the subject who has to choose the more likely proposition between    *  linda is a bank teller \" , *  linda is a feminist and a bank teller \"",
    ".    has the following mental process . to compare the propositions",
    ", she evaluates each one in terms of a yes - no question :    *  is linda a bank teller ? \" , *  is linda a feminist and a bank teller ? \" .",
    "an important hypothesis of the quantum - like models is that , when the subject considers ( @xmath3 ) , she actually answers for herself successively two simple yes - no questions :    *  is linda a feminist ? \" , *  is linda a bank teller ? \" .",
    "yes \" to @xmath3",
    "amounts to answering ",
    "yes \" to both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "also , the hypothesis is made that the more probable outcome ( bank teller or feminist ) is evaluated first .",

    "@xmath5 ( p. 418 ) .",
    "anyway , the tests we consider in the forthcoming sections do not depend on this hypothesis . ]",
    "let us now turn to the quantum - like framework that enable the quantitative prediction of the conjunction fallacy , @xmath6 .      for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "the non - degenerate versions of the quantum - like models are presented first , and the degenerate versions afterwards .",
    "the belief states of agents are represented within a vector space . in the simple case where",

    "predictions made by the quantum - like models are probabilistic .",
    "when a question @xmath22 ( @xmath23 = @xmath1 or @xmath0 ) is asked , the probability that the agent answers @xmath24 ( ) is given by the squared modulus of the scalar product between the belief state and the vector representing the answer : @xmath25 this rule is usually called the born rule , in analogy with the quantum mechanics denomination .",

    "this conveys the fact that the agent s beliefs are not externally influenced .",
    "this hypothesis is supposed to be relevant for cases in which the questions are posed to the agent relatively quickly .",
    "second , when the agent answers a question @xmath5 or @xmath4 , her state of belief changes .",
    "if her answer to question @xmath22 is @xmath24 , then her new state of belief just after giving the answer is : @xmath33 as the fraction in eq .",
    "[ eq_projection - postulate ] is a complex number , the state of belief after an answer @xmath24 is proportional to the vector @xmath27 representing this answer . in the case of a real hilbert space like on figure  [ fig_bases - b - and - f ] , after answering  yes \" to question @xmath5 , @xmath17 becomes either @xmath9 or @xmath34 , whatever the state of belief before the question .",
    "in other words , after a question @xmath23 has been posed , the state of belief is bound to be along the basis vectors representing its answers .",
    ".

    "hence , the above rule is often called the projection postulate .    because of the projection postulate , the states before and after an answer are in general different .",
    "they are the same only if the state previous to the answer is proportional to one of the basis vectors representing the possible answers to the question , i. e. when @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a complex number such that @xmath39 ( in the real case , @xmath40 ) . in such a case , the agent answers @xmath28 to question @xmath23 with probability 1 , and eq .",
    "[ eq_projection - postulate ] states that @xmath41 the fact that the state of belief changes when a question is answered is a real departure from the classical viewpoint .",
    "classically , the answer is supposed to _ reveal _ a belief , which is pre - existent to the question , and is the same before and after . however , the quantum - like models predict that once a question has been answered , the same answer will be given if the same question is posed again just after .",
    "let us now turn to the more general versions of these models , the degenerate ones .",

    "this section presents the three empirical predictions of the above quantum - like model that we will test .",
    "the first one applies to non - degenerate models , while the others apply to non - degenerate and degenerate models .",
    "following boyer - kassem et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , some specific empirical predictions can be derived for non - degenerate models , i.e. in which the answers are represented by subspaces of dimension  1 .",
    "it can be shown that a well - known law from quantum mechanics , the law of reciprocity , holds .",
    "consider the two questions @xmath4 and @xmath5 in one order or in the other .",
    "the law of reciprocity states that , for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 this law asserts that conditional probabilities of an answer given another answer are the same whatever the order of the questions @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that this law is typically quantum : it is not true in general for a classical model , in which @xmath58 , and thus @xmath59 as soon as @xmath60 .",
    "the law of reciprocity can be instantiated in the following ways :    [ eq_pb0a0=pa0b0 ] p(b_y|f_y ) = p(f_y|b_y ) , + [ eq_pb1a0=pa0b1 ] p(b_n|f_y ) = p(f_y|b_n ) , + [ eq_pb0a1=pa1b0 ] p(b_y|f_n ) = p(f_n|b_y ) , + [ eq_pb1a1=pa1b1 ] p(b_n|f_n ) = p(f_n|b_n ) .",

    "[ eq_mix0011 ] and [ eq_mix1001 ] are equivalent to one another and to the law of reciprocity itself .",

    "the non - degenerate quantum - like model presented in section  [ subsec_ql - models ] actually leaves very little freedom to conditional probabilities .",
    "the fact that the conditional probabilities are constrained by the gr equations had not been noticed beforehand for quantum - like models for the conjunction fallacy .",
    "note that these empirical predictions are _ consequences _ of the quantum - like models that are used to explain the conjunction fallacy in the linda experiment , and that these consequences are observable in experimental situations  @xmath63 and @xmath64 situations  that are _ not _ the ones of the original linda experiment .",
    "in other words , the gr equations show that a non - degenerate quantum - like model that is used to explain a linda experiment can be further tested on another kind of experiment .",
    "we shall come back on this point in section  [ sec_expdesign ] .",
    "the interpretation of the conditional probabilities is clear : they have been defined as the probability of some answer to a second question given the answer to a first question .",
    "this is straightforwardly consistent with the models presented in section  [ sec_ql - models ] , and in accordance with classical order effect experiments .",
    "another interpretation of the conditional probabilities could be that of an answer given some new piece of evidence , but this is not what is considered in this paper .",
    "quantum - like models of section  [ subsec_ql - models ] can predict an order effect , that is , predict that agents give different answers to the question @xmath4 followed by question @xmath5 , and to the question @xmath5 followed by question @xmath4 ( cf .",

    "if she answers  yes \" , the state vector is projected onto the plane @xmath77 .",
    "the probability of such an answer is given by the squared modulus of the length of this projection , namely @xmath78 ( remember that the basis vectors are orthogonal ) .",
    "this quantity is at least larger than @xmath76 , so a conjunction fallacy can not occur . to sum up ,",
    "any quantum - like model of the kind considered in section  2 which claims to account for the conjunction fallacy , be it non - degenerate or degenerate , has to display an order effect on the corresponding questions .",
    "this provides our second test ( cf .",
    "section  [ statanalysis ] for a discussion of the mathematical expression of the test ) .",
    "the proponents themselves of the quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy consider that the use of incompatible concepts ( or questions ) is the key feature of their model .",
    "as incompatible questions straightforwardly imply an order effect , our order effect test is actually a direct test of the core feature of the quantum - like account . and",
    "@xmath5 are compatible or incompatible .",
    "but the easiest way to do so is actually to test the order effect on these two questions . ] as for the gr equations , note that the order effect is here understood as an experimental situation with two successive yes - no questions , posed in one order or in the other after a text has been read , and that no new piece of evidence is provided between the two questions .",
    "to sum up , three features are essential for the quantum - like models under study to account for the conjunction fallacy : the born rule ( eq .  [ eq_born - rule ] ) , the projection postulate ( eq .  [ eq_projection - postulate ] ) , and the presence of incompatible questions entailing order effects .",
    "the quantum - like models of section  2 , whether degenerate or not , have recently been shown to entail new testable empirical predictions ( wang and busemeyer 2013 ) : a  quantum question \" ( qq ) equality .",
    "noting @xmath79 the probability of answering first @xmath28 to question @xmath22 _ and then _",
    "@xmath71 to question @xmath80 ( this is a joint probability , not a conditional probability ) , the qq equality reads : @xmath81    this equality is of prime importance . as busemeyer et al .",
    "( 2015 , 241 ) put it ,  it is an a priori , _ precise _ , _ quantitative _ , and _",
    "parameter - free _ prediction about the pattern of order effects \" .",
    "it has served as a test of the quantum - like models that claim to account for order effect .",
    "it turns out that  it has been statistically supported across a wide range of 70 national field experiments ( containing 651 to 3,006 nationally representative participants per field experiment ) that examined question - order effects ( wang et al . , 2014 ) \"",
    "( _ ibid . _ ) .",
    "similarly , the qq equality can be empirically tested in the case of the quantum - like models that account for the conjunction fallacy , as the models are the same .",
    "this constitutes our third test ( further statistical details about the test are given in section  6 ) .",
    "the three tests presented in the previous section ( gr equations , order effect , qq equality ) require to carry out an order effect experiment that shows the description of linda and then asks the questions @xmath4 and @xmath5 in both orders , ( @xmath62 ) or @xmath63 .",
    "the former order somehow forces the agent to follow the cognitive process supposed by the quantum - like models when evaluating a conjunction .",
    "we propose here its first experimental realization , in order to test the quantum - like models of section  2 .",
    "the order effect experiment we are considering here is different from the original conjunction fallacy experiment .",
    "if we want to claim that it tests anyway the quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy , do we need to make some extra hypothesis ?",
    "for instance , do we need to suppose that the quantum - like model for the conjunction fallacy also applies to another kind of experiment ? or do we need to assume that forcing an agent to explicitly answer the two questions will give the same results as when she answers them for herself ?",
    "we need not , because these assumptions are already made in the papers we are considering .",
    "first , the simple fact that the quantum - like account of the conjunction fallacy relies on  models \" that have a general and universal form and not only on _ ad hoc _ rules that apply to a limited number of situations , allows anyone to use these models _ ad libitum _ in any experimental situation that the model may represent .",
    "the order effect situation , in which two questions are asked , clearly falls within that range .",
    "so , we are allowed to apply ( and thus to test ) the quantum - like models of the conjunction fallacy in an order effect experiment .",
    "this amounts to testing experimental predictions of the models that they make because they have a general form . as the proponents of the models write :  the basic quantum model underpinning the conjunction fallacy [ ... ] makes new _ a priori _ predictions .",
    "foremost among them is the consequence that incompatible judgments and decisions must entail order effects . \"",
    "( bruza et al .",
    "2015 , p. 388 ) .",
    "( recall that incompatible judgments are required in the quantum - like model of the conjunction fallacy . ) in other words , the conjunction fallacy model entails order effects , and thus can be tested on them .",
    "this is all the more true than the authors actually claim that the quantum - like models used for the conjunction fallacy are the same as those used to explain other fallacies or phenomena , like order effect itself or similarity judgments .",
    "all models belong to a family that are often called a  theory \" of quantum cognition , and they are meant to make predictions on a wide range of phenomena , in diverse experimental situations  and the authors rightly claim that this is a strength of their approach .",
    "this supports the generality of the quantum - like models used for the conjunction fallacy .",
    "thus , it is legitimate to use them in other situations like the order effect one . besides",
    ", these models _ have been _ applied to question order effect ( wang and busemeyer 2013 , wang et al .",
    "2014 ) , and it is clear that no extra hypothesis than the ones presented in section  2 is needed for that . in sum , the literature claims that the very same models can be used for the conjunction fallacy and for question order effect , so we are justified in testing them on new order effect cases as linda s .",
    "finally , recall that we consider here two successive yes - no questions , asked in both orders .",
    "thus , the conditional probabilities are interpreted as probabilities of a second answer given a first answer .",
    "this is fully in line with the models of the conjunction fallacy themselves .",

    "so as to increase the robustness of our results , we have chosen these four tasks as they display different kinds of conjunction fallacies , in the sense of tversky and kahneman ( 1983 ) who have distinguished between m  a and a  b paradigms . in the former , a model m ( the text describing the person ) is positively associated with an event a ( one of the two sentences forming the conjunction ) and negatively with the other event b.",

    "the empirical inadequacy of non - degenerate models for the conjunction fallacy has already been discussed , although the question had not been definitely settled ( cf .",

    "the second research hypothesis extends the first one by considering also degenerate models , that is , models in which an answer is represented by a @xmath97-d subspace , e.g a plane .",
    "this hypothesis is shared by all papers cited in the beginning of section  2 , except franco ( 2009 ) : the conjunction fallacy can be accounted for by quantum - like models in general , be they non - degenerate or degenerate .",
    "as argued in section  [ sec_empirical - tests ] , non - degenerate and degenerate models have ( i ) to display an order effect and ( ii ) to respect the qq equality .",

    "note that the consequences of the rejection of this hypothesis have an even much broader impact than the ones deriving from the rejections of previous hypotheses : not only are we rejecting the original modeling strategy exploited by the quantum - like literature based on the introduction of an order effect to explain the conjunction fallacy , but we are also preventing its adoption for any other alternative theory ( bayesian , heuristics ... ) .",

    "such tests can not be performed in traditional conjunction fallacy experiments , in which subjects have to rank propositions , but require an order effect experiment , in which two yes - no questions are asked in either order .",
    "so , the tests concern empirical predictions that are not the data that the models were supposed to explain in the first place , but are predictions of the models anyway , and are directly related to the core feature of the models , namely the incompatibility between questions .",
    "we have performed such order effect experiments , by using a robust protocol that varies the stories ( linda , bill , mr . f. , k. ) , the administration method ( paper questionnaires or computer ) , and a possible payment , with seven tasks in total and several hundreds of subjects .",
    "our empirical results clearly reject the hypothesis that non - degenerate models can account for the conjunction fallacy ( which is the hypothesis made in franco 2009 ) .",
    "this confirms the recent tendency from the advocates of the quantum - like approach to consider non - degenerate models as toy models only .",
    "most importantly , our results also reject the more general hypothesis that non - degenerate or degenerate models can account for the conjunction fallacy , which is the hypothesis made in all other papers .",
    "as we have used very conservative statistical tests , we can safely say this general hypothesis is refuted in at least three tasks out of seven .",
    "so the present paper provides the first clear experimental rejection of the quantum - like explanation of the conjunction fallacy .",
    "now , it may be possible that not _ all _ instances of the conjunction fallacy can be accounted for in a quantum - like fashion , but that _ some _ instances can .",
    "for instance , our experimental results have not formally excluded that bill s scenario could be amenable to a quantum - like account .",
    "there is room for possible future experimental research here  a possible line of division to be investigated could be between ab and ma scenarios of conjunction fallacies .",
    "but thus , the quantum - like account would loose its generality , which was its strength . moreover , if quantum - like models were to apply to some cases of conjunction fallacies , it seems very likely that it should be degenerate versions , since non - degenerate one have been strongly ruled out .",
    "this comes with possible drawbacks or specific duties , as argued in boyer - kassem et al .",
    "in particular , a degenerate model resorts to some extra dimensions in the hilbert space that should receive theoretical and experimental justifications so as not to be just _ ad hoc_. and more general tests on elementary dimensions can also be considered .",
    "as our experimental results speak against the quantum - like models of the conjunction fallacy , they can be interpreted as indirect support in favor of alternative accounts of the conjunction fallacy , like bayesian ones ( e.g. tentori et al .",
    "2013 ) , or other kinds of quantum - like models for the conjunction fallacy that have not been tested in this paper , like yukalov and sornette ( 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "however , our results also provide some conclusions well beyond quantum - like modeling : they show that the conjunction fallacy can not be accounted for by any model or mechanism that relies on order effect , or entails an order effect , between the two characteristics at play (  feminist \" and  bank teller \" in linda s case ) .",
    "quantum - like models are well - known such examples , but it must be clear that any existing or future alternative explanation that involves a question order effect is ruled out .",
    "after the failure of quantum - like models , this places a hard constraint on alternative explanations of the conjunction fallacy .",
    "we suggest that future works should try to theoretically inquire whether alternative explanations predict an order effect , and to experimentally test it .",
    "even if the quantum - like models studied in this paper are not able to account for our data , a possible research strategy could be not to abandon the quantum - like modeling of the conjunction fallacy altogether , but instead to try to modify and improve it so that it finally agrees with the experimental data . in this spirit",
    ", one could investigate whether the use of a more general measurement theory or generalized observables could be adequate .",
    "for instance , the use of positive operator valued measures ( povms ) , from quantum physics , has been recently applied to quantum - like models of cognition ( cf . khrennikov and basieva 2014 ) .",
    "however , it seems to face some new challenges like response replicability ( cf .",
    "khrennikov et al .",
    "2014 , basieva and khrennikov 2015 ) .",
    "another quantum - like line of research that does not face this problem considers a modification of the born rule ( aerts and sassoli de bianchi , 2015 ) .    as a last remark ,",
    "our methodology has been here to test quantum - like models of the conjunction fallacy with new experimental predictions .",
    "we think this methodology could be fruitfully extended to quantum - like models that address other fallacies , such as the disjunction fallacy or the inverse fallacy .",
    "many thanks to corrado lagazio for suggestions on the statistical part .",
