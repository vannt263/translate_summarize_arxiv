    "during the past decade , there have been important advances in our understanding of the mathematical foundations of quantum electrodynamics with non - relativistic , quantum - mechanical matter ( `` non - relativistic qed '' ) .",
    "subtle spectral properties of the hamiltonians generating the time evolution of atoms and molecules interacting with the quantized radiation field have been established .",
    "in particular , existence of atomic ground states and absence of stable excited states have been proven , and the energies and life times of resonances have been calculated in a rigorously controlled way , for a variety of models ; see @xcite , and references given there . furthermore , some important steps towards developing the scattering theory for systems of non - relativistic matter interacting with massless bosons , in particular photons , have been taken .",
    "asymptotic electromagnetic field operators have been constructed in @xcite , and wave operators for compton scattering have been shown to exist in @xcite .",
    "rayleigh scattering , i.e. , the scattering of photons at atoms below their ionization threshold , has been analyzed in @xcite for models with an infrared cutoff .",
    "the results in this paper are based on methods developed in @xcite .",
    "some earlier results on rayleigh scattering have been derived in @xcite .",
    "compton scattering in models with an infrared cutoff has been studied in @xcite . while it is understood how to calculate scattering amplitudes for various low - energy scattering processes in models _ without _ an infrared cutoff , all known _ general _ methods to prove _ unitarity of the scattering matrix _ on subspaces of states of sufficiently low energy , i.e. , _ asymptotic completeness _",
    ", require the presence of an ( arbitrarily small , but _ positive _ ) infrared cutoff . in @xcite , rayleigh scattering has only been studied for models of atoms with _ static _",
    "( i.e. , _ infinitely heavy _ ) nuclei .    as suggested by this discussion , the main challenge in the scattering theory for non - relativistic qed",
    "presently consists in solving the following problems :    1 .   to remove the infrared cutoff in the analysis of rayleigh scattering ; 2 .   to remove the infrared cutoff in the treatment of compton scattering of photons at one freely moving electron or ion ; 3 .   to prove _ asymptotic completeness _ of rayleigh scattering of photons at atoms or molecules with _",
    "dynamical _ nuclei .    in this paper , we solve problem iii ) in the presence of an ( arbitrarily small , but positive ) infrared cutoff . in order to render our analysis , which is quite technical , as simple and transparent as possible , we consider the simplest model exhibiting all typical features and challenges encountered in an analysis of problem iii ) .",
    "we consider a hydrogen atom or a one - electron ion .",
    "the nucleus is described , like the electron , as a non - relativistic quantum - mechanical point particle of _ finite _ mass .",
    "we ignore the spin degrees of freedom of the electron and the nucleus .",
    "the electron and the nucleus interact with each other through an attractive two - body potential @xmath0 , which can be chosen to be the electrostatic coulomb potential .",
    "electron and nucleus are coupled to a quantized radiation field . as in @xcite , the field quanta of the radiation field are massless bosons , which we will call photons .",
    "physically , the radiation field is the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "however , the helicity of the photons does not play an interesting role in our analysis , and we therefore consider _ scalar _ bosons .",
    "as announced , we focus our attention on rayleigh scattering ; i.e. , we only consider the asymptotic dynamics of states of the atom and the radiation field with energies below the threshold for break - up of the atom into a freely moving nucleus and electron , i.e. , below the ionization threshold .",
    "moreover , we introduce an _ infrared cutoff _ : photons with an energy below a certain arbitrarily small , but positive threshold energy do _ not _ interact with the nucleus and the electron .",
    "while all our other simplifications are purely cosmetic , the presence of an infrared cutoff is crucial in our proof of asymptotic completeness ( but _ not _ for most other results presented in this paper ) .    in the model we study , the atom can be located anywhere in physical space and can move around freely , and the hamiltonian of the system is translation - invariant .",
    "this feature suggests to combine and extend the techniques in two previous papers , @xcite ( rayleigh scattering with static nuclei ) and @xcite ( compton scattering of photons at freely moving electrons ) , and this is , in fact , the strategy followed in the present paper .",
    "as in @xcite , to prove asymptotic completeness we must impose an upper bound on the energy of the state of the system that guarantees that the center of mass velocity of the atom does not exceed one third of the velocity of light .",
    "this is a purely technical restriction which we believe can be replaced by one that guarantees that the velocity of the atom is less than the velocity of light .",
    "we note that , for realistic atoms , the condition that the total energy of a state be below the ionization threshold of an atom at rest automatically guarantees that the speed of the atom in an arbitrary internal state is much less than a third of the speed of light .",
    "next , we describe the model studied in this paper more explicitly . the hilbert space of pure states is given by @xmath1 where the variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the positions of the nucleus and of the electron , respectively , and @xmath4 is the symmetric fock space over the one - photon hilbert space @xmath5 , where the variable @xmath6 denotes the momentum of a photon .",
    "vectors in @xmath4 describe pure states of the radiation field .",
    "the hamiltonian generating the time evolution of states of the system is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the atom decoupled from the radiation field . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momentum operators of the electron and the nucleus , respectively , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are their masses .",
    "the term @xmath13 is the potential of an attractive two - body force , e.g. , the electrostatic coulomb force , between the electron and the nucleus ; ( @xmath14 is negative and tends to zero , as @xmath15 , and it is assumed to be such that the spectrum of @xmath16 is bounded from below and has at least one negative eigenvalue ) . the operator @xmath17 on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : ham1 ] )",
    "is the hamiltonian of the free radiation field .",

    "in many of our results , we could pass to the limit @xmath38 ; but in our proof of asymptotic completeness of rayleigh scattering , the condition that @xmath37 is essential . finally ,",
    "the parameter @xmath39 on r.h.s . of ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) is a coupling constant ; it is assumed to be non - negative and will be chosen sufficiently small in the proofs of our results .",

    "we are now in the position to summarize the main results proven in this paper for the model introduced above . in a first part",
    ", we analyze the energy spectra of the fiber hamiltonians @xmath76 below a certain threshold @xmath77 , where @xmath56 is given in , and @xmath78 ; @xmath79 is the ground state energy of @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a constant @xmath82 ( @xmath83speed of light , in our units ) .",
    "the condition @xmath84 guarantees that the electron is bound to the nucleus , with exponential decay in @xmath45 , and @xmath85 implies that , for a sufficiently small coupling constant @xmath39 , the center - of - mass velocity of the atom is smaller than the speed of light .",

    ", we prove that the spectrum of @xmath76 in the interval @xmath94 is purely continuous .",
    "with relatively little further effort , our methods would also show that @xmath95 is absolutely continuous .",
    "( these results , too , would survive the removal of the infrared cutoff , @xmath96 .",

    "we denote the ground state of @xmath97 , by @xmath98 ; ( @xmath98 is called the _ dressed atom _",

    "the last condition ensures that the distance between the atom and a configuration of outgoing photons increases to infinity and hence the interaction between these photons and the atom tends to @xmath115 , as time @xmath104 tends to @xmath116 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath121 , under the same assumptions .",
    "equation provides the justification for calling the vectors @xmath122 _ scattering states_. we already know that the atom does _ not _ have any stable excited states .",
