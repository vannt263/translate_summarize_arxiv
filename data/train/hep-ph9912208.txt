    "a langevin equation of the form    [ eq : theory0 ] @xmath6 @xmath7    can appear as the effective description of highly overdamped motion of some coordinates @xmath3 in a potential @xmath8 in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "the damping , and the random force term , arise from interactions with the thermal bath . by overdamped ,",
    "i mean that at a slightly more fundamental level , the equation of motion might be , for instance , @xmath9 with @xmath10 as before . here",
    ", @xmath11 is a damping coefficient , and @xmath10 is a gaussian thermal noise term . in the limit that @xmath11 is large compared to the inverse time scales of interest , one can ignore the @xmath12 term and so obtain ( [ eq : l0 ] ) .    in this article ,",
    "i want to consider the case where ( a ) the damping coefficient @xmath11 depends on @xmath3 itself ,    [ eq : l1 ] @xmath13 @xmath14    and ( b ) it is already know through other means that @xmath15 is an effective potential that gives the equilibrium distribution of @xmath3 as @xmath16 \\label{eq : peq}\\ ] ] in whatever approximation may be relevant to the problem of interest . equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) is a special case of what are known as langevin equations with multiplicative noise . in general ,",
    "such equations are notorious for being ambiguous  they are sensitive to exactly how one discretizes time .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that , with a few very general assumptions , the property ( [ eq : peq ] ) is sufficient to uniquely resolve this ambiguity .",
    "moreover , this resolution does _ not _ correspond to any standard interpretation ( it or stratanovich ) of the langevin equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) .",
    "though my arguments will be somewhat general , it helps to have in mind a concrete example of an _",
    "un_-ambiguous description for which ( [ eq : l1 ] ) will be a limiting case .",
    "a simple example is the analog of ( [ eq : newt1 ] ) with @xmath3-dependent damping : @xmath17 with the noise again ( [ eq : l1b ] ) .",
    "as i discuss in appendix [ app : inertia ] , this equation is unambiguous and has equilibrium distribution ( [ eq : peq ] ) .",
    "i ca nt resist mentioning the application of interest to me personally , which motivated this work @xcite : electroweak baryon number violation in the early universe .",
    "its study requires understanding the effective dynamics of fluctuations in weakly - coupled high - temperature non - abelian gauge theories , where there is an effective theory of the form ( [ eq : l1 ] ) at the relevant distance and time scales , but where it is much more straightforward to analyze static issues , such as ( [ eq : peq ] ) , than the subtleties of dynamical ones .",
    "let s rewrite ( [ eq : l1 ] ) in the equivalent form    [ eq : g1 ] @xmath18 @xmath19    where the @xmath3 dependence has been scaled out of the noise by defining @xmath20 , and the matrix @xmath21 and vector @xmath22 are @xmath23^{-1/2 } , \\ ] ] @xmath24 two standard conventions for discretizing time , and so removing the ambiguities inherent in equations like ( [ eq : l1 ] ) , are the it convention , and @xmath25 are that reference s @xmath26 and @xmath27 . ] @xmath28 and the stratanovich convention , @xmath29 @xmath30 where in both cases the discretized noise correlation is @xmath31 the specification of @xmath32 as opposed to @xmath33 in ( [ eq : langstrat ] ) is actually irrelevant : it is only the @xmath3 used to evaluate @xmath34 that causes the difference between these two conventions in the @xmath35 limit",
    ".    if one simply tries setting @xmath36 or @xmath37 , the it and stratanovich equations will give rise to different physics , and in particular different equilibrium distributions .",
    "the two conventions are identical in the @xmath35 limit only if one sets @xmath38 ( here and throughout , i adopt the notation that indices after a comma represent derivatives : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . )    the value of @xmath22 that should be used for a particular physical problem therefore depends on what discretization convention one picks to use .",
    "since the value of @xmath22 is ambiguous , one approach might be to simply pick a discretization convention ( it does nt matter which one ) , and then choose @xmath22 however necessary to reproduce the desired equilibrium distribution ( [ eq : peq ] ) . to be concrete ,",
    "let s choose stratanovich convention .",
    "the stratanovich langevin equation ( [ eq : langstrat ] ) is well known to be equivalent to the following fokker - planck equation for the time evolution of the probability distribution @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{eq : fp}\\ ] ] my requirement is that this equation have the equilibrium distribution ( [ eq : peq ] ) as a time - independent solution .",
    "a simple way to achieve this is for @xmath43 which gives @xmath44 compare to our naive starting point ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath45 so one might suspect that the stratanovich equation ( [ eq : langstrat ] ) together with ( [ eq : fstrat ] ) , or equivalently the it equation ( [ eq : langito ] ) together with ( [ eq : fito ] ) , gives the correct description of the system .",
    "as we shall see , this is indeed the case .",
    "based on the presentation so far , the reader might be suspicious of two things .",
    "first , once we give ourselves license to go mucking around with the equation , changing what we thought was @xmath46 to suit our needs , how do we know we are nt supposed to change other things as well ?",
    "in particular , what tells us that we should nt change @xmath2 in some way , then make some compensating change in @xmath22 to force the equilibrium distribution to work out ?",
    "the basic answer is that @xmath22 is sensitive to the details of short - time physics and regularization , whereas @xmath34 is not , as evidenced by the fact @xmath22 must be changed when one adopts different conventions like it or stratanovich , but @xmath34 need not .",
    "this boils down to a discussion of the renormalizeability of the theory , and its consequences for how , in principle , the theory should be matched to a more fundamental description of the physics .",
    "such issues are more familiar in the context of theories defined by path integrals , and so much of the rest of this paper will be to translate the discussion into that language .    secondly , the stratanovich @xmath22 of ( [ eq : fstrat ] ) is not the unique solution to ( [ eq : fp ] ) for @xmath47 .",
    "the general solution is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is any function with @xmath50 .",
    "i shall throughout focus on systems where the underlying physics , whatever it may be , is reversible .",
    "more specifically , i shall assume that the effective theory ( [ eq : theory0 ] ) must be defined in such a way that equilibrium time - dependent correlations , such as @xmath51 , are invariant under time reversal .",
    "[ as discussed in appendix [ app : inertia ] , the behavior of the langevin equation with inertia ( [ eq : langinertia ] ) has this property , even though the equation by itself is not time - reversal invariant . ] as i ll show , this assumption will rule out the extra term involving @xmath52 in ( [ eq : fh ] ) .",
    "i shall then discuss in more detail , in the language of path integrals , how the issue of whether @xmath34 or @xmath22 should be modified from their `` naive '' values is an issue of renormalizeability .",
    "specifically , i will define `` naive '' by assuming that there is some more fundamental description of the effective theory , such as the langevin equation ( [ eq : langinertia ] ) with inertia , that is unambiguous and is described in terms of the same degrees of freedom @xmath3 .",
    "the `` naive '' values of @xmath34 and @xmath22 will simply be those defined by naively taking the low frequency limit of the more fundamental equation .",
    "i ll show that terms associated with @xmath34 require no ultraviolet renormalization , while terms associated with @xmath22 do . based on general procedures for matching effective theories to more fundamental underlying theories",
    ", one may then argue that @xmath22 , and not @xmath34 , should be modified to make the physics work out right .",

    "now let s divorce ourselves from the particular form ( [ eq : fstrat ] ) that i ve claimed for @xmath22 .",

    ".    i will now show that the @xmath91 term in ( [ eq : lgeneric ] ) requires counter - terms , but the @xmath92 term does not .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : l2 ] ) is super - renormalizeable : counter - terms are needed only for one loop and two loop diagrams .",
    "this can be seen by simple power counting of diagrams .",
    "the most ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent diagrams will be those whose vertices involve as many powers as possible of internal frequency .",
    "that is , vertices generated by the @xmath93 terms in ( [ eq : l2 ] ) will give more uv divergent behavior than vertices generated by the @xmath91 terms . and the most divergent behavior will occur when the @xmath94 s are associated with internal rather than external lines .",
    "the most divergent one - loop diagrams are therefore those depicted by fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] . the uv behavior of such graphs is @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the powers of @xmath97 from the @xmath8 vertices @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are the @xmath100 behavior of the @xmath101 internal propagators .",
    "so this class of diagrams is linearly divergent in the uv .",
    "the linearly divergent piece is independent of external frequencies , and so requires a counterterm in @xmath91 but not one in the kinetic term @xmath102 .",
    "that is , so far we have seen that the effective @xmath91 is dependent on the details of short - time physics , but we have not seen any evidence that @xmath92 is .    are there divergences associated with external frequency dependence ? expanding the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] in powers of external momenta , each such power will come at the expense of one of the factors of @xmath97 in ( [ eq:1power ] ) .",
    "so no counter - terms involving two external frequencies are necessary  that is , no counterterm for @xmath102 is necessary . there could be a log divergence associated with one external frequency factor , except that the resulting @xmath97 integral @xmath103 vanishes by the assumption that the equilibrium physics is time - reversal invariant ( and the fact that i am using a symmetric discretization of the path integral , which respects that invariance ) .",
    "similarly , one could imagine a different method of hooking up the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] in which one or more of the @xmath94 factors were associated with external rather than internal lines .",
    "if this happens for two or more factors , the loop integral is no longer uv divergent and so in not sensitive to short - time physics .",
    "if it happens for only one factor , then the loop integral again vanishes by the assumption of time - reversal invariance .",
    "therefore , the linear uv divergence ( [ eq:1power ] ) previously discussed is the _ only _ uv divergence at one loop .    now consider two loop diagrams , again maximizing the divergence by using @xmath98 vertices rather than @xmath91 ones , and associating all @xmath94 s with internal lines .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .",
    "simple power counting gives the maximum possible new divergence at two loops as order @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath97 just counts powers of combinations of the two loop frequencies @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "a logarithmic divergence is possible , but this divergence has no dependence on external frequencies . as before , if we focus on the dependence of these diagrams on external frequency , then there is no sensitivity to short - time physics . if we go to yet higher orders in diagrams , there are no new divergences at all : naive power counting gives @xmath108 for an @xmath53-loop diagram .",
    "the upshot of all this is that only @xmath91 is sensitive to the details of short - time physics ; @xmath102 is not .    in the language of path integrals ,",
    "the `` naive '' low frequency limit of a theory is what you get if you simply replace the lagrangian by its low frequency limit .",
    "this replacement is naive when there are uv divergences in the resulting effective theory , which make the physics of that theory sensitive to how it is cut off in the uv  that is , sensitive to the details of the more fundamental theory .",
    "fortunately , these details can be absorbed into a redefinition of the effective interactions which depend on them . in this case , that means @xmath91 is modified from its naive form , but @xmath102 is not .",
    "since this point is important , let me state it another way . the basic theory and technology of matching parameters of low - frequency effective theories to those of more fundamental theories , to any and all orders in perturbation theory , has been used in a number of problems in field theory , including bose condensation @xcite , ultrarelativistic plasmas , heavy quark physics @xcite , and non - relativistic plasma physics @xcite .",
    "( for a general discussion , see also ref .",
    "the basic idea is to fix a regularization for the effective theory , to then treat all the parameters of the effective theory as adjustable , to calculate low - frequency observables in both the effective theory and the more fundamental theory , and then to fix the parameters of the effective theory to obtain agreement .",
    "if we simply fixed @xmath92 and @xmath91 to be their naive values , everything would match order by order in perturbation theory if it were nt for the uv divergences in the effective theory ",
    "if diagrams only involved low frequencies in propagators and vertices , then each internal line and vertex in the underlying theory would match up with each one in the naive effective theory .",
    "the only thing we have to correct for are uv divergent graphs or sub - graphs , where the correspondence would fail .",
    "but the previous discussion shows that such divergences have the form of counter - terms for @xmath91 , and so the matching of the two theories can be fixed by appropriate adjustment of those counter - terms .",
    "if we had a specific underlying theory in mind , we cold carry out this matching procedure by computing to two loops in perturbation theory .",
    "the crucial point here is that such a calculation is unnecessary , and detailed knowledge of the underlying theory is unnecessary , if we know that the equilibrium distribution is ( [ eq : peq ] ) .",
    "we can then immediately solve the problem by simply requiring that we choose @xmath91 so that the equilibrium distribution comes out right .",
    "returning to the lagrangian ( [ eq : lresult ] ) corresponding to the original langevin equation , the only way we can change @xmath91 without changing @xmath102 is by changing @xmath22 , which justifies the argument for choosing @xmath61 given in section [ sec : first ] .",
    "alternatively , one can uniquely determine @xmath91 directly by requiring that the euclidean schrdinger equation , corresponding to the path integral with the generic lagrangian @xmath75 ( [ eq : lgeneric ] ) , generate @xmath57 as its equilibrium distribution .",
    "this is carried out in appendix [ app : h ] , which also explains some interesting distinctions between the interpretation of the euclidean schrdinger equation associated with @xmath75 [ ( [ eq : l2 ] ) or ( [ eq : lgeneric ] ) ] and that associated with @xmath53 ( [ eq : lresult ] ) .",
    "the final result agrees with the initial analysis of section ( [ sec : first ] ) .",

    "the langevin equation ( [ eq : langinertia ] ) with inertia can be written in the form of a standard first - order langevin equation by rewriting it as a system of first order equations , introducing @xmath109 :    [ eq : inertia2 ] @xmath110    this equation is free of the usual discretization ambiguities . to see this , consider the difference between stratanovich and it discretization conventions , which differ in how the @xmath3 in the @xmath111 term is evaluated .",
    "that difference in @xmath3 is @xmath112 , which means a difference in the @xmath111 term of @xmath113 in a langevin equation such as our effective theory ( [ eq : g1 ] ) , this would not vanish in the @xmath35 limit because @xmath114 is order @xmath115 , and then so is @xmath94 by the equation of motion ( [ eq : g1 ] ) . in the case at hand , matters are different , because @xmath116 , and , though ( [ eq : inertia2a ] ) implies that the time derivative @xmath117 will be order @xmath115 , @xmath118 itself is perfectly finite as @xmath35 .",

    "\\label{eq : sch2}\\ ] ]    i have used the symbol @xmath166 instead of @xmath167 in this equation because the equilibrium result for @xmath166 must be the square root of the probability distribution . that is , we want the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sch2 ] ) to have @xmath168 as its solution rather than @xmath57 . to understand this , consider the original lagrangian @xmath53 from the discussion of the path integral form of langevin equations .",
    "@xmath53 differed from @xmath75 only by a total time derivative .",
    "the schrdinger equation corresponding to @xmath53 is simply the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) , which i ll now write in the form @xmath169 both formulations , in terms of @xmath53 or @xmath75 , should generate the same equilibrium physics ",
    "that is , the same time - dependent correlation functions .",
    "a crucial difference between @xmath170 and @xmath171 , however , is that the operator @xmath170 is hermitian , while @xmath171 is not .",
    "now think about what it means to write down a path integral expression for the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath172 in terms of actions that run between arbitrarily large times @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding object in the schrdinger formulation is @xmath175 where @xmath176 can be either @xmath171 or @xmath170 .",
    "what dominates the long - time evolution operator @xmath177 is the equilibrium state , which i ll denote @xmath178 .",
    "the difference between @xmath179 and @xmath180 is that the long - time evolution generated by the @xmath170 must be symmetric in its overlap with the initial and final states , becuase @xmath170 is hermitian .",
    "that is , in the large @xmath181 limit , @xmath182 @xmath171 is not hermitian and so does not have this symmetry . in fact , we know from the usual fokker - planck equation corresponding to @xmath179 that the evolution is dissipative , and the result of long - time evolution is independent of initial conditions .",
    "so @xmath183 in the case of @xmath180 , ( [ eq : px ] ) then becomes @xmath184 whereas for @xmath179 it becomes @xmath185 one can now see that the equilibrium wave function represents the square root of @xmath186 in the case of @xmath180 but @xmath186 itself in the case of @xmath179 .    in any case",
    ", we can now uniquely determine @xmath187 , and hence @xmath91 , simply by requiring that the equilibrium amplitude ( [ eq : psieq ] ) be a solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sch2 ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath188 which precisely reproduces the result ( [ eq : l2 ] ) for the @xmath75 that describes the langevin equation , with my claimed result ( [ eq : fstrat ] ) for @xmath61 .",
