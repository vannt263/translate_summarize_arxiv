    "<S> the suppressed quark yield and high quark / gluon ratio , especially at rhic , will lead to the modification of final - state parton spectra at large @xmath2 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rparton ] . because gluon fragmentation functions are softer than quarks , the increased fraction of gluon jets in @xmath0 collisions will lead to apparent suppression of high @xmath2 hadron spectra relative to @xmath1 collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the modified flavor composition of the final parton due to multiple scattering in pa collisions could also change the flavor composition of final hadrons due to flavor - dependence of the fragmentation functions . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , the proton - to - pion ratio in @xmath20 collisions at rhic and @xmath21 collisions at lhc will still be larger than that in @xmath1 collisions because of the enhanced gluon - to - quark ratio in @xmath0 collisions relative to that in @xmath1 as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> jet parton showers from all hard scatterings , including initial and final - state radiations , are ordered in rapidity and gluons are then connected to the valence quark and diquark of the associated projectile or target nucleons as kinks to form string systems . </S>",

    "<S> it is in sharp contrast to the prediction of disappearance of the peak in gluon saturation model or relocation to much higher @xmath2 due to strong anti - shadowing in the collinear pqcd parton model </S>",
    "<S> . experimental test of these features will shed light on the parton dynamics in high - energy nuclei .    at very large @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> parton shadowing in nuclei , soft - hard coupling and enhanced gluonic jets due to valence quark conservation all lead to suppression of charged hadron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> fragmentation of the projectile string system with multiple gluon jets in @xmath0 collisions seems to further suppress high-@xmath2 hadron spectra as compared to the independent fragmentation ( dotted ) . </S>",
    "<S> these nuclear effects are consistent with existing @xmath20 data at rhic </S>",
    "<S> . however , @xmath21 collisions at lhc will be able to test these scenarios within the available @xmath2 range . </S>",
    "<S> since parton shadowing will disappear at large @xmath2 @xcite due to qcd evolution and hard scatterings are de - coherent from soft interactions , the nuclear modification factor at lhc will likely follow the default and dhc results at low @xmath2 and approach dhc without shadowing at large @xmath2 with possible further modifications due to hadronization of multiple jets . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> note that there is no jet quenching effect in the calculation shown . on the parton level </S>",
    "<S> , the nuclear modification at large @xmath2 mainly comes from parton shadowing which should be small if the scale dependence of shadowing is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the final hadron spectra at large @xmath2 are however significantly suppressed due to the lund string fragmentation of multiple parton systems ( solid and dashed curves in the lower panel ) leaving no room for additional suppression by jet quenching as compared to experimental data from alice @xcite and cms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong indication that the lund string fragmentation for hadronization is no longer a valid mode for multiple gluonic jet systems in heavy - ion collisions where a deconfined quark - gluon plasma is formed . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies show that multiple parton scatterings inside a quark - gluon plasma can in fact change the the color flow of the jet parton shower from that in vacuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore should expect the fragmentation processes in heavy - ion collisions to be significantly modified from that in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> an independent jet fragmentation mechanism such as parton recombination model might be a better alternative where local parton phase distributions determine the final hadron spectra and global color flow of the multiple jet system is no longer important . </S>",
    "<S> since multiple gluonic jet systems in pa collisions can be considered as precursors of the quark - gluon plasma , investigation of the final hadron spectra at large @xmath2 in @xmath0 collisions can shed light on the hadronization mechanism of energetic jets after they escape jet quenching and emerge from the quark - gluon plasma in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the nuclear modification of hadron spectra in @xmath0 collisions at both the rhic and lhc energies within hijing2.1 monte carlo model and their sensitivities to cold nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> multiple parton correlations in the projectile due to valence quark number conservation , string fragmentation of multiple gluon jets as well as parton shadowing can all lead to suppression of high-@xmath2 hadron spectra in @xmath0 relative to @xmath1 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons between hijing2.1 results without jet quenching and existing data on large @xmath2 hadron suppression at lhc indicate an independence fragmentation mechanism for multiple jet systems such as in pa and aa collisions . </S>",
    "<S> experimental test of these effects in @xmath21 collisions at lhc and its implications for hard scatterings in @xmath9 collisions is crucial for the study of jet quenching and extraction of jet transport properties in the hot quark - gluon plasma . </S>"
