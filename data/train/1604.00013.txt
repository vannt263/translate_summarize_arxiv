    "it is widely accepted that most interacting supernovae ( sne ) arise from the collapse of the nucleus of massive stars ( @xmath3m@xmath4 ) exploding in a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) , although a fraction of them could result from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , the cocoon - like csm surrounding the progenitor system",
    "is generated via stationary stellar winds , binary interaction or even multiple eruptive events as a consequence of instabilities during the latest stages of the stellar life .",
    "+ the most common interacting core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) have spectra dominated by h lines .",
    "their spectra are characterised by a blue continuum with superimposed prominent balmer lines in emission , usually showing profiles with multiple components .",
    "these are probably produced in gas shells moving at different velocities , and having different temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "in particular , the spectra show narrow components in emission at all stages of the sn evolution , which are recombination lines emitted by the un - shocked photo - ionised csm , although , in some cases , narrow components disappear soon after maximum , as the un - shocked csm recombines ( see e.g. sn  1998s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this gas is located in the outer circumstellar environment , and moves at relatively low velocities , from a few tens to about one thousandkm  s@xmath2  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". + intermediate components in the line profiles ( with inferred velocities of a few 1000 km  s@xmath2 ) are also frequently observed , and are considered as one of the signatures of interaction between the sn ejecta and the csm , since they probably form in the regions of shocked gas @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the photo - ionised un - shocked csm and the shocked gas interface frequently mask the freely expanding sn ejecta @xcite , limiting our understanding of the explosion mechanism .",
    "however , when the csm is optically thin or because of its particular geometry , the broad lines associated with the sn ejecta can be observed .",
    "the presence of high - velocity ejecta ( @xmath5 km  s@xmath2  for the bulk of the material ) along with the high temperatures of the ejected gas ( @xmath5  k , usually inferred from a black - body fit to the spectral continuum ) , and the slow colour / temperature evolution are key ingredients to characterise the explosion .",

    "+ a key improvement in our comprehension of sne iin resulted from the evidence of a connection between some members of this sn type with a rare class of very massive and unstable stars , the so - called ` luminous blue variables ' ( lbvs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lbvs are luminous ( @xmath9 - @xmath10  l@xmath4 ) and very massive ( @xmath11m@xmath4 ) evolved stars close to the eddington limit , characterised by an erratic instability of their outer layers and a high rate of mass loss ( @xmath12m@xmath4  @xmath13 ) .",
    "these stars normally sit into the ` s - doradus instability strip ' in the hertzsprung - russel ( h - r ) diagram .",
    "moderate ` s  doradus ( s  dor ) type ' variability , is related to mass - loss episodes involving the outer layers . during this phase , lasting from years to decades ,",

    "micro - variations , of the order of a few tenths magnitudes on a time scale of weeks to months are also usually observed . during their quiescent phase lbvs experience typical supergiant mass - loss rates ( @xmath14m@xmath4@xmath15 ) , which significantly increase during the s  dor phase ( up to @xmath16m@xmath4@xmath15 ) .",
    "occasionally lbvs may produce giant eruptions ( like that observed in @xmath17 carinae in the mid-19th century ) , during which they lose a significant mass fraction of their envelope ( up to @xmath18m@xmath4 , with mass - loss rates exceeding @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath20m@xmath4@xmath15 ) and experience a dramatic increase ( 36  mag ) in luminosity @xcite , reaching absolute bolometric magnitudes at peak of above @xmath21 .",
    "the mechanism triggering the giant eruptions is not fully understood , although a few scenarios have been proposed .",
    "+ the link between some sne iin and lbvs is based on the detection of the progenitor stars of two type iin sne in archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) images , viz .",
    "sn  2005gl @xcite and sn  2010jl @xcite .",
    "the putative progenitors both showed absolute magnitudes consistent with those observed in quiescent lbvs .",
    "an indirect clue of this connection is given by signatures of a structured csm in the spectra of some type iin sne , including sn  2005gj , with evidence of several shell - like layers inferred from the presence of multiple absorption features with bulk velocities consistent with those of lbv winds .",
    "+ a further step in establishing a connection between lbvs and sne iin has been made through the study of the pre - sn photometric variability of the precursor stars , using archival images collected months to years before the sn explosion .",
    "the data archive inspection is , in fact , an invaluable tool to characterise the final stages of the progenitors of interacting transients .",
    "weak transient events with luminosities consistent with those expected in lbv outbursts are occasionally detected weeks to years before major re - brightenings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "+ nonetheless , in most cases , outbursts attributed to extragalactic massive stars are registered as isolated events ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these are fainter than real sne ( @xmath24 to @xmath21 ) , but mimic the behavior of type iin sne , showing similar spectra dominated by prominent narrow balmer lines in emission , and sometimes even similar light - curves .",
    "they are usually labelled as ` supernova impostors ' @xcite , as they are not terminal sn explosions .",
    "accounting for the evidence of photometric variability from massive stars , a sequential event chain linking lbvs , sn impostors and sne iin has been proposed .",
    "+ in this context , it is worth mentioning the controversial case of sn  2009ip , an interacting transient whose real nature ( sn explosion vs. non - terminal outburst ) is still debated .",
    "the detection of the progenitor star in archival hst images proved it to be consistent with a massive star ",
    "most likely an lbv  with a zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) mass of @xmath25m@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "sn  2009ip was well studied in the years ahead of the putative sn explosion and exhibited erratic luminosity oscillations since summer 2009 @xcite . in july 2012 , it experienced a further re - brightening lasting a few weeks , @xmath26  days before a major outburst , in which the object reached an absolute magnitude competing with those of type iin sne .",
    "however , a conclusive proof of the terminal sn explosion is still missing @xcite , as the expected spectral signatures ( such as nucleosynthesized elements ) of a sn produced in the explosion of a very massive star have not been detected yet in the spectra of sn 2009ip @xcite . a similar sequence of events was observed also for sn  2010mc @xcite , with the detection of an outburst @xmath27  days before the putative terminal sn explosion .",
    "+ sn  2011ht @xcite is another interesting example .",

    "+ the lbv stage is a short - duration phase in the life of very massive stars * ( @xmath29m@xmath4 ) * , which are then expected to become h - stripped wr stars before exploding  after a relatively long time  as type ib / c sne .",
    "however , current stellar evolution codes do not predict the explosion of a ccsn soon after a major instability phase . nonetheless , in the light of the sequences of events involving interacting transients that have been observed in growing number , ad hoc scenarios have been proposed",

    "* ) , and some efforts have been devoted to include the effects of instabilities in stellar evolution codes @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , we report the results of the follow - up campaign of lsq13zm , observed in the galaxy sdss  j102654.56 + 195254.8 .",
