    "in the minimal supergravity model(msugra)@xcite , five arbitrary parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , sig(@xmath9 ) ) are included .",

    "recently , the mass of standard model(sm ) higgs boson has been evaluated by lep@xcite .",
    "the reported higgs mass is slight smaller than expected .",
    "this fact encourages the msugra , because such light value of the higgs mass is supported as one of the features of this model .",
