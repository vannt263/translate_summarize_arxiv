    "during the past two decades , enormous progress has been achieved in understanding the electronic and optical properties of self - assembled quantum dots ( qds ) both through theory and experiments , stimulated by their potential applications in qds laser at room temperature , @xcite and as qubits and quantum photon emitters at low temperature .",
    "@xcite for the former applications , it generally requires high density and highly uniform qds .",
    "the qd laser has been demonstrated with much lower threshold current @xmath0 and much higher material and differential gains as compared to the semiconductor quantum well lasers .",
    "@xcite for the latter applications ,",
    "the preparation of single qd is crucial .",
    "a number of methods have demonstrated the feasibility to isolate single qd from qds ensemble .",
    "@xcite rabi oscillation of exciton and charged exciton @xcite in single qd have been observed experimentally , showing that the charge and spin quantum states in single qd can be coherently controlled via optical method .",
    "the single and entangled photon emission from single qd have also been demonstrated experimentally , @xcite that are much brighter @xcite than the traditional parameter - down entangled photon source . @xcite",
    "these experimental achievements pave the way for future application of qds in quantum computation .    on the other hand , the development of the atomistic theories , including the empirical pseudopotential method @xcite and the tight - binding models @xcite provide deep insight to the electronic and optical properties of self - assembled qds .",
    "the atomistic theories of qds not only give results that agree well with experiments , @xcite but also greatly improve our understanding of the properties of qds .",
    "the atomistic models capture the correct point group symmetry of the qds , which is missing in the continuum model . therefore they can give correct interpretation of some subtle properties of the qds , e.g. , the fine structure splitting ( fss ) , @xcite and light polarization of excition .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , so far all the theories of qds have been restricted to zero temperature .",
    "temperature is a very important degree of freedom in experiments to tune the electronic and optical properties of qds .",
    "for example , in qds laser , the temperature has be used to tune the laser wavelength .",
    "@xcite in the qd - cavity system , the temperature is generally used to tune the resonance between the qds and the cavity in order to achieve strong coupling between the two quantum systems .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependent optical spectra of ( single and ensemble ) qds have been investigated intensively in experiments in the past decades .",
    "@xcite new physics , for example , the formation of excitonic polaron@xcite which is due to strong coupling between exciton and optical phonons , may be found in qds at high temperature . however , a theoretical understanding of the temperature effects in qds is still missing .",
    "therefore , to facilitate the future device applications of qds , the development of a temperature dependent theory is not only of theoretical interest , but also of practical importance .    in this work ,",
    "we develop such a temperature dependent atomistic pseudopotential theory to study the electronic and optical properties of qds at finite temperature .",
    "we take the effects of both lattice expansion and lattice vibration into account .",
    "the latter is done by introducing a temperature dependent dynamical debye - waller factor to the structure factor .",
    "we first examine the temperature dependent electronic structures of bulk inas and gaas , and then apply the theory to investigate the electronic and optical properties of self - assembled inas / gaas qds .",
    "the calculated temperature dependent photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of qds are in excellent agreement with available experimental data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - methods ] we introduce the temperature dependent empirical pseudopotential method ( tdepm ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec - bulk ] , we study the electronic structures of bulk inas , gaas using tdepm , including the energy band gaps and band offsets , etc .",

    "[ subsec - band offset ] and the single particle energy levels and wave functions of inas / gaas qds in sec .",

    "[ subsec - pl ] , and summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec - summary ] .",
    "we consider ingaas qds embedded in the center of a 60 @xmath1 60 @xmath1 60 gaas 8-atom unit cell .",
    "periodic boundary condition is used to obtain the single particle energy levels . to study the electronic and optical properties of the qds at finite temperature , we introduce temperature dependent pseudopotentials in the single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strain dependent screened empirical pseudopotential for atom of type @xmath4 and atom index @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath11 is fitted to the deformation potentials of the bulk materials .",
    "the atomistic theory naturally captures the correct point group symmetry of the qds even at high temperature .",
    "the effects of lattice vibration can be taken into account using brooks - yu theory , @xcite which has been applied to study the energy gap of bulk materials in the context of pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite the total atomic potential at temperature @xmath6 , which is the sum of all atomic potentials @xmath3 , can be written as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reciprocal lattice vector .",

    ", we have @xmath25 using wick s theorem .",
    "@xcite therefore , the temperature effects to the atomic potentials are equivalent to consider a temperature dependent structure factor , @xmath26 in eq .",

    "the second term in the bracket is from zero point quantum fluctuation , which can be absorbed to the zero - temperature pseudopotentials . at high temperature , the acoustic phonon displacement @xmath37 , whereas in the low - temperature limit , @xmath38 . for the optical phonons ,",
    "the average displacement can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the frequency of the optical phonon .",
    "we neglect the dispersion of optical phonons here",
    ". generally , the contribution of the optical phonon could be significant only at high temperature .",
    "@xcite although @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be calculated directly using the parameters of bulk materials , the approximations made during the derivations of eq .",
    "( [ eq - dw - a ] ) and ( [ eq - dw - o ] ) can introduce some errors to the energy gap of semiconductors at finite temperature . to overcome this problem",
    ", we treat @xmath41 and @xmath42 as fitting parameters , which are fitted to the temperature dependent band structures in combination with the zero - temperature empirical pseudopotentials .",
    "therefore , the dynamical debye - waller factors might be different from the real physical debye - waller factors of the system .",

    "@xcite for example , red shift of exciton emission line in single qds have been investigated by ortner _",

    "[ fig - exp ] , we present the exciton energies as a functions of temperature , which also show excellent agreement . the red shift of exciton energy in ref . can be well described by varshni formula using @xmath57 mev / k and @xmath58 k , with error less than 1 mev .",
    "this is also in a good agreement with the theoretical values for qd - b given in table [ table - varshni ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - exp ] ( b ) , we compare the theoretical results of qd - a and qd - c with the experimental results for qds ensemble measured by yeo et al .",
    "@xcite where the peak energy of @xmath59-shell is chosen as the exciton emission lines at each temperature . for qds ensemble",
    ", the @xmath59-shell can be well resolved even at room temperature .",
    "we see that the red shifts of qds ensemble @xmath60 and @xmath61 agree well with the theoretical prediction of qd - a .",
    "moreover , the exciton energy of @xmath60 and @xmath61 at zero temperature is around 1.02 - 1.03 ev , also agree well with the exciton energy of qd - a listed in table [ table - varshni ] .",

    "in both figures , the insets depict the exciton energies as functions of temperature.,width=259 ]    we note that some experiments@xcite suggest that the redshift of the exciton energies proportional to @xmath62 , @xcite instead of @xmath63 as suggested by tdepm at very low temperature ( @xmath64 k ) .",
    "the discrepancy may come from two reasons .",
    "first , it is because we do not have high accurate temperature dependent band gaps to fit at very low temperature at present stage .",
    "it may also partly comes from the approximations we made in deriving the temperature dependent pseudopotentials . nevertheless , in this temperature range , the change of exciton energies is very small , and the difference between the experimental values and the theory is very subtle .    we also calculate the fss and the polarization of the mono - exciton at finite temperatures . we find that the fss and the polarization are generally insensitive to the temperature .",
    "for example , the change of fss is usually less than 1 @xmath65ev , and the change of polarization is less than 5 degree when increasing the temperature from 0 to 100 k. this result suggests that the fss can not been tuned using temperature effect .",
    "we develop a temperature dependent empirical pseudopotential theory , and apply it to study the electronic and optical properties of self - assembled inas / gaas quantum dots ( qds ) at finite temperature .",
    "the theory takes the effects of both lattice expansion and lattice vibration into account .",
    "the pseudopotentials correctly reproduce the temperature dependent band gap of bulk iii - v semiconductors such as inas , and gaas , etc .",
    "we find that for the unstrained inas / gaas heterostructure , the conduction band offset increases whereas the valence band offsets decreases with the increasing of the temperature , and there is a type - i to type - ii transition at approximately 135 k. yet , for inas / gaas qds , the holes are still localized in the qds even at room temperature because the large lattice mismatch between inas and gaas greatly enhances the valence band offset .",
    "the single particle energy levels in the qds show strong temperature dependence due to the change of confinement potentials . as a consequence ,",
    "more electron states are confined at higher temperature . because of the changes of the band offsets , the electron wave functions confined in qds increase by about 1 - 5% , whereas the hole wave functions decrease by about 30 - 40% when the temperature increase from 0 to 300 k. the calculated recombination energies of exciton , biexciton and charged excitons show red shift with the increasing of the temperature , which are in excellent agreement with available experimental data .",
    "we expect the theory can facilitate the future device applications of qds",
