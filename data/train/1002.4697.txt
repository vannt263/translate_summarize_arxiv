    "these processes occurs almost instantly .",
    "because the primordial gravitinos decay very rapidly and the reheating temperature is lower than the gravitino mass , the effect to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) scenario @xcite ) may be negligible in our model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the decay modes of particles in this model are considered by using the interaction terms in supergravity lagrangian density , which are as follows : @xmath114\\label{www}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is khler potential , @xmath116 is superpotential , @xmath83 is gravitino , @xmath117 s are fermionic superpartners corresponding to the scalar fields with indices @xmath56 , @xmath118 gauginos , @xmath119 gauge kinetic function and so on @xmath120 s mean the derivatives by scalar fields @xmath121 and finally the covariant derivative in these terms are defined by @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "the interaction terms are obtained by expanding each term included in ( [ www ] ) around the stable points of @xmath66,@xmath67 and @xmath68 . from the first and the second term , the decay modes of the scalar fields @xmath66,@xmath67 and @xmath68 to gravitinos , provided that the modes satisfies the mass condition @xmath124 . from the third and the fourth terms , by replacing the gravitino field with goldstiono @xmath125 which is the helicity @xmath126 component of massive gravitino given by @xmath127 . in our model ,",
    "since the goldstino is identified with @xmath128 , the decays of @xmath129 and @xmath130are possibly occurs . from the fifth and sixth terms , pair productions @xmath131 from @xmath66,@xmath67,@xmath68 , provided that the mass conditions @xmath132 are satisfied .",
    "the seventh and eighth terms gives the decay modes from each scalar to gauginos , adding to the processes @xmath133 , @xmath134,@xmath135 will be possible . finally , from the last term that defines the scalar potential , decay modes @xmath136,@xmath137,@xmath138,@xmath139 can occur , after expanding the scalar potential around the stable points .",
    "we show these varieties of decay modes at table [ decay_modes ] .",
    "+    .decay modes of fields in the model [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath140 + the masses are obtained by our model setting as follows : @xmath141    let us consider the cases of decay modes of @xmath67 , as an example , @xmath142 once decay into @xmath143 and others , further the secondary decay into lighter particles such as @xmath66 and @xmath83 ( also possibly exist the modes directly from @xmath67into them ) , finally will decay into the lightest susy particles ( lsp ) or , the next to lightest susy particles ( nlsp ) and ordinary standard theory particles .",
    "the problems here arise are the effects on the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , which may give rise destruction of nuclei produced by bbn . and",
    "also , provided to identify the lsp are the candidates of the dark matter , the abundance might exceed the observational amount of dark matter .",
    "it is the problem to calculate the yield variables of the lsp s .",
    "there seems , however , exist two problems to calculate the yield variables of lsp . because the decays mainly happen before the equilibrium state of the universe , namely , they are produced in nonthermal processes , it makes difficult to use the ordinary thermodynamical treatments . on the other hand , because the abundance of the mssm , nmssm particles depends on the contributions of @xmath66 and @xmath68 decays and direct decay of @xmath67 , @xmath144 mssm , nmssm particles , it is quite complicate to analyse the amount of lsp particles .",
    "we will tackle with these points in our forthcoming paper.@xcite",
    "the model we used , cleared the @xmath9-problem and appeared to predict successfully the values of observations at inflation era .",
    "it predicted for examples , the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is consistent with the recent observations ; the best fit of seven - year wmap data using the power law @xmath14cdm model is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the spectrum was as @xmath16 , which result matches the measurements as well @xcite .",
    "we have investigated on the preheating mechanism just after the end of inflation through both the inflaton ( dilaton ) decay into mssm gauge sector and the collision of two inflaton into two righthanded sneutrinos . we have concluded in our former paper @xcite that the contribution of both the inflaton decays and the parametric resonance of four body scattering process play equally important roles in the preheating process just after the end of inflation .",
    "the reheating temperature is estimated is about order @xmath3 gev .",
    "because the mass of gravitino is calculated as @xmath4gev , it is rather heavy and may be unstable , therefore , may not be considered as lsp or nlsp and not a dark matter candidate discussed in refs.@xcite . however",
    "the main topic of supergravity at present stage of the theory is whether the gravitino exist or not in nature despite its mass .",
    "it is not reproduced after the reheating of the universe .",
    "the gravitinos are produced almost instantly just after the end of inflation through @xmath1 and @xmath0 , not from inflaton . because the reheating temperature @xmath2 is about order @xmath3 gev , gravitinos",
    "are not reproduced after the reheating of the universe . because the decay time appears very rapid ,",
    "gravitinos disappear before the bbn stage of the universe .",
    "the effects of lsp produced by gravitinos may be important to investigate more carefully , if the lsp s are the candidate of dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , supersymmetry is overwhelmingly broken by @xmath50term of the inflaton ( dilaton ) superfield @xmath10 , that may be contrary to the occurrence of the interchange of ssb fields pointed out in other type of models by nilles et al .",
    "@xcite .    though we have been exclusively restricted our attention to a model of ref.@xcite , the other models derived from the other type of compactification seems very interesting . among them",
    "kklt model @xcite attracts our interest , where the moduli superfield @xmath0 plays an essential roles .",
