    "parametric families of conformal maps in 2d are known to be closely related to long wave limits of nonlinear integrable pde s and their infinite hierarchies .",
    "this observation was first made in @xcite for mappings of slit domains and then extended to mappings of domains bounded by jordan curves in @xcite . in both cases conformal maps from a standard reference domain ( such as upper half plane , or unit disk ) to a domain of a varying shape serve as lax functions of an integrable hierarchy whose flows are identified with variations of the conformal maps described by an infinite set of lax equations . the integrable structures arising in this way are dispersionless kadomtsev - petviashvili ( dkp ) and dispersionless 2d toda ( dtoda ) hierarchies and , more generally , the universal whitham hierarchy first introduced @xcite in an absolutely different context with the aim to describe slow modulations of exact solutions to soliton equations .",
    "the most promising progress along these lines was achieved in geometric and physical interpretation of the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "the key fact , established in @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite , is that variations of domains under the toda flows go exactly according to the darcy law specific for growth processes of laplacian type and viscous hydrodynamics in the hele - shaw cell with zero surface tension ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the dkp hierarchy is simpler than the dtoda hierarchy , its role in the theory of conformal maps and laplacian growth is not well understood .",
    "the connection with conformal maps observed in @xcite gives a geometric interpretation to only rather special ( degenerate ) solutions of the dkp hierarchy which are reductions to systems of hydrodinamic type with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "as is shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , they are related to conformal maps of the upper half plane with slits emanating from the real axis .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the geometric interpretation of the dkp hierarchy is not limited by domains of such special kind .",
    "we show that the same dkp hierarchy is able to cover a much broader class of domains which can be obtained from the upper half plane by removing not just an infinitely thin slit but a whole compact piece ( of a non - zero area and arbitrary shape ) attached to the real axis , which we call a  fat slit \" to stress the analogy ( fig .",
    "1 ) . there is an important difference , however .",
    "the dkp - evolution of usual slits is actually finite dimensional because the slits are to be regarded as arcs of fixed curves @xcite , so only their endpoints can move . in contrast , the dkp - evolution of fat slits ( given by the lax equations ) takes place in an infinite dimensional variety corresponding to changing their shape in an arbitrary way .",
    "let us recall the lax formulation of the dkp hierarchy .",
    "starting from a laurent series [ int1 ] z(p)=p+_k=1^ a_k p^-k one introduces the dependence on an infinite number of  times \" @xmath0 via lax equations [ int2 ] = \\ { b_k(p ) , z(p)}:= - , where the generators of the flows @xmath1 are polynomials in @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 ( polynomial parts of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the dkp hierarchy is an infinite system of nonlinear pde s for @xmath5 s resulting from comparing coefficients in front of different powers of @xmath2 in the lax equations or in an equivalent system of equations of the zakharov - shabat type [ int3 ] - + \\{b_j(p ) , b_k ( p)}=0 for all @xmath6 ( the poisson bracket is defined in ( [ int2 ] ) ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath5 and the times @xmath7 are assumed to be real numbers .    assuming that @xmath8 is a normalized conformal map from the upper half plane onto the exterior of a fat slit",
    ", we show that it obeys equations ( [ int2 ] ) , where @xmath9 are properly defined harmonic moments of the fat slit ( or rather of its exterior ) .",
    "this fact follows from the hadamard formula for variations of the green function with dirichlet boundary conditions . in this sense",
    "the arguments are parallel to @xcite .",
    "evolution in @xmath10 with all other times fixed has an interpretation as a version of the laplacian growth in the upper half plane with fixed real axis .    applying the approach developed in @xcite to the case of fat slits in the upper half plane",
    ", we construct the dispersionless  tau - function \" ( which is actually a limit of properly rescaled logarithm of a dispersionfull tau - function ) of the dkp hierarchy as a functional on the space of fat slits explicitly given by [ int4 ] = - _ ^ | | d^2z d^2 .",
    "it has a clear electrostatic interpretation as coulomb energy of a fat slit filled with electric charge of a uniform density in the presence of an infinite grounded conductor placed along the real axis .",
    "this functional regarded as a function of harmonic moments obeys a dispersionless version of the hirota relation which serves as a master equation generating the whole dkp hierarchy .",
    "consider a compact simply connected domain @xmath11 in the upper half - plane @xmath12 bounded by a non - self - intersecting analytic curve @xmath13 in @xmath12 with endpoints @xmath14 , @xmath15 on the real axis and a segment of the real axis between them .",

    "<S> a  fat slit \" is a compact domain in the upper half plane bounded by a curve with endpoints on the real axis and a segment of the real axis between them . </S>",
    "<S> we consider conformal maps of the upper half plane to the exterior of a fat slit parameterized by harmonic moments of the latter and show that they obey an infinite set of lax equations for the dispersionless kp hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> deformation of a fat slit under changing a particular harmonic moment can be treated as a growth process similar to the laplacian growth of domains in the whole plane . </S>",
    "<S> this construction extends the well known link between solutions to the dispersionless kp hierarchy and conformal maps of slit domains in the upper half plane and provides a new , large family of solutions . </S>"
