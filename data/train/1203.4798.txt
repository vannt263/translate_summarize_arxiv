    "the @xmath0 interaction has received much attention in the literature with work done as early as in @xcite .",
    "the advent of chiral dynamics in its unitarized form , the so called chiral unitary approach , has brought a new perspective to the problem and showed the importance of coupled channels and unitarity @xcite .",
    "one of the novel aspects of these works has been the finding of two poles , and two states , rather than one , associated to the experimental peak of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the two poles stem from a su(3 ) singlet and octet of the chiral dynamical theory .",
    "one pole is around 1390 mev , is wide ( @xmath4 mev ) and couples mostly to @xmath5 .",
    "the other pole appears in all these theories around 1420 mev , is narrow ( @xmath6 mev ) and couples mostly @xmath0 . due to the existence of these two poles",
    "the peak observed in experiment should be different in different reactions , as has been the case in the reactions @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite , which have been analyzed in @xcite and @xcite respectively , and from where evidence was found for a resonance around 1420 mev .    in a recent paper @xcite we reported on the interest of the @xmath9 reaction , which was measured in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the @xmath10 scatters with a neutron , loses energy and can interact with the proton to produce the @xmath2 , which was seen in this reaction in the @xmath5 spectrum . in this way",
    "the production of the resonance is induced by a @xmath10 and this guarantees that the state excited if mostly the one appearing at higher energy and narrow , out of the two @xmath2 states found in @xcite .",
    "one of the conditions for the success of the experiment was to use kaons in flight .",
    "the reason is that the process that shows clearly the resonance peak is the double scattering .",
    "if the kaon is away from threshold , the dominant one body scattering is far away of the resonance region and peaks at higher energies . at lower energies of the kaon",
    ", the peak of the one body collision appears close to threshold and blurs the signal of the @xmath2 coming from double scattering .",
    "more recently we have also shown @xcite that with the dafne conditions , where the kaons come with low energy from the decay of the @xmath11 , one can still see the good signal for the resonance , but on the condition that neutrons are detected simultaneously in the forward direction in the cm , which drastically reduces the background from single scattering .",

    "this is done by noting that the use of chiral dynamics in the faddeev equations has shown that the off shell part of the two body amplitudes , which appears in the faddeev equations and is known to be unphysical , gets cancelled by three body contact terms stemming from the same chiral lagrangians @xcite . in this way",
    "the unphysical part of the amplitudes is removed and only the on shell two body amplitudes are needed in this approach .",
    "these off shell effects are responsible for the differences in the three body calculations that use input potentials producing the same on shell two body amplitudes .",
    "the new method removes these ambiguities and relies upon physical on shell amplitudes . from these perspectives we present here new results for the three body system @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "we calculate explicitly the @xmath15 channel in three body system and we show the result for this process .",

    "our understanding of baryon resonances is undergoing continuous change . from the classical picture of the baryons made out of three constituent quarks , passing through attempts to represent some of them in terms of pentaquarks , to the more recent description of some of them in terms of meson baryon molecules . in this sense , the low lying @xmath37 resonances , @xmath2 , @xmath38 , etc .",
    "can be represented as composite states of meson and baryon , dynamically generated from the meson baryon interaction , and are relatively well understood within the unitary chiral models @xcite .",
    "the low lying @xmath39 domain remains far less understood , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "for instance , quark models seem to face difficulties in reproducing properties of the resonances in this sector @xcite .",
    "the neat reproduction of the low lying @xmath40 states in the @xmath41-wave meson - baryon interaction , using chiral dynamics , suggests that the addition of a pseudoscalar meson in s - wave could lead to an important component of the structure of the @xmath42 resonances .",
    "chiral dynamics has been used earlier in the context of the three nucleon problems , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we present here the study done in @xcite of two meson - one baryon systems , where chiral dynamics is applied to solve the faddeev equations .",
    "as described below , our calculations for the total @xmath41 = -1 reveal peaks in the @xmath43 system and its coupled channels which can be identified with the resonances @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we start by taking all combinations of a pseudoscalar meson of the @xmath50 su(3 ) octet and a baryon of the @xmath42 octet which couple to @xmath51 with any charge . for some quantum numbers ,",
    "the interaction of this two body system is strongly attractive and responsible for the generation of the two @xmath2 states @xcite and other @xmath41 = -1 resonances .",
    "we shall assume that this two body system formed by @xmath0 and coupled channels remains highly correlated when a third particle is added , in the present case a pion .",
    "yet , the formalism allows for excitation of this cluster in intermediate steps .",
    "altogether , we get twenty - two coupled channels for the net charge zero configuration : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "we assume the correlated pair to have a certain invariant mass , @xmath74 , and the three body @xmath75-matrix is evaluated as a function of this mass and the total energy of the three body system . at the end",
    "we look for the value of @xmath76 as a function of these two variables and find peaks at certain values of these two variables , which indicate the mass of the resonances and how a pair of particles is correlated .",
    "the input requires to solve the faddeev equations , i.e. , the two body @xmath77-matrices for the meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions is calculated by taking the lowest order chiral lagrangian following @xcite and using the dimensional regularization of the loops as done in @xcite , where a good reproduction of scattering amplitudes and resonance properties was found .",
    "improvements introducing higher order lagrangians have been done recently @xcite , including a theoretical error analysis in @xcite which allows one to see that the results with the lowest order lagrangian fit perfectly within the theoretical allowed bands .",
    "a shared feature of the recent unitary chiral dynamical calculations is the on - shell factorization of the potential and the @xmath77-matrix in the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite , which is justified by the use of the n / d method and dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can see that the off - shell contributions can be reabsorbed into renormalization of the lower order terms @xcite .",
    "we develop here a similar approach for the faddeev equations .",
    "the full three - body @xmath75-matrix can be written as a sum of the auxiliary @xmath75-matrices @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , are the normal faddeev partitions , which include all the possible interactions contributing to the three - body @xmath75-matrix with the particle @xmath86 being a spectator in the last interaction",
    ". the faddeev partitions satisfy the equations @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is the initial ( final ) momentum of the ith particle in the global center of mass system , @xmath90 is the two - body @xmath77-matrix for the interaction of the pair @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the three - body propagator or green s function , with @xmath93 = 1 , 2 , 3    the first two terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the faddeev equations , for the case @xmath86=1 , are represented diagrammatically in fig.[fig1 ] ,     diagrammatic representation of the terms ( a ) @xmath94 ( b ) @xmath95.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    where the @xmath77-matrices are required to be off - shell .",
    "however , the chiral amplitudes , which we use , can be split into an `` on - shell '' part ( obtained when the only propagating particle of the diagrams , labeled with @xmath96 in fig.[fig1 ] , is placed on - shell ( meaning that @xmath97 is replaced by @xmath98 in the amplitudes ) , and an off - shell part proportional to the inverse of the propagator of the off - shell particle , @xmath99 .",
    "this term would cancel the particle propagator , ( @xmath100 , for example that of the 3rd particle in fig.[fig1]a ) resulting into a three body force ( fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "in addition to this , three body forces also stem directly from the chiral lagrangians @xcite ( fig.[fig2]b ) .     the origin of the three body forces ( a ) due to cancellation of the propagator in fig.[fig1](a ) with the off - shell part of the chiral amplitude , ( b ) at the tree level from the chiral lagrangian .",
    "]    we find that the sum of the off - shell parts of all the two interaction terms of the faddeev series , cancel together with the contribution from fig.[fig2](b ) in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "details of the analytical proof can be seen in the appendices of @xcite .",
    "hence , only the on - shell part of the two body ( chiral ) @xmath77-matrices is needed in the evaluations .",
    "this is one of the important findings of these works because one of the standing problems of the faddeev equations is that the use of different potentials which give rise to the same on shell scattering amplitudes give rise to different results when used to study three body systems with the faddeev equations .",
    "the different , unphysical , off shell amplitudes of the different potentials are responsible for it .",
    "the use of chiral dynamics in the context of the faddeev equations has then served to show that the results do not depend on these unphysical amplitudes and only the on shell amplitudes are needed as input . in this sense , since these amplitudes can be obtained from experiment , it is suggested in @xcite to use these experimental amplitudes , and sensible results are obtained in the study of the @xmath101 system and coupled channels .",
    "the strategy followed in the former works is that the terms with two , three , and four interactions are evaluated exactly .",
    "then it is observed that the ratio of the four to three body interaction terms is about the same as that of the three body to two body .",
    "once this is realized , the coupled integral equations are converted into algebraic equations , which renders the technical work feasible in spite of the many coupled channels used .",
    "the resonances generated for these systems appear as peaks in @xmath76 as a function of @xmath102 , @xmath74 .",
    "a detailed description of all the states that appear in this sector can be seen in @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the results in table [ table1 ] .",
    "one should note that , quite systematically , the widths obtained are smaller then experiment .",
    "this is due to the neglect of the one meson - baryon channels .",
    "the idea is that they have small influence in the wave function , which is largely three - body , but they still contribute to the width because there is far more phase space for the decay .    .@xmath103 and @xmath104 states obtained from the interaction of two mesons and one baryon .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this state is very interesting and it was suggested in @xcite that it could be responsible for the peak around 1920 mev of the @xmath105 reaction @xcite . it was also shown that the spin of the resonance could be found performing polarization measurements which are the state of the art presently .",
    "the two faddeev approaches @xcite lead to binding energies higher than the variational approach , 50 - 70 mev versus around 20 mev binding respectively . the detail mentioned above of an energy independent kernel used in the ags equations is partly responsible for the extra binding of these approaches with respect to the chiral calculations .",
    "indeed , the chiral potential is energy dependent , proportional to the sum of the two external meson energies in @xmath106 . as a consequence",
    ", a smaller @xmath106 amplitude is obtained at lower @xmath107 energies , resulting in a smaller binding for the @xmath1 system .",
    "this numerical result was already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "actually , the same result is found within the approach of @xcite when the energy dependence of the weinberg - tomozawa chiral potential is taken into account in @xcite .",
    "an important step to conjugate the ags equations with the @xmath108 dynamics of the chiral lagrangians has been done , in @xcite .",
    "indeed , two poles are found in qualitative agreement with other chiral approaches .",
    "one narrow pole around 1420 mev , rather stable against changes of parameters , is found in agreement with all findings of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "the second , wider pole , is found at very low energies 1335 - 1341 mev , and more unstable with respect to changes of parameters .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the findings of the chiral unitary approach , but the energy is lower than in other approaches .",
    "one point to try to understand these difference is that in @xcite the @xmath5 mass distribution of the @xmath109 in the hemingway experiment @xcite is adjusted assuming that it is proportional to @xmath110 . yet , as shown in @xcite , when one has two poles , the @xmath111 and @xmath112 amplitudes are rather different and the @xmath2 production processes proceed via the combination of the two amplitudes @xmath113 @xcite .    yet , in most cases the widths are systematically larger than the binding energy , of the order of 70 - 100 mev .",
    "this certainly makes the observation of these states problematic , as acknowledged in all these works . in view of this , the claim in @xcite of a bound state of @xmath114 bound state with 115 mev binding was met with skepticism , and soon it was shown that the peak observed in @xcite was easily interpreted in terms of conventional , unavoidable , reaction mechanisms which were well under control @xcite .",
    "the same was done with the claim of a @xmath115 cluster in @xcite which was also dismissed in @xcite on the grounds that a conventional explanation could be found for it .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors follow the chiral unitary approach for the @xmath116 amplitudes , which provide the most important source of the binding of the three body system , according to the former studies .",
    "but there is also another different technical aspect of that calculation with respect to the former ones .",
    "all previous approaches have concentrated on looking for the binding , searching for poles in the complex plane or looking for the energy that minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "there , inspired by the studies of @xcite , one looks for peaks in the scattering matrices as a function of the energy of the three body system .",
    "these amplitudes could in principle be used as input for final state interaction when evaluating cross sections in reactions where eventually this @xmath117 state is formed .",
    "the findings of the former works simplify our task .",
    "we rely upon the results of @xcite in the sense that only on shell two body amplitudes are needed . by this",
    "we mean the part of the analytical amplitudes obtained setting @xmath118 for the external particles , even if the particles are below threshold .",
    "we also assume , like in the other works , that the two body interactions proceed in l=0 .",
    "according to all the works , the main component of the wave function corresponds to having a @xmath119 in i=0 and hence the total isospin will be i=1/2 .",
    "the total spin can be j=0,1 , but the @xmath120 state is the one found most attractive .",
    "both possibilities are investigated in @xcite .    in the fca",
    "the @xmath1 system is addressed by studying the interaction of a @xmath3 with a @xmath121 cluster .",
    "the scattering matrix for this system is evaluated as a function of the total energy of the @xmath1 system and one looks for peaks in @xmath76 . in a second step one",
    "allows explicitly the intermediate @xmath15 state in the three body system .",

    "is done in @xcite .",
    "a discussion of these different approaches is done in @xcite , where it is shown that refs .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the fca for @xmath122 at threshold was found to be an acceptable approximation , within 20 - 25@xmath124 percent , to the more elaborate faddeev equations in @xcite .",
    "technically we follow closely the formalism of @xcite , where the fca has been considered , using chiral amplitudes , in order to study theoretically the possibility of forming multi-@xmath125 states with large spin .",
    "an interesting shared result of all the @xmath122 calculation quoted above is a large and negative real part of the scattering length , of the order of @xmath126 fm , which suggest the existence of a bound state in @xmath127 .",
    "of course the imaginary part of the scattering length is equally large , anticipating a broad state . we shall be able to make this more quantitative here .",
    "the strategy followed in @xcite is to assume as a starting point that the @xmath121 cluster has a wave function like the one of the deuteron ( we omit the d - wave ) .",
    "latter on one releases this assumption and assumes that the @xmath121 system is further compressed in the @xmath128 system . since in the fca",
    "the input from the @xmath121 system is the @xmath121 form factor , taking into account an extra compression of the @xmath121 systems is very easy by smoothly modifying the form factor to have a smaller radius .",
    "one takes information from previous studies , and in this sense it is interesting to recall that the calculations of @xcite for @xmath129 bound in nuclei point out to a moderate compression of the nucleus due to the strong @xmath130 interaction .",
    "however , in the case of two isolated nucleons the decrease in the radius can be far bigger that in nuclei , where nucleons are already close to saturation density .",

    "we found that the consideration of this reduced @xmath121 size reverted into a larger binding of the three body system .",
    "we have presented here the results for @xmath140 bound state in the fixed center approximation considering charge exchange process , thus , improving on our previous result in ref .",
    "we found a bound state with 9 mev binding and about 30 mev width .",
    "this state was not searched for in the faddeev and variational calculations which concentrated on the @xmath182 , @xmath157 state , which is more bound . in view of that",
    "full faddeev and variational calculations of this @xmath13 state should be most welcome .",
    "the simplicity of the present approach also allows for a transparent interpretation of the results , not easy to see when one uses either a variational method or the full faddeev equations .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath182 , @xmath157 channel could be anticipated once the @xmath0 amplitudes for a @xmath151 belonging to a cluster with @xmath182 or @xmath13 is known .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with results of other methods , which were found with more laborious ways .",

    "<S> this removal of the unphysical off shell part of the amplitudes is most welcome and renders the approach unambiguous , showing that only on shell two body amplitudes need to be used . with this information in mind </S>",
    "<S> we use an approximation to the faddeev equations within the fixed center approximation to study the @xmath1 system , providing answers within this approximation to questions that have been brought before and evaluating binding energies and widths of this three body system . as a novelty with respect to recent work on the topic </S>",
    "<S> we find a bound state of the system with spin s=1 , like a bound state of @xmath3-deuteron , less bound that the one of s=0 , where all recent efforts have been devoted . </S>",
