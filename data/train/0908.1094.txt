    "measurements of the energy spectra of cosmic ray ( cr ) species are of a great importance for understanding the physics of galactic cr sources ( such as pulsars or supernova remnants ) , as well as for constraining the internal structure of milky way , since this structure ( topology and intensity of the galactic magnetic field , profiles and energy distribution of different galactic photon fields , distribution of interstellar gas and dust , etc . ) determines the spatial and energy evolution of the injected charged particles which propagate through the interstellar medium .",
    "in addition , as discussed in several papers by a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , annihilation or decay of a dark matter ( kaluza - klein particles or supersymmetric wimps ) may also imprint some signatures in the observed spectra of cr electrons within the gev ",
    "tev energy range .",
    "consequently , the most recent observations by the atic , pamela , fermi , and hess experiments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) have generated significant interest on this topic in astrophysic and particle physics communities .",
    "the most sophisticated framework for analyzing the cr propagation within the galaxy is provided by the galprop model presented first by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model assumes injection of a power - law electrons and nuclei , and follows their spatial and energy evolution under the influence of different radiative processes ( coulomb losses , synchrotron and ic cooling , proton - proton collisions , etc . ) , taking also into account the relevant interactions of charged particles with the interstellar turbulent magnetic field ( with the assumed kolmogorov spectrum ) in a quasi - linear approximation regime .",
    "the model can successfully explain many findings regarding the hadronic cr spectrum and its composition @xcite , as well as the observed galactic diffuse @xmath5-ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , the model predicts also the decrease of the cr positron - to - electron ratio with particles energy in the gev  tev range , in a disagreement with the observational indications .",
    "this prediction was made under the working hypothesis that bulk of the galactic pairs are created in the collisions of relativistic cr protons with ambient gas , and the subsequent decays of the generated pions ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "one should note that the previous ( prior to 2008 ) measurements regarding this issue were restricted to electron energies @xmath6gev , and as such could be seriously affected by the charge dependence of solar modulation . on the other hand ,",
    "the most recent pamela observations , reaching @xmath7gev energies , confirmed the increasing positron fraction in the cr spectrum @xcite .",
    "the other challenge to the ` standard ' model of cr propagation came from the observations of atic collaboration , which reported a sharp pile - up around @xmath8tev above the power - law spectrum both observed at lower energies but also emerging from the galprop calculations @xcite .",
    "reality of this sharp spectral feature has been questioned by the fermi and hess experiments ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which show a much smaller and broader excess over the best fit power - law continuum @xmath9 .",
    "in this context one has to keep in mind that due to rapid radiative losses of the tev - energy electrons , their spectrum measured in the solar system may be possibly dominated by a few local sources ( most likely nearby pulsars such as vela or geminga ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore may be more complex than a featureless power - law continuum .",
    "in particular , it may reflect the non - stationary and stochastic nature of such sources @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the substructure around @xmath10tev observed by atic was argued to be consistent with that expected from the annihilation of the kaluza - klein dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "both ` local pulsar ' and dark matter scenarios were claimed to successfully account for the increasing positron fraction in the cr spectrum as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , the dark matter interpretation of the atic , fermi , hess and pamela results is of a great interest .",
    "however , in order to fit the collected data in the framework of this model , large though arbitrary ` boost factors ' have to be invoked for the dark matter annihilation / decay fluxes , which are only roughly justified by a possible non - uniform ( clumpy ) distribution of the dark matter near the solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , as shown by @xcite , the dark matter scenario for the positron excess conflicts with the observations of the extragalactic background radiation in the x - ray/@xmath5-ray energy range ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the ` local pulsar ' interpretation also relies on several model assumptions ( regarding particle acceleration in relativistic outflows ) , which are not observationally verified yet .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of explaining the aforementioned data sets by a simple model for the generation and propagation of crs in the galaxy ( and the vicinity of earth ) , without invoking any new / unconventional sources of the tev - energy electrons or positrons .",
    "this scenario is not intended to compete with the complexity of the galprop model . it is intended instead to point out several effects which , even though being standard and at some level inevitable , might have been underestimated or overlooked in the previous analysis .",
    "the new physics involved here is that we emphsize the importance of the klein - nishina ( kn ) suppression of the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering cross section for ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons interacting with the galactic starlight and other photon fields .",
    "we evaluate the modification of the primary electron energy spectrum which results from this new aspect , as well as that of secondary pairs arising from the annihilation of the galactic @xmath5-rays on starlight and from cr proton interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in ",
    "2 we discuss our model and present the kinetic equation describing the propagation of cr electrons ( as well as protons and positrons ) .",
    "we first describe the kn effect qualitatively and then compare the cr electron spectra obtained from detailed solution of the kinetic equation with observations . in ",
    "3 we consider various mechanisms for production of secondary pairs and derive their spectra using the same propagation model , comparing again the resulting spectra with those observed by pamela .",
    "a brief discussion and summary is presented in  4 .",
    "we start this section with the description of the relevant interactions of cr electrons ( accelerated and injected into the galaxy by , presumably , supernova remnants ) with the ism photons ( mainly starlight ) , magnetic field , and turbulence .",
    "we then describe the resultant spectra of these ` primary ' electrons and compare them with the observations reported by atic , fermi , hess , and other experiments .",
    "the propagation of relativistic electrons injected into the ism is determined by two basic interactions : radiative cooling and interactions with plasma turbulence .",
    "the latter causes diffusion in space ( determining the rate of the escape of electrons from the galaxy ) and diffusion in energy ( determining the rate of the acceleration ) . for the electrons with energies above gev ,",
    "the radiative cooling is mainly via the ic scattering on ambient photon fields and due to the synchrotron emission in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the relevant photon fields are the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation with the energy density @xmath11ev@xmath12 , the galactic starlight , and far infrared photons from the dust emission .",
    "the latter two are expected to dominate over the cmb ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) in the inner parts of the galactic disk ( @xmath14kpc from the center ) by a factor of at least a few ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an electron with energy @xmath15 , the characteristic cooling timescale in the thomson ( t ) regime is therefore given as | & & , + & & u_tot u_cmb(1 + ) + b^2 8 . from this one",
    "gets @xmath16yr , which , for the illustrative ( though expected ) galactic magnetic field @xmath17 and @xmath18 , leads to @xmath19myr .",
    "this estimate breaks down at high particle ( and/or photon ) energies where the kn effect reduces the ic cross section .",
    "this happens when the target photon energy in the electron rest frame exceeds electron rest mass , which , in the observer frame , translates to @xmath20ev @xcite .",
    "for the evaluation of the interactions of cr electrons with magnetic turbulence we use the quasi - linear approximation for the particle - wave interactions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and assume a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence as a superposition of magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) waves .",
    "the corresponding spatial diffusion timescale may be estimated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the linear scale of the system and the particle mean free path @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the ratio of energy densities stored in the large - scale ( ` unperturbed ' ) and turbulent magnetic fields , @xmath25 cm is the electron gyroradius , and @xmath26 is the maximum wavelength of the turbulent modes .",
    "this gives @xmath27yr which , for the ism parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30kpc , simplifies further to @xmath31myr .",
    "in other words , an electron with energy @xmath15 travels the distance @xmath32kpc within ism before loosing its energy via radiative cooling ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "hence , high - energy cr electrons ( @xmath34gev ) detected near the earth are supposed to originate from local ( @xmath35kpc ) region and recently operating ( @xmath36myr ) sources @xcite .",
    "it should be noted in this context that several observational findings ( regarding , e.g. , secondary - to - primary ratios of some cr elements ) are better interpreted in terms of the particle diffusion shaped by the ism turbulence characterized by the kraichnan energy spectrum , rather than of the kolmogorov form anticipated above ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . if this is the case indeed , then @xmath37 and @xmath38myr , and hence the conclusion regarding the local origin of @xmath39gev energy cr electrons is even strengthened .",
    "on the other hand , the order - of - magnitude estimate presented above should be taken with caution , because of the uncertainty in the value of @xmath26 , which is not a directly measured quantity , but is only expected to be roughly of the scale of the galactic disk thickness , @xmath40kpc .",
    "in addition , the use of the kolmogorov / kraichnan spectrum for ism turbulence is only partly justified by observations / theoretical models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . finally , the anticipated quasi - linear approximation is appropriate for modeling of the particle diffusion _ along _ the magnetic field lines ( and thus rather _ within _ the galactic disk ) , and is not expected to describe properly the propagation of particles _ accross _ the magnetic field lines ( i.e. , the escape of particles from the galactic disk ) .",
    "the spatial diffusion of cr electrons is accompanied by their diffusion in the momentum space , leading to a net acceleration of particles on the characteristic timescale @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the velocity of turbulent mhd modes in the units of speed of light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a low - beta plasma , the mhd wave velocity is equal to the alfvn velocity @xmath43cms@xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number density of the ambient plasma .",
    "thus , for a kolmogorov spectrum of the ism turbulence @xmath46yr .",
    "assuming again values @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath47kpc , and @xmath48@xmath12 , this simplifies further to @xmath49myr , which indicates that ultrarelativistic electrons undergo little turbulent acceleration within ism before they cool radiatively or escape ( see in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , radiative cooling and diffusive escape are the main processes controlling evolution of cr electrons .",
    "again , in the case of the kraichnan form of the magnetic turbulence , the same ism parameters give @xmath50myr , which is still much longer than the radiative cooling timescale of electrons with @xmath34gev .      in what follows",
    "we assume that cr electrons are injected by numerous sources throughout the ism which has a smooth and slowly varying distribution of gas , photons , and magnetic fields relative to the relevant interaction scales discussed above .",
    "as indicated by the small mean free path calculated above , the electrons undergo multiple scattering before any other interactions so that they acquire an isotropic pitch angle distribution . as a result , for the relevant scales of about few kpc in the vicinity of the earth we can use the homogeneous and isotropic approximation in describing the transport of the cr electrons , where the spatial diffusion can be represented by an overall ( energy dependent ) escape term .",
    "hence , ignoring turbulent acceleration , the propagation of the gev / tev cr electrons within the local ism can be described by the following kinetic equation : [ keq ] n_e(e_e ) t = - e_e - n_e(e_e ) + q_e(e_e ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , where @xmath51 denotes the injection rate of electrons , and @xmath52 the total energy losses timescale .",
    "the steady - state solution to this equation reads as [ solution ] n_e(e_e ) = ( e_e ) e_e _",
    "e_e^ de_e q_e(e_e ) . for a broad ,",
    "e.g. a power - law - type injection function , a very rough but illustrative approximations to this solutions are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where at @xmath55 we have @xmath56 .",
    "note that for @xmath57 and @xmath58 as specified above ( @xmath33 , and @xmath59kpc , roughly the vertical scale of the galactic disk ) one has @xmath60gev .",
    "thus , from the precisely known transport timescales and the observed electron flux @xmath61 one can set direct constraints for the electron injection function @xmath51 .",
    "we note in this context that non - relativistic shock waves associated with galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) are expected to be the primary source of the observed high - energy ( @xmath62gev ) crs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this anticipation seems to be confirmed by the most recent x - ray and @xmath5-ray observations regarding several remnants ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the injection spectrum of cr particles ( both leptons and hadrons ) may be substantially different from the energy spectra of freshly accelerated electrons and ions at snr shocks , due to a complex convolution of particle cooling , transport , and cr - driven magnetic amplification processes in vicinity of non - linear shock waves @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the analysis to the cr electrons not affected by the solar modulation , i.e. the ones with energies @xmath34gev , for which the escape effects can be neglected .",
    "therefore we omit the escape term in the equation  [ keq ] , and obtain [ simpkeq ] n_e(e_e ) = ( e_e ) e_e _",
    "e_e^ de_e q_e(e_e ) , so that for the injected function @xmath63 and @xmath64 the observed electron spectrum will also be a power - law , @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath66 will be required by the observed electron flux @xmath9 .",
    "however , if the dominant electron cooling is due to the ic scattering in the kn regime , the energy losses time scale goes roughly as @xmath67 , which will give rise to @xmath68 .",
    "in other words , _ within the energy range where the ic / kn losses are dominant _ , the steady - state electron energy distribution is expected to pile - up above that expected from extrapolation of the thomson - regime spectrum , as discussed in different contexts by , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite . these kn - related spectral pile - ups are more and more pronounced for flatter and flatter injection continuum . ] .",
    "interestingly , as already noted in the previous section , for the characteristic energy of the starlight photons @xmath69ev ( wavelengths @xmath70@xmath71 m ) , this is expected to happen for @xmath72tev , i.e. within the range of the claimed ` electron excess ' , assuming that the energy density of the starlight emission dominates all the other galactic photon and magnetic fields ( @xmath73 ) . as a result , if the discussed kn effect plays a role , a relatively steep electron injection index @xmath74 is in fact required to account for the observed spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "we now present a more rigorous treatment of the kn effect and show that it may be the primary cause of the observed deviation of cr electron spectrum from a simple power law . for this purpose",
    "we need a more detailed description of the galactic photon fields and of the radiative cooling rate .",
    "we model the galactic dust and starlight emission by the functions @xmath75 similar to the ones given by @xcite , which peak for @xmath76ev and @xmath77ev photon energies with the maximum levels @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , such that the total ( integrated over @xmath80 ) energy densities in these components are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the left panels of figure[lossrate ] show variation with photon energy of the cmb , dust and starlight energy densities for several relative values of these densities . in each panel",
    "we show three curves : for three values of @xmath78 and fixed @xmath83ev@xmath12 ( top ) ; three values of @xmath79 and @xmath84ev@xmath12 ( middle ) ; three values of @xmath85 ( bottom ) .",
    "we also show the energy density of the magnetic field for @xmath86@xmath71 g ( solid horizontal lines ) , and @xmath87@xmath71 g ( dashed horizontal lines ) .    follwing @xcite , we approximate the radiative energy loss timescale for ultrarelativistic leptons as ( e_e ) ^-1 , where the total energy density of the galactic photon fields ( including cmb radiation ) is @xmath88 . here",
    "the kn correction factor is taken to be of the form f_kn(x ) \\ {    ccc ( 1+x)^-1.5 & for & x < 10 ^ 4 + 27 2x^-2(x - 11 6 ) & for & x > 10 ^ 4    . .",
    "in addition , we consider the electron energy losses due to the coulomb collisions and the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the appropriate timescale of these can be approximated as , respectively , ( e_e ) , where @xmath89 @xcite , and ( e_e ) , where @xmath90 is the fine structure constant and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "we note that the above form of @xmath92 includes electron - ion and electron - electron bremsstrahlung assuming completely unscreened limit with @xmath93 fully ionized helium abundance . with such , the total energy losses timescale is _",
    "loss^-1(e_e ) = _ coul^-1(e_e ) + _ brem^-1(e_e ) + _ rad^-1(e_e ) .",
    "the right panels of figure[lossrate ] show the total energy losses timescales ( multiplied by energy ) corresponding to the photon and @xmath94 field energy densities the same as in the left panels , and @xmath95@xmath12 . as evident , at low energies @xmath96gev the coulomb and bremsstrahlung processes",
    "dominate electron cooling , since @xmath97myr and @xmath98myr ( for @xmath95@xmath12 and @xmath99 ) . at higher electron energies ,",
    "the ic / t losses take over .",
    "however , for @xmath34gev the radiative cooling rates deviate from the ones characterizing the thomson regime ( which would be represented by horizontal lines on these plots ) due to the kn effect .",
    "note that these deviations are the strongest in the case of a large ratio @xmath100 .",
    "this is because for dust emission in the far - infrared range , the dominant radiative cooling is still in the thomson regime even for relatively energetic electrons .",
    "therefore , the kn suppression for the optical target photons becomes important only for large values of the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "_ this is exactly the reason why the kn - related features in the cr electron spectrum discussed here may remain unnoticed in the galprop calculations , even though this code includes the exact prescription of the ic cross section , valid in both t and kn regimes .",
    "_    using this radiative loss rate in the simplified version of the kinetic equation ( [ simpkeq ] ) we obtain the energy flux spectrum @xmath101 of cr electrons . for the injection function",
    "@xmath51 we use _",
    "e(e_e ) = k_e e_e^-s_e , with the normalization @xmath102 fixed so that @xmath103_{e_e = 30\\,{\\rm gev } } = 151.4$]gev@xmath104m@xmath105s@xmath44sr@xmath44 , as indicated by the fermi data .",
    "in general , the model outlined above has seven free parameters , namely @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath94 , @xmath45 , and @xmath22 .",
    "however , we fix for illustration @xmath108kpc , @xmath95@xmath12 , and @xmath109tev , so that we are left with only four free parameters @xmath106 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath94 .",
    "we note in this context that the direct measurements of the galactic photon and magnetic field energy densities are difficult due to substantial foregrounds , and thus the associated uncertainties are relatively large ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below we explore the corresponding parameter space of the model .",
    "figure[especs ] shows the energy spectra of primary electrons corresponding to two different injection spectral indices , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and to the same choice of the values of the other three model parameters used in figure[lossrate ] . as evident , the expected kn pile - up effects are indeed present , being the most pronounced for flatter injection continuum , and for large values of the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "the value for the ism magnetic field have little effect on the results , as long as @xmath112@xmath71 g .",
    "one conclusion here is that different combinations of the parameters @xmath106 , @xmath79 , and @xmath78 can lead to the observed electron spectrum @xmath113 .",
    "however , our primary result is that it is relatively easy to account for a possible minor excess in the energy distribution of primary cr electrons over this power law in the @xmath114tev energy range purely by the kn effect .    in figure[creobs",
    "] we compare the observed spectra from various experiments with one of our model calculations corresponding to a choice of model parameters appropriate for the average ( local ) ism conditions , namely @xmath108kpc , @xmath95@xmath12 , @xmath115@xmath71 g , @xmath116ev@xmath12 , @xmath117ev@xmath12 , @xmath118tev , and @xmath119 .",

    "* respectively ) , and fermi ( red ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as evident , with reasonable parametersev@xmath12 , even though considered here as a ` reasonable ' one , is still larger than that expected for the local ism @xcite .",
    "as such , it should be considered as an illustrative model assumption , for which the analyzed kn effects are already of a major importance ( see the related discussion in  3.4 and  4 further below ) . ] _ and the electron injection index the same as required for the galactic cr protons _ , @xmath120 ( see section 3.1 below ) , we can reproduce very well the latest , and most reliable observations by fermi and hess .",
    "it is also clear that the kn effect can not account for the sharp feature claimed by atic observations .",
    "encouraged by this simple and robust explanation for the primary cr electron spectrum , in the next section we also explore the influence of the kn effect on the expected spectra of secondary pairs with the goal of providing explanation of the rise with energy of the positron to electron ratio observed by pamela .",
    "in this section we address the question of the origin and spectrum of ultrarelativistic positrons present in the cr population , which are produced as secondaries in pair production processes .",
    "we consider three different sources of secondary pairs and apply the same transport equation as above to determine their spectra in the ism . from these",
    "we obtain the positron to electron ratio and compare it to the observation by pamela .",
    "the first source of secondary pairs we consider is due to the interactions of ultrarelativistic cr ions ( primarily protons ) with the ambient plasma .",
    "we assume that the galactic sources of crs in addition to electrons inject also ultrarelativistic protons at a constant rate @xmath121 , which then propagate diffusively through the ism and collide with cold protons .",
    "the appropriate timescale for the proton - proton interaction is roughly independent of energy : @xmath122myr for the cross - section @xmath123@xmath124 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the diffusive escape timescale for cr protons is same as for electrons , namely @xmath125myr ( for @xmath59kpc , and @xmath48@xmath12 ) .",
    "this means that cr protons with @xmath126gev are in a slow cooling regime ( i.e. , we are dealing with a thin target case ) , so that the ism proton energy spectrum can be approximated as @xmath127 ( for the kolmogorov turbulence ; see the discussion in section 2.1 and below equation[solution ] ) . keeping in mind the observed cr proton flux @xmath128 , the required injection spectral index should be then @xmath129 .",
    "in addition , in this regime protons escape with most of their energy and only a small fraction @xmath130 of the carried flux goes into production of secondaries ( and neutrinos arising from @xmath4 decays ) and @xmath5-rays ( from @xmath131 decay ) . in particular , one has @xmath132 .",
    "note that if the cr protons propagate through the ism with some particular bulk velocity , e.g. , of the order of the alfven speed , the situation may change .",
    "for example , with @xmath133 one gets @xmath134 independent of the proton energy ( for @xmath135@xmath71 g , @xmath59kpc , and @xmath48@xmath12 ) . in this case",
    "one would expect @xmath136 , requiring thus a steeper injection index of @xmath137 .",
    "independent of which cr proton propagation model is the correct one , the production rate of the secondary pairs will depend on the observed spectrum of the cr protons ( which we assume to be the same throughout the galactic disk ) : [ qepm ] q_e^(e_e^ ) _",
    "pp^-1 n_p(e_p ) f_e^(e_e^/e_p ) , where @xmath138 is the number of pairs with energy @xmath139 produced by a cr proton of energy @xmath140 .",
    "detailed calculations by @xcite show that for @xmath1tev@xmath141pev , the function @xmath138 is strongly peaked for @xmath142 at the level @xmath143 . as a result , the injection function of the secondary pairs should follow the energy spectrum of cr protons , namely @xmath144 .",
    "since the secondary pairs obey the same transport equation as the primary electrons , their spectra can be calculated as discussed in  2 .",
    "in particular , for high energies the escape term ( as well as the coulomb and bremsstrahlung energy losses ) can be ignored giving @xmath145 for @xmath146 . more generally , the expected secondary pair to total electron ratio should vary with the energy roughly as |.n_e^ n_e|_pp & & ( e_e ) 4 j_p ( 14e_e ) j_e(e_e ) + & & 4 ( n_ism ^-3 ) ( u_star ) ^-1 ( e_e ) ^-0.75 , where @xmath147gev@xmath44m@xmath105s@xmath44sr@xmath44 is the observed cr proton flux , and @xmath148gev@xmath44m@xmath105s@xmath44sr@xmath44 is the observed cr electron flux .",
    "the last line in the above equation assumes we are in the thomson regime with @xmath149 so that this ratio becomes @xmath150 with the particular value @xmath151 for the assumed starlight density of @xmath152ev@xmath12 .",
    "this is in a disagreement with the pamela results indicating the fraction increasing with energy up to @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed above , at higher energies we are in the kn regime , where @xmath154 , which will give rise to a flatter energy spectrum of the secondary pairs and hence to @xmath155 .",
    "note also that , since @xmath156 , in regions of low ( high ) radiative field densities the expected fraction will be higher ( lower ) for a given @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "one possibility for increasing the pair fraction in the cr spetrum is to introduce an additional , flatter spectral component consisting solely of the pairs that outnumber the secondaries resulting from the proton - proton interactions .",
    "however , this population can not extend up to @xmath159tev energies , since this would violate the high - energy cut - off measured in the cr electron spectrum by the hess experiment @xcite .",
    "a possible source of pairs that satisfy these requirements may be due to photon - photon annihilation of tev - energy @xmath5-rays on starlight @xcite .",
    "the cross - section for this process has a sharp peak when photon energies satisfy the condition @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the annihilation of @xmath161ev and @xmath162tev @xmath5-ray photons will inject into the ism a relatively narrow energy distribution of pairs at the rate @xmath163 .",

    "however , the question is whether there will be sufficient number of such pairs to account for the pamela observations . in order to address this issue",
    "we use the @xmath167-function approximation for the photon - photon annihilation cross section @xmath168 $ ] @xcite , from which we can calculate the absorption coefficient @xmath169 . if we also approximate the energy density of the soft ( starlight ) photon field by a monoenergetic distribution with total density @xmath170 and energy @xmath171 , namely @xmath172 such that @xmath173 , then the opacity becomes @xmath174 $ ] . from this",

    "proton - proton interactions , in addition to producing secondary pairs , also produce @xmath5-rays ( from @xmath131 decay ) of similar spectrum and comparable intensity .",
    "these @xmath5-rays could be the source of the pairs ( which may be called tertiary pairs ) in the above scenario .",
    "the rate of such ` hadronic ' @xmath5-ray production may be approximated as [ ppgrate ] q_,pp ( _ ) _",
    "pp^-1 n_p(e_p ) f_(_/e_p ) , where @xmath178 is the number of photons with energy @xmath179 produced in a single proton - proton collision involving a cr proton with the energy @xmath140 .",
    "just as in the case of secondary pair production , we refer to @xcite , who showed that in the range @xmath0tev@xmath180pev the function @xmath178 is peaked for @xmath181 at the level @xmath182 .    the total production rate of such tertiary pairs ( with energies @xmath183 )",
    "may be obtained from @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "as before , inserting this in equation ( [ simpkeq ] ) and carrying out the integration , we get the density ratio of tertiary pairs to total electrons at the same energy @xmath15 in terms of the observed cr proton and electron flux ratio , |.n_e^ n_e|_/pp & & 24 _ ^0 ( e_e ) m_e^2 c^4 e_e _ star j_p ( 20 m_e^2 c^4 / _ star )",

    "first , we note that because @xmath175 ( see equation[optdepth1 ] ) the expected number of ( tertiary ) pairs from photo - pair process will be lower than that of the ( secondary ) pairs from proton - proton interaction .",
    "second , because @xmath187 and in the thomson regime @xmath188 , the ratio of photo - pairs to primary electron is independent of the energy density of the soft photon field , as long as it dominates over the other galactic photon fields and the magnetic field .",
    "however , more importantly , this ratio increases with increasing starlight energy as @xmath189 , and ( in the thomson regime ) it increases linearly with electron energy .",
    "therefore , in regions of the galaxy containing high energy ( ultraviolet ) photons and for high energy electrons the photo - pair production may become important and even dominant ( see below ) .",
    "of course , the above result again will be modified by the inevitable kn effect . in this contex",
    "it should be emphasized that because of the flatter injection function of the tertiary pairs resulting from the photon - photon annihilation the kn effect should be more pronounced for them than for the primary electrons or the secondary pairs originating from the decay of @xmath166 due to proton - proton collisions .      yet",
    "another source of @xmath5-rays which may annihilate on the starlight photon field and create additional population is provided by the ic emission of cr electrons themselves . in order to estimate the expected relevance of this process",
    ", we need the rate of production of @xmath5-rays , @xmath190 , which will take the place of @xmath191 specified in the previous section .",
    "the ic rate is related to the ic emissivity @xmath192 as @xmath193 , which can be obtained from the standard relation @xmath194",

    "@xmath195 is the energy of electrons emitting @xmath5-ray photons with energies @xmath179 , while @xmath196 includes only ic cooling due to soft photons of energy @xmath171 .",
    "this gives [ icgrate ] q_,ic ( _ ) = ( e_e , ic _ ) ^2 n_e(e_e , ic ) ( e_e , ic ) , which replaces the photon production rate given above in equation ( [ ppgrate ] ) .",
    "following the same procedure as above we can evaluate the density of @xmath5-rays , the rate of production of pairs @xmath197 , and then the density of pairs in the ism . in the thompson regime @xmath198 and thus @xmath199 for @xmath200 , while in the kn regime @xmath201 .",
    "as we will see below , for relevant cr energies we are closer to the kn regime so we will ignore the factor @xmath202 .",
    "we then obtain |.n_e^ n_e|_/ic & & 4 _ ^0 m_e^2 c^4 e_e _ star _",
    "e_e = 2 m_e^2 c^4/_star   + & & 8 10 ^ -6 ( ) ( u_star ) ( e_e ) where the last line is evaluated for the thomson regime with @xmath203 . as evident , in this regime and for the observed @xmath158 we obtain @xmath204 for @xmath59kpc and @xmath152ev@xmath12 , independent of the soft photon energy .",
    "this implies that the production of tev - energy @xmath5-rays via ic emission of cr electrons  if proceeding in the thomson regime  may dominate over the one resulting from the protons - proton interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the kn effect are expected to reduce the ic emissivity of ultrarelativistic pairs within the consider photon energy range , and therefore both hadronic and leptonic processes may be in fact comparable . for the choice of model parameters appropriate for the average ism conditions , this is not enough to account for the high positron fraction found in the cr spectrum .      as in case of primary electrons",
    "we now carry a more accurate determination of secondary and tertiary pairs by omitting most of the approximations used above",
    ". the production rate of the secondary pairs from proton - proton interactions is now obtained from _",
    "pp(e_e ) = 1 _ e_e d e_p e_p j_p(e_p ) f_e(e_p , e_e ) , where we use the analytic approximation for the function @xmath205 as given in @xcite , and fix @xmath206gev@xmath44m@xmath105s@xmath44sr@xmath44 . for the production rates of ( tertiary ) pairs generated from annihilation of high - energy @xmath5-rays with density @xmath207 by the soft galactic photon fields , we write analogously _ ( e_e^ ) = 4 3 _ t c",

    "finally , for the case of @xmath5-rays resulting from the ic emission of ultrarelativistic cr leptons , we calculate the appropriate photon energy spectrum as n_/ic ( _ ) = 4 c _ j_ic ( _ ) , where the ic emissivity @xmath192 is related to the observed electron flux using the standard ic formulae with the kn effect included @xcite .",
    "we fix this flux as @xmath212gev@xmath44m@xmath105s@xmath44sr@xmath44 ( and cutting - off exponentially at @xmath213tev ) . inserting then the resulting pair production rates in equation ( [ simpkeq ] )",
    ", we obtain the individual and total pair fluxes @xmath214 for all three mechanisms discussed above and for the same seven parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath45 , @xmath22 and @xmath94 used in calculation of the primary electron spectra .",
    "figure[pairs ] shows the energy spectra of secondary leptons produced in proton - proton collisions , @xmath215 ( solid lines ) , and of tertiary pairs produced via absorption of high - energy @xmath5-rays generated in either hadronic or leptonic processes ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , for the same set of parameters used in figure[lossrate ] with same colors , except for the magnetic field set at @xmath218@xmath71 g .",
    "as shown , the cases with a weak starlight but strong dust emission are quantitatively similar to the cases when the dust and starlight energy densities are comparable . only in the cases when the ratio @xmath100 is high , the kn effect flattens the energy distribution of secondary leptons resulting from proton - proton interactions significantly , and only at high ( @xmath219gev ) energies .",
    "in all the above cases , however , the direct pair production in the proton - proton collisions is the dominant source of the positrons , and the contribution of the other two processes ( i.e. , of the tertiary pairs ) to the positron flux is less than @xmath220 except at high energies where it could reach @xmath93 .",
    "the contribution of secondary and tertiary electrons to the observed electron spectrum is even less , being on the order of @xmath221 and @xmath222 for proton - proton and photo - pair processes , respectively .",
    "the above result is illustrated in figure[posit - fract ] , where we compare with different measurements the computed ratio of ( both secondary and tertiary ) positron and electron fluxes , normally denoted in the literature as @xmath223 and @xmath224 , respectively , for the same model parameters as considered in figure[creobs ] ( namely @xmath117ev@xmath12 , @xmath95@xmath12 , @xmath116ev@xmath12 , @xmath115@xmath71 g , @xmath108kpc , @xmath119 and @xmath118tev ) . here",
    "red symbols denote the pamela data @xcite , cyan and blue symbols the heat data @xcite , yellow symbols the caprice data @xcite , and the magenta ones the measurements with the imaging calorimeter @xcite .",
    "as evident , due to the kn effects and inclusion of tertiary pairs the fraction decreases only by a factor of @xmath225 between @xmath226gev and @xmath227gev . even though this is a much less rapid decrease than typically expected ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the pamela results in the high energy ( @xmath228gev ) range can not be reproduced with our conservative choice of model parameters .",
    "the above results show that it would be rather difficult to increase the fraction of secondary pairs just by the photo - pair processes for the average ism conditions .",
    "one needs different conditions for the production of the relatively high positron - to - electron fraction in the cr spectrum which also increases with energy , as claimed by the pamela experiment . in our model ,",
    "those would require increasing the energy density of the starlight emission up to @xmath229ev@xmath12 , and of the ism number density up to @xmath230@xmath12 , keeping at the same time relatively low level of dust emission ( @xmath231ev@xmath12 ) and magnetic field strength ( @xmath232@xmath71 g ) .",
    "figure[pamela ] ( bottom panel ) shows the fraction expected for such a choice of model parameters , which agrees with the pamela data within the energy range not affected by the solar modulation .",
    "the corresponding total electron spectrum is compared with the fermi and hess data in the top panel of figure[pamela ] . as evident",
    "we get again a very good agreement but now we need an even steeper injection spectrum of the primary electrons ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the set of model parameters considered in figure[pamela ] should be regarded as illustrative one only , not necessarily being justified for the local ism .",
    "we note , however , that it corresponds to the optical depth for annihilation of galactic @xmath5-rays formally less than ( though close to ) unity ( see equation[optdepth2 ] ) , and to a small ( @xmath234 ) ratio of number densities of @xmath5-ray photons and cr electrons with the same energy @xmath80 , as required .",
    "in fact , we have |n _ ( ) n_e ( ) j_p(10 ) j_e ( ) ~5 10 ^ -4 ( n_ism ) ( ) ^0.25 ( see the discussion in section 3.2 above ) .",
    "the invoked increased level of the starlight energy density and of the gas number density could be more appropriate around supernova remnants where the injection of the galactic crs is taking place .",
    "hence , the results of our analysis may indicate that ultrarelativistic particles generated in the galaxy undergo most of their interactions near their sources , but propagate much more freely from these regions to the earth ( see in this context recent discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact it may be sufficient if high - energy positrons , but not necessarily electrons , are trapped in the regions characterized by the enhanced photon and gas densities",
    ". there may be even physical justification for such a situation .",
    "for example , cr protons streaming along large - scale magnetic field in the far upstream of supernova shocks with super - alfvnic speed may excite resonant alfvn waves in a form of coherent circularly - polarized cyclotron radiation @xcite . due to the particular helicity of the generated waves",
    ", they will interact with positrons of gyroradii comparable to their wavelenghts ( i.e. , to gyroradii of cr protons generating the turbulence ) , but not with the electrons . as a result",
    ", the electrons will propagate much more freely along the galactic magnetic field to the earth , experiencing the ` average ' ism conditions .",
    "the results presented in figure[creobs ] regarding the observed cr electron spectrum would then be appropriate .",
    "cr positrons , on the other hand , will undergo enhanced scattering in vicinities of their sources resulting in their increased fraction in the observed cr spectrum around @xmath3gev energies , as presented in figure[pamela ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a quantitative description of such a possibility would require different treatment of the positron and electron transport within the galaxy .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the point is , however , that the efficient trapping of tev - energy crs in vicinities of supernova remnants , either charge - dependent or not , may justify the high values for the starlight and gas densities invoked to explain the pamela data in a framework of our model .",
    "let us mention in this context that in the local environments of snrs additional processes may operate leading to an increase in the cr positron - to - electron fraction .",
    "these include enhanced interactions of freshly accelerated cr protons with an intense high - energy photon field of young remnants , generating thus additional secondary pairs via the photo - mezon production process @xcite , or the direct acceleration of secondary pairs injected into the immediacy of snr shocks via @xmath235 collisions @xcite .",
    "yet one more process which may be relevant in the discussed context is the creation of pairs by photons in the electromagnetic field of ultrarelativistic electrons , referred in the literature as a ` triplet pair production ' ( tpp ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this process occurs when the energy of the incident photon in the electron rest frame exceeds 4 times the rest energy of the electron , @xmath236 . for the starlight parameters considered in this paper , namely @xmath237ev ,",
    "this criterium is marginally fulfilled only in the ` head - on ' interactions with the highest energy electrons , @xmath238tev , since only in such a case @xmath239 .",
    "for all the other angles between the direction of an interacting electron and starlight photon , and for all the lower - energy electrons , we have obviously @xmath240 .",
    "nevertheless , the tpp may be of a primary importance if the soft photon energies are higher than anticipated here , say @xmath241ev .",
    "then the head - on collisions of such uv photons with the tev - energy electrons will produce effectively pairs with energies @xmath242tev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. exactly within the energy range of the pamela excess .",
    "note that the energy losses of thus produced pairs should be dominated by the ic scattering deep in the kn regime , and hence the spectral pile - ups discussed in this paper will flatten additionally the injected positron spectrum around @xmath243gev energies .",
    "that is because the tpp cross - section , @xmath244 , exceeds the ic cross section ( due to the kn supression of the latter one ) only for @xmath245 , while the tpp cooling rate exceeds the ic cooling rate only for @xmath246 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if the sources of galactic crs are associated with an intense uv photon field , the most recent pamela results may be possibly explained with much less extreme ism parameters than discussed in this section .",
    "in this paper we show that the observed excesses in the energy distribution of the galactic cr electrons around energies @xmath247tev may be easily re - produced without invoking any unusual source of ultrarelativistic electrons ( or pairs ) , such as dark matter annihilation / decay or some nearby astrophysical object ( e.g. a pulsar ) , other than the general diffuse galactic components of cr electrons and protons injected by supernova remnants .",
    "the model presented here assumes an injected spectrum of electrons ( power - law with index @xmath106 ) and evaluates their observed energy distribution based on a simple and most commonly invoked kinetic equation describing the propagation of cr electrons in the ism .",
    "the main process affecting this outcome is the cooling of the injected electrons by their interaction with the ism photons ( via ic scattering ) .",
    "the interactions of electrons with ism turbulence produces negligible re - acceleration and determines their escape time .",
    "the escape timescale also turns out to be somewhat longer than the cooling time in the relevant range of electron energies .",
    "the new physical effect that is the source of the observed excess is the klein - nishina suppression of the ic cooling rate , which becomes important right around tev energies . with a very reasonable choice of the model parameters characterizing the local interstellar medium ( @xmath248ev@xmath12 , @xmath249ev@xmath12 , @xmath250@xmath71 g , and @xmath251@xmath12 ) we can reproduce the most recent , and perhaps the most reliable observations by fermi and hess , but",
    "not the sharp feature claimed by atic .",
    "interestingly , in our model the injection spectral index of cr electrons becomes comparable to , or perhaps equal to that of cr protons , namely @xmath252 .",
    "the klein - nishina effect will also affect the propagation of the secondary pairs and can produce deviations from a power - law in the observed spectra of such pairs . in particular , it can affect the positron - to - electron ratio .",
    "we have explored this possibility by considering two mechanisms for production of pairs ( and therefore positrons ) .",
    "the first is production of pairs due to the decay of @xmath4 s generated by interaction of cr nuclei with ambient protons .",
    "the second source discussed here is the pair production due to annihilation of diffuse galactic @xmath5-rays interacting with the starlight photon field .",
    "we consider two sources of the galactic @xmath5-rays .",
    "the first is related to the decay of @xmath131 s also produced in proton - proton interactions and the second is due to the ic scattering of primary cr electrons by the diffuse galactic photon fields .",
    "we show that indeed there will be deviations from a simple power - law in the spectra of thus created pairs ( as well as in the positron - to - electron flux ratio ) , similar to the observed one .",
    "however , the relatively high observed positron fraction that increases quite steeply with energy , as observed by pamela , can not be explained by the conservative set of the model parameters used above , which corresponds to the average values expected in the galactic disk .",
    "we can however reproduce the pamela result by increasing the energy density of the starlight photon field and of the ism number density up to the levels @xmath229ev@xmath12 and @xmath230@xmath12 . with these new values we can also fit the fermi and hess data , though with somewhat steeper injected spectrum of the primary electrons than required before ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "the required increased level of the starlight energy density and of the gas number density may be regarded as unlikely for the local interstellar medium .",
    "however , such a choice of the model parameters could be more appropriate around supernova remnants where the injection of the galactic crs is taking place . a possible solution to this problem",
    "may be that crs undergo most of their interactions near their sources , being efficiently trapped thereby by self - generated cr - driven turbulence .",
    "interestingly , such a trapping may be charge - dependent , affecting positrons more than the electrons .",
    "a possible cause of this could be if the dominant crs , namely protons , generate alfvn waves of a particular helicity which scatter and therefore trap positrons more efficiently than electrons in the regions characterized by the enhanced photon and gas densities .",
    "alternatively , higher than considered here energies of photons associated with cr sources may reduce significantly the invoked ` extreme ' values of the model parameters , due to even more severe kn effects and additional ( triplet ) pair production processes expected to occur in an intense uv radiation field .",
    "we note in this context that the qualitatively similar effects to the ones analyzed here for the case of our galaxy have been discussed previously for the case of the host galaxy of nearby radio source centaurus  a by @xcite .",
    "the theoretically predicted isotropic , galactic - scale halo of ultrarelativistic pairs thereby ( with the energy distribution shaped by the kn and @xmath5-ray annihilation processes ) , and in particular the resulting tev emission , has been possibly already detected by the hess instrument @xcite .",

    "<S> recent observations of cosmic ray electrons from several instruments have revealed various degrees of deviation in the measured electron energy distribution from a simple power - law , in a form of an excess around @xmath0 to @xmath1tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> an even more prominent deviation and excess has been observed in the fraction of cosmic ray positrons around @xmath2 and @xmath3gev energies . </S>",
    "<S> these observations have received considerable attention and many theoretical models have been proposed to explain them . </S>",
    "<S> the models rely on either dark matter annihilation / decay or specific nearby astrophysical sources , and involve several additional assumptions regarding the dark matter distribution or particle acceleration . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed excesses in the electron spectrum may be easily re - produced without invoking any unusual sources other than the general diffuse galactic components of cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here assumes a power - law injection of electrons ( and protons ) by supernova remnants , and evaluates their expected energy spectrum based on a simple kinetic equation describing the propagation of charged particles in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the primary physical effect involved is the klein - nishina suppression of the electron cooling rate around tev energies . with a very reasonable choice of the model parameters characterizing the local interstellar medium , </S>",
    "<S> we can reproduce the most recent observations by fermi and hess experiments . interestingly , in our model the injection spectral index of cosmic ray electrons becomes comparable to , or even equal to that of cosmic ray protons . </S>",
    "<S> the klein - nishina effect may also affect the propagation of the secondary pairs , and therefore modify the cosmic ray positron - to - electron ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we have explored this possibility by considering two mechanisms for production of pairs within the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the first is due to the decay of @xmath4 s produced by interaction of cosmic ray nuclei with ambient protons . </S>",
    "<S> the second source discussed here is due to the annihilation of the diffuse galactic @xmath5-rays on the stellar photon field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that high positron fraction increasing with energy , as claimed by the pamela experiment , can not be explained in our model with the conservative set of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we are able , however , to reproduce the pamela ( as well as fermi and hess ) results assuming high values of the starlight and interstellar gas densities , which would be more appropriate for vicinities of supernova remnants . a possible solution to this problem </S>",
    "<S> may be that cosmic rays undergo most of their interactions near their sources due to the efficient trapping in the far upstream of supernova shocks by self - generated , cosmic ray - driven turbulence .     } </S>",
