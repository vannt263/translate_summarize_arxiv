    "the holographic model of superconductors , which is constructed by a gravitational theory of a maxwell field coupled to a charged complex scalar field via anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence , has been investigated extensively in the past years ( for reviews , see refs . @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the emergence of the scalar hair in the bulk ads black hole corresponds to the formation of a charged condensation in the boundary dual cfts .",

    "other attempts to study the holographic superconductor by modifying gravity background can be found in @xcite .    in the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory",
    ", the higher - order correction term also appears in the maxwell gauge field @xcite . besides the curvature correction to the gravity ,",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the high - order correction related to the gauge matter field . in the study of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density",
    ", it was found that the higher derivative correction to the gravity has different effect from that of the higher derivative correction to the gauge matter fields @xcite .",
    "this motivates people to study the effect of higher order corrected maxwell field on the scalar condensation and compare with the effect brought by the correction in the gravity @xcite . considering that the born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite is the only possible non - linear version of electrodynamics which is invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations @xcite , the nonlinear extension on the gauge field described by the born - infeld electrodynamics has been employed in the study on the stability of the bulk spacetime @xcite and its influence on the condensation in cft @xcite .",

    "in this work we have studied a general picture of holographic superconductor .",
    "we have considered high curvature correction in the gravity side and nonlinear correction in the gauge matter field . instead of the probe limit , we have taken the backreaction of classical fields onto the spacetime into account . with the backreaction",
    ", we have obtained the gauss - bonnet born - infeld ads black hole .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamics of this gravitational background in the bulk and examined the condensation of the scalar hair in the boundary cft .",
    "we have obtained the consistent result that the correction in the gravity can make the bulk background more stable and the scalar hair condensation on the boundary more difficult to develop .",
    "this property always holds no matter whether the scalar field is coupled to a maxwell field or a nonlinear electromagnetic field .",
    "furthermore we found that in addition to the neutral ads black hole background , in the more general configuration such as a nonlinearly charged gauss - bonnet ads black hole , the nonlinear correction in the gauge matter field persists the similar effect in the background stability and condensation of scalar field to that of the correction in the gravity side .",
    "the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field can protect the stability of the background spacetime and make the scalar hair condensation hard to form on the boundary .",
    "the consistent effect brought by the corrections in gravity and gauge matter field is different from that observed in calculating the the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in the ads background @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this difference needs to be clarified .",
    "the strength of the backreaction plays the similar role to the corrections in gravity and gauge matter field on the spacetime stability and scalar hair formation .",
    "the consistent influences of the strength of the backreaction and corrections in gravity and gauge matter field have also been disclosed in the effective mass of the scalar field and the conductivity ."
