    "it must have come as a surprise to the physics community when mccrea and milne @xcite derived the cosmological friedmann equations known from general relativity from newtonian mechanics assuming the existence of expansion .",
    "the interest in this derivation has persisted over years @xcite paying attention to refine the newtonian set up and conclusions . in this paper",
    "we go one step further and put forward the question of what kind of modified friedmann equations would emerge if we include quantum corrections to the newtonian potential which , of course , is one of the main ingredients in the newtonian derivation of the friedmann equations .",
    "such corrections have been known for some time @xcite . as we will show below , it is straightforward to repeat the mccrea - milne derivation including these quantum corrections and to arrive at the modified friedmann equations with terms proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the sign of the quantum corrections ( and also on the equation of state ) different quantum effects emerge with one of them resembling qualitatively those of other quantum models .",
    "this similarity consists in the behavior of the scale factor @xmath1 describing a universe which has been contracting in the past , reaching a minimal value of @xmath1 and expanding again after the bounce . for the other sign of the quantum effect ,",
    "the behavior is qualitatively different as the universe spontaneously appears at @xmath2 close to the planck length and starts expanding from this point .",
    "the primary expansion is accelerated reminding us of inflation .",
    "we do not claim that our modified friedmann equations give necessarily the correct description of a quantum universe , but it is certainly worthwhile to consider them . for one",
    "they give the right friedmann equation when no quantum corrections are included and as such could contain the right clues and hindsights when we include the latter .",
    "secondly , we think it is timely to make venture one step more in the area of newtonian cosmologies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief account of the derivation of the standard friedmann equation within the newtonian framework .",
    "next we introduce the quantum corrections and derive the modified friedmann equations . in section",
    "iv we study the behavior of these new cosmological equations varying the sign of the quantum corrections and choosing different equations of state .",
    "there exist different derivations of the cosmological friedmann equation from the newtonian dynamics @xcite and although conceptually such derivations differ @xcite , in the end they all arrive at the same friedmann equations .",
    "we therefore take here the simplest and original point of view which starts by taking into account the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is done by writing @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hubble parameter and @xmath1 is a measure of distance .",
    "the next step considers the total energy for an object ( say , a galaxy ) of mass @xmath5 which reads @xmath6 writing the mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath1 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of the universe , equation ( [ energy ] ) takes the form @xmath9 since @xmath10 and @xmath5 are constants we define @xmath11 and obtain the first friedmann equation @xmath12    to get the second friedmann equation the argument goes as follows : when the volume @xmath13 of the universe expands by @xmath14 , the pressure does work equal to @xmath15 which decreases the energy in @xmath13 by that amount . using energy mass equivalence we one obtains @xmath16 on the other hand",
    "this is the well known conservation law which can be cast in the convenient form @xmath17 if we write the first friedmann equation as @xmath18 by taking a derivative of this equation and replacing @xmath19 from the conservation equation one arrives at the second firedmann equation @xmath20 from our point of view the crucial ingredient is how the newtonian potential enters the derivation .",
    "quantum corrections to the latter are known and it makes some sense to try to re - derive the cosmological equations by taking this correction into account .",
    "several authors have obtained @xmath0 corrections to the newtonian potential by taking gravity as an effective theory and performing one - loop graviton calculations @xcite .",
    "@xmath21\\ ] ] sometimes the results of the quantum corrected newtonian potential is given in a different forms @xmath22\\ ] ] where the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters which take different values depending on the author(s ) .",
    "partly , we can attribute the reason for these discrepancies to the precise coordinate definition used in the calculation @xcite .",
    "the question about the ambiguity of this potential due to the lack of clarity on the coordinates has also been risen in some related articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is argued that a redefinition @xmath25 would change the parameter @xmath23 without affecting the observables .",
    "the general consensus is that we can write the corrected potential as given in equation ( [ hbarn ] ) .",
    "the aforementioned re - parametrization freedom still can not account for all the discrepancies of the different @xmath26 s found in the literature .",
    "a number of errors have been identified @xcite , @xcite , but it is not clear if this accounts for all the different values available .",
    "it is therefore fair to list some of the results ( see table [ table : nonlin ] ) . in the table",
    "we have collected the different values for @xmath27 which also vary in sign ( we will see that the sign plays the most important role in the cosmology derived from these corrections ) .",
    "+   +    .different values of @xmath27 found in the literature . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    having established the quantum correction we can proceed as before .",
    "the total energy receives a new contribution due to the quantum correction in the newtonian potential , i .. e , @xmath28 introducing again the density @xmath8 and the planck length @xmath29 the above equation is equivalent to @xmath30 with the help of ( [ expansion ] ) the first friedmann equation with an @xmath0-correction can be given as @xmath31 the second corrected friedmann equation follows form the faat that the conservation law ( [ work2 ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "we can procced as before to obtain @xmath32 we consider the equations ( [ fh1 ] ) and ( [ fh2 ] ) as the quantum corrected friedmann equations derived withing the framework of newtonian mechanics",
    ". we will show below that they imply a quantum bounce or in other words the initial singularity at @xmath33 is avoided .",
    "for the sake of comparison with other models and a better understanding of similarities and differences between the standard friemdann equations and the equation ( [ fh1 ] ) and ( [ fh2 ] ) we can re - cast the latter in different forms . by re - introducing the cosmological constant @xmath34 and taking an initially flat universe with @xmath35 .",
    "we have then @xmath36 making use of the standard definitions @xmath37 ( provided @xmath4 is non - zero ) and @xmath38 the first friedmann equation ( with the cosmological constant and the @xmath0 corrections ) is simply @xmath39 we could also define a new @xmath40 , namely @xmath41 as well as @xmath42",
    ". then we simply have @xmath43    if we assume the equation of state of radiation the conservation law gives us @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the first friedmann equation becomes @xmath46 with @xmath47 in the case of positive @xmath26 ( positive @xmath48 ) it would make sense to intrduce a critical density @xmath49 such that @xmath50 when @xmath51 . although we will make a detailed comparison with other models at the end of the paper we notice already here that in loop quantum gravity the expression is similar , i.e. , @xmath52 this does not imply that there is quantum bounce only if @xmath26 is positive . indeed , in the next section by solving explicitly the friedmann equations that even in the case of @xmath53 the universe has no singularity at @xmath33 .",
    "different scenarios are possible , mostly depending on the sign of @xmath26 and the equation of state .",
    "some mathematical features of classical and quantum universes are common . in the following steps we will briefly discuss two solutions of the standard friedmann equations without quantum corrections .",
    "first let us consider a toy universe with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath35 filled with radiation .",
    "it is an easy excersise to show that the solution to the friedman equations for @xmath45 reads @xmath56 .",
    "the two branches correspond to @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the branch @xmath59 is decreasing whereas @xmath60 is growing in time ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it would be incorrect to try to avoid the singualrity by gluing the two branches at @xmath61 discarding the rest .",
    "this would lead to an ambiguity in the solution as we would have four possible solutions .",
    "this tells us that we can only glue the two branches if we arrive at a unique smooth solution .",
    "secondly , we take the radiation case with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath62 . due to @xmath63 the hubble",
    "constant can be zero , but this corresponds to a local maximum as we will see .",
    "indeed , the solutions are @xmath64 which we plotted in figure 1 .",
    "there is a restriction on @xmath65 in form @xmath66 and on @xmath1 given us the position of the maximum of @xmath67 .",
    "the latter is @xmath68 making the hubble parameter vanish . in the case of quantum universes",
    "as derived in this paper we will see that @xmath50 will either indicate a local minimum or an absolute minimum .     from the standard friedmann equations .",
    "see the text for more explanation.,width=529 ]",
    "to find out the effect of the new term porportinal @xmath0 in the friedmann equations we start from the energy conservation equation and use first an equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is not to be confused with @xmath27 .",
    "we can solve for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath1 , namely the standard solution is @xmath71 such that @xmath72 . inserting this into the first friedmann equation with @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath73 with @xmath74",

    "this figure displays the solution for the radiation equation of state and negative @xmath48 .",
    "see the text for more explanation.,width=529 ]        figure 2 shows the solutions according to equation ( [ solution1 ] ) . to the right and left of the straight line @xmath61 we have the different branches due to the @xmath82 signs in ( [ solution1 ] ) .",
    "as long as @xmath83 we get always a non - singular universe : the expanding universe starts at a non - zero value @xmath84 ( below the line @xmath85 ) determined by the single - valuedness of @xmath67 .",
    "the mirror universe in such a case is a contracting one ending at the same @xmath2 this is shown in the figure 2 for @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath87 we obtain a singular universe starting at @xmath33 and ending at some @xmath88 following one of the signs ( the other sign gave the mirror collapsing universe starting at @xmath89 and contracting to zero .",
    "the critical point seems to be @xmath90 .",
    "if we choose the solution according to one sign and the single - valuedness of the solution we would end up with two expanding universes , one starting from zero and expanding up to @xmath65 , the other starting from @xmath65 and expanding up to infinity ( a similar picture emerges for the collapsing branch ) . however , these two curves merge smoothly at @xmath65 and therefore we can construct a unique forever expanding universe starting at zero ( and similarly the mirror image ) . we conclude that for negative @xmath48 with @xmath83 the quantum effect is that the universe starts at a finite value of @xmath65 . in section",
    "v we solve these equations by including the cosmological constant .",
    "the next section is devoted to the comparison with other quantum models . in the the last section",
    "we draw our conclusions .",

    "following one branch , i.e. one sign , we conclude that all universe are singular as they start at zero ( or end at zero ) .",
    "we conclude that in order to get a non - singular universe in the case of negative @xmath48 the equation of state plays a crucial role .",
