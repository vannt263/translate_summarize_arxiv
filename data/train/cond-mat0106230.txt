    "the optical properties of ordered cylinder arrays has become a subject of much recent interest mainly because of their potential use as photonic crystals .",
    "@xcite theoretical research once done for spherical particles @xcite has lately been applied to cylinders @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the long wavelength limit the optical properties of a dilute composite of microscopic spherical particles are well described by mean field theories such as claussius - mosotti or maxwell - garnett .",
    "these theories are essentially based on a dipolar approximation assuming that the particles are sufficiently far appart so that it is possible to neglect contributions from higher order multipoles . as particles become closer , however , this approach is no longer valid .",
    "several models have been presented to overcome this difficulty , among wich the theory of normal modes has been shown to be particularly convenient since it makes possible to expand the response of the system in terms of optical resonance terms , where dielectric properties appear separate from geometrical factors .",
    "@xcite the simplest system exhibiting the effects of interactions is a pair of identical particles very close to each other .",
    "a pair of particles of the same material and form but different size is the simplest non - symmetric system of interacting particles @xcite .",
    "recently , a model to study arbitrary cylinder arrays made of the same material has been constructed and applied in detail to a pair of identical cylinders .",
    "@xcite the response of periodic arrays of identical parallel cylinders including proximity effects is also easily treated within that formalism .",
    "the method follows a normal modes description appropriate to the long - wavelength limit first proposed by bergmann @xcite , and makes use of a basis of cylindrical harmonics solutions to laplace s equation .",
    "modes are characterized by depolarization factors and strengths , defined in such a way that an isolated cylinder exhibits a depolarization factor @xmath0 and unit strength .",
    "we here follow a similar procedure to study a pair of non - touching parallel cylinders of the same material but different radii , for different polarizations of the external field .",
    "we show that a difference in radii does not alter the property that depolarization factors are symmetric about @xmath0 , although in contrast with the equal radii case , mixing of transverse and longitudinal modes occurs .",
    "this property is no longer valid when the dielectric function of the cylinders is different .",
    "we find that all normal modes are active for an external field perpendicular to the cylinders axis , whether parallel or perpendicular to the plane containing the axis . modes inactive for identical cylinders have very small strengths when their radii are not very different .",
    "strengths of modes with depolarization factors smaller than @xmath0 are exchanged with those of depolarization modes bigger than @xmath0 , when the direction of the electric field changes from parallel to perpendicular .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we get the multipolar moments and the absorption cross section for a pair of unequal cylinders . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we present and discuss our numerical results . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a set of n parallel , infinite , uncharged cylinders of dielectric function @xmath1 placed in a homogeneous medium of dielectric function @xmath2 , excited by an external electric field whose wavelength is much longer than the cylinder radii or separation between cylinders .",
    "the charge distribution they acquire may be described in terms of individual multipole moments @xmath3 obeying the equations , @xcite @xmath4    here @xmath5 is a positive or negative integer labeling the angular momentum component along the cylinder axes , @xmath6 is a particle index , @xmath7 are the multipolar polarizabilities of cylinder cylinder @xmath8 of radius @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the coefficients in the expansion of the external potential in terms of cylindrical harmonics .",
    "the coupling coefficients are given by , @xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 are polar coordinates in the x - y plane giving the relative position of cylinder @xmath13 with respect to cylinder @xmath8 .",
    "as discussed in reference @xcite , if the cylinders are of the same material one can separate in eq .",
    "( 1 ) terms depending on the material susceptibility @xmath14 from those involving the geometry of the array .",
    "we intend to follow here the same procedure and write eq .",
    "( [ equat ] ) as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 represents the pair of indices",
    "@xmath17 , and @xmath18    note the important feature that matrix @xmath19 depends on geometry only and its eigenvalues @xmath20 define the depolarization factors @xmath21 of the array .",
    "for later convenience we write @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the unit matrix and @xmath24 , so that the depolarization factors @xmath21 and eigenvalues @xmath25 of @xmath26 satisfy the relation ,    @xmath27    because of the property @xmath28 if @xmath29 ( see eq . ( 2 ) ) , we write rows and columns of matrix @xmath26 with indexes @xmath5 and @xmath30 following the sequence @xmath31 , resulting in matrix @xmath32 written in terms of a new real matrix @xmath33 of half its dimension , as @xmath34\\ ; . }   \\label{matrixb}\\ ] ]    from now on we use index @xmath5 and @xmath30 as positive integers , and write the elements of matrix @xmath33 as follows , @xmath35    it can be shown that the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath32 come in pairs with opposite sign @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the eigenvalues of @xmath33 ( see the appendix [ app : repeat ] ) . as follows from eq .",
    "( 7 ) the depolarization factors are then symmetric about the value @xmath38 .",
    "the components of vector @xmath39 can de written in terms of the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath33 and elements of matrix @xmath40 that diagonalizes @xmath33 through    @xmath41    in the case of a uniform electric field @xmath42 parallel to the plane containing the cylinder axes and perpendicular to the latter ( parallel field geometry ) , @xmath43 .",
    "vector @xmath44 is then given by    @xmath45    where    @xmath46    in the case of an electric field perpendicular to the plane containing the cylinder axes ( perpendicular field geometry ) , @xmath47 .",
    "vector @xmath48 is then given by ,    @xmath49    where now    @xmath50    for a pair of unequal parallel cylinders with radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and axis at a distance @xmath53 we define dimensionless parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "because of the properties @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we write rows ( columns ) of matrix @xmath33 with particle index @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) in the sequence @xmath58 resulting in matrix @xmath33 written in terms of a smaller array @xmath59 as follows , @xmath60   \\label{reduce}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the transpose of @xmath59 , and the elements of matrix @xmath59 are given by @xmath62    results for a pair of cylinders with an external field in the parallel or perpendicular configuration can be written in terms of a single normal modes expansion as @xmath63 in this expression the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the parallel ( perpendicular ) configuration , with @xmath64 labelling the excitation modes of the pair as a coupled system .",
    "it gives just half of the multipoles ; the others are obtained from the corresponding symmetry property as given in the paragraph preceding eqs .",
    "( [ xpar ] ) and ( [ xper ] ) .",
    "we have defined the depolarization factors of modes , @xmath65 and coefficients corresponding to strength of modes , @xmath66 we have also defined @xmath67 we find that coefficients @xmath68 satisfy the sum rules @xmath69 it can be shown that , as with the original matrix @xmath32 , eigenvalues @xmath70 of matrix @xmath33 come also in pairs with opposite sign ; therefore the sets of depolarization factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 are identical ( see the appendix ) .",
    "a given depolarization factor exhibits a different strength depending on the direction of the external field . as seen in the normal modes expansion given by eq .",
    "( [ xnormal ] ) the same strength coefficients @xmath68 appear for depolarization factor @xmath73 in the parallel field response and for @xmath74 in the perpendicular field response .",
    "then , strenghts corresponding to depolarization factors symmetric around value @xmath75 are exchanged between responses corresponding to fields parallel or perpendicular .",
    "the magnitude of the electric dipole moment for the pair can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) corresponds to a parallel ( perpendicular ) field .",
    "the absorption cross section is proportional to the imaginary part of the factor accompanying @xmath79 in the previous expression , a quantity we identify as the complex effective polarizability of the pair .",
    "thus we arrive at a normal modes decomposition for the absorption cross section of two parallel cylinders , @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) corresponds to a parallel ( perpendicular ) field .",
    "notice that , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) , the numerator in the previous sum can be written as @xmath83 and is always positive definite . according to the sum rules given by eqs .",
    "( [ sum1 ] ) and ( [ sum2 ] ) , the sum of the numerators in expansions  ( [ moment ] ) and ( [ cross ] ) is @xmath84 , a feature we use in calculating the normalized strength of modes .",
    "we have solved numerically the eigenvalue equation for matrix * b * for the case of a pair of parallel cylinders of radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and have calculated the depolarization factors @xmath85 and strength coefficients @xmath86 according to eqs .",
    "( [ nf ] ) and ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "we have studied in detail the normal modes expansion for the dipole moment of the pair as given by eq .",
    "( [ moment ] ) .",
    "our most important finding is that when the radii are not equal , modes with depolarization factors above and below the value @xmath87 mix for all orientations of the external field .",
    "this is known not to happen when cylinders are equal.@xcite    in obtaining numerical results we use the dimensionless parameters @xmath88 , that measures the center to center distance , @xmath89 , measuring how disimilar the radii are , and @xmath90 , measuring the border to border distance . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum1 ] we plot modes for very close cylinders ( @xmath91 ) with one radius three times bigger than the other ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "modes are for the parallel configuration , while those for the perpendicular case are obtained by mirror reflection about depolarization factor @xmath0 .",
    "note that the placement of modes are symmetric about this central value so that , as far as position is concerned , they are indistinguishable in both configurations .",
    "the figure shows the modes with largest amplitude , while weaker modes accumulate around @xmath93 .",
    "the sum of amplitudes is 10 , as required by the sum rule mentioned after eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) .",
    "labels , included in order to match with labelling in fig",
    ".  [ radii ] , are arbitrary .    figure  [ radii ] shows depolarization factors ( a ) and normalized strengths ( b ) in terms of the parameter @xmath94 , at fixed @xmath95 .",
    "the sum over all strengths is unity , having been normalized by the factor @xmath84 .",
    "thus the results at @xmath92 correspond to amplitudes shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum1 ] with the normalization factor 10 . in changing @xmath94",
    "we keep constant the parameter @xmath96 by changing the center to center distance @xmath53 accordingly .",
    "note that modes with essentially zero strength at @xmath97 become important when increasing this ratio .",
    "labels are arbitrary and are used just to relate the data in different figures .",
    "results shown in fig .  [ radiia ] were obtained by changing @xmath94 and the center to center separation @xmath53 , but keeping constant the border to border distance at the fixed value @xmath98 . in this case",
    "we note that the depolarization factors move appart with increasing @xmath94 , while at constant @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) they get closer . this is because the relation between the edge to edge and center to center parameters is @xmath99 , indicating that as @xmath94 goes to infinity , so does @xmath100 if @xmath96 is kept constant . thus all modes should converge to the isolated cylinder value @xmath101 in this case , while if @xmath100 is kept constant , the modes converge to those of a cylinder in front of a plane at the same distance .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the absorption cross section of a pair of parallel cylinders of the same material but different radii contains modes whose depolarization factors are symmetrically distributed around @xmath0 with amplitudes depending on the direction of the external field . when the field changes from the parallel to the perpendicular configuration , amplitudes corresponding to symmetric depolarization factors about the central value @xmath102 are exchanged .",
