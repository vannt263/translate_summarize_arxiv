    "it is an easy prediction of the fireball model that gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) should show an afterglow , in the x  ray ( vietri 1997 , paper i ) and at optical / radio wavelengths ( mszros and rees 1997 ) .",
    "the energy source powering this luminosity is the kinetic energy of the ( burn out ) ejecta shell after the burst .",
    "this after  glow has become detectable thanks to an exceptional effort by the bepposax science team which has managed to carry out toos just @xmath2 hours after the burst _",
    "grb 970228 _ , and then again about @xmath3 hours later , thus providing the most complete coverage of the post - burst evolution of a grb ever obtained in the x - ray .    by combining observations of the narrow field instruments ( those of the toos ) with both asca and wide field cameras observations , costa ( 1997a )",
    "were able to identify the main features of _ grb 970228 _ as follows .",
    "first , the major burst lasts only @xmath4 ; the afterglow begins just @xmath5 after the major burst , has a time ",
    "dependence @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and the total fluence in the afterglow , as measured in just the @xmath8 band , equals @xmath9 of the whole burst ( including the @xmath10ray fluence ! ) .",
    "i will show in the following that this behaviour can be easily understood within the model of paper i. in particular , i shall show that the afterglow is due to the expansion of a highly radiative relativistic shell of matter , expanding in a constant density environment in the case of _ grb 970228_.    a considerably different time behaviour is displayed by _",
    "grb 970508 _ ( costa , 1997b ) which shows an x  ray luminosity that decays very slowly ( costa , talk delivered at the elba workshop on grbs ; piro , 1997 ) , and simultaneously an optical transient peaking well after the burst ( djorgovski , 1997b ) .",
    "qualitatively this behaviour is easy to understand . since in the afterglow",
    "the dominant emission mechanism , synchrotron , is negligible for frequencies smaller than @xmath11 , the synchrotron turnover frequency , for the optical emission to set in one has to wait for relativistic effects to allow @xmath11 to move into the optical region . at the same time , the x  ray luminosity , which is well beyond @xmath11 , is slow in decreasing .",
    "it thus appears as if the ejecta shell manages to remain relativistic longer than for expansion in a uniform medium ( _ grb 970228 _ ) ; expansion in a surrounding medium with decreasing density will be shown to provide a quantitative , as well as qualitative , explanation for the afterglow of _ grb 970508_.    understanding the behaviour of _ grb 970508 _ seems especially important , in view of the minimum redshift determination of the optical transient ( metzger 1997 ) , which establishes the cosmological nature of grbs : so long as rosat hri observations linking precisely the site of the optical and x  ray transients are not forthcoming , even theoretical arguments linking the two may be valuable .    in the next section , i will discuss qualitative features in _",
    "grb 970228 _ which support the fireball model , while the hydrodynamics and x  ray emission will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "the optical and radio emissions are then discussed in section 4 .",
    "the light curve of _ grb 970228 _ in both the @xmath10 and @xmath12ray bands is peculiar , in that it clearly shows a first peak lasting about @xmath13 , a silence of @xmath14 , and a new , longer peak lasting @xmath15 .",
    "costa ( 1997a ) attributed the second peak to the afterglow .",
    "there are three reasons for setting the second peak apart from the first one : first , the @xmath16 ratio is radically different in the two events .",
    "second , the luminosity of the second peak falls squarely on the extrapolation to early times of the time - dependence law that links the first and second toos to asca data .",
    "third , the x and @xmath10 light curves in the second peak start out nearly simultaneously , suggesting a common origin in a new shock , rather than the beginning of cooling in hot matter .",
    "recognizing the second peak as part of the afterglow implies that the observed afterglow follows accurately a power ",
    "dependence over nearly four orders of magnitude in time and five in flux , without apparently any band effect .",
    "the total soft x  ray ( @xmath8 ) luminosity released in the afterglow can then be integrated to show that it alone equals @xmath9 of the whole burst luminosity ( costa 1997a ) .",
    "since the photon number counts go as @xmath17 , the total correction to obtain the bolometric luminosity must amount to a factor of a few , without changing the order of magnitude of the afterglow fluence . in short",
    ", the afterglow radiates about as much as the burst .",
    "this fact has two important consequences : first , the total energy radiated away by the expanding fireball is large .",
    "thus , the expansion following the burst can not be described by an adiabatic expansion , as was implicitly or explicitly assumed by other authors ( tavani 1997 , waxman 1997a , wijers , rees and mszros 1997 ) , who treated radiative losses as a tiny perturbation to an otherwise adiabatic flow .",
    "quantitative details pertaining to the radiative impulsive relativistic expansion will be derived in the next section .",
    "second , the approximate equality of fluences in the burst and in the afterglow makes it likely that the energy source powering the burst ( the kinetic energy of the ejecta ) is the same as that of the afterglow : if it were otherwise , if the the burst and afterglow were powered by different physical phenomena , an unlikely coincidence would result .",
    "this equality is naturally accounted for in fireball models : when the lorenz factor of the bulk expansion is low ( @xmath18 ) , the reverse shock is only marginally relativistic , and the total directed kinetic energy converted into internal energy , to be radiated as the burst , is @xmath19 of the total energy budget ( sari and piran 1995 ) .",
    "when , viceversa , @xmath20 is large , @xmath21 , the reverse shock is highly relativistic , and the ejcta are stopped dead in their tracks . in this case , the energy fraction converted into internal energy @xmath22 , and the balance remaining as directed kinetic energy @xmath23 , leading to a much weaker afterglow .",
    "this difference may account for the lack of afterglow from _ grb 970111 _ , or its relative weakness in _",
    "grb 970402_.    the following quantitative argument , supporting @xmath18 , can be made .",
    "of the two distinct mechanisms proposed to explain grbs , for this low value of @xmath20 only internal shocks ( mszros and rees 1994 ) can work , the other one , external shocks ( rees and mszros 1994 ) requiring much higher lorenz factors @xmath24 . in the interior case ,",
    "two shells collide and stick at @xmath25 , and from then on they continue a free expansion until they impinge upon the ism , producing a second shock .",
    "this occurs at a radius @xmath26 where the total energy release is @xmath27 , and the ism mass density is @xmath28 .",
    "thus , as seen from earth the time  delay between the first and second shock and ensuing emissions is @xmath29 .",
    "this value is essentially the time ",
    "delay between the first peak of the _ grb 970228 _ , and the onset of the afterglow . also , the simultaneity of the onset of x  ray and @xmath10ray luminositites argues for a common origin in a new shock .",
    "i thus find the internal / external shock model for grbs validated by the observed time ",
    "grb 970228 _ , and the value of @xmath18 supported by observations .",
    "the time  dependence of the soft x  ray flux in a highly relativistic , radiative snowplow model was derived in paper i for late times ( @xmath22 month after the burst ) .",
    "i now derive the prediction for early post  burst times .",
    "the initial burst is contaminated by a baryon mass @xmath30 with @xmath18 ; the shock with the ism occurs at a radius given by eq .",
    "[ shock ] . after this shock ,",
    "the ejecta keep plowing through the ism , shocking ism matter and transforming its directed kinetic energy into internal energy .",
    "assuming the post  shock cooling time to be short ( to be checked later ) , the shocked matter piles up behind the shock in a cold shell , whose lorenz factor @xmath10 , for @xmath31 , evolves according to ( blandford and mckee 1976 ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total mass entrained by the shock , including the initial contamination .",
    "assuming the surrounding matter density to vary with distance from the site of energy release @xmath34 as @xmath35 , it can easily be shown that @xmath36 and the time , as seen from earth @xmath37 , which scales as @xmath38 , varies as @xmath39 which , together , with eq .",
    "[ gamma ] yields @xmath40 where of course @xmath41 the time @xmath42 is the time  scale on which the scale  free solution sets in .",
    "since we are mainly interested in times @xmath43 , i shall from now on neglect the @xmath44 arguments inside the parentheses in eqs .",
    "[ tr ] and [ tempo ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 can also be thought of as a ruse : for @xmath46 , we recover the results for the adiabatic shell .",
    "it should also be noticed that @xmath45 is directly observable , as will be shown in the discussion following eq .",
    "[ turnover ] .",
    "the above solution is correct only for relativistic expansion ; it breaks down for @xmath47 , , at a time @xmath48 @xmath49 which is very weakly dependent on @xmath45 .",
    "the total time through which the shell remains relativistic is thus about a month , as shown in paper i.    the copious fluence in the afterglow phase ( costa , 1997a ) is evidence _ per se _ that the expansion must be highly radiative ; however , this can also be checked through a simple , microphysical argument . for synchrotron emission ,",
    "the synchrotron cooling time in the shell frame is @xmath50 , to be compared with the local expansion time scale @xmath51 .",
    "i find @xmath52 where i used an equipartition magnetic field @xmath53 , and energy equipartition between electrons and protons , @xmath54 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ shock ] and [ gamma ] , i find @xmath55 for a typical explosion , @xmath56 ( piran 1992 ) .",
    "it can thus be seen that , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , while , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , close enough to the limit of validity ( @xmath31 ) of eq .",
    "[ tempo ] to allow us to say that @xmath62 is verified through the whole period in which the shell is relativistic .    in the highly radiative limit",
    ", the total power radiated per unit time is given by a purely hydrodynamical argument ( blandford and mckee 1976 ) .",
    "we have @xmath63 , in the relativistic limit @xmath31 ; in earth time @xmath64 .",
    "i find @xmath65 .",
    "the fraction of all power radiated in the x  ray region , @xmath66 , is computed in paper i as @xmath67 ; here the index @xmath68 is the spectral index of the electron power  law energy distribution , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 fixed by the requirement that the observed spectrum , @xmath71 ( costa , 1997a ) be reproduced .",
    "also , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the upper and lower limits of the bepposax instruments , @xmath74 and @xmath75  kev respectively ; @xmath76 is the maximum electron energy .",
    "proceeding as in paper i , i find @xmath77 . in the end ,",
    "i find @xmath78 where @xmath79 the constant above is computed for @xmath80 , and a source distance @xmath81 .",
    "it varies little with @xmath45 , and given our ignorance of the source distance , it is not worth it to give its ( complex ) dependence on other parameters . since @xmath82 ,",
    "the dependence upon waveband is very weak , explaining why sax can observe such a strikingly extended power  law .",
    "the above discussion allows an immediate fit to the properties of _ grb 970228_. in this case , @xmath68 , and @xmath80 ( constant density ) imply @xmath83 , in excellent agreement with the observed @xmath7 .",
    "this is clearly displayed in fig",
    "_ grb 970508 _ has a different time ",
    "behaviour , showing only a modest decline in flux by a factor @xmath84 from @xmath85 after the burst to @xmath86 after the burst ( piro , 1997 ) ; this corresponds to an average decrease going like @xmath87 . since the spectral properties of _ grb 970228 _ and _ grb 970508 _ seem similar",
    ", we can use the equation above to see that , for @xmath57 , we have @xmath88 , in excellent agreement with observational data .",
    "it should be noticed that these data require a density gradient : for the highly radiative evolution , it was shown above that expansion in a constant density environment leads to @xmath89 , while adiabatic evolution leads to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , the spectral slope of the burst , is most likely similar for _ grb 970228 _ and _ grb 970508_.",
    "one may think at this point that the introduction of a declining density into which the fireball plows is but a simple minded way to account for the slowly declining x  ray flux , but i show here that this stratagem simultaneously explains why the optical luminosity is seen increasing , yielding quantitative predictions in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "typical spectra of grbs are of the form @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , with @xmath96 but very ill  determined , and @xmath97 . since the equipartition magnetic field @xmath98 , the turnover frequency as seen from the earth @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , so that @xmath101 . the electron density in the shell frame @xmath102 , and the comoving shell thickness @xmath103 , so that the comoving intensity @xmath104 , and the observed flux as a function of observer time is @xmath105 ( wijers , rees and mszros 1997 ) . from the above eqs .",
    "[ tr ] and [ tempo ] i find @xmath106 , where @xmath107 .",
    "so long as @xmath11 is shortward of the optical region , the optical luminosity is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 . for @xmath110 and @xmath57 ,",
    "i find @xmath111 , but ill  determined because of the uncertainty on @xmath112 .",
    "once @xmath11 has entered the optical region , the luminosity must then decrease according to @xmath113 for @xmath57 , @xmath114 , for @xmath115 . the optical data from table i are shown in fig .",
    "2 , corrected for standard galactic absorption and for a spectral shape @xmath116 .",
    "they show clearly that both the rise ( less significantly ) and the decline ( more significantly ) agree with the model for @xmath117 .",
    ".optical fluxes of _ grb 970508_. time is measured from burst trigger , may 8.904 ut ( costa , 1997b ) . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     this model not only predicts that the optical luminosity should first increase and then decline , but it also reproduces correctly the time ",
    "delay between the beginning of the afterglow and the onset of optical emission .",
    "if the emission is pure synchrotron , there will be a minimum electron energy given approximately by @xmath118 in the shell frame , emitting synchrotron photons at the turnover frequency @xmath119 , with @xmath120 given by the usual equipartition argument @xmath121 . in the earth frame , this frequency is given by @xmath122 as the shell decelerates , @xmath11 will enter the optical region , @xmath123 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath124 , independent of all burst parameters except for the very weak dependence upon the density of the surrounding medium . from eq .",
    "[ tempo ] , @xmath125 is reached at a time @xmath126 given by @xmath127 . introducing numerical values , i find , for @xmath128 , @xmath129  days , in agreement with the observed @xmath130 ( djorgovski , 1997b ) . in the case of _ grb 970228 _ instead",
    ", corresponding to @xmath59 , i find @xmath131 , well before the detection of the optical transient ( van paradijs , 1997 ) , and thus in agreement with observations .",
    "[ turnover ] is quite remarkable : not only does it show but a weak dependence upon the surrounding matter density and no other dependence upon burst luminosity , distance or beaming angle , it also tells us that , by mapping the times of flaring of the burst at different wavelengths , one can determine the time  dependence of the shell expansion , eq .",
    "[ tempo ] .",
    "thus the hydrodynamics of the problem at hand is , at least potentially , directly amenable to testing .",
    "it can easily be seen from eq .",
    "[ turnover ] that the turnover frequency can not possibly have entered the radio region within the @xmath132 time lapse within which the source was seen to flare ( frail , 1997 ) , so that it seems reasonable that this radio flaring is due to the source becoming optically thin . the optical depth below the turnover frequency for @xmath133 , scales as @xmath134 , due to the presence of a flat , most likely thermal , energy distribution of electrons ( tavani 1996 ) . the optical depth at the turnover frequency @xmath11 can be computed approximately from the high frequency limit ( @xmath95 ) as @xmath135 from which we find that the frequency which is becoming optically thin at any given time , @xmath136 is given by @xmath137 the scaling has been chosen so to show that the detection of frail ( 1997 ) , at @xmath138 a mere @xmath139 after the burst is correctly reproduced .",
    "also , the corresponding expected flux level , @xmath140 , is given by @xmath141 fortuitously close to the observations of frail 1997 , of @xmath142 .",
    "it should also be noticed that the inverted spectrum observed , @xmath143 , which is so important in ruling out the hypothesis that the burst be due to a blazar , is characteristic of a radio source caught in the process of becoming optically thin .",
    "an alternative and comprehensive model accounting for several properties of the afterglow of _ grb 970508 _ has been presented by waxman ( 1997b ) , who postulates that the expansion is adiabatic .",
    "this makes the observed radiation small with respect to the afterglow energy , with the balance of this energy going into adiabatic losses ; in fact , he postulates large ( @xmath144 ) energy releases .",
    "there are two observational major differences between his model and the present one . first , in waxman s model",
    ", the slow decrease of the x  ray luminosity can not be accounted for : in fact , inverse compton scattering ( waxman 1997a ) is incapable of decreasing the number of photons ( and thus the x  ray luminosity ) produced by synchrotron radiation , because it is well  known that the total optical depth to thompson scattering in grb ejecta shell is very small , @xmath145 ( sari , narayan and piran 1996 ) . thus the model should show the same time  dependence of the x  ray luminosity as _",
    "grb 970228 _ , which it does not ( piro , 1997 ) .",
    "second , since in his model the cooling time is long compared to the local dynamical time  scale , waxman ( 1997b ) expects an x  ray spectrum going as @xmath146 , while i expect @xmath147 , exactly like in the burst proper .",
    "thus spectral observations will be able to tell whether the expansion is adiabatic ( the x  ray spectrum is harder in the afterglow , waxman 1997b ) , or highly radiative ( afterglow and burst having similar spectrum , this paper ) .      * the x  ray afterglow luminosities of both _",
    "grb 970228 _ and _ grb 970508 _ are well  fitted by the deceleration of a radiative relativistic shell , plowing through external matter ; in the first case , a constant density allows a good fit , while in the second one a power  like density distribution @xmath148 , like that left over by a prior mass loss episode , is required ; * the delay ( @xmath14 ) between the first peak and the onset of the afterglow , in the x and @xmath10 emission of _ grb 970228 _ is quantitatively explained by assuming that the first peak results from an internal shock , and the afterglow from an external shock ; * the existence of a delay between the optical luminosity maximum and the @xmath10 peak in _ grb 970508 _ can most easily be explained by expansion in a nonuniform external medium , thus strengthening the interpretation of the x  ray light curve ; * the optical time ",
    "delay for _ grb 970508 _ is well reproduced as @xmath149  days ; * the late appearance of the radio flux , the observed flux level , and the peculiar inverted spectrum are all easily accounted for in this model .",
