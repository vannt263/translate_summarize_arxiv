    "an extended hubbard model is generally employed as a theoretical framework of screened electronic interactions and regarded as a prototypical scenario for rich quantum phases in condensed matter physics@xcite . in a one - dimensional chain , for instance , an extended hubbard model , including an on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions , presents correlated phases associated with the ratio of the two interactions@xcite .",
    "recent indentification of the bond - charge - density - wave instability between charge and spin density - wave phases , at weak and strong interactions , completes the phase diagram of this model@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in a two - leg ladder , a checkerboard charge - ordered state has been proposed for all fillings between quarter and half , with on - site and nearest - neighbor repulsion@xcite .",
    "its application to the coupled quarter - filled ladders with coupling to the lattice has recently been studied@xcite to explain the spin gaps in the nav@xmath6o@xmath7 material@xcite .    on a two - dimensional lattice ,",
    "the extended hubbard model has been considered a paradigmatic model to search for possible unconventional superconducting phases since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "although a nearest - neighbor repulsion between electrons suppresses non - s - wave pairings tendencies@xcite , it is generally believed that the nesting of the fermi surface plays a key role in driving unconventional pairing under purely repulsive interactions at weak couplings@xcite . in the proximity of density - wave order ,",
    "for instance , a chiral @xmath8-wave state has been found for an extended hubbard model on both triangular and honeycomb lattices@xcite .",
    "furthermore , following the recent experimental realization of a two - dimensional kagome lattice for ultracold atoms@xcite , the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model on a kagome lattice has been established in the vicinity of van hove fillings@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a possible @xmath9-wave charge and spin bond order can be triggered in the presence of a nearest - neighbor repulsion for van hove fillings , then giving way to a @xmath10-wave superconducting phase when slightly doped away@xcite .",
    "it has recently been proposed that under a nearest - neighbor attraction and on - site repulsion a singlet @xmath11-wave pairing emerges on a honeycomb lattice@xcite .",
    "along with the result that majorana fermions can be generated as a zero - energy mode in the excitation spectrum of a half - quantum vortex in a @xmath11-wave superconductor@xcite , this indicates the possibility of creating majorana fermions in graphene in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , a functional renormalization group study has shown that for a honeycomb structure , the @xmath10-wave pairing is preferred and is stabilized by introducing a next - nearest - neighbor attraction@xcite .",
    "although triplet @xmath9-wave superconductivity has been proposed for an extended hubbard model on a square lattice for purely repulsive interactions@xcite , the physics of long - range interactions , with possibly terms leading to competing instabilities , has been studied recently , leading that the existence of @xmath9-wave pairing is still an open question@xcite .    in this paper , we study the phase diagram of an extended hubbard model via a functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach@xcite , including on - site @xmath0 and nearest - neighbor @xmath1 interactions , on a two - dimensional square lattice .",

    "the leading instability can be determined by the most minimum eigenvalue @xmath43 ( largest magnitude ) , and the corresponding symmetry of the instability is given by the form factor @xmath44@xcite .    at half - filling , the phase diagram has been studied extensively by several methods@xcite . in our frg analysis",

    "for the line of @xmath21 and @xmath47 , we find that cdw and @xmath17-sc are degenerate , also in agreement with results in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , the degeneracy is delicate and broken by introduction of a nearest - neighbor interaction : a slight nearest - neighbor attraction drives the system to a @xmath17-sc instability , instead of a cdw instability .",
    "we also find that for a sufficiently large nearest - neighbor attraction , a @xmath5-sc is triggered , even dominant over the @xmath17-sc in the regime of @xmath47 .",
    "this @xmath8-wave pairing is linked with the nesting of the fermi surface . in other words , if the nesting effect is suppressed , the @xmath17-sc is the dominant instability for a generic fermi surface in the regime of @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , without nesting effects , a @xmath9-wave , with lower angular momenta than @xmath8-wave , will eventually dominate in the regime of @xmath26 and @xmath23 .",

    "[ doped]d .",
    "although the @xmath3-sc phase has been proposed for the purely repulsive models@xcite , the @xmath3-sc instability we find develops only with an appropriate nearest - neighbor repulsion and also tied with the proximity to nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "it is only when nesting is barely suppressed so that cdw is no longer dominant , but cdw fluctuations are still expected to be strong , that this @xmath3-sc phase emerges .    as compared with the phase diagram at @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ doped]a , the @xmath3-sc instability moves to the region of larger positive @xmath1 or negative @xmath0 when doping is increased , for @xmath48 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ doped]b . by looking at the rg flows of different couplings",
    ", we notice that the different behavior for the two fillings , @xmath28 and @xmath48 , are mainly coming from the effect of the nesting vertices , that is , couplings @xmath50 with @xmath51 or @xmath52 or @xmath53 . for @xmath48 , there are fewer nesting vertices flowing into large values as compared with the @xmath28 case . without the benefit of nesting vertices ,",
    "the instability of @xmath3- and @xmath5-sc are suppressed and eventually do not develop by the time we stop the rg flow . as a consequence , when the nesting is completely destroyed , in heavily doped cases , there is no instability found for purely repulsive interactions ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ doped]c .",
    "the triplet @xmath9-sc phase tells an opposite story . in the regime of @xmath26 , under the influence of fermi surface nesting , @xmath5-sc is dominant , as shown as fig .",
    "[ doped]a .",
    "however , decreasing nesting suppresses the @xmath8-wave pairing and the @xmath9-sc emerges for large nearest - neighbor attraction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ doped]b .",
    "when the nesting is no longer present at all , @xmath9-sc dominates the regime of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , as illustrated as fig .",

    "the emergence of a triplet @xmath9-sc has a clear physical picture in a square lattice . in the presence of a nearest - neighbor attraction @xmath26 ,",
    "electronic pairings are triggered .",
    "to lower energy , a @xmath17-wave pairing with the lowest angular momenta would be favored .",
    "however , an on - site repulsion suppresses the @xmath17-wave pairing so that @xmath9-wave , with the second lowest angular momenta , is preferred .",
    "furthermore , the four - fold symmetry on a square lattice also indicates that the @xmath54- and @xmath55-wave instability channels must be degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy of two @xmath9-wave superconducting instabilities is indeed found in our frg results and the associated form factors are plotted in fig .",
    "[ doped]e .",
    "since the @xmath54- and @xmath55-wave superconducting states are degenerate , the gap functions will be given as a linear combination of the two order parameters . by constructing the gap function as @xmath56 with the complex coefficient @xmath57 containing a possible relative phase ,",
    "the condensation energy in the standard bcs equation is obtained by the difference in energy between the superconducting and normal states , and is given by @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the dispersion relation of the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) is maximized when @xmath57 is purely imaginary , hence the time - reversal breaking pairing symmetry @xmath60 is the energetically favored one@xcite .",
    "physically this is reasonable , since this choice of the phase guarantees that a gap forms everywhere along the fermi surface , lowering the ground - state energy .",
    "in atomic bose - fermi mixtures , an effective attraction between fermions can be mediated by fluctuations of the bose - einstein condensate of the bosons@xcite . in the presence of the mediated long - range attraction",
    ", the @xmath60 wave superconducting state has been proposed in these systems@xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism discussed here puts some constraint for the emergence of the @xmath60-sc phase : in order to develop the @xmath60-sc , long - range attraction and on - site repulsion is needed , as well as low density of fermions to avoid nesting of the fermi surface , while large enough densities such that the fermi energy is a large scale ( @xmath61 ) to justify the validity of frg results .",
    "another possible way to manifest a mediated attraction is through another species of fermions in a fermi - fermi atom mixture@xcite . by introducing an inter - species interaction in fermi - fermi mixtures , an effective interaction for one species of fermions",
    "can be obtained by tracing out the other species .",
    "this can be justified , for example , if the one of the species has a much smaller effective mass than the other . in this case@xcite",
    ", the mediated long - range interaction is found to decay rather rapidly and can be approximated by an effective on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions . by tracing out one species with low electronic density",
    ", an effective nearest - neighbor attraction can be obtained .",
    "together with a bare hard - core on - site repulsion , it may provide the required conditions for the creation of the time - reversal breaking @xmath60-wave pairing .    in conclusion",
    ", we study the phase diagram of an extended hubbard model , including a on - site @xmath0 and nearest - neighbor @xmath1 interactions , on a two - dimensional square lattice . in the proximity of charge - density - wave order",
    ", the @xmath3-sc overcomes the cdw , dominating in the regime of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , from our frg analysis .",
    "accompanying the destruction of fermi surface nesting , a time - reversal breaking @xmath4-wave superconducting state arises in the regime of @xmath26 .",
    "our results indicates that , without nesting , the @xmath4-sc on a square lattice under a nearest - neighbor attraction is the generic behavior due to the underlaying lattice structure , and can be used to create a zero mode majorana fermion in the presence of a magnetic field .",
