    "in addition , since electrons produce bremsstrahlung photons which penetrate deeper in the atmosphere , compared to primary particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and produce ionization there , it is important to use adequate modelling of their production and propagation .    in this work the propagation of precipitating electrons and their interactions with atmospheric molecules , leading to production of secondary particles , is modelled using the geant4 based @xcite simulation tool planetocosmics @xcite . here",

    "it gives detailed information about the secondary particle flux at a selected observation level and the energy deposit , explicitly considering particle attenuation .",
    "the planetocosmics also allows simulation of a purely electromagnetic cascade in a realistic manner .",
    "we have computed the ionization yields ( response function ) i.e. the number of ion pairs produced per gram of the ambient air at a given atmospheric depth by a single primary precipitating electron with a given energy .",
    "the computations were carried out in the energy range between 50 kev and 500 mev .",
    "an example of ionization yields for several energies of primary electron is given in fig.1 .",
    "the ionization yields @xmath1 given as ion @xmath2 , which corresponds to the atmospheric depth @xmath3 , is defined as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the mean energy loss in the atmospheric layer @xmath6 centred at the atmospheric depth @xmath3 per one simulated primary electron with the kinetic energy @xmath7 , and @xmath8=35 ev is the average energy needed to produce one ion pair @xcite .",

    "in addition , significant fluctuations , specifically in a low energy range , of ionization yields are observed in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of about 90 km a.s.l .",

    "the crac : epii model predicts slightly more ions , specifically at the depth of maximum ion production . the observed difference in the maximum is of the order of 35 - 40 @xmath16 . the level of maximal ion production by crac : epii is at slightly lower altitudes compared to parametrization model .",
    "in addition , the contribution of bremsstrahlung photons to ionization is clearly seen at altitudes of about 30 km above the sea level .",
    "we achieve a satisfactory agreement with parametrization in the integral energy deposit .",
    "the observed difference in the region of maximum ion production is due to a combination of various processes related to the complex high - energy electron propagation confined by the monte carlo model as well as the different atmospheric model assumptions . in general a good agreement between the two models",
    "is achieved , specifically in the upper atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the crac : epii demonstrate very good ability to assess ion production by high energy electron precipitation .",

    "in addition , compared to direct simulation models , it is more flexible ( specifically for operational purposes ) , because it is based on a widely used , simple for application formalism of precomputed ionization yields .",
    "we note that the present results show good agreement with a monte carlo model based on satellite measurements , aimos @xcite , which is based on geant4 @xcite ( private communication with j. wissing during the issi workshop on `` specification of ionization sources affecting atmospheric processes '' )",
    ". the direct comparison of these two models based on the same platform would be in practice a comparison of different atmospheric profiles resulting in particle transportation and/or different code versions , but not comparison of different models .",
    "a detailed study of various atmospheric profile parametrizations and/or hadron generators within a same platform ( tool ) is discussed elsewhere @xcite and it is beyond the scope of this work .    the application of crac : epii model for estimation of ionization yields demonstrates good agreement with a recent analytical parametrization model .",
