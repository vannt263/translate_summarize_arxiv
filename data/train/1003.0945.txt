    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems containing a white dwarf and a roche - lobe filling normal star .",
    "they have several subclasses , such as , dwarf novae ( dne ) , nova - like variables , novae , and magnetic cvs ( @xcite ) .",
    "cvs are considered to be one of the final stages of the evolution of low mass binaries .",
    "the formation and evolution of low mass binaries can be explored through the orbital period ( @xmath3 ) distribution of cvs ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "stable mass - transfer processes in cvs are driven by angular momentum removal from the binaries . in short period cvs having @xmath4  hr , the driving mechanism is considered to be angular momentum removal associated with gravitational radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a cv evolves toward a short-@xmath3 region by losing angular momentum .",
    "this phase is terminated when the core of the secondary star becomes degenerate .",
    "then , the degeneracy pressure changes the mass  radius relationship of the secondary star . as a result , the cv evolves toward a long-@xmath3 regime after passing through the minimum @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution near @xmath5 has received attention , since the observed @xmath3 distribution has different characteristics from that expected from theoretical studies .",
    "it is well known that @xmath5 is @xmath6  min in the observed cv population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the theoretically predicted @xmath5 is 6070  min , significantly shorter than the observed value ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is the so - called `` period minimum problem '' . according to population synthesis studies , most cvs",
    "have already passed through @xmath5 .",
    "it has been proposed that the evolution time - scale is long for an evolutionary - advanced system with a low mass secondary star , in other words , the mass - transfer rate ( @xmath7 ) from the secondary star is low ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", a spike - like feature is expected to appear near @xmath5 in the @xmath3 distribution due to the accumulation of systems",
    ". however , the observed distribution is rather flat .",
    "this is the so - called `` period spike problem '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is known that there is a `` missing '' population in the observed cvs with a @xmath3 range of 7080  min when compared with the predicted population . @xcite",
    "have recently reported three cvs having a brown dwarf secondary , which are candidates for the missing population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery indicates that cvs can actually reach the post-@xmath5 regime as predicted by the theories , while the number of such systems is still not properly known .",
    "it has been suggested that the problems can be reconciled by another mechanism of angular momentum removal in addition to gravitational radiation ( @xcite ) , such as the effects of magnetic stellar wind braking ( @xcite ) , the circumbinary disk ( @xcite ) , and a combination of magnetic propeller and accretion disk resonances ( @xcite ) .    on the other hand , it is possible that the missing population exists , but remains undiscovered . according to the disk instability model for dne ,",
    "the recurrence time of superoutbursts ( supercycle ; @xmath8 ) is longer in a system with a lower @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "wz  sge - type dne are known to have long @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , which indicate a low @xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that several wz  sge stars , or cvs with a low @xmath7 have remained undiscovered because of their low activity ( @xcite ) . since wz  sge stars are found concentrating in a short @xmath3 regime , these objects are a candidate for the missing population ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , their intrinsic contribution to the whole cv population has been poorly understood because their @xmath8 were uncertain and their quiescent luminosity is low .",
    "@xcite have recently reported that the cv sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database shows a period spike feature in the @xmath3 range of 8086  min .",
    "the spike feature is a consequence of deep images and a homogeneously selected cv sample obtained by sdss , which could detect intrinsically faint cvs with a low @xmath7 .",
    "recently , in addition , @xmath8 of several wz  sge stars have been well determined owing to long monitoring of dne by amateur observers ( e.g. @xcite )    in this paper , we investigate the contribution of long-@xmath8 dne to the whole population of cvs by estimating their intrinsic population . in  2 , we demonstrate that the whole population of cvs has changed significantly due to a recent increase of the number of short @xmath3 cvs . in  3",
    ", we estimate the population of dne by considering the detection probability of superoutbursts using bayesian analysis .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results to the study of cv evolution in  5 . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "both the period minimum and spike problems arise from the discrepancy between the @xmath3 distribution predicted by the population synthesis studies and the observed one . in previous studies , the predicted distribution",
    "was occasionally compared with the distribution of all known cvs .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : rk ] shows the @xmath3 distribution of all known cvs with @xmath10 discovered before 2003 ( black ) and 2008 ( white ) .",
    "the samples were selected from ritter & kolb catalog : http://www.mpa - garching.mpg.de / rkcat/@xmath11 184 sources in rkcat 7.0 for the 2003 sample and 312 sources in rkat 7.9 for the 2008 sample . both magnetic and non - magnetic cvs",
    "are included in the samples . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "the fraction of short-@xmath3 systems in the 2008 sample is apparently larger than that in the 2003 sample .",
    "we applied the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test to evaluate whether the two samples differ significantly .",
    "we calculated ks probabilities , @xmath12 , from the 2003 and 2008 samples , and also from the 2003 sample and 128 new sources discovered between 2003 and 2008 .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : kstest ] .",
    "the test for the 2003 samples and the sample of new sources gives a low probability of 0.07 , and based on this we conclude that the distributions of the samples differ significantly . for the test with the full 2008 sample , the probability is also low at 0.73 and hence it must be concluded that the 2003 and 2008 samples differ overall .",
    "the difference between the samples is also clear in the normalized cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) of the 2003 sample and the new sources in the 2008 sample , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : rk ] .",
    "these results demonstrate that the @xmath3 distribution of all known cvs has significantly changed recently .",

    "first , outbursts of new and known wz  sge stars have routinely been discovered recently and hence the number of known wz  sge stars has rapidly increased ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dramatic increase of newly recognized su  uma - type and wz  sge - type dne is also apparent in tables in @xcite , in which 14 wz  sge - type dne ( out of a total of 32 systems ; @xcite ; @xcite ) was recognized after 2005 .",
    "this increase of the outburst detection is attributed to the development of automatic sky monitor systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; and most recently , @xcite ) , and improvements in the techniques and instruments of amateur observers ( notably by k. itagaki ) .",
    "the development of online networks for transient phenomena has also played an important role in circulating information on wz  sge stars , and enabled timely observation essential for identifying their nature ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , large spectroscopic surveys have also played an important role in increasing the number of cvs recently , for example , sdss and the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those large surveys allow us to investigate the @xmath3 distribution without complicated observation bias which should be considered in a sample containing all cvs discovered by various detection methods .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution of all known cvs would be same as before if the distribution of those new cvs is same as that of the previously known cvs . however , the distribution of the sdss cvs has a period spike feature , and is different from the previously known distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is evident that the period minimum and spike problems should be discussed not with the sample containing all known cvs , but with the sample in which observation bias for the @xmath3 distribution can be simply evaluated . in the next section",
    ", we collect outburst - selected dn samples , and estimate the intrinsic population of dne without the complicated bias for the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "as well as new wz  sge stars , outbursts of known wz  sge stars have been observed routinely .",
    "thereby , we can now estimate @xmath8 more accurately for them . in @xcite (",
    "hereafter , paper  i ) , we revised @xmath8 of several dne and found that wz  sge stars form a major group in @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that a dn enters the wz  sge regime on an evolutionary course at @xmath17 as @xmath7 decreases . using @xmath8 and @xmath3 from paper  i",
    ", we consider a statistical experiment to estimate the intrinsic @xmath3 distribution of dne from observed systems based on a simple model for @xmath8 .",
    "using bayesian analysis , we calculate the posterior distributions of parameters that characterize the @xmath3 distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a dn sample , @xmath18 , whose superoutbursts were detected at least once in a certain period of time .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath3 population of dne can be reproduced from this outburst - selected sample if @xmath8 can be described with a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of observed dne , @xmath19 , is given by the intrinsic period distribution , @xmath20 , and the selection effects arising from the observation process , @xmath21 , in the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a normalization factor .",
    "with a parameter set , @xmath24 , that characterizes @xmath25 , the likelihood of @xmath26 , can be defined by @xmath27 posterior distributions of parameters , @xmath28 , are estimated with bayes theorem , as follows : @xmath29 in our analysis , we used flat distributions for the prior probabilities of parameters : @xmath30 .",
    "samples were selected from su  uma - type dne in rkcat7.9 .",
    "the `` asas '' sample consists of systems in which superoutbursts were recorded at least once in the asas-3 database between 1 jan 2003 and 31 dec 2007 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a superoutburst is defined as an outburst lasting for @xmath31 with a small fading rate ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath3 of our sample was limited to @xmath33 because our simple model of @xmath34 can not reproduce the features of a period gap of 2  hr @xmath35 3  hr ( for details , see the next section ) .",
    "we made another sample , called the `` mixed '' sample , using the procedure for data selection as for the asas sample , but using both the vsnet and asas-3 databases for searching superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "we excluded two minor groups of objects in the shortest @xmath3 regime .",
    "the first group is er  uma stars ( er  uma , ix  dra , rz  lmi , v1159  ori , and di  uma ) , which are characterized by atypically short @xmath8 ( 2050  d ) despite a short @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other group was identified in paper  i for the first time and called `` group  x '' .",
    "the members of this group have rather average @xmath8 ( @xmath36  d ) despite a short @xmath3 .",
    "these two groups were excluded from our sample because they may lead to an overestimate of the intrinsic population of short-@xmath3 systems having long @xmath8 .",
    "we obtained 42 and 146 sources for the asas and mixed samples .",
    "the asas sample is expected to be an ideal sample without complicated selection effects since the superoutbursts were detected through a single observation process defined by the asas system .",
    "the mixed sample may be affected by complicated selection effects .",
    "we calculated the ks probability of both samples .",
    "the obtained probability is unexpectedly high , @xmath37 , which means that there is no significant difference between those two samples .",
    "this implies that our method of data selection has the advantage of reducing selection bias .",
    "the @xmath3 distributions of these two samples are shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath3 distribution , @xmath25 , must be characterized by at least two parameters , namely , one for the degree of accumulation near @xmath5 and the other for the real @xmath5 .",
    "we express @xmath25 by the following formulae : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a parameter for the degree of the accumulation near @xmath5 .",
    "these are the parameters of our bayes model , that is , @xmath40 . a large @xmath39 yields a distribution with a prominent spike near @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution becomes flat in the case of @xmath41 . for a negative @xmath39",
    ", the distribution has a peak in the long-@xmath3 region .",
    "the function @xmath25 has an extremum at @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is a normalization factor . while this formula of @xmath25 itself has no physical meaning , it can approximate the profile of the @xmath3 distribution below the period gap predicted by population synthesis studies , with high @xmath39 ( @xmath44 ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this model should be used only below the period gap ( @xmath45 ; @xcite ) , since it can not reproduce the gap structure .",
    "we considered a simple model for the selection effect , @xmath34 .",
    "first , we considered that all the systems are pre-@xmath5 cvs and neglected contributions from post-@xmath5 cvs .",
    "the contribution of post-@xmath5 cvs to our analysis is discussed in  4.2 .",
    "second , we used a proposed model for the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath3 based on observations . in paper",
    "i , we showed that most systems are ordinary su  uma stars in a @xmath46 range of @xmath47 .",
    "the average @xmath8 is 470  d in @xmath48 . on the other hand , in the shortest @xmath3 regime of @xmath49 ,",
    "the major group is wz  sge stars .",
    "based on these results in paper  i , we assumed the following for our model , @xmath34 : i ) @xmath8 is constant at @xmath50 in @xmath51 .",
    "ii ) @xmath8 becomes longer with shorter @xmath3 in @xmath52 .",
    "iii ) we set @xmath53 .",
    "the outburst detection probability , @xmath54 , is inversely proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "taking @xmath54 at @xmath55 to be unity , the above assumptions can be expressed as follows : @xmath56 the parameter @xmath57 can be estimated from the observed @xmath8 listed in table  5 of paper  i. using gw lib ( @xmath58  min and @xmath59  d ) and sw uma ( @xmath60  min and @xmath61  d ) , for example , we obtained @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we show @xmath54 calculated from the observed @xmath8 of our sample with @xmath63 in figure  [ fig : doutb ] .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure denote the models , @xmath54 , with various @xmath57 .",
    "this figure shows that the estimation of the parameters with gw  lib and sw  uma yields a lower - limit of @xmath57 for our sample . as discussed in   4.1 , a larger @xmath57 leads to a larger number of short-@xmath3 dne . in the following analysis",
    ", we used @xmath64 , which gives a firm lower - limit for @xmath57 , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : doutb ] .",
    "@xmath57 can be smaller than 2.0 only when @xmath65 .",
    "we check whether our estimation of @xmath57 is consistent with the results of the analysis in   4.1 .",
    "finally , we considered the relationship between the absolute magnitude , @xmath66 , at supermaximum and @xmath3 . since the asas sample is a magnitude - limited sample , the selection bias caused by the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath66 should be corrected . under an assumption of a uniform space distribution of dne",
    ", the number of detectable systems , @xmath67 , can be written as a function of @xmath66 as @xmath68 @xcite reported the relationship between @xmath66 at normal outburst maxima and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to their relationship , @xcite proposed that wz  sge stars have a constant @xmath66 , independent of @xmath3 .",
    "we follow their models for @xmath66 at the supermaxima of ordinary su  uma stars ( @xmath69 ) and wz  sge stars ( @xmath70 ) , that is : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant determined by @xmath73 .",
    "the unit of @xmath46 is hour .",
    "the constant @xmath74 is not important in our analysis .",
    "we calculated the likelihood of the sample using equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "we produced posterior probability distributions of @xmath39 and @xmath77 using the markov chain monte carlo method ( mcmc ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation procedure of mcmc is as follows : at the @xmath57-th step of mcmc , we obtain the likelihood , @xmath78 .",
    "we then randomly move to another point in the parameter space of @xmath39 and @xmath5 by adding random values drawn from a gaussian distribution which has zero mean and dispersion chosen to efficiently sample the likelihood surface . as a result , we obtain @xmath79 .",
    "we count the parameters of the @xmath80-th step if @xmath81 or @xmath82 is larger than a uniform random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath57-th parameters are substituted for the @xmath80-th ones . after discarding the first 100 steps , we sample every 100 steps until the size of the sample reaches @xmath83 . this cycle forms a set of samples for @xmath39 and @xmath5 .",
    "we obtained ten sets of samples with different initial values of @xmath39 and @xmath5 .",
    "we confirmed that the obtained ten samples had the same @xmath3 distribution .",
    "we merged them and finally obtained the posterior distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : post ] shows the posterior distributions of @xmath39 ( left panel ) and @xmath5 ( right panel ) .",
    "each panel contains both the results estimated from the asas and mixed samples .",
    "the median and 68.3% confidence level of @xmath39 and @xmath5 are summarized in table  [ tab : post ] and are also indicated in the figure . as expected from the ks test in   3.2 , the parameters estimated from the asas sample agree with those from the mixed sample within the errors .",

    "short-@xmath3 systems in @xmath84 account for 59  % of the total number of samples between @xmath85  min .",
