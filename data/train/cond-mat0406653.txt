    "in comparison to ordinary metals metallic heavy fermion systems have remarkable low - temperature properties @xcite : both the conduction electron specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility can be two or more orders of magnitude larger than in normal metals though the ratio of both quantities is similar to that of usual metals . usually , in metals an increasing resistivity @xmath4 with increasing temperature is observed .",
    "in contrast , a much richer behavior is found in heavy fermion systems : at higher temperatures @xmath4 only changes slightly and might even increase with decreasing temperature . below a characteristic coherence temperature a strong decrease of the resistivity with decreasing temperatures is observed . at very low temperatures , a @xmath5 dependence of the temperature",
    "another important finding is that a correspondence between the low - energy excitations of heavy fermion systems and those of a free electron gas with properly renormalized parameters can be established .",
    "therefore , the high density of states at the fermi surface observed in heavy fermion systems implies an effective mass of the ( heavy ) quasiparticles which is some hundred times larger than the free electron mass .",
    "prototype heavy fermion systems like ceal@xmath6 and upt@xmath6 contain rare - earth or actinide elements .",

    "in summary , in this paper we have applied a recently developed projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) to the periodic anderson model ( pam ) in the limit of infinitely large coulomb repulsion at @xmath13 sites . by using an additional factorization approximation we have derived renormalization equations for the parameters of the hamiltonian . in this way",
    ", the pam is mapped to a free system consisting of two uncorrelated quasiparticle bands .",
    "similar uncorrelated hamiltonians have been also derived before by different theoretical approaches , such as the gutzwiller projection @xcite and the sb theory @xcite where @xmath29 expansions have been exploited . in contrast , the present approach is valid for any @xmath0 . due to the factorization approximation certain expectation values enter which prevent a direct numerical evaluation of the renormalization equations . in principle , the expectation values could be determined self - consistently by deriving additional renormalization equations also for the operators which enter the expectation values .",
    "this has not been done in this paper .    to obtain instead an analytical solution we have used a renormalized @xmath13 level which was assumed to be constant during the renormalization process .",
    "the spirit of this approximation is similar to that used in the sb theory @xcite .",
    "we obtain self - consistent equations for the renormalized _ f _ level @xmath2 and the averaged _ f _ occupation @xmath182 which are quite similar to those of the sb theory @xcite . in particular , in the limit @xmath229 our solution perfectly agrees with the sb result but strongly differs from it for smaller values of @xmath0 . to compare our results in more detail with those of the sb approach",
    "we have also considered an one - dimensional pam with a linear dispersion relation of the conduction electrons and a @xmath128 independent hybridization .",
    "note that the character of the obtained two quasi - particle bands of the two treatments differ . whereas the quasi - particles of the sb theory change their character as function of @xmath128 from a more @xmath13-like to a more @xmath154-like behavior and vice versa the excitations of the prm treatment do not change their character .",
    "instead , the quasi - particle energies show jumps as function of @xmath128 where , however , the various parts of the quasi - particle bands fit perfectly together . the influence of the degeneracy @xmath15 has been studied by varying @xmath15 with fixed @xmath230 . whereas the sb results are almost unchanged ,",
    "our analytical results show a remarkable dependence on the degeneracy @xmath0 .",
    "especially , serious deviations are found for small values of @xmath0 .    finally , from a more technical point of view , note that in in this paper the prm method was applied to a physical system for the first time without using any perturbation theory .",
