    "weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) of distant galaxies is determined by the total matter overdensity along the line of sight . in more technical terms ,",
    "weak lensing measures the matter power spectrum weighted with a function that depends on the geometry of the lens - deflector - observer system .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the wl signal for a given set of cosmological parameters , one needs to be able to accurately calibrate the matter power spectrum @xmath0 .    the sensitivity of weak lensing surveys peaks at scales of about 10 arcminutes on the sky , corresponding to intervening structures of size @xmath2 at redshift @xmath3 , which is approximately where the lensing efficiency of distant galaxies peaks ( e.g.  jain & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the scales probed are _ nonlinear _ and need to be calibrated by n - body simulations .",
    "unfortunately , one can not afford to restrict the measurements to linear scales for which there are accurate analytical predictions ( and which corresponds to scales @xmath4 deg .  at @xmath5 ) , since the information from large scales only is poorly constraining due to cosmic variance ( e.g.  huterer 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , accurate calibration of the fully nonlinear matter power spectrum @xmath0 is necessary to ensure that the cosmological parameter determination from weak lensing surveys is not compromised .",
    "current accuracy in the matter power spectrum at mildly nonlinear scales is about 5 - 10% ( white & vale 2004 ; heitmann et al . 2004 ) which is sufficiently small for current surveys ( for reviews of weak lensing , see e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 , van waerbeke & mellier 2003 , refregier 2003 ) .",
    "however , the accuracy will need to be better for future wide - field surveys .",
    "the accuracy and agreement of various n - body simulations is rapidly improving and the currently popular fitting formulae for the power spectrum ( e.g.  ma et al .  1999 ,",
    "jenkins et al .",
    "2001 , smith et al . 2003 ) will soon be insufficiently accurate and flexible and one will need to resort to a full suite of n - body simulations , interpolating on a grid of cosmological models ( and thereafter , perhaps , building a new set of more flexible and accurate fitting formulae ) .    in this work we consider the requirements of future deep , wide - field wl surveys such as dark energy survey , panstarrs , supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ; aldering et al .",
    "2004 ) and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "for the fiducial model we assume sky coverage of 1000 sq . deg . with 100 galaxies per arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "we vary these numbers later to determine the robustness of our results to survey specifications .",
    "we assume a flat universe with matter energy density relative to critical @xmath7 , dark energy equation of state @xmath8 , and power spectrum normalization @xmath9 .",
    "we use the spectral index and physical matter and baryon energy densities with mean values @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the parameters whose future accuracy can most benefit from future wl surveys are @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and we pay particular attention to these three .",
    "we do not add any priors whatsoever , since we are considering the efficacy of wl surveys in their own right ; moreover , we have checked that reasonable priors ( for example , those based on expected accuracies from the planck experiment ) have minimal effect on the three aforementioned parameters and all of our results .",
    "note that we do not consider the time variation in @xmath14 since the best - measured mode of an arbitrary @xmath16 is about as well measured as @xmath17 ( huterer & starkman 2003 ) , and it is this particular mode , being the most sensitive to theory systematics , that will drive the accuracy requirements .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider the constant @xmath14 case . throughout",
    "we consider lensing tomography with 10 redshift bins equally spaced between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and use the lensing power spectra on scales @xmath20 . over this range of multipoles , statistical properties of the lensing fields",
    "are nearly gaussian and , furthermore , complex baryonic effects that are expected to be significant on smaller scales are strongly suppressed ( e.g.  white 2004 , zhan & knox 2004 ) .",

    "we find that the model error in @xmath0 causes the suppression of the lensing power spectrum amplitudes by @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "since a given angular mode @xmath21 corresponds to smaller @xmath49 as redshift increases , the lensing spectra of higher redshift bins arise from density perturbations of smaller @xmath49 and are therefore less affected by the numerical effects .",
    "the shaded region shows the 1@xmath105 statistical error in the lensing spectrum measurement for the fiducial survey , where the error arises mainly from the cosmic sample variance at @xmath106 , while the shot noise due to the intrinsic ellipticities is dominant at larger @xmath21 .",
    "the departures in the lensing spectra of low redshift bins are larger than the statistical errors even though we only consider the measurements at @xmath107 .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate how the numerical inaccuracy in @xmath0 propagates into the biases in cosmological parameters , and we address this in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bias ] . as with the statistical error in @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : pk_prior ] ) , the biases in @xmath0 lead to a larger bias in @xmath15 than those in @xmath108 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the simulations with @xmath109 and @xmath99 , which are feasible with current numerical resources , lead to the bias in @xmath14 and @xmath108 of less than about 20% relative to the marginalized error .",
    "moreover , in the future one can expect to be able to calibrate , and partly correct for , the remaining bias in simulations by using a small number of even higher resolution simulations as a reference .",
    "the effect of baryons on the non - linear mass clustering is another potentially harmful systematic effect on @xmath0 ( white 2004 , zhan & knox 2004 ) and its calibration requires hydrodynamical n - body simulations that include baryon dissipation .",
    "baryons , which constitute more than 10% of the total mass , cool and condense within a halo , and their effects are most pronounced for halos of mass @xmath110 ( white 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath111-ray observations indicate that the hot baryons are likely to have a smoother profile than dark matter .",
    "zhan & knox ( 2004 ) estimated the effect of hot baryons on the lensing power spectrum assuming an isothermal @xmath75-model to describe the density profile of the baryon within the host halo .",
    "their fiducial model leads to modifications in the lensing power spectrum of a few percent around @xmath112 for source redshift @xmath113 ( see figure 2 in their paper ) .",
    "this effect is of similar amplitude as that shown in figure [ fig : bias ] , suggesting that the presence of hot baryons does not necessarily lead to drastic biases in the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , a much more extensive investigation that uses a suite of hydrodynamical simulations is needed to properly assess the effect of baryons on cosmological parameter estimation",
    ".      the most damaging systematic error in calibrating @xmath0 will generally be error that mimics the behavior of cosmological parameters .",
    "somewhat confusingly , however , the worst - case biased @xmath0 ( call it @xmath114 ) is typically _ not _ the matter power spectrum for some neighboring values of cosmological parameters . for , @xmath114 is weighted with the geometric factor to produce the observable convergence power spectrum , and the geometric factor is known exactly ( provided that the redshift distribution of galaxies is known ) . instead",

    "we also consider the systematic biases in the power spectrum in n - body simulations . while the simulations accuracy is already nearly sufficient , the cooling and collapse of baryons , and even the clustering of massive neutrinos ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) may lead to large errors if they are not modeled accurately .",
    "there exist a number of options to protect against such effects ( huterer & white 2004 ) , but exploring those is beyond the scope of this work . the most stringent accuracy requirement on @xmath0 is obtained for the worst - case scenario where the bias in @xmath0 conspires to produce the convergence power spectrum that is precisely reproduced by cosmological parameters with biased values .",
    "fortunately , we find that even this worst - case scenario leads to tolerable biases in the cosmological parameters provided @xmath0 is calibrated to 0.5 - 1% accuracy over the relevant scales .",
    "note too that , in order to achieve @xmath129% accuracy in @xmath0 , current analytic fits for the _ linear _ power spectrum are not accurate enough either , and one instead needs to numerically solve the coupled einstein , fluid and boltzmann equations as done e.g. in the cmbfast code ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "as we are entering the era of powerful wide - field wl surveys , currently popular fitting formulae for the power spectrum will soon become inadequate and one will need to resort to a full suite of n - body simulations , interpolating on a grid of cosmological models .",
    "first steps in such an approach were recently undertaken ( white & vale 2004 ) although many details remain to be worked out .",
    "we have shown here that the required accuracy is nearly within reach with current simulations , although the number of models that are necessary to be run might be very large . with the effort of the weak lensing community and ever - more powerful computers",
