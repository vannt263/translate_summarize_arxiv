    "after the first discovery of cosmic acceleration from the distance measurements of the supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) @xcite , the existence of dark energy has been also supported from other observational data such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , such a late - time cosmic acceleration is problematic because of the huge difference between the observed dark energy scale and the expected value of the vacuum energy appearing in particle physics @xcite . along with the cosmological constant @xmath9 ,",
    "many alternative acceleration mechanisms have been proposed , including modifications of the matter / energy content and large - scale modifications of gravity ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 is constrained by measuring the expansion rate of the universe from the observations of sn ia , cmb , and bao @xcite .",
    "although it is possible to rule out some accelerating scenarios from the analysis of the cosmic expansion history alone , we require further precise observational data to clearly distinguish between models with subtly - varying @xmath8 .",
    "so far the @xmath9-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath9cdm ) model has been consistent with the data , but there are many other dynamical models such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , and @xmath10 gravity @xcite which are compatible with current observations .",
    "the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution provides additional important information to discriminate between different dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the galaxy clustering occurs due to the gravitational instability of primordial matter density perturbations .",
    "the growth rate of matter perturbations can be measured from the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) of clustering pattern of galaxies .",
    "this distortion is caused by the peculiar velocity of inward collapse motion of the large - scale structure , which is directly related to the growth rate of the matter density contrast @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence the rsd measurement is very useful to constrain the cosmic growth history .",
    "recent galaxy redshift surveys have provided bounds on the growth rate @xmath11 or @xmath12 in terms of the redshift @xmath13 , where @xmath3 and @xmath5 is the rms amplitude of @xmath0 at the comoving scale @xmath14 mpc ( @xmath15 is the normalized hubble constant @xmath16kmsec@xmath17mpc@xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "although the observational error bars of @xmath18 are not yet small , the data are consistent with the prediction of the @xmath9cdm model @xcite .",
    "recently the rsd data were used to place constraints on modified gravity models such as @xmath10 gravity and ( extended ) galileons @xcite .",
    "since the growth rate of matter perturbations in these models is different from that in the @xmath9cdm @xcite , the allowed parameter space is quite tightly constrained even from current observations .    for the models based on general relativity ( gr ) without a direct coupling between dark energy and non - relativistic matter ,",
    "the gravitational coupling appearing in the matter perturbation equation is equivalent to the newton s gravitational constant , as long as the dark energy perturbation is negligible relative to the matter perturbation .",
    "nonetheless the evolution of perturbations depends on the background cosmology , so that the dynamical dark energy models with @xmath8 different from @xmath19 can be distinguished from the @xmath9cdm .",
    "in particular , the future rsd observations may reach the level of discriminating between different dark energy models constructed in the framework of gr .",
    "in this paper we derive an analytic formula of @xmath1 valid for dynamical dark energy models including imperfect fluids , quintessence , and k - essence .",
    "provided that the sound speed @xmath20 is not much smaller than @xmath21 and that the variation of @xmath8 is not significant , our formula can reproduce the full numerical solutions with high accuracy .",
    "the derivation of @xmath1 is based on the expansion of @xmath8 in terms of the dark energy density parameter @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 . since @xmath1 is expressed in terms of the present values of @xmath5 and @xmath22 as well as @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , our formula is convenient to test for dynamical dark energy models with the observational data of the cosmic growth rate . for the models with constant @xmath8",
    "there are 3 parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in the analytic expression of @xmath1 . in tracking quintessence models @xcite , where the dark energy equation of state is nearly constant during the matter era ( @xmath29 ) ,",
