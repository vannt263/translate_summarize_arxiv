    "zakharov and shabat @xcite introduced a method called dressing which provides a construction of new solutions from old ones in the theory of integrable equations . in particular , dressing by specific very simple maps corresponds to the classical transformations already discovered by 19th century geometers like darboux , bcklund and bianchi . in the modern theory of integrable systems",
    "these simple maps are called simple factors @xcite .",
    "consider a smooth closed curve in @xmath0 .",
    "it neccessarily has periodic curvature and torsion functions , but conversely periodicity of curvature and torsion is not suffiecient to yield a closed curve .",
    "one method to obtain a wealth of examples of closed curves is to deform a given closed curve , and keeping it closed during the deformation , as the isoperiodic deformation by grinevich and schmidt @xcite .",
    "calini and ivey @xcite use this deformation to deform multiply wrapped circles and study the resulting knot type . while the isoperiodic deformation is a continuous deformation , dressing by simple factors is not , and constructs closed curves that are not slight pertubations of the original curve .",
    "calini and ivey @xcite present a bcklund transformation for curves which is very different to our approach via loop groups .    starting with a multiply wrapped circle",
    "we investigate what happens when it is dressed by suitably chosen simple factors that preserve periodicity .",
    "it turns out that for a circle with wrapping number @xmath1 there are precisly @xmath2 simple factors which do this . in analogy to the solitons we call the resulting closed curves circletons .",
    "we classify the single - circletons : curves obtained by dressing mutiply wrapped circles by one simple factor .",
    "this then immediately also leads to the classification of multi - circletons : curves obtained by dressing mutiply wrapped circles by products of simple factors .",
    "let @xmath3 be a smooth map , and set @xmath4 here @xmath5 is an additional parameter .",
    "let @xmath6 denote differentiation with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the unique solution to the inital value problem @xmath8 gives for each @xmath9 a map @xmath10 .",
    "it is entire in @xmath9 and smooth in @xmath11 . since @xmath12 for all @xmath13",
    ", it follows that @xmath14 for all @xmath13 .",

    "let @xmath36 and define @xmath37 next , define the following @xmath38-loop groups of @xmath39 by @xmath40 for @xmath41 there is a factorization @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 $ ] for some @xmath45 . to obtain uniqueness of the factors in the birkhoff factorization we impose the additional condition that @xmath46 .",
    "* birkhoff factorization * @xcite for every @xmath47 there exists a unique factorization @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and @xmath44 $ ] for some @xmath45 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "when @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 , then @xmath52 is said to lie in the _ big cell _ of @xmath53 .",
    "since the domains of the above @xmath38-loop groups are invariant under complex conjugation it makes sense to consider @xmath54 .",
    "define @xmath55 the _ reality condition _",
    "@xmath56 for all real @xmath9 in the domain of @xmath52 is then conveniently written as @xmath57 we need notation for the subgroups whose elements satisfy this reality condition , and denote @xmath58    let @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath52 lies in the big cell , and has a unique factorization @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "suppose @xmath52 does not lie in the big cell , and @xmath63 $ ] with @xmath64 . then @xmath65 .",
    "rearranging this gives @xmath66 set @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "clearly @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since the diagonal entries of @xmath71 are positive and real for @xmath72 , we conclude that also @xmath73 has non - zero diagonal entries . if @xmath74 , then the entries of the first column of @xmath75 are holomorphic functions at @xmath76 , while the first row of @xmath77 are holomorphic at @xmath78 . in particular for the first diagonal entries we get the relation @xmath79",
    "this implies that @xmath80 , giving the contradiction .",
    "the case @xmath81 is proven similarly by considering the second diagonal entries .",
    "thus @xmath52 lies in the big cell and has a unique birkhoff factorization @xmath82 . by the reality condition we also have the birkhoff factorization @xmath83 ,",
    "so by uniqueness of the birkhoff factorization we conclude @xmath84 .",

    "further , the curve @xmath109 defined by @xmath110 is an arc - length parameterized curve with complex curvature @xmath111 .    as a consequence of the last proposition",
    "the pair @xmath112 uniquely determines a curve .",
    "the converse can be shown as in @xcite , although the uniqueness fails without further normalizations .",
    "a curve is said to be of _ finite type _",

    "we call these _ finite type potentials _ , and denote them by @xmath113 with @xmath114 an element of @xmath115 for some @xmath116 .      for a finite type potential",
    "the solution of @xmath117 is @xmath118 .",

    "then @xmath126 is a finite laurent series with real coefficients of the form @xmath127 consider @xmath125 whose @xmath128 roots of @xmath129 are pairwise distinct , and define @xmath130 thus @xmath131 consists of all solutions of @xmath132 by construction this gives a degree 2 map @xmath133 , which is branched at the @xmath128 distinct roots of @xmath126 . compactifying the affine curve defined by by adding in two points @xmath134 over the point @xmath78",
    "gives a hyperelliptic riemann surface @xmath135 of genus @xmath52 , called the spectral curve .",

    "an arc - length parameterized curve @xmath23 in @xmath0 is called a _ finite type curve _ if it comes from a finite type potential in the sense of proposition [ th : curve - dpw ] .",
    "furthermore we then call @xmath135 the spectral curve of @xmath23 . the number @xmath138 is called the _",
    "spectral genus_.    let us briefly consider the case @xmath139 , since all computations are elementary .",
    "then @xmath140 consists of elements of the form @xmath141 then @xmath142 for any @xmath143 , and the arc - length parmetrized curve is @xmath144 which is a circle unless @xmath145 , in which case it is a line .",
    "thus spectral genus @xmath139 curves are circles .",
