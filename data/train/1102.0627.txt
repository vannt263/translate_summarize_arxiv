    "a model of coupled limit cycle oscillators explains a variety of natural phenomena in various fields of science .",
    "the applications range from the description of the collective dynamics of josephson junctions @xcite , lasers @xcite , and electrochemical oscillators @xcite to neuronal populations @xcite , etc . very often , when the oscillator network is not too sparse , it can be approximately considered as fully connected , or globally coupled .",
    "ensembles of weakly interacting units are successfully treated within the framework of phase approximation @xcite .",
    "most popular is the kuramoto model of sine - coupled phase oscillators , or its extension , the kuramoto - sakaguchi model @xcite .",
    "this model explains self - synchronization and appearance of a collective mode ( mean field ) in an ensemble of generally non - identical elements ; the transition to synchrony occurs at a certain critical value of the coupling constant that is roughly proportional to the width of the distribution of natural frequencies @xcite .",
    "an extension of the kuramoto model for the case of nonlinear coupling has been suggested in our recent publications @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "nonlinearity in this context means that the effect of the collective mode on an individual unit depends on the amplitude of this mode , so that , e.g. , the interaction of the field and of a unit can be attractive for a weak field and repulsive for a strong one .",
    "formally , this is represented by the dependence of the parameters of the kuramoto - sakaguchi model ( the coupling strength and the phase shift ) on the mean field amplitude .",
    "the model exhibits nontrivial effects like a destruction of a completely synchronous state and appearance of partial synchrony in an ensemble of identical units .",
    "moreover , in this setup the frequencies of the collective mode and of oscillators can be different and incommensurate .",
    "an analytical description of the dynamics of oscillator ensembles remains an important and challenging problem .",
    "a seminal work in this direction is that of watanabe and strogatz ( ws ) @xcite . the ws theory is a powerful tool that provides a nearly full dynamical description of ensembles of _ identical _ oscillators , sine - coupled to a common external force . in particular",
    ", this force can be the mean field of the population , so that for the case of identical units the ws theory almost completely describes the kuramoto - sakaguchi and the nonlinear models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this description is given in terms of three collective ( macroscopic ) variables , hereafter called the ws variables , plus constants of motion .",
    "the collective variables obey @xmath0 ws equations ( see  @xcite ) ; thus , the dynamics of an ensemble of identical elements is effectively @xmath0-dimensional .",
    "however , the ws theory has one drawback : it can not describe certain cluster states , i.e. regimes where the oscillators build identical groups . in this paper",
    "we complement the ws theory by performing a direct bifurcation analysis of the dynamical phase equations of the model of nonlinearly coupled phase oscillators .",
    "we will especially emphasis on cluster states and their bifurcations , in particular on the heteroclinic cycles ( see @xcite for a recent review of robust heteroclinic cycles ) that can be hardly treated within the ws approach .",
    "we will see that the role of clusters is mostly important for small ensembles . because of identity of the oscillators , the system possesses a permutation symmetry , so we employ the corresponding bifurcation approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the basic model in section  [ sec : mncpo ] . then in section  [ sec : gasb ] we discuss general properties of bifurcations , possible attractors and their interpretation as different synchronization patterns . in section  [ sec : ncowqpn ] we present bifurcation diagrams for a model of nonlinearly coupled oscillators with quadratic nonlinearity  @xcite . in conclusion a relation to the ws theory is discussed .",

    "they are assumed to interact globally , via the complex mean field @xmath4 having amplitude @xmath5 and phase @xmath6 : @xmath7 here @xmath8 are natural frequencies of the oscillators and @xmath9 is the coupling function .",
    "different popular models correspond to different choices of coupling function @xmath9 .",
    "the case @xmath10 corresponds to the famous kuramoto model  @xcite , while the choice @xmath11 yields the kuramoto - sakaguchi model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a coupling function that nonlinearly depends on the amplitude of the mean field @xmath5 and on a set of parameters @xmath12 : @xmath13 this model has been introduced in  @xcite and studied in the thermodynamic limit @xmath14 in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the properties of small ensembles of nonlinearly coupled oscillators , restricting our analysis to the case of identical oscillators @xmath15 and of phase nonlinearity only @xmath16 .",
    "the latter restriction is not very important , as the cases where @xmath17 can change sign are in fact trivial . substituting ( [ eq : nop ] ) in ( [ eq : gcpl ] ) we obtain an equivalent formulation of the ensemble dynamics @xmath18    to exploit the phase - shift symmetry of this system one can describe the system dynamics in terms of the phase differences @xmath19 thus reducing this @xmath1-dimensional system to the @xmath20-dimensional system @xmath21\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can check that order parameter @xmath5 can be written in phase differences as @xmath22 below we will discuss synchronization transitions in the system studying invariant manifolds , fixed points , cycles , heteroclinic cycles and their bifurcations for the system in phase differences ( [ phasedifferences ] ) .    before proceeding to the analysis , we mention that system ( [ eq : gcpl1 ] ) possesses symmetries given by all permutations of the oscillators @xcite . due to identity of the oscillators ,",
