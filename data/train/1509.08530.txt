    "the two - axis countertwisting spin - squeezing hamiltonian @xmath2 @xmath3 was originally proposed by kitagawa and ueda @xcite . in eq .",

    "the quantity @xmath7 may refer to a real angular momentum or a pseudospin @xmath8 representing the collective squeezing of @xmath9 spin half systems @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath10 yields maximal squeezing , with a squeezing angle independent of system size or evolution time .",
    "experimental implementation has not yet been achieved , while a number of theoretical proposals have been put forward @xcite .    a general analytic solution to the hamiltonian for arbitrary angular momentum does not seem to be available @xcite .",
    "solutions to the dynamics for low values of spin are of interest to experiments with trapped ions @xcite and quantum magnets @xcite , for example . in ref .",
    "@xcite a bound of spin @xmath11 was stated as the maximum angular momentum value for which analytic solutions can be found .",
    "we presume this was based on the fact that the hamiltonian matrix in that case is of dimension @xmath12 leading to a characteristic polynomial of quartic order , which is the highest degree for which algebraic solutions can generally be found @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the existence of analytical solutions ( with the additional presence of an external field ) up to spin @xmath13 was reported and explicit expressions were provided for spin @xmath14 . no explanation was given of the unexpected fact that solutions for spins much larger than @xmath11 were found , nor was the maximum value of spin for which analytical solutions could be found supplied .    in the present article",
    "we systematically analyze the question of analytical solvability of the two - axis countertwisting spin squeezing hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hta ] ) .",
    "we extend the bound for solvability to spin @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 spin half particles ( we note that in ref .  @xcite spin @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath13 spin half particles ) .",
    "we point out that critical roles in the solvability of the model for large spin values are played by the chiral symmetry and sparsity of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "our approach requires only the use of matrix representations of the angular momentum operators and the evaluation the time evolution operator @xcite .",
    "our results may be useful for experiments with small number of spins .",
    "in this section we go over some properties of the hamiltonian @xmath10 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hta ] ) which are relevant to the discussion of analytical solvability .",
    "first , it can be seen readily by using @xmath15 that @xmath10 is hermitian , implying that its eigenvalues are real .",
    "further , by using @xmath16 we can rewrite @xmath17 now let us consider a rotation by the angle @xmath18 about the @xmath19 axis .",
    "this rotation leaves @xmath19 unaffected , but reverses the sign of @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 which can be written as the anticommutation relation @xmath22 this relation implies that @xmath23 is a chiral symmetry of @xmath10 @xcite . in practical terms",
    ", the implication of the anticommutation is that eigenvalues of @xmath10 occur as signed pairs @xmath24 ( a brief proof is provided in the appendix for the reader s convenience ) .",
    "therefore if @xmath10 can be represented by an even dimensional matrix , then the characteristic polynomial of @xmath10 @xmath25 is even in @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the unit matrix of the same dimension as @xmath10 . if instead @xmath10 is of odd dimension , then its characteristic polynomial is @xmath26 times a polynomial even in @xmath26 . in this case",
    "there is necessarily a zero eigenvalue , and all other eigenvalues are signed pairs .",
    "specific examples will be given below .",
    "as will be verified with these examples , the property of chiral symmetry contributes to giving a simple form to the characteristic polynomials for even large spins , and making them analytically solvable . for completeness",
    "we note that the hamiltonian considered by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents an external field along the @xmath30 axis , also possesses the chiral symmetry indicated above .",
    "this partly explains the solvability of the squeezing model @xmath31 analytically for up to spin @xmath13 .",
    "finally , by using the matrix elements in the basis @xmath32 where @xmath33 is diagonal @xmath34 it can be readily verified that @xmath10 is a rather sparse matrix , i.e. most of its elements are zero .",
    "this feature also contributes to simplifying the form of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "we now consider the time evolution operator @xmath35 since @xmath36 determines the spin dynamics completely , the model is analytically solvable if a matrix representation for @xmath36 can be found , with all entries determined analytically . a straightforward way to implement this is to diagonalize @xmath10 .",
    "if the eigenvalues of @xmath10 can be found analytically , the diagonal and analytic form of @xmath36 follows .",
    "however , the calculation of expectation values then requires the relevant initial state to be rotated by the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath37 as these matrices can be quite cumbersome and require the determination and careful handling of the eigenvectors of @xmath38 we follow instead an equivalent procedure that only deals with the eigenvalues of @xmath38 but avoids referring to its eigenvectors .",
    "our approach is to expand the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uta ] ) in a taylor series .",
    "the termination of that series is actually guaranteed since @xmath10 is a finite dimensional matrix .",
    "this guarantee comes from the cayley - hamilton theorem , which states that every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation , which in turn implies that any power of the @xmath10 can be expressed in terms of the matrix powers @xmath39 where @xmath7 is the associated spin .",
    "the entries of the terminating matrix representation of @xmath36 , it turns out , can be written as functions of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 @xcite , see below . therefore , if the eigenvalues can be calculated analytically",
    ", then the spin dynamics can be found exactly .",
    "for reference , we quote the explicit expression for @xmath36 in the case where @xmath10 possesses nondegenerate eigenvalues @xmath40 ( the degenerate case can be handled via some straightforward modifications ) @xcite ) @xmath41",
    "in table 1 . we show for various spins the characteristic polynomial @xmath42 of @xmath43 . we make some comments on the entries in this table . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the eigenvalues are both zero , and it can be verified that @xmath45 consistent with the observation , first made by kitagawa and ueda , that a single spin half particle can not be squeezed @xcite .    generally for half - integer spin , @xmath42 is even in @xmath26 and some of the eigenvalues are degenerate . in table 1 , we have indicated which spin values lead to degeneracy in the eigenvalues of @xmath10 , so that the appropriate procedure may be used for obtaining @xmath36 . generally ,",
    "if any factor in the characteristic polynomial repeats , then there is degeneracy in the energy spectrum . to make this identification rigorous ,",
    "we have calculated the discriminant of @xmath42 , which returns a zero value if degeneracy is present .",
    "the combination of chiral symmetry and matrix sparseness leads to rather compact expressions for the spin half - integer @xmath42 s .",
    "indeed it is remarkable that @xmath42 for @xmath46 fits on a single line .",
    "for integer spin , @xmath42 is a polynomial even in @xmath26 , times a single factor of @xmath26 .",
    "there seems to be no degeneracy in general and the polynomials are less compact in form than in the half - integer spin case .",
    "upto @xmath47 it is evident that the roots of the polynomials can be found analytically , since the factors are of degree @xmath48 or less , and solvability by radicals is guaranteed by the abel - ruffini theorem @xcite .",
    "while spins @xmath49 to @xmath50 have factors sextic in @xmath26 , since these polynomials are even in @xmath26 , they can be thought of as being cubics in @xmath51 which can be solved analytically .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the octic factors in the polynomials for spins @xmath52 to @xmath53 finally , spin @xmath54 to @xmath0 contain factors of degree @xmath13 , which can be considered as being polynomials of degree @xmath49 in @xmath55 while the roots of such factors can not be found algebraically , they can be stated in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite . however , for @xmath56 , there is a factor of degree @xmath57 in @xmath26 ( i.e. of degree @xmath58 in @xmath59 ) .",
    "while the roots of polynomials of degree @xmath58 and higher can be found in terms of modular functions ( for example ) , they involve transcendental functions , and we will consider them not to be of closed form and therefore analytically unsolvable @xcite .",
    "we note that for @xmath60 the polynomial roots can be found numerically and inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : utazela ] ) , thus yielding a semianalytic solution for any spin value .      to compactly illustrate our results",
    ", we present the details for @xmath61 ( @xmath48 spin half particles ) , a case for which there seem to be no explicit results in the literature . in this instance , the matrix representations are given by @xmath62 @xmath63 , and @xmath64 the eigenvalues of @xmath10 can be read off from table 1 . as @xmath65 .",
