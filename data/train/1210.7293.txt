    "gravitational - wave interferometers like laser interferometric gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) in the united states of america @xcite , virgo @xcite in europe , and their smaller counterparts geo600 in germany @xcite and tama in japan @xcite , are using super - precise opto - mechanical measurements to search for astrophysical gravitational waves .",
    "after several years of taking scientific data , ligo and virgo are currently being upgraded with improved instrumentation and should again become operational in 2015 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ligo science collaboration ( lsc ) and the virgo community are projecting @xcite that with the upgraded technology , both interferometers will soon be measuring multiple coalescences of relativistic compact objects ( neutron stars and black holes ) .",
    "these projections are based in part on the theoretical predictions for spectral density of the interferometers noise .",
    "it is thought that the random processes that contribute most of the noise , i.e. the seismic shaking of the suspensions @xcite , the thermo - mechanical and thermo - refractive fluctuations of the mirror surface @xcite , and the quantum - mechanical fluctuations of the light - field coupled to the test - mass motion @xcite , @xcite are well understood @xcite .",
    "one of the dangerous unknowns for the advanced gravitational - wave interferometers is a non - gaussian noise from a superposition of transient events in the instrument . in this paper",
    "i concentrate on the creep noise , which is caused by a superposition of the sudden localized tension stress releases ( creep events ) in suspension fibers and their end attachments .",
    "it has been thought that a creep event would couple to the interferometer s readout via lengthening of the fiber @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was argued that because of the earth curvature , the laser beam was not strictly perpendicular to the suspension fiber , and thus the fiber s lengthening would result in some test - mass displacement along the beam . in this paper",
    "i show that this coupling , while present , is not dominant , at least for a simple model where the fiber is represented by a cylinder with constant radius . instead , a creep event couples to the interferometer s output predominantly through excitation of the pendulum and violin modes of the suspension ; this coupling is explicitly calculated in this work .",
    "the fact that creep events couple to the transverse vibrational modes of the system is in agreement with the experiment of @xcite who find a substantial excess noise in the transverse motion of a tungsten wire stretched to 20% of the break - up stress .",
    "similar excess noise in steel wires was observed by @xcite .",
    "however , the results in @xcite were not confirmed by @xcite who did not observe any excess noise in the motion of the stressed tungsten wire . moreover ,",
    "it is far from obvious that the processes responsible for the creep events in metallic fibers @xcite will be operating in the fused silica suspension fibers such as the ones that are currently used in geo600 and that will be used in the advanced ligo , virgo , and kagra suspensions @xcite .",
    "two experiments with fused silica fibers have been performed by @xcite and @xcite ; in both experiments no excess noise was discovered near violin resonant frequency of the fiber . in a more recent work @xcite ,",
    "the motion of a test mass was monitored in geo600 , where the fused silica suspension fibers were used .",
    "the motion near the violin - mode frequency was entirely consistent with that of the thermally excited violin mode .",
    "therefore , currently there is no experimental evidence that the creep excess noise in the future advanced gravitational - wave interferometers will pose a serious problem .",
    "however , there are at least two reasons to keep investigating the creep noise : ( 1 ) the measurements in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have all been performed at frequencies from several hundreds to thousands of hz , where the noise of ground - based interferometers is strongly dominated by the quantum shot noise , while the danger from creep noise exists at much lower frequencies , in the same region of tens of hz where the shot noise is unimportant , and ( 2 ) the main source of creep noise may well be not inside the fused silica suspension fibers , but inside other carrying parts of the system like the bond between the test masses and the  ears \" that are supporting them ( riccardo desalvo and norna robertson , private communications ) .",
    "it is thus important to understand how a creep event inside the suspension couples to the horizontal motion of the test - mass , as well as the frequency dependence of the noise generated by a multitude of the creep events .",
    "this paper lays a theoretical foundation for addressing these issues .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "i present a convenient reciprocity relationship for linear elasto - dynamic systems . in section 3",
    ", i use this relationship to derive the interferometer s response to a creep event , as a function of location of the stress release in the fiber . in section 4 ,",
    "i derive the functional form of the creep noise spectral density , in the limit where the creep noise can be treated as a stationary gaussian random process .",
    "a brief discussion of the future work is presented in section 5 .",
    "during the creep event , the stress changes suddenly in some small volume of the fiber . but how does this affect the motion of the test mass ? at first glance , this seems like a formidable problem in elastodynamics .",
    "however , it turns out that solving the reciprocal problem is sufficient .",
    "namely , one should in a mental experiment apply a sudden force to the test mass and compute the motion of the fiber at the location where the creep event originated .",
    "the solution of the reciprocal problem leads directly to the solution of the original problem .",
    "reciprocity relations have been thoroughly studied in elastodynamics ; see e.g.  @xcite for a comprehensive review . here",
    "i will use the following formulation of the reciprocity theorem :    consider an elastodynamic system initially at rest , that is being driven by a distributed force , with the force - per - volume given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some function that is non - zero only for @xmath2 . consider also a readout variable @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the displacement from rest at location @xmath5 and time @xmath6 .",
    "both the applied forces and displacement are assumed to be small , so that a linear approximation of elastodynamics holds .",
    "the reciprocity theorem states that if in the pair of equations  ( [ force1 ] ) and ( [ displacement ] ) the form - factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 are interchanged then the readout variable @xmath9 remains the same .",
    "in other words , the input - output dynamical system is invariant with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 interchange , with @xmath1 being the input and @xmath12 being the output .",
    "the proof of the theorem is as follows .",
    "let @xmath13 be the normal modes of the system , with proper angular frequencies @xmath14 .",
    "a displacement field @xmath15 can then be decomposed into a series @xmath16 the mode amplitudes @xmath17 are the new dynamical coordinates .",
    "the lagrangian of the unforced system is given by @xmath18 , \\label{lfree}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the effective mass of the @xmath20th mode .",
    "external forcing of eq .",
    "( [ force1 ] ) is introduced via an additional interaction langangian term @xmath21 which , in terms of the coordinates @xmath22 can be rewritten as @xmath23 here @xmath24 are constants given by @xmath25 the full langrangian allows us to immediately obtain the equations of motion : @xmath26 therefore , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the solution to the forced harmonic oscillator problem @xmath29 with the initial condition @xmath30 .",
    "the readout variable in eq .",
    "( [ displacement ] ) can then be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined similarly to @xmath24 : @xmath33 the readout variable @xmath12 is invariant with respect to the interchange of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "q.  e.  d.",
    "a creep event happens when a minute section of the suspension fiber refuses to support its full share of the tension stress .",
    "what exactly happens microscopically is poorly known , but a simple model will suffice for modelling of the elastodynamical behavior .",
    "let us assume that a small fiber element of volume @xmath34 suddenly does not support any elastic stress @xmath35 .",
    "i now consider a slightly - reduced elastic system , namely the original one with the small volume element @xmath34 taken out .",
    "this slightly - reduced system experiences a sudden force applied to the boundary of the volume element @xmath34 , so that the boundary surface element @xmath36 , assumed to be directed outside of the volume , experiences the force @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the unit vectors along the coordinate axes , and the summation over the dummy indices is assumed .",
    "i would like to evaluate the test - mass displacement @xmath12 under the action of the force in eq .",
    "( [ compensator ] ) that is switched on at @xmath39 ( this situations is somewhat similar physically to the excitation of magnetar motion as a result of sudden reconfiguration of the magnetosphere during a giant magnetar flare ; see @xcite ) . by the reciprocity theorem from the previous section ,",
    "this is equivalent to acting with the suddenly switched on force on the test mass , directed along the laser beam : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the heavyside function @xcite .",
    "one then has to find the response of the slightly - reduced elastic subsystem to this force , and in particular that of the reciprocal readout variable @xmath42 that is dictated by the functional form of the force in eq .",
    "( [ compensator ] ) @xmath43 where the integration domain is the boundary of the volume @xmath34 .",
    "it is obvious that for sufficiently small @xcite volume @xmath34 the response of the slightly - reduced system is the same as that of the full system , and from hereon i shall make no distinction between the two .    by gauss theorem , for small @xmath34",
    "the above equation can be written as @xmath44 where the strain @xmath45 is evaluated at the location of the creep event . to sum up : by finding the response of @xmath46 from eq .",
    "( [ xreadout ] ) to the force @xmath47 applied at the test mass along the direction of the laser beam , one finds the test - mass displacement in response to the creep event .",

    "lets take stock , and sum up what has been done so far . in a reciprocal problem , one has to find out the induced shear at the location of the creep - event source when a sudden force @xmath74 is applied to the test mass . in this subsection",
    "i have done part of the problem , i.e.  i found the test - mass displacement under the action of the said force . to make further progress , i need to choose a particular model for the suspension fiber itself . in the next subsection",
    "i consider one of the particular cases that can be dealt with analytically .",
    "the treatment of complicated geometries is left for future work .",
    "let us consider in detail the case where the creep events occur inside a cyllindrical fiber of constant crossection that is rigidly attached at the top to a suspension isolation plate and at the bottom to the test mass .",
    "it is assumed here that the allowed test - mass motion is a parallel translation but not rotation , as is the case when four suspension fibers are used .",

    "the coupling is dominated by the @xmath133 part of the solution and @xmath134 .    in this subsection s model the creep events",
    "are assumed to be triggered homogeneously in the suspension fibers @xcite .",
    "thus the creep events have only @xmath135 chance to be triggered within @xmath90 from the attachment points .",
    "however , they have individually much larger impact [ by a factor of @xmath136 on the test - mass motion then those ones originating away from the attachments .",
    "it follows that the creep events originating within the bending regions near attachment points contribute most of the creep noise ; their contribution is greater by a factor of @xmath137 than that of the creep events away from the attachment points .",
    "this is studied in section 4 .",
    "let us now consider the case where a laser beam is inclined by a small angle @xmath138 with respect to the horizontal direction .",
    "this is an inevitable effect because of the spherical shape of the equipotential surface on which the test masses in the same arm are located ; for @xmath139 km arm @xmath140 radians .",
    "it is this misalignment that was previously thought to be the major source of the creep noise @xcite ; we treat this mechanism within the formalism developed in the previous section . the reciprocal force applied at the test mass",

    "here we take into account only one vertical suspension mode with the angular frequency @xmath143 and the damping rate @xmath144 ; the higher - order vertical modes are at much higher frequency and have a much weaker coupling to the sudden force .",

    "( [ xreadout ] ) .",
    "their ratio is approximately given by @xmath147 it is the smallness of this ratio that makes the contribution to the creep noise from the creep - induced fiber - lengthening be subdominant relative to the direct horizontal coupling , in most of the ligo band .",
    "consider now a situation where multiple creep events are triggered in sequence , .",
    "according to the central limit theorem , if the events occur sufficiently frequently , their superposition produces a random gaussian noise in the test - mass motion .",
    "the response of the test - mass to a single creep event can be written as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the time when the creep event is triggered , and @xmath150 is the set of parameters characterizing the event ( location in the fiber , effective volume , etc . ) . in what follows",
    "we assume that the creep events are statistically independent from each other and that the creep - event parameters sample some well - defined probability - distribution function .",
    "this assumption is known not to hold in some systems that exhibit so - called  crackle noise \" @xcite , and will be relaxed in future work . if the probability density distribution @xmath151 is time - invariant , then the creep noise is stationary and has a spectral density given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the rate of the creep events .",
    "the @xmath154 implies a multi - dimensional integral over the parameter space of @xmath150 . evaluating this expression for the model of the cylindrical fiber , we get @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157+k\\lambda[2\\sin(2kl)+kl]\\right\\}. \\label{g}\\ ] ] here @xmath158 is the ensemble average of the @xmath159 of the creep events in the system . naturally , this quantity is meaningful only in our simple model for the creep events , however a term like this , representing the mean of the squared intensity of the creep events , is expected in any generic model for the localised creep events .",
    "the first term in square brakets on the right - hand side of the above equations is due to creep events generated near the attachment points , while the second term is that due to creep events generated in the fiber s bulk ; in both of these the terms of order @xmath160 have been neglected .",
    "it is clear that the noise is strongly dominated by the creep events near the attachment point .",
    "the spectral sensity of noise due to the vertical lengthening of the fibers is given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 the plots for @xmath163 and @xmath164 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . while the scale on the vertical axis of these plots is arbitrary",
    ", since @xmath165 is unknown , the spectral density shape and the relative contribution of the two noises are fixed .",
    "we observe that the direct horizontal coupling induces greater creep noise than the vertical motion , at all frequencies except at a narrow band around @xmath166 .",
    "in this paper i have provided an elastodynamic calculation of the interferometer s response to a creep event , and found the functional form of the creep noise in the stationary limit .",
    "a simple model where the fiber was modeled as a cylinder of constant radius was considered in detail , since this allowed me to obtain analytical expressions for the test - mass response .",
    "two interrelated qualitative features of this model are worth noting : ( 1 ) creep events near the fiber s ends receive a much stronger test - mass response in the ligo band than those at the center of the fiber , and contribute the majority of the creep noise , and ( 2 ) the dominant coupling to the inteferometer s readout is via excitation of the violin and pendulum modes of the suspension , and not via the lenthening of the fiber .",
    "i should caution though that these conclusions may not hold in a fiber with a more complex dependence of the cross - sectional radius @xmath76 on the height @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , the fibers in advanced ligo suspensions are made significantly thicker near the end points , in order to minimize the suspension thermal noise .",
    "this thickening will reduce the local tension stress , thus reducing both the coupling of a creep event to the test mass motion and the likelyhood of a creep event to occur .    in a simple model for the creep noise",
    ", i have assumed that the creep events are triggered homogeneously in the suspention fiber .",
    "this may not be the case .",
    "the creep events may be triggered preferentially ( 1 ) at the locations where the fiber is welded to the test mass or the upper suspension plate , although this is not very likely since at the weld the fiber is much thicker than in its center ( @xmath167 m ) , so the tension is small ( norna robertson , private communications ) , or ( 2 ) near the locations where the ears that support the test mass are bonded to it . the bonding material is non - metallic and non - glassy and is a potential source of problems ( riccardo desalvo , private communications ) . in future work",
    "i plan to explore the spatial distribution of the expected creep events , as well as relax the assumption of their statistical independence .",
    "i plan to also deal with the issues of non - gaussianity of the creep - event triggers ; it can presumably can be mitigated by considering the output of several independent interferometers .",
    "some comfort for the advanced interferometers can be derived from the fact that experiments @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have not observed any influence of the creep noise on the violin - mode motion .",
    "we note , however , that all of the measurements in question have searched for the creep noise at high frequencies corresponding to the resonant frequencies of violin modes , from several hundred to several thousand hz .",
    "if the creep events are statistically independent from each other , then the expected creep noise is red , with @xmath168 except near resonances ; see eqs .",
    "( [ sdensity ] ) and ( [ q ] ) .",
    "this is the same scaling as that for the suspension thermal noise in the case where damping of the fiber s motion is structural ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one may argue that since no creep noise that exceeds the suspension thermal noise is observed at high frequencies , none is expected to exceed the suspension thermal noise at low frequencies as well .",
    "this argument , however , relies on a very simple model for the creep noise that was developed in section 4 , and in particular it relies on the creep events being statistically independent",
    ". this assumption does not hold in many systems that release their free energy via spontaneous acoustic emission events ( known as the  crackle noise \" ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus further experimental and theoretical work is warranted for the low - freqyency domain .",

    "<S> in gravitational - wave interferometers , test masses are suspended on thin fibers which experience considerable tension stress . </S>",
    "<S> sudden microscopic stress release in a suspension fiber , which i call a creep event , would excite motion of the test mass that would be coupled to the interferometer s readout . the random test - mass motion due to a time - sequence of creep events is referred to as creep noise. in this paper i present an elasto - dynamic calculation for the test - mass motion due to a creep event . </S>",
    "<S> i show that within a simple suspension model , the main coupling to the optical readout occurs via a combination of a  dc \" horizontal displacement of the test mass , and excitation of the violin and pendulum modes , and not , as was thought previously , via lengthening of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> when the creep events occur sufficiently frequently and their statistics is time - independent , the creep noise can be well - approximated by a stationary gaussian random process . </S>",
    "<S> i derive the functional form of the creep noise spectral density in this limit , with the restrictive assumption that the creep events are statistically independent from each other . </S>"
