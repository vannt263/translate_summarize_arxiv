    "in other words the difference between @xmath21 and an @xmath137-sorted semi - theory is that for some @xmath12-tuples @xmath196 in @xmath137 there may be no object of @xmath21 indexed by @xmath196 , and thus the cone corresponding to @xmath196 will be also missing . to fix it",

    "we give @xmath669 a finite product sketch structure by defining the set of cones @xmath682 that consists of all cones in @xmath31 and for each @xmath683 a cone @xmath148 with @xmath684 , for @xmath17 @xmath685 and with projections given by the morphisms @xmath686 .",
    "clearly @xmath668 is an @xmath137-sorted semi - theory .",
    "it remains to show that the homotopy category of homotopy algebras over @xmath30 is equivalent to the homotopy category of homotopy algebras over @xmath668 .",
    "let @xmath687 be the inclusion functor , and let @xmath688 be the functor induced by @xmath221 .",
    "the functor @xmath221 has a right adjoint @xmath154 which can be described as follows . for @xmath689",
    "the functor @xmath690 coincides with @xmath130 when restricted to @xmath691 . for an object @xmath692",

    "since the homotopy categories of homotopy algebras are obtained from @xmath702 and @xmath703 by inverting all objectwise weak equivalences we obtain that @xmath652 and @xmath154 give inverse equivalences on the level of the homotopy categories .",
    "we can now use lemma [ bb ] and lemma [ bbb ] to see that any finite product sketch @xmath21 can be replaced by a multi - sorted semi - theory @xmath704 which has an equivalent homotopy category of homotopy algebras and use this to prove theorem [ maini cor ] .",

    "notice that for a functor of finite product sketches which is an injection on objects : @xmath717 we can induce a cone preserving functor : @xmath718 @xmath719 where @xmath720 makes sense because @xmath221 preserves cones .",
    "this induces a functor : @xmath721 which is defined naturally on objects of the form @xmath722 and which sends any added cones in @xmath723 to the obvious cone in @xmath724 we see that this is a functor of multi - sorted theories . by construction",
    "we see that @xmath725 induces an equivalence of the homotopy categories of homotopy algebras if and only if @xmath221 does the same .",
    "the remainder of the proof is therefore a consequence of theorem [ mainiv ] since theorem [ mainiv ] is essentially theorem [ mainii ] for multi - sorted semi theories .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that the assumptions on objects and cones in theorem [ mainiv ] lift to the associated assumptions on objects and cones for theorem [ mainii ] .    in summary , given a finite product sketch @xmath726 we can consider the homotopy structures that arise from homotopy algebras over @xmath727 in many situations these homotopy structures can be interesting to study ( for example the infinite loop space structures that arise from considering homotopy algebras over @xmath728 [ gamma example ] ) and it is worth determining if there is some weakly equivalent strict algebraic structure that also arises .",
    "this paper has shown that such an equivalence exists if we consider strict algebras over the associated simplicial multi - sorted algebraic theory @xmath152 .",
