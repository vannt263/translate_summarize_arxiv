    ", the tree - level higgs boson mass has an upper bound of @xmath5 . to get to 125 gev",
    ", it requires large radiative contributions from the stop loops  @xcite .",
    "this could happen if the stops are heavy and/or the trilinear @xmath6 term of the stop sector is large  @xcite . to keep the fine - tuning minimal , it is preferable to have a large @xmath6 term so that the stops masses can be lowered to @xmath7 tev or below .",
    "a large @xmath6 term implies large off - diagonal masses of the stop mass matrix so there will be a substantial mixing between the left - handed and the right - handed stops in the mass eigenstates . as a consequence , there will also be a sizable mass difference between the two stop mass eigenstates .    as a key to the naturalness problem ,",
    "the stops have been extensively searched for at the lhc .",
    "assuming that the lightest neutralino @xmath8 is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and is stable , the search limit for the @xmath9 decay ( assuming 100% branch fraction ) has reached @xmath10 gev for @xmath11  gev at the run 1 of lhc  @xcite . from the naturalness point view , some fine - tuning is already required if the lightest stop is heavier than 750 gev .",
    "however , the search limits are significantly weakened in the compressed region , where @xmath12 . in particular",
    ", there is a gap along @xmath13 in the @xmath14 plane . in this case",
    "the top quark and the neutralino from the stop decay are roughly static in the stop rest frame . for",
    "the stop pair production , the neutralinos travel along with the stops and their momenta tend to cancel each other out , leaving little missing transverse energy ( met ) in the signal .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to be distinguished from the sm top pair production background and it is still possible to have a relatively light @xmath15 .",
    "there have been studies trying to identify useful variables to probe this compressed region but the reach is limited  @xcite . a more promising strategy is to consider the stop pair production with a hard initial state radiation ( isr ) jet , then the neutralinos are boosted in the opposite direction to the isr jet , giving rise to some met .",
    "it may have a discovery reach up to @xmath16  gev at lhc 13 tev with 300 fb@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "since naturalness needs both stops to be not too heavy , if @xmath15 happens to lie in the compressed region , it may be easier to search for @xmath18 even though it is heavier .",
    "indeed , both atlas and cms have performed searches for the heavier stop for @xmath19 so that @xmath15 escapes the detection  @xcite .",
    "these searches adopted the simplified model approach , assuming that the heavier stop decays to the lighter stop plus a @xmath20 or a higgs boson ( @xmath21 ) with a 100% branching fraction .",
    "the exclusion limits for the @xmath18 mass are up to @xmath22 gev for the @xmath23 decay mode and similar but somewhat weaker for the @xmath24 decay mode .",
    "the simplified model approach is a good strategy if there is a dominant decay channel or the search limit is dictated by a certain decay channel .",
    "one can easily recast the search result to a wide range of models which have similar decay processes and final states , by rescaling the cross sections and branching ratios .",
    "however , it is seldom a good approximation for the system of the two stops . because the left - handed stop and sbottom belong to an @xmath25 doublet , there is always a sbottom with mass within the vicinity of the two stops .",
    "the presence of the sbottom will give additional decay modes of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , there could be other charginos and neutralinos lighter than @xmath18 besides @xmath8 .",
    "if this is the case , there will also be decay chains going through them as intermediate states . as a result",
    ", the @xmath18 decays often have many decay channels without a dominant one  @xcite .",
    "different decay channels have different final states and hence require different signal selection criteria .",
    "it makes the @xmath18 search in the compressed region in a realistic scenario more complicated than simply rescaling the simplified model analysis .",
    "an alternative approach to the simplified model is the pmssm  @xcite , which parametrizes mssm with some modest assumptions .",
    "the assumptions include @xmath26 parity conservation with the lightest neutralino being the lsp , minimal flavor violation at the tev scale with no cp violation in the susy sector , and degenerate sfermion masses for the first two generations .",
    "it contains 19 phenomenological parameters and a scan over these parameters generates a large model samples for phenomenological studies .",
    "however , if one is interested in the stop system , scanning over the full 19-parameter space may be an overkill . to study the possible interesting decay patterns of the stop and sbottom system and their experimental signals",
    "one should focus on the most relevant parameters .",
    "this is the approach taken in this paper .",
    "we divide the models into two scenarios . in the first scenario all neutralinos and charginos except the lsp are heavier than @xmath18 so they decouple .",
    "the only relevant particles are @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , whose masses and interactions are only governed by a few parameters .",
    "we scan through them and find model points with different characteristic decay patterns .",
    "we identify categories of signal channels which may be sensitive to various final states of the decay chains and study the signal significance over the backgrounds .",
    "the real search reach may require division and combination of many different channels . in the second scenario we consider additional charginos and neutralinos below the mass of @xmath18 , which can introduce even more complicated decay patterns .",
    "we perform the similar study as in the first scenario for the model points where the additional charginos and neutralinos play important roles in the decay chains .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in mssm , after minimizing the higgs potential , the @xmath20 boson mass is given by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the soft susy breaking masses of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 doublets at an uv cutoff scale @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the radiative contributions to the soft susy breaking masses below the cutoff , and @xmath40 is the susy - preserving higgs mass parameter which is also the approximate higgsino mass . to avoid fine - tuning on the @xmath20 mass , there should not be a large cancellation among various terms in the above equation .",
    "in particular , the radiative correction @xmath38 receives the largest contribution from the stop loops : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are soft - breaking mass terms for the left - handed top - bottom doublet and the right - handed top squarks , @xmath6 is the trilinear soft - susy breaking of the corresponding yukawa interaction , and @xmath43 is taken to be the geometric average of the stop masses @xmath44 .",
    "the tuning of @xmath45 due to the stop mass contribution @xmath46 is already at the level of @xmath47 for @xmath48  tev and @xmath49 tev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , naturalness argument would prefer both stops to have masses below or around 1 tev .      at the tree level",
    ", mssm also predicts the light higgs boson mass to be less than the @xmath20 mass : @xmath50 this contradicts the observed higgs mass at 125 gev .",
    "the loop corrections can raise the higgs boson mass to evade the tree - level upper bound of @xmath51",
    ". however , to reach 125 gev the loop contributions must be significant .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the stop loop , which implies constraints on the masses of the stop sector .",
    "the higgs boson mass including the leading one - loop stop contribution is given by  @xcite @xmath52 , \\ ] ] where @xmath53 as defined previously and @xmath54 is the stop mass mixing parameter . from the formula one can see that without the @xmath55 term , the stop masses need to be raised to very high values in order to generate a higgs massif 125 gev .",
    "this would be in severe conflict with naturalness .",
    "to minimize the fine - tuning , the second term in the bracket should be large and the one - loop correction is maximized when @xmath56 .",
    "such a large @xmath55 implies a large mixing between the left - handed and right - handed stops , which has interesting phenomenological implications .",
    "the mass matrices for the stops , @xmath57 , and sbottoms , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the term related to @xmath63 and @xmath59 mixing from trilinear couplings , and @xmath64 @xmath65 represent the @xmath66-term contributions .",
    "notice that in the limit where there is no mixing , both @xmath67 and @xmath63 masses are controlled by the soft breaking mass @xmath68 and they are expected to be nearly degenerate if @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "however , with a large @xmath55 , there is a significant mixing between @xmath67 and @xmath71 and the mass spectrum of the stops will be modified .",
    "the two mass eigenstates are repelled from one another by the mixing term and the mass gap between them further increases .",
    "consequently , there is at least one sbottom lighter than the heavier stop .",
    "the spectrum of the stop and sbottom sector has important implications for their decay patterns and collider searches as we will see .    to scan the mssm parameter space",
    "we specify the parameters at the cutoff scale @xmath37 which is taken to be 100 tev .",
    "since we are focusing on the spectrum of the third generation squark ( and neutralino / chargino for the decay patterns ) , we decouple the first two generation of sfermions and third generation sleptons by setting their soft susy - breaking masses to 3 tev .",
    "we also set the gluino mass to 2.5 tev , beyond the current and near future reaches . in order to generate stop masses which are potentially within the lhc run 2 reach , the diagonal stop soft breaking masses @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath72 are varied from 250 gev to 1.4 tev .",
    "the @xmath55 term is scanned from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 as mentioned before .",
    "on the other hand , the right - handed sbottom soft - breaking mass @xmath76 is varied from 100 to 3000 gev . for the higgs sector",
    ", @xmath77 varies from 2 to 50 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath40 varies from 100 gev to 3 tev .",
    "although the @xmath78 and @xmath79 gaugino masses @xmath80 and @xmath81 have little effects in the stop / sbottom spectrum or the higgs boson mass , the presence of the neutralinos and charginos can affect the decay chains of the stop / sbottom .",
    "thus , we let @xmath81 and @xmath80 vary in the ranges of 501500 gev and 250 - 1500 gev respectively .",
    "we use feynhiggs  @xcite to generate the susy spectrum and to calculate the higgs boson mass . given the uncertainties in different approaches in the higgs mass calculation and higher order corrections , we require the resulting higgs boson mass to be bigger than 122 gev as our selection criterion .",

    "we assume that the gluino is heavy enough so that the stops and sbottoms are dominated by the direct pair production .",
    "otherwise the gluino cascade decays would be the strongest probe .    given the spectrum @xmath121 , we can find two main classes of model points depending on whether there are other neutralinos and charginos lying between them .",
    "we denote type a models to have the lightest charginos and the second lightest neutralinos heavier than our second stop , so that they decouple from our discussion , given that their direct pair production rate is much smaller than that of squarks of the same mass . in type b models , the second neutralino and accompanying charginos are lighter than @xmath30 so that they may appear in the cascade decays of @xmath30 .",
    "these neutralinos and charginos may be either wino - like or higgsino - like , or both . from the naturalness point of view , it is preferable to have the higgsinos not too heavy .",
