    "high energy physics ( hep ) is well known for using very sophisticated detectors , status of the art computers , ultra - fast data acquisition systems , and very detailed ( monte carlo ) simulations .",
    "one might imagine that a similar level of refinement could be found in its analysis tools , on the trail of the progress in probability theory and statistics of the past half century .",
    "quite the contrary ! as pointed out by the downhearted zech@xcite ,  some decades ago physicists were usually well educated in basic statistics in contrast to their colleagues in social and medical sciences .",
    "today the situation is almost reversed .",
    "very sophisticated methods are used in these disciplines , whereas in particle physics standard analysis tools available in many program packages seem to make knowledge of statistics obsolete .",
    "this leads to strange habits , like the determination of a r.m.s .",
    "of a sample through a fit to a gaussian .",
    "more severe are a widely spread ignorance about the ( lack of ) significance of @xmath0 tests with a large number of bins and missing experience with unfolding methods \" . in my opinion ,",
    "the main reason for this cultural gap is that statistics and probability are not given sufficient importance in the student curricula : _ ad hoc _ formulae are provided in laboratory courses to report the `` errors '' of measurements ; the few regular lectures on `` statistics '' usually mix up _ descriptive _ statistics , _ probability _ theory and _ inferential _ statistics .",
    "this leaves a lot of freedom for personal interpretations of the subject ( nothing to do with subjective probability ! ) . of equal significance",
    "is the fact that the _ disturbing catalog of inconsistencies_@xcite of `` conventional '' statistics helps to give the impression that this subject is matter of initiates and local gurus , rather than a scientific discipline .",
    "the result is that standard knowledge of statistics at the end of the university curriculum is insufficient and confused , as widely recognized .",
    "typical effects of this ( dis-)education are the _",
    "`` gaussian syndrome '' _ ( from which follows the uncritical use of the rule of combining results , weighing them with inverse of the `` error '' squared , or the habit of calling @xmath0 any sum of squared differences between fitted curves and data points , and to use it as if it were a @xmath0 ) , the abused _",
    "`` @xmath1 rule '' _ to evaluate `` errors '' of counting experiments , using the standard `` error propagation '' starting from @xmath1 and @xmath2 ? ] and the reluctance to take into account correlations , just to remain at a very basic level .",
    "i do nt think that researchers in medical science or in biology have a better statistics education than physicists . on the contrary ,",
    "their usually scant knowledge of the subject forces them to collaborate with professional statisticians , and this is the reason why statistics journals contain plenty of papers in which sophisticated methods are developed to solve complicated problems in the aforementioned fields .",
    "physicists , especially in hep , tend to be more autonomous , because of their skills in mathematics and computing , plus of a good dose of intuition .",
    "but one has to admit that it is rather unlikely that a physicist , in a constant hurry to publish results before anybody else , can reinvent methods which have been reached by others after years of work and discussion .",
    "even those physicists who are considered experts in statistics usually read books and papers written and refereed by other physicists .",
    "the hep community remains , therefore , isolated with respect to the mainstream of research in probability and statistics .",
    "in this paper i will not try to review all possible methods used in hep , nor to make a detailed comparison between conventional and bayesian solutions to solve the same problems .",
    "those interested in this kind of statistical and historical study are recommended to look at the hep databases and electronic archives@xcite .",
    "i think that the participants in this workshop are more interested in learning about the attitude of hep physicists towards the fundamental aspects of probability , in which framework they make uncertainty statements , how subjective probability is perceived , and so on .",
    "the intention here will be , finally , to contribute to the debate around the question _ `` why is nt everybody a bayesian''_@xcite , recently turned into _ `` why is nt every physicist a bayesian''_@xcite .",
    "the theses which i will try to defend are :    * there is a contradiction between a cultural background in statistics and the good sense of physicists , and physicists intuition is closer to the bayesian approach than one might navely think ; * there are cases in which good sense alone is not enough and serious mistakes can be made ; it is then that the philosophical and practical advantages offered by the bayesian approach become of crucial importance ; * there is a chance that the bayesian approach can become widely accepted , if it is presented in a way which is close to physicists intuitions and can solve the `` existential '' problem of reconciling two aspects which seem irreconcilable : subjective probability and the honest ideal of objectivity which scientists have .",
    "some of the points sketched quickly in this paper are discussed in detail in lecture notes@xcite based on several seminars and minicourses given over the past years .",
    "these notes also contain plenty of general and hep inspired applications .",
    "an idea well rooted among physicists , especially nuclear and particle physicists , is that the result of a measurement must be reported with a corresponding _ uncertainty_. what makes the measured values subject to a degree of uncertainty is , it is commonly said , the effect of unavoidable measurement _ errors _ , usually classified as _ random _ ( or _ statistical _ ) and _",
    "systematic_.    uncertainties due to statistical errors are commonly treated using the frequentist concept of confidence intervals , although the procedure is so unnatural that the interpretation of the result is unconsciously subjective ( as will be shown in a while ) , and there are known cases ( of great relevance in frontier research ) in which this approach is not applicable .",
    "as far as uncertainties due to systematics errors are concerned , there is no conventional consistent theory to handle them , as is also indirectly recognized by the iso _",
    "the `` fashion '' at the moment is to add them quadratically if they are considered to be independent , or to build a covariance matrix if not .",
    "this procedure is not justified theoretically ( in the frequentist approach ) and i think that it is used essentially because of the reluctance of experimentalists to add linearly the dozens of contributions of a complicated hep measurement , as the old fashioned `` theory '' of maximum errors suggests doing .",
    "the pragmatic justification for the quadratic combination of `` systematic errors '' is that one is using a rule ( the famous `` error propagation '' formula[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) which is considered to be valid at least for `` statistical errors '' .",
    "but , in reality , this too is not correct .",
    "the use of this formula is again arbitrary in the case of `` statistical errors '' , if these have been evaluated from confidence intervals% variation on a selection cut , or the absolute difference obtained using two assumptions for the systematic effect . ] .",
    "in fact , there is no logical reason why a probabilistic procedure proved for standard deviations of random variables ( the observables ) should also be valid for 68% confidence intervals , which is considered , somehow , an uncertainty attributed to the true value .",
    "these examples show quite well the contradiction between the cultural background on probability and the practical good sense of physicists .",
    "thanks to this good sense , frequentist ideas are constantly violated , with the positive effect that at least some results are obtained .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in simple routine applications these results are very close , both in value and in meaning , to those achievable starting from what i consider to be the correct point of view for handling uncertainty ( subjective probability ) .",
    "there are , on the other hand , critical cases in which scientific conclusions may be seriously mistaken . before discussing these cases , let us look more closely at the terms of the claimed contradiction .",
    "if one asks hep physicists `` what is probability ? '' , one will realize immediately that they `` think they are '' frequentist",
    ". the same impression is got looking at the books and lecture notes they use@xcite . particularly significant , to get an overview of ideas and methods commonly used , are the pdg@xcite and other booklets@xcite which have a kind of explicit ( e.g. @xcite ) or implicit ( e.g. @xcite ) _ imprimatur _ of hep organizations .",
    "if , instead , one asks physicists what they think about probability as _ `` degree of belief '' _ the reaction is negative and can even be violent : `` science must be objective : there is no room for belief '' , or `` i do nt believe something .",
    "i assess it .",
    "this is no a matter for religion ! '' .",
    "on the other hand , if one requires physicists to express their opinion about practical situations in condition of uncertainty , instead of just standard examination questions , one gets a completely different impression .",
    "one realize vividly that science is indeed based on beliefs , very solid and well grounded beliefs , but they remain beliefs ``  in instrument types , in programs of experiment enquiry , in the trained , individual judgements about every local behavior of pieces of apparatus''@xcite .",
    "physicists find it absolutely natural to talk about the probability of hypotheses , a concept for which there is no room in the frequentist approach . also the intuitive way with which they figure out the result is , in fact , a probabilistic assessment on the true value .",
    "try to ask what is the probability that the top quark mass is between 170 and 180 gev .",
    "no one will reply that the question has no sense , since `` the top quark mass is a _ constant of unknown value _ '' ( as an orthodox frequentist should complain ) .",
    "they will simply answer that the probability is such and such percent , using the published value and `` error '' .",
    "they are usually surprised if somebody tries to explain to them that they `` are not allowed '' to speak of probability of a true value .",
    "another word which physicists find scandalous is `` prior '' ( `` i do nt want to be influenced by prejudices '' is the usual reply ) .",
    "but in reality priors play a very important role in laboratory routines , as well as at the moment of deciding that a paper is ready for publication .",
    "they allow experienced physicists to realize that something is going wrong , that a student has most probably made a serious mistake , that the result has not yet been corrected by all systematic effects , and so on .",
    "unavoidably , priors generate some subtle cross correlations among results , and there are well known cases of the values of physics quantities slowly drifting from an initial point , with all subsequent results being included in the `` error bar '' of the previous experiment .",
    "but i think that there no one and nothing is to blame for the fact that these things happen ( unless made on purpose ) : a strong evidence is needed before the scientific community radically changes its mind , and such evidence is often achieved after a long series of experiments .",
    "moreover , very subtle systematic effects may affect the data , and it is not a simple task for an experimentalist to decide when all corrections have been applied , if he has no idea what the result should be .",
    "there is an example which i like to give , in order to demonstrate that the intuitive reasoning which unconsciously transforms confidence intervals into probability intervals for the true value is , in fact , very close to the bayes theorem .",
    "let us imagine we see a hunting dog in a forest and have to guess where the hunter is , knowing that there is a 50% probability that the dog is within 100 m around him .",
    "the terms of the analogy with respect to observable and true value are obvious .",
    "everybody will answer immediately that , with 50% probability , the hunter is within 100 m from the dog . but",
    "everybody will also agree that the solution relies on some implicit assumptions : uniform _ prior _ distribution ( of the hunter in the forest ) and symmetric _ likelihood _ ( the dog has no preferred direction , as far as we know , when he runs away from the hunter ) .",
    "any variation in the assumptions leads to a different solution . and",
    "this is also easily recognized by physicists , expecially hep physicists , who are aware of situations in which the prior is not flat ( like the cases of a bremsstrahlung photon or of a cosmic ray spectrum ) or the likelihood is not symmetric ( not all detectors have a nice gaussian response ) . in these situations intuition may still help a qualitatively guess to be made about the direction of the effect on the value of the measurand , but a formal application of the bayesian ideas becomes crucial in order to state a result which is consistent with what can be honestly learned from data .      the fact that bayesian inference is not currently used in hep does not imply that non - trivial inverse problems remain unsolved , or that results are usually wrong .",
    "the solution often relies on extensive use of monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and on intuition .",
    "the _ inverse _ problem is then treated as a _",
    "direct _ one .",
    "the quantities of interest are considered as mc parameters , and are varied until the best statistical agreement between simulation output and experimental data is achieved . in principle",
    ", this is a simple numerical implementation of maximum likelihood , but in reality the prior distribution is also taken into account in the simulation when it is known to be non uniform ( like in the aforementioned example of a cosmic ray experiment ) .",
    "so , in reality what it is often maximized is not the likelihood , but the bayesian _ posterior _ ( likelihood@xmath3prior ) , and , as said before , the result is intuitively considered to be a probabilistic statement for the true value .",
    "so , also in this case , the results are close to those obtainable by bayesian inference , especially if the posterior is almost gaussian ( parabolic _ negative log - likelihood _ ) .",
    "problems may occur , instead , when the `` not used '' prior is most likely not uniform , or when the posterior is very non - gaussian .",
    "in the latter case the difference between mode and average of the distribution , and the evaluation of the uncertainty from the `` @xmath4 rule '' can make quite a difference to the result .",
    "besides the intuitive use of bayesian reasoning , there are , in fact , some applications in which the bayes theorem is explicitly applied .",
    "this happens when frequentist methods `` do not work '' , i.e. they give manifestly absurd results , or in solving more complicated problems than just inferring the value of a quantity , like , for example , the deconvolution of a spectrum ( `` unfolding '' ) .",
    "nevertheless , these methods are mostly used with a utilitarian spirit , without having really understood the meaning of subjective probability , or even remaining skeptical about it .",
    "they are used as one uses one of the many frequentist `` ad hoc - eries '' , after it has been `` proved '' that they work by mc simulation .",
    "some of the cases in which the conventional methods do not work have even induced the pdg@xcite to present bayesian methods .",
    "but , according to the pdg , a paper published this year@xcite finally gives a frequentist solution to the problems , and this solution is recommended for publishing the results .",
    "let us review the situation citing directly @xcite : `` classical confidence intervals are the traditional way in which high energy physicists report errors on results of experiments .    in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable dissatisfaction  for upper confidence limits  this dissatisfaction led the pdg to describe procedures for bayesian interval construction in the troublesome cases : poisson processes with background and gaussian errors with a bounded physical region .     in this paper , we  use (  ) to obtain a unified set of classical confidence intervals for setting upper limits and quoting two - sided confidence intervals .",
    " we then obtain confidence intervals which are never unphysical or empty . thus they remove an original motivation for the description of bayesian intervals by the pdg . ''",
    "in fact , the 1998 issue of the _ review of particle physics _ still exhibits the bayesian approach ( with the typical misconceptions that frequentists have about it ) , but then it suggests two papers by frequentists@xcite ( `` a balanced discussion''@xcite ) to help practitioners to form their own idea on the subject , and , finally , it warmly recommends the new frequentist approach . it is easy to imagine what the reaction of the average hep physicist will be when confronted by the authority of the pdg , unaware that `` the pdg '' which rules analysis methods is in reality constituted of no more than one or two persons who recommend a paper written by their friends ( as is clear from the references and the cross acknowledgements ) .",
    "one should also notice that this paper claims important progress in statistics , but was in fact published in a physics journal ( i wonder what the reaction of a referee of a statistics journal would have been  ) .    in conclusion , there is still a large gap between good sense and the dominating statistical culture .",
    "for this reason we must still be very careful in interpreting published results and in evaluating whether or not the conventional methods used lead to correct scientific conclusions `` by chance '' .",
    "some cases of misleading results will be described in the next section .",
    "it is well known that the frequentist denial of the concept of probability of hypotheses leads to misleading results in all cases in which the simple `` dog - hunter inversion paradigm '' is violated .",
    "this also happens in hep .",
    "as already discussed , confidence levels are intuitively thought ( and usually taught ) as probabilities for the true values .",
    "i must recognize that many frequentist books do insist on the fact that the probability statement is not referred to the true value .",
    "but then , when these books have to explain the `` real meaning '' of the result , they are forced to use ambiguous sentences which remain stamped in the memory of the reader much more than the frequentistically - correct twisted reasoning that they try to explain .",
    "for example frodesen et al.@xcite speak about `` the faith we attach to this statement '' , as if `` faith '' was not the same as degree of belief  ) ; eadie et al.@xcite introduce the argument saying that `` we want to find _ the range _  which contains the true value @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 '' with probability @xmath6 '' does not imply `` @xmath5 is in that range with probability @xmath6 '' . ] ; and so on .    similarly , significance levels are usually taken as probability of the tested hypothesis .",
    "also this non - orthodox interpretation is stimulated by sentences like `` in statistical context , the words _ highly significant _ mean _ proved beyond a reasonable doubt _ '' .",
    "it is also well known that the arbitrary translation of _",
    "@xmath7-values _ into probability of the null hypothesis produces more severe mistakes than those concerning the use of confidence interval for uncertainty statements on true values .    let us consider some real life examples of the misinterpretation of the two kinds just described .",
    "you may have heard in past years some rumors , or even official claims , of discoveries of `` new physics '' , i.e. of phenomenology which goes behind the so called standard model of elementary particles .",
    "then , after some time , these announcements were systematically recognized as having been false alarms , with a consequent reduction in the credibility of the hep community in the eyes of public opinion and tax payers ( with easily imaginable long term aftermath for government support of this research ) .",
    "all these fake discoveries were based on considering low @xmath7-values as probability of the null hypothesis `` no new effect '' .",
    "the most recent example of this kind is the so called 1997 `` hera high @xmath8 events excess '' .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations , analyzing data collected at the hera very high energy electron - proton collider in hamburg ( germany ) , found an excess of events ( with respect to expectations ) in the kinematical region corresponding to very hard interactions@xcite .",
    "the `` combined significance''-value _",
    "( readers not familiar with this term may find a concise review in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they are usually not aware of the implications of the fact that the statistical significance takes into account also the probability of unobserved data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "] of the excess was of the order of 1% .",
    "its interpretation as a hint of new physics was even suggested by official statement by the laboratory and by other agencies .",
    "for example the desy official statement was _",
    "``  the joint distribution has a probability of less than one percent to come from standard model nc dis processes''_@xcite ( then it implies `` it has a @xmath9% probability of not coming from the standard model ! '' ) .",
    "similarly , the italian infn reported that _ `` la probabilit che gli eventi osservati siano una fluttazione statistica  inferiore all1% '' _",
    "( then , it implies that `` with 99% probability , the events are not a statistical fluctuation , i.e. new physics '' ! ) .",
    "this is the reason why the press reported the news as `` scientists are practically sure they have found new physics '' .",
    "what i found astonishing is that most of the people i talked to had real difficulty in understanding that this probability inversion is not legitimate .",
    "only when i forced them to state their degree of belief using the logic of the coherent bet did it emerge that most of my colleagues would not even place a 1:1 bet in favour of the new discovery . nevertheless , they were in favour of publishing the result because the loss function was absolutely unbalanced ( an indirect nobel prize against essentially nothing ) .",
    "the second example concerns confidence intervals , and it comes from new particle search .",
    "this has always been one of the main activities of hep .",
    "new particles are postulated by theories and experimentalists look for evidence for them in experimental data .",
    "usually , if the particle is not `` observed '' one says that , although the observation does not disprove the existence of the particle , this is an indication of the fact that the particle is `` too heavy '' . the result is then quantified by a `` lower bound '' at a `` 95% confidence level '' . without entering into detail of how the limit is operationally defined ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , in particular @xcite , to have an idea of the level of complication reachable to solve a simple problem ) , i want to point out that also in this case the result can be misleading .",
    "again i will give a real life example .",
    "a combined analysis of all the lep experiments on the higgs mass concluded recently that _ ``",
    "a 95% confidence level lower bound of 77.5 gev / c@xmath10 is obtained for the mass of the standard model higgs boson''_. this _ sounds as if _ one were sure at 95% that the mass is above the quoted bound .",
    "in fact , most of the people i interviewed about the meaning of the statement , even those belonging to the lep experimental teams , answered `` the higgs boson exists at all , then there is 95% probability that its mass is above the limit '' .",
    "there were also a few people who answered `` if i do a mc simulation of the decay of a 77.5 gev higgs boson , i get in only 5% of the cases the simulation describing the data '' , or `` if there is an higgs boson and its mass is less than 77.5 gev , then the observations of the search experiments have a probability of at most 5% of being correct '' , or something similar . from all of which",
    "it is very difficult to understand , from a logical point of view , why one should be 95% confident that the mass is higher than the bound .",
    "the problem can be solved easily with bayesian methods ( see @xcite for details ) . assuming a flat prior for the mass",
    ", one finds that the value of the lower bound is more or less the published one , but only under the condition that the mass does not exceed the kinematical limit of the studied reaction .",
    "but this limit is just a few gev above the stated lower bound .",
    "thus in order to obtain the correct result one needs to renormalize the probability taking account of the possible range of masses above the kinematical limit and for which the experiment has no sensitivity .",
    "for this reason , in the case of @xcite the probability that the mass value is above 77.5 gev / c@xmath10 may easily become 99.9% , or more , depending on the order of magnitude of a possible upper bound for the mass .",
    "then , in practice these lower bounds can be taken as certainties .",
    "although it is clear that the dominant statistical culture is still frequentism in hep ( and everywhere else ) , i am myself rather optimist on the possibility that the situation will change , at least in hep , and that bayesian reasoning will emerge from an intuitive to a conscious level .",
    "this is not a dream ( although clearly several academic generations are still needed ) if the theory is presented in a way that it is acceptable to an `` experienced physicist '' .    *",
    "first , it is not difficult to get a consensus on the observation that subjective probability is the natural concept developed by the human mind to quantify the plausibility of events in conditions of uncertainty . *",
    "second , one should insist on the fact that bayes theorem is in fact a natural way of reasoning in updating probability , and a philosophical point of view that somebody tries to apply to data analysis[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( see @xcite for details ) . *",
    "bayes theorem is not `` all '' .",
    "it only works in situations where the nice scheme of prior and likelihood is applicable . in many circumstances",
    "one can assess a subjective probability directly ( try asking a carpenter how much he believes the result of his measurement ! ) .",
    "* the _ coherent bet _",
    "(  la de finetti@xcite ) forces people to be honest and to make the best ( i.e. `` most objective '' ) assessments of probability .",
    "* it is preferable not to mix up probability evaluation with decision problems .",
    "in other words , the coherent bet should be considered hypothetical .",
    "this makes a clear distinction between our beliefs and our wishes ( the example in section [ ss : hera ] should teach something in this respect ) .",
    "* one may think , navely , that the `` objective bayesian theory '' is more suited for science than the `` subjective one '' .",
    "instead , it seems to me easier to convince experienced physicists that `` there is nothing really that is objective '' , than it is to accept an objective theory containing ingredients which appear dogmatic from the physicist point of view@xcite .",
    "any experienced physicist knows already that the only `` objective '' thing in science is the reading of digital scales .",
    "when we want to transform this information into scientific knowledge we have to make use of many implicit and explicit beliefs ( see section [ ss : beliefs ] ) . nevertheless , the `` honest '' ( but nave ) ideal of objectivity can be recovered if scientific knowledge is considered as a kind of very _ solid networks of beliefs _ , based on centuries of experimentation , with _ fuzzy borders",
    "_ which correspond to the areas of present research .",
    "my preferred motto is that `` no one should be allowed to talk about objectivity , unless he has 10 or 20 years of experience in frontier science , economics , or any other real world application '' .",
    "in particular , mathematicians should refrain from using the word objectivity when talking about the physical world .",
    "* it is very important to work on applications : the simplicity and the naturalness of the bayesian reasoning will certainly attract people .",
    "* many conventional methods can be easily recovered as limit cases of the bayesian ones , if some well defined restricting conditions are valid , as already discussed in section [ ss : ml ] .",
    "for example , when i make a @xmath0 fit i consider myself to be using a bayesian method , although in a simplified form .",
    "this attitude contrasts to that of practitioners who use methods in which the bayes theorem is explicitly applied , but as if it were one of the many frequentist cooking recipes . *",
    "it is important to make efforts to introduce bayesian thinking in teaching , starting from the basic courses .",
    "i am not the first to have realized that the bayesian approach is simple for students .",
    "the resistance comes from our colleagues , who are unwilling to renew the contents of their lectures , and who have developed a distorted way of thinking .",
    "finally , i would like to give a last recommendation .",
    "do nt try to convince a physicist that he already is bayesian , or that you want to convert him to become bayesian .",
    "a physicist feels offended if you call him `` x - ian '' , be it newtonian , fermian , or einsteinian .",
    "but , being human , he has a natural feel for probability , just like everybody else .",
    "i would like to generalize this idea and propose reducing the use of the adjective `` bayesian '' .",
    "i think that the important thing is to have a theory of uncertainty in which `` probability '' has the same meaning for everybody , precisely that meaning which the human mind has naturally developed and that frequentists have tried to kill .",
    "therefore i would rather call these methods _",
    "probabilistic methods_. and i conclude saying that , obviously , `` '' .",

    "<S> the intuitive reasoning of physicists in conditions of uncertainty is closer to the bayesian approach than to the frequentist ideas taught at university and which are considered the reference framework for handling statistical problems . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of intuition and conventional statistics allows practitioners to get results which are very close , both in meaning and in numerical value , to those obtainable by bayesian methods , at least in simple routine applications . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , cases in which `` arbitrary '' probability inversions produce unacceptable or misleading results and in these cases the conscious application of bayesian reasoning becomes crucial . </S>",
    "<S> starting from these considerations , i will finally comment on the often debated question : `` is there any chance that all physicists will become bayesian ? '' </S>"
