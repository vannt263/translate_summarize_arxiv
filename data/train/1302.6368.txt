    "accurate first - principles calculations of electronic excitations in solids are notoriously challenging , because the variational principle , which underlies ground - state schemes like kohn - sham density - functional theory@xcite or quantum monte carlo methods,@xcite can not be exploited in this case .",
    "therefore , many - body perturbation theory,@xcite which is based on green functions and allows an explicit incorporation of relevant coulomb - correlation effects through a summation of the corresponding feynman diagrams , is often the method of choice for quantitative _ ab initio _ descriptions of experimental spectroscopies .",
    "an especially fruitful realization of this framework for actual electronic - structure calculations is the so - called @xmath0 approximation@xcite that yields quasiparticle band structures in much better agreement with photoemission data than density - functional theory with standard local or semilocal exchange - correlation functionals.@xcite from a mathematical point of view , it constitutes an expansion of the exact nonlocal and frequency - dependent self - energy to first order in the dynamically screened coulomb potential @xmath2 , which describes the interaction between two quasiparticles formed by an electron or a hole together with its surrounding polarization cloud .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation is hence particularly suited for materials with weak to medium correlation strength , such as semiconductors or simple metals , but not for strongly correlated systems , where the quasiparticle picture breaks down .    in spite of the undisputed success of the @xmath0 approximation for the prediction of material properties and the interpretation of photoemission measurements ,",
    "the debate over its best practical implementation shows no tendency of abating .",
    "one long - standing controversy centers on the question whether the green function used to construct the self - energy should be evaluated self - consistently or not.@xcite both approaches can be justified : the green function obtained with full self - consistency is the variational solution that makes the luttinger - ward functional@xcite for the total energy within the random - phase approximation stationary,@xcite while the more commonly applied non - self - consistent version follows naturally from the iterative solution of hedin s coupled integral equations for the self - energy with a mean - field treatment as the starting point.@xcite    assessments of different variants of the @xmath0 approximation are typically based on a comparison of the numerical results for selected test systems . however , the adopted numerical procedures and limited computational resources inevitably necessitate additional simplifications whose impact on the final results is not always clear .",
    "for instance , the case studies investigating the effects of self - consistency for real solids reported so far have , in general , only used a restricted form of self - consistency that was limited to the quasiparticle energies in the denominator of the green function,@xcite the quasiparticle orbitals,@xcite or the diagonal part of the green function.@xcite even at the level of the standard non - self - consistent @xmath0 approximation , far - reaching additional simplifications are widely employed . among these",
    "are the pseudopotential approximation , which leads to small but systematic deviations from all - electron results due to the inexact core - valence partitioning and the use of pseudo wave functions,@xcite as well as plasmon - pole models or other simplified screening functions.@xcite a range of less obvious but equally important factors like the proper treatment of anisotropic screening in noncubic systems@xcite or problems resulting from an incomplete basis set in all - electron calculations@xcite have also been emphasized .",
    "one point that has increasingly come into focus in this context is the convergence behavior with respect to the number of unoccupied states included in the construction of the green function @xmath3 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath2 .",
    "much attention was raised after an early all - electron calculation,@xcite which claimed much smaller semiconductor band gaps than established pseudopotential results , was put into question due to alleged incomplete convergence with respect to this parameter,@xcite leading to further detailed studies@xcite that illustrated the slow convergence rate of the quasiparticle energies for a wide variety of materials . as an extreme example",
    ", shih _ _ et al.__@xcite reported that bulk zinc oxide required thousands of unoccupied bands to achieve satisfactory accuracy in a calculation based on pseudopotentials and a plane - wave basis set .",
    "it was subsequently argued that this peculiar behavior was caused by the particular choice of plasmon - pole model used in ref .   and that far fewer bands are in fact required",
    "if the full frequency - dependent screening function is properly constructed within the random - phase approximation.@xcite however , a similarly slow convergence was again observed in an all - electron calculation for zinc oxide that not only avoided plasmon - pole models but also the additional pseudopotential approximation.@xcite parallel to these developments , different approaches were proposed to circumvent or at least alleviate the convergence problem .",
    "these include the replacement of all high - lying empty states by plane waves,@xcite the extrapolar method,@xcite in which merely a small number of unoccupied states are treated explicitly and a common energy denominator is assigned to the remainder , so that the closure relation can be applied , the lanczos - chain algorithm,@xcite as well as the effective - energy technique@xcite and methods based on the self - consistent sternheimer equation,@xcite which are formally exact despite only involving occupied states . while these novel schemes undoubtedly hold great potential , practical applications are not yet widespread , in part because not all popular computer codes support them at present . as a consequence ,",
    "the majority of @xmath0 calculations still rely on traditional procedures and suffer from the problem of slow convergence .",
    "all of the above issues are relevant on the energy scale of several tenths of an electron volt that matters for the comparison between different implementations of the @xmath0 approximation and with experiments , but their control is difficult in practice due to complex interdependencies .",
    "therefore , model systems that permit numerically exact or , ideally , analytic solutions play an important role for developing and testing approximation schemes within many - body perturbation theory , but even the homogeneous electron gas , a frequently employed model in solid - state physics , can only be treated numerically in the @xmath0 approximation . furthermore , with no experimental measurements or independent theoretical benchmark results , even the basic question whether the true occupied band width in the range of metallic densities is smaller than that of free electrons , as predicted by the standard non - self - consistent @xmath0 approximation,@xcite or larger , as obtained when full self - consistency is included,@xcite is not yet finally settled . calculations that go beyond the @xmath0 approximation and attempt to incorporate the combined effects of self - consistency and vertex corrections remain inconclusive , because the results depend on the choice of vertex function and details of the implementation.@xcite in this situation , more tractable few - electron systems are of considerable interest .",
    "the first nontrivial system for which the self - energy at the @xmath0 level can be derived analytically was a hubbard model with four sites in a tetrahedral arrangement and two electrons,@xcite originally used as a counterexample to demonstrate the violation of particle - number conservation in the non - self - consistent @xmath0 approximation before a more general investigation of this problem based on symmetry arguments.@xcite the analytic solvability was important in this case , because it proved unequivocally that the quantitative deviation was genuine and not due to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "a related but even simpler two - site model with a pair of electrons can be treated analytically in the same way.@xcite lattice models with a wider range of parameters , for which the @xmath0 self - energy is accurately obtainable by numerical means , were also employed in several studies.@xcite the properties of hubbard models deviate in many respects from those of real materials , however , and conclusions from such comparisons can not always be directly transferred to the _ ab initio _",
    "realm.@xcite most importantly , the local on - site interaction differs significantly from the actual coulomb potential and leads to a dominance of short - range correlation effects .",
    "these are not well described by the @xmath0 approximation , which mainly accounts for the long - range screening of charge carriers .",
    "furthermore , the restricted hilbert space does not allow us to address problems like the convergence behavior with respect to the number of empty states.@xcite peculiar symmetries , such as that between occupied and unoccupied states in the two - site model at half filling,@xcite which are not obeyed by real solids , may also have an influence on the results . for completeness",
    ", it should be mentioned that the polaron model of individual electrons coupled to an external boson field can also be treated analytically,@xcite but its usefulness as a test system for the @xmath0 approximation is even more limited , as there is no explicit renormalizable electron - electron interaction .    for future methodological investigations",
    "i here propose a better suited continuum system consisting of two electrons confined to the surface of a sphere , and i show that the self - energy within the standard non - self - consistent @xmath0 approximation can be derived entirely analytically .",
    "in contrast to the previously considered hubbard models with the same property,@xcite the electrons interact with the normal long - range coulomb potential , and there is an infinite hilbert space of single - particle wave functions whose eigenvalues are not bounded from above .",
    "therefore , the performance of particular approximation schemes should be more indicative of applications to real systems .",
    "the model considered here can be regarded as a two - dimensional homogeneous electron gas in a closed curved space , whose density depends on the radius of the sphere . as in the three - dimensional electron gas , the correlation is weak at high densities ( small radius ) and becomes strong at low densities ( large radius),@xcite so that different regimes can be explored within the same framework .",
    "the system is also quasi - exactly solvable , which means that some exact eigenvalues , although not the complete spectrum , are known analytically.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the system is mathematically defined and discussed in more detail , before the analytic expression for the self - energy in the non - self - consistent @xmath0 approximation is derived in sec .",

    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec : convergence ] the convergence behavior with respect to the number of empty states is analyzed , leading to an analytic formula describing the asymptotic dependence on the cutoff energy .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . unless otherwise noted , hartree atomic units are used throughout .",
    "the system considered here consists of two electrons on the two - dimensional surface of a sphere with radius @xmath4 .",
    "their positions are expressed in spherical coordinates @xmath5 in terms of the polar angle @xmath6 and the azimuthal angle @xmath7 .",
    "a homogeneous positive surface charge density @xmath8 , which gives rise to the attractive electrostatic potential @xmath9 , is included to ensure overall charge neutrality .",
    "if the self - interaction of the positive charge background is also taken into account , then the hamiltonian becomes @xmath10 with the laplace - beltrami operator on the 2-sphere @xmath11 which is related to the angular - momentum operator @xmath12 .",
    "its eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics @xmath13 the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian-2 ] ) must in general be determined numerically , but for certain discrete radii individual analytic solutions are known.@xcite for example , for the particular value @xmath14 , which corresponds to intermediate correlation strength , the exact ground - state energy for two electrons is @xmath15 .    due to symmetry requirements",
    ", the ground - state electron density is evenly distributed on the spherical surface . in density - functional theory",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian of the auxiliary kohn - sham system thus takes the form @xmath16 with a constant exchange - correlation potential @xmath17 .",
    "the hartree potential is exactly canceled by the electrostatic potential of the positive charge background . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : angular - momentum ] ) the kohn - sham orbitals are @xmath18 where the normalization is chosen with respect to the two - dimensional integral over the spherical surface @xmath19 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath20 are independent of the magnetic quantum number @xmath21 . in the ground state",
    "the lowest spin - degenerate kohn - sham orbital is doubly occupied , whereas all others are unoccupied .",
    "as the eigenvalue of the highest occupied orbital also equals the negative of the ionization potential in exact density - functional theory,@xcite the exchange - correlation potential can be determined from the difference @xmath22 between the ground - state total energy @xmath23 of the true interacting two - electron system and the energy @xmath24 of the corresponding ionized one - electron system , if the former is known .",
    "thus for @xmath25 the exact exchange - correlation potential is @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , for free electrons @xmath17 is set to zero .",
    "analogous to the three - dimensional homogeneous electron gas , these two choices differ only by a trivial energy shift .",
    "the first ingredient required for the construction of the @xmath0 self - energy is the kohn - sham green function . in the following ,",
    "all functions will be projected onto the orbitals ( [ eq : ks - orbitals ] ) , which form a complete set .",
    "the green function is diagonal in this basis , and the diagonal matrix elements @xmath27 are furthermore independent of @xmath21 .",
    "the symbol @xmath28 always denotes a positive infinitesimal .",
    "since the wave function @xmath29 of the only occupied kohn - sham state is constant , the polarization function becomes @xmath30 \\,d\\omega ' \\\\ & = & \\frac{1 - \\delta_{\\ell 0}}{2 \\pi r^2 } \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\omega_\\ell + i \\eta } - \\frac{1}{\\omega + \\omega_\\ell - i \\eta } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definition @xmath31 and a factor 2 for the spin summation .",
    "the representation of the coulomb potential @xmath32 follows from the addition theorem for the spherical harmonics .",
    "it is immediately clear from this formula that the interaction strength grows with @xmath4 while the level spacing between the eigenvalues ( [ eq : ks - eigenvalues ] ) is simultaneously reduced , so that the system becomes more and more strongly correlated with increasing sphere radius . as the polarization function and the coulomb potential",
    "are both diagonal in the chosen basis , the matrix elements of the dynamically screened interaction @xmath33 with the correlation part @xmath34 can be calculated by means of a simple scalar renormalization .",
    "the poles are located at @xmath35 the exchange part of the self - energy , which is frequency independent and equals the nonlocal exchange potential in hartree - fock theory , is obtained as @xmath36 while the correlation part of the self - energy is given by a convolution of the green function and the screened interaction .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath37 with the gaunt coefficients@xcite @xmath38 these overlap integrals are in fact real valued and zero unless @xmath39 .",
    "they are written conveniently in terms of the wigner 3-@xmath40 symbols@xcite as @xmath41 it then follows from the orthogonality relation @xmath42 that the correlation part of the self - energy , like all other quantities considered in this section , is diagonal in the kohn - sham basis and that the diagonal elements @xmath43 are again independent of @xmath21 .",
    "carrying out the remaining contour integration eventually yields @xmath44     of the quasiparticle equation ( [ eq : quasiparticle ] ) for the occupied state ( @xmath45 , above ) and the first unoccupied state ( @xmath46 , below ) for @xmath25 . the solutions of the quasiparticle equation correspond to the intersections with the diagonal @xmath47 ( dashed line ) .",
    "in addition to the actual quasiparticle , marked by a circle , there are an infinite number of satellite resonances for each value of @xmath48.[fig : sigma ] ]    this general formula can now be exploited to derive the self - energy correction of individual orbitals .",

    "altogether , the behavior of the @xmath0 approximation for this model system hence accords completely with its performance for real solids .",
    "the analytic expression ( [ eq : self - energy ] ) for the self - energy derived above includes a double infinite summation over the angular quantum numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 , reflecting the spectral sums over unoccupied eigenstates in the green function and the screened interaction , respectively . in practice",

    "( [ eq : delta - gap ] ) is considered , because the difference @xmath97 is so small that the leading term is almost completely suppressed ; the change resulting from its inclusion would not be discernible on the scale of the figure .",
    "the asymptotic convergence of the energy gap is evidently well described in this way .    in actual _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for real solids , the high computational cost often precludes a convergence to the desired accuracy .",
    "the contribution of the omitted high - lying unoccupied states may be approximately included within the extrapolar method@xcite or the effective - energy technique,@xcite but straightforward extrapolation to arrive at the limiting values would seem the most natural course of action where implementations of these schemes are not available . in practice",
    ", however , a direct extrapolation of the quasiparticle energies has only been attempted very rarely due to uncertainties about the proper asymptotic formula . in ref .",
    "an expression of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of bands and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are fitting parameters , was employed _",

    "is indeed correct .",
    "the suppression of the leading order in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta - gap ] ) also provides an explanation why band gaps are often observed to converge faster than the individual quasiparticle energies .",
    "in this paper i have described a nontrivial model system of two interacting electrons on a sphere for which the self - energy in the @xmath0 approximation without self - consistency can be evaluated analytically .",
    "this corresponds to the standard approach taken in virtually all actual _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "as the relevant characteristics , such as the long - range coulomb potential and the infinite hilbert space , are the same as in real materials , the system appears better suited to explore the properties of the @xmath0 approximation than previously employed analytically solvable lattice models .",
    "indeed , the results presented here demonstrate an analogous performance as for real materials : the @xmath0 approximation corrects the underestimation of the fundamental energy gap in kohn - sham density - functional theory and yields accurate quantitative results for low to intermediate correlation strength , but fails in the strong - correlation regime .",
    "for this reason , it suggests itself as a natural testing ground to study extensions beyond the standard @xmath0 approximation that are designed to describe the self - energy of strongly correlated systems .",
    "even if a purely analytic treatment is then no longer possible , the computational cost will be much smaller than for real materials , allowing a highly accurate evaluation without the apparent artificialities and the parameter dependence of typical lattice models , which have repeatedly been chosen to study the influence of vertex corrections and self - consistency in the past.@xcite    here this system was used to study the convergence of the self - energy with respect to the number of empty states included in the spectral summations .",
    "the results not only confirm previous empirical observations that transition energies converge faster than individual quasiparticle states due to a partial error cancellation , but the asymptotic expansion also demonstrates that the gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied state approaches its limiting value with an error that is , for practical purposes , proportional to the cutoff energy to the power @xmath1 .",
    "although a more general study of the asymptotic behavior is highly desirable , there is no indication that the dependence on the cutoff energy obtained here is due to specific details of this model .",
    "indeed , the truncation error of the quasiparticle band gap in solids appears to exhibit the same exponent.@xcite if confirmed , this would enable practical direct extrapolation schemes with an appropriate fitting function , implying enormous potential benefits for computationally expensive _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "furthermore , if some way was known to determine the relevant prefactor based on general characteristics of the material in question , then even an _ a posteriori _ correction without the ambiguities of numerical fitting procedures would be possible .",
    "such an _ a posteriori _ scheme exists , for example , to extrapolate the self - energy correction of the band gap from the repeated - slab approximation with finite vacuum buffers and three - dimensional periodicity to the limit of an isolated slab , greatly accelerating the convergence of @xmath0 calculations for thin films with respect to the supercell size.@xcite in this sense , it is hoped that the present paper sparks further fruitful work along the same lines .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 approximation for the electronic self - energy is an important tool for the quantitative prediction of excited states in solids , but its mathematical exploration is hampered by the fact that it must , in general , be evaluated numerically even for very simple systems . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i describe a nontrivial model consisting of two electrons on the surface of a sphere , interacting with the normal long - range coulomb potential , and show that the @xmath0 self - energy , in the absence of self - consistency , can in fact be derived completely analytically in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression is subsequently used to analyze the convergence of the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied quasiparticle orbital with respect to the total number of states included in the spectral summations . the asymptotic formula for the truncation error obtained in this way , </S>",
    "<S> whose dominant contribution is proportional to the cutoff energy to the power @xmath1 , may be adapted to extrapolate energy gaps in other systems . </S>"
