    "the co@xmath0 based heusler compounds are of particular interest due to their high curie temperatures and the high magnetic moments per unit cell ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    half - metallic ferromagnets ( hfm ) are predicted to be 100% spin polarized @xcite . in those materials , the majority electrons are metallic whereas the minority electrons are semi - conducting or insulating . a high degree of spin polarization is interesting for various applications in magneto - electronics ( for examples see @xcite ) .",
    "several materials in the class of heusler compounds were predicted to be half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "this work reports about the heusler compound co@xmath0fesi that is found to be , at present , the heusler compound exhibiting the highest magnetic moment as well as the highest curie temperature .",
    "co@xmath0fesi samples were prepared by arc - melting of stochimetric quantities of the pure metals in an argon atmosphere , followed by annealing in sealed quartz tubes at 1300k for 21 days .",
    "the crystal structure of the polycrystalline ingots was investigated by x - ray diffraction and proved to exhibit the correct l2@xmath1 structure . the lattice constant was found to be 5.64by rietveld refinement .",
    "the rietveld refinement allowed for a b2 type disorder of only @xmath5% ( mixing between fe and si ) .",
    "@xmath6fe mbauer spectroscopy was performed to gain additional structural information .",
    "the derived spectrum ( not shown here ) exhibited a single sextet consisting of sharp lines with a width of 0.15mm / s being in the order of the @xmath7-fe line width ( 0.136mm / s ) .",
    "this observation confirms the occupation of a single site for fe and thus a well ordered system .",
    "do@xmath8 like disorder ( mixing of co and fe at x and y sites ) can be excluded from a comparison of the measured ( @xmath9a / m ) and calculated values ( @xmath10a / m for fe in y and @xmath11a / m for fe in x positions ) of the hyperfine field .",
    "low temperature magnetometry was performed using a super - conducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",

    "the measured magnetic moment is an integer within the experimental uncertainty , as expected for a half - metallic ferromagnet .",

    "an additional spectral feature is visible 3.5ev below the l@xmath8 absorption edge of co and a weaker one at the fe l@xmath8 edge .",
    "this feature is related to the l2@xmath1 structure and demonstrates the high structural order of the sample ( it vanishes for b2 like disorder ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments per atom derived from a sum rule analysis @xcite are @xmath16 for fe and @xmath17 for co at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the error arises mainly from the unknown number of holes in the @xmath20 shell and the disregard of the magnetic dipole term in the sum rule analysis .",
    "the orbital to spin magnetic moment ratios are about 0.05 for fe and 0.1 for co. the measured ratio between the fe and co spin moments of 2.1@xmath21 is fully reproduced by the calculated ratio of 2.18 .",
    "a seeming linear dependence of the curie temperature as a function of the magnetic moment is observed in co@xmath0 based heusler compounds as shown in @xcite .",
    "one expects that @xmath22 is highest for those hmf exhibiting a large magnetic moment .",
    "@xmath22 should be above 1000k in co@xmath0fesi with a magnetic moment of @xmath2 . following this suggestion ,",
    "the ferromagnetic curie temperature of co@xmath0fesi was measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) equipped with a high temperature stage .",

    "the low temperature requirement of the instrumental set - up may not be met , in particular if @xmath22 is very high .",
    "differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) is well established to investigate various kinds of phase transitions in solid materials ( for example see : @xcite ) .",
    "here it was used to examine the magnetic phase transition in order to support the curie temperature received by the vsm experiments .",
    "[ fig3 ] compares the dsc signal ( b ) with the derivative of the specific magnetization ( a ) with respect to the temperature ( compare fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "the minimum at @xmath33k in fig.[fig3]a corresponds to the maximum change of the magnetization with temperature . with dsc ,",
    "a pronounced shift of the signal is observed during cooling or heating at about 1017k and 1037k , respectively .",
    "this shift is due to the hysteresis of the dsc method and depends on the temperature gradient @xmath34 .",
    "the signals are attributed to changes of the magnetic properties , as no structural transitions were observed in this temperature range .",
    "therefore , one expects a mean value of @xmath35k for the magnetic phase transition of co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the melting point was also observed by dsc and found to be @xmath36k ( not shown in fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the observation of the magnetic transition by dsc is verified by the comparison of the structures in dsc with the differential magnetization .",
    "the latter is clearly observed at the point of maximum change of the magnetization with temperature .",
    "it is seen that the value obtained by dsc is slightly lower than @xmath22 determined from the vsm measurement . for co@xmath0fesi",
    "one finds it to be only 4.5% below the curie temperature and thus the dsc value may be a simple estimate for @xmath22 if other methods are not available .",
    "the structural and magnetic properties of the heusler compound co@xmath0fesi were reported .",
    "co@xmath0fesi has a lattice parameter of 5.64and crystallizes in the l2@xmath1 structure with very low disorder .",
    "its melting point appears at @xmath37k .",
    "the material is soft magnetic and its specific saturation magnetization of 0.166am@xmath38kg@xmath39 at 0k exceeds the one of pure co by about 9% .",
    "the curie temperature of 1100k is 5% higher than that of pure fe .",
    "the magnetic moment of 6@xmath40 per unit cell points clearly on a half - metallic ferromagnet .    as a practical application",
