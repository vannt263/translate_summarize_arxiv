    "social activities in electronic networks play an increasingly important role in our every - day lives .",
    "we are exchanging important information via electronic mails , wikis , web - based forums , or blogs , and meet new friends or business contacts in internet communities and social network services .",
    "parallel to this growing socialization of the world wide web , the requirements on the electronic services become more ambitious .",
    "huge data quantities have to be processed , user - friendly interfaces are to be designed , and more and more sophisticated computations must be implemented to offer complex solutions",
    ".    this paper studies a special aspect of social network services , the matchmaking problem .",
    "in essence it asks , given a search profile , for advertising profiles matching it best .",
    "this problem is in principle well - known in grid computing , where computational tasks are seeking for appropriate resources such as cpu time and memory space on different computers . in electronic social networks , however , the problem is more general because not only specified attribute ranges are to be compared but more or less vaguely describable interests .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate a mathematical model for the problem of matchmaking of attribute ranges and fields of interests in electronic social networks .",
    "it tackles the following fundamental questions . how can an appropriate system and its data structure be designed ?",
    "how is the mathematical formulation of a matching problem as an optimization problem ?",
    "in particular , what is its search space , what is its objective function ?",
    "whereas the idea to use a fuzzy function to calculate the matching degree of two numerical ranges may suggest itself , how could a function calculating a matching degree of two fields of interest look like ?",
    "one of the central results of this paper is the proposal of a precise definition of such a function computing this matching degree and the presentation of a concrete example .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a definition of electronic social networks",
    "is given in the next section , a mathematical model of the matchmaking problem as an optimization problem is proposed , especially the data structure of search and advertising profiles , the search space , and the matching degree as the objective function .",
    "a short discussion concludes the paper .",
    "a _ social network _ consists of a finite set of actors and the direct relations defined on them .",
    "an actor here may be an individual , a group , or an organization , and the direct relation between two actors indicates that they directly interact with each other , have immediate contact , or are connected through social familiarities , such as casual acquaintance or familial bonds @xcite . thus a social network is naturally represented by a graph in which each node represents an actor and each edge a direct relation .",
    "empirically , the mean number of direct relationships of an individual in a biological social network depends on the size of the neocortex of its individuals ; the maximum size of such relationships in human social networks tends to be around 150 people ( `` dunbar s number '' ) and the average size around 124 people @xcite .    since the popularization of the world wide web in the middle of the 1990 s , there emerged several internet social networks , maintained by social network services such as `` circle of friends '' like friendster ( http://www.friendster.com[_www.friendster.com_ ] ) , myspace ( http://www.myspace.com[_www.myspace.com_ ] ) , or orkut ( http://www.orkut.com[_www.orkut.com_ ] ) , as platforms for business professionals like xing ( http://www.xing.com[_www.xing.com_ ] ) , or virtual worlds like second life ( http://www.secondlife.com[_secondlife.com_ ] ) .",
    "internet social networks are instances of electronic social networks .    in this paper , an _ electronic social network _",
    "is defined as a network of at least three human individuals or organizations which use essentially , albeit not exclusively , electronic devices and media to get in contact and acquaintance , to meet new partners , to communicate , and to exchange information .",
    "examples of electronic social networks are internet social networks , as well as videoconference sessions and conference calls , especially if they serve to meet new people as in party lines , or as long as they admit spontaneous communication between each member of the network .",
    "in computer science , the term _ matching _ in general refers to the process of evaluating the degree of similarity or of agreement of two objects .",
    "each object is characterized by a set of properties or attributes , which in many systems are given by name - value pairs @xcite .",
    "matching plays a vital role in many areas of computer science and communication systems . for instance , it is studied for resource discovery and resource allocation in grid computing where matchmaking services are needed to intermediate between resource requesters and resource providers @xcite .",
    "other examples are given by the problem of matching demands and supply of business or personal profiles in online auctions , e - commerce , recruitment agencies , or dating services .",
    "in most matching problems , the objects under consideration take asymmetric roles , viz .",
    ", some try to _ search _ for information or request for a service , others try to _ advertise _ information or provide a service .",
    "a single object may naturally do both activities at a time , in electronic social networks this even is the usual case . in the sequel we will therefore more accurately consider the matching of a _ search profile _",
    ", containing the requested information , and an _ advertising profile _ presenting the provided information .    given a specific search profile , the _ matchmaking problem _ then is to find those advertising profiles which match it best , in a sense to be specified in the sequel .",
    "generalizations of this problem ask for best global matchings , given a whole set of search profiles and a set of advertising profiles .",
    "for instance , the _ global pairwise matchmaking problem _ seeks pairs of search / advertising - profiles such that the entity of the pairs matches the best under the constraint that any profile is member of at most one pair , the _ global multiple matchmaking problem _",
    "searches for possibly multiple combinations of search and advertising profiles which as a whole match the best .",
    "the pairwise version of the problem typically occurs for dating services or classical marriage matchmaking tasks , whereas the multiple version appears in grid computing or in brokering interest groups .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the local version of the matchmaking problem , i.e. , finding an optimum advertising profile to a specified search profile .",
    "thus the matchmaking problem is an optimization problem , and to formulate it precisely we have to specify the search space and the objective function .",
    "the search space will turn out to be the set of pairs of the fixed search profile and the advertising profiles , and the objective function will be a function measuring the `` matching degree . ''",
    "we will work out these notions in the next sections .      a _ profile _ consists of its owner , being an actor of the electronic social network , a list of _ attributes _ of a given set @xmath0 together with their values , a list of _ attribute stencils _ where each stencil represents a pair of an attribute name and its value range , and a list of _ fields of interest _ specifying their respective levels of interest .",
    "attributes are properties of the profile owner such as age , height , weight , eye color , or hair color . and",
    "we therefore subsume them under the class `` owner '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig - uml - matchmaking ] ) .      +   +   +   +    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]           +   +   + * stencil * +   +   +    in principle , there are two different types of attributes , subsumed in the two disjoint sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that the set @xmath0 of attributes separates as @xmath3 the set @xmath1 consists of the _ numerical attributes _ of the owner which take integer or real numbers as values , the set @xmath2 consists of discrete non - numerical values .",
    "( the difference between numerical and non - numerical is not sharp , for instance a string could well be considered as numerical via a symbol code , as well as non - numerical since it seldom makes sense to multiply or divide strings ; in most cases , strings are better considered as non - numerical . )",
    "correspondingly , the stencil of an attribute is determined by the attribute s name and its range , being of a certain set called _ type _",

    "@xmath13 @xmath4 contains only one element , say @xmath14 , then the stencil is often shortly written `` @xmath15 '' instead of `` @xmath16 . ''",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath17 $ ] then we may write `` @xmath18 '' instead of @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , `` height = 180 '' means `` height @xmath13 @xmath20 $ ] , '' or `` height > 180 '' means `` height @xmath13 @xmath21 $ ] . ''    on the other hand , a field of interest is a name - value pair specifying the field itself as well as its level ranging on a scale from @xmath22 to 1 , coded by the interpolation of the following table , @xmath23 the set of fields of interests is denoted by @xmath24 and is a subset of words of a specified alphabet @xmath25 , @xmath26 usually , @xmath25 is the set of ascii or unicode symbols .",
    "the set @xmath24 determines the set of all fields of interests available to the system .",
    "depending on the system design , it may be a fixed set of words , or an arbitrary word over the alphabet @xmath25 .",
    "given a set @xmath27 of search profiles @xmath28 and a set @xmath29 of advertising profiles @xmath30 as input , the search space @xmath31 of a _ global _ matchmaking problem is given by all pairs of search and advertising profiles , i.e. , @xmath32 in this paper , however , we are considering the local matchmaking problem , given a single search profile @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath33 , and the search space @xmath34 where @xmath35 a search profile @xmath28 itself is a set of the given attribute stencils @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and of fields of interest @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the set of attribute - range pairs , with the given mapping @xmath41 from the set @xmath42 of the searched numerical attributes to their associated desired ranges ( @xmath43 associates to each numerical attribute @xmath44 in @xmath42 an interval @xmath45 $ ] ) , @xmath46 is the set of attribute - set pairs , with the mapping @xmath47 from the given set @xmath48 of searched discrete attributes to their desired sets or enums , ( @xmath49 associates discrete nonnumerical attribute @xmath44 a set @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 is the set of searched fields of interest with their desired levels , with the given mapping @xmath52)$ ] . note that each of the pairs @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 can be easily implemented as a table or a hash map .",
