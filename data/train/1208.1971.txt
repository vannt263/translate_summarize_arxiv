    "in this paper , we analyze the variational problem associated with the large deviations principle for semimartingale reflected brownian motion ( srbm ) in the octant . the srbm processes of interest arise from heavy traffic limits of queueing network processes .",
    "understanding the tail asymptotics of the srbm s can aid in computing their stationary distribution , which in turn gives insight into the behavior of the pre - limit queueing processes .",
    "the typical analysis of large deviations for any process can often be divided into two steps : ( 1 ) proving a large deviations principle ( ldp ) and ( 2 ) analyzing the resulting variational problem . for particularly complex variational problems , one might further subdivide step ( 2 ) into : ( 2a ) characterizing optimal paths and ( 2b ) optimal path computations .",
    "our primary interest in this paper is in step ( 2a ) , especially for srbm s in @xmath0 . to gain understanding of the difficulties of the overall investigation",
    ", we briefly review some previous results .",
    "first , with respect to step ( 1 ) , an ldp for srbm s in @xmath1 has only been established for special cases . for a general dimension @xmath2",
    ", majewski examined the special cases of srbm s arising from feed - forward queueing networks @xcite and srbm s whose reflection matrix is an @xmath3-matrix ( the so - called harrison - reiman case ) @xcite .",
    "dupuis and ramanan @xcite obtained an ldp for a generalization of the harrison - reiman case .",
    "it should be noted that these results still leave the ldp for @xmath4 unresolved for some parameter cases ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "more recently , dai and miyazawa @xcite obtained exact asymptotics for srbm in two dimensions using moment generating functions and techniques from complex analysis .",
    "however , the results are limited to asymptotic behavior along a ray of the quadrant . in a related follow - up paper , dai and miyazawa @xcite",
    "provide new insights into the results of avram et al .",
    "@xcite and derive exact asymptotics for the boundary measures of srbm in two dimensions .",
    "the tasks outlined for step ( 2 ) are best explained by examining the case in two dimensions . in this",
    "setting , avram et al .",
    "@xcite and harrison and hasenbein @xcite gave a complete analytical solution to the variational problem for any srbm of interest ( e.g. , those possessing a stationary distribution ) .",
    "the analysis was carried out in a few steps .",
    "first , three general properties of optimal paths were established : convexity , scaling , and merging .",
    "second , these properties were used to conclude that only three types of optimal paths are possible . finally , these path properties allow the development of a complete algebraic description of the optimal paths in two dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , the situation in three dimensions is considerably more difficult",
    ". while the properties of convexity , scaling , and merging still apply , they are nowhere near sufficient to characterize the possible optimal paths . in order to attack the higher dimensional problem",
    ", we examine a special set of srbm cases and develop new techniques for restricting the types of paths which must be examined .",
    "more specifically , in this paper we investigate the variational problem associated with srbm in the positive orthant for @xmath5 in the case in which the srbm has either _ rotationally symmetric _ or _ mirror symmetric _ data ( the latter is a special case of the former ) .",
    "note that neither symmetry case we analyze coincides with the much studied case of _ skew - symmetric _",
    "srbm s , which have tractable product form stationary distributions .",
    "our first contribution is to use the bramson , dai , and harrison @xcite stability results to derive an appealingly simple set of stability conditions for rotationally symmetric srbm ( see theorem [ srbm_stable ] in section [ sec : stable ] ) .",
    "however , the main contribution of the paper is to clarify the nature of optimal paths in three - dimensional variational problems and to provide new techniques to achieve this analysis .",
    "to best elucidate our contribution , we present our main result now :    [ thm : main ] consider a rotationally symmetric variational problem , as given in definition [ def : rsvp ] , arising from srbm in @xmath6 .",
    "suppose @xmath7 and @xmath8 . under condition 1 in section [ sec",
    ": finite ] , there always exists an optimal path which is either ( a ) a gradual path ( a path which moves through faces of strictly increasing dimension ) or ( b ) a classic spiral path .",
    "theorem [ thm : supergradual ] establishes part ( a ) and theorem [ thm : ex ] establishes part ( b ) .",
    "an important consequence of this result is the following :    for the variational problem arising from srbm in the octant , there exists an example of an optimal spiral path .",
    "this follows from theorem [ thm : main ] and the calculations in section [ sec : optspiral ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time a spiral path has been shown to be optimal for this type of variational problem .",
    "condition 1 is somewhat complicated and we discuss it in detail later .",
    "the most important restriction it imposes is that the srbm must have reflection vectors which point `` outward . ''",
    "we believe that this condition can be relaxed .",
    "note that the negativity condition on the drift @xmath9 is not restrictive , since it is equivalent in our case to requiring stability of the associated srbm .",
    "an implication of these results is that they provide the basis for tractable numerical methods for computing optimal paths in three dimensions .",
    "complementary to our work is a recent paper by el kharroubi et al .",
    "@xcite , which provides some algebraic results for paths in three dimensions .",
    "however , most of the results in @xcite require _ a priori _ elimination of certain optimal path types , which we are able to provide .",
    "important related computational methodology appeared in majewski @xcite .",
    "if one fixes the maximum number of segments in the search for an optimal path , majewski s branch - and - bound algorithm can efficiently produce the desired path .",
    "finally , farlow @xcite also investigates variational problems arising from rotationally symmetric srbm .",
    "in particular , she provides evidence that spiral paths can not be optimal unless @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , her arguments , when combined with our results , indicate that there are always spiral optimal paths in such cases .",
    "our hope is that the path properties we establish can be extended beyond the symmetry cases .",
    "however , it should be noted that the general case in three dimensions is already known to be fairly complex and in fact our main results do not hold for all parameter cases in three dimensions . in @xcite , the authors show that an optimal path to a point in the interior of the octant may have up to five linear pieces , implying that a simple characterization of paths in the general @xmath5 case is non - trivial . this five - piece path is depicted in figure [ fig : kavita ] ( in the figures in this paper ,",
    "dotted lines indicate a segment contained in the interior of the octant ) .     +    nonetheless , we believe that deriving new properties of optimal paths for special cases is a necessary building block for solving other variational problems , and provides for a better understanding of the tail asymptotics for srbm .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : vp ]",
    "we introduce the variational problem ( vp ) analyzed throughout the paper .",
    "this problem arises from studying large deviations of srbm in the orthant , concepts that are described in section [ sec : srbm ] .",
    "section [ sec : rsvp ] introduces the symmetric cases of the srbm and vp which are of interest to us . in section [ sec : stable ]",
    ", we use the framework of bramson et al .",
    "@xcite to derive the stability conditions of symmetric srbm .",
    "the next three sections characterize the nature of ( piecewise linear ) optimal paths with a finite number of segments .",
    "section [ sec : exotic ] is devoted to paths with an infinite number of pieces and it is demonstrated that only classic spiral paths can be optimal .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : optspiral ] we provide an example of a spiral path that is indeed optimal .",
    "in this section , we define the variational problem of interest in this paper .",
    "first , we give notation and definitions which follow as closely as possible to those given in avram et al . @xcite .",

    "finally , for vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 we define the inner product @xmath20 and the associated norm @xmath21 .    in order to more easily define the vp ,",

    "other results require that the covariance matrix @xmath14 is the identity .",
    "the covariance condition seems more difficult to remove , since this matrix could affect the types of paths that are optimal for a given srbm . as noted earlier ,",
    "it is already know that our results can not be generalized to arbitrary ( stable ) srbm data .",
    "the example in @xcite which was discussed in the introduction is particularly troubling because the reflection matrix in that example is partially rotationally symmetric ( two of the three reflection vectors exhibit rotationally symmetry ) .    in addition , even once one has a handle on the types of paths which are optimal , computation and comparison of these path costs appear still requires considerable effort .",
