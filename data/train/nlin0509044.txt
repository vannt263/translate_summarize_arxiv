    "recently , nonlinear hamiltonian lattice dynamical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom have become a focal point for a variety of application areas @xcite .",
    "several diverse physical contexts in which such models ( typically discrete in space and continuous in the evolution variable ) arise are ( i ) spatial dynamics of optical beams in coupled waveguide arrays arising in nonlinear optics @xcite , ( ii ) temporal evolution of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices in soft - condensed matter physics @xcite and ( iii ) dna double strand in biophysics @xcite .",
    "a prototypical model , applicable to different degrees of approximation , in all of the above contexts is the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "this model was first proposed in @xcite and implemented for the first time experimentally in refs .",
    "a systematic presentation of the experimental results in optical systems is given in a recent work @xcite ; for bec - related experiments , see @xcite .",
    "in this model , self - localized excitations ( discrete solitons ) are possible as a result of the interplay between the kerr nonlinearity and discrete linear coupling .",
    "many properties of optical discrete spatial solitons have been systematically explored in theory and experiment , including generalizations to diffraction management @xcite , diffraction - managed solitons @xcite , and soliton transport and gating @xcite .    on the other hand , a topic that has received considerably less",
    "attention has been the study of vector analogs of the dnls equation .",
    "a number of studies have addressed the existence and stability of diverse families of solitary waves / localized states in the dnls equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these issues have also been studied for both cubic and quadratic nonlinearities @xcite in one and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , the first experimental realization for such a system occurred rather recently @xcite ( see also the very recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "this work sheds new light on the theoretical investigations of this topic , in that the relevant model for the corresponding algaas waveguide array experiment included four wave mixing ( fwm ) terms that were rarely included in previous theoretical studies .",
    "subsequent studies ( see @xcite ) addressed a number of specific properties of the model system put forward in @xcite .",
    "such properties related to switching , instability - induced amplification , modulational instability as well as an analysis of the energy barrier between stable discrete solitary waves centered on a lattice site versus two lattice sites .",
    "the focus of the present study is to extend the analysis of the vector nls lattice system incorporating fwm which is relevant to the experiments of @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we provide a systematic analysis of the existence and stability requirements of the principal solitary wave modes of the system .",
    "in so doing , we have found that the concept of the anti - continuum limit ( in which the coupling between waveguides is absent ) provides a powerful tool for the study of the existence and stability concerning these solutions .",
    "subsequently , continuations in the coupling parameter are used to construct a full two - parameter bifurcation diagram that gives the complete picture of stability for both one - component as well as `` mixed '' mode solutions ( involving both components ) .",
    "we note that all of the results obtained via our dimensionless model can be directly placed in the context of the experimental results obtained in refs .",
    ".    the remainder of the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical model of interest as well as proposing a setup that allows for analysis of the existence and stability of the model s solutions . in section iii , we fully analyze the relevant solutions and their stability in the anti - continuum limit ( i.e. , zero coupling between adjacent waveguides ) . in section iv",
    ", we proceed numerically to determine solutions to the model for nonzero coupling and observe how the bifurcation points and stability features are modified for this case .",
    "the instability regions obtained in section iv are then monitored through direct numerical experiments in section v. finally , in section vi , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "following @xcite , we will use the dimensionless model @xmath0 in these equations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the appropriately normalized , slowly - varying , complex field envelopes for the transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized waves respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively associated with the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) and were evaluated in @xcite to be approximately equal to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . wherever possible ,",

    "the dimensionless power @xmath9 is connected with its dimensional analog @xmath10 ( measured in watts ) according to @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the dimensionless coupling @xmath12 used in @xcite was @xmath13 .",
    "this is crucial since it serves to highlight differences between the results obtained in the computational analysis of @xcite and the generalization of the corresponding results presented herein .",
    "more generally , we take @xmath12 to be a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "we note that @xmath12 is related to the dimensional coupling constant , @xmath14 , given in @xcite , via @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath14 is measured in @xmath16 .",

    "@xcite , the range of parameters used in their computations appear to correspond to the case of @xmath23 .",
    "this is verified by our analysis below .",
    "again , this is highlighted to account for the disparities of some of the conclusions obtained in @xcite with the ones their generalizations presented in the following sections .    to perform linear stability computations , provided that an exact solution @xmath24 of the stationary eqs .",
    "( [ req3])-([req4 ] ) has been obtained ( either analytically in the anti - continuum limit , or numerically for @xmath25 ) , we use the perturbation ansatz : @xmath26 in this ansatz , @xmath21 is a ( small ) formal expansion parameter and @xmath27 is the eigenfrequency of the perturbation eigenvector @xmath28 ( where the superscript denotes the transpose ) . then , upon lengthy but straightforward calculation , one obtains the linearized matrix eigenvalue problem to o@xmath29 .",
    "these dynamical equations have the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 the @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the size of the lattice ) blocks of the linearization matrix are given by : @xmath34 in the above , the short - hand notation @xmath35 , invoking the concept of the discrete laplacian @xmath36 . with this linearized matrix eigenvalue problem",
    ", we can establish a criterion for the existence and stability of solutions to this system by examination of our system at the anti - continuum limit ( i.e. , when @xmath37 ) .",
    "we begin by examining eqs . @xmath38 for the case @xmath12 = 0 . setting @xmath39 and @xmath40 in this case ,",
    "one finds : @xmath41 from the above , we infer that for solutions to exist in this limit it is necessary for @xmath42 to be an integer multiple of @xmath43 , hence , we obtain that @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the simplest possible solutions are the ones that involve only one of the two branches and were hence termed te and tm modes respectively in @xcite .",
    "the te solution of eqs .",
    "( [ req23])-([req24 ] ) has the form ( in the present limit ) @xmath46 and exists only for @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , the tm mode features @xmath48 and is only present for @xmath49 .    also , there are two possible mixed mode solutions permitted by the quantization condition of eq .",
    "( [ req25 ] ) , allowing the exponential of eqs .",
    "( [ req23])-([req24 ] ) to be @xmath50 or @xmath51 respectively .",

    "( [ req23])-([req24 ] ) has the general solution : @xmath53 if @xmath54 ( which is the case in the experimentally relevant setting ) , this branch only exists for @xmath55 and @xmath56 [ the sign of the two above inequalities needs to be reversed for existence conditions in the case of @xmath57 . among the two conditions , in the present setting",
    ", the second one is the most `` stringent '' for the case @xmath58 , which yields the constraint @xmath59 ( while the first condition requires for the same parameters @xmath60 ) .    the second possibility for a mixed mode ( stemming from @xmath61 in eqs .",
    "( [ req23])-([req24 ] ) ) yields the , so - called , elliptically polarized mode ( ep ) @xcite , involving a @xmath62 phase shift between the te and tm components . the relevant amplitudes in this case are : @xmath63 the condition for this branch to exist if @xmath64 is @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( once again the signs should be reversed if @xmath67 ) . in this case , the first condition is more constraining than the second , imposing for our special case of interest herein ( @xmath58 ) @xmath68 ( while the second condition only requires @xmath69 ) .",
    "we can now turn to the study of the stability of the corresponding branches via the anti - continuum limit ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the major advantage of this limit is that all the blocks of the linearization matrix @xmath70 now become diagonal .",
    "furthermore , the structures that we consider , per the branches presented above , involve the excitation of a _ single site _",
    "( all other sites are inert ) with amplitudes corresponding to the appropriate te , tm , lp or ep modes . the interesting byproduct of this formulation is that all inert sites end up yielding purely diagonal entries in the stability matrix equal to @xmath71 in the first ( 2n-1)@xmath72(2n-1 ) blocks and @xmath73 in the second set of ( 2n-1)@xmath72(2n-1 ) blocks . hence the matrix will have @xmath74 eigenfrequencies equal to @xmath71 and equally many eigenfrequencies of @xmath73 .",
    "the remaining @xmath75 matrix will correspond to the _ single excited site _ of the lattice and its eigenvalues will yield the eigenfrequencies pertaining to the corresponding branch of solutions .",
    "hence , by solving this considerably simpler eigenvalue problem , we can infer the full stability picture for @xmath25 from the anti - continuum limit .",
    "this , we believe , is a major advantage in using this approach .",
    "we note that due to the fact that the power is conserved for our system ( see previous section ) , two of the relevant eigenvalues of this @xmath75 problem should be identically 0 .",
    "this is confirmed in the computations presented here .",
    "now , taking the case for the `` te '' mode in eqs.@xmath76 , we determine the remaining pair of eigenvalues in this case : @xmath77 examining our model for the experimental case , @xmath3 = 1 , @xmath4 = 1/2 and @xmath78 , we find that this eigenfrequency is real for @xmath79 , while it is imaginary for @xmath80 ( hence , implying the presence of an instability , since the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath81 becomes real and exponential growth occurs @xmath82 ) . indeed",
    ", we can show that for the te mode , stability is ensured for @xmath83 .    for the tm mode",
    ", the corresponding expression can be obtained as : @xmath84 and for the case of interest , stability is ensured for @xmath85 , while instability ensues ( due to a real eigenvalue ) for @xmath23 .    for the lp mode ,",
    "the expression for the corresponding eigenfrequency is too cumbersome to provide in analytic form ( even though such a form has been obtained ) for general @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence , we will restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath58 , where the relevant eigenfrequency reads : @xmath86 implying stability for @xmath59 ( which coincides with the branch s existence region ) .",
    "finally , for the ep mode , the expression similarly reads : @xmath87 implying , in principle , stability for @xmath68 ( again , coinciding with the solutions domain of existence ) ; see , however , the discussion below for this branch .    from the above observations , one can put together the complete bifurcation picture of the four branches and their corresponding stability in the anti - continuum limit ( again , we present this here for concreteness for @xmath58 ) . more specifically , the te branch exists for @xmath88 and is stable for @xmath89 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the branch is destabilized as a new branch emerges , namely the lp branch , through a pitchfork bifurcation ; notice that the tm component of this branch , per eq .",
    "( [ req29 ] ) is exactly zero at @xmath90 , hence it directly bifurcates from the te branch .",
    "the two branches of this super - critical pitchfork correspond to the two signs of @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ req29 ] ) .",
    "the bifurcating branch `` inherits ''",
    "the stability of the te branch for all larger values of @xmath20 , while the latter branch remains unstable thereafter .    in a similar development",
    ", the tm branch exists for @xmath92 and is stable in the interval @xmath93 .",
    "however , at @xmath94 , a new branch ( in fact , a pair of branches ) bifurcates acquiring non - zero @xmath95 , beyond the bifurcation point , as per eq .",

    "one of the key features that will help us in our analysis of the finite coupling case consists of determining where the bands of the continuous spectrum of the linearized problem occurs .",
    "this is obtained analytically using the plane wave ansatz @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "plugging our ansatz into the coupled linearized problem ( essentially , using eqs . @xmath100 and ignoring the nonlinear terms ) , the resulting dispersion relations are @xmath101 hence the continuous spectrum ( in the infinite lattice case ) will consist of the frequency intervals @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] . as may be expected , for @xmath104 , these intervals degenerate to two single points ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) , in consonance with the discussion of the previous section .",
    "but perhaps more importantly , for @xmath107 ( equivalently for @xmath108 ) , the continuous spectrum branch will be crossing the origin , leading to the collision of the eigenvalues with their mirror symmetric opposites , that will in turn lead to instabilities .",
    "hence , we need _ only _ consider couplings in the interval @xmath109 $ ] .    we now numerically examine each of the main four branches , using one - parameter continuation in the above - mentioned interval of @xmath12 s for different values of @xmath20 and thus constructing a two - parameter bifurcation diagram for each branch .",

    "in fact , the anti - continuum limit has provided with a very effective tool to _ analytically _ highlight existence and stability properties of the different branches as well as potential instabilities .",
    "we have continued this monoparametric picture ( as a function of the propagation constant of the solutions , but at zero coupling ) to finite coupling fleshing out the regimes of stability and instability , and of existence as well as of disappearance of the relevant branches of solutions .",
    "the relevant two - parameter diagrams ( fig .",

    "[ rfig3 ] for the tm , fig .",

    "[ rfig5 ] for the ep mode ) constitute the main result of the present paper .",
    "we have , however , complemented our existence and stability analysis with direct numerical `` experiments '' , illustrating the different instability scenario for the modes of interest and how they can either lead to the excitation of other branches , or even to the complete annihilation of the relevant localized waves .",
    "it is noteworthy that the process of obtaining such a multiparametric bifurcation picture has allowed us to reveal a considerably deeper understanding of the system s parameter space , in comparison to earlier publications ( such as e.g. the theoretical conclusions of the works of @xcite ) . in particular , for instance , the limited parameter space examined in the latter setting ( where a monoparametric continuation was used for @xmath13 and apparently varying @xmath20 only for @xmath23 ) led the authors to infer that the tm mode is _ always _ unstable and similarly that the bifurcating ep mode is _ also _ unstable . here",
    ", we have illustrated explicitly regions of stability of each of these modes in the parameter space of the system ( which definitely exist for lower values of the coupling ) .    finally , while the recent investigations of the various principal branches have offered a rather substantial understanding of their properties , there are multiple directions of future interest in this topic that also appear within experimental reach .",
    "such examples consist e.g. of the study of two - dimensional waveguide arrays and of discrete solitons @xcite and vortices @xcite in them .",
    "another such example is the study of more elaborate , multi - site constructions , such as twisted modes @xcite even in one spatial dimension . while the above directions of examination of stationary states are of interest in their own right , an additional dimension of relevance revealed by our direct instability simulations of section v pertains to the systematic study of the existence and stability of breathing excitations due to their principal role in the system s dynamics .",
    "such investigations are currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",
