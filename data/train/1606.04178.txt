    "let @xmath1 be an isotropic unimodal lvy process on @xmath2 with the lvy  khintchine exponent @xmath3 .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , the estimates of the transition densities @xmath4 were studied under the assumption that @xmath3 has lower and upper matuszewska indices strictly between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , more detailed information can be obtained whenever stronger assumption about the behaviour of @xmath3 is imposed .",
    "namely , in @xcite , it is proved that if @xmath3 varies regularly at infinity with index @xmath7 then @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 moreover , the asymptotics implies that @xmath3 varies regularly at infinity with index @xmath7 .",
    "a similar result was proved also for @xmath3 regularly varying at the origin .",
    "the natural question arises : what are the asymptotic behaviour and estimates of the semigroup for the endpoints @xmath11 .",
    "regarding estimates , the case @xmath12 was investigated for subordinate brownian motions in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "however , the case @xmath13 seems to be hardly studied . in (",
    "* theorem 5.52 ) there are estimates of @xmath14 for small values of time variable for a geometric stable process , that is when @xmath15 for some @xmath16 . to the authors best knowledge the asymptotics were never studied before .",
    "this article is an attempt to fill that gap in the theory .",
    "we provide a solution for a large class of slowly varying symbols including geometric stable and iterated geometric stable cases .",
    "namely , we study processes with symbols belonging to de haan class @xmath17 associated with a function @xmath18 slowly varying at infinity , for definition see .    for an isotropic unimodal lvy process @xmath1 on @xmath2 with the lvy ",
    "khintchine exponent @xmath19 , which is equivalent to regular variation with index @xmath20 at the origin of the density of lvy s measure of the process ( see theorem [ thm:5 ] ) , we derive several asymptotic results describing the behaviour of the transition density @xmath21 and the green function @xmath22 . to be more precise , in section [ sec:3 ] , we prove that @xmath23 we also study @xmath24 the density of the lvy measure of the process @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , implies that @xmath26 for the green function @xmath27 of @xmath25 , if the process is transient ( what always holds if @xmath28 ) , we show that @xmath29 in particular , extends the result of @xcite where the geometric stable and iterated geometric stable cases were studied .",
    "we also investigate the asymptotics of @xmath14 when @xmath30 gets large provided @xmath18 is a slowly varying bounded function . in corollary [ cor:2 ]",
    "we show that @xmath31 we want to emphasize that if @xmath32 is sufficiently small then @xmath33 may be _",
    "this new phenomena requires an additional factor not present in the case when @xmath3 is regularly varying at infinity with index strictly larger than zero .",
    "we also obtain the corresponding results when the lvy ",

    "namely , @xmath35 and @xmath36    moreover , we prove several estimates of the transition density and the green function under various assumptions for unimodal and isotropic processes which improve the existing results for subordinate brownian motions .    if the lvy ",

    "khintchine exponent is slowly varying at infinity    there are many articles exhibiting the local behaviour of the transition density of lvy processes for small time and space variables which are valid under certain assumptions on the density of the lvy measure , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "namely , if @xmath46 is comparable at the origin with a decreasing @xmath47 having the matuszewska index at the origin strictly between @xmath5 and @xmath6 then there are positive @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath48 one of our contributions is to discover that for processes with the lvy  khintchine exponent belonging to de haan class associated with a bounded function slowly varying at infinity the rle of @xmath49 is taken by @xmath50 . to illustrate the results we provide examples with slowly varying symbols to which our method applies .",
    "these examples suggest that a unified form of estimates may be difficult to discover within the class of processes with slowly varying symbols since the estimates exhibit quite a lot of irregularity .    in the case of subordinate brownian motions",
    "we prove some extensions of the results of @xcite where estimates of @xmath4 were obtained in terms of the symbol @xmath3 of the process under weak scaling assumptions .",
    "namely , @xmath3 satisfies lower and upper scaling conditions at infinity with indices strictly between @xmath5 and @xmath6 if and only if there is @xmath37 such that for all @xmath51 and @xmath39 , if @xmath52 then @xmath53 let us recall that for a subordinate brownian motion we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a bernstein function which determines the distribution of the underlying subordinator via laplace transform .",
    "it turns out that suitable weak scaling properties imposed on the derivative @xmath56 lead to the following extension of , there is @xmath57 such that for all @xmath51 and @xmath58 , if @xmath59 then @xmath60 the last result is particularly interesting when @xmath3 is slowly varying at infinity since can not hold in this case .",
    "moreover , under some additional assumptions on the subordinator we can also show the converse .",
    "that is , if is satisfied then @xmath56 has some scaling properties .    for subordinate brownian motion",
    ", the case when @xmath3 is regularly varying at @xmath61 with index @xmath6 , a function @xmath62 plays a similar rle as @xmath63 in this article . for details",
    "we refer to the recent paper @xcite where the estimates were obtained under suitable scaling assumptions of @xmath64 .",
    "we can conclude that our present paper together with @xcite shed some light on the situation when the lvy ",
    "khintchine exponent @xmath3 is slowly varying or @xmath6-regularly varying at infinity .",
    "these cases seem to be more complicated and still far from being completely understood .",

    "we also study the asymptotics of the green function at the origin and at infinity . in section [ sec:5 ] ,",
    "we derive general upper and lower bounds for @xmath4 and the green function under various assumptions , usually involving scaling properties of some functions determined by @xmath3 .",
    "next , for subordinate brownian motion we show two - sided estimates of the resolvent kernel @xmath65 under assumptions on scaling properties of the derivative of the laplace exponent of the subordinator .",
    "then we use the obtained estimates to derive estimates of @xmath4 .",
