    "it is generally accepted that super - string theory compactified down to four space - time dimensions furnishes a description of curved backgrounds as non - vanishing expectation values of massless string excitations ( moduli ) and reproduces einstein s general relativity ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the first logical step in this derivation is thus compactification of six extra dimensions , followed by the low energy limit , in which only massless modes survive , and by the small coupling limit :    * superstring theory in 9 + 1 dimensions *    @xmath0    * compactification * : @xmath1    @xmath0    * low energy * : massive modes decouple    @xmath0    * small coupling * : @xmath2    @xmath0    * sigma model in 3 + 1 curved space - time : *    @xmath3 \\label{s}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the metric field ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 an antisymmetric field ( the axion potential ) , @xmath7 the string length , @xmath8 the world - sheet minkowski metric tensor , @xmath9 the levi - civita symbol in 2 dimensions ( @xmath10 stand for other fields ) .",
    "then one assumes the above steps do not destroy conformal symmetry on the world - sheet and obtains a set of constraints on the fields in the action .",
    "those constraints can be derived as equations of motion from an effective action in which the string degrees of freedom @xmath11 have formally disappeared and a new ( scalar ) field @xmath12 is required :    @xmath0    * conformal invariance of @xmath13 on the world - sheet *    @xmath0    * renormalization group equations for the fields @xmath4 , @xmath6 ,  *    @xmath14    * effective action in the string frame ( @xmath15 ) : *    @xmath16 % \\ , \\label{s_s}\\ ] ]    where we have now included the action for an electro - magnetic field .    the field equations are ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath4 , @xmath20 the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath12 the dilaton field , @xmath21 the electro - magnetic coupling constant and @xmath22 the dilaton coupling constant ( @xmath23 for string theory ) .",
    "the electro - magnetic energy - momentum tensor is @xmath24    the name of this picture is justified by the fact that the uncompactified degrees of freedom of the string @xmath25 move along geodesics of the metric @xmath4",
    ".    the latter action can be further modified by rescaling the metric    @xmath0    * conformal transformation : *    @xmath26    @xmath0    * effective action in the einstein frame : *    @xmath27 \\label{s_e}\\ ] ]    the new field equations then read ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath19 is the curvature of the metric @xmath30 , @xmath20 the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath30 , @xmath31 the planck length , @xmath32 a constant .",
    "the dilaton is unchanged and the physical ( covariant ) components of the electro - magnetic field are the same in both frames .",
    "however , the uncompactified degrees of freedom of the string do not move along geodesics of @xmath30 and the scalar curvatures differ because of the dilaton : @xmath33    which frame is more suitable as a description of the present state of our universe is an open question which will eventually be settled by experiment .",
    "the issue of conformal transformations in theories of gravity is well known ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the extensive review @xcite ) and was first raised in the context of the low energy string theory in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although it can be proven that the two frames are dynamically equivalent ( the conformal transformation ( [ conf ] ) is canonical @xcite ) , it is clear that ( at most ) one of the metrics involved can be used to compute the distances and related quantities which are actually measured in the experiments .",
    "a common view is that strings follow geodesics of @xmath4 , while `` ordinary '' particles are expected to follow geodesics of @xmath30 .",
    "if real particles are made of strings , a contradiction arises because the two kinds of trajectories do not coincide in general , nor are they related by a change of coordinates . a possible way out of this paradox is that in one frame the corresponding metric gives distances with respect to a fixed reference length ( which one might take to be the compton wave - length of massive matter fields ) and a fixed interval of time ( _ e.g. _ , the inverse of the frequency of some basic nuclear process ) , while in the other such reference length and time interval are locally deformed due to the extra force given by the dilaton .",
    "hence , the tests described below are meant to unveil the nature of `` ordinary '' matter : if matter retains stringy aspects and the basic length and time units at our disposal are truly constant , one should find the values computed in sf ; on the other hand , if the ef turns out to be a good framework , then one could infer that ordinary matter is subject to an extra force or perhaps question the physical relevance of string theory .",
    "this issue has already been extensively discussed in the framework of scalar - tensor theories of gravity and observable consequences have been deduced mainly in cosmology @xcite . because of the direct coupling between the dilaton and matter ( in our case the electro - magnetic field ) , both actions in eqs .",
    "( [ s_s ] ) and ( [ s_e ] ) fail to be of the brans - dicke type , thus the equivalence principle does not hold in general ( it can be reinstated in places of the universe where the dilaton becomes massive due to higher order corrections in @xmath7 @xcite ) .",
    "one sees the equivalence principle is violated whenever the gradient of the dilaton field is not negligible and there are at present strong constraints from observation on the magnitude of such violations .",
    "however , these constraints might be ineffective provided the violations occurred far in the past , _ e.g. _ in the early stages of the universe , or take place in regions of space which have not been tested directly , _ e.g. _ near black hole ( horizons ) , the latter being regarded as excitations of extended objects @xcite .",
    "here we list some of the known solutions ( either exact or in some approximation ) of the field equations ( [ eq_e ] ) in the einstein frame for @xmath34 which can be used to describe black holes with adm mass @xmath35 and are parameterized by the values of the electric charge @xmath36 and the angular momentum @xmath37 :    i ) : :    @xmath38 : * janis - newman - winicour * ( exact @xcite ) .",

    "since the relation between sf and ef is given by a conformal transformation of the metric , eikonal paths followed by null rays are the same in the two frames , as are the deflection angles of light scattered by the black hole .",
    "in particular , for knd this means that , to lowest order in @xmath111 , light rays are not affected by the dilaton @xcite .",
