    "the notion of spin liquid state was introduced thirty years ago when p. fazekas and p.w .",
    "anderson first postulated that due to the frustrated antiferromagnetic coupling the mott insulating state on triangular lattice does not break the spin - rotational symmetry@xcite .",
    "the discoveries of high temperature superconductivity and other novel correlated many - body phenomena have stimulated wide interest in spin liquids both theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "for correlated electrons in two - dimensional cu - o plane , the most two important energy scales are the kinetic energy and the on - site coulomb repulsion . however , as far as the magnetic properties of a mott insulator is concerned , the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange do play an important role@xcite .",
    "recently , f.c .",
    "zhang showed that within the gutzwillar approximation , a quantum phase transition from a mott insulator to a gossamer superconductor(which was first proposed by r.b .",
    "laughlin@xcite ) at half - filling can take place as the on - site coulomb repulsion is reduced @xcite .",
    "it was further anticipated that away from half - filling , this gossamer superconducting state can evolve smoothly into the resonant - valence - bond ( rvb ) spin - liquid phase .",
    "a basic model for investigating the rvb or gossamer states is the so - called t - u - j model@xcite .",
    "it is an extended hubbard model by explicitly including an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction . while in two dimensions",
    "it remains challenging to accurately solve this model , it may be instructive to study the corresponding one - dimensional system .",
    "the one dimensional t - u - j model is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath4 this hamiltonian is not merely a toy model motivated by the corresponding two dimensional system , it is also relevant to quasi - one - dimensional correlated physics .",
    "for example , most of the bechgaard salts ( the ( tmtsf)@xmath5x family of quasi - one - dimensional conductors ) show close proximity of spin - density - wave(sdw ) , spin - peierls , ferromagnetic , and superconducting phases by varying pressures@xcite . to investigate the coexistence of triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism in a class of quasi - one - dimensional materials , japaridze et al studied the model for ferromagnetic exchange with easy - plane anisotropy in the large - bandwidth limit @xcite . as a byproduct , they predicted a transition to the dimerized ordering phase in the case of weak anisotropy by assuming spin - charge separation in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "comparatively , what was less understood is the generic feature of the phase diagram in the u - j plane for the isotropic antiferromagnetic model([tuj ] ) .    at the first glance , the situation with",
    "generic @xmath6 might be trivial . because in the atomic limit there is no explicit frustration between the pair - wise interactions @xmath7 and @xmath0 , the system is simply a mott insulator with gapless spin excitations .",
    "this is in contrast to another well - known one - dimensional model system , i.e. , the conventional extended hubbard model(cehm ) with the on - site(@xmath7 ) and nearest neighbor site(@xmath8 ) coulomb interactions . in the cehm",
    ", the pair - wise interactions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are frustrated explicitly , and in the atomic limit , the system is a charge - density - wave(cdw ) insulator for large @xmath8 and a sdw insulator for large @xmath7@xcite . however",
    ", if the on - site repulsion @xmath7 is reduced , the virtual hopping processes may affect the spin physics in mott insulators .",
    "for example , the recent studies have shown that even within the cehm there exists a new phase in between the cdw and sdw phases .",
    "the new phase is characterized by the bond - charge - density - wave(bcdw ) order or spontaneous dimerization with gapped charge and spin excitations in a narrow window extending from the weak to intermediate coupling regimes@xcite .",
    "usually , such an insulating phase is caused by the electron - phonon coupling or explicit frustrations , but now it is caused by the electronic correlations only . with this kind of bcdw phase in mind , we are going to examine the phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) in order to clarify the competing mott insulator physics in one dimension if the double occupation is allowed .    in the present work",
    ", we study the phase diagram of the half - filled one - dimensional t - u - j model by using analytical and numerical methods , depending on the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "it is found that the ground state is always a mott insulator at half filling and a metal away from half filling .",
    "however , the spin excitations have been dramatically changed by the exchange term .",
    "there is a gapped spin liquid phase characterized by the bcdw order when the exchange interaction is fairly stronger than the coulomb repulsion at arbitrary filling .",
    "the spin gap stems from the interplay between the kinetic energy and the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction . as spin - charge couplings increase and",
    "the bandwidth decreases , the gapped spin liquid phase will be suppressed .",
    "all these reveal a new scenario for the creation of spin gaps in a single itinerant electron chain with translational and spin rotational symmetries and without explicit frustrations @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the phase diagram at half filling in the weak - coupling regime @xmath10 . in this regime , the bosonization technique may be used reliably@xcite .",
    "we linearize the spectrum and pass it to continuum limit by substituting @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the right / left - moving bosonic fields . introducing charge and spin bosonic fields , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively ,",
    "the hamiltonian density of the bosonized model is then given by @xmath15 . here",
    ", the charge and spin sectors are described by @xmath16 with @xmath17 for @xmath18 respectively .",
    "while , the spin - charge coupling part is given by @xmath19 here , in order to compare the t - u - j model with the cehm , we follow the weak - coupling @xmath20-ology approach and adopt the notation of the ref.@xcite . in the lowest orders of @xmath7 and @xmath0 , the scattering matrix elements are @xmath21,@xmath22 , @xmath23,@xmath24 , @xmath25,@xmath26 , and @xmath27,@xmath28 .",
    "the renormalized velocities and luttinger couplings of charge and spin sectors are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , respectively . the coupling constants @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath34 denote the amplitude of the backward and the umklapp scattering of opposite spins , given by @xmath35,@xmath36 respectively .",
    "@xmath37/@xmath38 ( and @xmath39/@xmath40 ) come from the backward ( and umklapp ) scatterings of the parallel / opposite spins , respectively , given by @xmath41 to the lowest order in @xmath0 .",
    "the low - energy properties of the one dimensional t - u - j model in the weak - coupling regime depend on the scaling behavior of these coupling constants during the scaling @xmath42 .",
    "tha is , the coupling constants run in terms of the following one - loop renormalization group(rg ) equations @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "notice that the su(2 ) symmetry in the spin sector ensures @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . from these rg equations",
    ", one finds that @xmath48,@xmath49 and @xmath50 are marginal with the scaling dimension 2 , while @xmath39 and @xmath51 are irrelevant with the scaling dimension 4 .",
    "so , we may first neglect @xmath52 , assuming spin - charge separation in the weak - coupling regime . in this case",
    ", one obtains the rg flows of @xmath48 , @xmath49 from @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath50 from @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "since both @xmath7 and @xmath0 are positive and @xmath56 , @xmath49 is always relevant and flows to the strong - coupling fixed point @xmath57 .",
    "this indicates the existence of the charge excitation gap at half - filling .",
    "the charge gap is given approximately by @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "for the spin excitations , @xmath50 will flow to @xmath60 if @xmath61 , or to @xmath62 if @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the latter case occurs when @xmath64 and in this case a spin gap is expected to open .",
    "the spin gap is given approximately by @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "now , we examine how the spin - charge coupling part @xmath52 affects the phase boundary . as @xmath7 and @xmath0 increase ,",
    "the @xmath39 coupling first becomes less irrelevant in terms of the one - loop rg equations ( [ grho])-([grhos ] ) .",
    "however , because @xmath49 grows with increasing @xmath67 and dominates over the other couplings , the charge excitations are always gapful .",
    "below the charge - gap energy scale the @xmath68 field is locked at @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we may re - scale the cosine term in spin sector , by introducing @xmath70 .",
    "the one - loop rg equation for @xmath71 is obtained simply by @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the spin - gap transition line is shifted to @xmath73 . to obtain the phase transition line ,",
    "we follow the same strategy introduced in the ref.@xcite and solve eqs.([grho])-([grhos])numerically by looking at which of the couplings @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath39 becomes relevant , in our case , @xmath49 grows with increasing @xmath67 faster than the others .",
    "we stop the integration once @xmath49 reaches 1 and calculate @xmath70 .",
    "the positive(negative ) @xmath71 leads to the spin gapless(gapful ) state . here",
    ", the vertex corrections to the scattering matrices are not included .",
    "although they are indeed crucial for the presence of the narrow bcdw phase in the cehm@xcite , their effects are limited in the weak - coupling regime only and may be negligible in the t - u - j model .",
    "the phase boundary obtained by this way is shown by the solid line in fig.1 .    to characterize the gapped spin liquid phase",
    ", we examine via a quasi - classical analysis for four kinds of the order parameters , the sdw , cdw , bcdw , and bond - sdw(bsdw ) parameters , defined by @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . upon bosonization",
    ", they are written in terms of bosonic fields as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 respectively . neglecting the spatial variations of the fields we focus on the following effective potential @xmath82 the couplings @xmath83 are all effective ones obtained by integrating out high - energy degrees of freedom . as the charge gap exists everywhere at half - filling and",
    "is always large than the spin gap(@xmath84 increases faster than @xmath85 ) , both the bsdw and cdw orders are unfavorable in the ground state .",
    "so in the insulating phase , the sdw and bcdw orders compete each other , with the effective potential @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "it is the sdw(or bcdw ) which dominates in the ground state for @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) .",
    "therefore , the sdw - bcdw transition line determined by quasi - classical analysis is the same as that of the spin - gap transition line @xmath73 given above . in fig.(1 ) , the deviation of the phase boundary from the straight line @xmath90 with increasing @xmath0 is due to the @xmath39 coupling which in turn enhances sdw order .",
    "we believe that the existence of the spin gap is a generic feature of the t - u - j model , not limited in the weak - coupling regime only . to further clarify the physics behind the spin - gap ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the unconstrained t - j model , namely the t - u - j model with @xmath91 , in the strong coupling limit @xmath92 . in this case",
    ", one can first bosonize the heisenberg exchange term and taking the hopping term as a perturbation . in the pure heisenberg model ,",
    "the spin excitation is critical but the charge excitation is completely suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , the charge field @xmath93 should be introduced in the bosonization of the heisenberg term since charge fluctuations are now allowed . for the pure heisenberg model , @xmath94",
    "is pinned to @xmath60 . however , by introducing a small but finite @xmath95-term , @xmath94 will become finite .",
    "this will reduce the charge gap and at the same time induce effectively a backward scattering term in the spin sector . as a result of this backward scattering , a spin gap will open .    the discussions in the preceding section and the previous paragraph showed the existence of the spin gap in both the weak and strong coupling limits in the unconstrained t - j model .",
    "to examine whether this is true in the intermediate coupling regime @xmath96 , we have calculated numerically the zero - field spin susceptibility using the transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) at half - filling .",
    "the tmrg handles directly an infinite lattice system .",
    "it does not have any finite lattice size effect and allows a small excitation gap to be accurately determined without invoking the finite size scaling@xcite .",
    "this is an advantage and the reason for us to use this method here .",
    "the error comes mainly from the truncation of basis states in the tmrg iteration .",
    "2 shows the tmrg result of the uniform spin susceptibility for @xmath97 and @xmath91 . in the tmrg calculation ,",
    "100 basis states were retained and the maximum truncation error is less than @xmath98 .",
    "as can be clearly seen from the inset of the figure , the spin susceptibility drops exponentially at low temperatures .",
    "this exponential decay of the susceptibility is a direct consequence of the spin gap .",
    "so far , we have established the existence of the gapped spin liquid phase in the weak / strong - coupling regimes and at a special point in the intermediate regime .",
    "now we try to see the generic feature of the phase boundary in the u - j plane .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the phase boundary is very closed to the line @xmath99 in the weak - coupling regime , but goes below it as @xmath0 increases , due to the spin - charge couplings .",
    "we anticipate that the critical line develops a maximum in the intermediate regime , and then approaches zero gradually as @xmath0 goes to infinity , see the dashed line in fig.1 .    to support this picture and to estimate the crossing point , we have also studied the spin - gap transition by investigating level - crossings of the excitation spectra@xcite .",
    "this technique was used to determine the phase boundaries of the cehm by nakamura@xcite with high accuracy from the numerical data of finite - size clusters .",
    "the obtained spin - gap transition line is qualitatively in agreement with fig.1 , the crossing point is about ( 1.3,0.35)@xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly address the subsequences after introducing holes into the system . in the weak - coupling regime and away from half filling , the terms resulting from the umklapp scattering in @xmath100 and @xmath52 disappear",
    ". the other terms are still present but their coupling constants become doping dependent . to the leading order approximation , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the doping concentration . due to the absence of the umklapp scattering , the charge gap collapses",
    ". however , the backward scattering of spin excitations and the subsequent spin gap phase persist . in the limit @xmath105 and @xmath106 ,",
    "the spin gap phase exists when the condition @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath107 , is satisfied . thus the critical exchange constant increases with increasing doping .",
    "in contrast to the half - filling case , the gapped spin state is now metallic . in this luther - emery - type state ,",
    "the cdw and singlet pairing ( sp ) correlations develop asymptotically as @xmath108 , with @xmath109 being constants of order of 1 . upon doping @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "of course , the cdw correlation is the most dominant one in the luther - emery phase .",
    "in summary , we have studied the one - dimensional t - u - j model analytically and numerically in different coupling regimes . at half - filling ,",
    "the system shows two distinct insulating phases : a gapless spin liquid phase dominated by sdw correlation and a gapped spin liquid phase dominated by bcdw correlation .",
    "the suggested phase diagram is plotted in fig.1 . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the phase boundary line is determined by solving the rg equations .",
    "this line is anticipated to develop a maximum in the intermediate regime and tends to zero at the strong coupling limit .",
    "if @xmath7 is larger than a critical value ( which is estimated about @xmath112 , see ref.@xcite ) , the gapped spin liquid no longer exists , irrespective of the magnitude of @xmath0 . after doping ,",
    "the gapped spin liquid phase becomes the luther - emery phase where the charge gap is completely suppressed while the spin - gap persists .",
    "it is remarkable that in the t - u - j model the spin - gap behavior resembles to that of the frustrated t - j@xmath113-j@xmath5 model@xcite but with a quite different mechanism and the charge gap behavior resembles to that of the hubbard model but with an enhanced magnitude . in the t - u - j model ,",
    "the spin gap results from the interplay between the antiferromagnetic exchange and the kinetic energy ( the constraint of no double occupancy is released ) .",
    "the bcdw insulator driven by this mechanism should have a large but finite ratio of the charge gap to the spin gap , @xmath114 .",
    "for the band , kondo and sdw insulators this ratio is unit , 1 - 1.5 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "for the conventional spin - peierls systems , this ratio should be very large .",
    "so , the present bcdw phase may be relevant to a class of quasi - one - dimensional mott - insulators where the charge gaps are only several times larger than the spin ones .",
    "particularly , we expect that the mechanism may be relevant to the bechgaard salts such as ( tmtsf)@xmath116pf@xmath117 where a transition from the spin - peierls phase into the sdw phase by changing pressures was observed@xcite .",
