    "the latter imply that smgs have typical sfr densities of @xmath480m@xmath38yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8 @xcite , well below the @xmath41000m@xmath38yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8 limit based on a theoretical description of the ( dust  opacity ) eddington  limited sf of a radiation pressure  supported starburst on kpc scales @xcite , though exceptions do exist ( e.g. , @xmath4600m@xmath38yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8 in the z@xmath16.3 smg hfls3 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "our high - resolution 880@xmath0 m imaging shows that the sf in gn20 remains sub - eddington on scales down to a few kpc@xmath9 .",
    "an examination of the resolved sf law in this unlensed z@xmath44 galaxy produced a power - law slope of n@xmath12.1@xmath51.0 . while the significant uncertainty on the slope means that it may be only barely steeper than the local linear relation ( e.g. ,",

    "other models of feedback - regulated sf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "closer to that seen here , though it is impossible to differentiate between models given the current observational uncertainties .    when compared with other studies on the @xmath14@xmath15 plane , we find that the gn20 data lie above the sequence traced out by ` normal ' star - forming disk galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with its classification as a starburst ( t14 ) and , given that the co(21 ) data show evidence for a smoothly rotating gas disk ( h12 ) , it implies that the presence of an ordered velocity field is not a clear indication of the presence or absence of intense starburst activity .",
    "the approximate alignment of gn20 and the two ( resolved ) lensed smgs is also notable . given that the conversion factors specifically - derived for the individual cases range from ulirg - like @xcite to slightly above ulirg - like ( gn20 ) to galactic @xcite , this suggests that the dispersion in the sf law is apparently not due solely to choice of @xmath47 .",
    "on the contrary , the gn20 results suggest that the dispersion in the sf law is real , and that smgs can have very high star formation efficiencies on small scales .    if one assumes a universal sf law where the sfr volume density is simply a function of the molecular gas volume density and local t@xmath49 @xcite , then the complexity in the @xmath10-@xmath45 plane should be removed by accounting for t@xmath49 .",
    "studies substituting the global dynamical timescale ( t@xmath56 ) for t@xmath49 in disk galaxies and mergers at low / high - redshift @xcite provided preliminary support for this theory , as t@xmath56 is proportional to t@xmath49 for galactic scales in high surface density galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a complete theoretical framework for a local volumetric sf law , including a model for the local ( star - forming cloud ) t@xmath49 , which allowed them to describe the sf on scales from entire high - redshift galaxies down to individual molecular clouds with a fixed value of @xmath53@xmath10.015 .",
    "figure  [ ks_tff ] demonstrates that our resolved imaging of gn20 is also consistent with this model , extending the evidence for a fixed sfe per free - fall time to include the star - forming medium on @xmath4kpc - scales in a galaxy 12gyr ago .",
