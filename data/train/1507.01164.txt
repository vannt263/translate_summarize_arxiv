    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon captures significant attention nowadays . since the chirality of a triaxial atomic nucleus was first predicted in 1997 by frauendorf and meng  @xcite and identified in 2001 by starosta  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , plenty of achievements have been made .",
    "experimentally , more than 30 candidate chiral nuclei have been found at @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite mass regions .",
    "more details see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "theoretically , many approaches have been come up to investigate nuclear chirality , such as the particle rotor model ( prm )  @xcite , the tilted axis cranking model ( tac )  @xcite , the tilted axis cranking plus random phase approximation ( tac+rpa )  @xcite , the interacting boson fermion - fermion model ( ibffm )  @xcite , pair truncated shell model ( ptsm )  @xcite , projected shell model ( psm )  @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the tac , a microscopical collective hamiltonian was constructed and applied to the unified description of chiral vibration and rotation  @xcite .    due to the successful description of nuclear global properties and exotic phenomena  @xcite , the covariant density function theory ( cdft )",
    "is introduced to investigate the triaxial deformation of chiral nuclei with various configurations .",
    "based on adiabatic and configuration - fixed constrain triaxial cdft , the possible existence of multiple chiral doublets ( m@xmath10d ) , i.e. , more than one pair of chiral doublet bands in one single nucleus , was proposed for odd - odd nucleus @xmath11rh  @xcite .",
    "then more m@xmath10d nuclei were predicted in the other rhodium isotopes  @xcite .",
    "later on , the first experimental evidence for the predicted m@xmath10d was reported in @xmath12ce  @xcite , and also possibly in @xmath13ag  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the m@xmath10d in which different partner bands are of distinct triaxial deformations and configurations , the m@xmath10d phenomenon are expected also with identical configuration , i.e. , not only the yarst and yrare bands but also higher excited bands might be chiral partner bands  @xcite . the energy spectra of m@xmath10d are first presented with rigid and soft cores  @xcite .",
    "then the chiral geometry of m@xmath10d was examined for configuration @xmath1 with constant and spin depended variable moments of inertia at @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that the m@xmath10d indeed can exist in identical configuration .",
    "the chiral geometry of m@xmath10d has been further examined for the configuration @xmath15 at @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the evidence of this type of m@xmath10d was first observed in @xmath17rh  @xcite .",
    "this observation shows that the chiral geometry in nuclear can be robust against the increase of the intrinsic excitation energy .",
    "as mentioned previous , the m@xmath10d with identical configuration has been investigated for the ideal chiral system , i.e. , one @xmath18 proton particle and one @xmath18 neutron hole coupled to a rigid rotor with triaxial deformation @xmath14  @xcite , and its chiral geometry is examined by analyzing the evolution of angular momentum .",
    "thus , it is intriguing and necessary to study the chiral geometry of m@xmath10d with identical configuration in more general cases where @xmath0 deviates @xmath5 .    in this paper ,",
    "the physical observables and chiral geometry of the m@xmath10d with identical configuration are discussed for different triaxial parameters @xmath0 with @xmath1 in prm .",

    "the detailed theoretical framework for prm can be found in ref .  @xcite . in this section , for completeness , some key formulas are presented .",
    "the hamiltonian of prm is @xmath19 in which the collective hamiltonian is @xmath20 where the indices @xmath21 refer to the principal axes in body - fixed frame of reference , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 represent the angular momenta of the total nucleus , core , and valence nucleons .",

    "it has been demonstrated that for the yrast and yrare bands , the @xmath2 staggering is weak in the chiral vibration region , while it is strong in the static chirality region  @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss the electromagnetic transition probabilities for bands 3 and 4 .",
    "the calculated intra- and inter - band reduced magnetic dipole transitions probabilities @xmath2 and electric quadrupole transitions probabilities @xmath3 of bands 3 and 4 by prm are respectively shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] with different triaxial deformation parameters @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the intra - band transition probabilities of the doublet bands exhibit similar tendency .",

    "a strong staggering between bands 3 and 4 can be clearly seen , which means there is an alternative suppression between the intra- and inter- transition as spin increases .",
    "this has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "however , as @xmath0 deviates from @xmath5 , two obvious changes happen .",
    "one is that the staggering becomes weaker and weaker at high spin region when @xmath0 varies from @xmath73 to @xmath74 ; the other is that the suppression of inter - band transitions is gradually relieved at low spin region .",
    "compared with the first partner bands 1 and 2 , for which the staggering when @xmath75 completely disappears  @xcite , the staggering of the second partner bands 3 and 4 still exists at the same spin internal .",

    "it can be seen that in high excited bands , whose excitation energies are larger than 2.0 mev , the situation turns to be complex .",
    "the level density is rather high and neighboring bands are too close to be distinguished",
    ". thus it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to select the chiral doublet bands  @xcite .",

    "discussed above , the wobbling rotor has low angular momentum ( @xmath113 ) , which corresponds to a complicated wobbling energy spectrum  @xcite . with the coupling of the single particles ,",
    "the occupation of proton and neutron at different orbitals further complicates the wobbling energy spectra of triaxial rotor .",
    "in addition , the energy spectra of higher excited states with triaxiality parameters smaller than @xmath47 are also examined .",
    "we note that the triaxial deformation has larger influence on the low lying states than high ones .",
    "when the triaxial deformation parameter varies from @xmath62 to @xmath52 , the complexity of the high energy states still remain .",
