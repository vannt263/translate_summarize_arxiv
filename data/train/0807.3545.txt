    "long - slit spectrographs generally have a good optical throughput .",
    "however , the spatial data is immediately reduced to one - dimension and is dependent on the slit orientation , with most of the light from the galaxy undetected .",

    "can be binned to give radial trends unbiased by a slit orientation .",
    "one notable use of an ifu in this field is the spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae ( sauron ) project @xcite .",
    "the instrument has good spatial resolution allowing the creation of maps for each measured parameter , particularly in kinematics .",
    "however , the spectral range of sauron is limited to four useful line indices ( h@xmath7 , fe5015 , mgb5177 , fe5270@xmath8 ) . from spatial maps of the iron lines , @xcite",

    "the h@xmath7 maps are typically flat , with a strong central peak in a few galaxies , interpreted as recent star formation activity in the core .",
