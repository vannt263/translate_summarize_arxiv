    "much of the work in the canon of physics has been derived under an assumption of isolation , where the system of interest has no interaction with its environment . often , particularly in the classical regime",
    ", this approximation has been successful in generating accurate predictions .",
    "there are however numerous systems whose behaviour can not be explained by their actions in a vacuum @xcite . in these cases stochastic terms",
    "are used , often as an _ a priori _ part of the model ( and without proper justification ) , to capture the effect of the environment .",
    "brownian motion is the most famous case of this technique in classical physics , but quantum physics and its applications have many examples where a similarly careful treatment of external effects is required @xcite .",
    "these systems can collectively be termed _",
    "open dissipative quantum systems _ , and the problem of how to most accurately model them remains an active field of research .",
    "approaches to these systems can be split into two broad categories .",
    "the first method uses the paradigmatic example of a damped system , where the damping is an effective loss - mechanism that approximates the environment s effect and fluctuations are neglected .",
    "a typical example of this is the early work of kerner and stevens on sets of damped harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "the basis of this method in classical , phenomological equations means that it is capable of providing exact solutions for some simple systems , such as the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "these solutions are however undermined by being fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics .",
    "this can be illustrated by the fact that there are no _ time - independent _ hamiltonians that can replicate the equation of motion for a damped oscillator ,    @xmath0    which has frequency @xmath1 and friction @xmath2 .",
    "while there exists a _ time - dependent _ hamiltonian that leads to this equation of motion @xcite , after quantisation the fundamental commutation relation becomes time - dependent @xcite .",
    "this unphysical result means that another approach to dissipative systems , to be detailed below , is the method of choice .    in this approach , pioneered by callen , welton , senitzky and lax",
    ", dissipative systems are modelled as a primary system ( the `` open system '' ) of interest coupled to an explicit secondary system ( the `` environment '' or `` heat bath '' ) which together describe the overall system being modeled ( the `` total system '' ) @xcite . in comparison to the first method ,",
    "this model is lossless when considering the total system , and incorporates both the dissipation _ and _ fluctuations experienced by the open system as a consequence of its explicit coupling to the environment .",
    "combining this model with appropriate approximations ( e.g. weak coupling between the open system and environment ) allows quantum master equations to be derived , which retain the correct behaviour in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "the general scheme then is to treat the coupled systems as a single closed sytem which can be straightforwardly quantised .",
    "the environmental coordinates can then be eliminated in order to obtain an equation of motion for the primary system . in practice the functional form of the environment ( secondary system ) and its coupling",
    "must be chosen subject to several conditions .",
    "for example in the high - temperature classical limit we expect to recover a classical brownian motion .",
    "in addition , if the summation over environmental coordinates is to be exact , yet analytically tractable , the choice of environment is largely restricted to a set of harmonic oscillators , with a bilinear coupling to the open system . a particularly popular model is the caldeira - leggett ( cl ) hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath3    this model couples the open system ( described by the coordinate @xmath4 to an environment of independent harmonic oscillators ( masses @xmath5 , frequencies @xmath6 , and displacement coordinates @xmath7 ) with each oscillator being coupled to the open system with a strength @xmath8 .",
    "the final term is a counter - term included to enforce translational invariance on the system and eliminate quasi - static effects @xcite .",
    "recently , a more general hamiltonian of the combined system ( the open system and harmonic environment ) was introduced @xcite which is only linear with respect to the environmental variables , but remains arbitrary with respect to the positions of atoms in the open system ( this model is detailed in section [ sec : model ] ) . in this",
    "hamiltonian interactions within the environment are not diagonalised .",
    "this is convenient because all parameters of the environment and its interaction with the open system can then be extracted by expanding the hamiltonian of the combined system in atomic displacements in the bath and keeping only harmonic terms , i.e. the open system can be considered as a part of the expansion of the total system .",
    "this rather general choice of total system hamiltonian enables one to derive classical equations of motion [ in the form of the generalised langevin equation ( gle ) ] for the atoms in the open system @xcite and propose an efficient numerical scheme for solving them @xcite .",
    "this method has been recently generalised to the fully quantum case @xcite where it was shown , using the method based on directly solving the liouville equation , that equations of motion for the observable positions of atoms in the open system have the gle form with friction memory and non - gaussian random force terms .",
    "although this method enables one to develop the general structure of the equations to be expected for the open system , this method lacks an exact mechanism for establishing the necessary expressions for the random force correlation functions .    in the study of quantum brownian motion ,",
    "the path integral representation has been perhaps the most fruitful .",
    "some specific successful applications include tunnelling and decay rate calculations ( kramer s problem ) @xcite as well as recent first - principle derivations for the rate of processes in instanton theory @xcite .",
    "in particular the feynman - vernon influence functional formalism @xcite can be used to exactly calculate the effect of the environment on the open system using path integrals .",
    "approximations such as weak coupling between the primary system and environment are no longer necessary .",
    "path integrals also remove the need for an explicit quantisation of the system hamiltonian , as in this formalism quantum - mechanical propagators are represented as phase - weighted sums over trajectories , where the phase associated to each trajectory is proportional to the action of that path in the classical system @xcite .",
    "a useful consequence of this is that the classical limit is easily obtained @xcite , and the quantisation of the system is automatic when choosing this representation . finally , and probably most importantly , bath degrees of freedom can be integrated out exactly if the environment is harmonic and interacts with the open system via an expression that is at most up to the second order in its displacements .",
    "the key simplification of the feynman - vernon approach is that initially the density matrix of the total system @xmath9 can be partitioned ,    @xmath10    i.e. it can be expressed as a direct product of the initial density matrices of the open system @xmath11 and the environment @xmath12 , where each subsystem has equilibriated separately .    in the context of open , dissipative quantum systems ,",
    "much work has been done using this formalism , expanding the methodology of the feynman - vernon influence functional for both exact and approximate results @xcite . using this model , quantum langevin equations for the reduced density matrix",
    "have been rigorously derived using path integrals @xcite .",
    "in special cases , further analytical results have also been obtained by kleinert @xcite and tsusaka @xcite .",
    "generalisations of these results to anharmonic baths produce approximate but more realistic models @xcite , while time - dependent heat exchange can also be exactly included @xcite .",
    "parallel to this is the work of stockburger , exactly deriving a stochastic liouville - von neumann ( sln ) equation , and applying it to two - level systems @xcite .",
    "approaches based on influence functionals have also found use in the real time numerical simulations of dissipative systems @xcite . with this corpus of techniques , path integrals ( and specifically influence functionals )",
    "represent a powerful and flexible formalism that can be used to attack the problem of open quantum systems .",
    "so far , we have been discussing methods based on initially partitioning the total system . the initial condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fv_direct_prod ] ) is however unphysical , as it is impossible in a real experiment to `` prepare '' a quantum system with the interaction between the open system and environment switched off , prior to any perturbation being applied . as a result",
    ", the transient behaviour we predict for perturbations away from a partitioned initial condition will always be spurious due to the artificial equilibriation of each system",
    "if we wish to extract the exact transient dynamics of an open system we must therefore use a more realistic , non - partitioned initial condition .",
    "fortunately , the influence functional formalism has the capacity to naturally generalise the initial conditions of the overall system and environment , rendering the assumption of a partitioned initial state unnecessary .",
    "this possibility was first noted by smith and caldeira @xcite , before being properly explored by grabert , ingold and schramm @xcite , who derived the time dependent expression for the reduced density matrix of an open system where all path integrals associated with the environment are fully eliminated . in this partition - free case ,",
    "the limits on our ability to describe the reduced dynamics via a liouville operator have been derived by karrlein and grabert @xcite . in this work however , no differential equation for the reduced density matrix was derived , and the authors still used a simplified cl hamiltonian .",
    "we also note that a differential equation for the _ equilibrium _ reduced density matrix for the cl hamiltonian was obtained using path integrals in ref .",
    "@xcite and is consistent with our results .    in this paper , we derive , using the path integral formalism , a set of stochastic differential equations for the reduced density matrix of an open system which describe its dynamics _ exactly_. the derived equation does not have the gle form obtained previously in ref .",
    "indeed , it does not have a clearly defined friction term and the stochastic fields it contains are gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , our hamiltonian is identical to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is more general than the cl hamiltonian . using it",
    ", we obtain a system of first order stochastic differential equations over real and imaginary time that exactly describe the evolution of the state of a dissipative quantum system for partition - free initial conditions .",
    "these equations , which we term the extended stochastic liouville equation ( esln ) , represent both a synthesis and extension of the work outlined above , allowing for a simple and exact closed form description of an arbitrary open system evolving from realistic initial conditions .",
    "the derivation of the esln , ( and therefore the paper itself ) will be organised as follows :    section [ sec : model ] details the model employed , and the class of applicable initial conditions . in section",
    "[ sec : influence_functional ] the path integral representation for the density matrix of the primary system will be introduced , along with the influence functional and its explicit evaluation . in section [ sec : the - two - time - hubbard - stratonovich ] the two - time hubbard - stratonovich transformation is applied to the influence functional found in the previous section , introducing the corresponding complex gaussian stochastic fields . section [ sec : the - extended - stochastics ] presents the path integral describing the reduced density matrix of the primary system and the operator esln equations of motion that it implies , which represents the central result of this work .",
    "these equations account for both the generalised hamiltonian and partition - free initial conditions .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] concludes the paper with a discussion of the esln , its connection to previous results and the potential for numerical implementations .",

    "the secondary system ( the environment ) is composed of @xmath18 harmonic oscillators ( with masses @xmath5 ) coupled both internally and with the open system .",
    "the open system may be subjected to time - dependent external fields .",
    "the environment uses displacement coordinates @xmath19 and the interaction between the two systems is linear in @xmath20 but arbitrary in @xmath13 :    @xmath21    this hamiltonian differs from the standard cl hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : caldeira_legget_model ] ) in two important respects .",
    "first , the interaction between the primary and secondary systems is no longer strictly bilinear , but can depend arbitrarily on @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the atomic displacements that form the environment are now coupled to each other as well as the system , with the coupling described by the force - constant matrix @xmath22 .",
    "these alterations will have a material effect on our results .",
    "we also note the counter - term found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : caldeira_legget_model ] ) has been dropped as it is no longer needed , since when the hamiltonian of an arbitrary combined system is expanded in the power series in terms of atomic displacements @xmath19 , this kind of term does not appear . in this sense",
    "our model hamiltonian is the second - order expansion of _ any _ conceivable system - bath hamiltonian .",
    "the density matrix evolves in the usual manner according to the liouville equation :    @xmath23    where    @xmath24\\label{eq : operator_propagator_definition}\\ ] ]    is the corresponding evolution operator .",

    "@xcite is to consider the full interacting system as being allowed to equilibrate with some time - independent hamiltonian @xmath48 before applying any time - dependent perturbation . in this case",

    "real time noises of the same type can already be efficiently calculated @xcite , and the outlook for extending this to include the imaginary time noise is promising . looking forward , a first application of the esln is therefore likely to be a calculation of the time evolution of the density matrix for a simple system coupled to a harmonic bath , and the comparison between approximate partitioned and exact partition - free methods .",
    "the class of problems that this model may be applied to are rather broad .",
    "this includes a two - level spin boson system , coupled to a bath with an arbitrary spectrum @xcite , or the heat exchange between an arbitrary system and a bath with ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this generalisation may also be applied to numerical schemes for anharmonic bath models @xcite , and influence functional simulations of complex systems @xcite .",
    "to summarise , the influence functional formalism has been used to generate two stochastic differential equations that together describe the exact evolution of an open system that begins in coupled equilibrium with its harmonic environment .",
    "the results presented here are an extension to existing frameworks for thermodynamic analysis in the quantum regime , as well as offering a method for accessing the equilibrium states of arbitrary dissipative systems .",
