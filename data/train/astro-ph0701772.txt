    "this state lasts until the temperature is low enough for the neutrino mean free path to become comparable to @xmath9 .",
    "the behavior of the neutrino mean free path , which determines the timescale for the untrapping transition and the onset of the second shock of the supernova , depends in a sensitive way on the microphysics of the hot and dense pns interior .",
    "in particular , if superfluid and superconducting phases of hadronic and/or quark matter are created , the transport properties are affected and the consequences for simulations of core - collapse supernov could be important .    in a scenario where color superconducting quark matter is the preferred state of matter at high density",

    "the kinetics of the phase transition , which eventually proceeds with the release of latent heat and requires a nucleation time scale .",
    "2 .   the possibility that color superconducting phases have large pairing gaps ( @xmath10 mev ) , which affect the transport properties in the pns core .",
    "3 .   the possibility that color superconducting phases have a high critical temperature ( @xmath11 the gaps ) and therefore affect the formation and evolution of pns .    for recent reviews on dense color superconducting",

    "it has also been emphasized that in the presence of a strong magnetic field , neutrinos propagating in hot superconducting quark matter can become collimated ( beaming ) and asymmetric , thus explaining a resulting kick velocity for the pns @xcite .    in the present work we consider a microscopic , albeit schematic chiral quark model of njl type , where the quark masses and pairing gaps are calculated self - consistently at the mean - field level ,",

    "due to the high density in compact stars , strange quarks could exist in their interior .",
    "we therefore consider a grand canonical ensemble with up , down , and strange quark degrees of freedom .",
    "because strange quarks have a relatively high mass , they should arise only at high density .",
    "therefore , at not too high densities , where matter is in a two - flavor state , there should be an excess of down quarks for matter to be charge neutral .",
    "consequently , the difference between the chemical potentials of the up and down quarks can be sufficiently large for muons to be created by weak interactions , @xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to include both electron and muon lepton degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "the @xmath13 lepton is , however , not included , because it is too massive to play a significant role in compact stars .",

    "the coupling constants , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , determine the coupling strengths in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels , which represent current - current interactions in the color singlet scalar meson channel and the scalar color antitriplet diquark channel .",
    "we follow the argument in @xcite concerning the u@xmath27(1 ) symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar isoscalar meson sector , which essentially is that the symmetry breaking is dominated by quantum fluctuations , and we therefore omit the t  hooft determinant interaction . in the following we use the relative coupling strength @xmath28 to parametrize the coupling in the diquark channel . in the choice of the four - fermion interaction channels",
    "we have omitted the pseudoscalar @xmath25 terms , which should be present in a chirally symmetric theory .",
    "these terms do not contribute to the thermodynamic properties of the deconfined quark matter phase at the mean - field ( hartree ) level @xcite , to which we restrict the discussion in the present paper .",
    "after bosonization using hubbard - stratonovich transformations , we obtain an exact transformation of the original partition function ( [ z ] ) .",
    "the transformed expression constitutes the starting point for approximations , defined as truncations of the taylor expanded action functional to different orders in the collective boson fields . in the following , we use the mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",

    "there are no gauge fields that neutralize the color charge dynamically , because the gluons are replaced by effective point - like @xmath25 and @xmath26 interactions .",

    "we find that in the presence of trapped neutrinos , the isospin mismatch induced by the @xmath0-equilibrium conditions is reduced and the 2sc phase becomes more favorable . in particular , the onset of the 2sc phase is shifted to lower densities in the presence of trapped neutrinos .",
    "this result seems to be robust , as it has been found also for inhomogeneous phases of the loff type @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the neutrino trapping effect on the loff phases in the phase diagram with self - consistently determined strange quark masses is an interesting task for future work .",
    "a new result of this study is the systematic analysis of the regions in the quark matter phase diagram that are realised in stable quark star cores .",
    "this analysis is carried out for two different strengths of the coupling in the diquark channel and for two different values of the neutrino chemical potential ,  _ i.e. _ ,  with and without neutrino trapping .",
    "a remarkable finding is that for the initial evolution of a pns , when the neutrinos are trapped , all configurations with a cfl core are unstable . in absence of trapped neutrinos",
    "there are small , isolated regions in the temperature - density plane where stable configurations with a cfl core exists .",
    "a fraction of these 2sc - cfl stars have baryon number twins in the 2sc state .",
    "we suspect , however , that the configurations with a cfl core would be unstable when the influence of a hadronic crust is taken into account .",
    "e.g. _ ,  ref .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of such hybrid star configurations .",
    "all 2sc quark star solutions considered in this work are stable , while the phase border in - between the 2sc and cfl phases marks the endpoint of stability for pns sequences in the plane of central temperature and central quark number chemical potential .",
    "the maximum temperature of pns are estimated to about @xmath151  mev for an entropy per baryon of 3 , which is an upper limit for the entropy generated in the adiabatic compression of the core during collapse of a massive star . for this value of the entropy per baryon",
    ", the temperature in the cfl phase could reach about @xmath152  mev , but the corresponding pns configurations are unstable .    when hot pns cool by neutrino emission and reaches the neutrino opacity temperature , @xmath122  mev ,  _ i.e. _ ,  the temperature where the neutrino mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the quark star core , the neutrinos created by electron capture in the collapse are untrapped .",
    "by calculating and comparing the compact star sequences for different neutrino untrapping scenarios we find that the energy release due to neutrino untrapping ( and/or cooling ) is of the order of 100 bethe .",
    "this process could therefore be important for the inner engine of supernov and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the discussion of superconducting quark matter phases in the present work concerns the stability of pns configurations with a cfl core and a neutrino heating mechanism for the outer core of newborn pns due to the fact that the opacity temperature in ( superconducting ) quark matter exceeds that in nuclear matter .",
