    "the interpretation of arpes experiments @xcite , that the onset of the pseudogap truncated fermi surface at underdoping , is a transition from a conventional bloch band metal to a precursor state of the mott insulator at zero doping , has been confirmed by recent high - field hall effect measurements by badoux et al @xcite and lalibert et al @xcite .",
    "these experiments illustrate the dramatic change in the @xmath0-space fermi surface that occurs without broken translational symmetry .",
    "a key open question is the origin of the instability of the landau fermi surface to such a @xmath0-space transition as the hole density decreases with increasing correlation and the mott state is approached .",
    "note the strong contrast to the case of @xmath1he which remains a landau fermi liquid although the onsite repulsion is much larger .",
    "a @xmath0-space description of strong correlations is very difficult in the presence of the strong interactions connecting all states in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "there is however one example of a mott insulator phase at weak coupling , namely the `` d - mott '' insulator state in the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder @xcite , which has a fully truncated fermi surface caused by strictly short range ( sro ) correlations . in this example",
    "the d - mott insulating behavior is driven by the extra umklapp ( u ) scattering processes present exactly at the @xmath2-filling fermi surface .",
    "short range order appears in both the @xmath3-wave superconducting ( @xmath3sc ) and the commensurate @xmath4 antiferromagnetic ( af ) channels .",
    "the presence of strong and coupled divergences in both these channels can not lead to coexisting long range ordering in both channels .",
    "singlet pairing results in a spin gap which is incompatible with long range af order , which in turn would open a charge gap , incompatible with superconductivity .",
    "this incompatibility does not allow the resulting strongly coupled state to be treated by mean field theory plus fluctuations .",
    "rather the d - mott insulator phase of the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder @xcite can be viewed as a state where both kinds of sro coexist , stabilized by the energy gain from the presence of local correlations in both particle - hole and particle - particle channels .",
    "the physics of this sro is the same as that in a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state that was proposed very early by anderson @xcite as underlying high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "the initial rvb proposal started from an undoped mott insulator and discussed hole doping in a 2d heisenberg @xmath5 model .",
    "but the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder shows that the same physics can appear in 1d at weak coupling under certain circumstances .",
    "this raises the possibility of realizing rvb physics as an instability of a 2d metal as the mott state is approached .    in this paper",
    "we extend this weak coupling ladder approach to the square lattice in 2d and obtain a description of the instability to rvb sro in the pseudogap phase , as the hole density is lowered from the metallic overdoped state .",
    "the theoretical description of such a sro state in 2d is a formidable task .",
    "the early functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations on the 2d hubbard model by honerkamp et al @xcite showed strong growth in u - processes as the onsite repulsion increased at underdoping .",
    "these processes are especially strong for sets of wavevectors on a square surface which joins the antinodal points , enclosing half the brillouin zone .",
    "they labeled this the umklapp surface ( us ) .",
    "a special feature of the 2d square lattice near @xmath2-filling is that presence of this us close by to the band structure fermi surface .",
    "usually elastic u - scattering is present only at isolated points on the fermi surface and as a result can be safely neglected .",
    "the frg flow showed strong enhancements in the @xmath3sc and the af susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong u scattering on the us in such a state , motivated yang , rice and zhang @xcite to propose a simple pairing form for the single particle propagator in the pseudogap phase .",
    "their phenomenological yrz form , incorporating rvb sro , places the pairing gap on the us not the fermi surface , leads to an enhanced energy gap due to u scattering processes .",
    "the yrz propagator has been successfully used to interpret both the arpes @xcite and recent hall effect experiments @xcite .",
    "the challenge to construct a microscopic theory for systems with strictly sro and no broken symmetries , inspired matthias ossadnik @xcite to formulate many - body theory in a wavepacket basis , rather than the standard extended bloch basis used in long range ordered systems .",
    "to this end he introduced the orthonormal wilson - wannier basis @xcite with even and odd combinations of wannier functions .",
    "ossadnik @xcite began by rewriting the many - body hamiltonian in this wavepacket basis and proceeded to obtain a fermionic formulation of the sro groundstate of the 2-leg hubbard ladder at @xmath2-filling , in agreement with the standard bosonization analysis .",
    "he then went on to demonstrate that his wavepacket approach could be straightforwardly generalized to 2d , unlike bosonization techniques .",
    "however , he did not carry through explicit calculations for this case . in this paper",
    "we follow his lead and carry through such calculations in the simplest approximation scheme .",
    "the great advantage of the ossadnik - ww formalism over a real space approach , is that it enables one to directly examine the behavior in @xmath0-space near the fermi energy .",
    "we can describe the opening of an energy gap in the 2-particle spectrum by u - processes in the antinodal region of @xmath0-space .",
    "analogously to the case of the hubbard ladder , the presence of u - processes is the key to turning the superconducting gap at overdoping into an insulating pseudogap at underdoping .    a sro model of fermions",
    "is characterized by short range correlations which decay exponentially at long distances .",
    "ossadnik proposed a useful description of such behavior can be based on coarse graining the real space behavior leading to a lattice of supercells , whose length scales are determined by the range of the strong short range correlations . the long range behavior of the model is determined in the first place by the local excitations in a single supercell and then by inter - supercell interactions .",
    "ossadnik noted that in this approach , the low energy spectrum of the individual supercell plays a crucial role in determining the form of the correlation at long distances .",
    "he illustrated this proposal by examining the contrasting behavior of two 1-dimensional @xmath2-filled hubbard models , the single chain and the 2-leg ladder ( 2ll ) .",
    "in the former case a single supercell has a 2-fold degenerate groundstate and as a result inter - supercell interactions in the supercell lattice lead to a power law decay of long range af correlations . in the case of a 2-leg hubbard ladder",
    ", the supercell has an isolated groundstate with finite gaps to all excitations . as a result",
    "the weaker inter - supercell interactions act only to renormalize the finite magnitude of the single supercell excitation energies .",
    "he concluded that `` a surprising amount of information about the nature of the groundstate is present in the local interaction and excitation spectrum of the local problem in the ww basis '' , i.e. the excitation spectrum of a single supercell .",
    "here we extend this approach to 2-dimensions , motivated by the arpes observations of a partially gapped fermi surface in the pseudogap phase of underdoped cuprates with only sro and no broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "ossadnik based his analysis of the excitation spectrum of the 2ll by using the results of 1-loop rg calculations .",
    "this method is limited to weak interactions .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the 2ll can be solved numerically using the dmrg method at all interaction strengths .",
    "this allows us to extend ossadnik s analysis to more realistic values as will be discussed below .",
    "our goal is to describe qualitatively the evolution in the physics , in particular the evolution of the 1-particle , 2-particle , and spin - flip excitation energies along the us .",
    "alternative approaches have been put forward in a series of papers by sachdev and coworkers @xcite , chubukov and collaborators @xcite and pepin and coworkers @xcite and many others .",
    "they start from the band structure fermi surface and examine the role of u - scattering processes connecting the 8 `` hot points '' , namely the 8 fermi surface points lying on the us .",
    "they examine the possibility that as the hole density decreases below a critical value , coupled instabilities in the sdw and cdw channels can be stabilized in the hubbard and spin fermion models .",
    "they interpret a number of x - ray investigations and scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) experiments in terms of such spatial modulations .",
    "we put forward a different interpretation here , which proposes that the key instability is driven not by a set of `` hot points '' on the original fermi surface , but by a macroscopic reorganization of the @xmath0-space `` fermi surface '' to obtain `` hot lines '' lying on the us , see fig .",
    "[ fig_yrz ] . in a recent paper liu and coworkers",
    "@xcite found that in this underdoped pseudogap state , the transition to superconducting long range order is preceded by a wide temperature region with strong phase fluctuations associated with a soft leggett mode .",
    "further they showed that this scenario explains the giant phonon anomalies reported by le tacon et al @xcite in high - resolution inelastic x - ray experiments on underdoped ybco . in comparing these results on ybco and the recent stm results on bscco @xcite one must recognize",
    "the presence of strong static lattice disorder in the cuo@xmath6 layers in bscco could account for the clear discrepancy between the two sets of experiments .",
    "this difference shows up very prominently when the strongly broadened nmr spectrum of a bscco @xcite sample is compared to the narrow well resolved lines in the nmr spectrum of underdoped yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite .",

    "this change in the `` fermi surface '' can be stabilized by a finite , but not necessarily strong , interaction strength at low energies as demonstrated by the case of cr . in the cuprates as the doping decreases , the strength of the effective low energy repulsion increases , from zero in the landau fermi liquid at overdoping , to a large value in the mott insulator with a large energy gap at zero doping .",
    "we shall return to the consequences for arpes later .",
    "another feature of the pseudogap phase is the strong anisotropy in @xmath0-space near the fermi energy .",
    "the single - particle energy gap observed in arpes has its maximum near the antinodal points and decreases as @xmath0 moves along the us towards nodal . at a certain @xmath0-point",
    "there is a crossover to a fermi arc which is inside the us and centered at the nodal point .",

    "more precisely the yrz form predicts a closed nodal pocket with anisotropic quasiparticle weight , rather than a nodal arc .",
    "the arpes data of yang et al @xcite shows evidence supporting such an anisotropic pocket .",
    "ossadnik compared this @xmath0-space anisotropy near the fermi energy to the behavior of multi - leg hubbard ladders near @xmath2-filling . in this case",
    "the band structure is a set of 1d bands labelled by their transverse wavevector .",
    "these 1d bands form pairs with equal effective masses at the fermi level , whose value depends on the rung wavevector @xcite .",
    "these band pairs have different density of states at the fermi level and so make transitions to strong coupling at different critical scales in a rg treatment .",
    "this successive freeze out of the different band pairs as the energy scale is lowered suggests an approximation scheme , where we treat the freeze out of each band pair as independent as we lower the energy scale @xcite . as a result , in a lightly doped system at low temperature , we have a separation into @xmath2-filled band pairs with larger energy gaps , and lightly doped band pairs .",
    "this is very similar in many ways to the variation with @xmath0 along the us in the pseudogap phase in 2d . for a review of multi - ladder hubbard models , see le hur and rice @xcite .      in the cuprates",
    "the 2d band structure energy varies along the us in the presence of nnn hopping , @xmath64 , with a minimum at antinodal and a maximum at nodal according to @xmath65 .",
    "ossadnik showed the simplest way to treat the variation in @xmath0-space along the us is to introduce a partition into independent @xmath0-space patches , each characterized by a ww - wavevector and energy @xcite .",
    "each @xmath0-patch belongs to a star of 8 degenerate @xmath0-points on the us due to the square symmetry of the lattice .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a generalization of the well studied d - mott insulator groundstate of the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder to 2d .",
    "the truncation of the fermi surface in the ladder groundstate by correlations that are strictly short range , even at weak coupling , leads us to look into the possibility of a generalization to 2d .",

    "ossadnik s recent wavepacket formulation of many body theory offers a way to investigate modifications of electronic properties through strictly sro correlations .",
    "the key feature of the d - mott insulator in 1d at weak coupling is the presence of elastic umklapp scattering processes spanning the fermi surface .",
    "generally in higher dimensions the surface spanned by elastic umklapp processes has little overlap with the fermi surface .",
    "so a precursor mott state is only possible at strong coupling .",
    "however the 1d example of the @xmath2-filled 2-leg ladder suggests that there could be special fermi surfaces that are susceptible to truncation by umklapp processes even at moderate coupling .",
    "the relatively small deviations between the 2d fermi surface of the cuo@xmath7 layers in cuprates and the surface that is spanned by umklapp processes in a 2d square lattice near @xmath2-filling led us to investigate this possibility further .",
    "in particular we found a nearby excited band structure state with a special `` fermi '' surface separating occupied and empty states .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the case of cr alloys , where a small distortion of the original fermi surface strongly enhances commensurate nesting thereby enhancing the stability of the commensurate sdw phase . in the cuprates it is the commensurate reduction of the hole density from its value of @xmath105 in the band structure state at overdoping to realize a precursor mott state with hole doping @xmath106 at a value @xmath107 .",

    "their ansatz postulated a form for the self energy similar to that in the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder @xcite .",
    "both focus on insulating energy gaps opening on the us rather than on the overdoped fermi surface .",
    "the earlier pairing ansatz @xcite was inspired by a mean field factorization of the strong coupling @xmath32-@xmath24 hamiltonian and the crossover to the full fermi surface at overdoping appeared when the finite solution to the gap equation vanished in a continuous transition between underdoping and overdoping . in the present approach",
    "the transition is due to an energy crossing between two different groundstates with energy gaps on the us and on the band structure fermi surface . in the simplest description",
    "this leads to a first order transition although this may appear in real materials as continuous due to local fluctuations in the hole density caused by spatial disorder of the acceptors .",
    "one difference between the two proposals is the appearance of near antinodal electron pockets in yrz as the transition is approached from underdoped .",
    "as far as we are aware , the presence of these near antinodal electron pockets have not been seen directly in experiments .",
    "recently a detailed study of the low - field hall effect through the transition has been reported by badoux et al @xcite .",
    "they find an initial sharp drop in the carrier density from the full fermi surface value at overdoping with longer tail on the low hole density side .",
    "this sharp drop could be considered evidence for a discontinuity in carrier density .",
    "note however the crossover agrees well with storey s calculation @xcite using the yrz ansatz . as a result",
    "a firm conclusion between a continuous transition a la yrz and a discontinuity possibly broadened by spatial disorder , is not possible at present .",
    "finally we comment on the nature of lattice fluctuations in the pseudogap state at temperatures @xmath104 .",
    "many authors have looked to explain these as due to the presence of charge density waves associated in some way with the sdw fluctuations and also as competing with superconductivity in this temperature range @xcite .",
    "cdw and phonon fluctuations do not enter in the theoretical model presented here . a recent paper by liu et al .",
    "@xcite gave an alternative explanation for the experiments on this topic , based on the presence of an extended range of superconducting fluctuations above superconducting @xmath63 in the pseudogap state .",
    "using arguments similar to those that are used here to justify the separation between the @xmath72 & @xmath73 movers , they argued for strong phase fluctuations between the pairing amplitudes on the arcs in these directions are accompanied by overdamped leggett modes .",
    "they found that these leggett modes can couple to lattice phonons and lead to unusual giant phonon anomalies in agreement with those observed by le tacon et al @xcite on underdoped ybco with a @xmath108k .",
    "their special feature is a strong increase in the broadening of phonons at specific points in @xmath0-space as @xmath109 which abruptly change character into localized dips in the energy when the sample is cooled to @xmath100 .",
    "note earlier nmr investigations on the double chain cuprate , yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 by suter et al @xcite , found evidence for unusual damping in the charge component of the nmr signals with a similar temperature dependence .",
    "this unusual damping can be explained by low frequency tails of the giant phonon anomalies .",
    "we have proposed a generalization of the well studied d - mott insulator groundstate of the @xmath2-filled 2-leg hubbard ladder to the 2d square lattice .",
    "the truncation of the fermi surface in the ladder is caused by the presence of elastic umklapp scattering processes spanning the fermi surface , which lead to a combination of strictly short range @xmath3-wave singlet pairing and commensurate antiferromagnetic correlations .",
