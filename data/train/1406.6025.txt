    "survey completeness drops precipitously .",
    "because impact energy is proportional to diameter cubed for a given density , relatively small errors in diameter can lead to large errors in predicted impact energy .",
    "today , the vast majority of neos are discovered by visible light surveys such as the catalina sky survey @xcite and panstarrs ( http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/ ) .",

    "neo albedos are known to range widely , from @xmath11 - 50% @xcite .",
    "almost always , nothing beyond absolute magnitude h is known to narrow the range of possible albedos , so the uncertainty in albedo ranges from extremely dark to very bright . in this case , the error in diameter estimated from h alone using an assumed albedo is plus or minus a factor of 3 - 4 when using the relationship @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the effective spherical diameter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in estimated impact energy can be a factor of roughly 20 if diameter is computed using h alone .",

    "these results are very similar to the post - cryogenic phase of the prime mission , which showed that diameters could be determined to within @xmath225% and albedos to within @xmath240% @xcite .",
    "as was observed in these papers , the neatm tends to underestimate the albedos of dark objects and overestimate the albedos of bright objects .",

    "however , the phase angles at which neos and mbas are observed by neowise are generally quite different , meaning that more of the night side is observed for neos , which can also affect the beaming parameter .",

    "this line is obscured by earth s atmosphere , but is detectable from space .",
    "two effects must be mitigated to derive a co@xmath23 production rate .",
    "dust signal must be estimated from the 3.4 @xmath0 m band , but w1 provides only an upper bound on the dust signal . additional visible wavelength brightness measurements from ground - based telescopes taken near the time of the neowise observations serve to better constrain the dust production .",
    "a weaker co line at 4.67 @xmath0 m falls within the w2 bandpass @xcite ; therefore , estimating co@xmath23 production requires an assumption that the signal is not dominated by co. such an assumption is not unreasonable , since per molecule , the co signal is on the order of 11 times weaker .",
    "however , it is not possible to distinguish between the two molecules without further supposition of what the comet s composition is likely to be .",

    "@xmath26 can be determined from the measured comet fluxes and the comet s known distance @xcite .",

    "the same with reddening law from @xcite is shown by the dotted line .",
    "a psd with a -3 power law accounts for the stronger signal at visual wavelengths shown in the plot , since smaller particles do not emit efficiently at longer wavelengths .",

    "for each case of dust behavior scaled to the w1 signal , the w2 signal is still greater than can be accounted for by the model dust component .",
