    "in stark contrast to most searches for new physics , which optimize for a particular model or signature , the general searches presented here are model - independent and include many final state particle combinations in an effort to be highly inclusive .",
    "the cdf global search results will be presented first , followed by the h1 general search results .",
    "the model - independent global search for new high-@xmath7 physics in @xmath8 collisions at the tevatron using cdf has three components  @xcite : vista examines populations and kinematic features of the high-@xmath7 data ; the bump hunter  @xcite searches for resonances in invariant mass combinations ; and sleuth looks for excesses at high sum-@xmath7 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the cdf results use data corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath2 , acquired through inclusive high-@xmath7 electron , muon , photon , and jet triggers .",
    "standard criteria are imposed to identify electrons , muons , taus , photons , jets , @xmath10-jets , and missing transverse energy ( @xmath11 ) , all with thresholds equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "events are further selected to meet offline requirements such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15",
    "approximately @xmath16 million events are partitioned into @xmath17 exclusive final states , and new categories are created as needed .    the strategy is to use monte carlo event generators such as pythia and madevent to represent the standard model ( sm ) , and to pass the resulting events through a geant - based simulation of the cdf detector response . the simulation is then used in a global fit to the cdf data , to extract @xmath18 corrections factors .",
    "the fit is performed simultaneously to all final states and is subjected to external constraints .",
    "the correction factors , which include corrections to leading order theory cross sections , object reconstruction efficiencies , and mis - identification rates , are then used to improve the sm prediction .",
    "the three components ( vista , bump hunter , and sleuth ) of the global comparison between the data and sm prediction are performed , and the procedure is iterated by feeding information back into the simulation and correction factors until there is either a clear case for new physics or all discrepancies have known sources .",
    "the vista comparison of final state populations between data and sm predictions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf_vista_pop ] .",
    "the histogram shows the poisson probability that the sm population in a final state would fluctuate above or below the observed population in data , expressed in units of standard deviations .",
    "the plotted probabilities do not include a trials factor , which accounts for the large number of final states that are examined and reduces the significance of each observed discrepancy .",
    "the greatest observed discrepancy is in the final state @xmath19 where @xmath20 events are expected and @xmath21 events are observed , for a discrepancy of @xmath22 before the trials factor and @xmath23 after including the trials factor .",
    "therefore , no population shows a significant discrepancy .     +    vista also automatically produces and examines @xmath24 kinematic distributions .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf_vista_shapes ] , where the histogram shows the kilmogorov - smirnov probability that the distributions in the data and sm prediction are consistent , expressed in units of standard deviations .",
    "the trials factor due to examining thousands of distributions has not yet been accounted for in the plot .",
    "distributions are considered discrepant if they disagree by more than @xmath25 ( approximately @xmath26 after including the trials factor ) .",
    "the @xmath27 distributions that meet this criteria are examined more closely .",
    "it turns out that @xmath28 of the discrepancies can be explained by a deficiency in modeling soft jet emission in qcd parton showering .",
    "an additional @xmath29 are due to inadequate modeling of the transverse boost of the colliding system and @xmath30 are due to residual crudeness in the correction factor model , mostly from using simplified @xmath7-dependencies in fake rate correction factors . therefore , there are no claims for new physics based on the kinematic distribution comparisons",
    ".      a new resonance might appear as a bump in an invariant mass distribution .",
    "the cdf bump hunter uses the final states from vista to form all invariant mass combinations and perform a comparison between data and sm backgrounds .",
    "a search window of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the expected detector mass resolution , is scanned across each invariant mass distribution .",
    "a candidate bump must have at least five data events and side - bands that are in better agreement than the central search window .",
    "pseudo - experiments are then used to estimate the significance of any qualifying bumps .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath33 scanned distributions , @xmath34 have qualifying bumps .",
    "the visible shift in the histogram is caused by local deficiencies in the sm prediction , but does not invalidate the method since the shift makes it more likely that a bump surpasses the threshold for further study .",
    "the threshold for further investigation is @xmath25 , which corresponds to @xmath35 after including the trials factor for @xmath33 mass distributions .",
    "there is one bump beyond this threshold , in a final state with four jets and low @xmath9 , but it is found to be due to the same soft jet modeling problem mentioned in section  [ sec : vista ] . hence , no new physics is found by the bump hunter in @xmath2 .",
    "sleuth assumes that new physics will appear as an excess , and that the excess will be at high @xmath9 and in one final state .",
    "the @xmath9 is the scalar sum of the @xmath7 of the individual objects , unclustered energy , and @xmath11 . for each final state ,",
    "the @xmath9 distribution is scanned , and the one - sided region with the most significant excess of data is selected .",
    "the significance , @xmath36 , is determined as the fraction of pseudo - experiments that find a region at least as discrepant as the one observed in data .",
    "the final state with the largest discrepancy is @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 before including a trials factor .",
    "it is found that @xmath40 of experiments like cdf would find an excess at least as large as this most discrepant sleuth final state .",
    "there are no claims of new physics using sleuth with @xmath2 .",
    "the global search for new physics at h1 uses data corresponding to luminosities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 from @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "isolated electrons , muons , photons , jets , and neutrinos are included if they have @xmath41 and a polar angle satisfying @xmath42 .",
    "the event selection requires exclusive final states with two or more objects , and events are classified by the number and types of objects .",
    "this procedure examines all combinations and finds that @xmath43 final states are populated .",
    "simulations are used for all contributing sm processes , including photoproduction , deep - inelastic scattering , qed compton scattering , electroweak production , and qcd .",
    "the resulting predictions are used in comparisons to the event yields , @xmath9 , and invariant mass distributions found in data . a statistical algorithm",
    "is then employed to identify the largest deviations and evaluate the associated probabilities .",
    "the event yield comparisons show good agreement in all final states , in both the @xmath4 and @xmath3 data , as shown in fig .",

    "all groups of neighboring @xmath44 bins are tested . a measure , p ,",
    "is determined as the probability for a positive or negative fluctuation of the sm expectation to be at least as large as that observed in data .",
    "the procedure accounts for poisson statistical errors and gaussian systematic uncertainties . for each final state , the region with the smallest p - value",
    "is selected .",
