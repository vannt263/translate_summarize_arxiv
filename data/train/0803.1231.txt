    "the t - quark , as the most massive object in the standard model(sm ) , is that which felt the symmetry breaking the most profoundly . the t - quark physics has become a very active research area since the existence of the t - quark was established in t - quark pair events produced via the strong interaction@xcite , where quark - antiquark annihilation or gluon - gluon fusion leads to top - antitop pairs .",
    "in addition to the top pair production via the strong interaction at hadron colliders , they can also be produced singly in electroweak(ew ) interactions , and there are three single t - quark production modes in the sm : the t - channel tq production , the s - channel @xmath5 production and the associated @xmath9 production .",
    "studying these single t - quark production modes at hadron colliders is important for a number of reasons .",
    "first , a measurement of the production cross section provides the only direct measurement of the total t - quark decay width and the ckm matrix element @xmath10 , without having to assume three quark generations or ckm matrix unitarity .",
    "second , the measurement of the spin polarization of single t - quarks can be used to test the v - a structure of the t - quark ew charged current interaction .",
    "third , the presence of various new sm and non - sm phenomena may be inferred by observing deviations from the predicted rate of the single t - quark signal and by comparing different production modes .",
    "fourth , the single t - quark final states present an irreducible background to several searches for sm or non - sm signals , for example higgs boson searches in the associated production channel .    here , we should emphasize that the single t - quark production is interesting beyond the sm .",
    "the single t - quark production as a window to probe new physics has been systematically studied@xcite and the study shows that three single top production modes can be used to distinguish several new physics models .",
    "new physics can influence the single t - quark production by inducing non - standard weak interactions@xcite , via loop effects@xcite , or by providing new sources of single t - quark events@xcite .",
    "three single t - quark production modes respond quite differently to different realizations of physics beyond the sm@xcite .",
    "in general , the @xmath4 production mode is insensitive to heavy charged bosons .",
    "the reason for this is that the t - channel exchanged results in a space - like momentum , which never can go on - shell , and thus the amplitude for the heavy particle is always suppressed by the mass of the heavy boson , @xmath11 .",
    "however , the fcnc processes can have a drastic effect on the @xmath4 production mode .",
    "because they involve new fc interactions between the t - quark and a light quark(c or u ) , the @xmath4 production mode can be enhanced significantly .",
    "the @xmath5 production mode is very sensitive to an exotic charged boson which couples to t - quark and b - quark .",
    "because the exchanged particle is time - like , there is the possibility(if it is heavier than the t - quark ) that it can be produced on - shell , resulting in a large enhancement of the cross section .",
    "specific theories which predict an enhancement of the cross section of the @xmath5 production are theories with a @xmath12@xcite or charged higgs , both of which can result in the cross section of the @xmath5 production different from the sm by factors of few at either the tevatron or the lhc@xcite . for the @xmath9 mode ,",
    "the cross section is more or less insensitive to new bosons , because the @xmath13 is manifest in the final state .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes are sensitive to different new physics models and hence can be used to distinguish between various exotic models . from this line of thinking",
    ", we see that all three modes are really complimentary views of the t - quark and new physics , and thus measured separately they provide more information than would be obtained by lumping them together into a singular single - top process .    on the experimental aspect , twelve years after the discovery of the t - quark via strong pair production at the tevatron ,",
    "the first evidence of the single t - quark production has been reported by the @xmath6 collaboration@xcite at the tevatron .",
    "the events were selected from a @xmath14 dataset that have an electron or muon and missing transverse energy from the decay of a @xmath13 boson from the top quark decay , and two , three , or four jets with one or two of the jets identified as originating from a b hadron decay .",
    "a binned likelihood fit of the signal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the results from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single t - quark production of @xmath15@xcite .",
    "such value is compatible at the @xmath8 level with the standard model prediction .",
    "the lhc will accelerate proton beams and bring them to collision at a center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of @xmath16 tev and at luminosities between @xmath17(initial low - luminosity phase ) and @xmath18(high luminosity ) .",
    "the single t - quark production can be discovered at the tevatron but the tevatron has little ability to observe three modes individually .",
    "the study of the single t - quark production is a very important part of research programs at future lhc experiments .",
    "such a study allows to investigate the t - quark properties with high enough accuracy and to measure a @xmath3 coupling structure with high precision .",
    "it may shed a light on the underlying theory which probably stands beyond the sm . at the lhc",
    ", it is expected that three different single t - quark production modes can be observed individually .",
    "the three single t - quark processes result in quite distinct final states and topologies , leading to the definition of specific analyses in each case .",
    "the discrimination between them makes use of difference in jet multiplicity , number of b - tagged jets required .",
    "besides , important difference subsists in the level of backgrounds that are faced in the various analyses , leading to the development of tools dedicated to the rejection of specific backgrounds . with more than two millions single t - quark events produced every year during a low luminosity run at the lhc , a precise determination of all contributions to the total single t - quark cross section seems achievable .",
    "these measurements will constitute the first direct measurement of @xmath19 at the few percent level of precision , and also constitute a powerful probe for new physics , via the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the t - quark , or the measurement of additional bosonic contributions to the single t - quark production .    in the transition from the tevatron to the lhc , several aspects of single t - quark physics change .",
    "at the tevatron , the main goal is to observe the ew mode of t - quark production for the first time , and that will be followed by initial measurements .",
    "hence , the emphasis is on extracting the signal from the backgrounds , using optimized methods .",
    "by contrast , by the time that the lhc analyses are starting , the single t - quark production should already have been discovered , and the focus shifts to precision measurement .",
    "thus , the single t - quark production can be used as tools to probe the ew sector and to look for new physics .    among the various new physics models ,",
    "the topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model@xcite is a most promising candidate of dynamical theories .",
    "the tc2 model gives a reasonable explanation of the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) and heavy t - quark mass .",
    "in the tc2 model , the topcolor interaction makes small contribution to the ewsb , and gives rise to the main part of the t - quark mass @xmath20 with a model dependant parameter @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the technicolor interaction plays a main role in the breaking of ew gauge symmetry . to account for the explicit breaking of quark and lepton flavor symmetries , the extended technicolor(etc )",
    "was invented .",
    "the etc interaction gives rise to the masses of the ordinary fermions including a very small portion of the t - quark mass @xmath22 .",
    "this kind of model predicts three cp odd top - pions @xmath23 , @xmath24 and one cp even top - higgs(@xmath25 ) with large yukawa couplings to the third family . as we know , the topcolor interaction is non - universal and such non - universal feature can result in the new tree - level flavor - changing(fc ) couplings when one writes the interaction in the quark mass eigen - basis .",
    "the tc2 model can contribute to the single t - quark production in two different ways .",
    "one is that the top - pions and top - higgs can make the loop contribution to the vertex @xmath3 , and such contribution can influence the production rates of all three single t - quark production modes .",
    "another is that the existence of the fc couplings in the tc2 model can make a significant tree - level contribution to the fc t - quark production processes and some studies have been done@xcite .",
    "the running of the lhc will open an ideal window to probe the effect of the tc2 model via the single t - quark production . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate these two kinds of contributions and study the potential to probe the tc2 model via the single t - quark production at hadron colliders , specially at the lhc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will give a detail calculation of the contributions of the tc2 model to each single t - quark production mode at hadron colliders and discuss the numerical results .",
    "the summary and conclusion are represented in section 4 .",
    "as it is known , the top - pions and top - higgs are predicted by the tc2 model .",
    "the couplings of the top - pions and top - higgs to the three family fermions are non - universal , and the top - pions and top - higgs have large yukawa couplings to the third family .",
    "such feature can result in the significant tree - level fc couplings of the top - pions and top - higgs to the quarks when one writes the interaction in the quark mass eigen - basis .",
    "the couplings of the top - pions and top - higgs to a pair of quarks are proportion to the masses of the quarks and the explicit form can be written as @xcite    @xmath26 .",

    "involves a spacelike @xmath13 boson @xmath58 , as shown in fig.2(a ) , and the virtual @xmath13 boson strikes a b - quark in the proton sea , promoting it to a t - quark . of the single t - quark production modes , the @xmath4 production mode has the largest cross section both at the tevatron and the lhc and such mode has been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "its cross section has been calculated at next - to - leading - order(nlo ) in qcd , and the qcd nlo total cross section is 1.98 pb , 246 pb for the tevatron and the lhc , respectively@xcite .",
    "significant sources of uncertainties affect the theoretical predictions of the cross section and the theoretical uncertainty of the @xmath4 production cross section is the largest one in all single t - quark production modes . at the lhc",
    ", the cross section is so large that it should be possible to collect large samples of single t - quark events via the @xmath4 production which can be used to study the t - quark ew coupling in detail .",
    "the modification of the @xmath3 coupling can influence the cross section of the @xmath4 production in the way shown in fig.3 .",
    "the corresponding production amplitudes can be written as @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61    on the other hand , as we can see from equation ( 1 ) , there exist the tree - level fc couplings @xmath62 in the tc2 model . via @xmath63 collision",
    ", these fc couplings can induce the tree - level contribution to the @xmath64 production via the t - channel and s - channel exchange of @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in fig.4 .",
    "we should note that the cross section of the @xmath64 production via the t - channel in the sm is very small and can be ignored .",
    "the tree - level fc contribution of the tc2 model , specially the resonant effect in the s - channel of fig.4 , can greatly enhance the cross section of the @xmath64 production .",
    "the fc contribution of the tc2 model does not have interference with the sm amplitudes , because the fc contribution only comes from @xmath63 collision .",
    "although such fc contribution arises from both t - channel and s - channel , we combine all the cross sections of @xmath66 productions together due to the difficulty to distinguish these light quarks .",
    "the production amplitudes related to fig.4 can be written as @xmath67    we can see that the time - like momentum may hit the top - pion(top - higgs ) pole in the top - pion(top - higgs ) propagator of s - channel in fig.4 .",
    "so we should take into account the effect of the width of the top - pions(top - higgs ) in the amplitudes @xmath68 .",
    "i.e. , we should take the complex mass term @xmath69 instead of the simple top - pions(top - higgs ) mass term @xmath70 in the top - pions(top - higgs ) propagator .",
    "the term @xmath69 is important in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "the decay widths of @xmath71 and @xmath25 have been calculated in reference@xcite .    with the above production amplitudes",
    ", we can directly obtain the cross sections of subprocess .",
    "the hadronic cross sections at the hadron colliders can be obtained by folding the cross sections of subprocesses with the parton distribution . in the calculation of the cross section , instead of calculating the square of the production amplitudes analytically , we calculate the amplitudes numerically by using the method of reference@xcite .",
    "this greatly simplifies our calculations .    to obtain numerical results of the contribution of the tc2 model to the @xmath4 production ,",
    "we need to specify the relevant parameters in the sm .",
    "these parameters are @xmath72174.2 gev , @xmath734.7 gev , @xmath741.25 gev , @xmath750.002 gev , @xmath760.005 gev , @xmath770.095 gev , @xmath780.118 , @xmath790.23 , and @xmath8080.4 gev@xcite .",
    "expect for these parameters , the production amplitudes are also dependent on some free parameters in the tc2 model : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "here we choose @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 can also be fixed . to see the influences of these parameters on the cross sections , we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 gev as examples , and vary @xmath83 from 200 gev to 400 gev . for the parton distributions , we use cteq6l pdf@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the conjugated @xmath89 production is also considered in the calculation .    to see the effect of the varying @xmath83 , in fig.5",
    ", we plot the relative correction @xmath90 at the lhc as a function of @xmath83 for three values of @xmath91 and two values of @xmath84(200,400 gev ) .",
    "@xmath92 is the total cross section of @xmath4 production at the lhc which is defined as @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being the tree - level sm cross section of the @xmath4 production and @xmath95 being the correction to the cross section induced by the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model and @xmath96 being the cross section of the @xmath64 production induced by the tree - level fc couplings in the tc2 model . from the fig.5 , we can see that the total correction of the tc2 model is positive in most case and it becomes negative when @xmath83 is large .",
    "this is because @xmath95 is negative and @xmath96 is positive .",
    "the resonant effect of s - channel enhances the @xmath96 significantly and it drops sharply when @xmath83 becomes large . as we will discuss in the next section , the light top - pion",
    "is not allowed by the tevatron experiments due to the large contribution of the light top - pion to the @xmath5 production .",
    "for the heavy top - pion , the contribution of the tc2 model to the @xmath4 production at the lhc are not large . comparing two diagrams in fig.5",
    ", we can conclude that large @xmath84 can also depress the correction .",
    "the dependence of @xmath82 on the relative correction is clear , and the relative correction increases with @xmath82 increasing .    to provide more information ,",
    "we show each contribution of the tc2 model to the @xmath4 production at the lhc in table 1 .",
    "we can see that the main correction of the tc2 model to the @xmath4 production comes from the tree - level fc coupling and such correction is positive .",
    "the correction induced by the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model is negative and the maximal value of the relative correction is only about @xmath97 .",
    "the ability to detect the correction of the tc2 model via the single t - quark production at the lhc is determined by the precision to measure the @xmath4 process .",
    "the precision on the cross section is related to the statistical sensitivity , systematic uncertainties , theoretical background uncertainties and the luminosity uncertainties .",
    "so the final state signature and the backgrounds should be analyzed in detail .",
    "the final state signature of the @xmath4 production is characterized by a high energy isolated lepton and missing transverse energy from the decay of the w from the t - quark into @xmath98 , and two or three jets .",
    "one of the jets originates from a b - quark from the t - quark decay and is usually central(low pseudorapidities ) and energetic .",
    "there usually are , apart from the b jet from t - quark decay , a moderately energetic light flavor jet and a high pseudorapidity low energy b - quark jet from gluon splitting .",
    "this very forward or backward b jet is a unique feature of this signal , but it is rarely reconstructed and even more difficult to tag . among the two or three jets ,",
    "at least one jet must be b tagged in the central pseudo - rapidity region .",
    "the other b jet in the final state is usually emitted towards the very forward region , outside the tracker acceptance and thus out of reach of the b - tagging algorithm in most case .",
    "the main processes that can mimic the final state topology of @xmath4 production are : ( i)w+jets events , where the w boson decays semileptonically and two or more associated jets are produced ; ( ii)@xmath99 events , where one or both t - quarks decay leptonically ; and ( iii)qcd or multi - jet events .",
    "contrary to the situation at the tevatron , the main background comes from the t - quark pair production at the lhc , well above the w+jets and wqq events .",
    "the t - quark pair production has a cross section larger than the single t - quark production .",
    "but the average energy in the event is larger , due to the presence of two t - quarks , and events tend to be more spherical and have more jet multiplicity than single t - quark events .",
    "two t - quarks produce two w bosons and two b - quark jets , the latter with very similar kinematics to the signal and therefore likely to be b tagged as well .",
    "the same final state signature as in the single t - quark processes is obtained if only one of the w bosons decays leptonically and the other hadronically , or if both do , but only one lepton is reconstructed .",
    "this background can be properly simulated using alpgen or pythia .",
    "the w+jets background is by far the most problematic to get rid of .",
    "it consists of a leptonically decaying w boson and at least two associated quarks or gluons .",
    "w+jets events contain less energy in the event than the single t - quark signals since they do not contain a heavy object like the t - quark .",
    "but the cross section is very large in comparison to the single t - quark production , and the flavor composition of the associated jets is sufficiently complex , to make this background hard to model and even harder to get rid of as one applies b tagging techniques , since they tend to shift distributions to be more signal - like and wash away any low energy feature .",
    "this background has been estimated using simulated events , by alpgen for example , and is usually scaled to data to get the overall normalization right .",
    "the qcd background typically enters as misreconstructed events , where a jet is wrongly identified as an electron , or a muon from a heavy flavor jet appears isolated in the detector .",
    "multi - jet events may also contain heavy flavor jets or just light jets that are misidentified by the b tagging algorithma .",
    "the transverse energy of qcd events is much less than signal events , and the mass of the system of the b - tagged jet , the lepton and the neutrino does not peak at @xmath39 , but the cross section is overwhelmingly large .",
    "this background is usually obtained directly from data , and after some initial basic criteria can be reduced in size to the same level as the signal .    with a large cross section",
    ", the @xmath4 production will be the first single t - quark production accessible with the early data at the lhc .",
    "the cross section measurement of such mode benefits from a significantly higher statistics compared to the other single t - quark production modes .",
    "the final topology is also significantly different from that of the other modes , and leads to a specific selection .",
    "the precision on the cross section is related to the statistical sensitivity , systematic uncertainties , theoretical background uncertainties and the luminosity uncertainties . with a simple selection",
    ", the precision is expected to be@xcite @xmath100 at atlas for @xmath101 , and @xmath102 at cms for @xmath103@xcite .",
    "we can see that the statistical sensitivity is very small with the large cross section at the lhc and the main uncertainties come from systematic uncertainties . based on our calculation",
    ", we can conclude that the lhc should have the ability to detect the contribution induced by the fc coupling in the tc2 model via the @xmath4 production , but higher sensitivity is needed if one wants to obtain the information about the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model .",
    "another process in the sm that produces a single t - quark is the s - channel @xmath5 production via the time - like w boson , as shown in fig.2(b)@xcite .",
    "the cross section of such production in the sm is much less than that of the @xmath4 production because it scales like @xmath104 rather than @xmath105 .",
    "however , the @xmath5 process has the advantage of little theoretical uncertainty@xcite .",
    "this is because the quark and anti - quark distribution functions are relative well known , so the uncertainty from the parton distribution functions is small .",
    "furthermore , the parton luminosity can be constrained by measuring the drell - yan process @xmath106 , which has the identical initial state .",
    "the nlo cross section of the @xmath5 production in the sm is 0.88 pb , 10.6 pb for the tevatron and the lhc , respectively@xcite .",
    "the total cross section is even known to next - to - next - to - leading order@xcite .    due to the existence of the @xmath3 coupling",
    ", the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model also affects the @xmath5 production as shown in fig.6(6 ) .    including the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model",
    ", we can write the production amplitude of the @xmath5 process as @xmath107{2}}g(p_{3}+p_{4},m_{w})\\overline{u}_{t}(p_{4 } )   \\gamma^{\\mu}(p_4,-p_3)v_{\\overline{b}}(p_{3})\\overline{v}_{\\overline{q}'}(p_{2})\\gamma_{\\mu}p_{l}u_{q}(p_{1 } ) .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , due to the existence of the tree - level fc coupling @xmath108 , @xmath109 can contribute to the @xmath5 production through the s - channel virtual exchange of a @xmath109 as shown in fig.6(7 ) .",
    "as in the @xmath4 production , the s - channel contribution of @xmath109 to the @xmath5 production can also allow large resonant contribution .",
    "the distribution of the invariant mass of the @xmath5 system could show the resonant effect around the mass of @xmath109 , which serves to identify this type of particles .",
    "however , if the mass of @xmath109 is very large and its width is broad , the resonant shape can be washed out .    the production amplitude of the @xmath5 process induced by the fc coupling @xmath108 is @xmath110 here we also take into account the effect of the width of the charged top - pions in the amplitude @xmath111 due to the existence of the resonant effect .",
    "the decay width of the charged top - pions has been given in reference@xcite    the amplitude @xmath111 does not have a significant interference with the sm amplitudes because the sm contribution is mostly from light quarks(@xmath112 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "so , in the tc2 model , the total cross section of the @xmath5 production can been written as    @xmath114    here @xmath115 is the sm tree - level cross section of @xmath5 production , @xmath116 is the correction induced by the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model , and @xmath117 is the cross section of the @xmath5 production induced by the tree - level fc coupling in the tc2 model .    in fig.7 , we plot the total relative correction at the lhc , @xmath118 , as a function of @xmath83 , here the @xmath89 production is also considered as in the @xmath4 production .",
    "the relative correction drops sharply with @xmath83 .",
    "it is shown that even with large @xmath83 , the contribution of the tc2 model can also enhance the sm cross section significantly . to represent each contribution of the tc2 model",
    ", we show @xmath119 in table.2 .",
    "similar to the @xmath4 production , the correction induced by the @xmath3 coupling is negative and below @xmath120 in the parameter space considered .",
    "the total contribution is dominated by the contribution induced by the tree - level fc coupling @xmath121 .    like the @xmath4 production",
    ", there is the final state signature @xmath98 and a b - quark jet in the @xmath5 production .",
    "the other energetic jet is also from a b - quark , and shares similar kinematics with the b - quark from the t - quark decay .",
    "thus b - quark identification , or b tagging , in the @xmath5 production is equally likely between the b - quark from the t - quark decay and the b - quark from the original interaction . from a phenomenological standpoint ,",
    "the most important distinction of the final states between @xmath5 and @xmath4 productions is the presence of a second high-@xmath122 b - jet in the @xmath5 process . in the @xmath4 production",
    ", the second b - jet tends to be at low @xmath122 and is often not seen .",
    "therefore , the requirement of two b - jets with high @xmath122 will eliminate most of the background coming from the @xmath4 production . on the other hand , the requirement of two b - tagged jets is also crucial to reduce the contamination of w+jets events that have a cross section several orders of magnitude that of the signal . furthermore , it is also necessary , as in other single t - quark production modes , to design cuts to reduce the w+jets and @xmath99 backgrounds . in order to reduce contamination by w+jets events ,",
    "the reconstructed t - quark mass in each event must fall within a window about the known t - quark mass , and the events must have a total transverse jet momentum above 175 gev .",
    "only events containing exactly two jets(both tagged as b s ) are kept in order to reduce the @xmath99 background .",
    "the study indicates that , despite the large anticipated background rate , it should be possible to perform a good statistical measurement of the cross section for the @xmath5 production .",
    "the resulting @xmath123 ratio is about @xmath124 in the @xmath125 final state .",
    "it is obvious that the combination of both final states is required to improve the sensitivity .",
    "the precision on the cross section has been assessed at the lhc for an integrated luminosity of @xmath126 at different stages of the analysis .",
    "after the simple preselection stage , results show a good statistical sensitivity but higher level of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the precision at atlas for @xmath101 is shown as@xcite @xmath127 using both the @xmath128(the total transverse energy ) and reconstructed t - quark mass results in a significantly reduced level of systematics at the price of loss in statistical sensitivity @xmath129 at cms for @xmath103 , the precision is @xcite @xmath130 in all case , systematic errors are expected to dominate the cross section determination .",
    "as we have discussed above , the measurement of the @xmath5 production may appear as the most delicate of the main three single t - quark processes because of its relative low cross section compared to the others at the lhc .",
    "it is however one of the most interesting because the final state events of the @xmath5 production is directly sensitive to contributions from extra particles predicted in new physics models .",
    "our results shows that the correction to the @xmath5 production induced by the @xmath3 coupling is still small as in the @xmath4 production which is embedded in the large contribution coming from the tree - level fc coupling in the tc2 model .",
    "certainly , the lhc has the ability to detect such fc effect . on the other hand",
    ", the lhc experiments about the @xmath5 production should provide a severe limit on the fc coupling @xmath121 if the cross section of the @xmath5 production is measured precisely at the lhc .",
    "therefore @xmath5 production provides a unique chance to study the properties of the fc coupling @xmath121 at the lhc .",
    "although the tevatron can not measure three single t - quark production modes separately , the measured cross section @xmath7 has been given by the tevatron experiments which can also provide rude information about @xmath5 production .",
    "the experimental value of the cross section of @xmath5 production is almost consistent with the sm value .",
    "so it is necessary to calculate the contribution of the tc2 model to the @xmath5 production at the tevatron due to the large contribution of the tc2 model to the @xmath5 production .",
    "we plot the total relative correction of the tc2 model to the @xmath5 production at the tevatron in fig.8 and represent each contribution in table 3 .",
    "clearly there should exists large down - limit on the top - pion mass if the predicted cross section in the tc2 model is consistent with the tevatron experiments .      a single t - quark",
    "may also be produced via the weak interaction in association with a real w boson @xmath131 , as shown in fig.2(c)@xcite . like the @xmath4 production ,",
    "one of the initial partons is a b - quark .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath4 production , this associated production scales like 1/s .",
    "this , combined with the higher values of x needed to produce both a t - quark and a w boson , leads to a cross section which is significantly less than that of the @xmath4 process , despite the fact that it is order @xmath132 rather than @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath9 process is also known at nlo , and the total nlo cross section is 0.14 pb at the tevatron which is negligible , while it is 68 pb at the lhc@xcite .    if the t - quark has indeed a special role in the generation of masses , it is crucial that its interactions should be carefully studied in order to learn what properties the underlying theory at high energies must possess .",
    "the deviations of @xmath3 coupling from the sm predictions may represent the best clues on the nature of the ewsb .",
    "as we know , each single t - quark production mode is sensitive to different types of new physics , with the @xmath9 mode distinct in that it is sensitive only to physics which directly modifies the @xmath3 coupling from its sm structure .",
    "this distinction is a result of the fact that in this mode both the t - quark and the w are directly observable , whereas in the other two modes the w bosons are virtual , and thus those processes may receive contributions from exotic types of charged bosons or fcnc interactions . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath9 mode can also provide complimentary information about the @xmath3 coupling by probing it in a region of momentum different from other single t - quark production modes .",
    "similar to the @xmath4 production , the cross section for this associated production increases by more than two orders of magnitude from the tevatron to the lhc , it is sufficiently large at the lhc to not only observe this mode of single t - quark production but also to study the @xmath3 coupling in detail .",
    "unlike the other two single t - quark production modes , there only exists the contribution from @xmath3 coupling for the @xmath9 production in the tc2 model , shown as fig.9 .",
    "the production amplitudes including such contribution are @xmath134 the total cross section of the @xmath9 production is defined as @xmath135 . here",
    "we only consider the tree - level sm cross section @xmath136 , and @xmath137 represents the correction from the @xmath3 coupling . in the calculation",
    ", we take the same parameter values as in the other two single t - quark production modes , and also consider the @xmath89 production . here",
    "we focus on studying the @xmath9 production mode at the lhc .",
    "the numerical results of relative correction at the lhc , @xmath138 , are shown in fig.10 .",
    "because the correction to the @xmath9 production only comes from the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model the relative correction to the @xmath9 production is small and negative .    as for the other two single t - quark production modes , we select @xmath9 events by requiring a single high @xmath139 lepton and a high missing transverse energy .",
    "such a selection criterion implies that one w boson decays leptonically and that the second w boson must decay into two jets .",
    "therefore , the selected events have exactly three jets with one of them tagged as a b - jet .",
    "this allows to reject part of @xmath99 background .",
    "in addition , by requiring a 2-jet invariant mass within a window around the w mass , it is possible to eliminate most events that do not contain a second w , i.e. all backgrounds other than @xmath99 .    the strategy for measuring",
    "the cross section of the @xmath9 production is similar to that for the @xmath4 production , as they share the same backgrounds .",
    "however , the nature of the associated production makes it relatively easy to separate the signal from @xmath140jets background and difficult to separate from @xmath99 background .",
    "therefore , the dominant background arises from @xmath99 production . from the point of view of signal identification ,",
    "the region with small @xmath9 invariant mass , near the @xmath99 threshold , has possibly a chance to be optimal .",
    "the @xmath9 process analysis benefits from the relative high cross section .",
    "however , due to high similarities with top pair events , the selection is hampered by a high level of background contamination .",
    "this characteristics makes the @xmath9 cross section very difficult to measure with the early data at the lhc .",
    "two studies designed to separate signal from background have been performed using two different final states .",
    "the first is a study which attempts to isolate @xmath9 signal events in which one w decays to jets and the other decays to leptons@xcite .",
    "the second study attempts to isolate signal events in which both w s decay leptonically@xcite . based on the sm prediction ,",
    "the @xmath123 ratio is well below @xmath8 . because the main background comes from the top pair production ,",
    "the prior precise determination of the top pair production cross section is needed . combining both electron and muon channels as well as all two and three jet final states leads to a statistical precision slightly below @xmath141 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath142 . as we have discussed above ,",
    "the relative correction of the tc2 model to the @xmath9 production is only a few percent even in the optimal parameter space .",
    "based on the precision on the cross section of the @xmath9 production ,",
    "it is difficult to observe such correction at the lhc . therefore , @xmath9 production is not ideal process to test the tc2 model .",
    "the single t - quark production plays an important role in probing the properties of the @xmath3 coupling and new physics model . with the running of the lhc , it is possible to measure each single t - quark production mode separately and the cross section can be measured precisely .",
    "so the lhc opens an ideal window to probe the new physics via the single t - quark production . in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the contribution of the tc2 model to each single t - quark production mode at the lhc and also study the @xmath5 at the tevatron . due to the existence of the top - pions and top - higgs",
    ", the tc2 model can contribute to the single t - quark production in two different ways .",
    "one is that the tc2 model can make the loop - level contribution to the cross sections which is induced by the modification of the @xmath3 coupling in the tc2 model .",
    "such contribution exists in all three single t - quark production modes , but it is very small . even at the lhc , it is difficult to observe this kind of loop - level contribution .",
    "another kind of contribution comes from the tree - level fc couplings in the tc2 model .",
    "such contribution only exists in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 production modes and the resonant effect can greatly enhance the cross sections .",
    "the recent tevatron experiments has given a cross section for single t - quark production of @xmath7 which is consistent with the sm value .",
    "so there should exists down - limit on the top - pion mass . with the precise measurement of the cross section for each single t - quark production mode at the lhc",
    ", detailed information about the parameters and the fc couplings in the tc2 model can be obtained .",
