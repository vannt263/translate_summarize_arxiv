''",

    ", many interesting coding problems fit within this framework .",
    "these problems , which we discuss below , correspond to subsets of this two - dimensional extended quadrant ( @xmath73 \\times [ -1,\\posinf]$ ] ) . on the set of points for which @xmath47 is @xmath74 , for example , the minimization reduces to exponential huffman coding with parameter @xmath75 . for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 $ ] )",
    "we have huffman coding .",
    "a particular type of huffman coding occurs for @xmath78 , @xmath79 . in such a case , we note that @xmath80 where the second term on the right - hand side represents variance .",

    "we define @xmath62th exponential redundancy as dabr for @xmath81 .",
    "note that the maximal redundancy problem is equivalent to minimizing @xmath62th exponential redundancy as @xmath82 .",
    "thus , considering @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath62th exponential redundancy is a subproblem with a parameter that varies solution values between minimizing average redundancy ( huffman coding ) and minimizing maximal redundancy ; such a range of problems and solutions was sought in @xcite .",
    "this was previously derived axiomatically without regard to such a range and without solution  @xcite .",
    "the version of the minimal dabr coding solution applying to the maximal redundancy subproblem was found shortly thereafter  @xcite , although it was not generalized to @xmath84 or to @xmath85 .",
    "drmota and szpankowski presented a simple method for finding a code with minimum maximal redundancy  @xcite .",
    "however , this solution is deficient in the following senses : first , time complexity is @xmath86 .",
    "second , the kraft inequality is not necessarily satisfied with equality , meaning that the optimal code found in this manner is often , in some sense , wasteful .",
    "third , the code does not necessarily optimize @xmath62th exponential redundancy for any @xmath87 .",
    "the method is also not generalized to maximal @xmath47-redundancy ( @xmath88 ) .    in order to overcome the first two deficiencies , we propose a reduction to a previously - known algorithm with linear complexity previously discussed by parker  @xcite .",
    "this problem was termed the _ tree - height measure _ problem , though it was not previously considered in the context of the maximal redundancy or dabr problems .",
    "the tree - height measure problem minimizes the maximum value of @xmath89 given @xmath90 and weight vector @xmath91 . instead of using @xmath92 on the merge step of huffman coding ,",
    "the huffman - like tree - height measure algorithm uses @xmath93 . in order to use the tree - height measure algorithm , assign weights according to @xmath94 which is always nonnegative , and let @xmath95 .",
    "then this modified huffman algorithm minimizes @xmath96 thus this linear - time algorithm returns a length vector minimizing maximum @xmath47-redundancy and satisfying the kraft inequality with equality .    because ties can occur in selecting weights to combine ,",
    "the exponential huffman algorithm might yield one of many possible optimal codes , including codes not optimal for the limit of @xmath62th exponential redundancy ( as @xmath97 ) .",
    "for example , consider @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath62th exponential redundancy , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are both optimal for @xmath97 .",
    "these not only minimize maximal redundancy , but , among codes that optimize this , these codes also have the lowest probability of achieving this maximal redundancy , as this is related to the second term of the expansion of @xmath101 for @xmath97 : @xmath102 \\\\ & & { + } \\ : \\order\\left(\\frac{1}{d 2^d}\\right ) \\qquad \\hbox{as}\\ d\\to \\posinf \\end{array } \\label{dinfb}\\ ] ] each term in the expansion has a different asymptotic complexity . as with minimum variance ( bottom - merge ) huffman coding ( [ variance ] ) , each additional term further restricts the set of feasible codes to those that minimize the current term given the optimization of previous terms . in the above example , all terms are minimized by both the aforementioned sets of lengths . in contrast ,",
    "@xmath103 , although also minimizing maximal redundancy , results in a code where codewords have a higher probability of achieving maximal redundancy .",
    "this solution , which is in some sense inferior , can nevertheless be achieved by the tree - height measure algorithm , specifically the bottom - merge version .",
    "it is possible to find a @xmath104 such that , for every @xmath105 , @xmath62th exponential huffman coding minimizes maximal redundancy .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the minimum strictly positive value of @xmath107 , and let @xmath108 denote the fractional part of @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "assign @xmath111 .",
    "it is possible to show that a sufficiently large @xmath112 is given by @xmath113@xcite .",
    "however , finding @xmath112 requires sorting , so an algorithm derived from this @xmath112 would not be a linear - time algorithm .    fortunately , it is possible to arrive at a linear - time algebraic huffman algorithm , that is , one that keeps @xmath112 as a variable .",
    "algebraic huffman algorithms were introduced by knuth  @xcite .",
    "the one proposed here uses a huffman algorithm which keeps track of both the first- and second - order terms ; ties between these pairs of terms can occur only when all terms are tied , this due to the manner in which the huffman procedure works . before explaining why this is the case , we present the algorithm .",
    "the aforementioned first- and second - order terms are @xmath114^{(d^{-1})}\\ ] ] and @xmath115^{-1 } \\cdot { [ w_i']^{d}},\\ ] ] respectively , where leaf nodes have @xmath116 as in @xmath62-average @xmath47-redundancy .",
    "one can think of @xmath117 as representing an invertible function of maximal @xmath47-redundancy , @xmath118^{-1 } \\cdot 2^{\\max_i r_b(i)},\\ ] ] where , at any given point of the algorithm , @xmath119 uses the depth of item @xmath1 in its interim code tree as the value @xmath120 .",
    "note that only @xmath121 is variable ; the denominator term of @xmath117 is a result of not normalizing the weights at the start of the algorithm . in a similar manner , @xmath122 represents the probability of maximal @xmath47-redundancy @xmath123 $ ] .    to implement this algorithm",
    ", we let @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the initial case . in comparing items @xmath126 and @xmath127 ,",
    "we consider them as lexicographically ordered pairs  e.g. , @xmath128  so that @xmath129 if and only if either @xmath130 or if @xmath131 and @xmath132 , as in @xcite . in combining items @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( where @xmath129 as described ) , the new item will have @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath134 , then @xmath135 . otherwise , @xmath136",
    ". that is , @xmath137 the reasons for this are easily seen if we view @xmath138 as the representation of maximal redundancy and probability this maximal redundancy is achieved .",
    "take the maximum and add @xmath22 for the additional bit of the codeword ( multiplying @xmath139 by 2 ) . then , if the redundancies are identical , add their probabilities ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "otherwise , take the probability of the maximal redundancy .",
    "this combining method is a huffman algebra , satisfying the properties introduced in @xcite .",
    "the huffman combining criterion is shown by example in figure  [ huffmm ] .",
    "the remaining weight pair after coding , @xmath141 , indicates a maximal redundancy of @xmath142 and a probability of @xmath143 that this redundancy is achieved .",
    "we now show that ties in the @xmath144 pairs imply ties in all terms of the expansion presented in ( [ dinfb ] ) , or , equivalently , for @xmath62th exponential redundancy for all @xmath145 where @xmath112 is some ( unspecified ) constant .",
    "if there is a tie in the above @xmath144 pairs , there is a tie in all terms of the corresponding @xmath62 expansion .    consider two tied pairs .",
    "note that , in each , @xmath146 because this holds with equality in leaf nodes and the inequality is preserved in the merge step , since @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "if inequality ( [ www ] ) holds without equality for the tied pairs , neither node on the corresponding code tree can be a leaf node , and , due to ordering for the combination step , their four children must be identically weighed .",
    "however , this fact can be invoked inductively for either pair of children , also tied , and thus such a tree could not be finite .",
    "therefore , tied pairs arise only in cases for which the inequality holds with equality .",
    "thus , they must be leaf nodes or nodes with two identically - weighted children .",
    "inductively , this means the subtrees must be composed of leaf nodes that are _ _ relatively dyadic , that is , are dyadic when multiplied by a nontrivial common constant .",
    "thus they are equal in all terms , which is what we set out to show .    one can use bottom - merge or top - merge coding so that the algorithm is deterministic",
    ". if one uses top - merge coding  that is , favoring combined items over single items with identical weight  @xcite  one actually need not keep track of the second term ; the top - merge algorithm behaves identically without considering this term .",
    "this variant , illustrated in figure  [ hufftm ] , is actually a special case of the tree - height measure problem mentioned above .",
    "however , if we wish to assure that the solution has minimum variance , the algebraic method is needed .",
    "one can easily see that if we relax the integer constraint on length for minimizing @xmath62-average @xmath47-redundancy , the real - valued solution is not @xmath149 , but some different @xmath150 . by substituting the solution in ( [ idealsol1 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "note that when the values of @xmath47 and @xmath62 are exchanged , the ideal solution remains the same .",
    "this problem thus has a high degree of symmetry .",
    "however , because the problem itself is not symmetric , the symmetry of integer solutions is not perfect , as we can see in figure  [ bdfig2 ] .    using this and the shannon code  @xcite analogue @xmath153 , we can find bounds for the optimal dabr when @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 : @xmath157 where we recall @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the subscript of rnyi entropy in ( [ renyi ] ) . as with exponential huffman coding , equality holds iff the ideal solution @xmath150 has all integer lengths . for @xmath78 and @xmath76 ,",
    "this results in the well - known shannon bounds . for @xmath81",
    ", it reduces to a normalized version of an inequality in @xcite . with a different normalization",
    ", this inequality relates to rnyi s gain of information of order @xmath160 , a generalization of relative entropy  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given the relationship between relative entropy and huffman coding noted by longo and galasso  @xcite .    due to the reduction to exponential huffman coding",
    ", more sophisticated redundancy results may be applied if desired .",
    "the bounds given by blumer and mceliece@xcite apply to the exponential case but appear as solutions to related problems rather than in closed form .",
    "taneja@xcite gave closed - form bounds using an alternative definition of redundancy .",
    "a two - dimensional framework is demonstrated to encompass examples considered by parker  @xcite  classical huffman coding  @xcite , the exponential variant proposed by campbell  @xcite , and the @xmath62th exponential redundancy problem proposed by nath  @xcite .",
    "these examples , along with all problems within the framework , are solvable by huffman - like algorithms .",
    "the maximal redundancy problem proposed by drmota and szpankowski  @xcite is shown to be optimized by its equivalence to another example considered by parker ; the top - merge version of the algorithm in particular additionally optimizes @xmath62th exponential redundancy for large @xmath62 .",
    "a better solution  one minimizing codeword length variance among such optimal codes  is suggested by and is developed from the two - dimensional framework introduced here .",
    "all algorithms discussed are huffman - like and thus linear - time given sorted input , unlike the original algorithm proposed for maximal redundancy .",
    "it is unclear whether all nontrivial problems within parker s more general framework are covered by this seemingly more specific framework and trivial extensions thereof .",
    "such analysis , building upon parker s work , could be a basis for further research . extending this algorithm to alphabetic codes ( alphabetic search trees )",
    "could also be explored . for nonnegative exponents ( @xmath161 ) , this framework is a trivial extension of @xcite , but negative exponents might provide more of a challenge .",
