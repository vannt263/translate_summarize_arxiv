    "the current observations of ultra - high energy cosmic rays  @xcite do not allow firm conclusions on the existence of the cut - off of the cosmic ray spectrum between 10@xmath1 and 10@xmath2 ev , as proposed by greisen and zatsepin&kuzmin  @xcite ( gzk ) .",
    "the cut - off should exist if the the source distribution of uhecr were isotropic and homogeneous because of photoproduction interactions on the microwave background .",
    "there also should be  @xcite a small pile - up just before the cut - off and a secondary small dip in the spectrum due to electromagnetic pair production on the same target . while some of the highest statistics experiments  @xcite see similar features in their data , others  @xcite observe a spectrum that extends well beyond 10@xmath2 ev .",
    "the possible absence of the gzk cut - off in the observed uhecr suggests that local sources contribute a significant fraction of the observed uhecr .",
    "the spectrum that could be derived by the world uhecr statistics can indeed  @xcite be fit fairly well with a combination of homogeneous and local source distributions .",
    "the problem with this solution is that the cosmic rays above 4.10@xmath1 ev , which should not scatter much in weak random magnetic fields , do not display strong large scale anisotropy .",
    "the observed small scale clusters  @xcite do not point at any known nearby astrophysical system , or at regions of increased matter density .",
    "the isotropy of uhecr can in principle be explained by scattering in large scale magnetic fields .",
    "for example , one suggestion is  @xcite that there is a sizable galactic halo , similar to the heliospheric one , that isotropizes uhecr protons . understanding the influence of the large - scale magnetic fields on the cosmic ray propagation is vital for obtaining reliable information on the sources .",
    "the cosmic ray injection power of the sources , needed to maintain the observed highest energy cosmic ray flux , depends directly on the large - scale magnetic fields in the vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "magnetic fields can not only change the locally observed intensity but also the energy spectrum of uhecr  @xcite . depending on the typical field strength , protons with energies greater than @xmath3 ev",
    "are hardly deflected during propagation whereas , for example , particles of @xmath4 ev may have a diffusive propagation pattern . in such models",
    "all cosmic rays could be local , with observed spectra strongly influenced by field geometry and source distributions .",
    "several earlier papers  @xcite have studied the acceleration and propagation of uhecr protons in intense magnetic structures .",
    "most of these papers attempt to create quasi - realistic scenarios , making the straight - forward understanding of the involved physical processes difficult .",
    "we take the opposite approach and introduce relatively simple , yet qualitatively different , magnetic field geometries and deal with a single cosmic ray source .",
    "this makes it possible to directly follow and understand the consequences of regular large scale magnetic fields .",
    "we first assume that both the nearby uhecr source and the galaxy are inside a wall with high concentration of matter ( supergalactic plane ( sgp ) ) , which also creates a large scale magnetic field structure . restricting our considerations to a nearby source at 20 or 40 mpc , we study the influence of different magnetic field configurations on the particle densities , arrival directions and energy spectra .",
    "another scenario that we investigate is that of a source well outside the local magnetic field environment .",
    "in such a case the effects on the ` detected ' uhecr are different , but can also be understood on the basis of the same processes that affect the local source scenario .    before proceeding , we emphasize the following points to be kept in mind as our results are presented .",
    "the effects of our nominal field models qualitatively divide into two energy regions which , coincidentally or not , correspond to uhecr with energies above and below the gzk cutoff ( @xmath5 ev ) . in the high energy regime",
    "the primary effect is to modestly change the direction of uhecr .",
    "the relevant experimental question is , `` can the isotropy of super - gzk uhecr be affected ? '' at lower energies particle propagation becomes diffusive , so that the relative geometry of source and observer in the regular magnetic field can strongly influence the uhecr spectrum and intensity . here",
    ", the relevant question becomes , how do magnetic fields affect ones ability to infer source properties by measurements of the spectra ?",
    "third , since the transition energy is near the gzk cuto - off , the apparent strength of the gzk spectral feature may be affected by the presence of large scale non - random magnetic fields .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we discuss the supergalactic plane and field geometry in section 2 , which also gives some details of the calculation .",
    "the results on the particle densities within the 20 mpc sphere as a function of the magnetic field geometry are presented in section 3 .",
    "the energy spectra and directions of particles leaving the 20 mpc sphere at different angles from the magnetic field direction are given in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the boundary conditions of the simulation - the distance from the source to the observer , the possible existence of an external source and the time dependence of the uhe proton spectra in the case of an impulse injection of uhecr .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in section 6 .",
    "we consider a single source in the supergalactic plane at a distance of 20 mpc , compatible with the distance to the local supercluster .",

    "we can conclude that it is very much influenced by drifts and bending as the protons approach the cap from a variety of angles in the ` _ xy _ ' plane .",
    "the protons exiting through the _ xz _ cap consist obviously of two separate populations : the higher energy protons with relatively small scattering angles and the widely distributed lower energy particles that do not retain the memory of their source direction .",

    "having said this , the conclusions depend on a fairly small set of models , with particular parameter values and choice of boundary conditions .",
    "it is interesting to know if the conclusions are robust with regard to these choices .",
    "other than geometry , the relevant parameters are the 3 mpc thickness of the supergalactic plane , the strengths of the regular and random fields , and the rate of energy loss for uhe particles .",
    "the latter is fixed by our knowledge of particle physics and cosmology , but the others are variable",
    ". changing parameters will alter the quantitative behavior of the simulations , but should not affect the qualitative conclusions .",
    "for example , we discern a characteristic break in behavior at energies of approximately @xmath88  ev , corresponding approximately to the energy at which the gyroradius is equal to the thickness of the supergalactic plane .",
    "lowering @xmath16 , or decreasing the thickness of the supergalactic plane , should lower the energy above which particles can effectively escape without significant bending of their trajectories .",
    "the characteristic break would remain , but its location would change .    similarly , the relative strength of the regular and random fields determines the importance of various transport mechanisms for low and medium energy particles . as long as the regular field strength exceeds the random component , low energy particles will tend to follow the regular field within the supergalactic plane . at the edges of the plane , transport of low and intermediate energy protons",
    "is dominated by @xmath89 drift in the @xmath90 direction if @xmath91 and oppositely for @xmath92 .",
    "apart from such observations , we will not undertake a study of how varying parameters of our model may affect our conclusions , but instead focus on the effect of differing boundary conditions .",
    "our simulation assumes a constant luminosity point source at the center and propagation to the edge of a sphere , after which the particles are assumed to escape .",
    "accordingly , we examine three variations , one designed to study the boundary condition as particles exit the sphere , one which studies a different source geometry and one which studies a different source history .      our assumption that particles escape seems rather simplistic .",
    "surely , a realistic model must allow for backscattering , and so an observer on the surface of the sphere would see an additional flux of particles we have not accounted for .",
    "diffusive backflow will tend to increase the density of particles in the simulation and increase their average lifetime . on the other hand , particles that leave the simulation due to drift",
    "are not expected to return .",

    "finally the bottom right - hand panel gives the energy spectrum of the protons that leave the 40 mpc sphere through its _ front _ cap .",
    "although the spectrum has qualitatively the same features as for the 20 mpc sphere , there are some differences .",
    "the first one is that the particle flux above 10@xmath2 ev is here significantly lower .",
    "this is obviously a result of the longer propagation distance and correspondingly increased energy loss",
    ". there is also some redistribution in the energy range around 10@xmath1 ev .",
    "some of the same particles that have populated the energy range above 10@xmath2 ev have moved to this range , while some of the lower energy particles are lost from the simulation because of their large pathlength . as a result ,",
    "the energy spectrum is almost flat ( @xmath95 ) in the range of 10@xmath96 - 10@xmath97    our conclusion derived from the results shown in figs .",
    "[ exit_vec]&[ts63_spectra ] is that the account for the backscattered particles does not change qualitatively the energy spectra of the protons leaving the 20 mpc sphere .",
    "doubling the propagation distance to 40 mpc creates changes in the energy spectra that are consistent with the increased proton energy loss .",
    "qualitatively the energy spectra measured at the two distances show similar features depending on the exit position .",
    "a second concern is that the simulation does not account for possible sources outside the simulation volume .",
    "this is a complex problem involving the density of sources , their history and spectrum , etc . at high energy ,",
    "one may presume that uhecrs will travel along nearly straight trajectories . for a mean separation of sources short compared to cosmological distances ,",

    "it follows that we may observe sources in uhecrs but have no direct knowledge of the source spectra at energies below about @xmath100 ev .",
    "in fact , just such effects are seen in our main simulation .",

    "high energy particles are seen to exit all on the side opposite from where they enter .",
    "those which enter in the sgp are , for the most part , deflected into the @xmath53 hemisphere .",
    "lower energy particles show a different pattern of exit points .",
    "those injected in the @xmath109 hemisphere drift across the sphere and exit on the @xmath68 side . those injected with @xmath92 are in the region where drift is in the @xmath110 direction and , indeed , we see almost all low energy particles that exit with @xmath92 also exit with @xmath111 . this is a fundamentally different behavior than is seen with the central source . in the central source simulation , particles were injected in the high field , but zero gradient , region at the center of the sgp .",
    "low energy particles diffuse along the field lines , eventually exiting from either the front or back of the simulation volume .",
    "only a few particles have initial energies and trajectories such that their motion is dominated by drift . for the external source ,",

    "a few low energy particles injected into the sgp , i.e. @xmath112 mpc , tend to diffuse along field lines and also exit within the sgp , explaining the halo of exit points at the edge of the projection .    .",
    "[ fig : ts8spec ] , width=321 ]    figure [ fig : ts8pos ] shows , once again , that in the presence of coherent magnetic fields , the flux density and spectrum observed depend on the location of the observer . to illustrate this further , in figure [ fig : ts8spec ]",

    "none of the spectra are particularly unusual , once the field geometry is accounted for , but they reinforce the conclusion that different observers will measure different spectra depending on their observation point relative to the local field geometry .",
    "the details depend on the source , as is seen by the different emphasis placed on diffusion and drift in the two simulations , but generically one requires a knowledge of field configuration in order to infer properties of the source from local observations of the particle flux .",
    "our model assumes a steady state source , however , many models for uhecr sources are variable , episodic , or one shot explosions .",
    "it seems clear that any energy dependent transport process will result in an instantaneous observed spectrum that differs from the source spectrum . to study this",
    "we return to the central source simulation and examine the time delays as particles exit the simulation .",
    "the time delay is defined as @xmath120 , with @xmath121 being the injection time .     , width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : ts3tdelay ] shows the spectra of particles that exit the 20 mpc sphere in four bins of @xmath122 .",
    "generally , particles that exit promptly are those with high energy , where the delays are small and only due to slight bending of the particle trajectories in the simulation s magnetic field .",
    "particles that exit late are particles of low energy , which have enhanced path lengths within the simulation during their diffusive transport .",
    "figure [ fig : ts3tdelay ] shows the spectra averaged over the whole sphere .",
    "more detailed patterns can be observed patch by patch .",
    "the main point here is that different observers , here separated in time , will observe different spectra .",
    "as before , we conclude that a program to turn observational data into statements of source spectra must take into account the possibility of organized extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "we propagate protons of energy above 10@xmath96 ev in the presence of regular and random extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the propagation is limited to the cosmologically small distances of 20 to 40 mpc .",
    "we chose to have a single particle source in order to achieve a better understanding of the proton propagation .",
    "the observers in this scheme are located on the surface of a 20 mpc or a 40 mpc sphere with the source in the center .",
    "the regular magnetic field is configured along a 3 mpc wide ` supergalactic plane ' .",
    "our general conclusions are that the particle densities inside the 20 mpc sphere , as well as the particle fluxes leaving the 20 and 40 mpc spheres , depend strongly on the relative positions of the observers to the magnetic field directions .",
    "lower energy particles are captured and channeled through the ` supergalactic plane ' both in the direction parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field .    to quantify better the energy spectra of the protons leaving the 20 mpc sphere in different locations we position several caps at different angles and distances from the magnetic wall . at the exit from the 20 mpc sphere inside the magnetic wall and on the same field line as the source ( the caps _ front _ and _ back _ in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the proton flux at around 10@xmath1 ev exceeds the injection spectrum by almost two orders of magnitude .    for particles exiting through caps that are at positions normal to the magnetic field direction and the sgp ( _ side _ and _ yz _ ) ,",
    "there is a lack of lower energy particles .",
    "those of energy below about 10@xmath62 ev , that are enhanced in the first two caps , are depleted since they lack the magnetic rigidity to cross field lines to reach these caps .",
    "the energy spectra in caps _ top _ and _ xz _ show intermediate spectra .",
    "although direct propagation into these patches is strongly suppressed at low and intermediate energy , these caps capture a population of particles that drift along the edges of the sgp .",
    "overall we could not find a position on the 20 mpc sphere where the energy spectrum of the exiting particles resembled the injection spectrum .",
    "the fluxes of particles above 10@xmath2 ev are only mildly affected by the position of the observer .",
    "only a small fraction of these particles are contained in the ` supergalactic plane ' and the corresponding flux enhancement is minimal .",
    "although reproducing the source beam pattern , the spectrum in this region is strongly affected by energy loss processes due to scattering off the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the change in the flux density does not translate into anisotropic angular distribution for the particles that leave the 20 mpc sphere along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the lower energy particles that are contained by the magnetic structure gyrate around the field lines and arrive at the _ front _ cap with almost isotropic angular distribution .",
    "some degree of anisotropy can be seen at other locations that are reached only by higher energy protons . even there",
    "the particle arrival angles do not coincide with the source direction and are strongly influenced by secondary propagation effects , such as drifts .    in order to study the possible ` edge effects ' related to the short propagation distance and the existence of only a single source ,",
    "we propagate protons in a larger , 40 mpc sphere , concentric to the primary one .",
    "all protons that cross the 20 mpc sphere , independent of their direction , are recorded , as well as those that leave the 40 mpc sphere .",
    "the comparison between the positions in which the protons leave the two spheres and the energy spectra at the sphere crossings show qualitatively similar pictures . in both cases the lower energy particles",
    "are confined to the ` supergalactic plane ' where the particle fluxes are significantly higher .",
    "the addition of the backscattered protons to the _ front _ cap at 20 mpc increases the 10@xmath1 ev excess over the injection spectrum .",
    "the energy spectrum of protons that leave the 40 mpc hemisphere through its _ front _ cap is influenced by the additional propagation distance , but with similar qualitative features .",
    "we also study the effects of the magnetic field on protons injected by an external source by simulating the propagation of a plane front of protons moving in direction @xmath101 = ( 1,0,0 ) .",
    "the quantitative effects in this scenario are different from these of a central source , but they are still caused by the proton motion in the magnetic field and generate significant angular deflection and changes in the ` detected ' proton energy spectra .",
    "if the uhe protons are injected by an impulsive process , such as a gamma ray burst in the center of the 20 mpc sphere , the proton exit spectrum depends heavily on the time delay after the burst .",
    "the fast particles arrive first , while the low energy ones suffer delays up to , and occasionally exceeding 1.3@xmath7310@xmath123 yrs .",
    "there are three reasons for performing the research that we described .",
    "first , the presence or absence of a gzk cut - off is considered fundamental to understanding the sources and propagation of uhecr .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the possible presence of large scale 10 ng fields complicates the interpretation of uhecr data .",
    "the second one is related to the derivation of the uhecr source luminosity , which is usually done in the vicinity of 10@xmath1 ev .",
    "the simulations that we performed emphasize the importance of accounting for the possible existence of ordered extragalactic magnetic fields . in their presence , the energy spectrum of particles emitted from a cosmologically nearby source depends very strongly on the relative position of the source and observer to the direction of the ordered magnetic field .",
    "neglecting these fields could lead to big errors in the estimate of the uhecr luminosity .",
    "the third reason is a study of the correlation between particle fluxes and arrival direction distribution . even in the case of a single uhecr source , which we discuss in this paper ,",
    "we could not find such a correlation , except for the highest energy protons .",
    "the enhanced particle fluxes in directions parallel to the magnetic field are almost isotropic , because of the gyration of the protons around the magnetic field lines .",
    "an observer in the _ front _ cap would not be able to recognize the direction of our single source , except in the case of very large experimental statistics . only by the observations of cosmic rays of energy exceeding 10@xmath2",
    "ev one would be able to see some clustering around the source direction .",
    "the dividing energy between diffusive and almost rectilinear propagation in our calculations is of order 10@xmath62 ev .",
    "there are some experimental indications , based on a part of the world uhecr statistics  @xcite that there is an increase in the anisotropy of these particles at energies above 10@xmath82 ev .",
    "if this or a similar observation is confirmed in the future , it would suggest the existence of ordered magnetic fields of order 20 ng in our cosmological neighbourhood .",
    "our main conclusion is that the energy spectra and angular distribution of protons accelerated both at a nearby or at a distant source are strongly affected by modest regular extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "this is valid independently of the model for uhecr production .",
    "thus , it is important to allow for the possibility of large scale magnetic fields in uhecr data analysis and source searches . on the other hand ,",
    "if a source of uhecr in a relatively wide energy range is identified in the nearby universe , and high experimental statistics exist as expected from the currently active and future experiments  @xcite , one could study the strength and geometry of extragalactic magnetic fields that are not accessible in any other way , utilizing techniques suggested by this research .",
