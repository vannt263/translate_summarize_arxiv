    ".    to get the final correlator , we put the supergravity quanta in wavepackets around the locations @xmath223 ; these wavepakets are narrow in the @xmath183 direction ( where their width is much smaller than @xmath224 ) and in the the momentum space ( where they are picked around @xmath225 with width @xmath226 ) large compared to the wavelength of the supergravity quanta . ] .",
    "this leads to the physical amplitude _ -^_-^dk dk to recap , this expression gives the amplitude for the process where a supergravity quantum in one spherical harmonic hits the d1d5 bound state in a wavepacket localized around @xmath227 , and emerges with a different harmonic in a wavepacket localized around @xmath228 .",
    "although the two  point function entering the gravity amplitude ( [ gravampl ] ) is rather complicated , an important physical effect can be extracted from its scaling with @xmath19 , which is given by the combinatorial factor in ( [ flrgn ] ) : [ lrgnmain ] a_k,|k~n^-(k+|k)/2 in particular , we find that the amplitude for going to the final state rotated by @xmath229 units is suppressed as @xmath230 . in this paper we considered a transition to a very special state ( which is a rotation of the initial vacuum ) , but if such suppression persists for more general final states , it would have important consequences for the dynamics of black holes : it would imply that are given state of a hole can not transition to all @xmath231 states .    to investigate this question",
    "further , in appendix [ applrgn ] we analyzed a large @xmath19 behavior of a more general amplitude .",
    "as in ( [ cyl2pt ] ) , we took the initial ramond vacuum to be the highest weight state with @xmath232 , but we allowed the final vacuum to have different @xmath233 quantum numberssu(2 ) rotation , so the only assumption is @xmath232 . ] .",
    "notice that the final state in ( [ cyl2pt ] ) , ( [ flrgn ] ) has j=,j_3=-k;=,_3=-|k . in appendix [ applrgn ]",
    "we analyzed the transitions to the ramond vacua with j , j_3=-k;,_3=-|k .",
    "and we found that only states with @xmath234 are allowed , and the scaling of the transition amplitude is given by ( [ finconj ] ) : [ finconjmain ] a_j , k;j,|k~n^-(k+|k)/2 n^(-j)/2 since @xmath235 and @xmath236 , we find that j-(k,|k ) , and for given @xmath237 the minimal suppression happens when the last inequality is saturated .",
    "for example , if @xmath229 , then the minimal suppression is [ minsuppr ] a_-k , k ;- k , k~n^-k/2 .",
    "to summarize , we found that a transition from a ramond vacuum with @xmath238 can only happen to a vacuum with @xmath234 , and the relevant amplitude scales as ( [ finconjmain ] ) , where @xmath239 , @xmath240 . for a given value of @xmath229 ,",
    "the suppression becomes minimal if @xmath241 , and it is given by ( [ minsuppr ] ) .",
    "one of the most important features of a black hole is a large number of degenerate states .",
    "thus a quantum can fall into a hole in one state and emerge later in some other mode , while changing the state of the black hole as well . to study the dynamics of the hawking radiation",
    ", one should get a better understanding of this absorption / emission process , in particular , one should determine whether the full space of degenerate states is being explored , or gravitational quanta can only cause transitions between ` nearby states ' of the black hole .    the simplest absorption / emission process does not change states of the black hole and of the infalling quantum . the relevant amplitude can be computed by solving the wave equation for the quantum on the background geometry produced by the black hole microstate ; for the state discussed here , this computation was done in @xcite . for more complicated processes , where the quantum and the black hole state change their spins ,",
    "the gravity computation becomes more involved since it requires a gravitational coupling vertex . rather than solving this problem at strong coupling",
    ", we analyzed its counterpart at weak coupling by going to the dual cft , and one may hope that general features of the scattering matrix would be similar in the two limits .",
    "it would be very interesting to perform an independent gravity calculation and to see whether a remarkable agreement between the cft and gravity correlators @xcite persists for the amplitudes derived here .",
    "alternatively , one can try to find corrections to our results caused by the deformation from the free orbifold cft following the ideas of @xcite .",
    "in this paper we studied transitions between the ramond vacuum with largest allowed spin and its su(2)@xmath242su(2 ) rotations .",
    "we found that the black hole does not jump between different degenerate states with equal probability .",
    "in particular , the amplitude for the spin of the hole to change by @xmath0 units is suppressed by @xmath243 . in section [ subslrgn ]",
    "we studied the large @xmath19 scaling for more general transitions from the maximally rotated state , and we found that for the given value of @xmath0 , it is the transition to the state with the lowest allowed angular momentum that dominates , although its amplitude is still suppressed by @xmath244 relative to the trivial case .",
    "these results are in line with the expectation that the transition which does not alter the state of the hole has the maximal amplitude : this case corresponds to propagation of the infalling quantum on the background geometry of the microstate .",
    "scaling of amplitudes by different powers of @xmath19 suggests that some pairs of microstates are ` close ' , and other pairs are ` far away ' in the set of all ramond vacua , and it would be interesting to find an ` effective metric ' to quantify this distinction by extending our results to arbitrary initial states .    we should note that the initial state studied in this paper is very special : it has the maximal spin allowed for the d1d5 system , so any transition to another state is accompanied by a change in angular momentum , which eventually led to the suppression of the corresponding amplitude . in the generic case , we expect to find more ramond vacua in the ` vicinity ' of the initial state , so it should become very _ easy _ for the black hole to change its state when hit by an infalling quantum",
    ". it would be interesting to repeat our analysis for generic initial states and to find the ` effective metric ' on the space of all ramond vacua .",
