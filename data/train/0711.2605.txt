    "given any metric space @xmath0 with the topology and local geometry required of the surface of a convex three - dimensional body , there is exactly one convex body up to isometry whose surface has the intrinsic geometry of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the endpoint of a line of research pursued in the middle of the last century by alexandrov and pogorelov @xcite , and it implies a strong correspondence between the geometry of a convex body and the intrinsic geometry of its surface . on the other hand , the exact nature of this correspondence is not yet well understood  which properties in the surface geometry imply what properties in the body geometry , and vice versa .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is a _",
    "d - form _ , obtained by sewing together two smooth convex shapes of the same perimeter , then even for this special case the most basic questions are open .",
    "these forms were invented by an artist @xcite and introduced into the literature in @xcite .",
    "the latter study poses three problems : ( 1 ) when is the d - form the convex hull of a space curve , ( 2 ) when are the two pieces free of creases , and ( 3 ) how can one compute the d - form numerically from the two shapes .",
    "a later treatment @xcite suggests an informal argument for problem 1 ( arguing that the d - form is always the convex hull of its seam ) and leaves problems 2 and 3 open .",
    "the same book @xcite introduces also a related special case where @xmath0 is obtained by sewing up a single smooth convex shape along its boundary in one seam , calling these _ pita - forms _ and suggesting , based on paper experiments , that pita - forms might never have creases .",
    "we resolve problems 1 and 2 : both d - forms and pita - forms are always the convex hull of their seams , and ( excluding the seam ) d - forms are always free of creases but a pita - form may have one crease .",
    "our results apply to a natural generalization of both d - forms and pita - forms , the _ seam form _ , which roughly consists of intrinsically flat pieces joined along finitely many seams .",
    "because the original sources of the problem are stated informally , we first introduce precise definitions that we believe capture the intuitive picture .",
    "then we show the following theorems :    [ t : convex - hull - general ] every three - dimensional convex body is the convex hull of the nonflat points on its surface .",
    "[ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] every seam form is the convex hull of its seams and vertices .",
    "[ t : no - creases - seam - form ] in a flat component of a seam form , every crease lies on a line segment composed of creases , and each endpoint of such a segment is either a strict vertex or a point of tangency to a seam .",
    "[ c : no - creases - d - form ] the flat components of a d - form are without creases ; in the flat component of a pita - form , the only crease(s ) make up the line segment between the endpoints of the seam .    intuitively the line segment between a pita - form s endpoints in corollary  [ c : no - creases - d - form ] should be thought of as one `` crease '' ; it is a consequence of our definitions , below , that this segment may be arbitrarily subdivided into several segments we call creases .",
    "problem 3 , to efficiently compute the three - dimensional shape of a d - form or seam form from its two - dimensional intrinsic geometry , has now been largely resolved . to make this problem well posed",
    ", one needs a finite representation of the input geometry , which is most naturally done by a piecewise - linear or polyhedral approximation . with considerable effort , the problem of reconstructing a three - dimensional convex polyhedron from its intrinsic geometry can be reduced to the solution of a high - dimensional ordinary differential equation  @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation appears to be achievable efficiently in practice , and is provably achievable within pseudopolynomial time  @xcite .",
    "we introduce terminology in section  2 , prove theorem  [ t : convex - hull - general ] and its corollary  [ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] in section  3 , and prove theorem  [ t : no - creases - seam - form ] and its corollary  [ c : no - creases - d - form ] in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we describe counterexamples that show the necessity of some of the hypotheses in our results .",
    "for us a _ surface _ is a metric 2-manifold embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the surface is @xmath2 if the manifold and its embedding are @xmath2 .",
    "the surface is _",

    "a _ good surface _ is a piecewise-@xmath3 surface .",
    "a good surface @xmath0 therefore decomposes into a union of @xmath3 surfaces @xmath4 , called _ pieces _ , @xmath3 edges @xmath5 , which we call _ semicreases _ , and vertices .",
    "if @xmath0 is itself @xmath6 everywhere on a semicrease , we call it a _ proper semicrease _ ; otherwise it is a _",

    "a surface or part of a surface is called flat if all of its points are flat .",
    "a surface @xmath0 is _ convex _ if @xmath7 for some bounded convex body @xmath8 in @xmath1 .",
    "normal _ to a convex body @xmath8 at a point @xmath9 is a unit vector @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the relation between points on the boundary of @xmath8 and their normals is traditionally called the _ gauss map _ , though it need not be a map  one point may have many normals .",

    "observe that @xmath12 is always a convex subset of the sphere .",
    "a consequence of gauss celebrated theorema egregium  @xcite is that a convex surface @xmath15 is flat just if @xmath13 has zero area .",

    "an _ extreme point _ of @xmath8 is a point @xmath20 not traversed by any line .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ t : convex - hull - general ] , that every three - dimensional convex body is the convex hull of the nonflat points on its surface .    from convex geometry",
    "we have the following characterization of the minimal set from which a convex body can be recovered as the convex hull : we need only the extreme points .    [",
    "t : hull - of - extreme ] every convex body in @xmath21 is the convex hull of its extreme points .    the proof is a straightforward induction on the dimension of the body and can be found as corollary 1.4.5 in schneider s textbook @xcite .",
    "it remains to describe the extreme points of a seam form .",
    "to do so we begin with the following proposition :    [ p : extreme - separate ] if @xmath22 is an extreme point of the convex body @xmath8 , then for every open neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath22 in @xmath8 , some hyperplane has @xmath22 strictly on one side and all of @xmath23 strictly on the other .",
    "this is lemma 1.4.6 in @xcite . for completeness",
    "we give the proof .",
    "because @xmath22 is an extreme point , it can not by definition be the convex combination of any two other points in @xmath8 .",
    "therefore it is not the convex combination @xmath24 , with all @xmath25 , of any @xmath26 other points in @xmath8 , because otherwise we would have @xmath27 , and certainly the convex combination @xmath28 is a point in @xmath8 . in other words , @xmath22 lies outside the convex hull of @xmath29 , and consequently outside the convex hull @xmath30 of @xmath23 .",
    "now @xmath30 is itself a convex body , and @xmath22 a point outside it . by the separating hyperplane theorem ,",
    "some hyperplane strictly separates them , and because @xmath31 , it strictly separates @xmath22 and @xmath23 as required .",
    "[ p : flat - no - extreme ] on the surface of a convex body , there are no flat extreme points .",
    "suppose some extreme point @xmath22 of a convex body @xmath8 was flat , with a neighborhood @xmath32 isometric to a plane region .",
    "let @xmath15 be an open neighborhood of @xmath22 in @xmath8 with @xmath33 .",
    "let the hyperplane @xmath34 guaranteed by proposition  [ p : extreme - separate ] separate @xmath8 into convex bodies @xmath35 and @xmath30 with @xmath36 , and let @xmath37 . because @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 so that @xmath40 is flat .    now consider the normals to @xmath8 along the portion @xmath40 of its surface .",
    "let @xmath41 be the distance from @xmath22 to @xmath34 , and let @xmath42 be the maximum distance from the projection of @xmath22 onto @xmath34 to any point in @xmath43 . then any plane through @xmath22 and making an angle at most @xmath44 to @xmath34 fails to intersect @xmath43 and therefore fails to intersect @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the normals to these planes , covering a spherical area of @xmath45 , all are normals to @xmath8 somewhere on  @xmath40 .",
    "this gives @xmath46 a positive area , contradicting that @xmath39 is flat .",
    "theorem  [ t : convex - hull - general ] is now immediate from theorem  [ t : hull - of - extreme ] and proposition  [ p : flat - no - extreme ] , and corollary  [ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] follows .",

    "then @xmath47 lies on a line segment @xmath48 $ ] between endpoints @xmath22 and @xmath49 that lie on seams , and the whole segment is composed of creases and vertices .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be the open pieces bordered by @xmath47 in the decomposition of the good surface  @xmath0 , and let @xmath52 be a point at which @xmath0 is not  @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath3 surfaces , so they have normals @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath9 , and because @xmath0 is not @xmath6 at @xmath9 , these normals are distinct",
    ". therefore @xmath12 contains at least two distinct vectors .    by proposition  [ p : flat - no - extreme ] , @xmath9 must be traversed by some line @xmath18 , so that @xmath55 $ ] for some @xmath22 and @xmath49 .",
    "necessarily @xmath18 is perpendicular to all of @xmath12 , so for each @xmath56 $ ] and each normal @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath10 is a normal of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore each @xmath60 contains @xmath12 , and so like @xmath12 has at least two distinct vectors .",
    "the multiple normals in @xmath12 and hence in each @xmath60 determine a unique perpendicular line , so that no other line may traverse any point of @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "in particular no line traverses @xmath22 or @xmath49 , so by proposition  [ p : flat - no - extreme ] , these points are not flat and must lie on seams or vertices .    at the same time , because a @xmath6 surface has only one normal at each point , no point of @xmath61 $ ] can be on a @xmath3 piece or a semicrease .",
    "the whole segment is therefore made up of creases and ( nonstrict ) vertices .",
    "because a crease is defined from a cell - complex decomposition , only one crease runs through a given point , so because @xmath47 runs through @xmath9 it must be one of the creases making up @xmath61 $ ] .    in order to analyze the gauss map at seam and vertex points",
    ", we introduce some additional notation .",
    "let @xmath62 be incident to a 1- or 2-cell @xmath35 , a ( semi)crease or piece",
    ". then we define @xmath63 as the _ gauss map at @xmath9 on @xmath35_. for comparison , observe that @xmath64 because the relation @xmath65 is closed , and in particular @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath47 be a crease in a flat component of a seam form @xmath0 . by proposition  [ p : flat - crease - segment ]",
    ", @xmath47 lies on a segment @xmath61 $ ] composed of creases and vertices and whose endpoints lie on seams .",
    "it remains to prove that if an endpoint , say @xmath22 , lies on a seam and is not a strict vertex , then the seam is tangent to @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath67 be the great circular arc @xmath68 , and let the pieces of @xmath0 bordering @xmath47 be @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by continuity , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( possibly after exchanging the names @xmath71 ) , and because @xmath72 the gauss map at @xmath22 on at least one of the cells @xmath35 surrounding @xmath22 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 apart from @xmath47 must be a positive - length spherical curve in order to complete the path from @xmath73 to @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath22 is not a strict vertex , then @xmath74 is a convex spherical shape of zero area , so it is a great circular arc , and @xmath75 is also a great circular arc . if @xmath35 is a piece , then @xmath76 is either a singleton or a curve not lying on a great circle , because a great - circle gauss map makes parallel rule lines that can not converge at @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath35 is a semicrease . because @xmath77 must be more than a single point",
    ", @xmath35 is a crease , and to make the gauss map lie within the arc @xmath74 , @xmath35 must be tangent to @xmath48 $ ] as required .",
    "finally , because @xmath22 is the endpoint of the intersection of the line @xmath78 with @xmath0 , the crease @xmath35 must not be a line segment , so by proposition  [ p : flat - crease - segment ] , it is actually part of the seam and the proof is complete .    of course , in a convex plane region , no line segment in the interior is tangent to the boundary , from which follows a corollary about simple seam forms .",
    "[ c : no - creases - doubly - convex ] in a simple seam form , every crease in a flat component is on a line segment between two strict vertices .",
    "finally , in a simple smooth seam form such as a pita - form or a d - form , the requirement of smoothness sharply limits the possible configurations . by ( local )",
    "convexity , no vertex can be incident to three or more semicreases as part of its seam , and a vertex through which a seam passes can not be a strict vertex .",
    "consequently a pita - form must have a single path for its seam and just two strict vertices located at the seam s endpoints , and a d - form must have a single cycle for its seam and no strict vertices .",
    "corollary [ c : no - creases - d - form ] follows .",
    "we have required the flat components of a d - form to be convex .",
    "we could relax this requirement , requiring instead only that the metric space resulting from joining the two components be locally convex , and the  alexandrov - pogorelov theorem would still guarantee a unique convex embedding in three - dimensional space .",
    "of course corollary [ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] would still guarantee that the resulting body would be the convex hull of its seam , but it turns out that corollary [ c : no - creases - d - form ] , whose conditions would no longer be satisfied , really would fail in its conclusion : one can construct a `` d - form '' under this relaxed definition which contains creases in its flat components . indeed it is not hard to construct such an example , if one keeps in mind theorem [ t : no - creases - seam - form ] that the offending crease must be tangent to a seam ; see figure [ f : d - form - creased ] .        for pita - forms",
    ", we have concluded in corollary [ c : no - creases - d - form ] that a pita - form may have at most one crease .",
    "indeed this is tight , and it is easy to construct an example pita - form with a crease ; see figure [ f : pita - form ] .",
    "this possibility of creases therefore represents a real difference from d - forms .",
    "it represents also a contrast from the appearance of the natural paper experiments , which led the authors first introducting pita - forms ( @xcite ) to suggest that pita - forms might never have creases ; in fact , once one is familiar with corollary [ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] , it is clear that the same experiments really would have to be creased if  only the paper were behaving ideally .        for some theorems of the same flavor as our results here , one might hope to obtain proofs by showing that the desired properties hold of convex polyhedra , which are relatively concrete and amenable to reasoning , and then that they carry over to general convex bodies as limits of polyhedra .",
    "indeed , this is the approach taken in @xcite to argue for corollary [ c : convex - hull - seam - form ] for the case of d - forms .",
    "unfortunately this approach does not hold as widely as one might like .",
    "in particular , corollary [ c : no - creases - doubly - convex ] can not be proven by a limiting argument of the obvious form , even when restricted to d - forms . when each flat component of the d - form is approximated by a sequence of polygons , it is possible for the dihedral angles inside the components to approach positive limits , even when the angles of the polygonal approximations are required to converge to zero .",
    "for example , in the d - form obtained from two circular disks ( which is just the double cover of a disk ) , the components may be approximated by regular @xmath10-gons for increasing @xmath10 , and the resulting approximations to the d - form may be antiprisms of two smaller @xmath10-gons and @xmath79 triangles . in this approximation sequence , the dihedral angles between each @xmath10-gon and its @xmath10 neighboring triangles approach @xmath80 , not zero , even though they lie inside the flat components .",
    "for this and other reasons we have chosen direct proofs that attack the general case of convex bodies .",
