    "we formulate our problem as a coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) where we want to reconstruct an unknown spatially distributed wave speed of the acoustic wave equation from boundary measurements on the adaptively refined meshes . to solve our cip , we minimize the tikhonov functional , where we want to find the wave speed distribution with prescribed scattering properties of the designed structure . in the case of numerical simulations of section [ sec : numex ]",
    "we formulate these properties as obtaining as small as possible backscattered reflections from the designed structure .",
    "for minimization of the tikhonov functional we use lagrangian approach and search for a stationary point of it on the adaptively refined meshes . compared with other works on this subject",
    "@xcite we need to refine mesh locally only inside the known geometry . for construction of a new mesh we use symmetric mesh refinement strategy combined with the interpolation procedure over the neighboring vertices for every element in the mesh .",
    "this allows us finally to get acoustic material of the symmetric structure .    to construct the desired wave speed function we formulate an adaptive optimization algorithm which includes solution of the forward and adjoint problems for the acoustic wave equation",
    "the domain decomposition finite element / finite difference ( fe / fd ) method of @xcite is used for the computational solution of these problems .",
    "this method is implemented efficiently using the software packages waves @xcite and petsc @xcite . in the theoretical part of this work we present proofs of the energy estimates for a hyperbolic equation with one unknown function - the wave speed- and different boundary conditions for the case of our domain decomposition .",
    "we illustrate efficiency of the proposed method on the construction of new acoustic material in two dimensions .",
    "the goal of our numerical simulations is to reconstruct the wave speed function of the hyperbolic equation from single observations of the backscattered solution of this equation in space and time which gives us as small backscattered reflections as possible .",
    "we note that the domain decomposition approach in this case is particularly feasible for implementing of absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "applications of the proposed method of adaptive optimization can be used in the construction and design of new materials including nano - materials with so - called cloaking properties with the first works on this subject @xcite , see review of this technique in @xcite . to obtain cloaking structures in all these works methods of transformational optics",
    "are used which present accordance between material parameters and coordinate transformations . in the current work",
    "we propose to use an adaptive optimization algorithm which is an alternative approach for the construction of an approximate cloaking .",
    "depending on applications , this method can be used alone or as a compliment to the method of transformational optics .",
    "advantage of a new technique compared to the transformational optics is fast construction of any material of arbitrary geometry with desired symmetric structure of any size .",
    "this structure is not dependent on the coordinate transformation and can be adapted to the desired properties of the physical material .",
    "the size of the symmetric structure can be defined as a parameter in the adaptive mesh refinement procedure used in the optimization algorithm .",
    "thus , the new algorithm allows efficiently compute a new material of the symmetric structure with desired properties . a first version of a such algorithm was presented in @xcite for the design of a nanophotonic structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : modelhyb ] we present statements of the forward and inverse problems and in section [ sec : opt ] we describe the lagrangian approach for solution of our cip .",
