    "a fundamental but still unsolved issue is the origin of the hubble sequence and the formation of the spheroidal and disk components of present - day galaxies .",

    "mid - ir photometry at @xmath36 with irac and at 24  with mips for the majority of our targets .",
    "prior to the sinfoni observations , near - ir long - slit spectroscopy was obtained for all of our nic2 targets with nirspec at the keck  ii telescope and isaac at the vlt by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the choice of our nic2 targets was primarily driven by their kinematic nature along with their high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , high quality sinfoni data mapping the spatial distribution and relative gas motions from h@xmath6 out to radii @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "they include five rotating disks ( bx663 , md41 , bx389 , bx610 , and bx482 ) , and one major merger ( bx528 ) .",
    "the quantitative kinematic classification performed through application of kinemetry is described by @xcite , and detailed dynamical modeling of the disks is presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disks show the expected signatures of a fairly ordered two - dimensional velocity field , with a monotonic gradient across the source and flattening of the velocity curve at large radii , alignment of the h@xmath6 kinematic and morphological major axes , and peak of the velocity dispersion close to the dynamical and geometrical center .",
    "in contrast , bx528 exhibits a reversal in velocity gradient along the major axis , as observed in nearby counter - rotating binary mergers .",
    "interestingly , the h@xmath6 morphology of this merger from the seeing - limited sinfoni data does not show features that would distinguish it from the disks ; all sources have extended , more or less irregular / clumpy h@xmath6 distributions at a typical seeing - limited resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "two of our targets ( bx663 and bx610 ) are candidate agn hosts on the basis of their observed mid - ir spectral energy distributions from _ spitzer _ irac and mips photometry ( * ? ? ?",

    "bx663 also exhibits spectral signatures of type 2 agn in its integrated rest - uv and rest - optical spectrum @xcite . in our spatially - resolved sinfoni data ( as well as the new nic2 imaging presented in this paper ) , the host galaxy is well detected and can be distinguished from the central compact emission peak with higher [ ] /h@xmath6 and broad h@xmath6 velocity component associated with the agn , underneath the narrower component dominated by star formation . in contrast , bx610 exhibits no sign of agn in the rest - frame uv and optical , including the spatially- and spectrally - resolved sinfoni data , so that its agn is likely to be very obscured and will not affect any aspect of our analysis .",
    "therefore , in the context of this paper , we will only consider bx663 explicitly as an agn source .",
    "the sinfoni data sets of our nic2 targets are fully described by @xcite .",
    "they are among the deepest of the sins survey , with on - source integration times in the @xmath7-band ( targeting the h@xmath6 and [ ] @xmath39 emission lines ) ranging from 3 to 7.3 hours .",
    "all galaxies were first observed using the largest pixel scale ( @xmath40 ) , five of them in seeing - limited mode under very good seeing conditions , and one of them ( bx663 ) with the aid of ao using a nearby natural guide star .",
    "the typical effective angular resolution of these sinfoni @xmath7-band data has a @xmath41 , corresponding to @xmath42 at the redshift of the sources ( @xmath43 or 3.2  kpc for the ngs - ao data of bx663 ) .",
    "seeing - limited @xmath44 band data were taken for all but bx528 to map the [ ] @xmath45 and h@xmath46 emission lines , also under very good near - ir seeing of @xmath47 and using the @xmath40 scale .",
    "in addition , laser guide star ( lgs ) ao - assisted @xmath7 band observations were obtained for bx482 using the intermediate pixel scale of @xmath48 , with total on - source integration time of 6.8hours and effective resolution of @xmath49 ( 1.4  kpc ) , very similar to that of the nic2 1.6  imaging .    the central averaged h@xmath6 surface brightness ( within the h@xmath6 half - light radius ) of the nic2 targets range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . using the conversion factor of @xcite between h@xmath6 luminosity and star formation rate , divided by 1.7 to scale from a @xcite to a @xcite imf , and accounting for beam - smearing in computing the intrinsic physical area ,",
    "we calculate star formation rates per unit area of @xmath52 ( uncorrected for dust extinction ) . the median s / n per pixel of the h@xmath6 maps over the regions where line emission is detected ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) are @xmath54 for the six galaxies . from the velocity - integrated line maps and from the noise properties of the data cubes ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath55 h@xmath6 surface brightness sensitivities are typically @xmath56 , corresponding to a limiting star formation rate of @xmath57 .",
    "the nicmos observations were carried out between 2007 april and 2007 september with the nic2 camera onboard the _ hst _ and using the f160w filter ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath58 bandpass ) .",
    "the @xmath58 bandpass , centered at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , probes the longest wavelengths at which the _ hst _ thermal emission is unimportant , taking full advantage of the lack of sky background that limits the sensitivity of ground - based near - ir observations .",
    "nic2 has a pixel scale of @xmath61 , critically sampling the _ hst _ point spread function ( psf ) at 1.6 , and a field of view of @xmath62 . while the nic3 camera has greater surface brightness sensitivity , nic2 offers the best combination of resolution and sensitivity for our science goals , and also allows more consistent comparisons with the available _",
    "hst_/acs imaging of md41 and sinfoni@xmath63ao observations of bx482 , which have comparable or better resolution than nic2 .",
    "each target was observed for four orbits , with each orbit split into four exposures with a subpixel dither pattern to ensure good sampling of the psf and minimize the impact of hot / cold bad pixels and other such artifacts ( e.g. , `` grot , '' electronic bars ) .",
    "the individual exposure time was 640s , giving a total on - source integration time of 10240s .",
    "the read - out mode employed was the spars-64 multiaccum sequence with @xmath64 .",
    "we used a square four - point dither pattern with step size of @xmath65 ( 20.5 pixels ) .",

    "table  [ tab - obs ] summarizes the log of the observations .",
    "we started with the pipeline - reduced data products , processed with the stsdas task _ calnica _ , version 4.1.1 , of the * nicmos * package within the iraf environment .",
    "we refer to the nicmos data handbook for details and the description of specific instrumental features of nicmos .",
    "the steps performed in this stage include bias , zero read signal , and dark current subtraction , data linearization , correction for so - called `` electronic bars , '' flat - fielding , and conversion to count rates .",
    "the task _ calnica _ also identifies cosmic ray hits and various bad pixels .",
    "these identifications missed on a significant number of obvious bad pixels present in our data , so we extended the bad pixel lists for each exposure as described below .",
    "we then used the task _ pedsky _ in the same iraf package to subtract a first - order estimate of the background and the quadrant - dependent residual bias ( or `` pedestal '' ) in each individual exposure .",
    "we subtracted the median value along each column to correct for bias jumps .",
    "we constructed a static bad pixel mask for each galaxy based on deviant pixels in the normalized flat field and those identified by _ calnica _ with bad data quality flags . to identify remaining bad pixels and cosmic rays , we first drizzled the images for each galaxy onto a common finer pixel grid accounting for their relative shifts , the ( small ) nic2 distortion , and the static bad pixel masks , using the iraf task _ drizzle _ in the stsdas * analysis * package .",
    "a clean reference image was generated by median - combining the registered drizzled images with `` minmax '' rejection .",
    "this image was inverse - drizzled to the original pixel scale and coordinate system of each individual exposure with the task _ blot _ in the stsdas * analysis * package .",
    "we compared the `` blotted '' reference images with their corresponding input image and updated the static bad pixel mask to make a mask for each exposure .",
    "the background - subtracted exposures were again drizzled , now using the updated individual bad pixel masks , to create the combined drizzled image of each galaxy .",
    "for the drizzling , we chose an output pixel scale of @xmath68 , corresponding to that of the sinfoni@xmath63ao data of bx482 , and used a square kernel with 0.7 times the size of the input pixels ( i.e. , a `` dropsize '' of 0.7 ) .",
    "we found from experimentation that this combination of parameters gave the best results in terms of preserving the angular resolution and minimizing the impact on the pixel - to - pixel rms noise level of our nic2 data .",
    "the combined drizzled images showed substantial residual features on scales of a few tens of pixels together with residuals from vignetting at the bottom of the array .",
    "these features were successfully modeled and subtracted from the combined images using background maps generated with the sextractor software , version 2.2.2 @xcite .",
    "since our science goals require detection of low surface brightness emission of the galaxies to large radii , we took particular care in making these background maps .",
    "we masked out sufficiently large areas around each object , and then ran sextractor with a background mesh size of 24 pixels and filter size of three meshes .",
    "this combination provided the best match to the spatial frequency of the residual features , without compromising the faint extended emission from the galaxies .",
    "further linear residual features were removed by fitting second - order polynomials ( with object masking ) along columns and rows .",
    "this step also resulted in a small reduction of the pixel - to - pixel rms noise .",
    "weight maps ( for use in the determination of the noise properties and in the structural analysis ) were generated in the final combination of the exposures with the task _",
    "drizzle_. these reflect the effective total integration time at each output pixel in the drizzling procedure ( i.e. , accounting for the dropsize and the relative size of the input and output pixels as well as the bad pixel and cosmic ray masking ) .",
    "we normalized the weight maps of each galaxy to a maximum of unity .",
    "we cropped the final images and weight maps to a region @xmath69 to exclude the edges with relative weight @xmath70 .",
    "for the morphological analysis , accurate knowledge of the psf in our data is important . we empirically determined the resulting psf based on stellar profiles in our final reduced images . in total , there are four suitable stars ( isolated , sufficiently bright but unsaturated ) in three of our nic2 pointings .",
    "their profiles have a gaussian core and show airy wings at larger radii ( around @xmath71 ) . to increase the s / n , we averaged the peak - normalized stellar profiles . from a gaussian fit to the resulting empirical psf , the fwhm is @xmath72 with ellipticity of 0.08 ( or fwhm of @xmath73 and identical ellipticity of 0.08 for a moffat fit ) .",
    "relative to the average psf , the deviations of the radial profiles of the stars are at most @xmath74 ( on average @xmath75 ) out to a radius of @xmath76 , enclosing @xmath77 of the total flux and where the profiles are at @xmath78 of the peak value .",
    "the curves - of - growth of the individual stars differ by @xmath79 ( on average @xmath80 ) from that of the average psf .",
    "we adopted this empirical average psf for our analysis .",
    "the quality of the final reduced data is very uniform among our targets . to characterize the effective noise properties , we followed the approach described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for uncorrelated gaussian noise , the effective standard deviation from the mean of the background for an aperture of area @xmath81 is simply the pixel - to - pixel rms @xmath82 scaled by the linear size @xmath83 of the aperture , @xmath84 .",
    "however , instrumental features , the data reduction , and the drizzling and combination procedures have added significant systematics and correlated noise in the final data .",
    "we thus derived the function @xmath85 directly from the data by measuring the fluxes of @xmath86 non - overlapping circular apertures .",
    "we placed the apertures at random in the maps but so as to avoid pixels associated with sources down to @xmath87 , corresponding to a surface brightness of @xmath88 .",
    "series of measurements were repeated with different aperture diameters ranging from @xmath89 to 1 .",
    "for each aperture size , the distribution of fluxes is symmetric around the background value ( about 0 ) , and is well reproduced with a gaussian profile .",
    "we determined the background rms variations from the width of the best - fit gaussian to the observed distribution for each aperture size .",
    "while at any fixed spatial scale , the noise properties over the images are consistent with being gaussian , the variations with @xmath90 deviate appreciably from the scaling expected for gaussian noise , being systematically larger and increasing non - linearly .",
    "the real noise behaviour in our nic2 images can be approximated by the polynomial model : @xmath91 where the weight term @xmath92 accounts for the spatial variations in noise level related to the exposure time and is taken from the weight maps .",
    "the coefficient @xmath93 represents the effects of correlated noise , which are dominated by the resampling of the images to the final pixel scale through the drizzling procedure . the curvature in the @xmath85 relation quantified by the coefficient",
    "@xmath94 indicates a noise contribution that becomes increasingly important on larger scales . for our data ,",
    "this probably originates mostly from instrumental features , and residuals from the background subtraction and flat - fielding .",

    "in addition , two compact ( radius @xmath256 ) sources offset by @xmath122 from the main body of the galaxy appear in the acs image , alone , indicating significantly bluer colors than the main region of galaxy emission .",
    "we have not yet determined if these sources are associated with md41 . in particular",
    ", a search of the sinfoni data cube does not reveal any emission line at these locations and within @xmath257 of the h@xmath6 line of md41 , which could support a physical association .",
    "the gini values measured in the acs and nic2 images of md41 are both @xmath258 , while the multiplicity is slightly lower for the rest - frame optical image ( 6.3 ) than the rest - frame uv image ( 9.7 with the two offset objects included and 8.1 without ) .",
    "the @xmath5 values are comparable as well , with @xmath259 in the rest - frame optical and @xmath260 in the rest - frame uv . while the parameters and appearance in each band are not identical , we stress that the differences are not significant .",
    "md41 does not display a strong morphological `` @xmath261-correction , '' according to which the rest - frame uv and optical morphologies would trace light from very different stellar populations .",
    "similar comparative studies of the rest - uv and optical morphologies of samples of @xmath262 galaxies based on acs optical and recent wfc3 @xmath58 band imaging are presented by @xcite and @xcite .    for another object in the sample , bx482 , the sinfoni h@xmath6 map obtained with lgs - ao and @xmath49 psf fwhm @xcite is of sufficient resolution and s / n to measure the detailed morphological parameters using the same methodology and compare with the nic2 @xmath58 band properties .",
    "we plot the morphological parameters derived from the h@xmath6 map of bx482 in figure  [ fig - morph1 ] , along with the nic2-based parameters .",
    "the h@xmath6 line and @xmath58 band morphologies are quite similar in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , with the prominent high surface brightness clump appearing in both sinfoni and nic2 images .",
    "we searched for correlations between the morphological ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and stellar population parameters ( @xmath151 , age , @xmath149 , absolute and specific sfr ) .",
    "the most significant ( @xmath55 ) trend is found between stellar mass and @xmath3 , such that more massive galaxies are characterized by higher @xmath3 values .",
    "correlations between @xmath3 and other gauges of galaxy evolutionary state such as age and specific sfr , are not readily apparent within our sample .",
    "however , our sample of six objects is obviously too small for discerning all but the strongest trends .",
    "furthermore , with only actively star - forming galaxies in our sample , we do not probe the full dynamic range of @xmath0 star - forming histories . in section  [ sect - comp ] , we return to the connection between morphology and other galaxy properties , considering our sins sample alongside @xmath0 galaxies selected using very different criteria @xcite .",
    "in this section , we combine the nic2 images and sinfoni emission line data of our six targets to compare the h@xmath6 morphologies and structural parameters with those from the rest - frame optical emission , and determine the contribution from [ oiii ] and h@xmath46 line emission to broad - band @xmath58 flux densities .      for proper comparison of the @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 maps , we first convolved the nic2 images to the spatial resolution of the sinfoni data .",
    "the sinfoni fov is too small to include neighboring stars observed simultaneously with the galaxies , and the psfs are based on the average of broad - band images synthesized from the sinfoni data cubes of stars observed immediately before or after the target .",
    "these non - simultaneous psf calibrations are however estimated to provide good representations of the psf of the targets data , to @xmath263 in terms of the fwhm @xcite .",
    "we computed the smoothing kernels with a lucy - richardson deconvolution algorithm .",
    "curve - of - growth analysis of the convolved nic2 and original sinfoni psfs indicates that the fraction of enclosed flux agrees to better than 5% in circular apertures with diameters in the range @xmath264 in all cases .",
    "after convolution , we resampled the nic2 images to the pixel scale of the sinfoni data where appropriate ( @xmath265 for all sets but the ao @xmath98 data of bx482 ) and aligned them with the emission line maps relying primarily on the outer isophotes",
    ". the detailed emission line and broad - band morphologies can plausibly differ for any galaxy .",
    "however , for our sources , and especially at a seeing - limited resolution of @xmath38 , the overall light distribution turns out to be very similar .",
    "we verified the registration with line - free continuum maps extracted from the sinfoni data cubes for the brighter sources .",
    "in contrast to the line maps , the continuum maps have lower s / n so that mostly only the central brighter regions or the continuum peak are reliable . the alignment based on line and continuum in those cases agrees well within @xmath266 sinfoni pixels .",
    "figures  [ fig - nic_sinf1 ] and [ fig - nic_sinf2 ] show , for each target , the original @xmath58 band image along with the h@xmath6 line map and velocity field with contours of the convolved @xmath58 band image overplotted .",
    "the most detailed comparison is possible for bx482 with ao - assisted sinfoni data .",
    "both the lower surface brightness component and the brighter sub - structure are comparable between the @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 emission .",
    "this similarity is reflected in the nearly equal values of gini , multiplicity , and @xmath5 coefficients from the analysis in ",
    "[ sub - morph ] ( see figure  [ fig - morph1 ] ) . in the details , there are however some noticeable differences .",
    "in particular , a few of the brighter peaks , or clumps , visible in the nic2 or in the h@xmath6 image have no obvious counterparts in the other map .",
    "the properties of the clumps identified in these two images are studied in paper  ii .",
    "the central regions of bx482 also appear to be slightly brighter in @xmath58 band emission than in h@xmath6 emission .    for the other galaxies with lower resolution sinfoni data , the small - scale substructure is smeared out but the overall @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 distributions at @xmath267 resolution are very similar . for bx389 ,",
    "the southern companion that is clearly separated from the main galaxy in the original nic2 image is still apparent at lower resolution as an extension in the outer isophotes .",
    "the well - resolved se and nw merger components of bx528 , and the bridge of emission connecting them , blend together and the psf - matched nic2 image strikingly resembles the fairly regular and centrally concentrated h@xmath6 line map . while in most cases , the general large - scale features of the morphologies are recognizable at @xmath38 resolution , bx528 offers an example where the nature of the system can only be reliably assessed with the additional information from either the kinematics or higher spatial resolution data .",
    "we performed 2d srsic model fits on both the h@xmath6 maps and the psf - matched nic2 images using galfit , following the procedure described in   [ sub - galfit_meth ] . for bx482 , we ran fits on the ao - assisted as well as the seeing - limited h@xmath6 data .",
    "for bx528 and bx389 , we considered only single component fits since , at the @xmath38 resolution of the sinfoni data , the merger components are unresolved in the former case , and the southern companion is blended with the primary galaxy in the latter . for consistency ,",
    "fits on the convolved nic2 images were restricted to a smaller region corresponding to the deepest area with effective @xmath268 fov of the sinfoni data at the @xmath265 scale , and @xmath269 fov of the ao data at @xmath98 for bx482 .",
    "this reduced area potentially affects the sky background estimates , degenerate with the profile shape and half - light radius .",
    "the smaller fov as well as the broader psf both contribute to the significantly larger uncertainties for the fits performed on the lower resolution maps compared to those using the maps at the original nic2 resolution .",
    "table  [ tab - galfitres_smoo ] reports the best - fit structural parameters and figure  [ fig - galfitres3 ] compares the results from h@xmath6 with those from the psf - matched nic2 data .",
    "overall , there is good agreement between the measurements based on the different data sets , with differences almost always within the ( larger ) @xmath206 uncertainties of the results obtained from the lower resolution maps .",
    "bx663 is the most deviant source , with largest offsets in srsic index ( smaller by @xmath270 ) , half - light radius ( smaller by factors of @xmath271 ) , and p.a .",
    "( differences by @xmath272 ) between the lower resolution h@xmath6 and psf - matched @xmath58 band maps and the original resolution @xmath58 band image . on the other hand , the parameters derived from the h@xmath6 and psf - matched @xmath58 maps are in closer agreement , with @xmath273 and @xmath199 for h@xmath6 higher by @xmath274 and 0.3 , respectively , and @xmath200 lower by @xmath157 , all within the @xmath206 uncertainties .",
    "to investigate the cause of the differences in parameters obtained from the original @xmath58 band image of this galaxy and from the smoothed and resampled version , we created a pure @xmath275 srsic model with total magnitude , @xmath194 , @xmath200 , and p.a .",
    "equal to the values of the best fit to the original nic2 map of bx663 .",
    "the mock galaxy was pasted into an empty area of the full nic2 map , which was then convolved to the sinfoni psf , and finally resampled to @xmath40 .",
    "the input parameters are recovered within @xmath276 by the fitting procedure in the @xmath48 data , both at the original nic2 and the lower sinfoni resolution ( with differences of @xmath277 in @xmath194 and @xmath278 in @xmath199 ) .",
    "significantly lower @xmath194 and @xmath199 index are derived after resampling to the larger pixel scale with , however , the best - fit parameters for the mock galaxy in excellent agreement with those of the real psf - matched and resampled @xmath58 band image of bx663 ( within @xmath276 , with @xmath279 difference in @xmath194 and 0.12 in @xmath199 ) .",
    "these tests indicate that the information on the steep inner profile of bx663 leading to @xmath275 is lost with the coarser @xmath40 sampling despite the good @xmath280 resolution of its sinfoni data .    for the other five sources ,",
    "a comparison of the fits to the smoothed and original @xmath58 maps indicates that the half - light radii , srsic indices , and p.a.s agree on average to @xmath281 , 0.1 , and @xmath282 , respectively , with differences among individual galaxies of at most @xmath283 , 0.2 , and @xmath284 .",
    "the axis ratios are higher by @xmath285 on average ( in the range @xmath286 ) for the fits to the smoothed nic2 data . among these five sources , the differences between fits to the @xmath38 resolution h@xmath6 and psf - matched @xmath58 maps are on average @xmath95 for @xmath194 , 0.08 for @xmath199 , and @xmath287 for p.a .",

    ", the differences between the parameters obtained based on the seeing - limited and ao h@xmath6 maps are in the same ranges as for the smoothed versus unsmoothed @xmath58 band maps for the other sources ( excluding bx663 ) .",
    "the close agreement between the parameters derived from the h@xmath6 and @xmath58 band emission for bx482 , either at @xmath291 or @xmath38 resolution , is unsurprising in view of their similar morphologies in the high resolution sinfoni and nic2 data ( figures  [ fig - morph1 ] and [ fig - nic_sinf2 ] ) .",
    "one important implication of the srsic model fits is that the global h@xmath6 and rest - frame @xmath292  light distributions do not differ significantly from each other .",
    "this result is further supported by the comparison of the radial light profiles extracted along ellipses with center , axis ratio , and p.a . from the best - fit model to the @xmath58 band maps in figure  [ fig - profiles2 ] . in this figure , the lower resolution h@xmath6 and psf - matched @xmath58 maps",
    "are used for all sources , except for bx482 where the profiles are extracted from the ao - assisted h@xmath6 data and original @xmath58 band image . at @xmath38 resolution , the h@xmath6 and @xmath58 band profiles follow closely each other , with differences becoming important only beyond @xmath293 or typically @xmath294 .",
    "for the low flux levels reached at these large radii , systematic residuals in background subtraction and flatfielding potentially affect the profiles in a substantial way . at radii @xmath295 , some of the ( small ) discrepancies may reflect differences in the detailed morphologies as well as uncertainties in the exact sinfoni psf and thus the convolution kernel applied to smooth the nic2 data .",
    "for the higher resolution profiles of bx482 , the ring - like feature that is dominated by the very bright clump on the southeast side of the galaxy is prominent in both h@xmath6 and rest - frame @xmath292 ; as seen also from figure  [ fig - nic_sinf2 ] , the regions in the vicinity of the galaxy center are comparatively fainter in h@xmath6 than in @xmath58 band light",

    "the galaxies are sufficiently large that their overall radial light distributions remain well resolved at @xmath38 resolution .",
    "the most noticeable difference is the systematic shift to higher axis ratios for all sources .",
    "the coarser @xmath40 sampling leads to a significant decrease in srsic index for bx663 , the object with steepest inner light profile ( @xmath275 ) at @xmath48 .",

    "for the five sources with @xmath1 .      in view of the similarity between the @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 maps for our targets , it is important to assess the contribution of emission lines to the broad - band emission . at the redshift of our targets ,",
    "the nic2 f160w bandpass includes the [ ] @xmath298 doublet and h@xmath46 .",

    "the [ oiii ] lines are detected in all galaxies but bx663 , while h@xmath46 is detected in md41 and bx610 . some of the non - detections can be attributed to the galaxies lines being redshifted to the wavelength of bright telluric lines ( in particular h@xmath46 for bx663 and bx482 ) . for all non - detections , we derived upper limits on the fluxes .",

    "the largest line contribution is inferred for bx389 , where the [ ] lines make up @xmath299 of the total @xmath58 band flux density and , with the @xmath55 upper limit on h@xmath46 , the total line contribution is estimated at @xmath300 .",
    "bx610 has the smallest contributions , amounting to @xmath301 for all three lines combined .",

    "these gradients in line ratios reflect spatial variations in line excitation or gas - phase oxygen abundance , and in dust extinction across the targets @xcite . to assess possible spatial variations in the emission line contributions",
    ", we also examined the galaxies on a pixel by pixel basis after convolving the nic2 maps to the psfs of the sinfoni @xmath44 band data , resampling them to @xmath265 , and aligning them following the same procedure as for h@xmath6 .",
    "we considered only pixels with @xmath302 in both @xmath58 flux density and line flux ( the summed fluxes over these pixels represent typically @xmath303 of the integrated measurements of the galaxies in 3-diameter apertures ) .",

    "for our nic2 targets , we estimate in paper  ii that the clumps identified in rest - frame optical continuum light contribute individually typically only @xmath421 of the total emission of the host galaxy ; their total contributions range between @xmath422 and @xmath423 ( @xmath74 on average ) , depending on the object . therefore ,",
    "for these six galaxies , the impact of the substructure associated with the clumps , spread across the galaxies , probably does not affect the size measurements in an important way .    as we found in ",
    "[ sub - galfit_res ] , the kinematically identified disks have global radial light profiles that deviate appreciably from pure exponential disks , with best - fit srsic indices @xmath424 , or @xmath425 for the agn source bx663 .",
    "the impact of fitting exponential disks to our nic2 targets is , however , relatively modest .",
    "excluding the major merger bx528 , single - component srsic model fits to the @xmath72 resolution @xmath58 band images with fixed @xmath196 yield the following changes : the effective radii mostly increase , with mean and median @xmath426 , and range of @xmath427 .",

    "our targets have @xmath436 , which places them within the upper half of the full distribution",
    ". the substantial scatter by roughly an order of magnitude in rest - frame optical ( circularized ) effective radius at fixed stellar mass is seen at all redshifts up to @xmath437 and is attributed , at least in part , to the wide range of star formation rates and histories among galaxies .",
    "this scatter as well as the relationships between size , star formation activity , stellar mass , and stellar mass surface density mean that sample properties and selection biases need to be considered for consistent comparisons with other galaxy samples as well as theoretical predictions .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath297  continuum probed by our nic2 data is more sensitive to lower - mass , longer - lived stars making up the bulk of the stellar mass while the h@xmath6 emission is dominated by the young , short - lived stars",
    ". one might expect to be able to discern with these data possible differences between the distributions of stellar mass and of star formation , if any .",
    "for all our sins nic2 galaxies , however , we find very close agreement between the parameters derived from the @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 maps , with on average the same effective radius and srsic index to within @xmath95 and 0.08 , respectively (   [ sub - hamorph_struct ] and figure  [ fig - galfit_comp ] ) .",
    "this similarity in size and global profile shape is probably not due to beam - smearing effects , which we found to be not very significant for our targets based on the @xmath58 band images at the original nic2 resolution and convolved to the typical @xmath38 resolution of the sinfoni data as well as on the seeing - limited and ao - assisted h@xmath6 maps of bx482 .    these results ,",
    "albeit for a small sample , are interesting to consider in the context of models of disk formation , where a signature of `` inside - out '' scenarios for the growth of stellar disks is that the half - mass radius of the recently formed stars , `` @xmath438 , '' is larger than the half - mass radius from the total stellar mass , `` @xmath439 .

    "formally , the uncertainties of individual objects would allow ratios of @xmath448 but the trend of ratios @xmath449 ( with standard deviation of 0.1 ) for the ensemble of our five @xmath0 disks indicates little , if any , systematic difference between the h@xmath6 and rest - frame optical sizes .",
    "we conclude from the considerations above that the size measurements of our sins nic2 targets appear robust against possible biases due to substructure , or to specific assumptions on the light profile as tested with fixed @xmath196 fits to our disks .",
    "we estimated the impact of substructure or of adopting @xmath196 models to all be within typically @xmath450 .",
    "based on the nic2 and sinfoni data of the five disks among our sample , we do not detect a clear effect whereby the distribution of the actively star - forming regions would be characterized by a larger effective radius relative to that of stars tracing more closely the bulk of the stellar mass .",
    "it would be premature to generalize this finding from a small number of galaxies and draw conclusions on the `` inside - out '' scenario of disk formation , but our high quality nic2 and sinfoni data provides a first set of direct empirical constraints at @xmath0 for theoretical models .",
    "the sizes of all our six galaxies , with @xmath451 ( or @xmath452 ) are not surprisingly large when placed in the broader context of the massive @xmath0 galaxy population , taking into account their properties in conjunction with the existing trends of larger sizes at high specific sfr and low stellar mass surface density .",
    "there are several possible caveats to the analysis presented in the previous subsection .",
    "in particular , our simple srsic model fits do not account for multi - component structure . as a specific example , if there is a significant bulge , the @xmath194 from single - component model fits will tend to underestimate the @xmath194 for the disk itself .",
    "the @xmath58 band radial light profiles do not indicate the presence of a significant bulge component in our disks ( figure  [ fig - profiles ] ) , and this is further supported by the low srsic indices and relatively small gini coefficients ( figures  [ fig - galfit_comp ] and [ fig - morph2 ] ) .",
    "the exception may be bx663 but it is unclear whether , and by how much , the agn in this object may contribute to the central emission peak .",
    "the two - component fits for bx663 explored in   [ sub - galfit_res ] imply a very minor fraction of @xmath453 of the total @xmath58 band light for a putative nuclear point source but a more important @xmath454 for a putative bulge . in both cases , however , the @xmath194 of the disk component is not significantly different from that of the best - fit single - component model ( with @xmath275 )",
    ". also , as we determine in paper  ii , the clump closest to the center in each of the other four disks , which could be interpreted as a young bulge , makes a marginal contribution of @xmath455 to the total rest - frame @xmath297  light , and even only @xmath456 for the more prominent central peak of bx663 kinematics of sins disks with high quality sinfoni data , including four of our targets , @xcite found a trend of increasing central dynamical mass concentration with stellar evolutionary stage , which could be interpreted as evidence for growing bulges / inner disks .",
    "the inferred ratio of enclosed dynamical mass within 3  kpc and 10  kpc ranges from @xmath457 for md41 , to 0.2 for bx482 , and 0.4 for bx389 and bx610 .",
    "disentangling the relative contributions of a bulge and the underlying disk from these data is uncertain but these estimates would provide conservative upper limits to bulge - to - disk mass ratios . ] .",
    "it thus appears unlikely that the sizes inferred for the disks in our sins nic2 sample would be significantly affected by the presence of a bulge , neglected in our srsic model fits .",
    "another caveat is that the effects of dust obscuration are ignored .",
    "extinction may significantly modify the surface brightness distributions , and hence the best - fit sizes .",
    "in particular , higher extinction towards the central parts of the sources will lead to shallower observed inner profiles .",
    "for bx610 , our seeing - limited sinfoni @xmath44 and @xmath7 band data are of sufficient s / n to constrain the radial variations of the @xmath458 flux ratio @xcite .",
    "the balmer decrement suggests indeed an increase in visual extinction by @xmath459 in the inner @xmath460 , so that the intrinsic inner light profile could be steeper and the effective radius could be smaller .",
    "moreover , differential extinction towards the regions and the stars could affect the relative rest - frame optical and h@xmath6 effective radii .",
    "the existing data for our nic2 targets do not allow us , however , to constrain on @xmath461 kpc scales the effects of spatial variations in dust extinction and of differential obscuration between the regions and the bulk of the stellar populations .    finally , the depth of the @xmath58 band and h@xmath6 maps may also influence the best - fit srsic model parameters , including the @xmath199 index and @xmath194 .",
    "our sinfoni and nic2 data sets are fairly deep in terms of what can be achieved with these instruments ( see    [ sub - sinfdata ] and [ sub - noise ] ) , and the radial light profiles are traced to @xmath462 ( figures  [ fig - profiles ] and [ fig - profiles2 ] ) . nonetheless , the @xmath55 surface brightness limits correspond to fairly high h@xmath6 and rest - frame @xmath400 band luminosities of @xmath463 and @xmath464 at the median @xmath31 of our nic2 targets , and it is conceivable that fainter extended emission in the outer parts is undetected in our data .      arguably , one of the key aspects in the study of high redshift galaxies is a characterization of the mass assembly process , and , in particular , pinpointing evidence for the occurrence of major mergers and interactions or , in their absence , for the establishment of disk - like systems , which are a prediction of models of galaxy formation .",

    "initially based on qualitative assessment of both the h@xmath6 velocity field and velocity dispersion map @xcite , the classification into disk- and merger - like systems was quantitatively confirmed through the application of kinemetry @xcite , with the exception of bx663 due to s / n limitations outside of the inner regions . to date , bx482 is the only target among our nic2 sample followed - up with ao and the @xmath98 scale , with effective resolution of @xmath49 .",
    "its kinematic classification as a disk is further confirmed with the higher resolution data , although more detail in the h@xmath6 emission and kinematic maps is resolved .",
    "fourteen other galaxies from the full sins survey were classified by kinemetry , of which four have follow - up ao observations at @xmath466 resolution @xcite . in all cases , as for bx482 , the kinematic classification is the same whether it is based on the seeing - limited or the ao data sets .    at first glance , the nic2 @xmath58 images of our six targets at @xmath72 resolution ( @xmath420 ) reveal rich sub - structure at all surface brightness levels .",
    "qualitatively , multiple bright compact components can be interpreted as distinct interacting / merging units , asymmetries in the more diffuse emission or distorted isophotes on large scales can be attributed to tidal features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". it may therefore not be immediately obvious whether a system is a disk or a merger from simple visual inspection .",
    "quantitatively , as found in   [ sub - galfit_res ] , all the kinematically classified disks among our nic2 sample have srsic indices @xmath467 ( and even @xmath468 when excluding the agn source bx663 ) , consistent with structurally late - type , disky systems .    among our nic2 sample",
    ", bx610 appears to be a particularly striking example where the rest - frame optical morphology reflects tell - tale signatures of internal dynamical processes .",
    "indeed , its appearance , as outlined in   [ sub - look ] , exhibits evidence for a bar and features reminiscent of spiral arms , and there is no evidence for any nearby companion in our nic2 and sinfoni data , nor of recent merging .",
    "this galaxy is one of the most robust examples of rotating disk kinematics among the sins survey @xcite , with the h@xmath6 velocity field exhibiting the classical `` spider diagram '' of isovelocity contours , a nearly axisymmetric and centrally peaked velocity dispersion map , and a close correspondence of the kinematic center and major axis with the geometrical center and morphological major axis ( from both the rest - frame optical and h@xmath6 emission ) .",
    "bx610 shows several prominent clumps and direct observations of co molecular gas indicate a very high gas to baryonic mass fraction of @xmath469 @xcite .",
    "all these properties suggest that bx610 may be one such apparently isolated galaxy where clumps formed from fragmentation in a toomre - unstable gas - rich disk and where efficient secular processes drive its early dynamical evolution ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper ii ) show prominent clumps and properties consistent with the above theoretical scenario .",
    "while the majority of objects in our sins nic2 sample are classified as disks , it is noteworthy to highlight examples of how the unique combination of h@xmath6 kinematics and rest - frame optical morphologies sheds light on galaxy interactions . for bx528",
    ", the h@xmath6 kinematics clearly indicate its merger nature even at the @xmath111 seeing - limited resolution of the sinfoni data @xcite .",
    "the reversal in velocity gradient across the system could be produced by a counter - rotating binary merger . in the nic2 image ,",
    "the system is resolved into two main `` se '' and `` nw '' components separated by about 1  ( 8  kpc ) in projection , and connected by a fainter `` bridge '' of emission .",
    "single - component srsic model fits to the @xmath58 map , either at the original nic2 resolution or convolved to the lower resolution of the sinfoni observations , imply a shallow inner light profile with @xmath470 , evidently caused by the lower surface brightness between the se and nw components . as seen in ",
    "[ sub - look ] , at @xmath471 resolution , both the h@xmath6 and smoothed @xmath58 band morphologies appear rather regular and the se and nw components are not discerned , making it impossible to distinguish from disk - like systems .",
    "moreover , bx528 does not stand out compared to the disks in our sample in the @xmath357 parameter space based on the high resolution nic2 image ( figure  [ fig - morph1 ] ) .",
    "thus , for bx528 , both the h@xmath6 kinematics and the high resolution rest - frame optical imaging are necessary to fully characterize the nature of this system .    even if not as significantly as bx528 , bx389 also presents evidence for galaxy interaction ( figure  [ fig - nic_sinf2 ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 kinematics at @xmath472 resolution show fairly regular motions consistent with rotation in a highly inclined disk .",
    "the various line maps from the @xmath7 and @xmath44 band seeing - limited sinfoni data all exhibit an extension to the south of the center , and the rest - frame optical line ratios ( [ ] /h@xmath6 , [ ] /h@xmath46 ) are consistent with either a low - metallicity companion or shock excitation in a starburst - driven galactic outflow @xcite .",
    "this extension does not appear kinematically distinct from the main part of the source , with line - of - sight velocities similar to those along the major axis of the main body of the galaxy , on the same side and at the same projected radii .",
    "the nic2 @xmath58 band imaging reveals that this is a separate component , at a projected distance of 5  kpc below the galactic plane of bx389 , supporting the nearby satellite interpretation . for bx389",
    ", therefore , the high resolution near - ir imaging resolves the companion from the main part of the source and the kinematics confirm the physical association between the two components .    assuming that the observed 1.6  light traces closely the stellar mass in our nic2 targets ( see   [ sub - disc_md41_colmass ] ) , we can set constraints on the mass ratios of the different components in bx528 and bx389 .",
    "various estimates based on the two - component srsic model fits (   [ sub - galfit ] ) , on simple aperture photometry , and on the fractional light contributions of the associated `` clumps '' ( presented in paper ii ) imply a mass ratio in the range 1.2:1 to 1.9:1 for bx528@xmath108se relative to bx528@xmath108nw , and 6:1 to 20:1 for the main part of bx389 relative to the southern companion . from the stellar mass ratio ,",
    "bx528 is a nearly equal - mass major merger , in agreement with the signatures and classification from the h@xmath6 kinematics .",

    "we conclude from the above that the h@xmath6 kinematics and rest - frame optical continuum morphologies of our nic2 sample draw a consistent picture for the nature of each target and are very complementary .",
    "the kinematics , even at @xmath473 resolution , are sufficient ( and in some cases necessary , as for bx528 ) to reliably distinguish between disks and major mergers .",
    "we caution that there will be specific cases where a system s configuration will lead to ambiguous or erroneous classification , also depending on the data quality @xcite , but this does not appear to be the case for the objects studied in this paper .",

    "the sinfoni kinematics for bx389 indicate regular disk rotation , but both sinfoni h@xmath6 maps and nic2 rest - frame optical imaging reveal a low - luminosity companion at roughly the same line - of - sight velocity , and a projected distance of 5  kpc  possibly a minor merger in action .",
    "we use both parametric ( srsic profile ) and non - parametric ( @xmath475 ) methods for characterizing the nic2 morphologies of the sins nic2 sample .",
    "the majority of these objects are characterized by shallow ( @xmath1 ) inner light profiles , with median effective radius of @xmath2 .",
    "significant residuals are found with respect to the model fits for some objects due to the presence of multiple discrete clumps in the surface - brightness distributions , giving rise to an overall irregular appearance .",
    "the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 values for the sample also reflect the clumpy appearance , with significantly higher @xmath5 and @xmath4 values than would be derived for axisymmetric , monolithic , and compact galaxies at similar redshift .",
    "the relatively low @xmath3 values indicate the lack of any single , prominent bulge component .",
    "given the small sample size , and the active levels of ongoing star formation in all of our targets , it is difficult to extract strong trends between morphology and other galaxy properties within the sins nic2 sample .",
    "however , a comparison with other @xmath0 samples selected using a rest - frame optical ( observed @xmath7-band ) or mid - ir ( observed 24 ) limit reveals that our galaxies follow the broader trends of increasing size , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 , and decreasing @xmath199 , @xmath3 , and stellar mass surface density , with increasing specific star formation rate . at the same time , the larger ensemble of galaxies reflects a considerable diversity in structure at fixed stellar mass .",
    "while these trends have been presented in other work using seeing - limited or lower - resolution nic3 images , the sample with adequate resolution for detailed profile fits ( i.e. , nic2 ) is still very small , and our objects represent an extension of the deep @xmath0 nic2 dataset to higher specific star formation rate .    \\4 .",

    "theses choices are relevant because we ultimately combine the derived @xmath399 map with the observed @xmath58 band image ( least affected by extinction and by light from young stars ) to derive the stellar mass map . for our purposes",
    ", we approximated the rest - frame optical luminosity seen through the nic2 f160w filter ( mean wavelength of 1.61 , range with peak - normalized transmission @xmath480 of @xmath481 , corresponding to rest - frame 5080  and @xmath482 , respectively ) with the model predictions through the sdss @xmath400-band filter ( mean wavelength of 4695  and range of @xmath483 ) .",
    "the @xmath400-band is @xmath484  bluer than the rest - frame range probed by our nic2 data , but it is closer in mean wavelength and has larger overlap than the @xmath137 band ( with mean wavelength of 5510  and range of @xmath485 ) . over the entire range of sfhs and ages considered ,",
    "the differences between @xmath408 and @xmath486 ratios are of at most a factor of two , and similarly over the range of extinction assumed .",
    "metallicity has a very minor impact in comparison .",
    "these differences in @xmath399 ratios constitute however extremes as they are for the full range of model parameters .",
    "more realistically , the fairly narrow range in observed @xmath395 colors across md41 suggest only modest variations in age and extinction . with the assumption of ages @xmath487 and",
    "@xmath488 , more consistent with the results from the modeling of the integrated optical to near - ir sed of md41 in   [ sub - sedmod ] , the @xmath408 ratio is @xmath263 lower than the @xmath486 ratio , with little dependence on the assumed sfh . since our nic2 f160w data probe a rest - frame wavelength range intermediate between the @xmath400 and @xmath137 bands , the numbers above represent upper limits on the offset between @xmath408 we use and the actual stellar mass to rest - frame optical luminosity ratio from our data .",
    "figure  [ fig - ihcol_lmlg ] plots the observed @xmath395 colors versus @xmath408 ratios derived from the models for solar metallicity . curves with different colors correspond to different sfhs .",
    "stellar age increases along the curves from blue to red @xmath395 colors , and from low to high @xmath399 ratios .",
    "different line styles are used to plot models with different extinction ( shown for @xmath489 , 1 , 2 , and 3  mag in the figure ) .",
    "the main effect of increasing extinction is to shift the model curves along a direction that is roughly parallel to the age tracks .",
    "the model curves occupy a fairly well defined locus in the observed @xmath395 versus @xmath408 parameter space , reflecting the strong degeneracy between stellar age , extinction , and sfh in these properties .",
    "this degeneracy can be exploited to derive the mean effective @xmath399 ratio for a given observed color , which , multiplied by the observed luminosity , yields a stellar mass estimate without requiring any knowledge about the actual sfh , age , or extinction .",
    "we computed the `` mean '' relationship by taking the average of the minimum and maximum values in @xmath490 over all model curves within equally - spaced bins of width 0.1  mag in @xmath395 colors . by proceeding in this way , we reduced the impact of the discreteness of our grids of sfhs and extinction . over the ranges in colors where models for all sfhs and all ages for a fixed extinction value are represented , the average of the minimum and maximum @xmath490 is very close to the weighted mean over all models , where the weights are obtained from the time span of each model within a given color bin ; the differences are at most 0.08  dex in @xmath490 .",
    "varying the @xmath149 value has little impact since extinction effects are mostly along the relationship .",
    "the mean relationship for solar metallicity is plotted in figure  [ fig - ihcol_lmlg ] ( white - filled circles and thick solid black line ) , with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation of all models within each color bin .",
    "the relationship derived for @xmath146 solar metallicity is also shown for comparison ( grey - filled circles and thin solid black line ) , but is very similar to the one for solar metallicity . for our analysis of md41 , we adopted the @xmath395 versus @xmath490 relationship derived for @xmath477 models .",
    "the standard deviation of the models suggest that the relationship is accurate to 0.15  dex in @xmath490 over the range of observed colors across md41 ( indicated by the shaded histogram in figure  [ fig - ihcol_lmlg ] ) .",
