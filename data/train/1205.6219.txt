    "these two reactions are catalyzed by their respective enzymes called kinase and phosphatase .",
    "biologically , the @xmath0 form of the enzyme is inactive while the @xmath1 form is active .",
    "hence , a change in the concentation of the kinase ( or of the phosphatase ) leads to a change in the activity of the enzyme @xcite .",
    "mathematical modeling of the pdpc kinetics began in the late 1970s @xcite . in 1981 , goldbeter and koshland discovered a surprising result : if both kinase and phosphatase , acting as enzymes for their respective reactions , are operating under a saturated condition , then the change of @xmath2 can be extreme sharp in response to a change in the kinase concentration .",
    "they called this phenomenon zeroth - order ultrasensitivity @xcite . before that work , biochemists had believed a sharp , sigmoidal transition is the signature of only enzyme systems with multiple subunits or monomer with multiple binding sites ; sigmoidal shaped transition is associated with equilibrium cooperativity .",
    "what had not been fully appreciated until recent years is that the pdpc is not a closed equilibrium system , but in fact an open - chemical system @xcite .",
    "there is now a sizable literature on ultrasensitive pdpc and related biochemical reactions .",
    "see @xcite for two very recent reports .",
    "but all the studies , as far as we know , have been limited to the steady state analysis , with the exception of @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports a study of the time - dependent behavior of ultrasensitive pdpc .",
    "we discover that in addition to the sharp transition , the kinetic of ultrasensitive pdpc exhibit a critical slowdown , i.e. , the time to reach steady state tends to infinit when the system approaches the the critical transition point . in a separated study",
    ", we have also discovered that at the critical point of transition , the ultrasensitive pdpc exhibits large fluctuations @xcite .",
    "putting all these together , this is a reminiscent of the critical phenonemon in physics @xcite .",
    "the classical phase transition problems in condensed matter physics , however , are equilibrium phenomena . the ultrasensitivity discussed in the present work is a nonequilibrium phenomenon .",
