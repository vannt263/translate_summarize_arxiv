    "the discovery of accelerated hubble expansion @xcite has presented physics with a profound challenge : to account for a critical universe in which 74% is in the form of ` dark energy ' with an equation of state @xmath1 . aside from the obvious cosmological constant @xmath2 , a variety of models based on ` quintessence ' @xcite and ` k - essence ' @xcite have been put forward ; for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "one characteristic of the afore - mentioned models is the assumption that dark energy is separate and distinct from dark matter which comprises 22% of the universe with @xmath3 , the remaining 4% being ordinary baryonic matter .    a rather different idea , which has been dubbed _ quartessence _",
    "@xcite , is that both dark energy and dark matter are aspects of a unified theory .",
    "the first definite quartessence model @xcite was based upon the chaplygin gas , an exotic fluid obeying @xmath4 , which is equivalent @xcite to the dirac - born - infeld theory for a d - brane : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the brane tension .",
    "this lagrangian yields a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor with the four - velocity @xmath7 @xmath8 , the pressure @xmath9 and the density @xmath10 . solving the @xmath11 field equation in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe gives @xcite @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an integration constant and @xmath14 the scale factor normalized to unity today .",
    "thus one sees that the model interpolates between dust at small @xmath14 and a cosmological constant at large @xmath14 .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that a dominant proportion of the chaplygin gas condensed on caustics of the primordial velocity field to provide dark matter haloes , the residual fraction providing dark energy .",
    "the crucial question is what fraction of the chaplygin gas goes into condensate .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we have noted that if this were 92% as given by the geometric zeldovich approximation , the cmb and the mass power spectrum would be reproduced .",
    "however , our analysis of the nonlinear evolution of the chaplygin gas @xcite demonstrates that the collapse fraction is less than 1% , far too small to significantly affect the mass power spectrum .",
    "this result , in qualitative agreement with that of avelino et al @xcite , is not surprising .",
    "although the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath15 is small at large redshifts , the comoving acoustic horizon @xmath16 already reaches mpc scales at a redshift @xmath17 , so frustrating condensation . in the absence of dominant condensation ,",
    "the chaplygin gas model is in gross conflict with the cosmic microwave background @xcite and the mass power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we note that the generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 for causality , is even less satisfactory because @xmath20 is larger .",
    "it has been noted by reis et al @xcite that the root of the structure formation problem is the term @xmath21 in perturbation equations , equal to @xmath22 for adiabatic perturbations , and if there are entropy perturbations such that @xmath23 , no difficulty arises .",
    "this scenario is difficult to justify in the simple chaplygin gas model . here",
    ", we would like to explore a nonadiabatic scenario in which the constant @xmath0 is promoted to a field . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 and the entropy perturbations needed to make @xmath25 vanish are attributed to the perturbations of @xmath0 . however , we demonstrate that if the kinetic term corresponding to @xmath0 is standard ( or can be made so by a field redefinition ) the entropy perturbation is automatically destroyed on subcausal horizon scales . a nonadiabatic scenario with spatial fluctuations of @xmath0",
    "has recently been discussed . moreover ,",
    "if effectively @xmath26 with @xmath27 to produce acceleration @xcite , then @xmath28 showing that such tachyon models share the clustering behaviour of the generalized chaplygin gas . ]",
    "@xcite in the context of the integrated sachs wolfe effect .",
    "irrespective of its other problems , the chaplygin gas quartessence shares the feature of eternal acceleration with most other models of dark energy .",
    "the models with eternal acceleration such as @xmath2cdm and quintessencecdm possess a future horizon which forbids the construction of a consistent s - matrix based on free asymptotic states @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that a simple extension of the chaplygin gas model yields an end to the accelerating phase and makes this model compatible with the s - matrix description of string theory .",
    "the lagrangian density for the hybrid chaplygin gas is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coupling constant and the constant @xmath31 is introduced to make @xmath32 dimensionless .",
    "that is to say , we have replaced the constant brane tension , or the chaplygin gas constant , by the potential for a quintessence - type field @xmath32 , here taken to be exponential .",
    "however , it is important to stress that , unlike in quintessence models , the field @xmath32 affects both dark energy and dark matter .",
    "hence , dark matter and dark energy remain unified as in the simple chaplygin gas model .",
    "solving the @xmath11 field equation in a flat frw model yields the universe evolution equations in the standard form @xmath33 @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xmath36 for the chaplygin - like component and @xmath37 for the @xmath32 field component .",
    "in addition , the @xmath32 field satisfies the equation of motion @xmath38",
    "to preserve the dustlike behaviour of the chaplygin gas at small @xmath14 , we require @xmath39 to be small in the small @xmath14 regime . in this regime the @xmath32 field equation ( [ eq006 ] ) becomes @xmath40 whence @xmath41 solving ( [ eq007 ] ) with @xmath42 and the initial conditions will quickly redshift to zero .",
    "] @xmath43 yields @xmath44 thus , indeed the scalar @xmath32 will be unimportant until @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    as in the simple chaplygin gas , once accelerated expansion starts near @xmath47",
    ", the quantity @xmath48 is quickly redshifted to zero . for large @xmath14 , @xmath49 , so the hybrid chaplygin gas becomes simple quintessence with an exponential potential . in this large @xmath14 regime",
    "there are simple power law solutions @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 being constants , showing that if @xmath54 , deceleration is obtained , and if @xmath55 , the behaviour is that of dust .",
    "hence , the hybrid model with @xmath54 supports only a transient period of accelerated expansion around @xmath47 .",
    "we have confirmed this by numerical calculation : in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we exhibit the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq006 ] ) , which fits eqs .",
    "( [ eq009 ] ) and ( [ eq010 ] ) well for small and large @xmath14 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the deceleration parameter @xmath56 which briefly goes negative around @xmath47 .",
    "our hybrid model is in spirit similar to the hybrid qintessence of halyo @xcite since the field @xmath32 serves as a trigger field responsible for ending acceleration .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this type of behaviour is preferable from the string theory perspective .",
    "a similar transient acceleration has been obtained in braneworld models of dark energy @xcite , in the two - field supersymmetric hybrid model @xcite , in double quintessence @xcite , in a tachyon scenario @xcite and in a variant of the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .    for the sake of comparison with the concordance model",
    ", we also calculate the magnitude - redshift relation using the definition @xcite @xmath57 where the luminosity distance for the flat space is defined as @xmath58 and @xmath59 is a constant of the order of 25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the results of the calculation in the hybrid chaplygin gas and in the @xmath2cdm model , and compare them with the supernovae type i observation data @xcite .",
    "despite the above encouraging features , this extended model does not solve the structure formation problem .",
    "indeed , the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq002 ] ) is constructed so that @xmath60 and the entropy perturbations of @xcite are realized by @xmath61 as an initial condition outside the causal horizon @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath32 is small and the potential very flat , the problem is that @xmath63 behaves essentially as a free field @xmath64 then , once the perturbations enter the horizon @xmath65 ( but are still outside the acoustic horizon @xmath66 for adiabatic perturbations ) , @xmath63 undergoes rapid damped oscillations , so that the entropy perturbation is destroyed .",
    "this means that entropy perturbations are not automatically preserved except on long , i.e. , superhorizon , wavelengths where the simple chaplygin gas has no problem anyway .",
    "what is wanted for structure formation is a field which avoids the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq012 ] ) ) as the brane embedding in higher dimensions @xcite ] .",
    "a natural candidate that comes to mind @xcite is the kalb - ramond field which is intrinsic to string theory and is coupled to the dirac - born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "related models have recently been considered in the context of d - brane world cosmology @xcite and phantom energy stars @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "we have examined a hybrid model , promoting the chaplygin gas constant to the potential for an extra scalar @xmath32 .",
    "the hybrid model preserves the main successes , and failures , of chaplygin quartessence but has the added feature of future deceleration .",
