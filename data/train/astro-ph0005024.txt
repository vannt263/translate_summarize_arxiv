    "at the very end of 1995 , the discovery  @xcite of the first jupiter - mass ( @xmath4 ) planet orbiting a normal star other than the sun heralded the beginning of a new era of extraordinary discoveries in the realm of extra - solar planets , bringing with them the hope for a better understanding of the formation and frequency of planetary systems , and perhaps of bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of discovering extraterrestrial life .",
    "after four years since that discovery , spectroscopic programs have been able to reveal some twenty extra - solar planets , i.e. , objects with a lower mass limit below the 13-@xmath4 cut - off which has been adopted by oppenheimer and kulkarni   to differentiate giant planets from brown dwarfs .",
    "however , these discoveries have raised new and troubling questions in our understanding of the properties of planetary systems .",
    "the fundamental tenets upon which present theories are based include nearly circular orbits and giant planets formed several au from the central star , in contrast with the very short orbital periods  @xcite and high eccentricities  @xcite found for several of the new discoveries .",
    "their interpretation as _ bona - fide _ planets rests on our understanding of correlations shown by their orbital and physical parameters , as recently discussed by black   and earlier by duquennoy & mayor   in their work on solar - type binary stars .",
    "new models , which employ specific physical and dynamical mechanisms like _ in - situ _",
    "formation  @xcite or orbital migration  @xcite , have been proposed to justify the presence of _ hot jupiters _ around normal stars , demonstrating that the interplay between additional theoretical work and more observational data will be necessary for a continued improvement in our theoretical understanding of how planets form and evolve , and where earth - like planets could eventually be found .    however , simply adding a few tens of additional detections of giant extra - solar planets is not enough . a better understanding of the conditions under which planetary systems form and of their general properties requires large , _ complete _ samples of planets , with useful upper limits on jupiter - mass planets at several au from the central star .",
    "+ ongoing and planned radial velocity surveys  @xcite have started filling significant portions of the relevant parameter space .",
    "searches based on relative astrometry from the ground and in space  @xcite will be an important complement to the spectroscopic work and , probably , the preferred means for establishing the existence of planets around young stars and that of low mass planets down to a few earth masses , as will be the case for sim  @xcite .",
    "hipparcos_-like , space - borne global astrometric mission , which can survey the whole sky to faint magnitudes and with high astrometric accuracy , will enable the monitoring of large ( @xmath5 ) samples of stars , with well understood completeness properties .",
    "this , depending on actual values of planetary frequencies  @xcite , could yield the possibility of making firm measurements of statistical properties of planetary systems . for",
    ", different correlations among orbital parameters ( eccentricity , period or semi - major axis ) and measurable differences in planetary frequency are likely to be generated by diverse planetary formation scenarios ( core accretion and disk instability are the two known to date ) and evolution mechanisms , as well as different formation and evolution processes of the parent star ( binarity , spectral type , metallicity , age ) .",
    "an astrometric mission such as _ gaia _ appears well poised for such a systematic census of planetary systems within @xmath0 200 pc from the sun .",
    "the _ gaia _ concept was originally proposed by lindegren and perryman   as a possible cornerstone  class mission within the horizon 2000 + program of scientific satellites of the european space agency .",
    "this satellite is designed to chart more than one billion objects ( stars , extra - galactic objects , and solar system objects ) on the sky down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath6 .",
    "the targeted final accuracy is @xmath0 10 @xmath7as on positions and parallaxes , and @xmath0 10 /year on proper motions at the reference magnitude of @xmath8 for a g2v star  @xcite , and for a mission life time of 5 years .    in the following sections we show and discuss some relevant results derived from detailed end - to - end simulations of the data acquisition and analysis process for _ gaia _ , which , as we will see , appears capable of discovering jupiter - mass planets around @xmath0 3@xmath9 candidate stars ( including dwarfs earlier than k5 ) .",
    "the simulation code is an adaptation of that used by galligani et al .   for the assessment of the astrometric accuracy of the sphere reconstruction in the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "we generate catalogs of single stars randomly distributed on the sky ; each run produces a sphere of 200 stars . as the satellite observing strategy ( or scanning law ) is most easily described in ecliptic coordinates , positions , proper motions and parallax ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively )",
    "are also given in the same coordinate system .",
    "for the moment , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as well as magnitudes and colors , are drawn from simple distributions which do not represent any specific galaxy model ; in particular , in each run the 200 stars simulated have the _ same _ parallax , total proper motions , magnitudes , and colors .",
    "the satellite is made to sweep the sky in such a way that the spin axis precesses around the sun at a rate of about 6.5 rev / year and with a constant angle of @xmath15 .",
    "stars that at any given time are `` seen '' within a strip @xmath16 wide along the great circle ( gc ) being scanned are considered observed ; a gc is completed in about 2.5 hours .",
    "basic observations , which in principle can easily be derived from the fringe pattern measurements above , are the abscissae along a gc , as _ gaia _ , like _ hipparcos _ , makes very precise measurements in one dimension only .",
    "the mission lifetime is set to 5 years and the scanning law is such that the number of basic observations per star is a function of ecliptic latitude : each given object on the sky is re - observed approximately every month , for a total of @xmath17 one - dimensional position measurements , on average .",
    "the minimum number of observations is @xmath0 30 and occurs for stars at the ecliptic equator .",
    "the position of a star at a given time , as described by the combined effects of parallax and proper motions , is called here _ barycentric _ location and it has been described in euclidean space ( flat lorentzian ) .",
    "general relativistic effects , which will have to be considered in the future ( especially for the case of earth - like planets ) , are not taken into account .",
    "finally , gravitational perturbations ( keplerian motions ) induced by a ( _ single _ ) nearby orbiting mass are added to the barycentric location resulting in the `` true '' _ geometric _ location of a target .",
    "simulated observations are generated by adding the appropriate astrometric noise to the true locations .",
    "the error sources considered in the simulation are discussed below .    as in _ hipparcos",
    "_ , _ gaia _ will have two viewing directions separated by a large angle named base angle ( ba ) .",
    "it is by connecting directions far apart on the sky that the principle of space - borne global astrometry demonstrated by _",
    "hipparcos _ is implemented .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the accuracy with which the ba is known throughout the mission is probably the most important single item within the _ gaia _ concept . at the moment",
    "there are two mature optical designs for the ba .",
    "one configuration feature two telescopes mounted on the same optical bench and pointing along the two different line - of - sights .",
    "the other design uses a beam combiner ( an adaptation of that used on _ hipparcos _ ) which physically materializes the ba and multiplexes the two viewing directions into a single telescope unit ; beam combiner and telescope are bolted to the same bench .",
    "the twin telescopes designed for the first configuration feature an off - axis monolithic primary ( with no central obscuration ) , while the collecting telescope of the latter design is a fizeau interferometer with a baseline of 2.45 m .",
    "the details of the _ gaia _ optical configuration ( see e.g. gilmore et al .  , and references therein ) are not critical to our discussion of photon - driven astrometric errors .",
    "the major difference with our earlier work  @xcite is that both designs feature a significantly increased telescope aperture .",
    "the monolithic configuration has a rectangular primary of 1.7 m by 0.7 m , and each circular aperture of the interferometric option is 0.65 m in diameter .",
    "high - accuracy measurements of the position ( phase ) of the psfs are made directly on the focal plane using ccd detectors ( see next section ) .     !",
    "._photon and total error for a single observation .",
    "this is the combination of @xmath18 8 consecutive field - of - view crossings , for any given direction on the sky , each comprising 20 elementary 1-sec exposures , for a total duration for the single integration of @xmath18 160 sec .",
    "these values strictly apply to the interferometric option discussed in the text and to a g2v star and negligible interstellar absorption ( av = 0 ) .",
    "the pure photon noise values increase by @xmath0 30 % for an a0v star and improve by @xmath0 20 % for a k3v .",
    "more explanations are provided in sections 2.2 - 2.3 _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to obtain a visual indication of the quality of the reconstruction , we then compared the apparent motion of the star with the motion obtained with a single star fit and that obtained by a fit with the fitted parameters for the planet .",
    "figure  [ 47uma ] shows the differences in 47 uma s path on the sphere , when calculated starting from : a ) the true values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , adopted in the simulation ( asterisks , solid line ) ; b ) the values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , obtained after fitting the observations with a single star model ( crosses , dotted line ) ; and c ) the values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and of the orbital parameters derived after fitting the observations with a 10 parameter model reproducing the standard motion plus the keplerian circular motion induced on the observed star by the presence of the planet ( diamonds , dashed line ) .",
    "the annual proper motion of 47 uma is very large , compared to the magnitude of the astrometric signature produced by the gravitational influence of its planetary companion : in ecliptic coordinates , @xmath12 = -0.283 arcsec / year , @xmath13 = 0.152 arcsec / year , while @xmath19 mas for an orbital inclination of @xmath20 .",
    "the top left panel shows the full range of motion of 47 uma over five years ; the looping motion is the parallactic eclipse , and the effect of the planet is essentially undetectable on this scale . in order to see the difference in the residuals , we zoom first on region a marked by a small square in the top left panel",
    ", then we identify in the upper right panel two 1-mas@xmath21 regions ( b and c ) , representing each a 1000x enlargement of a small fraction of the motion ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the true and reconstructed motions are very close , consistent with the @xmath22as single - measurement error of the observations used to derive the orbital parameters , while on this scale the orbit obtained with the single - star assumptions ( dotted ) is clearly very different from the actual motion .",
    "third , we derive the uncertainties in the fitted values of the important physical parameters of the two systems , and especially the companion masses .",
    "we derive the mass from the fitted orbital parameters via the mass function : @xmath23 where again @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the planetary and stellar masses in solar masses , @xmath14 the parallax , @xmath26 the orbital period in years , and @xmath27 the semi - major axis of the parent star , expressed in arcsec .",
    "assuming @xmath28 , we obtain : @xmath29    fitting the simulated observations with a 10 parameter model we can derive estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath30 directly , while @xmath27 can be obtained as a combination of the approximated four thiele - innes elements .",
    "provided that one gets informations about the mass of the primary , for example thanks to spectroscopy , it is possible to calculate @xmath31 .",
    "in our case we have , for simplicity , supposed to know @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be exactly equal to @xmath34 .",
    "tables  [ 47tab ] and  [ 70tab ] show the approximated values of @xmath31 in the two cases , starting from the estimated values of @xmath30 , @xmath14 and @xmath27 obtained during the fit , as function of orbital inclination .",
    "the tables stop at @xmath35 for 47 uma and @xmath36 for 70 vir , taking into consideration the upper limits on their masses found by perryman et al   using _ hipparcos _ data .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ measurements , as a matter of fact , agreed with the stars to be single , as no evident signature greater than the nominal error ( @xmath01 mas ) was revealed .",
    "this implies the following upper limits : @xmath31@xmath37 7 @xmath38 , for 47 uma , @xmath31@xmath37 38 @xmath38 , for 70 vir , which again means , considering the results obtained spectroscopically , choosing a minimum orbital inclination as in the tables . in both cases ,",
    "it is clearly evident the high accuracy with which the relevant orbital parameters and the planet s mass are recovered : thanks to the fact that @xmath39 , the fit to _ gaia _ s simulated observations of 47 uma and 70 vir is very satisfactory ; the rms errors between fitted and nominal values of the various parameters are always well within 10 per cent .",
    "such results confirm that _ gaia _ could reveal itself a very powerful instrument to investigate many of the known candidate planetary systems , with the exception of very short - period systems , such as 51 peg : provided the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficiently high and the period not too short , our simulations show that such systems will be easily detected , and their orbital parameters accurately determined by _ gaia _ , at least if such systems are effectively simple , as the first spectroscopic measurements would suggest . in case the signatures produced can not be interpreted as due to the presence of only one planet , this would introduce many interpretative complications in the signals observed : for planetary systems resembling our own , detection should be little affected and residuals analysis might reveal hints of the influence of the outer planets ( @xmath40 for a saturn - like companion is @xmath0 60 at 10 pc but its period is @xmath0 6 times the mission lifetime ) .",
    "however , reliable orbital fitting would probably be restricted to the main component . on the other hand , multiple orbital fitting to good accuracy should be possible for systems composed of giant planets of comparable mass , orbiting with periods within the interval @xmath00.5 - 5 yr , and yielding astrometric s / n @xmath41 10 , like it would be the case for the two outermost planets of the recently discovered system @xmath42 and  @xcite",
    ".    the capability of detecting and measuring multiple planets with _ gaia _ will become matter of future simulations and system studies .",
    "in this work we have given the first quantitative evaluation of the detectability horizon of single extra - solar giant planets around single normal stars in the neighborhood of our solar system for the global astrometry mission _",
    "gaia_. complete simulations , comprehensive of observations of star - planet systems and successive statistical analysis of the simulated data , have yielded the following results :    * it will be possible to detect more than 50 per cent of all _ jupiter - like _ planets ( orbital period @xmath43 years ) orbiting solar - type stars within 100 pc ; _ jupiter - size _ planets , with shorter orbital periods , will be detectable up to 200 pc , with similar probabilities ; * for _ true sun - jupiter systems _ it will be possible to determine the full set of orbital parameters and to derive accurate estimates of the masses up to distances of order of 50 pc , value which doubles if we consider the range of periods in the vicinity of the mission lifetime ; * simulated observations of a selection of the actually known extra - solar planets , discovered by means of spectroscopic measurements , provide a meaningful estimate of the uncertainty with which masses and orbital elements can be determined for the known star - planet systems and for a substantial fraction of those that will be found within the context of such a global astrometry mission . although preliminary , our results indicate that these systems will be easy to discover and their orbital parameters will be accurately determined with _ gaia _",
    ", except very short - period systems such as 51 peg .",
    "hence , our results indicate that : @xmath44 _ gaia _ would monitor all of the hundreds of thousand f - g - k stars ( i.e. , whose masses are within a factor @xmath0 1.5 that of the sun ) up to a distance of @xmath0 200 pc from the sun , in search for astrometric signatures due to the presence of giant planets ( @xmath45 ) with orbital periods up to jupiter s ; @xmath46 a significant fraction of the detected planets would have the main orbital parameters ( semi - major axis , period , eccentricity , inclination ) measured to better than 30 per cent accuracy .    therefore , the _ gaia _ survey would uniquely complement the expectations from other ongoing and planned spectroscopic and astrometric planet searches , both from ground and in space , thus helping with the creation of the fundamental testing ground on which to measure the validity of actual theoretical models of formation and evolution . _",
    "gaia _ s discovery potential might have significant impact on our knowledge of the distribution laws of the most relevant orbital parameters , and it would contribute to determine the frequency of planetary systems themselves in the solar neighborhood and , by extrapolation , in the whole galaxy .",
    "a vast all - sky astrometric survey would help understand peculiar characteristics of these systems , e.g. , whether giant planets lying in the outer regions are common : such planetary scenarios may be worth further investigation , as , according to present theoretical models , this could indicate presence of low mass planets in the inner regions , possibly in the parent stars habitable zones .",
    "the monitoring of hundreds of thousands stars directly implies the chance to investigate objects belonging to a wide range of spectral types , thus providing the important observational material  @xcite to decide whether giant planets are more likely to form by means of gravitational instability in disks ( once they are found more often around young stars  @xcite ) , or by means of accretion of planetesimals ( once they are found more often around old stars  @xcite ) . the high precision global astrometric measurements will estimate the inclination @xmath47 of the orbital planes for the majority of the presently known planetary systems and for a large fraction of those that will be eventually discovered : it will then be possible to provide unambiguous mass estimations of such dark companions , reducing significantly the uncertainty on the mass range in the transition region from brown dwarfs to giant planets .",
    "we wish to offer our special thanks to m.a.c .",
    "perryman for lending initial impetus and continuing support to this investigation .",
    "over the course of this work , we have benefited from discussions with numerous colleagues , and especially gerry gilmore , david latham , lennart lindegren , robert reasenberg and stuart shaklan .",
    "also , we wish to thank the referee for her / his careful comments which helped us improve the original manuscript .",
