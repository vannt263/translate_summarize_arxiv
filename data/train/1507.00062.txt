    "the lhc8 ( lhc with @xmath5 tev ) era has come to a close and the lhc13 era is underway ! what have we learned from lhc8 ?",
    "the standard model ( sm ) has been spectacularly confirmed in a vast assortment of measurements@xcite . and",
    "most importantly , a very sm - like higgs boson has been revealed with mass @xmath6 gev ( atlas / cms combined)@xcite .",
    "the next major target for lhc is to root out evidence for supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "indeed , it has been declared that if lhc13 does not uncover evidence for susy early within run 2 , then physics will have entered a state of crisis@xcite !",
    "what we have learned from lhc8 is that in generic models such as msugra / cmssm no evidence for susy translates into mass bounds of m_1.3  tev & &  for  m_m _  and + m_1.8  tev & &  for  m_~m _ .",
    "in addition , the rather large value of @xmath7 gev seems to require large radiative corrections to @xmath8 in the mssm@xcite .",
    "the higgs mass can be accommodated with tev - scale top squarks for large trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath9@xcite , or by 10 - 100 tev top squarks in the minimal mixing case@xcite .",
    "naively , these rather high sparticle mass limits seem to conflict with notions of weak scale naturalness which favor sparticles at or around @xmath10 gev , the value of @xmath11 . this has led to some puzzlement as to the emerging little hierarchy :",
    "why is @xmath12 ? it has also led to more detailed examination of what is meant by electroweak naturalness .",
    "the point of contact between susy lagrangian mass parameters ( soft terms and superpotential @xmath13 term ) and hard data occurs in the scalar ( higgs ) potential : in the mssm , it is given by v_higgs = v_tree+v , where the tree level portion is given by v_tree & = & ( m_h_u^2+^2)|h_u^0|^2 + ( m_h_d^2+^2)|h_d^0|^2 + & & -b(h_u^0h_d^0+h.c.)+18(g^2+g^2 ) ( |h_u^0|^2-|h_d^0|^2)^2 and the radiative corrections ( in the effective potential approximation ) by v=_itr((_i_i^)^2 ) , where the sum over @xmath14 runs over all fields that couple to higgs fields , @xmath15 is the _",
    "higgs field dependent _ mass squared matrix ( defined as the second derivative of the tree level lagrangian ) of each of these fields , and the trace is over the internal as well as any spin indices .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions allows one to compute the gauge boson masses in terms of the higgs field vacuum expectation values @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and leads to the well - known condition that = -^2 [ eq : mzs ] , where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms arise from derivatives of @xmath22 evaluated at the potential minimum and @xmath23 .",
    "this minimization condition relates the @xmath24-boson mass scale to the soft susy breaking terms and the superpotential higgsino mass @xmath13 . in most computations of the susy mass spectrum , the weak scale soft terms are determined by renormalization group running from a constrained set of parameters set at some high scale @xmath25 . in gravity - mediation@xcite ,",
    "@xmath25 is usually taken to be @xmath26 gev@xcite .",
    "then the weak scale value of @xmath13 is dialed ( fine - tuned ) so that the measured value of @xmath27 is obtained .",
    "an evaluation of the extent of this fine - tuning is provided by the _",
    "measure @xmath28 which evaluates the largest of the 43 terms on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mzs ] .",
    "if one term on the rhs is @xmath29 , then some other unrelated term will have to be large and of opposite - sign to guarantee that @xmath30 gev .",
    "to avoid such large weak scale tuning , evidently all terms on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mzs ] should be comparable to or less than @xmath31 .",
    "this implies the following@xcite .",
    "the superpotential higgsino mass @xmath32 gev , the closer to @xmath27 the better .",
    "the lower limit @xmath33 gev comes from null searches for chargino pair production at lep2 .",
    "the soft term @xmath34 is radiatively driven to small values @xmath35 at the weak scale .",
    "the radiative corrections @xmath20 are not too large .",
    "the largest of these usually comes from the top - squarks .",
    "each of the terms @xmath36 are minimized by tev - scale highly mixed top squarks , a condition which also lifts @xmath37 up to @xmath38 gev@xcite .",
    "some alternative fine - tuning measures also have been advocated in the literature .    1 .   the usual application of the higgs mass large - log measure @xmath39 where @xmath40 has been challenged@xcite in that it ignores the _ dependent _ term @xmath34 which occurs in the rge .",
    "but the larger @xmath41 becomes , the greater is the cancelling correction to @xmath42@xcite . by appropriately combining dependent terms",
    ", @xmath43 reduces to the same general consequences as @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   alternatively ,",
    "the ellis _",
    "et al._/barbieri - giudice measure@xcite is defined as @xmath44 where the @xmath45 constitute fundamental high scale parameters of the theory .",
    "to evaluate @xmath46 , @xmath31 must be evaluated in terms of fundamental high scale parameters usually taken to be the gut scale soft breaking terms .",
    "the usual application of this measure has been challenged@xcite in that in supergravity theories , the soft terms are _ not independent _ , but are evaluated as multiples of the fundamental gravitino mass @xmath47 . evaluating @xmath46 in terms of the _ independent _ parameters @xmath13 and @xmath47 , low @xmath46 also leads to the same general consequences as @xmath28 .    using @xmath28 ,",
    "then indeed most constrained high scale susy models are found to be highly tuned in the ew sector@xcite .",
    "an exception occurs for a pocket of parameter space of the two - extra parameter non - universal higgs models@xcite where @xmath32 gev and where @xmath34 is driven to small negative values comparable to @xmath48 while allowing for highly mixed tev - scale top squarks which provide @xmath7 gev .",
    "this pocket of parameter space we call susy with radiatively - driven naturalness , or rns for short . by requiring ew naturalness , then upper bounds can be computed for all sparticle masses@xcite . in radiative natural susy with @xmath49",
    "then it is found that@xcite :    @xmath50 tev ,    @xmath51 tev ,    @xmath52 gev .",
    "the first of these values can be compared to the ultimate reach of lhc14 with 1000 fb@xmath53 where a @xmath54 discovery can be established for @xmath55 tev@xcite .",
    "thus , while ew naturalness certainly allows for gluinos and squarks to lie well beyond the ultimate reach of lhc13 , it is also true that the _ most _ natural values of gluino and squark masses are those within the exploratory range of lhc13 : the lighter the better .",
    "this motivates an examination of how a susy discovery via gluino pair production is likely to unfold at lhc13 when the gluino mass lies just beyond present bounds .    in this paper",
    "we assume a gluino mass of @xmath56 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ just beyond present bounds . we then investigate how a susy discovery would unfold under three lightest susy particle ( lsp ) archetype scenarios :    the msugra / cmssm model with a bino - like lsp ,    a charged susy breaking ( csb ) scenario with a wino - like lsp and    susy with radiatively - driven naturalness and a higgsino - like lsp .",
    "our goal is to look for commonalities and differences between these three archetype scenarios that would allow a rapid determination of the nature of the lsp if a gluino pair production signal emerges at lhc13 .    towards this end , in sec .",

    ", the model would be distinguished by the presence of one or more _",

    "the mass edge occurs at the kinematic limit @xmath58 gev in rns models . for the msugra benchmark ,",
    "neither of the above distinctive features should develop , but instead the usual multi - lepton plus multijet + @xmath4 cascade decay topologies should build up as greater integrated luminosity accrues .",
