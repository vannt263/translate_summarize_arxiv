    "in strongly correlated electron materials , the coulomb interaction is often larger than the kinetic energy , leading to localization of electrons , or a mott insulator .",
    "it has been argued that being in the vicinity of a mott metal - insulator transition is responsible for many emergent phenomena , such as magnetic quantum phase transitions and superconductivity in heavy fermion systems ,  @xcite iron - based superconductors ,  @xcite and cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite studies from the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and its extensions provide insights into the mott transition from the kondo dynamics in the anderson impurity ( cluster ) model as mapped from the lattice model .",
    "@xcite a metallic state with non - interacting electron behavior , is associated with the strong - coupling kondo fixed point : hopping processes involving double occupancy at one lattice site are allowed through the formation of kondo singlets . when the kondo fixed point is prevented at low energies ( also dubbed as `` kondo - breakdown '' ) , the electrons are therefore localized to form an insulator . however , in the original single - site dmft implementation of the hubbard model , the paramagnetic insulator solution carries an extensive entropy from unscreened local moments , and the single - particle excitation has a sharp excitation gap between lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "when inter - site coupling is incorporated , e.g. , in cluster dmft calculations , the unscreened local moments can reduce entropy by forming intersite spin singlets .",
    "a pseudogap - type of spectrum , with finite single - particle excitations between the lower and upper hubbard bands but suppressed near the fermi energy , is typically identified .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been shown that the pseudogap is associated with singularities in self - energies of interacting electrons .",
    "@xcite these singularities could form a luttinger surface where the green s function @xmath3 changes sign by @xmath4 , in contrast with the regular fermi surface where @xmath3 changes sign by @xmath5 .    in this paper ,",
    "we study an origin of the singularity in self - energies ( and a pseudogap state ) associated with the emergent coherent fermionic excitations in terms of a composite fermion operator @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the regular fermion operator for an interacting electron at a given site @xmath7 with spin @xmath8 , and @xmath2 is the number operator of electrons with the opposite spin . as we show , to introduce this composite fermion is necessary for interacting electrons , as the single - particle excitations behave differently when the lattice site is already single - occupied or vacant , which can be characterized by two operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite while @xmath1 is the `` bonding '' combination of these two types of excitations , @xmath11 , the `` anti - bonding '' counterpart , @xmath12 , is @xmath13 .",

    "we examine the spectral function of this composite fermion operator in the two - impurity anderson model ,  @xcite which is solved _ exactly _ by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method .",
    "@xcite this model is not only relevant to the setting of double quantum dots connected to metallic leads , but also can be mapped from a lattice model , such as the hubbard model or periodical anderson lattice model , with a two - site cluster dmft approach .",
    "it captures the `` kondo - breakdown '' physics of lattice systems due to the competition between local quantum fluctuations such as kondo dynamics , and short - range spatial fluctuations , such as the inter - site spin or change correlations . with the advantages of the nrg method in its low - energy resolution and its dealing with real frequencies directly , we obtain also an accurate form for self - energies over the entire energy range for a model with both local and nonlocal interactions .",
    "we show that the self - energy for anderson orbitals becomes singular ( with a pole ) near the fermi energy in the regime dominated by the inter - site spin exchange interaction [ ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction ] where the kondo fixed point is prevented .",
    "we further discover that instead of exhibiting unscreened local moments behavior , the anderson orbitals develop a collective excitation mode in terms of the composite fermion @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , we find that in the kondo resonance regime dominated by onsite kondo coupling , with a kondo resonance peak in @xmath1 , the spectral functions of @xmath13 have a pseudogap ; in the regime dominated by rkky interaction , where there is a pseudogap in excitations of @xmath1 , the excitations of @xmath13 have a `` resonance''-type spectrum .",
    "we argue that @xmath13 , as a canonical fermion , could develop a fermi surface but `` hidden '' from charge excitations .",
    "the scattering off this composite fermion excitation mode leads to a pseudogap ( or singularity in self - energy ) of @xmath1 .",

    ", this is due to the intersite spin - exchange coupling , as a `` cutoff '' on the kondo renormalization .",
    "@xcite compared with the traditional understandings of this problem , the introduction of the composite fermions may bring the following technical and conceptual advantages .",
    "the composite fermion is a canonical fermion and by definition , it is a directly calculable quantity , at least in numerics .",
    "coherent modes of composite fermions provide a direct characterization of the `` kondo - breakdown '' state .",
    "it shows that not _ all _ fermionic excitations are gapped and naturally explains the fermi - liquid behaviors of the spin and charge susceptibilities in the rkky dominated regime @xmath220 .",

    "[ sec : pair ] , we show that both the regular fermions and composite fermions have finite spectral weights in the quantum critical regime , but their weights are only the half of those in the kondo resonance regime or the rkky dominated regime , correspondingly . we also show that the spectral weight for pair excitations ( in an intersite spin - singlet configuration ) is finite if and only if the spectral weights for both the regular fermions and composite fermions are finite .    our calculations have established that the composite fermions have coherent excitations in the `` kondo - breakdown '' state of the two - impurity anderson model . an important question arises as to whether the concept of composite fermions can be generalized to the mott - insulating states in lattice systems . we notice that in the hubbard model or the anderson lattice model , the interaction effects due to the onsite coulomb interaction can be _ fully _ incorporated in `` hybridization '' between regular fermions and composite fermions , @xmath221 , where @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",

    "@xcite it will be interesting to calculate the spectral functions of the composite fermion operator directly in these calculations to make the connection .",

    "even if there are coherent excitations or a `` fermi surface '' of composite fermions , we expect that these excitations are not detectable or `` hidden '' from conventional spectra measurements .",
    "the reason is that the composite fermion operator is orthogonal to regular fermion operators .",
