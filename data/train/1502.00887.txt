    "experimental studies of neutrino - nucleus interactions carried out over the past decade @xcite have provided ample evidence of the inadequacy of the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm ) , routinely employed in event generators , to account for both the complexity of nuclear dynamics and the variety of reaction mechanisms  other than single nucleon knock out  contributing to the observed cross section .",
    "a striking manifestation of the above problem is the large discrepancy between the predictions of monte carlo simulations and the double differential charged current ( cc ) quasi elastic ( qe ) cross section measured by the miniboone collaboration using a carbon target @xcite .    as pointed out by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , improving the treatment of nuclear effects , which turns out to be one of the main sources of systematic uncertainty in the oscillation analysis @xcite , will require the development of a _ comprehensive _ and _ consistent _ description of neutrino - nucleus interactions , _ validated _ through extensive comparison to the large body of electron - nucleus scattering data @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty involved in the generalisation of the approaches successfully employed to study electron scattering to the case of neutrino interactions stems from the fact that , while the energy of the electron beam is fixed , in neutrino scattering the measured cross section results from the average over different beam energies , broadly distributed according to a flux @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the energy of the outgoing charged lepton in a cc qe interaction _ does not _ specify the energy transfer to the nuclear target , which largely determines the reaction mechanism . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the miniboone double differential cross section corresponding to a specific muon energy bin turns out to receive comparable contributions from different mechanisms , which must be all taken into account in a consistent fashion .",
    "many authors have suggested that the excess cc qe cross section observed by the miniboone collaboration is to be ascribed to the occurrence of events with two particle - two hole final states , not taken into account by the rfgm employed for data analysis @xcite .",
    "the description of these processes within a realistic model of nuclear dynamics requires that all mechanisms leading to their occurrence ",
    "initial state correlations ( isc ) among nucleons in the target nucleus , final state correlations ( fsc ) between the struck nucleon and the spectator particles , and interactions involving two - nucleon meson - exchange currents ( mec)be included . within the independent particle model ( ipm ) of the nucleus",
    ", however , correlations are not taken into account , and two particle - two hole final states can only be excited through the action of two - body operators , such as those involved in the definition of mec .    in this paper , we analyse the mechanisms leading to the appearance of two particle - two hole final states in the response of interacting many - body systems , and argue that the interference between amplitudes involving one- and two - nucleon currents plays an important role .",
    "this feature clearly emerges from the results of a calculation of the transverse electromagnetic response of @xmath1he and of the corresponding sum rule of @xmath2c , computed using state - of - the - art models of the nuclear hamiltonian and currents , within the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) computational scheme @xcite .    in view of the extension of our study to the kinematical regime",
    "in which the non relativistic approximation is no longer applicable , we also outline a novel approach , based on a generalisation of the factorisation _ ansatz _ , underlying the spectral function formalism .",
    "this scheme , allowing for a consistent treatment of one- and two - nucleon current contributions , appears to be quite promising for applications to neutrino scattering .",
    "the structure of the nuclear cross section , as well as its expression in terms of longitudinal and transverse structure functions , are reviewed in section  [ response ] , while section  [ nmbt ] describes the theoretical approaches , based on nuclear many - body theory , developed to study electron - nucleus scattering . in section  [ nonrel ]",
    "we discuss the non relativistic regime and the results of gfmc calculations , while in sections  [ rel ] and [ rel2 ] we derive the explicit expression of the two particle - two hole contribution to the cross section obtained from our approach , and discuss the preliminary results of its application .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] we summarise our findings and state the conclusions .",
    "in the one - photon - exchange approximation , the double differential electron - nucleus cross section can be written in the form [ xsec ] = l_w_a^  , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the four - momenta of the incoming and outgoing electrons , respectively , @xmath5 is the fine structure constant , @xmath6 is the differential solid angle in the direction specified by @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the four momentum transfer .",
    "the lepton tensor @xmath9 is completely determined by lepton kinematics , while the nuclear response is described by the tensor @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the initial and final hadronic states , the four - momenta of which are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the nuclear current can be written as a sum of one- and two - nucleon contributions , according to ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) [ nuclear : current ] j_a^= _",
    "i j^_i+_j > i j^_ij  .",
    "the current @xmath16 describes interactions involving a single nucleon . in the qe sector , it can be expressed in terms of the measured vector form factors @xcite .",
    "the two - nucleon contribution @xmath17 , on the other hand , accounts for processes in which the beam particle couples to the currents arising from meson exchange between two interacting nucleons .",
    "equation can be rewritten in terms of two response functions , denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 , describing interactions with longitudinally ( l ) and transversely ( t ) polarised photons , respectively .",
    "the resulting expression reads @xmath20 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 ^ 2 $ ] is the mott cross section .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 structure functions can be readily expressed in terms of the components of the response tensor of eq . .",
    "choosing the @xmath25-axis along the direction of the momentum transfer one finds @xmath26    note that the above expressions are completely general , and describe processes involving both one- and two - nucleon current operators .",
    "+ it follows from eqs . and that the nuclear cross section and response functions can be written as a sum of contributions corresponding to different hadronic final states @xmath27 .",
    "consider , for example , the case of qe scattering , in which the final state particles are nucleons only .",
    "for a carbon target we find latexmath:[\\ ] ]    extensive numerical calculations of the electron - carbon cross section based on the formalism described in this paper are under way .",
    "however , they involve a number of non trivial novel developments , e.g. the derivation of the two - hole contributions to the nuclear spectral function , the discussion of which will require a separate publication .",
    "figure [ rt_12c ] shows the transverse electromagnetic response of carbon at @xmath125 mev computed using the carbon spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite and approximating the two - hole spectral function of carbon with that of uniform nuclear matter , at density corresponding to fermi momentum @xmath126 mev .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the same as working within the fermi gas model .",
    "we use overlaps  the functions @xmath120 defined by eqs .   and obtained within the _ ab initio _ approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , based on a realistic nuclear hamiltonian including two- and three- nucleon interactions . owing to short range correlations , which move strength from the 1p1h to the 2p2h sector , the resulting occupation of the momentum eigenstates is reduced by @xmath127 20% .",
    "interactions effects also affect the initial state energies of the knocked - out nucleons @xcite , thus shifting the threshold of the two - nucleon current contributions with respect to the predictions of the frmi gas model @xcite .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the correlation contribution to the carbon spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite is obtained from nuclear matter results .",
    "therefore , the use of nuclear matter overlaps in the matrix elements of the two - nucleon current entering the interference terms appears to be consistent .",
    "we have used the fully relativistic expression of the two - nucleon current described in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the same form factors and @xmath128-width .    the solid line of fig",
    ".  [ rt_12c ] represents the results of the full calculation , whereas the dashed line has been obtained including only the amplitudes involving the one - body current .",
    "the contributions arising from the two - nucleon current are illustrated by the dash - dot and dotted lines , corresponding to the pure two - body current transition probability and the interference term , respectively .",
    "the latter turns out to be sizable , its contribution being comparable to the total two - body current response for @xmath129 mev . although our results still need to be improved , and do not include the corrections taking into account the effects of fsi , in fig .",
    "[ rt_12c ] we have also included , for comparison , the data resulting from the analysis of ref .",

    "the solid line represents the results of the full calculation , whereas the dashed line has been obtained including only amplitudes involving the one - body current .",
    "the contributions arising from the two - nucleon current are illustrated by the dot - dash and dotted lines , corresponding to the pure two - body current transition probability and the interference term , respectively .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "we have analysed the mechanisms  correlations in the initial and final states and coupling to meson exchange currents  leading to the excitation of 2p2h final states in the nuclear response to electromagnetic interactions . in the non relativistic regime ,",
    "in which highly accurate calculations consistently taking into account all these mechanisms are feasible , our results confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the transverse channel ,",
    "the contribution of processes involving the two - nucleon current is sizeable , and extends well into the kinematical region corresponding to energy transfer @xmath130 , in which single nucleon knock out is dominant .",
    "the important role played by interference between the amplitudes involving one- and two- body currents clearly implies that correlation effects must be included in any model aimed at describing the nuclear cross section in the 2p2h sector .",
    "this point was clearly stated , over three decades ago , in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors of which also remarked the inadequacy of the treatment of correlations based on lowest - order perturbative pion exchange .",
    "however , combining a realistic and consistent description of correlations and meson - exchange currents in the kinematical region in which the non relativistic approximation is no longer applicable involves serious difficulties .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have developed a novel approach based on the factorisation _",
    "ansatz _ underlying the spectral function formalism , widely and successfully employed to describe the nuclear response in the 1p1h sector . the preliminary results obtained within this approach , shown in fig .",
    "[ rt_12c ] , provide a fairly good description of the measured transverse response of carbon at @xmath125 mev .    a comparison between the results of fig . [ rt_12c ] and the gfmc results of fig .",
    "[ 4he ] shows distinctive discrepancies in both magnitude and energy dependence of the two - body current contributions . while part of the disagreement is likely to originate from differences in the two - nucleon currents employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as from the non relativistic nature of the gfmc calculations , the large interference contribution in the region of the quasi elastic peak observed in fig .",
    "[ 4he ] may arise from interference between amplitudes involving the one- and two - body currents and 1p1h final states . a careful analysis of these terms , that were found to be sizable in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , is being carried out , and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the main assumption implied in the factorisation of the 2p2h final states is the treatment of the knocked out nucleons as free particles , which amounts to neglecting their interactions , both among themselves and with the spectator nucleons .",
    "antisymmetrization under exchange between any of the outgoing particles and the spectators is also disregarded .",
    "the factorized nuclear transition amplitudes involving the one - nucleon current can be corrected  to include the effects of final state interactions in the quasi elastic sector  using an extension of the spectral function formalism , as discussed in ref .",
    "the resulting modifications lead to ( i ) a shift in energy transfer of the differential cross section , arising from interactions between the knocked out nucleon and the mean field of the recoiling nucleus , and ( ii ) a redistribution of the strength from the quasi free peak to the tails , resulting from rescattering processes .",
    "theoretical studies of electron - nucleus scattering suggest that in the kinematical region relevant to the miniboone analysis the former mechanism  which does not involve the appearance of 2p2h final states  provides the dominant contribution , and can be taken into account through an optical potential @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the factorized amplitudes involving the two - nucleon current also include interactions between the two knocked out particles . a careful analysis of these processes is certainly needed .",
    "however , the results of shen et al , who carried out an accurate calculation of the neutrino - deuteron cross section over a broad kinematical range , suggests that their effect becomes negligibly small at beam energies larger than @xmath131 mev @xcite .    in conclusion , we believe that the approach described in this paper provide a viable and promising scheme for the development of a unified treatment of processes involving one- and two - nucleon currents , applicable in the kinematical region relevant to neutrino oscillation searches .",
    "therefore , it may in fact be regarded as a step towards the _ new paradigm _ advocated by the authors of refs .",
