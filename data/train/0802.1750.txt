    "examples of excitable media are frequently found in biological and chemical systems .",
    "prominent examples are cardiac and neural tissue @xcite , slime mold colonies in a starving environment @xcite and intracellular calcium waves @xcite .",
    "there are two defining features of excitable media which are crucial to enable effective signal transmission in biological systems such as cardiac or neural tissue : threshold behaviour and relaxation to a stable rest state .",
    "the threshold behaviour assures that only for large enough stimuli a signal is produced whereas small perturbation decay immediately . for super - threshold perturbations",
    "a signal will decay only after a long excursion  called action potential in the context of cardiac dynamics  back to its stable rest state .",
    "this relaxation allows for repeated stimulation which is essential for wave propagation in cardiac and neural tissue .",
    "+ typical solutions in one - dimensional excitable media are wave trains",
    ". the wavelength @xmath0 can range from @xmath1 corresponding to an isolated pulse to a minimal value @xmath2 below which propagation fails . besides wave trains rotating spiral waves may form in two dimensional excitable media , and scroll waves in three dimensional excitable media @xcite . in the context of cardiac excitable media propagation failure of these solutions",
    "is often linked to clinical situations .",
    "in particular the break - up of spiral waves has been associated with pathological cardiac arrhythmias @xcite .",
    "spiral waves may be created in cardiac tissue when wave trains propagate through inhomogeneities of the cardiac tissue .",
    "a reentrant spiral may move around an anatomical obstacle or around a region of partially or totally inexcitable tissue .",
    "once created they drive the heart at a rate much faster than normal sinus rhythm and cause tachycardia .",
    "if these spiral waves then subsequently breakup into multiple drifting and meandering spirals and disintegrate into a disorganized state , fibrillation may occur with a possible fatal result for the patient , especially when occurring in the ventricles .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to understand the transition from one reentrant spiral to the disorganized collection of complex reentrant pathways . rather than investigating the full two - dimensional problem of spiral wave break - up which would include interactions of numerous wave arms",
    ", one can study some aspects of spiral wave breakup by looking at a one - dimensional slice of a spiral i.e. at a one - dimensional wave train @xcite .",
    "a pulse circulating around a one - dimensional ring constitutes the simplest model for a spiral rotating around an anatomical obstacle .",
    "such models concentrate solely on the dynamics close to the anatomical obstacle and ignore the influence of the dynamics of the spiral arms .",
    "+ experimentally this problem has been studied since the beginning of the last century . in @xcite",
    "the circulation of an electrical pulse around a ring - shaped piece of atrial cardiac tissue from a tortoise heart was investigated as a model for reentrant activity .",
    "recently , the experiments in @xcite investigated the dynamics of pulse circulation around a ring - shaped piece of myocardial tissue from a dog heart . remarkably , it was found that oscillations of the circulation period of the pulse occurred leading to conduction block and subsequent termination of reentry .",
    "+ this indicates that a one - dimensional oscillatory instability , named alternans , may be the mechanism triggering spiral wave breakup @xcite .",
    "this instability occurs when the circulation time of the pulse around the ring is below a certain specific threshold . below this",
    "threshold alternans arise and action potential durations are alternating periodically between short and long periods .",
    "we make here the distinction between alternans which are mediated by external periodic stimulations @xcite and alternans which have a purely dynamical origin .",
    "we call the latter ones _ dynamical alternans_. it is these dynamical alternans with which this paper is concerned with",
    ". we will analyze dynamical alternans using a normal form proposed in @xcite for travelling waves in one - dimensional excitable media .",
    "the stability of dynamical alternans will be determined by a center manifold theory and by multiple scale analysis .",
    "typically oscillatory instabilities arise in one - dimensional media via hopf bifurcations .",
    "these hopf bifurcations may be supercritical resulting in sustained stable oscillations or subcritical leading to a collapse of the oscillations and possibly of the pulse solution .",
    "alternans are widely believed to originate via a supercritical bifurcation @xcite .",
    "this believe is based on numerical simulations of certain models for cardiac dynamics .",
    "however we note that the above mentioned experiments @xcite show that the occurrence of oscillations leads to a subsequent termination of the pulse , which is not suggestive of a supercritical bifurcation . +",
    "our main result for a single pulse and for a wave train in a ring is that in the framework of our normal form alternans arise as a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "this result is in contrast to the common belief that alternans are stable oscillations .",
    "we corroborate our result by numerical simulations of a model for cardiac tissue in which previous numerical simulations suggested the occurrence of stable oscillations .",
    "we will see that previous numerical experiments have not been performed sufficiently long to reveal the subcritical character of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "the subcritical character is in agreement with the above mentioned experiments @xcite and may explain why alternans often trigger spiral wave breakup and are associated with cardiac failures .",
    "the normal form describes excitable media in parameter regions where the system is close to the saddle - node of the travelling wave .",
    "this is the case for models such as the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite , and is typically the case when the hopf bifurcation occurs close to the saddle - node bifurcation of the isolated pulse .",
    "in particular the normal form is valid for those classes of excitable media ( or parameter regions of a particular excitable medium ) where the activator weakly interacts with the preceding inhibitor which exponentially decays towards the homogeneous rest state .",
    "however for other models such as the model by echebarria and karma @xcite there exist parameter regions where upon decreasing the length of the ring the pulse solution is driven away from the solitary pulse solution and does not weakly interact with the inhibitor .",
    "our normal form can not describe these oscillations and we present numerical simulations where oscillations are indeed stable in section  [ sec - numerics ] .",
    "+ recently we have constructed a normal form for travelling waves in one - dimensional excitable media which takes the form of a delay differential equation @xcite ( see ( [ nf ] ) and ( [ nf2 ] ) ) .",
    "the construction is based on the well - known observation that the interaction of a pulse with the inhibitor of the preceding pulse modifies the generic saddle - node bifurcation of an isolated pulse . in fig .",
    "[ fig - barkley2 ] we illustrate this scenario for a modified barkley model @xcite",
    ".    the normal form exhibits a rich bifurcation behaviour which we could verify by numerically simulating partial differential equation models of excitable media . besides the",
    "well known saddle - node bifurcations for isolated pulses and for periodic wave trains the normal form also exhibits a hopf bifurcation and a symmetry breaking , spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "moreover , the normal form shows that the saddle - node and the hopf bifurcation are an unfolding of a bogdanov - takens point as previously suggested in @xcite .",
    "the hopf bifurcation is found to occur before the saddle - node bifurcation for a single pulse in a ring .",
    "for a wave train consisting of several pulses in a ring , the hopf- and the saddle - node bifurcations occur after the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation in which every second pulse dies .",
    "we could verify these scenarios in numerical simulations of a modified barkley - model @xcite and the fitzhugh - nagumo equations @xcite .",
    "the normal form provides a unified framework to study all possible bifurcations of travelling waves in one - dimensional excitable media .",
    "+ we were able to determine the parameters of the normal form from numerical simulations of the modified barkley model @xcite . using these numerically determined parameters we showed excellent agreement between the normal form and the full partial differential equation .",
    "we quantitatively described the hopf bifurcation and the inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation with the normal form .",
    "moreover , we were able to quantify the bogdanov - takens bifurcation .",
    "+ whereas the subcritical character of the pitchfork bifurcation had been established in @xcite , a detailed analysis of the hopf bifurcation was missing .",
    "for example , an interesting question is whether the hopf bifurcation is sub - critical ( as numerically observed for the parameters chosen in @xcite for the modified barkley model ) , or whether it is possible to observe sustained stable oscillations .",
    "this has important implications for cardiac alternans as described above . in this paper",
    "we will analyze the hopf bifurcation of the normal form in detail .",
    "we derive a normal form for the hopf bifurcation which allows us to determine the stability of the bifurcating solutions close to criticality .",
    "+ before we embark on the analytical investigation of the hopf bifurcation and the implications for cardiac dynamics , we state that all conclusions drawn obviously depend on the validity of the normal form . so far the proposed normal form which we briefly review in section  [ sec - nf ] has not been rigorously derived for any excitable medium .",
    "however , we point out that in @xcite we have shown good quantitative agreement with some real excitable media",
    ". we will discuss the limitations of our approach in more detail in section  [ sec - disc ] .",
    "+ in section  [ sec - nf ] we recall the normal form and some of its properties . in section  [ sec - bifhopf ]",
    "we perform a center manifold reduction of the normal form to describe the character of the hopf bifurcation for a single pulse in a ring . in section  [ sec - cgl ]",
    "we look at the case where a pseudo continuum of modes undergo a hopf bifurcation and derive in a multiple scale analysis a ginzburg - landau equation which allows us to study the stability of the hopf bifurcation of a wave train .",
    "the paper concludes with section  [ sec - disc ] where we present results from numerical simulations , discuss the implications of our analysis to cardiac dynamics and make connections to previous studies on alternans .",
    "in particular , we show that our condition for the onset of the hopf bifurcation coincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a normal form for a single pulse on a periodic domain with length @xmath0 @xmath3 where @xmath4 for positive @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 may be for example the difference of the amplitude or the velocity of a pulse to its respective value at the saddle - node .",

    ", we showed that it was sufficient to consider two alternating populations of pulses @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we derived the following extension @xmath17 to avoid confusion we state that we use the term _ normal form _ here in two different contexts .",
    "equations ( [ nf ] ) and ( [ nf2 ] ) are coined `` normal form '' as they are an attempt to describe the behaviour of travelling waves in generic one - dimensional excitable media . however , these normal forms exhibit a rather rich bifurcation behaviour",
    ". we will focus in section  [ sec - bifhopf ] on the solution behaviour close to criticality . in that context",

    "this implies @xmath20 , indicating that the saddle - node of a single pulse or of a periodic wave train on a finite ring occurs at smaller values of the bifurcation parameter @xmath21 than for the isolated pulse .",
    "hence , the bifurcation is shifted to the left when compared to the isolated pulse ( see figure  [ fig - hopfsketch ] ) .",
    "+ besides this stationary saddle node bifurcation the normal form ( [ nf ] ) also contains a hopf bifurcation .",
    "linearization of the normal form around the homogeneous solution @xmath22 with respect to small perturbations of the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 yields @xmath25 besides the stationary saddle - node bifurcation ( [ sn_wt ] ) with @xmath26 , the linearization ( [ lin ] ) also reveals the existence of a hopf bifurcation with @xmath27 .",
    "we readily find from ( [ lin ] ) @xmath28 the first equation ( [ homhopfa ] ) allows us to formulate a necessary condition for the existence for a hopf bifurcation @xmath29 i.e. if the coupling is strong enough and the pulse feels the presence of the inhibitor of the preceding pulse sufficiently strongly .",
    "the hopf bifurcation occurs in parameter space before the saddle - node bifurcation and bifurcates from the upper stable branch @xmath30 of ( [ statio ] ) as is readily seen by observing @xmath31 , independent of the value of @xmath5 .",

    "we show a schematic bifurcation diagram with the saddle - node bifurcation and the subcritical hopf bifurcation for a single pulse in a ring .",
    "when a group of several pulses in a ring is numerically simulated one observes that this wave train group does not undergo a symmetry preserving hopf bifurcation on increasing the refractoriness , but instead develops a symmetry breaking , spatially inhomogeneous instability whereby every second pulse dies .",
    "the normal form ( [ nf2 ] ) is able to predicted and quantitatively describe this scenario @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ nf2 ] ) for wave trains supports two types of solutions .",
    "besides the homogeneous solution ( [ statio ] ) , @xmath42 , which may undergo a saddle - node bifurcation as described by ( [ sn_wt ] ) , there exists another stationary solution , an alternating mode @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 associated with this alternating solution is a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath46 when @xmath47 the pitchfork bifurcation sets in before the saddle - node bifurcation as can be readily seen from ( [ ai_pfa ] ) .",

    "the model consists of the standard cable equation @xmath298 where @xmath299 models the membrane current and @xmath300 is the capacity of the membrane . in @xcite the following form for the membrane current was proposed @xmath301 with a switch function @xmath302 the gate variable @xmath170 evolves according to @xmath303 the stable homogeneous rest state is at @xmath304 and @xmath305 ; however for small @xmath306 a second stable focus may arise . for details on the physiological interpretations of the model the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite . for the numerical integration",
    "we use again a semi - implicit pseudospectral crank - nicolson method where the nonlinearity is treated with an adams - bashforth scheme .",
    "we use a timestep of @xmath307 and @xmath308 spatial grid points . in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma1 ] we show an example for a subcritical hopf bifurcation in this model consistent with our theory .",
    "however , for sufficiently small @xmath306 a supercritical hopf bifurcation arises upon decreasing the ring length @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma2 ] we present a space - time plot for such a situation of stable oscillations .",
    "whereas the subcritical case is consistent with our theory we now have to understand why for small @xmath306 stable oscillations occur . in order to do so",
    "it is helpful to look at the spatial profiles of the activator and the inhibitor close to the hopf bifurcation which are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma3 ] . in the left figure",
    "we see the activator @xmath309 and the inhibitor @xmath310 for the case of a subcritical hopf bifurcation as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma1 ] .",
    "the figure is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig - barkley2 ] for the modified barkley model .",
    "the activator weakly interacts with the exponentially decaying tail of the inhibitor it created during its previous revolution . in this parameter region",
    "our normal form is valid and correctly predicts a subcritical bifurcation . in the right figure of fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma3 ] the situation is depicted for the supercritical case seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma2 ] .",
    "here the situation is very different .",
    "the inhibitor does not approach the homogeneous rest state @xmath311 but rather develops a metastable @xmath312 plateau .",
    "this has two consequences ; firstly , the solution is driven away from the homoclinic pulse solution around which the normal form is built , and secondly the interaction is not weak anymore .",
    "the reason for this different behaviour can be understood by looking at the nullclines of the homogeneous problem of ( [ echekarma1])-([echekarma3 ] ) , i.e. setting @xmath313 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - nullclines - echekarma ] we show the nullclines for the two cases @xmath314 ( supercritical ) and @xmath315 ( subcritical ) .",
    "note that for @xmath314 the only stable fix point is at @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "the difference is that in the supercritical case the @xmath316 nullcline and the @xmath317 nullcline are very close to each other .",
    "this forces the trajectory to spend a long time on the @xmath316-nullcline near @xmath318 ( as seen in the plateau part of the spatial profile of @xmath312 in fig .",
    "[ fig - echekarma2 ] ) .",
    "we call this state a metastable state . for decreasing ring length",
    "it dominates the profile of the inhibitor and does not allow the inhibitor to come close to the rest state @xmath305",
    ". therefore our normal form , which is formulated around the saddle - node of the pulse , breaks down .",
    "the solution is not close to the travelling pulse in phase space anymore and our local analysis around the saddle - node of the travelling wave can not work anymore .",
    "however , we note that the system ( [ echekarma1])-([echekarma3 ] ) is rather unusual with the two nullclines being parallel to each other with the possibility of a metastable state , resulting in rather particular dynamical behaviour .",
    "+    we may modify the model ( [ echekarma1])-([echekarma3 ] ) to break the degenerate situation in which the two nullclines of the inhibitor and activator run parallel to each other and subsequently may get too close to each other for certain parameters .",
    "we can destroy the existence of the metastable state for finite ring length by allowing the nullcline of the activator to bend away from the nullcline of the inhibitor if we , for example , consider the following modification of the membrane current @xmath319 with some sufficiently small @xmath320 .",
    "then we are again in the situation where the rest state @xmath304 and @xmath305 dominates the dynamics upon decreasing the ring length @xmath0 .",
    "the nullclines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - nullclines - echekarma ] .",
    "we confirmed that for @xmath321 the hopf bifurcation is indeed subcritical , consistent with our theoretical result .",
    "we note that the actual value of @xmath320 is not important for the existence of subcritical bifurcation but rather that a sufficiently small @xmath320 breaks the geometric structure of the degenerate nullclines and allows the activator nullcline to bend away from the inhibitor nullcline .",
    "the model ( [ echekarma1])-([echekarma3 ] ) illustrates for which class of excitable media our normal form is applicable and for which systems we may draw conclusions on the stability of dynamical alternans in a ring .",
