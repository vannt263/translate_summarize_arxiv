    "the contribution presented here is part of a course on compact objects and their emission given in the first la plata international school on astronomy and geophysics .",
    "the contribution is focused on the observational evidences of stellar mass black holes in our galaxy and the super - massive black hole in its centre .",
    "the four lectures that were given about the black holes in the galaxy have been distributed here in five sections .    in section 2 a brief account about how a neutron star or a black hole are formed is presented , a brief black hole history is also introduced and some concepts such as the schwarzchild radius ,",
    "the event horizon and kerr black hole are given .",
    "as the x - ray binaries play a fundamental role for the study of stellar mass black holes , section 3 is devoted to introduce the x - ray binaries and explain some of their most important characteristics . in section 4 ,",
    "the first black hole candidates are introduced , how were they discovered and how many of them are currently known .",
    "section 5 is devoted specifically to introduce the observational signatures of the black holes .",
    "in particular , some methods to estimate the mass , to find possible evidences for the event horizon and to measure the black hole spin are explained .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to the super - massive black hole in the centre of our galaxy .",
    "during their life stars evolve through different states that are linked to the nuclear burning .",
    "when the core of the star runs out of nuclear fuel , it collapses until some other form of pressure support enables a new equilibrium configuration to be attained . the possible equilibrium configurations which can exist when the star collapses are : white dwarfs ( wd ) , neutron stars ( ns ) , black holes ( bh ) . according the initial star mass ( @xmath0 ) , there will be different types of collapse and different supernova explosions . when @xmath0",
    "< 8m@xmath1 , there is no sn explosion , only contraction , and a wd is formed .",
    "if the wd accretes mass it will explode as a type ia sn .",
    "> 8m@xmath1 , thermonuclear sn explosions of different types are produced ( types ib , ic and no h lines ; types ii and h lines ) . as a result ,",
    "a ns or a bh is formed .    in wd and ns , the pressure which holds up",
    "the star is the quantum mechanical pressure associated with the fact that electrons , protons and neutrons are fermions ( only one particle is allowed to occupy any one quantum mechanical state ) .",
    "wd are held up by electron degeneracy pressure , and their mass is below the chandrasekhar limiting mass @xmath2 = 1.46m@xmath1 . with increasing density , the degenerate electron gas becomes relativistic and , when the total energy of the electron exceeds the mass difference between the neutron and the proton , the inverse @xmath3-decay process can convert protons into neutrons .",
    "it is the degeneracy pressure of this neutron gas which prevents collapse under gravity and results in the formation of a ns .",
    "the same physics for the wd is responsible for providing pressure support for the ns , the only difference being that the neutrons are about 2000 times more massive than the electrons , and consequently degeneracy sets in at a correspondingly higher density .",
    "ns , in which neutron degeneracy pressure is responsible for the pressure support , can have a mass given by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff mass limit .",
    "this mass is not analytically well fixed because of its dependence on the equations of state for nuclear matter . in any case",
    ", most equations of state do not allow the neutron degeneracy pressure to support more than 3m@xmath1 , indicating that dead stars more massive than 3m@xmath1must be bhs .",

    "john michell first described the concept of a black hole in a paper that appeared in philosophical transactions of the royal society of london in 1783 .",
    "michell discussed the possibility of a star with a gravitational force so strong that not even light could escape from it , thus preventing astronomers from observing such phenomena .",
    "pierre - simon laplace mentioned the possibility of such stars in the first few editions of his book exposition du systme du monde ( 1796 ) , although he failed to include it in later editions because the idea of a star with a gravitational force that could overpower light did not comply with the wave theory of light , which was generally accepted at that time .",
    "this theory seemed to suggest that light could not be affected by gravity , a concept that is key to the theories of michell and laplace . in the early 1800 s experiments on optical interference led to the predominance of the wave theory of light and the end of the corpuscular theory .",
    "since light waves were thought to be unaffected by gravitation , interest in the hypothetical `` dark stars '' ceased .    in 1905",
    "albert einstein published his special theory of relativity and in 1915 his general theory of relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the gr was a new theory of gravitation and one of its fundamental predictions was the effect of gravity on light .",
    "matter causes space - time to curve and therefore the paths followed by light rays or matter are determined by the curvature of the space - time .",
    "this allowed for a modern scientific proof of michell s hypothesis .",
    "a short time after einstein published his gr , the german physicist karl schwarzchild wrote a paper describing a structure called a singularity .",
    "he argued that matter could theoretically be drawn into a point with virtually no volume and a infinite density .",
    "he called this object a point mass , later dubbed a singularity .",
    "in addition , schwarzchild determined that there is a definite boundary around a singularity called the event horizon .    in 1928 , through his research on wd , subrahmanyan chandrasekhar hypothesized that a dying star of a certain mass might form a point with enough gravitational pull to trap light .    in 1939 , american physicist robert oppenheimer developed a possible explanation for the nature of these points of infinite density .",
    "oppenheimer theorized that the gravitational pull of a star with infinite density would cause light rays to deviate from their path and bend towards the star .",
    "eventually , the gravity of the star would become so great that the light would become trapped by it and would be unable to escape , preventing one from observing it .",
    "at this point the star is a bh .",
    "the american scientist john wheeler coined the term `` black hole '' in 1969 , although from a non astrophysical point of view , the expression `` black hole '' was coined before in calcutta to describe a small dungeon where troops of the nawab of bengal held british prisoners of war after the capture of fort william on june 20 , 1756 .      performing a classical calculation , the escape velocity from the surface of a star of mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 is    @xmath6    and setting @xmath7 , the radius of such star would be @xmath8 .",
    "as we will see later , this is just the expression for the schwarzchild radius of a bh of mass @xmath4 , and the spherical surface of radius @xmath5 plays the role of the surface of the bh .",
    "the escape velocity from the earth is 11 km s@xmath9 , from the sun is 617 km s@xmath9 , from a ns ( 2m@xmath1and radius 10 km ) is 230000 km s@xmath9 and from a bh should be greater than @xmath10 .",
    "some months after the einstein s definitive formulation of the gr in 1915 , schwarzschild discovered the solution for the metric of space - time about a point mass @xmath4 :    @xmath11\\ ] ]    this metric , known as the schwarzschild metric , has the same meaning as the interval d@xmath12 in special relativity , which is known as the minkowski metric :    @xmath13\\ ] ]    in the limit of large distances from the point mass , @xmath14 , the two metrics become the same .",
    "they are , however , very different for small values of @xmath5 , reflecting the influence of the mass @xmath4 upon the geometry of space - time . in the case of the schwarzschild metric",
    ", the time interval between events according to an observer who is stationary in s and located at the point @xmath5 is d@xmath15d@xmath16 .",
    "this notation makes it clear how the time interval d@xmath17 depends upon the gravitational potential in which the observer is located .",
    "d@xmath17 only reduces to d@xmath18 in the limit of very large distances from the origin , @xmath14 , at which the gravitational potential goes to zero .",
    "_ redshift of electromagnetic waves_. if the time interval @xmath19 corresponds to the period of the waves emitted at the point @xmath5 , the observed period of the wave at infinity @xmath20 is given by    @xmath21    therefore , the emitted and observed frequencies , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , are related by    @xmath24    this expression is the general relativistic result corresponding to michell s insight .",
    "if the radiation is emitted from radial coordinate @xmath25 , the frequency of any wave is redshifted to zero frequency , and no information can reach infinity from radii @xmath26 . here @xmath27 is the _",
    "schwarzschild radius_. since , according to gr , no radiation can escape from within this radius , the surface @xmath28 is black .",
    "the schwarzschild radius defines the _ event horizon_. not even light can escape , once it has crossed the event horizon .",
    "it can be written as @xmath29 km .",
    "another important aspect of the schwarzschild metric is the dynamics of test masses in the gravitational field of the point mass . in a newtonian treatment , from the conservation of energy",
    "we obtain    @xmath30    and from the conservation of angular momentum , @xmath31 . introducing the specific angular momentum of the particle ( angular momentum per unit mass )",
    "@xmath32 , we can write    @xmath33    as long as @xmath34 , the particle can not reach @xmath35 because the energy term associated with the centrifugal force , @xmath36 , becomes greater than the gravitational potential energy @xmath37 for small enough values of @xmath5 .    in a general relativistic treatment the dynamics of the test mass is given by    @xmath38    there are two main differences when comparing this relativistic equation with the newtonian equation .",
    "there is an extra term and constants and variables have different meaning in gr ( @xmath5 angular diameter distance , @xmath39 means d@xmath5/d@xmath40 , where @xmath40 is proper time , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants equivalent to @xmath41 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "the most important difference is the additional term @xmath44 , which has the effect of enhancing the attractive force of gravity , even when the particle has a finite specific angular momentum @xmath41 ( the greater the value of @xmath41 , the greater the enhancement ) .",
    "this result can be understood by recalling that the kinetic energy associated with the rotational motion around the point mass contributes to the inertial mass of a test particle and thus enhances the gravitational force upon it . from the analysis of the relativistic equation , some interesting results can be found : + 1 ) for sufficiently small values of @xmath5 , the general relativistic term@xmath44 becomes greater than the centrifugal potential term , implying that this purely general relativistic term increases the strength of gravity close enough to @xmath35 .",
    "it can be shown easily that if the specific angular momentum of the particle @xmath45 it will inevitably fall in to @xmath35 .",
    "+ 2 ) there is a last stable circular orbit , of radius @xmath46 , around the point mass .",
    "there are no stable circular orbits with smaller radii than this value because the particles would spiral rapidly into @xmath35 .",
    "this is why the bh is called hole , matter inevitably collapses in to @xmath35 if it comes too close to the point mass .",
    "+ 3 ) from the metric given in eq .",
    "[ eq : metric ] , it appears that there is a singularity at @xmath27 .",
    "it can be shown that this is not a physical singularity . however , at @xmath35 , there is a real physical singularity , and according to the gr , the infalling matter collapses to a singular point.however , these schwarzschild singularities are unobservable because no information can arrive to the external observer from within @xmath27 . for all practical purposes ,",
    "the bh may be considered to have a black spherical surface at @xmath27 . from the classical point of view ,",
    "physics breaks down at @xmath35 .",
    "_ kerr black holes_. in 1962 , kerr discovered the general solution for a bh with angular momentum @xmath47 .",
    "it has been shown that isolated bhs can be completely characterized by only three properties : mass @xmath4 , charge @xmath48 and angular momentum @xmath47 .",
    "the rotating bhs ( kerr bhs ) are relevant to many aspects of high energy astrophysics .",
    "the kerr metric in boyer - landquist coordinates is given by :    @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the angular momentum of the bh per unit mass , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if the bh is non - rotating , @xmath53 and the kerr metric reduces to the standard schwarzschild metric . just as in the case of schwarschild metric , the metric coefficient of d@xmath54 becomes singular at a certain radial distance , when @xmath55 .",
    "this radius correspond to the surface of infinite redshift or the horizon of the rotating bh , and is given by the solution of @xmath56 .",
    "taking the larger of the two roots , the horizon occurs at radius    @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    this spherical surface has exactly the same properties as the schwarschild radius in the case of non - rotating bhs .",
    "particles and photons can fall in through this radius , but they can not emerge outwards according to the classical theory of gr . if the system has too much angular momentum j , no bh will be formed .",
    "the maximum angular momentum corresponds to @xmath58 . for a maximally rotating bh ,",
    "the horizon radius is @xmath59 , just half the result for the case of schwarschild bh , @xmath60 . for maximally rotating bhs",
    "the last stable circular orbit is located at ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) @xmath61 for corotating test particles and at @xmath62 for counter - rotating particles .",
    "( recall : for non - rotating bhs , the last stable orbit is at @xmath63 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the maximum binding energies of these orbits can be found , that is , the amount of energy that has to be lost in order for the material to attain a bound stable circular orbit with radius r. in the corotating case , 42.3% of the rest mass energy of the material can be released as it spirals into the bh through a sequence of almost circular equatorial orbits . in the counter - rotating case it is 3.8% .",
    "this is the process by which energy is liberated through the accretion of matter onto bhs , and is likely to be the source of energy in some of the most extreme astrophysical objects .",
    "the energy available is much greater than that attainable from nuclear fusion processes , which at most can release about 1% of the rest mass energy of matter .",
    "a more complete treatment of the topics developed in this subsection can be found in longair ( 1994a , 1994b ) .",
    "an x - ray binary is a binary system containing a compact object , either a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole , that emits x - rays as a result of a process of accretion of matter from the companion star .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain this x - ray emission , depending on the nature of the compact object , its magnetic field in the case of a neutron star , and the geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "the accreted matter is accelerated to relativistic speeds , transforming its potential energy provided by the intense gravitational field of the compact object into kinetic energy . assuming that this kinetic energy is finally radiated , the accretion luminosity can be computed , finding that this mechanism provides a very efficient source of energy , even much higher efficiency than that for nuclear reactions .    on its way to the compact object",
    ", the accreted matter carries angular momentum and usually forms an accretion disk around it .",
    "the matter in the disc looses angular momentum due to viscous dissipation , which produces a heating of the disc , and falls towards the compact object in a spiral trajectory .",
    "the black body temperature of the last stable orbit in the case of a bh accreting at the eddington limit is given by : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is expressed in kelvin and @xmath4 in m@xmath1 ( rees 1984 ) .",
    "for a compact object of a few solar masses , @xmath66  k. at this temperature the energy is mainly radiated in the x - ray domain .    in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )",
    "the donor star is an o or b early type star of mass in the range @xmath67@xmath68  m@xmath1 and typical orbital periods of several days .",
    "hmxbs are conventionally divided into two subgroups : systems containing a b star with emission lines ( be stars ) , and systems containing a supergiant ( sg ) o or b star . in the first case ,",
    "the be stars do not fill their roche lobe , and accretion onto the compact object is produced via mass transfer through a decretion disc .",
    "most of these systems are transient x - ray sources during periastron passage . in the second case ,",
    "ob sg stars , the mass transfer is due to a strong stellar wind and/or to roche lobe overflow .",
    "the x - ray emission is persistent , and large variability is common .",
    "the most recent catalogue of hmxbs was compiled by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and contains 242 sources .    in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs )",
    "the donor has a spectral type later than b , and a mass @xmath69  m@xmath1 .",
    "although it is typically a non - degenerated star , there are some examples where the donor is a wd .",
    "the orbital periods are in the range 0.2400 hours , with typical values @xmath70 hours .",
    "the orbits are usually circular , and mass transfer is due to roche lobe overflow .",
    "most lmxbs are transients , probably as a result of an instability in the accretion disc or a mass ejection episode from the companion .",
    "the typical ratio between x - ray to optical luminosity is in the range @xmath71@xmath72 , and the optical emission is dominated by x - ray heating of the accretion disc and the companion star .",
    "some lmxbs are classified as ` z ' and ` atoll ' sources , according to the pattern traced out in the x - ray color - color diagram . ` z ' sources are thought to be weak magnetic field neutron stars of the order of @xmath73  g with accretion rates around 0.51.0  @xmath74 . `",
    "atoll ' sources are believed to have even weaker magnetic fields of @xmath75  g and lower accretion rates of 0.010.1  @xmath74 .",
    "the most recent catalogue of lmxbs was compiled by liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and contains 188 sources .",
    "recently , grimm et al . (",
    "2002 ) estimated that the total number of x - ray binaries in the galaxy brighter than 2@xmath76 erg  s@xmath9 is about 705 , being distributed as @xmath77325 lmxbs and @xmath77380 hmxbs .",
    "the first x - ray binary known to display radio emission was sco  x-1 in the late 1960s .",
    "since then , many x - ray binaries have been detected at radio wavelengths with flux densities @xmath78@xmath79  mjy .",
    "the flux densities detected are produced in small angular scales , which rules out a thermal emission mechanism .",
    "the most efficient known mechanism for production of intense radio emission from astronomical sources is the synchrotron emission mechanism , in which highly relativistic electrons interacting with magnetic fields produce intense radio emission that tends to be linearly polarized .",
    "the observed radio emission can be explained by assuming a spatial distribution of non - thermal relativistic electrons , usually with a power - law energy distribution , interacting with magnetic fields .    since some rexbs , like ss  433 ,",
    "were found to display elongated or jet - like features , as in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and quasars , it was proposed that flows of relativistic electrons were ejected perpendicular to the accretion disc , and were responsible for synchrotron radio emission in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "models of adiabatically expanding synchrotron radiation - emitting conical jets may explain some of the characteristics of radio emission from x - ray binaries ( hjellming & johnston 1988 ) .",
    "several models have been proposed for the formation and collimation of the jets , including the presence of an accretion disc close to the compact object , a magnetic field in the accretion disc , or a high spin for the compact object .",
    "however , there is no clear agreement on what mechanism is exactly at work .",
    "there are eight radio emitting hmxbs and 35 radio emitting lmxbs .",
    "since the strong magnetic field of the x - ray pulsars disrupts the accretion disc at several thousand kilometers from the neutron star , there is no inner accretion disc to launch a jet and no synchrotron radio emission has ever been detected in any of these sources .",
    "although the division of x - ray binaries in hmxbs and lmxbs is useful for the study of binary evolution , it is probably not important for the study of the radio emission in these systems , where the only important aspect seems to be the presence of an inner accretion disc capable of producing radio jets .",
    "however , the eight radio emitting hmxbs include six persistent and two transient sources , while among the 35 radio emitting lmxbs we find 11 persistent and 24 transient sources .",
    "the difference between the persistent and transient behavior clearly depends on the mass of the donor .    excluding x - ray pulsars , @xmath68 to @xmath80 of the catalogued galactic x - ray binaries",
    "have been detected at radio wavelengths regardless of the nature of the donor .",
    "the corresponding ratio of detected / observed sources is probably much higher .",
    "however , it is difficult to give reliable numbers , since observational constrains arise when considering transient sources observed in the past ( large x - ray error boxes , single dish and/or poor sensitivity radio observations , etc . ) , and likely many non - detections have not been published .",
    "a microquasar is a radio emitting x - ray binary displaying relativistic radio jets .",
    "the name was given not only because of the observed morphological similarities between these sources and the distant quasars but also because of physical similarities , since when the compact object is a black hole , some parameters scale with the mass of the central object ( mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) . a schematic illustration comparing some parameters in quasars and microquasars is shown in figure  [ qmq ] .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : tlast ] , a typical temperature of the accretion disc of a microquasar containing a stellar mass black hole is @xmath81  k , while that of a quasar containing a super - massive black hole ( @xmath82@xmath83  @xmath84 ) is @xmath85  k. this explains why in microquasars the accretion luminosity is radiated in x - rays , while in quasars it is radiated in the optical / uv domain .",
    "the characteristic jet sizes appear to be proportional to the mass of the black hole .",
    "radio jets in microquasars have typical sizes of a few light years , while in quasars may reach distances of up to several million light years .",
    "the timescales are also directly scaled with the mass of the black hole following @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , phenomena that take place in timescales of years in quasars can be studied in minutes in microquasars .",
    "thus , microquasars mimic , on smaller scales , many of the phenomena seen in agns and quasars , but allow a better and faster progress in the understanding of the accretion / ejection processes that take place near compact objects .",
    "the current number of confirmed microquasars is @xmath7716 among the 43 catalogued rexbs ( paredes 2005 ) .",
    "some authors ( fender 2001 ) have proposed that all rexbs are microquasars , and would be detected as such provided that there is enough sensitivity and/or resolution in the radio observations .",
    "the theoretical models attempting to understand the jet formation and its connection with the accretion disc had a seminal contribution in the works by blandford & payne ( 1982 ) .",
    "these authors explored the possibility of extracting energy and angular momentum from the accretion disc by means of a magnetic field whose lines extend towards large distances from the disc surface .",
    "their main result was the confirmation of the theoretical possibility to generate a flow of matter outwards from the disc itself , provided that the angle between the disc and the field lines was smaller than 60@xmath87 .",
    "later on , the flow of matter is collimated at large distances from the disc by the action of a toroidal component of the magnetic field . in this way",
    ", two opposite jets could be formed flowing away perpendicularly to the accretion disc plane .    to confirm observationally",
    "the link between accretion disc and the genesis of the jets is by no means an easy task .",
    "the collimated ejections in grs  1915 + 105 provide one of the best studied cases supporting the proposed disc / jet connection . in figure",
    "[ grs1915 ] , from mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , simultaneous observations are presented at radio , infrared and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the data show the development of a radio outburst , with a peak flux density of about 50  mjy , as a result of a bipolar ejection of plasma clouds . however ,",
    "preceding the radio outburst there was a clear precursor outburst in the infrared .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that both flaring episodes , radio and infrared , were due to synchrotron radiation generated by the same relativistic electrons of the ejected plasma .",
    "the adiabatic expansion of plasma clouds in the jets causes an energy loss in the electron population and , as a result , the spectral maximum of their synchrotron radiation is progressively shifted from the infrared to the radio domain .",
    "it is also important to note the behaviour of the x - ray emission in figure  [ grs1915 ] .",
    "the emergence of jet plasma clouds , that produce the infrared and radio flares , seems to be accompanied by a sharp decay and hardening of the x - ray emission ( 8.088.23  h ut in the figure ) .",
    "the x - ray fading is interpreted as the disappearance , or emptying , of the inner regions of the accretion disc ( belloni et al .",
    "part of the matter content in the disc is then ejected into the jets , perpendicularly to the disc , while the rest is finally captured by the central black hole . additionally , mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that the initial time of the ejection coincides with the isolated x - ray spike just when the hardness ratio suddenly declines ( 8.23  h ut ) .",
    "the recovery of the x - ray emission level at this point is interpreted as the progressive refilling of the inner accretion disc with a new supply of matter until reaching the last stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "this behaviour in the light curves of grs  1915 + 105 has been repeatedly observed by different authors ( e.g. fender et al .",
    "1997 ; eikenberry et al .",
    "1998 ) , providing thus a solid proof of the so - called disc / jet symbiosis in accretion discs .",
    "all the observed events were shorter than 1/2 h , and their equivalent in quasars , or agns , would require a much longer minimum time span of some few years . despite the complexity in the grs  1915 + 105 light curves , the episodes of x - ray emission decay with associated hardening are reminiscent of the well known low / hard state typical of persistent black hole candidates ( cygnus  x-1 , 1e  1740.7@xmath882942 , grs  1758@xmath88258 and gx  339@xmath884 ) .",
    "the transitions towards this state are often accompanied by radio emission with flat spectrum , interpreted as due to the continuous creation of partially self - absorbed compact synchrotron jets .",
    "it is worth mentioning the observational work by marscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who presented evidence of the disc / jet symbiosis also in the active galaxy 3c  120 . using vlbi techniques they observed episodes of ejection of superluminal plasma just after the decay and hardening of the x - ray emission .",
    "this is precisely the same behaviour displayed by grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the events in 3c  120 seem to be recurrent with an interval of one year , which is consistent with a mass of the compact object of @xmath89 m@xmath1 .",
    "such observations strongly support the idea of continuity between galactic microquasars and agns in the universe .",
    "one of the first optical counterparts to be identified was the 9th magnitude supergiant star hd 226868 , associated with the hmxb cyg x-1 .",
    "it showed radial velocity variations which made it a prime candidate for a stellar mass bh ( webster & murdin 1972 , bolton 1972 ) .",
    "the supergiant star was shown to move with a velocity amplitude of  64 km  s@xmath9(later refined to 75 km  s@xmath9 ) in a 5.6 day orbit due to the gravitational influence of an unseen companion ( see fig .",

    "the lightcurves of companion stars in contact binaries display the characteristic double - humped variation on the orbital period , with amplitudes @xmath139 .",
    "this modulation is a consequence of the tidal distortion of the secondary star and the non - uniform distribution of the surface brightness , due to a combination of limb and gravity darkening .",
    "the dependence of @xmath94 on the local surface gravity @xmath93 implies that the inner hemisphere of the secondary ( facing the compact object ) will be cooler and , therefore , the phase 0.5 minimum becomes deeper than the minimum at phase 0 .",

    ", the amplitude is a strong ( increasing ) function of @xmath92 , and is insensitive to @xmath136 if @xmath140 .",

    "there are 20 xrbs that lack radial velocity data .",
    "most of them even lack an optical counterpart , and only three have known orbital periods . nevertheless , they are considered black - hole candidates because they closely resemble black hole binaries in their x - ray spectral and temporal behavior ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately , they have never been seen in quiescence , or they simply become too faint for an optical detection of the companion star .",
    "fortunately , a new technique to extract dynamical information during their x - ray active states has been applied recently .",
    "it utilises narrow high - excitation emission lines powered by irradiation on the companion star , in particular the strong ciii and fluorescence niii lines from the bowen blend at @xmath141463040 .",
    "this technique was first applied to the ns lmxb sco x-1 and the doppler shift of the ciii / niii lines enabled the motion of the donor star to be traced for the first time ( steeghs & casares 2002 ) .",
    "this was also attempted during the 2002 outburst of the bh candidate gx 339 - 4 , using high - resolution spectroscopy to resolve the sharp niii / ciii lines .",
    "the orbital solution yields a velocity semi - amplitude of 317 km s@xmath9 which defines a strict lower limit to the velocity amplitude of the companion star because these lines arise from the irradiated hemisphere and not the centre of mass of the donor .",
    "a solid lower bound to the mass function is 5.8 m@xmath1 which provides compelling evidence for a bh in gx 339@xmath884 ( hynes et al .",
    "this technique opens an avenue to extract dynamical information from new xrts in outburst and x - ray persistent lmxbs , which hopefully will help increase the number of bh discoveries .      in order to show that a dynamical bh candidate ( i.e. , a massive compact object ) is a genuine bh , one would hope to demonstrate that the candidate has an event horizon - the defining characteristic of a bh .",
    "the first test for the presence of the event horizon was carried out by narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using archival x - ray data .",
    "one had to wait for chandra before one could claim definitive evidence .",
    "strong evidence has been obtained for the reality of the event horizon from observations that compare bhbs with very similar ns binaries .",

    "the orbital period is a predictor of @xmath142 , according to binary mass transfer models ( menou et al .",
    "1999 ) . by comparing quiescent bhs and nss with similar orbital periods , the uncertainty in the mass accretion rate is eliminated ( garcia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the explanation for this result is that accretion in these quiescent systems occurs via a radiatively inefficient mode ( advection - dominated accretion ) , as confirmed through spectral studies ( e.g , narayan et al . 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the disc luminosity @xmath143 and most of the binding energy that is released as gas falls into the potential well is retained in the gas as thermal energy . in the case of an accreting ns",
    ", this energy is eventually radiated from the stellar surface , and so an external observer still sees the full accretion luminosity @xmath144 . in the case of a bh",
    ", however , the superheated gas falls through the event horizon , carrying all its thermal energy with it .",
    "the observer therefore sees only the disc luminosity @xmath145 which is extremely small .",
    "bhs lack a soft thermal component of emission that is very prevalent in the spectra of nss and can be ascribed to surface emission ( mcclintock et al .",

    "it is concluded that in the accreting ns with a weak magnetic field , significant power is contained at frequencies close to one khz . in the case of the accreting bh ,",

    "sunyaev & revnivtsev propose to explain the observed difference as a result of the existence of a radiation dominated spreading layer on the ns surface .",
    "the classic colour - colour diagram of xrbs at high accretion rates shows a clear separation in the evolution of ns and bh binaries .",
    "this has been ascribed to the presence of a boundary layer in ns which gives rise to an additional thermal component in the spectrum and drags ns outside the bh region ( done & gierlinski 2003 ) .",
    "+ all approaches to this subject can provide only indirect evidence for the event horizon because it is quite impossible to detect directly any radiation from this immaterial surface of infinite redshift .",

    "an astrophysical bh is described by two parameters , its mass @xmath4 and its dimensionless spin parameter @xmath147 .",

    "the effect is due to the strong gravitational bending of light rays . in the newtonian approximation ,",

    "the implied density of matter is too high to allow a cluster of dark stars or stellar remnants .",
    "ngc  4258 and the milky way give us important proof that bh exist .",
    "the velocity dispersion increases to 400 km  s@xmath9 at a distance of 0.03 lightyears from sgr a@xmath168 . here",
    "stars have such small orbits that they revolve around the galactic centre in a few decades .",
    "motions in the plane of the sky have been measured for these stars for several years ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ; ghez et al . 2005 ) . from a global fit to the positions and radial velocities of the six best stars ( see figure  [ orbits ] ) within 0.5\"(=0.02 pc ) of sgr a@xmath168 improved three dimensional stellar orbits were derived and their orbital parameters updated .",
    "the updated estimate for the distance to the galactic centre from the s2 orbit fit is @xmath171 kpc , resulting in a central mass value of @xmath172m@xmath1 ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "vlbi observations of sgr a@xmath168 have revealed an east  west elongated structure whose apparent angular size at longer wavelengths is dominated by the interstellar scattering angle , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the observed size , in mas , at wavelength @xmath175 in cm .",
    "thus , vlbi observations at shorter millimetre wavelengths , where the intrinsic structure of sgr a@xmath168 could become comparable to the pure scattering size , are expected to show deviations of the observed size from the scattering law .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the detection of the intrinsic size at 7 mm ( bower et al .",
    "more recently , zhi - qiang shen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , carried out observations with the vlba at 3.5 mm of sgr a@xmath168 .",
    "they report a radio image of sgr a@xmath168 , demonstrating that its size is 1au .",
    "this high - resolution image of sgr a@xmath168 , made at 3.5 mm , also exhibits an elongated structure .",
    "when combined with the lower limit on its mass , the lower limit on the mass density is @xmath176m@xmath1 pc@xmath177 , which provides strong evidence that sgr a@xmath168 is a super - massive bh .",
    "detection of variable infrared ( 3.8 micron ) light coincident to within 18 mas ( 1 @xmath178 ) of the super - massive bh at the centre of the milky way galaxy and the radio source sgr a@xmath168 was reported by ghez et al .",
    "the brightness variations , which occur on timescales as short as 40 minutes , reveal that the emission arises quite close to the bh , within 5 au , or 80@xmath27 .",
    "two k - band flares observed on the 15th and 16th of june 2003 show a quasi - periodicity of about 17 min ( genzel et al .",
    "the only reasonable explanation for this so short period is that the oscillations are produced by doppler boosting of hot gas near the last stable orbit of a spinning kerr bh .",
    "the spin of the bh will allow for a last stable orbit closer to the event horizon and thus with a shorter orbital frequency .",
    "from the observed 17 min quasi - periodicity it is estimated that the super - massive bh sgr a@xmath168 has a spin that is half of the maximum possible spin of such an object ( genzel et al .",
    "additional observations of flares and their quasi - periodicity will be needed in order to confirm this result .      in the x - ray regime ,",
    "sgra@xmath168 was found to exhibit two different states . in the quiescent state",
    ", weak x - ray emission appears to come from a slightly extended area around the bh that appears to be evidence of hot accreting gas in the environment of sgra@xmath168 .",
    "sgra@xmath168 shows x - ray flares with a recurrence of about one per day . during these flares ,",
    "the emission rises by factors up to 100 during several tens of minutes and a distinctive point source becomes visible at the location of sgra@xmath168 .",
    "the short rise - and - decay times of the flares suggest that the radiation must originate from a region within less than 10@xmath27 of a @xmath179m@xmath1 bh ( boganoff et al .",

    "time has effects in the orbits around bhs .",
    "mueller ( 2007 ) shows relativistically distorted images of tight orbits around bhs for different inclination angles and for schwarzchild and kerr bhs . when viewed by a distant observer at infinity , in nearly edge  on situations the observer would detect different apparent orbit shapes depending on bh spin .",
    "these orbit shapes become asymmetric in the case of rotating bhs .",
    "the maximum relative spatial offset predicted is 0.08@xmath180 .",
    "this means that it might be possible to detect it by observing the galactic centre bh but not by observing an stellar bh .",
    "the reason is that the angular size corresponding to an schwarzschild radius of a super - massive bh is about three orders of magnitude larger than the an stellar mass bh .",
