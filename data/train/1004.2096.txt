    "these results clearly show that the effects of nucleon - nucleon scattering in the medium on knockout reactions are worth considering , specially for reactions involving loosely - bound halo nuclei .",
    "it is not clear however which of the several parametrizations of medium effects is more adequate for the precision required by experiments .    , but for the transverse momentum distribution . ]",
    "the present work has extended the theory of one - nucleon stripping and diffraction dissociation reactions to cover the dependence of the nucleon knockout cross sections and momentum distributions on the medium modifications of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections .",
    "we included the most commonly used parametrizations in the literature and compared the effects of pauli blocking from a simple geometrical picture to a more elaborated dirac - brueckner calculation , as well as phenomenological parametrizations .",
    "we have shown that the density dependences vary rather strongly from model to model for reasons which are not yet clear .",
    "we have also shown that the nucleon knockout reactions involving halo nuclei are more sensitive to medium modifications of the nn cross section than in the case of the removal of more bound nucleons . the changes amount to 10% in some cases , especially at lower energies .",
    "but due to the average of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections over the local densities , the changes are not always predictable at higher energies .",
    "the stripping and diffraction dissociation cross sections decrease and increase in the same way whenever the nn cross sections decrease or increase from one parametrization to another .",
    "the momentum distributions , are not appreciably different , except for their absolute normalization , when the nucleon - nucleon cross sections change with medium modifications .",
    "this has been verified for both longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the simple study of the density - dependent nn cross - section adopted in this work shows that the calculations are sometimes sensitive to the value of the density - dependence method under consideration . besides pauli - blocking and medium changes in the nn cross section , fermi - motion",
    "should probably play an important role in the nucleon knockout reactions and is worth further investigation .",
    "no attempt has been done to compare to experimental results , which would probably affect the extracted values of the spectroscopic strengths in reactions with rare isotopes .",
    "this certainly deserves further theoretical studies .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the magnitude of the corrections observed in this work , of about 10% for the total cross sections are based on the optical limit ( ol ) of the glauber multiple scattering theory .",
    "the optical limit means that only single binary nn collisions are included . in the present work correlations within the projectile and target wave functions",
    "have been neglected .",
    "these have been studied , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , or more recently in ref . @xcite . in these references",
    ", the influence of these correlations on the calculations has been studied , and found to be also of the order of 10% .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the corrections observed in the present work .",
    "it is not clear if these two unrelated corrections will add up to a larger correction of the knockout cross sections , which could in fact modify appreciably the spectroscopic factors published in the literature where such corrections where not included .",
    "this also qualifies for further investigation .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that medium modifications of nucleon - nucleon scattering have also been studied in several publications related to ( p,2p ) reactions ( see , e.g. refs @xcite ) .",
