    "the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons with neutral hydrogen atoms leads to a local boltzmann distribution of the photon spectrum around the ly@xmath0 frequency @xmath1 with color temperature equal to the kinetic temperature @xmath5 of hydrogen gas .",
    "consequently , the spin temperature @xmath6 of the hyperfine structure of neutral hydrogen will be coupled to the kinetic temperature of hydrogen gas .",
    "this is the so - called wouthuysen - field ( w - f ) coupling ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 , 1959 ) .",
    "the w - f coupling is crucial to estimate the redshifted 21 cm signal from the halos of first generation of stars , because the deviation of the spin temperature from the temperature of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xmath7 is considered to be mainly caused by the w - f coupling ( e.g. furlanetto et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the lifetime of the first stars is short .",
    "the ionized and heated halos around the first luminous objects are strongly time - dependent .",
    "the time scale of the evolution of the expected 21 cm emission / absorption regions can be as small as 10@xmath8 years ( cen 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "therefore , the 21 cm signal models based on the w - f coupling would be reasonable only if the time scale of the onset of the w - f coupling is less than that of the 21 cm region evolution .",
    "this time evolution has been studied very recently ( roy et al .",
    "2009a , hereafter referred to as paperi ) .",
    "it concludes that the local boltzmann distribution can form within a time scale shorter than 10@xmath8 years , but it would take 10@xmath9 years or even longer to reach its saturation ( time - independent ) state .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to assume that the w - f coupling is taking place in the 21 cm emission / absorption regions , but the intensity of the photon flux is less than the time - independent solution .",
    "paperi studied , however , only the case of spatial homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "it is equivalent to assume that the ly@xmath0 photons are uniformly distributed in the entire 21 cm signal region .",
    "this assumption is not trivial .",
    "all the ly@xmath0 photons in the 21 cm regions come from first stars , either from direct emission of ly@xmath0 photons , or from the hubble redshifted photons . on the other hand ,",
    "the 21 cm regions are highly opaque for ly@xmath0 photons",
    ". the w - f coupling may not be uniformly available in the 21 cm signal region , if the time scale of the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in the physical space is longer than that of the evolution of the 21 cm region .",
    "the problem of ly@xmath0 photon transfer in optical thick media is not new .",
    "it has been addressed as early as 1960s in relation to the escape of resonant photons from opaque clouds ( osterbrock 1962 ; harrington 1973 ; avery & house 1968 ; adams 1972 ) . in these references",
    "it is shown that the diffusion of the photon distribution in the frequency space caused by the resonant scattering will be helpful to speed up the spatial diffusion . in the past decade , there are also many works on the escape of ly@xmath0 photons from high redshift objects with the mechanism of hubble redshift ( e.g. miralda - escude & rees 1998 ; loeb & rybicki 1999 ; zheng & miralda - escude 2002 ; haiman & cen 2005 ; tasitsiomi 2006 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "the hubble redshifted ly@xmath0 photons are also easy to take spatial transfer .",
    "although both the resonant scattering and the hubble redshift are useful to solve the problem of ly@xmath0 photon transfer in the 21 cm region , they rely on the change of photon frequency from @xmath1 to @xmath10 . therefore , the local boltzmann frequency distribution will be disturbed , even if it initially is in the state of local boltzmann frequency distribution .",
    "thus , it is unclear whether the w - f coupling keeps to work timely and uniformly in the 21 cm region .    in this context",
    ", a time - dependent solution of the kinetics of ly@xmath0 photons in both physical and frequency spaces of the 21 cm region is necessary .",
    "this is the topic of the current paper .",
    "we will show that the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons is effective to solve the problem of spatial transfer in optical thick 21 cm region as well as to keep the w - f coupling working . on the other hand , for 21 cm regions of short lifetime objects , the cosmic expansion does not provide effective mechanism for the spatial transfer of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "similar to paperi , we use the numerical solution of the time - dependent integrodifferential equation of the radiative transfer with resonant scattering .",
    "the numerical solver is based on the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme ( jiang & shu 1996 ) .",
    "weno scheme is effective in solving boltzmann equations ( carrillo et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) and radiative transfer ( qiu et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the algorithm related to resonant scattering has also been given in roy et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "this numerical solver has successfully passed the tests of analytic solutions and conservation of photon number .",
    "therefore , it is a good candidate for computing the current problem .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 addresses the physical problems of ly@xmath0 photon transfer in the 21 cm emission and absorption regions of luminous objects .",
    "section 3 is on the time scale of the transfer of resonant scattering in the frequency space .",
    "section 4 presents ly@xmath0 photon transfer in the frequency and physical spaces .",
    "these results can be used for the 21 cm signal region (  5 ) .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in section 6 .",
    "the details of the numerical implementation are given in the appendix .",
    "the property of the ionized and heated regions around an individual luminous object is dependent on the luminosity ( or mass ) , the spectrum of uv photon emission , and the time - evolution of the center object ( cen 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "we will not work on a specific model , but consider only the common features .",
    "these halos generally consist of three spheres .",
    "the most inner region of the halo is the highly ionized strmgren sphere , or the hii region , in which the fraction of neutral hydrogen @xmath11 is no more than 10@xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the number densities of neutral hydrogen hi and total hydrogen .",
    "the temperature of the hii region is about 10@xmath15 k. the physical radius of this sphere is in the range of a few to a few tens of kpc .",
    "the second region is the 21 cm emission shell , which is just outside the hii region .",
    "the physical size of this shell is similar to that of the hii sphere .",
    "the temperature of hydrogen gas in the emission shell is in the range @xmath16 k due to the heating of uv photons .",
    "the fraction @xmath17 is in the range of 0.1 to 1 .",
    "the third region is the 21 cm absorption shell , which is outside the 21 cm emission region .",
    "the physical size is on the order of 100 kpc .",
    "the temperature of this region is lower than @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the temperature of cmb today .",
    "the time scale of the formation of the halos is about 10@xmath20 years .",
    "the lifetime of the halos is about the same as the lifetime of the first stars .    at the epoch of redshift @xmath21 ,",
    "the reionization region consists of isolated patches around first sources .",
    "most ly@xmath0 photons in the 21 cm regions should come from the central source and the subsequent re - emission processes . if one can estimate the center object as a ly@xmath0 emitter ,",
    "the emission of ly@xmath0 photons in number per unit time would be about @xmath22 s@xmath23 .",
    "the recombination of hii and electron in the strmgren sphere is also a source of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "if the physical radius of the strmgren sphere is @xmath24 kpc , the emission intensity is about @xmath25 s@xmath23 .    using the parameters of the concordance @xmath26cdm model , the optical depths of photons with ly@xmath0 resonant frequency @xmath1 in the 21 cm region are @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cross section of the resonant scattering at the frequency @xmath1",
    ", @xmath29 is the physical size of the considered sphere , and @xmath2 is the distance @xmath29 in the units of the mean free path of @xmath1 photons at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) shows that the optical depth of the 21 cm signal regions with @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "it is also useful to define a dimensionless time @xmath33 as @xmath34 this is the time in the units of mean free flight - time . for a time scale",
    "@xmath35 yrs , the scale of @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "there are , at least , two radiative transfer problems with the w - f coupling in the 21 cm regions : a. ) how to provide enough ly@xmath0 photons in such opaque medium ?",
    "b. ) can the radiative transfer in the 21 cm region keep the w - f coupling to work well ?    if photons _",
    "always _ keep the frequency @xmath1 , their spatial diffusion can be described as a random walk process ( chandrasekar 1943 ) .",
    "the mean number of scattering required for the diffusion over a range @xmath29 is on the order of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the time for the diffusion over the 21 cm range is @xmath38 , corresponding to the time @xmath39 years .",
    "this diffusion mechanism , obviously , is useless for the 21 cm regions .",
    "the time scale of the diffusion would be substantially reduced if the frequency of the ly@xmath0 photons can have a small shift from @xmath1 to @xmath40 , because the optical depth @xmath2 at the frequency @xmath10 is significantly less than @xmath41 .",
    "one can estimate the frequency shift @xmath42 by the condition of optical depth @xmath43 , which is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the voigt function for the resonant line @xmath1 profile as ( hummer 1965 ) @xmath46 where the dimensionless variable @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the doppler broadening of hydrogen gas with thermal velocity @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 measures the frequency deviation @xmath51 in the units of the doppler broadening .",

    "an effective mechanism of the frequency shift is given by the diffusion of the photon distribution in the frequency space .",

    "since @xmath55 , the time scale of the spatial diffusion over size @xmath29 is comparable to @xmath56 .",
    "problem a would then be solved .",
    "problem b still remains . if photons with the frequency @xmath57 or @xmath58 take a faster spatial diffusion than the @xmath1 photons , how can we keep the w - f coupling to work ? without @xmath1 photons",
    ", one can not have a local boltzmann distribution around @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the photons with the frequency @xmath59 or @xmath60 should be brought back to the frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we must study whether the frequency space diffusion mechanism can restore @xmath1 photons from photons with the frequency @xmath4",
    ".    cosmic expansion also leads to a deviation of photon frequency from @xmath1 to a lower one @xmath61 , which speeds up the spatial transfer .",
    "however , we also need a mechanism to restore ly@xmath0 photons from hubble redshifted photons .",
    "therefore , in terms of the w - f coupling in the 21 cm region , we must study the kinetics of ly@xmath0 photons in both physical and frequency spaces .",
    "we first estimate the time scale needed for the frequency shift .",
    "we can use the radiative transfer equation of a homogeneous and isotropically expanding infinite medium consisting of neutral hydrogen .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) by dropping the terms of absorption and re - emission .",
    "the equation is @xmath75 assuming the source is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the normalized frequency profile of the source photons .",

    "define the mean frequency by @xmath80 if the initial flux is @xmath81 , one can show that for any profile @xmath77 we have @xmath82 as expected , the speed of redshift @xmath83 is a constant .",
    "for the hubble expansion , a frequency shift @xmath47 needs a time @xmath84 .",

    "this scale seems to be short enough compared with the lifetime of first stars . however , hubble redshift is less effective comparing with the resonant scattering .",

    "it may yield a low brightness temperature of the 21 cm signals .    although the mechanism of `` escape via shortcut '' plus `` bounce back '' helps ly@xmath0 diffusion , it does not mean that this mechanism will reduce the gunn - peterson optical depth of the ly@xmath0 photons . on the contrary",
    ", the resonant scattering will lead to a slight increase of the optical depth of the ly@xmath0 in the 21 cm region , as the resonant scattering impedes the cosmic redshift ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , there should be no observable redshifted optical signal with the frequency @xmath208 to be spatially correlated with the @xmath209 redshifted 21 cm signal .",

    "thus , subsequent evolution of the ly@xmath0 photons in the 21 cm region is to diffuse to a large sphere around the first stars . at the same time",
