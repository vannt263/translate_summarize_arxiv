    "<S> new _ bvri _ light curves of the eclipsing binary system 1swasp j160156.04 + 202821.6 have been obtained with the 1.88 meter telescope of kottamia astronomical observatory ( kao ) , egypt on june , 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> new twenty times of minima of the system j1601 and new ephemeris have been reduced and derived from the present photometry . a preliminary determination of the geometric and photometric element parameters of the system j1601 has been derived .    the eclipsing binary system 1swasp j160156.04 + 202821.6 ( j1601 , @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 = + @xmath3 ) was discovered as a variable star by norton et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2011 ) . </S>",
    "<S> he reported that the orbital period of the system j1601 is 0.22653d . </S>",
    "<S> photometric observations of the eclipsing binary system j1601 have been obtained in _ </S>",
    "<S> b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ and i wide pass - band filters through three nights , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 of june , 2013 , using eev ccd 42 - 40 camera attached to the newtonian focus of the 1.88-m telescope of kottamia astronomical observatory ( kao ) , egypt . </S>",
    "<S> differential photometry was performed with respect to gsc 0151100135 and gsc 0151100096 as a comparison and check stars respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all times of the observation were converted to hjd . </S>",
    "<S> the complete light curves in _ bvri _ bands have been obtained in the night of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of june , 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> new twenty times of minima of the system j1601 have been derived from the present photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we used these times of minima to construct a new ephemeris as follows : ( min i hjd ) = 2456448.36291 ( 4.14552*@xmath7 ) + 0.226593 ( 1.1436*@xmath7 ) * e , with e the integer cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we have been used this new ephemeris to phases our observations . </S>",
    "<S> the software binary maker 3 ( bradstreet 2005 , hereafter bm3 ) has been used to construct the syntactic light curves of the _ bvri _ pass bands for the system j1601 . from the ucac4 catalog ( see zacharias , n. 2012 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ( b - v ) color index of the system j1601 equal 1.13 , which corresponding to effective temperature of the hot component ( @xmath8 ) approximately equal 4680 @xmath9 ( see flower 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light curves of the system j1601 reflect a slightly difference between the two maximums , which mean exhibit a typical oconnell effect ( oconnell 1951 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different solutions , with and without spot on the components were tested with the observations made on @xmath5 june , 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> the various parameters are then tweaked until the theoretical light curves perfectly match the observed ones as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . we derived the degree of over contact ( fillout ) = 22  % , inclination , @xmath10 = @xmath11 , temperature , @xmath8 = 4770 @xmath12 , @xmath13 = 4670 @xmath12 , surface potential , @xmath14 = 3.156404 , mass ratio , @xmath15 = @xmath16 = 0.7 . the same parameters have been employed to display the system configuration at the phases 0.25 , and 0.5 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .          </S>",
    "<S> the _ b _ , _ r _ and _ i _ light curves of the system j1601 have been presented here for the first time , while our _ v _ light curve is the secondary after that of the super wasp . </S>",
    "<S> the solution reveals that the system j1601 is an over contact binary system by 22  % and follow the spot model . for the contact binary system j1601 the categorization of the system may like to be a sub - type of w - uma system , where the primary component star is the hotter and more massive one </S>"
