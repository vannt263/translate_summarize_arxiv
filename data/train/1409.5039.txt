    "for many years people were puzzling over the question if quantum mechanics as the underlying theory to describe non - classical phenomena is complete .",
    "after the einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) paradox@xcite , published in 1935 , it was john steward bell who presented in 1964 a seminal theorem to tackle this question.@xcite he accepted the epr conclusion as a working principle and developed what is called a local hidden variable model ( lhvm ) in which measurement outcomes are completely predetermined and only affected locally .",
    "the assumptions of this model impose linear constraints on experimental input - output correlations in a bipartite system which have become known as bell inequalities .",
    "an important feature in the context of an experimental test of bell s inequality is entanglement@xcite , a quantum mechanical phenomenon which occurs if the state of a particle pair can not be written as independent single particle states .",
    "furthermore , due to entanglement , bell showed that it is impossible to reproduce quantum correlations in the framework of a lhvm which implies a non - local behavior of nature .",
    "but since he assumes in his work perfect correlations , the practical realization of a corresponding experiment is challenging .",
    "for this reason clauser , horn , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) published in 1969 a bell type inequality@xcite which allows to experimentally test a lhvm . only a few years later , in 1972",
    ", the first experiment@xcite in the framework of non - locality tests was performed using entangled photons .",
    "due to the strong resistance against decoherence photon - based systems are ideal for transmitting quantum states over large distances and provide entanglement in different degrees of freedom like their polarization@xcite , transverse or orbital angular momentum ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or energy - time.@xcite towards the end of the century many experiments are engaged in testing the chsh inequality.@xcite in 2002 , the chsh inquality was generalized to what is known today as the collins - gisin - linden - masser - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality@xcite allowing for the investigation of quantum states with dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we present in this work the manifestation of quantum entanglement in bipartite 2-level as well as 3-level systems , also referred to as qubits and qutrits , by using photons entangled in the energy - time domain .",
    "experimentally , we modulate in full coherent control@xcite the photon spectra via a 1-dimensional spatial light modulator ( slm ) allowing us to measure a cglmp bell parameter above the local variable limit for maximally and partially entangled 2-qubit and 2-qutrit states.@xcite the corresponding measurement settings are optimized using the most general su(3 ) unitary transformation .",
    "a cglmp experiment involves two parties renowned as alice ( @xmath1 ) and bob ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "each party performs two different measurements @xmath3 and @xmath4 on a shared 2-qudit state yielding measurement outcomes @xmath5 for alice and @xmath6 for bob .",
    "the total number of possible outcomes thereby depends on the dimension of the distributed quantum state , i.e.  either @xmath7 for qubits or @xmath8 for qutrits . in this way",
    ", a set of joint probabilities @xmath9 can be measured which determines the corresponding bell parameter @xmath10 . if @xmath11 the correlations hidden in the set of joint probabilities can be explained by a lhvm .",
    "whereas for a maximally entangled 2-qubit state the inequality in eq .",
    "is maximally violated by the cirelson bound@xcite , i.e.  @xmath12 , the bell parameter @xmath13 is maximized to @xmath14 by a _ non_-maximally entangled 2-qutrit state.@xcite it is therefore of interest to measure the bell parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 in dependence of a variable degree of entanglement . in the following we thus focus on a 2-qubit state @xmath16 and a 2-qutrit state @xmath17 with a parameter @xmath18 $ ] quantifying the degree of entanglement .",
    "the joint probabilities in eq .   are obtained via projective measurements @xmath19 with @xmath20 and complex coefficients @xmath21 . in order to maximize the bell parameter for each value of @xmath22 , optimal measurement settings @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 ,",
    "were determined by numerical optimization , i.e. @xmath26 in ref .",
    "@xcite , a numerical search and an analytic calculation revealed a maximal violation @xmath27 of the cglmp inequality under the measurement settings first given in ref .",
    "@xcite and a non - maximally entangled 2-qutrit state with @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the corresponding measurement operators refer to a unitary phase operator followed by a symmetric multiport beamsplitter for each party .",
    "we , however , numerically optimize the measurement settings for each @xmath22 incorporating the most general su(3 ) unitary transformation as a measurement bases . for @xmath29 the optimality of the settings can be justified by comparing the value of the optimized bell parameter with the corresponding outcome of the horodecki theorem.@xcite the latter provides the maximal value of the chsh bell parameter for a given biparite qubit state with respect to its bell operator . in the case of @xmath30 no such theorem exists .",
    "the experimental setup can be subdivided into three parts and is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxil ] . by pumping a periodically poled @xmath31 ( ppktp ) crystal with a quasi - monochromatic @xmath32 ( coherent verdi v5 ) laser centered at 532 nm , collinearly phase - matched type-0 spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is exploited . in this way , energy - time entangled photons centered at 1064 nm are prepared with a power of 1.5 @xmath33w and a spectral width of approximately 105 nm .",
    "the corresponding biphoton state can be described by first order perturbation theory @xmath34 where we omit the leading order vacuum state . in general @xmath35",
    "is a non - separable function , denoted as the joint spectral amplitude , and @xmath36 are operators which create the idler ( @xmath37 ) and signal ( @xmath38 ) photon with relative frequency @xmath39 by acting on a combined vacuum state .",
    "note , that in ref .",
    "@xcite the amount of entanglement of a similar state with a pulsed pump field was quantified in the frequency domain by means of an experimentally determined fedorov parameter . in the subsequent manipulation",
    "part , group - velocity dispersion control is established by means of a four - prism compressor , composed of n - sf11 equilateral prisms , which at the same time serves to spatially align the spectrum of the entangled pairs at the symmetry axis of the experimental setup .",
    "a symmetric 2-lens arrangement is used to image the entangled pairs from the center of the spdc crystal to the center of a sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) detection crystal .",
    "the arrangement is such that a magnification factor of 6 is achieved at the slm plane .",
    "the slm ( jenoptik , slm - s640d ) is used to discretize the continuous two - photon state of eq .   into a discrete @xmath40-dimensional subspace spanned by the orthonormal product states",
    "@xmath41 with @xmath42.@xcite thereby , we generally obtain a 2-qudit state @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "experimentally , a discretization scheme is applied on the slm via a complex transfer function @xmath45 where each spectral component of the idler and signal photon can be independently manipulated in amplitude @xmath46 and phase @xmath47 . to obtain a frequency - bin discretization the basis function @xmath48",
    "is chosen according to @xmath49 if we impose for all @xmath50 that @xmath51 , i.e.  adjacent bins do not overlap , and further take into account the continuous wave pump field in the form of a dirac delta function , eq .",
    "is restricted to its diagonal form @xmath52    coincidences are detected through sfg which provides a time window with femtosecond temporal resolution.@xcite the up - converted sfg photons are finally detected by a single photon counting module ( spcm , i d quantique , id100 - 50-uln ) . the measured signal is then described by @xmath53 and is equal to the signal of a projective measurement @xmath54 for a direct product state @xmath55 and @xmath56 of eq .  .    by identifying the idler and signal photon with alice ( @xmath57 ) and bob ( @xmath58 ) , respectively , the probabilities in eq .   are measured by projective measurements according to eq .   with @xmath59 of eq .  .",
    "however , since a sfg process demands a local interaction between the involved photons , the following results can not be considered as a test of the non - local structure of nature .",
    "though , it was shown that the bell parameter related to @xmath60 can be used as an entanglement witness.@xcite as a consequence , the violation of eq",
    ".   signifies entanglement in the 2-qudit state under consideration .",
    "due to the shape of the spdc spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lxil ] ) the state of eq .   entails unequally distributed probability amplitudes and therefore belongs to the class of non - maximally entangled qudit states . in order to experimentally obtain states according to eq .   and",
    "eq .   we first maximize the entanglement by means of the procrustean method of entanglement concentration.@xcite to equate the amplitudes to @xmath61 we discard photon combinations with high probabilities by adjusting the amplitudes @xmath46 of the corresponding frequency bins in the transfer function of eq .  .",
    "after having prepared a maximally entangled state , the reduced entanglement ( @xmath62 ) is then obtained by decreasing the amplitudes @xmath63 of the bins associated with @xmath64 .",
    "the states are first characterized in terms of their density matrices by performing quantum state tomography for various values of @xmath22 .",
    "further , by applying the optimized measurement settings mentioned in section [ sec : cglmp ] , the bell parameters @xmath65 are measured at different degrees of entanglement .",
    "quantum state tomography ( qst ) fully reconstructs a quantum state in terms of its density matrix . to demonstrate the ability of our experimental setup to perform qst we focus on various 2-qutrit states according to eq .  .",
    "the corresponding density matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of generalized gell - mann matrices @xmath66 and the @xmath67-dimensional identity matrix @xmath68.@xcite to determine the coefficients @xmath69 we chose @xmath70 in eq .   according to a tomographically complete set of projective measurements provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to retrieve a positive semidefinite @xmath71 out of the tomographic measurements",
    ", we employ a maximum likelihood estimation method for high dimensional states established in the aforementioned reference . the resulting 2-qutrit density matrices for @xmath72",
    "$ ] are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qstresults ] .",
    "the fidelity@xcite @xmath73 ^ 2 $ ] is calculated with respect to the target density matrix @xmath74 given by the pure state in eq .  .",
    "the 2@xmath75 uncertainties on @xmath76 are calculated through a monte carlo method by randomly adding normally distributed noise to each measurement outcome and recomputing the fidelity .      in order to experimentally determine @xmath77 of eq .   for a specific value of @xmath22 ,",
    "a number of 16 and 36 different projective measurements are required for qubit- and qutrit - based systems , respectively . for various values of @xmath22 , fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] presents experimental data , i.e.  @xmath78 , together with theoretical predictions for the bell parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 using optimized measurements settings .",
    "the theoretical curves are thereby scaled to the experimental data using a symmetric noise model @xmath81 where the mixing parameter @xmath82 and the @xmath40-dimensional identity operator @xmath83 are used .",
    "therefore , deviations from a pure state due to white noise and experimental imperfections can be quantified by @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "the value of the bell parameter for @xmath85 then scales as @xmath86 .",
    "we observe a smaller sensitivity to @xmath22 of the bell parameter for qubits compared to qutrits which is in accordance with theoretical predictions . as discussd , in both systems ,",
    "higher bell parameter values are obtained after optimizing the corresponding experimental settings . to motivate the use of the optimized su(3 ) operators ,",
    "we additionally depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] the bell parameter @xmath80 now optimized with respect to a symmetric multiport beamsplitter combined with a unitary phase operator as discussed in ref .  @xcite ( red dot - dashed line ) . in this case",
    "the measurement settings @xmath87 and @xmath88 to be optimized solely consist of phase angles whereas the full su(3 ) involves also optimized amplitudes in the projection states .",
    "the red dot - dashed line shows the necessity of the su(3 ) optimization procedure since smaller values of the bell parameter are obtained , especially for small @xmath22 , compared to the su(3 ) case ( solid red line ) .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the quantum state reconstruction of maximally and non - maximally entangled qutrits encoded in frequency bins by a slm . the latter provides a versatile tool to manipulate a quantum state which allowed to study the cglmp bell inequality for a 2-qubit and a 2-qutrit state with a variable degree of entanglement .",
    "the bell test measurements presented here can be readily extended to a more general class of qutrits and projection measurements , and , thus , can help to tackle the experiments imposed by the numerical bell test studies in ref .",
    "apart from the cglmp inequality , there exists a more general class of bell inequalities which demands @xmath67-input settings per party instead of only two.@xcite the experimental examination of such a multisetting bell inequality for qutrits is currently under study .",
