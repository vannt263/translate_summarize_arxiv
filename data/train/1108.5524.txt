    "this limit will be important in the discussion of the compositeness .",
    "as before , the condition   relates @xmath23 , @xmath66 , and @xmath36 , so we can characterize the system by ( @xmath66 , @xmath36 ) instead of @xmath79 , keeping the mass of the bound state unchanged . in this case , the interaction strength @xmath23 such that the bound state appears at @xmath66 is calculated as @xmath80 the state with zero binding energy corresponds to the upper limit for the mass of the bound state @xmath81 , which is called _ zero energy resonance _  @xcite .",

    "the residue of this pole is calculated as @xmath86 both the mass and the residue are determined by @xmath87 .",
