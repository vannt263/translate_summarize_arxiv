    "among the planetary auroral radio components in our solar system , jupiter s decametric ( dam ) radiation dominates , having the strongest flux density up to @xmath0 @xmath1 in a frequency range from a few to 40 mhz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "ground - based radio telescopes are limited to observations above 10 mhz due to the effects of the earth s ionosphere .",
    "jovian nonthermal dam radio emission abounds with various kinds of complex frequency structures on the order of milliseconds to tens of seconds @xcite .",
    "these may be classified as short - bursts ( abbreviated as s - bursts ) , which change on a time scale of milliseconds , and long - bursts ( abbreviated as l - bursts ) , which vary with a temporal change of seconds .",
    "the latter can be widely observed in all of jovian dam spectrum , while the former is seen in a part of the dam spectrum classified as io - related dam ( io - dam ) because of a strong influence of the galilean moon io @xcite .",
    "earth - based radio observatories detect the io - dam cone emissions @xcite when the cones are centered on the jovian dawn and dusk sides ; the former is further classified as io - b and -d , and the latter as io - a and -c .",
    "these cone emissions result from the electron cyclotron maser instability @xcite , where the wave - particle interaction in the strong magnetized plasma of jupiter s poles produces the right - hand extraordinary ( r - x ) mode radiation near the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "therefore , the sources of the io - a and -b and of the io - c and -d are believed to be located in jovian northern and southern polar regions , respectively .",
    "long baseline analyses of common jovian s - bursts have been carried out , using various baselines from 1200 to 6980 km and frequency coverages of 22 to 34 mhz @xcite .",
    "@xcite first attempted to measure the arrival time of s - bursts at 34 mhz using the two 0.31-second s - burst events from radio telescopes in boulder , colorado , and clark lake , california ( i.e. 1200 km apart ) .",
    "it was , however , inconclusive due to a lack of recorded time accuracy .",
    "later @xcite analyzed the 6-second period of a train of 68 s - bursts over a 6980 km baseline at 18 mhz , insisting that all of them were simultaneously emanated from jupiter within a north - south view of about 1.8 \" .",
    "in contrast to the single spectral channel monitoring , the three events of synchronized jovian s - bursts in a few second period show good correlation in a frequency range of 22 to 26 mhz between radio telescopes in nanay , france , and kharkiv , ukraine @xcite , but it was not well - discriminated between two different wavefront arrival times because of both the accuracy of temporal sampling and relatively short baseline of about 3000 km .        the purpose of this paper is to present the results of a detailed cross - correlation analysis of jovian s - bursts in a 105-minute duration observation obtained using three interferometers spanning a maximum baseline of 8460 km .",
    "we measure an angular size of the beam of 2.66 \" , thereby suggesting this cone thickness along the east - west direction .",
    "also , new statistical s - bursts properties regarding the observed frequency of 10 to 33 mhz are investigated .",

    "the simultaneous observations of jovian radio bursts were made at the long wavelength array station one ( lwa1 ) on the plains of san agustin , new mexico , usa , at the nanay decameter array ( nda ) in nanay , france , and at the uran2 radio telescope in poltava , ukraine .",
    "all of the three radio telescopes are capable of measuring the full stokes parameters , but only the stokes i is used in this study .",
    "a number of antennas , respectively , comprise 256 bow - tie dipoles for lwa1 @xcite , 144 conical helices for nda @xcite , and 512 cross dipoles for uran2 @xcite .",

    "overall , the overlapped frequency of lwa1/drx , nda / routine , and uran2/dsp - z ranges from 10.2 to 33 mhz , which covers most of the full spectra of jupiter s radio bursts .",

    "the jovian central meridian longitude ( cml ) ranged from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and io was at @xmath5@xmath6 from superior geocentric conjunction . concerning the three possible telescope pairs , the nda - uran2 , lwa1-nda , and lwa1-uran2",
    "pairs , the angular size in the east - west direction and effective baseline are listed in table [ table : obs_para ] . in short ,",
    "the effective baseline covers from 0 to 8460 km along which the east - west angular size varies as a view from jupiter , varies from @xmath2 `` to 2.66 '' .",
    "it is obvious that the similar jovian radio io - d / b structures are seen for all of the radio telescopes .",

    "although the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) method was applied to jupiter s s - bursts @xcite , the cross - correlation analysis of the s - burst dynamic spectrum in a few second period was performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , one of the differences is that the data format for the vlbi method are stored with waveform voltage induced from the antennas and the dynamic spectrum data are fourier - transformed spectral data ( i.e. stokes i ) derived from the vlbi data . in this study , we have extended the cross - correlation analysis to the lwa1-nda - uran2 spectrograms with which the sampling step varies with both temporal and spectral resolution .    in the resampling process , we average the observed values related to the stokes i at each station over a spectral resolution of 50 khz , and then resample the obtained values with a common fixed temporal resolution of 1 ms by means of a cubic interpolation called the catmull - rom spline .",
    "we compute the frequency - dependent cross - correlation function @xmath8 , which can be described as @xmath9 \\left(\\tau \\ge 0\\right ) \\\\ & = & \\displaystyle \\sum_t \\left [ \\left(x_f \\left(t+|\\tau|\\right)-\\bar{x}_f \\right)\\cdot \\left ( y_f \\left(t\\right)-\\bar{y}_f\\right)\\right ] \\left(\\tau < 0\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variables are defined as follows : @xmath10 , shifted temporal variable ( lag time ) ; t , temporal variable in one - second period ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 , observed stokes i for each frequency in db in a pair of either nda - uran2 , lwa1-nda , or lwa1-uran2 ; and @xmath13 and @xmath14 , mean values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . note that a positive @xmath10 is when the time of @xmath11 is more delayed than the time of @xmath12 and vice versa .",
    "measuring accurate arriving times at each station is a key to extract a nature of the s - bursts .",
    "the lwa1 and nda recorded the timing ( inserted from gps synchronized clock time ) and sampled a constant temporal cycle with an accuracy of better than 1 ms .",
    "however the uran2 s initial timing was compromised due to set - up not being on gps but dps - z internal time . in order to approximately correct the uran2 s timing ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the nda and uran2 artificial - noise - free spectrograms from 10.20 to 10.45 mhz in a 50 khz interval .",
    "this contains approximately the same amount of propagation lag time , about a few milliseconds from both jovian s - bursts and the sweeping signals from the european ionosonde stations @xcite . after adjusting the corrected lag time for the uran2 data",
    ", we investigate the trend of lag times in a pair of the nda - uran2 , lwa1-nda , and lwa1-uran2 in a wide frequency range of 1033 mhz .",
    "an example of the cross - correlation spectrum is shown in figure [ figs : plot_lwa - nda - uran2]f by cross - correlating the dominant intensity of s - bursts from lwa1 in figure [ figs : plot_lwa - nda - uran2]d and nda in figure [ figs : plot_lwa - nda - uran2]e . in this case , the lag time ( @xmath15 ) is 4 ms when the cross - correlation functions are highest .",
    "we have applied this technique to find @xmath15 , and the mean ( @xmath16 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath8 in one - second periods for each frequency ; the total number of computations for @xmath15 amount to about seventeen - billion points ( more precisely , 457 spectral channels @xmath18 6300 one - second periods @xmath18 1999 one - millisecond lag time steps @xmath18 3 telescope pairs ) . note that , in order to discard quasi - random background fluctuations , we keep datum points only if @xmath8 of the lag time is above the threshold of @xmath16 + @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a 99.5% confidence interval of a gaussian distribution .    after collecting representative lag times and corresponding cross - correlation functions for each frequency in a bin of 1 ms , we compute the mean cross - correlation functions in each bin that are defined by a sum of cross - correlation functions over a total number of observed counts . in order to remove temporal changes in data reception",
    ", we impose a condition where the observed counts in a bin are above 4 points ( 1% of total spectral channels ) .",
    "figure [ fig : x - lwa1-nda - uran2 ] shows a final form of the mean cross - correlation functions depicted as a function of elapsed time from 02:00:30 ut and lag time .        in accounting for the observed lag times",
    ", we may test the validation of two different beaming models either ( 1 ) flashlight - like or ( 2 ) beacon - like beaming as drawn in figure [ fig : beaming ] . in the case of model 1",
    ", the radio sources at jupiter are located in a wide longitude and isotropically emitted to observers , while model 2 means that the sources are localized in specific longitudes , rotating in longitude about the jovian magnetic axis . in order to distinguish these two models , it is convenient to compute the propagation differential time vector @xmath21 between two stations and the rotation lag time vector @xmath22 , where each vector composes three independent components from the nda - uran2 , lwa1-nda , and lwa1-uran2 pairs in sequence",
    ". therefore , we may describe the estimated lag time of model 1 ( @xmath23 ) and model 2 ( @xmath24 ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the offset lag time vector and , when @xmath27 is the propagation differential time of the nda - uran2 pair , it is equal to [ @xmath28 , 15 , @xmath29 $ ] in ms .",
    "this is because we approximately corrected the same time at nda and uran2 and intentionally inserted positive 15 ms lag time to the lwa1 time stamp .",
    "the trend of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are superimposed as the white solid and dotted lines , respectively , in figure [ fig : x - lwa1-nda - uran2 ] .",
    "the white solid lines reasonably fit to the trend of the lag time when the mean cross - correlation functions are relatively high .",
    "there is a small scattered area in the initial phase of the lwa1-uran2 pair in figure [ fig : x - lwa1-nda - uran2]e until 02:04 ut with the angular size of 2.66 `` .",
    "this is due to relatively high background noise after the sunset on the lwa1 site .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to conclude that the beaming thickness has a minimum beaming thickness of 2.66 '' in the east - west direction projected on jupiter .",
    "it is important to note that the sharp peak of the mean cross - correlation functions appears at 0 ms lag time because of similar long - scale fluctuation of the background noises ( such as artificial interference and jovian l - bursts ) but the occurrence probability of the background noises is less than 4 % of the total observed time .",
    "nevertheless , these long - scale effects may be easily removed for the s - burst s analysis if we purposely add adequate offset lag time in either pair of telescopes ( i.e. our case was positive 15 ms for the lwa1 data ) .    in qualitatively estimating the occurrence of s - bursts within the io - d / b , we integrate a number of occurrences appearing in the surrounded area of yellow lines for @xmath30 ms of the lwa1-nda and for @xmath31 ms of the lwa1-uran2 .",
    "figure [ fig : oc_s - bursts ] shows a plot of the occurrence probability histogram as a function of observed frequency in a pair of lwa1-nda ( orange ) and lwa1-uran2 ( blue ) . the yellow lines in figure [ fig : x - lwa1-nda - uran2 ] are reflected with the accumulated technical error of timing .",
    "the occurrence probability tends to rapidly increase from 10 to 17 - 18 mhz and then gradually decrease to 33 mhz .",
    "this may result from the fact that the low - frequency part corresponds to the io - d s - bursts and the high - frequency part dominates within the io - b s - bursts .",
    "conventionally , the discrimination between s- and l - bursts are made by inspecting the observed dynamic spectrum by eye ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or only in the individual s - burst case by computer @xcite , while our cross - correlation method is simple but efficient to estimate occurrence probability for s - bursts , which includes both simple and complex spectral variation .    ) based on the cross - correlation analysis plotted as a function of frequency . ]",
    "in this paper we report the continuous appearance of s - bursts in a wide frequency band of 10 to 33 mhz over east - west baselines from 0 to 8460 km with the combination of three radio telescopes , namely , the lwa1 in usa , the nda in france , and the uran2 in ukraine . by taking into account the angular size of each pair for the common s - bursts",
    ", the beaming tends to come from the same direction of jupiter with a minimum cone thickness of 2.66 \" .",
    "furthermore , the technique of cross - correlating spectral density obtained from multiple stations used in this study also yields a practical benefit of producing the statistical profiles of s - bursts .",
    "we find that the occurrence probability is highest at 17 - 18 mhz .",
    "many theoretical studies concerning the generation of jovian s - bursts consider different wave - particle interactions that occur along the io flux tube ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the individual s - burst",
    ", the most accepted theory is that a group of upward - moving electrons acts an adiabatic motion along the active magnetic field lines near io , thereby converting released energy into s - bursts via the electron cyclotron maser instability @xcite .",
    "our result from one observing direction implies two kinds of possible scenarios of s - burst mechanism .",
    "first case is the short duration of radiation having isotropic wide beaming .",
    "second case is the long duration of radio emission with a confined narrow beam , thereby suggesting that the beam size depends upon an observed event s duration and the rotation period of the bodies of interest such as io and jupiter . by comparing the measurements of the wavefront arrival times from several observing directions",
    ", the ambiguity of two cases can be solved .",
    "thus , our proposed cross - correlation method applied to more combined and extended observations with distant telescopes , may provide an insight into a better understanding of the s - burst mechanism .",
