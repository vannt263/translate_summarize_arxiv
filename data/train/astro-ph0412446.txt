    "over the past six years evidence has mounted that long - duration ( @xmath0 s ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) signal the collapse of massive stars in our universe .",
    "this evidence was originally based on the probable association of the unusual grb 980425 with a type ib / c supernova ( sn ; galama et al .",
    "1998 ) but now includes the association of grbs with regions of massive star formation in distant galaxies ( paczyski 1998 ; wijers et al . 1998 ; fruchter et al . 1999 ; djorgovski et  al . 2001",

    "2002 ) , and the first convincing spectroscopic evidence that a very energetic supernova ( a hypernova ) was temporally and spatially coincident with a grb ( hjorth et al . 2003 ; stanek et al .",
    "these observations support the idea that long - duration grbs are associated with the deaths of massive stars , presumably arising from core collapse ( woosley 1993 , zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "an implication of a massive star progenitor is that the circumburst environment is determined by the mass - loss wind from the star .",
    "much of our effort in this paper will therefore be dedicated to determining the state of the circumburst material in various types of progenitor scenarios , and describing how this external matter can affect grb jets propagating through it .",
    "it should be noted here that the afterglows sample a region @xmath1 cm in size . because massive stars are expected to have their close - in surroundings modified by the progenitor winds , we consider both free winds and shocked winds as possible surrounding media for the afterglow stage . detailed hydrodynamic simulations of this interaction are presented in  4 .",
    "our computations allow us , for the first time , to study the behaviour of circumstellar gas very close to the progenitor star .",
    "an understanding of the evolution of a gas - dynamic jet can come only through a knowledge of the properties of the medium which it propagates .",
    "calculations of the evolution of a relativistic , gas - dynamic jet and expected emission properties are discussed in  5 . for completeness ,",
    "the interactions with either a free wind or a constant density medium , as well as the termination shock wave which marks the transition between these two media , are discussed in  2 and  3 .",
    "the role of binarity is briefly addressed in  4.1 .",
    "we then in  6 discuss the possible variety of afterglow variability that is expected from grb jets expanding in a medium that may be inhomogeneous because of clumping in the wolf - rayet ( wr ) star wind .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in  7 .",
    "if the progenitors are massive stars then there is an analogy to the explosions of core collapse supernovae , for which there is abundant evidence that they interact with the winds from the progenitor stars . in most supernova cases ,",
    "the radial range that is observed is only out to a few pc , such that the mass loss characteristics have not changed significantly during the time that mass is supplied to the wind ( chevalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "the density in the wind depends on the type of progenitor .",
    "red supergiant stars , which are thought to be the progenitors of type ii supernovae , have slow dense winds .",
    "wolf - rayet stars , which are believed to be the progenitors of type ib / c supernovae and possibly of grbs ( e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , have faster , lower - density winds .",
    "the winds from typical red supergiants are slow - moving and dense , with velocities @xmath2 km s@xmath3 and mass loss rates between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( e.g. fransson et al .",
    "1996 ) . the winds from wrs , on the other hand , are characterized by mass - loss rates @xmath6 and velocities @xmath7 ( e.g. chiosi & maeder 1986 ) . in a steady , spherically symmetric wind ,",
    "the electron density is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the molecular weight per electron and @xmath10 in a helium gas .",
    "here @xmath11 , @xmath12 cm , and @xmath13 .",
    "for this discussion we shall assume the blast wave is adiabatic , i.e. its energy is constant with time , and effectively spherical .",
    "this means the @xmath14 here is the isotropic equivalent energy as , for example , derived from the gamma - ray output .",
    "deceleration due to the stellar wind starts in earnest when about half the initial energy is transferred to the shocked matter , i.e. when it has swept up @xmath15 times its own rest mass .",
    "the typical mass where this happens is @xmath16 the relativistic expansion is then gradually slowed down , and the blast wave evolves in a self - similar manner with a power - law lightcurve .",
    "this phase ends when so much mass shares the energy that the lorentz factor , @xmath17 , drops to 1 .",
    "obviously , this happens when a mass @xmath18 has been swept up .",
    "this sets a non - relativistic mass scale @xmath19 beyond this point , the event slowly changes into a classical sedov - taylor supernova remnant evolution , leading to a steeper decline in the lightcurve ( waxman et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the unshocked wind , the mass within radius @xmath20 is @xmath21 , which combined with equation ( [ eqn : mdec ] ) gives the blast wave deceleration radius in a stellar wind : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ergs .",
    "by contrast , the well - known expression for the uniform - medium deceleration radius is @xmath24 and so a blast wave in a wind decelerates at a much smaller radius .",
    "the deceleration time is given by @xmath25 in both cases , and thus is correspondingly smaller for the wind case .",
    "however , because the lorentz factor decreases as @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 being the swept - up mass ) beyond this point , the mass - starved wind blast wave decelerates much more slowly , and therefore begins to catch up .",
    "there is therefore not much difference in size between wind and uniform cm blast waves in the most commonly observed interval from 0.3 to 10 days after the burst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : am ] ) . usually in the study of afterglows ,",
    "one considers either the uniform ambient medium case or the @xmath28 wind case on its own .",
    "however , since the wind of a star meets the interstellar medium ( ism ) at some point , the density structure is more complex , and it is to this problem that we now turn our attention .",
    "during the evolution of a wind - driven circumstellar shell the system has a four - zone structure ( analogous to that of a supernova shell ; woltjer 1972 ) .",
    "from the inside to the outside these zones are : ( a ) a supersonic stellar wind with density @xmath29 ; ( b ) a hot , almost isobaric region consisting of shocked stellar wind mixed with a small fraction of the swept - up interstellar gas ; ( c ) a thin , dense , cold shell containing most of the swept - up interstellar gas ; ( d ) ambient interstellar gas of number density @xmath30 ( fig . [ fig : sd ] ) .",
    "+ the wind initially expands unopposed into the ism with a velocity of about @xmath31 , the escape velocity at the sonic point .",
    "the free expansion phase is considered to be terminated at a time @xmath32 , when the swept - up mass of the interstellar medium is comparable to the mass in the wind .",
    "the mass lost by the star is @xmath33 and the swept - up mass is @xmath34 .",
    "these two masses are equal when @xmath35^{1/2}$ ] , which is about 100 years for a typical wr wind expanding into an homogeneous ism .",
    "the free - expansion phase takes place at the early stages of the evolution of the hot star and occupies a minimal fraction of its lifetime . during this time",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are approximately constant , and the wind bubble has reached a radius of @xmath38 , where @xmath36 is the mass loss rate in units of solar masses per year , and @xmath30 is the density of the surrounding medium in units of @xmath39 .",
    "when the free - expansion phase ( a ) has ended , the wind encounters an inward facing shock .",
    "kinetic energy is deposited in the shocked wind region in the form of heat , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the relative speed of the material approaching the shock .",
    "thus , a jump in velocity by @xmath42 km s@xmath3 , which is still well below typical terminal wind speeds , produces a @xmath43 k gas in the shocked wind region . during phase ( b ) , the material is so hot that it causes the contact surface to expand outward more slowly than it would in a freely expanding wind .",
    "the ism that enters the outward facing shock is heated to a temperature below @xmath44 , emission of line radiation becomes the dominant cooling process and the swept - up gas cools quickly to temperatures of about @xmath45 that can be maintained by the radiation field of the star .",
    "the duration of the adiabatic expansion phase can thus be estimated by finding the time it takes the expanding gas to cool from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . using equation ( [ eqn : tshock ] )",
    ", we find that a change in temperature from @xmath48 to @xmath47 corresponds to a change in jump velocity by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "this change in jump velocity corresponds to a phase ( b):(a ) age ratio of about  6 ( castor et al . 1975 ) .",
    "thus , the age of the adiabatic phase is less than about 1000 years .",
    "the mass of the swept - up material is much larger than that in the hot wind and , because it is cool , it lies in a compressed region .",
    "phase ( c ) persists for as long as the star is able to sustain a powerful wind .",
    "the dominant energy loss of region ( b ) is work against the compressed region ( c ) .",
    "the compressed region ( c ) expands because its gas pressure is higher than that of the surrounding ism .",
    "therefore , the expansion is described by the momentum equation , @xmath50=4\\pi r^2(t ) p_{\\rm i } , \\label{eqn : momeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the internal pressure of the compressed region , assuming that most of the swept - up interstellar mass remains in the thin shell .",
    "@xmath52 is the mass of the shell of swept - up material , given by @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath51 is determined by the gas pressure of the high temperature gas in region ( b ) .",
    "the wind material that enters the backward - facing shock is hot , but the material that enters the forward - facing shock is cool .",
    "the cooled swept - up material is driven outward by the high gas pressure of the hot bubble .",
    "the stellar wind adds energy to region ( b ) at a rate @xmath54 the internal energy in the bubble is given by the product of the energy per unit mass of the material , @xmath55 , and the total mass of the bubble , @xmath56 . since the total internal energy of the bubble comes from the energy of the wind , we find @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the expansion of the bubble during the adiabatic phase can be found numerically by using this expression in the momentum equation .",
    "if the wind power @xmath58 is roughly constant for a period of time , @xmath59 , one can write @xmath60 . the resulting solution of equation ( [ eqn : momeq ] ) gives @xmath61 .",
    "this shows that the shell expands more slowly than would a freely expanding wind .",
    "since the gas in the cavity moves subsonically its pressure keeps it approximately at uniform density .",
    "the bubble could continue to expand until stalled by the pressure of the ism ( garca - segura & franco 1996 ) .",
    "the radius of the wind termination shock at the inner edge of the wind bubble can be found by balancing the wind ram pressure with the post - shock cavity pressure . for a star that loses mass at a rate @xmath62 with a wind velocity @xmath63 km s@xmath3 in interstellar gas with density @xmath64 , we have a inner termination shock radius @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the lifetime of the star in myr . the density in the uniform shocked wind region , @xmath67 , at late times",
    "is given by @xmath68 which shows that even if the progenitor star is embedded in a dense molecular cloud the observed blast wave can propagate in a low - density , uniform medium ( wijers 2001 ) .",
    "the mass within the @xmath69 wind , @xmath70 , is @xmath71 comparison with estimates given in soderberg & ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 ) show that if the wind is particularly weak ( i.e. @xmath72 ) or the surrounding density is high ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 falls within the range of the relativistic expansion .",
    "models and observations of galactic wolf - rayet stars , however , show that the swept - up shell of a red supergiant material at the outer radius is at a distance @xmath75 pc from the star ( garca - segura et al .",
    "this radius is sufficiently large that the interaction with the free @xmath28 wind is expected over the typical period of observation of afterglows .    among the afterglows that can be interpreted as interaction with a undisturbed stellar wind , the highest density objects are compatible with expectations for the wind from a typical wolf - rayet star ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , but",
    "the lower densities imply a wind densities that are lower by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "as proposed by wijers ( 2001 ) , the low - density requirement may be alleviated by appealing to a shocked wind , but the observable afterglow transitions due to the blast wave traversing the wind termination shock wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] ) have not been seen in any afterglow .",
    "depending upon the wind history of a massive star during its last few centuries , however , the density structure in this inner region ( i.e. relevant to the afterglow phase ) could be quite complicated as the star enters advanced burning stages unlike those in any wolf - rayet star observed so far .",
    "the non - steady nature of the winds in massive stars therefore leaves open the possibility of interaction with denser material at early times ( chevalier et al .",
    "this encourages us to present a detailed account of the large and small scale features that may be present in the circumstellar gas distribution .",
    "these features , as we argue , can result naturally when one takes into account the complete mass - loss history of a massive star .",
    "the detailed dynamical evolution of the circumstellar material ( csm ) around massive stars is complex .",
    "some stages of it do not involve major hydrodynamical instabilities and can thus be studied analytically by means of self - similar solutions ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; ostriker & mckee 1988 ; chevalier & liang 1989 ; garca - segura & mac low 1995a ) .",
    "however , the frequent occurrence of instabilities requires two  or three  dimensional hydrodynamic calculations in order to follow the non - linear evolution of the resulting structures ( franco et al .",
    "1991 ; blondin & lundquist 1993 ; garca - segura & mac low 1995b ) .    in an effort to achieve full consistency between stellar and circumstellar evolution",
    ", we have performed several computations where the time - dependent input for the calculation of the circumstellar gas dynamics is derived from the output of a stellar evolution code developed at the university of gttingen ( langer et al .",
    "1988 , langer 1991 ) . here",
    "we carry out computational simulations with the hydrocode zeus-3d ( version 3.4 ) developed by m. l. norman and the laboratory for computational astrophysics .",
    "zeus-3d is a finite - difference , fully explicit , eulerian code ( clarke 1996 ) descended from the code described by stone & norman ( 1992 ) .",
    "we used spherical coordinates for our simulations , with a symmetry axis at the pole , and reflecting boundary conditions at the equator and the polar axis .",
    "the reader is referred to garca - segura et  al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) for a review of the applied computational methods and techniques .",
    "the preburst stellar wind depends on the evolutionary stages prior to ( and during ) the wolf - rayet stage . for galactic stars ,",
    "a standard evolutionary track is to start as an o star , evolve through a red supergiant ( rsg ) phase or luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase with considerable mass loss , and ending as a wolf - rayet star ( garca - segura et  al .",
    "1996a , b ) . at low metallicity ,",
    "the rsg phase may be absent ; this may also be the case for some binary stars .",
    "as a first example , we follow the dynamics of the circumstellar medium around a 29 @xmath77 star at the zams , which evolves ( at solar metallicity ) through a long - lived rsg stage with prominent consequences for the evolution of the circumstellar matter .",
    "the 29 @xmath77 stellar model has steady winds during the main - sequence ( ms ) and rsg stages .",
    "for that reason , the csm evolution during these stages is computed in one dimension for a homogeneous ism .",
    "for the calculation of the post - rsg evolution the variables such as the temperatures and density are extrapolated onto a two dimensional grid .",
    "note , however , that the calculations start before the rsg phase has ended in order to be sure that the rsg shell is dynamically stable .",
    "the total amount of mass lost by the rsg in the wind is @xmath78 , with a mass loss rate @xmath79 and wind velocity @xmath80 km s@xmath3 .",
    "when the fast wr wind @xmath81 km s@xmath3 starts blowing , it sweeps up the rsg wind material into a shell , which we will refer to as the _",
    "wr shell_. the properties of this shell turn out to be very sensitive to the characteristics of the rsg wind .",
    "since the density of the rsg wind depends on its velocity as @xmath82 , a low rsg wind velocity implies a much higher density .",
    "the expansion of the wr shell is faster for lower rsg wind densities and also for higher wind velocities .",
    "the termination shock of the wr wind is located at a much smaller radius than that of the hot ms bubble described in the previous section , so we simply assume free outflow as the outer boundary condition in order to calculate its dynamical behaviour ( garca - segura et al .",
    "1996a ) .    during the early stages ,",
    "the swept - up wr shell is dense enough to be fully radiative .",
    "this ceases to be true , however , after the shell has extended to a radius of more than 0.1 pc , since its density decreases so much that its evolution becomes almost adiabatic .",
    "correspondingly , the shell is initially thin and therefore subject to vishniac instabilities ( vishniac 1983 ) ; but the increase of shell thickness soon suppresses the growth of the instability .",
    "this instability operates in dense winds where the cooling is effective enough to produce radiative terminal shocks .",
    "the rsg wind shell is accelerated by the ( less dense ) shocked wr wind and is therefore also subject to rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and vishniac instabilities . in this case",
    "we have a radiatively - cooled , thin , accelerated shell and the two instabilities must be coupled .",
    "the resulting structure after 8,000 yr of evolution since the onset of the wr phase is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] .",
    "it is also possible for a fast wr wind to collide with early ejecta before it is decelerated by the rsg shell ( or a lbv shell depending on the evolutionary pathway of the massive progenitor ) . to illustrate this , we study the last ( unsteady ) wr stage of a 60 @xmath77 star .",
    "mass loss lowers the stellar mass from 60 @xmath77 all the way down to @xmath83 at the time of the final supernova ( or grb ) .",
    "the total mass loss includes @xmath84 lost in the ms and pre - lbv stages , @xmath85 lost in the lbv stage , and @xmath86 in the wr stage .",
    "the ms and lbv - wr stages have been modeled in a self - consistent fashion by garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996b ) .",
    "these stages have important implications for the circumstellar gas at @xmath87 pc . here",

    "the resultant shell will be pushed outward by the central star wind and retarded by the early ejected wind , quickly reaching a constant velocity , but increasing in mass .",
    "the resulting expansion law for the shell follows from the momentum balance between the two components . the analytical theory of kwok et al .",
    "( 1978 ) can give some insight into the problem .",
    "if @xmath90 is the mass of the resulting shell when it is at a radial distance @xmath91 , then @xmath92 where @xmath93 . if @xmath94 is the velocity of the shell , then , assuming a completely inelastic collision , the equation of motion may be written @xmath95 ^ 2 - { \\dot{m}_j \\over v_j}[v_j - v_{ij}]^2",
    "\\label{eqn : mijwind}\\ ] ] numerical integration of equation ( [ eqn : mijwind ] ) , with a substitution for @xmath96 from equation ( [ eqn : mijw ] ) gives the resulting expansion law for the shell .",
    "the thickness of the shell @xmath97 may be found by requiring its internal pressure to balance the pressure from the wind .",
    "such large expansion velocities @xmath41 produce high temperatures ( see equation [ eqn : tshock ] ) in the post - shock region behind the outer shock of the merged shell .",
    "this high post - shock temperature and the low density ( i.e. low @xmath98 and high @xmath99 ) of the wr wind result in an almost adiabatic , hot , low - density wr shell .",
    "figure [ fig : rot ] shows the morphology of the smooth wr ring under the assumption that the central star experiences non - spherical mass loss close to critical rotation : in other words , a scenario in which a slower and denser wind is confined to the equatorial plane . to compute the latitudinal dependence of the wind properties of a star close to critical rotation ideally requires multi - dimensional models of the star and its outflowing atmosphere , which are not available .",
    "langer ( 1998 ) , however , argued that the stellar flux and the radius might still vary only weakly from pole to the equator in very luminous stars .",
    "we therefore applied equations similar to those found by bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) for winds of rotating stars in the limit of large distance from the star : @xmath100 where we set the parameters defined in bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 being mass and radius of the star , and @xmath107 standing for the ratio @xmath108 of stellar to eddington luminosity ( langer et al .",
    "1998 ) . under the above conditions",
    ", the wind expands more quickly and easily into the lower density wind at the poles , while stellar rotation concentrates it toward the equatorial plane , producing a double - lobed structure . in section ",
    "5 we aim to examine the interaction of the relativistic blast wave with these more _ realistic _ density wind profiles .",
    "+      one of the most important questions relating to wr stars is whether they are all members of binary systems or rather do some truly single objects exist .",
    "possibly a large fraction of stars are members of binary or multiple systems but most are sufficiently far from their companions that their evolution proceeds essentially as if they were single stars .",
    "however there is an important minority of stars which are close enough that their evolution is dramatically changed by the presence of a companion .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that the progenitors of grbs are just very massive , single wr stars .",
    "special circumstances are almost certainly needed .",
    "the most promising of these is rotation : a rapidly rotating core is the essential ingredient in the `` collapsar '' model for grbs ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "massive stars are generally rapid rotators on the main sequence . however , there are many well - established mechanisms by which they can lose their angular momentum during their evolution .",
    "thus , it is not at all clear whether the cores of massive single stars will ever be rotating rapidly at the time of explosion ( e.g. heger et al . 2005 ) . the simplest way to generate",
    "the required angular momentum is for the core to reside in a tight binary and be in corotation with the binary .",
    "izzard et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using detailed binary population calculations , concluded that there are enough binaries where tidal locking could account for the observed grb rates .",
    "most companions , being low - mass ms stars , have small mass - loss rates and are thus unlikely to enhance significantly the density around the grb progenitor . the density structure seen around wr 147 ( contreras & rodriguez 1999 ) could be a hint of what exists in some grb progenitors .",
    "overall , we do not expect binarity to significant alter the circumstellar gas density profiles along the rotation axis of the collapsing stellar core .",
    "there is , however , a small , interesting subclass of binaries in which the companion star may be massive ( see e.g. izzard et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this case",
    ", the wr star mass loss may also be influenced by the winds of the close binary companion .",
    "detailed computations are needed to show the magnitude of the effect .",
    "the requirement that the total core angular momentum exceed the maximum angular momentum of a kerr black hole places interesting limits on the binary period ( izzard et al . 2004 ; podsiadlowski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that the binary is circular , and model the core as an @xmath109 polytrope",
    ". then the binary period must be smaller than @xmath110 h. this orbit could be tight enough that the core may in fact have been stripped of its helium in a common envelope to form a co core . alternatively , it may sometimes happen that the core of a very massive star retains the required angular momentum as its outer hydrogen layers are blown off in a stellar wind . indeed , brown & bethe ( 1994 ) have noted that the cores of stars more massive than @xmath111 will undergo a delayed collapse to form a black hole if the nuclear equation of state is soft .",
    "prompt formation of a black hole introduces a mechanism for failure of a core collapse supernova , if success of the shock depends on delayed neutrino heating .",
    "the corresponding rate of kerr hole formation depends , of course , on the physics of angular momentum transport inside the progenitor star .",
    "the required spin could also be generated when the core mergers with a binary companion during common envelope phase .",
    "so perhaps one important distinction between a grb and an ordinary supernovae is whether a black hole or a neutron star is formed in the aftermath .",
    "however , not all black hole formation events can lead to a grb : if the minimum mass of a single star that leads to the formation of a black hole is as low as @xmath112 , this would overproduce grb by a large factor ( see izzard et al . 2004 ) .",

    "the shocked material is extremely hot and , therefore , @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "for @xmath134 the equations governing the shocks are ( bm ) @xmath135 @xmath136 the approximations in equation ( [ eqn : shock1 ] ) use only the fact that @xmath137 and therefore @xmath138 .",
    "no assumption is made about @xmath139 , the lorentz factor of the motion of the shocked material in region ( 3 ) relative to the unshocked shell in region ( 4 ) .",
    "equality of pressures and velocities along the contact discontinuity yields @xmath140 the solution for @xmath141 depends only on two parameters , @xmath125 and @xmath142 .",
    "the energy , pressure , and density also depend linearly on a third parameter , the external density @xmath143 ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "there are two simple limits of equations ( [ eqn : shock1])-([eqn : shock3 ] ) in which the reverse shock is either newtonian or ultra relativistic ( the forward shock is always ultra relativistic if @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) . if @xmath146 , the reverse shock is ultra relativistic ( @xmath147 ) : @xmath148 in this case almost all of the initial kinetic energy is converted by the shocks into internal energy ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the process therefore is over after a single passage of the reverse shock through the ejecta ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "if @xmath150 the reverse shock is newtonian @xmath151 and @xmath152 the reverse shock converts only a fraction @xmath153 of the kinetic energy into internal energy .",
    "it is too weak to slow down the ejecta effectively , and most of the initial energy is still kinetic energy when this shock reaches the inner edge of the ejecta . at this stage",
    "a rarefraction wave begins to propagate toward the contact discontinuity .",
    "this wave propagates at the speed of sound @xmath154 and it reaches the contact discontinuity at @xmath155 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the shock crossing time . here",
    "@xmath156 is the width ( in the observer s frame ) of the relativistic shell . the rarefraction wave is then reflected from the contact discontinuity and a second , weaker , shock wave forms .",
    "a quasi - steady state slowing down solution forms after a few crossing like this ( sari & piran 1995 ) . using momentum conservation , the total slowing down time can be estimated by @xmath157 . during this time",
    "the forward shock collects a fraction @xmath15 of the shell s rest mass . in contrary to the relativistic case , there are two relevant timescales now : the rarefraction or shock crossing time and the total slowing down timescale .    in any realistic situation",
    "the cm is probably inhomogeneous , as in the stellar models described in the previous section .",
    "consider a density jump by a factor @xmath158 over a distance @xmath159 .",
    "the forward shock propagates into the cm with a density @xmath143 as before , and when it reaches the position where the cm density is @xmath160 a new shock wave is reflected .",
    "this shock is reflected again off the shell . as discussed above , the reflections time is about @xmath161 , and after these reflections , the lorentz factor and hydrodynamical properties of the system are as if the cm were homogeneous with a density @xmath160 .",
    "if the reverse shock converts only a small fraction of the kinetic energy into thermal energy , then the forward shock expands almost at the velocity of the previous blast wave . in the relativistic case , however , considerable deceleration may occur before @xmath162 unless @xmath163 .",
    "the peak of synchrotron emission occurs at frequency @xmath164 and the frequency integrated emissivity is given by @xmath165 ; where @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 are electron charge , mass , and thermal lorentz factor , respectively , @xmath169 is the magnetic field in the fluid rest frame ( assumed to be amplified up to a fraction @xmath170 by the processes in the shocked region and not determined directly by the field in the wr star ) , @xmath171 is the electron number density , and @xmath172 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "the emission at low frequencies ( @xmath173 ) scales as @xmath174 and at high frequencies ( @xmath175 ) it scales as @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the power - law index for the energy distribution of electrons .",
    "the ratio of the peak synchrotron frequencies , before and after the forward shock has traversed a density jump of a factor @xmath158 over a distance @xmath159 , is @xmath178^{2 } \\approx \\alpha^{-1/4}.\\ ] ] therefore , we expect this emission to be a significant contribution to the long - wavelength flux .",
    "the ratio of the observed flux after the forward shock has transversed through the density discontinuity , and the flux in the absence of the collision at a frequency much greater than the peak of the emission is given by @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a factor by which the lorentz factor of the outer shell decreases as a result of the collision . the dependence of the observed flux on @xmath181 can be more rapid than the linear function considered above , depending on the temporal profile of the deceleration of the ejecta ( see e.g.  5.2 ) .",
    "the decrease in the observed emission from the forward shock due to the density jump at a frequency much greater than the peak of the emission is therefore given by @xmath182 , neglecting the enhanced energy losses from the shocks that may arise during the collision .",
    "this is clearly not the case at frequencies either below @xmath183 or for which there is significant emission from the reverse shock ( typically a factor of @xmath125 lower in frequency ) . at these frequencies ,",
    "the observed flux is expected to increase .",
    "we now generalize the above results to a spatially varying external density .",
    "the afterglow modeling used here is similar to that described in salmonson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the jet deceleration is calculated from the mass and energy conservation equations .",
    "the lateral spreading of the jet is neglected .",
    "the calculation of radiative losses includes synchrotron emission , and the synchrotron spectrum is taken to be a piecewise power law with the usual self - absorption , cooling , and injection break frequencies , calculated from the cooled electron distribution and magnetic field .",
    "the observed flux is obtained by integrating the jet emission over the equal arrival time surface .",
    "strong temporal variations compared to the canonical power - law decay can be produced by changes in the circumburst density or by energy variations ( e.g. meszaros et al .",
    "for example , as shown in ramirez - ruiz , merloni & rees ( 2001 ) , a shock wave that has been slowed by the surrounding medium could be caught up by subsequent shocks , increasing the shock wave energy .",
    "alternatively , the shock wave s energy may have varied as the result of encountering an external medium of variable density .",
    "while here we concentrate on the case where the dominant variations are in density , the two alternatives can be distinguished by exploiting the fact that the flux at @xmath184 is insensitive to variations in the ambient density , whereas below the cooling frequency @xmath185 ( nakar et al . 2003 ; heyl & perna 2003 ) .",
    "as the blast wave expands into the ambient matter , its kinetic energy is used to shock and heat the matter .",
    "deceleration due to this starts in earnest when about half the initial energy is transferred to the shocked matter .",
    "the characteristic mass @xmath186 where this takes place is given by equation ( [ eqn : mdec ] ) .",
    "this phase ends when so much mass shares the energy that the lorentz factor drops to 1 .",
    "this occurs at a mass scale @xmath187 ( see equation [ eqn : mnr ] ) .    in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] , for example , the stellar wind is not dense enough to slow down the ejecta to non - relativistic speeds before reaching @xmath188 , so that we expect part of the blast wave evolution as we see it to take place outside the @xmath28 density distribution . in a rarefied wind such as that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] , the shock front will expand within the stellar wind until it reaches the density discontinuity at about 0.2 pc without significant deceleration . over the typical time of observation of a grb afterglow , the impact of the relativistic ejecta with the density enhancement will produce a clear feature in the observed emission .",
    "[ fig : flux ] and its caption summarize the predicted r - band afterglow lightcurve from hours until about a few years after the burst .",
    "one can see sharp break in the flux decay curve that coincides with a precipitous drop in lorentz factor when the afterglow shock meets the shell . in this model , the isotropic energy of the ejecta is @xmath189 erg . the characteristic synchrotron frequency is lower than that in the absence of the collision .",
    "this effect is responsible for the decrease in flux ( at a fixed frequency ) seen at about @xmath190 days .",
    "further observable transitions are produced as the blast - wave plows deeper into the shocked - wind discontinuity .",
    "jet effects are expected to become important at a time @xmath191 just before the impact takes place .",
    "this makes the jet - break time not easily identifiable .    the evolution of the apparent source size is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_perp ] .",
    "the afterglow image is limited to a circle on the sky , whose size grows as @xmath192 ( granot & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the assumption of a spherical flow may also serve as an adequate description of a jetted flow , at sufficiently early times before the jet break time , @xmath193 , when the lorentz factor of the flow drops below the inverse of the jet opening angle ( rhoads 1997 ) . in the case of a jet , the image at @xmath194 is expected to be different than in the spherical case ( oren , nakar & piran 2004 ; granot , ramirez - ruiz & loeb 2004 ) and will no longer be circular for observers who are situated away from the jet axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_perp ] ) .",
    "the image size depends decisively on the density profile of the ambient medium into which the grb fireball propagates .",
    "the effects of the density discontinuity on the size of the afterglow image can be seen by comparing the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_perp ] .",
    "this is not altogether surprising : the ejected material is decelerated by the external medium at a smaller radius than it would be in the absence of the density discontinuity .",
    "the calculations above demonstrate how the measurable properties of such afterglows depend on the nature of the progenitor star and the medium around it .",
    "the smoothness or clumpiness of the swept - up shell may be responsible for small - scale variability observed in many gamma - ray burst afterglows . as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , the required degree of clumping in the wolf - rayet star wind itself does not seem plausible . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , there is the possibility of clump development from the swept up rsg wind .",
    "as stated above , the shocked rsg wind is accelerated by the ( less dense ) shocked wr wind and is therefore subject to rt instabilities .",
    "the shell is initially thin and is therefore also subject to vishniac instabilities .",
    "the two instabilities must then be coupled .",
    "the coupling mechanism appears to be a displacement of gas towards the interior of the bubble at the contact surface by the rt instability , which induces the formation of a valley in the outer shock , driving what is fundamentally a vishniac instability .",
    "garca - segura et al . ( 1996b ) found that clump formation is not efficient for the case of pure rt instabilities in thick shells and concluded that a necessary condition for clump formation to occur is that a shell be thin enough to allow vishniac - like instabilities to drive transverse motions to form the clumps .",
    "many rt fingers will then warp and break , forming knots .",
    "once formed , the knots tend to dissipate .",
    "several process tend to destroy the inhomogeneities embedded in a wind - blown bubble , namely thermal evaporation ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) , ablation ( hartquist et al . 1986 ) and photo - evaporation ( mckee 1986 ) .",
    "if not inhibited by the presence of a magnetic field , heat conduction may deplete the clumps .",
    "the thermal evaporation time is @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the temperature of the hot shocked wr wind , @xmath197 and @xmath198 are , respectively , the radii and densities of the clumps , and @xmath67 is the shocked wind density . for @xmath199 , @xmath200",
    "k and @xmath201 pc one has @xmath202 yr , so that , if conduction is unimpeded , the lifetime of the clumps may be shorter than the nebula lifetime .",
    "erosion via ablation is far less effective , and the clumps survive if , as expected ( see e.g. hartquist et al .",
    "1986 ) , heat conduction is inefficient . the ablation time for a knot is @xmath203 we estimate @xmath204 .",
    "the characteristic photo evaporation time of a clump at a distance @xmath20 from a star emitting @xmath205 ionizing photons per second is @xmath206 for the clump parameters considered above and @xmath207 s@xmath3 one has @xmath208 yr .",
    "small neutral condensations are thus likely to be photo - evaporated while larger ones survive .",
    "the jet will then encounter clumps  if they are not efficiently destroyed  with large variations in density .",
    "presumably the clump is symmetric such that @xmath209 whether or not the ambient object collapses onto the shell is a key distinction that must be made in order to understand how the clump determines the time structure .",
    "we assume here the case of a `` collapsible '' object ( such as a wind clump ) .",
    "the contribution to the peak duration from the time the jet takes to move through the clump @xmath210 , is negligible compared with the time the shell takes to engage the perpendicular size of the object .",
    "this engagement time is caused by the curvature of the jet .",
    "the curvature of the expanding jet prevents it from engaging the cloud instantaneously .",
    "rather , the portion of the jet at @xmath211 requires a time @xmath212 longer to reach the cloud . at an angle @xmath116 from the line of sight ,",
    "the time to engage the object is @xmath213 . at a typical angle of @xmath214 ,",
    "@xmath215 the alternative is that the ambient source does not collapse , but produces photons on a scale of @xmath216 ( unlikely ) .",
    "the timescale in this case is determined from the light travel time across the overlap of the shell thickness and the ambient source thickness .",
    "if the clumps where distributed as a power - law of clump sizes , one might expect a power law distribution of observable peak widths .",
    "the cumulative effect of many small - scale density perturbations will tend to average out during the expansion history of the jet , and , therefore , the resultant afterglow profile should be relatively smooth .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath216 is set by observed afterglow variability timescales ( i.e. @xmath217 ) , where @xmath218 short time scale of afterglow oscillations provide interesting upper limits of @xmath219 au on the size of the clumps around grb 011211 ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2004 ) and grb 030329 ( lipkin et al .",
    "these limits are lower than the fluctuation amplitudes seen on similar scales in the local interstellar medium ( wang & loeb 1999 ) , though they may reflect the length scale of comet - like clumps produced in ring nebulae surrounding massive stars .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that the environment of a massive star at the time of its death is a very rich one . even in the simplest case of a wind",
    "whose properties do not vary over the life of the star , complex behaviour with multiple possible transitions in the observable part of the afterglow lifetime may be seen .",
    "the eventual resulting afterglow lightcurve depends fairly strongly on the properties of the system , especially the mass - loss rate of the star and the ambient density .",
    "this has a good and a bad side . on the negative side",
    ", it implies that one can not be too specific about the times at which we expect to see transitions in the observed emission . on the positive side , if and when we do see these transitions , they can be fairly constraining on the properties of the stellar progenitor .",
    "considering the radial range relevant to grbs , the absence of the expected @xmath69 density structure in many bursts is not surprising . on the other hand ,",
    "the reason for low densities remains unclear .",
    "a wind termination shock may resolve this matter although very special conditions are necessary to bring this about . because the density in a shocked wind is higher than that in a free wind at the same radial distance , the low - density requirement is not alleviated by appealing to a shocked wr wind . a low stellar mass wind loss ,",
    "a faster wind velocity or a low metallicity may help , although it is not clear whether realistic assumptions can provide the required low densities ( wijers 2001 ; chevalier et al .",
    "2004 ) . the following point should be emphasized here . the fireball model used to infer the circumburst density is highly simplified . for example",
    ", the wind density is assumed to follow a pure @xmath28 law and to be free of inhomogeneities , the expanding jet surface is assumed uniform with no internal ( density , velocity ) gradients and the fraction of the explosion energy in the post shock magnetic field is assumed to be constant ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) .",
    "we do not know whether a description of the afterglow data is possible with a wide variety of underlying assumptions and whether that would substantially change the parameters inferred .",
    "still , the low densities inferred by afterglow observations are thus problematic for the collapsar model .",
    "the task of finding useful progenitor diagnostics is simplified if the pre - burst evolution leads to a significantly enhanced gas density in the immediate neighborhood of the burst .",
    "the detection of spectral signatures associated with the grb environment would provide important clues about the triggering mechanism and the progenitor .",
    "a special case is that of grb 021004 , where lines of highly ionized species , blueshifted relative to the host galaxy , have been attributed to a wolf - rayet stellar wind ( mirabal et al .",
    "2003 ; schaefer et al .",
    "stars interact with the surrounding interstellar medium , both through their ionizing radiation and through mass , momentum and energy transfer in their winds .",
    "mass loss leads to recycling of matter into the interstellar medium , often with chemical enrichment .",
    "mass loss is a significant effect in the evolution of massive stars ; in particular , for stars that enter wr stages ( e.g. ramirez - ruiz et al . 2001 ) . wr stars follow all or part of the sequence wnl , wne , wc and wo , which corresponds to a progression in the exposure of nuclear products ( cno equilibrium with h present , cno equilibrium without h , early visibility of the products of the 3@xmath158 reaction and then a growing ( c+o)/he ratio respectively ) .",
    "mass loss drastically influences stellar yields . at low @xmath220",
    "there is a high production of @xmath158-nuclei , while at higher @xmath220 most of the he and c produced is ejected in stellar winds and escapes further nuclear processing.this characteristic offers a direct observational test of which stars are likely to produce a grb .    finally , the total energy observed in @xmath17-rays from grbs whose redshift has been determined is diverse ( e.g. soderberg et al .",
    "one appealing aspect of a massive star progenitor is that the great variety of stellar parameters can probably explain this diversity . given the need for a large helium core mass in progenitors , the burst formation may be favored not only by rapid rotation but also by low metallicity .",
    "larger mass helium cores might have more energetic jets , but it is unclear whether they can be expected to be accelerated to large lorentz factors ( macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ; ramirez - ruiz , celotti & rees 2002 ) .",
    "many massive stars may produce supernovae by forming neutron stars in spherically symmetric explosions , but some may fail neutrino energy deposition , forming a black hole in the center of the star and possibly a grb .",
    "one expects various outcomes ranging from grbs with large energies and durations , to asymmetric , energetic supernovae with weak grbs ( totani 2003 ; granot & ramirez - ruiz 2004 ) .",
    "the medium surrounding a grb would provide a natural test to distinguish between different stellar explosions .",
