    "all celebrated bps configurations in field theories , such as instantons  @xcite , monopoles  @xcite and vortices  @xcite , have been generalized to the noncommutative case , originally in  @xcite , in  @xcite and in  @xcite , respectively ( see  @xcite for reviews and further references ) .",
    "solution generating techniques such as the adhm construction  @xcite , splitting  @xcite and dressing  @xcite methods have also been generalized to the noncommutative setting in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",

    "noncommutative instantons in higher dimensions and their interpretations as d - branes in string theory have been considered in  @xcite@xcite . in all of these constructions",
    "the usual worldvolume description of d - branes emerges from the equivalence between analytic and topological formulations of k - homology .    in this paper",
    "we will complete the construction initiated in  @xcite of multi - instanton solutions of the yang - mills equations on the manifold which is the product of noncommutative euclidean space @xmath3 with an ordinary two - sphere @xmath4 .",

    "chains _ of branes and antibranes with higgs - like open string excitations between neighbouring sets of d - branes .",
    "the equivalence between instantons and vortices may then be attributed to the decay of an unstable configuration of d@xmath5-branes into a state of d0-branes ( there are no higher brane charges induced because @xmath6 is equivariantly contractible ) .",

    "2 we introduce basic definitions and set some of our notation , and present the field equations that are to be solved . in section",
    "3 we write down an explicit ansatz for the gauge field which is used in the @xmath1-equivariant dimensional reduction . in section  4",
    "we describe three different interpretations of the ansatz as configurations of d - branes , as charges in equivariant k - theory , and as field configurations in a quiver gauge theory ( later on these three descriptions are shown to be equivalent ) . in section  5 the dimensional reduction mechanism is explained in detail in the new language of graded connections and the resulting nonabelian vortex equations , arising from reduction of the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations , are written down . in section  6",
    "we introduce the noncommutative deformations of all these structures . in section  7",
    "we find explicit bps and non - bps solutions of the noncommutative yang - mills equations and show how they naturally realize representations of the pertinent quiver . in section  8 we develop an @xmath1-equivariant generalization of the ( noncommutative ) atiyah - bott - shapiro construction , which provides an explicit and convenient representation of our solution in terms of k - homology classes . in section  9",
    "we compute the topological charge of our instanton solutions directly in the noncommutative gauge theory , and show that it coincides with the corresponding k - theory charge , which then allows us to assign d0-brane charges to the solutions from a worldvolume perspective .",
    "finally , in section  10 we construct some novel bps solutions in the vacuum sectors of the noncommutative field theory and describe their relation to stable states of brane - antibrane systems .",
