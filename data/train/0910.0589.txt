    "galaxies with rings have been studied in order to understand the internal dynamics and evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "this type of object was the topic of an extensive review by buta & combes ( 1996 ) where they explained that , in most cases , such structures as rings are associated with bars or other non - axisymmetric disk disturbances .",
    "the rings are very often sites of active star formation and , in the majority of cases , result from some resonance phenomena .",
    "buta & combes mention a small fraction of the galaxies with rings formed by galaxy collisions , mergers , or accretion of intergalactic matter .",
    "these are called `` collisional ring galaxies '' ( crgs ) and were reviewed by appleton & struck - marcell ( 1996 ) ; the cartwheel galaxy is a good example of this type of objects .",
    "the crgs are formed , according to the authors , by the `` bulls - eye '' collision of one galaxy with another that is gas - rich .",
    "the collision drives a symmetric density wave into the gas disk , which triggers star formation in a circular region centered on the impact site .",
    "this ring galaxy formation scenario was first explored by lynds & toomre ( 1976 ) and a catalog of such objects was produced by madore et al .",
    "the madore et al .",
    "compilation lists for each entry at least two objects very close together and having approximately the same redshift that they identify as likely the collider projectile and the colidee target ring .",
    "another type of galaxy with rings is the `` accretion ring '' ( buta & combes 1996 ) of which hoag s object is deemed to be the prototype .",
    "the literature describes arguments about its nature , whether this is a ring formed in a barred galaxy whose bar subsequently dissolved ( brosch 1985 ) or whether the core is not the remnant of a bar but an elliptical galaxy ( schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) and the ring is the result of accretion .",
    "schweizer et al . described seven other galaxies as similar objects and defined a class of `` hoag - type '' objects that might be quite rare .",
    "wakamatsu ( 1990 ) observed one of those seven galaxies and showed that its central object is oval , concluding that it might indeed be the remnant of a bar .    yet",
    "another type of ringed galaxy is the  polar ring galaxy \" ( prg ) .",
    "formation mechanisms for such objects were investigated in detail by bournaud & combes ( 2003 ) .",
    "the prgs are galaxies that show outer rings composed of stars , dust and gas , with orbits approximately perpendicular to the plane of the gas - poor host galaxy .",
    "n - body simulations by bournaud & combes showed that a scenario by which the ring is formed from material accreted by a lenticular or elliptical galaxy from another galaxy is a more likely explanation for the observed prgs than that of a major galaxy merger ( see also knappen et al .",
    "2004 and silchenko & moiseev 2006 ) .",
    "alternative formation scenarios were proposed , such as accretion of cold gas from intergalactic space ( macci 2006 ) , or mergers of two disk galaxies with specific orbital configurations ( bekki 1998 ) .",
    "observationally , iodice ( 2003 ) investigated the tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation for prgs using hi line widths and k or b - band luminosities , and showed that these objects are located far from the t - f relation for spiral galaxies .",
    "they concluded that the larger hi rotation velocities observed for the polar rings , in comparison with the smaller ones expected from the k - band luminosity , could be explained if the prgs would have dark matter haloes flattened along the equatorial planes of the rings .",
    "combes ( 2006 ) proposed that , since the polar rings orbit at a different angular orientation than the host galaxy in the same halo , prgs could be used as probes of the three - dimensional shape of dark matter ( dm ) haloes .",
    "this , provided the prg is in equilibrium in the gravitational potential and that its mass is not so high as to disturb the halo gravitational potential .",
    "the study of prgs may , therefore , be beneficial also to the investigation of the nature of the dm in galactic haloes .",
    "this was demonstrated by the salt observations of the prg am1934 - 563 ( brosch et al . 2007 ) where the dm halo appears to have collapsed onto the luminous part of the galaxy , not onto the ring .    the widest sample of prgs is offered by the compilation of whitmore ( 1990 , hereafter referred to as the polar ring catalogue = prc ) with more than 100 objects .",
    "a sub - sample of galaxies from the prc was studied by brocca ( 1997 ) .",
    "they searched for galaxies that were either up to five ring diameters away or were of similar size to the ring and could have encountered it within the last gyr or so .",
    "since they did not find more companions of these types in comparison with a normal galaxy sample , they concluded that it is possible the rings are a very long - lived phenomenon , formed in the distant past , and not a recent accretion or interaction event .",
    "ring galaxies are probably relegated to regions of relatively low galaxy density and are transitory phenomena .",
    "long - lived rings in clusters of galaxies would contradict the galaxy harassment of gas - containing objects expected to take place in cluster environments ( moore 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the dimming of the star - forming ring due to the transformation with time of its gas and dust into stars would also cause the ring to become undetectable .",
    "precession of oblique rings in the gravitational potential of the galaxy , and the dissipation due to the diffuse material in the ring , should have caused long - lived rings to become exactly perpendicular to the equatorial planes of their host galaxies or to cease to exist as separate entities .",
    "the question of identifying high - redshift ring galaxies was addressed for the first time by reshetnikov ( 1997 ) , who found two candidates among the hubble deep field objects .",
    "these two objects , 2 - 809 at z@xmath10.64 and 2 - 906 at z@xmath11.2 , which reshetnikov found similar to the prototype prg ngc 2685=the helix galaxy , have only scant observational information originating from the four - band hdf observations . a similar study of the hubble ultra - deep field ( reshetnikov & dettmar 2007 ) revealed hudf 1619 , a candidate prg at z@xmath11.3 .    a comprehensive survey by lavery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , from a visual inspection of 162 deep hst archival images , yielded 25 objects with redshifts from 0.35@xmath2z@xmath21.0 that could possibly be ring galaxies .",
    "note that these redshifts are , in most cases , estimates based on the assumption of a standard - candle magnitude of m@xmath3=21.1 mag for these objects . a comparison of the estimated vs. measured redshifts for the six objects with spectroscopy in the lavery et al .",
    "list indicates that two objects differ very significantly from their estimated redshift while four are in reasonable agreement .",
    "note also that lavery et al . called the objects they studied `` collisional ring galaxies '' following appleton & struck - marcell ( 1996 )",
    "; since we believe that this implies a pre - conception about the nature and origin of the galaxies , we will refrain from using this term in the present paper .",
    "the object discussed here represents a first attempt to bridge between the reasonably well - studied but low redshift prc sample and those derived from hst observations by reshetnikov ( 1997 ) , lavery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and reshetnikov & dettmar ( 2007 ) . since the most distant ring galaxies are few and not well - studied , except by lavery et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2004 ) , it may be useful to study objects more distant than those in the prg but closer than those found on hst images that may bridge the distance gap to z@xmath10.35 .",
    "such objects can serve also as templates to understand the high - z prgs , once a larger sample will become available .",
    "this paper presents an interpretation of existing observational data along with new observations of the object sdss j075234.33 + 292049.8 ( referred to as rg1 ) at z=0.060149 , identified as a ring galaxy by eo during an investigation of large - separation gravitationally lensed agns ( ofek 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "this object is significantly more distant than most ring galaxies published and studied so far , with the exception of those in reshetnikov ( 1997 ) , lavery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and reshetnikov & dettmar ( 2007 ) .",
    "we show that two possible explanations could be invoked for this object : a barred spiral , with a pair of semi - circular arms forming the apparent ring , or a classical but rare prg , as the immediate morphological evidence would argue .",
