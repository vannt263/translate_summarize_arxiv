    "a quantum two level system ( tls ) interacting with a single mode of a quantized electromagnetic field is a central topic within the scope of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "typically , the light - matter interaction is weak enough to warrant the use of some version of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite to describe both static @xcite and time dependent systems @xcite .",
    "however , recent progress in the field of circuit qed has enabled the fabrication of ultra - small mode - volume cavities where the light - matter interaction strength can be a considerable fraction of a cavity photon energy . in this regime ,",
    "evidence of the breakdown of the jc - model ( with the rotating wave approximation ) has been observed in superconducting @xcite and semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "in previous work , we have gone beyond the tls approximation and solved the many - body schrdinger equation exactly for electrons embedded in a semiconductor nanostructure , subject to a single mode quantized em field and an external classical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the electron - electron and photon - electron interactions were treated exactly using exact numerical diagonalization ( for details see ref .",
    "we predicted the failure of the jc - model ( including anti - resonance terms ) at high coupling strengths for a static and closed system .",
    "here , we expand on that work by adding an explicit time dependence to the total hamiltonian and investigate its dynamical properties .    we investigate the effects of time dependent addition to the total hamiltonian which does not depend on the cavity photon creation or annihilation operators . in the language of the jc - model , this means that we are perturbing the atomic term of the total hamiltonian as opposed to the cavity field or interaction term .",
    "the time dependent term is a sinusoidal drive which is modulated by an envelope function which varies slowly compared with other characteristic time scales of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : descr ] we describe the static part of the hamiltonian which contains the geometry of the semiconductor nanostructure as well as the electron - electron and photon - electron interaction . in sec .",

    "the paramagnetic interaction term can then be written as @xmath51 where we have defined the electron - photon coupling strength @xmath52 , which is the characteristic energy scale for the photon - electron interaction .",

    "the states @xmath84 are then used as a basis in time dependent calculations which are covered in section [ sec : time ] .",

    "can be varied since @xmath58 depends only on geometry .",
    "the same excitation and de - excitation pattern is apparent , even for the ultrastrong coupling @xmath164 .",
    "we did not perform calculations for higher coupling because of issues with numerical convergence at higher coupling strengths ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed convergence calculations ) .",
    "counter - intuitively , the maximum excitation energies at @xmath165 in fig .",
    "[ fig : etime_ec ] is proportional to the inverse square of the coupling strength @xmath70 .",
    "we can therefore see that the maximum excitation energy follows the relationship @xmath166 .    by doing calculations for many different values of @xmath86 , @xmath70 and magnetic field strength",

    "deducing the @xmath169 relationship was straightforward since @xmath86 and @xmath70 are both parameters we can freely change .",
    "however , to show the @xmath170 relationship we had to vary the matrix elements @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "we did this by doing calculations for different magnetic field strengths ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : linfit ] ) . varying the magnetic field changes the geometry of the system and thereby changes both @xmath171 and @xmath172 . by doing this",
    "we eliminate the possibility of the symmetric excitation de - excitation behavior being a special case of the geometry we have chosen or due to the time reversal symmetry ( which the magnetic field breaks ) .",

    "[ fig : linfit ] we see that the agreement with eq .",
    "is very good for one and two electrons while large deviation is apparent for three electrons .",

    "note that in both ( a ) and ( b ) , the cavity photon de - tuning is held constant at @xmath186,width=327 ]    we find that the mean number of photons follows the same relationship as the energy @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the peak value of @xmath109 .",

    "is encoded in the two matrix elements @xmath171 and @xmath172 it is tempting to say that a tls description is applicable and we can ignore the inactive electronic states ( all electronic states except @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "this is true for small coupling strength where the jc - model can be used and the diamagnetic interaction term is small .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : m2_comparison ] , a tls description starts to fail at coupling strengths of @xmath189 . what is surprising in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2_comparison ] is that for coupling strength @xmath189 , including the diamagnetic interaction term in a tls model gives much less accurate results than if it is ignored .",
    "this behavior is observed when @xmath190 .",
    "it seems that the effects of the diamagnetic interaction term are canceling the effects of the inactive states",
    ". however , for even higher coupling strengths , the tls model ( with or without the diamagnetic interaction term ) will fail because it ca nt account for the complicated effect of inactive states in an energy spectrum such as the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we will end this section by investigating the robustness of the results .",
    "[ fig : detuning ] shows results with different values of the drive de - tuning .",

    "the envelope function is a gaussian shaped pulse that varies slowly compared to characteristic time scales of the system .",
    "both the drive frequency and the cavity photon frequency are on resonance with a transition in the electronic system .",
    "the only approximations which are made are the finite size of single- and many - body bases as well as the finite precision of the numerical integration . the convergence with respect to these parameters is carefully controlled .",
    "we observed a symmetric excitation and de - excitation of the system where the drive causes the system to climb up the jaynes - cummings ladder .",
    "when the pulse dies out , the system descends down the ladder back to its original ( ground ) state .",
    "this is not a simple adiabatic effect because even though the envelope function varies slowly , the drive frequency matches that of the cavity photons as well as a transition in the electronic nanostructure .    we found",
    "that when the system exhibits symmetric excitation and de - excitation , the maximum expectation values of the energy and photon number follow a simple relationship which is independent of the specific geometry , but does depend on the number of electrons in the system .",
    "the effect is very robust for one electron , slightly less so for two electrons and considerable deviation is observed for three electrons .",

    "<S> we find that the drive causes symmetric excitation and de - excitation where the system climbs up the jaynes - cummings ladder and descends back down symmetrically into its original state . </S>",
    "<S> this effect persists even in the ultra - strong coupling regime where the jaynes - cummings model is invalid . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the robustness of this symmetric behavior with respect to the drive de - tuning and pulse duration . </S>"
