    "this paper will be focused on a modeling of x - ray propagation through a metal layer .",
    "propagation of electromagnetic waves , such as x - ray , may be interpreted via two phenomena : absorption and scattering of the corresponding photons .",
    "absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter , typically the electrons of an atom .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic energy is transformed into internal energy of the absorber , for example thermal energy .",
    "scattering is the process in which moving particles or waves are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more paths due to localized non - uniformities in the medium through which they pass .",
    "scattering phenomena can be divided in two classes : elastic and non - elastic scattering . in the elastic process",
    "the photon energy is conserved while in the non - elastic it is not .",
    "rayleigh scattering is an example of elastic scattering .",
    "non - elastic scattering has very low influence in x - ray propagation , therefore it will be ignored in this work .",
    "the simple model used in this theory to represent light - matter interaction is a crude assumption that avoids getting inside the actual complexity of the phenomena of light - matter interaction , and it has the advantage of leading to relatively simple analytical solutions for photon propagation valid for many real media .",
    "light - matter interaction is characterized by several phenomena that will be neglected in the consideration since may to affect the results of the investigations but could be taken into account by direct development of he theory .",
    "+ scattering phenomena has been studied in lidar ( light detection and ranging ) problems since the 70 s .",
    "lidar works similar to radar .",
    "laser shots short impulses of light in certain direction that is scattered by a medium ( atmosphere @xcite glass @xcite , @xcite , water @xcite , etc .",
    "then the telescope collects the light that is scattered back and a gauge inside apparatus measures the intensity of that light .",
    "one of the first mathematical description are found in the works of @xcite .",
    "the backscattering phenomena is mathematically modeled by the linearized boltzmann equation . that in fact is a version of kolmogorov equations .",
    "studies about the backscattering of a pulse emitted to the atmosphere through monte carlo simulations was done by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "double scattering was studied in the work @xcite .",
    "more recent work using monte carlo approach has been done by @xcite who studied the contribution of multiple scattering in the pulse stretching .",
    "cloudy sky , fog or rain were considered for the simulations .",
    "a problem of mono energetic particles pulse reflection from half - infinite stratified medium is considered in conditions of elastic scattering with absorption account in the article @xcite . in this article",
    "the scattering phenomena is modeled by the kolmogorov equation .",
    "kolmogorov equations have their physical origin in brownian motion .",
    "the fact that einstein and weiner brown motion models became obsolete increased attention to stochastic and probabilistic equations and resulted in langevin , smoluchowski and finally fokker - planck ( kolmogorov forward ) equations .",
    "it is named after adrian fokker and max planck , german physicists who referred to it for the first time .",
    "it is also called from andrey kolmogorov who introduced it in a 1931 in his fundamental paper \" ` analytical methods in the theory of probability \" some time after adding also the backward equation that was not known to fokker and planck .",
    "the first consistent microscopic derivation of the fokker - planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by nikolay bogoliubov and nikolay krylov .",
    "the second equation was called the backward equation from then . according to e. b. dynkin ,",
    "kolmogorov was not familiar with the papers of fokker and planck @xcite in 1931 @xcite .",
    "independently the geneticist r. a. fisher studied the same equation @xcite .",
    "more recent articles on the lidar sounding of environment like @xcite reveal interest to the related direct and inverse problems nowadays @xcite .    in this paper , a problem of mono - energetic x - ray particles pulse propagating in free space , reaching a layer of beryllium and going through free space again arriving to a cylindrical detector",
    "is considered .",
    "we simplify a bit the problem taking the speed of the electromagnetic waves will be constant through air and the beryllium layer .",
    "the theory is based on multiple scattering series solution of kolmogorov equation for one - particle distribution function @xcite see also @xcite .",
