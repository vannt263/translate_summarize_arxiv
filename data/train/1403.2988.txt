    "in recent years , the study of exciton - photon hybrid - particles , polaritons @xcite , is not only making great advances in terms of fundamental understanding but also in the quest for applications . similarly to cold atoms , polaritons have a bosonic character allowing them to condense into a macroscopic coherent phase .",

    "recently , different approaches have been investigated experimentally and theoretically to realize polariton switching systems in microcavities .",
    "these approaches involve various methods and features of polariton systems including parametric scattering@xcite [ power per gate / switch 9 - 40 mw , operation time 1 ns ( theoretical ) ] , hysteresis control@xcite ( @xmath84 mw , 5 ps switching + 1 ns recovery ) , resonant blueshift@xcite ( @xmath87 mw , 1 ns ) , spin domain walls@xcite [ 140 mw ( pump)+ 4.5 mw ( probe ) , @xmath88 ps ] and polariton condensate bullets@xcite ( 44 mw , 150 ps switching + 250 ps recovery ) .",
    "compared with these studies , our procedure lies within the lower range of gate pump powers of a few mw .    regarding the speed of the device , the switching into the _ off _ state is faster than the reversing from _ off _ to _ on _ state .",
    "the speed of this reversal is certainly the main drawback of this device .",
    "it is determined by the long - lived exciton reservoir created at the gate in the _ off _ state .",
    "solutions would imply to find a way to make the excitons decay faster , or not making use of long - lived excitons at all .",
    "an _ on - off _ transition time of a few picoseconds , but the reversal _ off - on _ transition time still being in the hundreds of picoseconds , has been reported for resonant injection of polaritons in the lower polariton branch , avoiding the generation of excitons @xcite .",
    "ultrafast shifts of the lower and upper polariton branches exploiting the stark effect in microcavities @xcite have been proposed to implement optical switches with high repetition rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can envision more complex geometries where , instead of excitons , polaritons flowing in a crosswise direction are employed to create the gate barrier .",
    "this work is a conceptual study of a polariton switch and this particular design may not provide an easy way for cascadability ( capability to connect several devices in series ) so far .",
    "however , there are other schemes , where the connectivity of propagating polariton signals has been recently demonstrated by a complex set of resonantly tuned lasers @xcite .",
    "so far , for the sake of simplicity , we have considered one - dimensional dynamics of polaritons , analyzing the emission along the @xmath25-axis of a 2-@xmath3 m wide , central stripe only .",
    "we have discussed the effect of the @xmath6 barrier height only , disregarding its lateral extension . in the following ,",
    "we take into account that our system is not strictly one - dimensional , i.e. we also discuss the lateral effects depending on the size of @xmath6 . for a given laser spot size at @xmath6 ,",
    "both the resulting extent and height of the excitonic barrier depend strongly on the power of the gaussian laser beam .",
    "we show that the choice of working parameters is essential for a proper operation of the device , minimizing leakage currents around the gate . in order to observe the dynamics of these currents , it is convenient to avoid the steady state flow that is obtained under cw pumping at @xmath8",
