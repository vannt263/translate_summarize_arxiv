    "field - theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) approach proved to be highly efficient when used to evaluate universal parameters characterizing the behavior of various systems near curie point .",
    "it yields high - precision numerical estimates for critical exponents , renormalized coupling constants , universal ratios , etc .",
    ", provided lengthy enough rg expansions are employed and proper resummation of these diverging series is made ( see , .",
    "e. g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "numerical estimates for critical exponents of the ising , xy , heisenberg and some other models obtained within field - theoretical rg machinery are referred today as canonical numbers@xcite and widely used in course of comparison of the theory with computer and physical experiments including advanced measurements performed in space@xcite .",
    "rg expansions being power series in renormalized quartic coupling constant @xmath6 or in @xmath7 have coefficients that grow factorially with their number @xmath8 . to struggle this divergency the borel transformation is usually employed which turns divergent series into expansions having non - zero radius of convergence .",
    "resummation methods based on borel transformation work very efficiently when original series are alternating and their coefficients demonstrate regular behavior , i. e. being monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath8 for moderate @xmath8 , they monotonically grow up under @xmath9 .",
    "fortunately , rg expansions for the @xmath10-function and `` big '' critical exponents ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and some others ) are precisely such regular series both in three and two@xcite dimensions .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why field - theoretical rg approach turned out to be so effective numerically in the phase transition problem .",
    "however , there is a critical exponent for which rg series are not so `` friendly '' .",
    "we mean the fisher exponent @xmath0 .",
    "let us look at the perturbative expansion of @xmath0 for the three - dimensional ising model and at the corresponding @xmath2-expansion that are known today in seven - loop@xcite and five - loop@xcite approximations respectively .",
    "they are as follows :    @xmath13    @xmath14    the coefficients of above series as seen to be quite irregular , both in sign and modulo .",
    "that is why the resummation of such series by canonical ( pade - borel , conform - borel , etc .",
    ") methods is much less effective than in the case of wilson fixed point location @xmath15 and big critical exponents . as a results ,",
    "one usually prefers to evaluate the exponent @xmath0 via scaling relations instead of dealing with corresponding rg series ( see , e. g. comprehensive review@xcite ) .",
    "in such a situation it is reasonable to address some alternative technique which is able to turn original rg expansions into more appropriate ones .",
    "here we do not mean avoiding of factorial growth of the coefficients since in series ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) they are small or , at least , not too large .",
    "instead , we are looking for a tool which would convert rg expansion for @xmath0 into the series regular in sign along with making higher - order coefficients to monotonically decrease with growing @xmath8 .",
    "below , it will be shown that the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion can play a role of such a tool .",
    "this approach invented by b. nickel many years ago ( see ref . 19 in the paper of le guillou and zinn - justin @xcite ) exploits the idea that wilson fixed point location in three dimensions may be found iteratively by means of introducing fictitious small parameter @xmath3 into linear term of perturbative series for @xmath10-function .",
    "pseudo-@xmath2 expansion proved to be very efficient when used to estimate critical exponents and other universal quantities characterizing critical behavior of three - dimensional systems @xcite . even in two dimensions , where rg series are shorter and more strongly divergent",
    ", it leads to good or satisfactory numerical results @xcite .",
    "as we will see , for the exponent @xmath0 the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion turns out to be highly effective as well : it generates iteration procedures rapidly converging to the asymptotic values that are in good agreement with the numbers extracted from alternative field - theoretical and lattice calculations .",
    "it is worthy to note that ability of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion approach to accelerate rg iterations and to smooth oscillations of numerical estimates as functions of @xmath8 was discovered just after beginning of its application@xcite .",
    "it was observed also that in many cases pseudo-@xmath2 expansions do not require advanced resummation procedures ; as a rule , use of pad approximants or even direct summation are sufficient to lead to proper numerical results . in our case , however , pseudo-@xmath2 expansion demonstrates an extra advantage  it turns the series with a structure rather unfavorable from the computational point of view into those quite suitable for numerical estimates .",
    "critical thermodynamics of three - dimensional systems with @xmath17-symmetric vector order parameters is described by euclidean field theory with the hamiltonian : @xmath18 , \\ ] ] where bare mass squared @xmath19 is proportional to the deviation from mean field transition temperature .",
    "perturbative expansions for the @xmath10-function and critical exponents of this model were calculated in the six - loop approximation within the massive theory@xcite .",
    "later , rg series for critical exponents were extended up to seven - loop order by murray and nickel in their unpublished work@xcite ; seven - loop terms were reported in the paper of guida and zinn - justin@xcite .",
    "we derive the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion for critical exponent @xmath0 starting from rg series mentioned . to do",
    "this one has to substitute the @xmath3-series for the wilson fixed point location @xmath15 into perturbative expansion for the fisher exponent and reexpand it in @xmath3 .",
    "pseudo-@xmath2 expansion of @xmath15 for general @xmath1 is known up to @xmath5 term ( six - loop order)@xcite . at first glance , with this expansion in hand @xmath3-series for critical exponents",
    "may be found within the same  @xmath5  approximation .",
    "it is really so for all critical exponents but the fisher one .",
    "since the first non - zero term in rg expansion of @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath20 the length of @xmath3-series for @xmath15 turns out to be sufficient to find @xmath4 term .",
    "seven - loop contribution in rg expansion of @xmath0 was calculated for concrete values of @xmath1  most interesting from the physical point of view@xcite .",
    "that is why here we present pseudo-@xmath2 expansions of @xmath0 for @xmath21 only , leaving six - loop ( @xmath5 ) series at generic @xmath1 for section iv .",
    "seven - loop @xmath3-series obtained are as follows :    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    series ( 4)-(7 ) are seen to have much more regular structure than original rg expansions .",
    "their coefficients possess the same sign and monotonically decrease with increasing @xmath8 , apart from those of seven - loop ( @xmath4 ) terms .",
    "these coefficients being small are nevertheless some bigger than their six - loop ( @xmath5 ) counterparts signalizing that @xmath3-series remain divergent . despite of this",
    ", expansions ( 4)-(7 ) turn out to be quite suitable for getting numerical estimates .",
    "numerical values of @xmath0 are extracted from the series ( 4)-(7 ) by means of pad approximants [ l / m ] and by direct summation ( ds ) .",
    "pad triangles for ising and heisenberg models are presented in tables i and ii as typical examples .",
    "note that symbol [ l / m ] denotes here pad approximants constructed for @xmath26 , i. e. with insignificant factor @xmath27 having physical value @xmath28 ignored .",
    "as seen from tables i and ii the estimates of @xmath0 given by highest - order near diagonal approximants [ 3/2 ] and [ 2/3 ] are very close to the numbers resulting from resummed 3d rg expansions@xcite ; they differ from each other by 0.001 ( 3 per cent ) or less",
    ". moreover , the convergence of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion estimates to the asymptotic values turns out to be fast what also may be seen from both tables .",
    "similar behavior of estimates is observed in the case of direct summation of the series ( 4)-(7 ) .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by table iii where pad and ds estimates of @xmath0 as functions of @xmath8 are collected along with the values the field - theoretical and lattice calculations yield .",
    "one can see that for all four values of @xmath1 both iteration schemes lead to the numbers which agree well with other high - precision estimates .",
    "as seen from table iii the deviation of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion estimates from the alternative values is much smaller than characteristic difference between these values themselves .",
    "ds estimates reach their asymptotes monotonically what is a direct consequence of the @xmath3-series structure . on the contrary",
    ", the behavior of pad estimates turns out to be oscillatory , i. e. typical for this and other , more sophicticated resummation procedures ( see , e. g. classical papers @xcite ) . corresponding oscillation , however , are weak what is known to be specific for the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion technique .    keeping in mind optimistic results just obtained , the question arises : will numerically favorable structure of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion for fisher exponent demonstrated at @xmath29 persist for larger @xmath1 ?",
    "in other words , whether numerical power of the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion is its generic property or it manifests itself only for moderate @xmath1 ? to answer this questions we are in a position to study @xmath3-series for @xmath0 at arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "perturbative rg expansion of @xmath0 for general @xmath1 are known today within six - loop approximation@xcite .",
    "this enables us to derive corresponding pseudo-@xmath2 expansion ranging up to @xmath5 term .",
    "straightforward calculation leads to the following @xmath3-series : @xmath30 analyzing this series under various @xmath1 lying between 4 and 64 we find that :    \\i ) series ( 8) have positive and monotonically decreasing coefficients up to @xmath31 ;    \\ii ) coefficients of @xmath32 and @xmath5 terms change their signs at @xmath33 and @xmath31 respectively while other coefficients remain positive and monotonically decreasing ;    \\iii ) up to @xmath34 coefficients of @xmath32 and @xmath5 terms persist to be tiny ( @xmath35 and smaller ) , so these terms do not influence appreciably upon numerical estimates the series ( 8) yields .",
    "hence , the structure favorable for getting numerical estimates is a generic property of the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion for fisher exponent .",
    "comparison of the values of @xmath0 resulting from expansions ( 4)-(8 ) with each other and with their counterparts obtained within other approaches confirms this conclusion .",
    "these values are collected in table iv , along with the numbers given by the @xmath36-expansion@xcite : @xmath37 all the data presented are seen to be in a good agreement at any @xmath1 .",
    "why the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion technique turns out to be so efficient in particular case considered ?",
    "we have an explanation of this fact .",
    "the point is that mechanism of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion is organized in such a way that it suppresses the divergency of rg expansions for critical exponents provided these expansions are alternating .",
    "the mechanism of suppression works well for alternate series because in course of transformation of rg series into pseudo-@xmath2 expansions multiple mutual subtractions ( `` destructive interference '' ) of the terms of original series take place .",
    "if , however , we apply this technique to series with positive coefficients the subtraction is changed by summation ( `` contructive interference '' ) what makes relevant terms in pseudo-@xmath2 expansion larger than that of rg series .    this can be demonstrated explicitly .",
    "let the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion for renormalized quartic coupling constant at criticality ( wilson fixed point location ) @xmath15 be : @xmath38 while rg series for some critical exponent @xmath39 have a form : @xmath40 typically , all @xmath41 are positive , i. e. the series ( 11 ) is alternating . to obtain @xmath3-series for @xmath39",
    ", we have to substitute expansion ( 10 ) into ( 11 ) .",
    "it yields : @xmath42 \\tau^4 + ... \\ ] ] if coefficients of pseudo-@xmath2 expansion ( 10 ) for @xmath15 are positive , what is really the case for several lower - order terms@xcite , coefficients of the series ( 11 ) interfere within ( 12 ) destructively .",
    "it is clearly seen from the structure of series ( 12 ) .",
    "the character of interference , however , depends crucially on signs of coefficients of initial rg expansion .",
    "indeed , if we changed signs of odd terms in ( 11 ) , i. e. made all terms in ( 11 ) positive , destructive interference would turn into constructive what again is cleary seen from ( 12 ) .",
    "what happens in the case of fisher exponent ?",
    "since lower - order terms in rg expansions for @xmath0 have the same sign ( see , e. g. ( 1 ) ) pseudo-@xmath2 expansion machine grows them up . on the contrary , for the higher - order terms this machine works as suppressive because starting from @xmath43 term series ( 1 ) becomes ( looks as ) alternating . as a result , pseudo-@xmath2 expansion technique transforms rg series with small and irregular coefficients into @xmath3-series which possesses larger lower - order coefficients and decreasing with @xmath8 higher - order ones , i. e. demonstrates behavior similar to that of converging series .",
    "fig.1 illustrates such metamorphosis for the ising ( @xmath44 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath45 ) models .",
    "in fact , pseudo-@xmath2 expansion does not generate convergent expansions .",
    "instead , it replaces one diverging series by another , less strongly divergent .",
    "the resulting expansions , however , have much more favorable structure from the numerical point of view . in our case",
    "pseudo-@xmath2 expansions actually do not require resummation , even in its simplest  pad  form : as seen from tables iii and iv the highest - order ( @xmath4 ) estimates given by direct summation and found by means of pad analysis differ from each other by 3 percents or less .",
    "this difference is much smaller than individual and overall error bars characteristic for data provided by high - precision field - theoretical and lattice calculations .",
    "thus , as was argued earlier@xcite , the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion approach may be considered as a resummation method .",
    "this method , however , is somewhat specific  it does not turn divergent series into convergent but makes them very convenient for practical use .",
    "to summarize , we have calculated pseudo-@xmath2 expansions of the fisher critical exponent up to @xmath4 terms for @xmath16 and within six - loop ( @xmath5 ) approximation for general @xmath1 .",
    "these expansions have been found to possess a structure that is rather favorable for getting numerical estimates .",
    "having processed @xmath3-series obtained by means of pad approximants and performed their direct summation we ve obtained numerical estimates of @xmath0 that are as accurate as those extracted from advanced field - theoretical and lattice calculations .",
    "the structure of @xmath3-series for @xmath0 persists to be favorable within the wide range of @xmath1 signaling that it is a generic property of the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion for @xmath0 .",
    "we have found arguments shedding light on the roots of such fortune .",
    "they lie in the general properties of the pseudo-@xmath2 expansion machinery interfering with some peculiarities of the rg expansion for @xmath0 .",
