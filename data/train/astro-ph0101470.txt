    "accretion processes in astrophysical disks lead to enormous luminosity and huge changes in disk structure during astronomically short times .",
    "efficient transport mechanisms are necessary to achieve such short time - scales .",
    "anisotropic turbulence appears to be a major physical condition to provide astrophysical disks with strong transport .",
    "as these disks generally exhibit increasing specific angular momentum towards larger radii and thus fulfill the stability criterion of rayleigh , they do not give rise to an instability leading to turbulence by themselves .",
    "searches for instabilities in disks with rotation profiles similar to a keplerian one unveiled several ways to turbulence being more or less favorable with respect to their prerequisites for the disk configuration .",
    "gravitational instability needs the disk to be either cool or massive .",
    "nonlinear and nonaxisymmetric perturbations require a severe additional perturber near the disk ; conditions for instability in a purely hydrodynamical disk were derived by dubrulle ( 1993 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic instability essentially comes down to violating the rayleigh criterion saying that a rotation profile with an increasing specific angular momentum with radius is hydrodynamically stable , that is for @xmath5 . since the typical length of perturbations caused be external forces",
    "is supposed to be very large , the required amplitude of the perturbations has to be considerable , too , in order to violate the rayleigh criterion locally .",
    "if the length scale of the perturbation is comparable to the radius , a strong alteration of the keplerian velocity of several per cent is needed .",
    "convection was shown to deliver either negligible transport ( stone & balbus 1996 ) or inward angular momentum transport ( kley et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "the requirements for the magnetic shear - flow instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) do match astrophysical conditions in accretion disks in many configurations . all it needs is a radially decreasing angular velocity and a weak magnetic field threading the rotating object . it can even be shown that the temperature range applicable to the magnetic shear - flow concept is very broad ; even very small ionization fractions are sufficient to magnetize a disk in many cases ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "first numerical approaches to the magnetic shear - flow instability tackled the local problem ; the linear analysis as described by balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) were immediately followed by 2d simulations ( hawley & balbus 1991 ) of a small box - shaped domain which was cut out of the disk .",
    "these computations confirmed the relation between magnetic - field strength and wavenumber derived from the linear analysis earlier , they showed that the maximum growth rate of any wavenumber is independent from the field strength and that the system is capable of transporting angular momentum . because of being restricted to axisymmetric problems",
    ", they could not provide self - sustained turbulence which needs dynamo - action , and the slow decay of the turbulence is an indirect effect of the cowling theorem . improved computations dealt with a three - dimensional even though local configuration , and particular care was taken for the radial boundary conditions which are not simply periodic , but account for the shear due to differential rotation ( hawley et al .",
    "these comprehensive computations indeed resulted in magnetically sustained turbulence whose anisotropy causes efficient outward angular momentum transport .",
    "this work was followed up by stratified models ( stone et al .",
    "1996 ) covering more than 50  orbital periods of the box cut - out . as the computational domain covered 2 density scale heights",
    ", this work was a first step towards global simulations , followed up by similar approaches such as ziegler & rdiger ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "linear studies of global configurations of disks threaded by magnetic fields in various directions were carried out .",
    "curry & pudritz ( 1995 ) investigated the stability for vertical and azimuthal fields threading the disk .",
    "they found in detail that the actual initial field geometry does not strongly depend on field topology as was suggested by the numerical simulations of hawley & balbus ( 1991 ) .",
    "rdiger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) particularly addressed the angular momentum transport in their linear study .",
    "these investigations are now followed by nonlinear simulations of a compressible fluid with density stratification in global computational domains .",
    "the most recent global approach was presented by hawley ( 2000 ) following the evolution of a thick torus under the influence of an external magnetic field threading parts of the computational domain .",
    "the magnetic shear - flow instability was found to set in quickly causing enough turbulent viscosity to soon form a keplerian velocity profile .",
    "all the above mentioned numerical studies integrate the ideal mhd equations omitting magnetic diffusivity .",
    "local simulations including diffusivity were performed by fleming et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which proved the onset of instability even for low conductivity .",
    "the full understanding of accretion disks implies self - excited dynamo action as well as angular momentum transport .",
    "can positive angular momentum transport be coupled with a suitable kinetic helicity providing the expected dynamo action according to the @xmath2-effect principle ? as the kinetic helicity in stratified , rotating disks is expected to be negative , a wrong sign ( positive ) would follow for the dynamo-@xmath2-effect according to the conventional @xmath2-theories .",
    "we present global three - dimensional diffusive simulations and study the angular momentum transport as well as dynamo action and the sign of @xmath6 as a consequence of the correlation with the flow .",
    "the present computations are not meant as particular simulations of a star formation process .",
    "they focus on the applicability of the magnetic shear - flow instability for an astronomically fast process like the formation of a star .",
    "such global simulations are still a challenge for modern computers and fast algorithms .",
    "the computations presented here make use of the zeus-3d code developed for astrophysical problems of magnetohydrodynamics ( see the key papers stone & norman 1992a , b ; stone et al .",

    "a non - zero term of the average magnetic - field growth is due to the shear and requires the presence of an average radial component , in the local nomenclature @xmath47 .",
    "we follow their derivation of the averages by replacing the volume curl integral by a vector - produc surface integral of ( 3 ) .",
    "the average @xmath48 is equivalent to @xmath49 and delivers average components as @xmath50 these considerations show that slight initial fluctuations in @xmath51 are able to create non - zero average magnetic fields at any time , even if their @xmath52 vanishes , as a consequence of shear and radial accretion through @xmath53 . in particular , the non - constant vertical profile of the orbital velocity produces a @xmath54 from the initial perturbation @xmath55 .",
    "fluctuations in the accretion flow generate @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "the actual radial differential rotation then quickly produces @xmath54 from even very small @xmath56 , and toroidal fields are prone to dominate the disk fields .",
    "kinematic dynamos have been extensively examined in numerous previous publications concerning various types of geometries . a widely used mean - field approach",
    "to circumnavigate the difficulties with resolving the small scales in a model applies the likely amplification of a magnetic field through a fluctuative electromotive force parallel to the actual large - scale magnetic field .",
    "this effect is generally expressed by the term ` @xmath2-effect ' and can be thoroughly studied in e.g.  krause & rdler ( 1981 ) . in a model",
    "splitting large and small scales , the induction equation extends beyond the large - scale electromotive force such as @xmath57 the @xmath2-effect is part of the development of the small - scale electromotive force as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are tensors in general .",
    "if written in components , the induction equation shows that the essential component of the @xmath6 tensor is the @xmath61 component which converts azimuthal fields into radial and vertical fields , whereas the differential rotation converts radial and vertical fields back into the toroidal component by the large - scale part of @xmath62 .",
    "this approximation is usually referred to as an @xmath63-dynamo .",

    "special attention is payed to the symmetry of the magnetic fields of the solutions . in general",
    ", the preference of a certain symmetry is a tool to check the consistency with mean - field dynamo models .",
    "additionally , dipolar ( antisymmetric ) fields are supposed to support the launch of winds forming jets from the disk better than quadrupolar ( symmetric ) fields , with the latter rather providing closed field lines within the disk .",
    "the mean - field disk dynamo of rekowski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) produced dipolar magnetic fields for negative @xmath6 in the northern hemisphere .",
    "a number of mean - field dynamo models in one to three dimensions delivered varying symmetry of the solutions with a major influence of the boundary conditions  vacuum versus perfectly conducting .",
    "three - dimensional investigations of stability by meinel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and elstner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found quadrupolar solutions for the condition of low - conductivity surroundings of the disk , whereas perfectly conducting boundaries delivered dipolar solutions . a local model with periodic boundaries",
    "will thus not be able to answer the question of the final symmetry of the solutions .",
    "an ideal global model would comprise the entire investigated object and is less depending on the surroundings ( which will be vacuum in very good approximation ) .",
    "the parity of a the toroidal magnetic field is measured by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70are the symmetric and antisymmetric energy parts resp . , and",
    "@xmath71 is the total energy of in toroidal field component .",
    "figures  [ parityphd_cs10bh ] and [ parityphd_bgauss ] show the temporal development of parity of the toroidal magnetic fields in the models  ii and v along with a repeated plot of @xmath1 .",
    "we should emphasize that the initial perturbation of the magnetic field had dipolar symmetry .",
    "since the total flux through the vertical surfaces , however , vanishes , field configurations with either symmetry may arise from the evolution of the model .",
    "the dipolar initial perturbation may not have been fully re - organized as the diffusive time - scale @xmath72 is 1600 rotation periods for the low - diffusivity model  ii and 160 revolutions for the high - diffusivity model  v. the latter covered @xmath73 .",
    "an additional experiment used a completely mixed initial magnetic - field perturbation according to a distribution which has zero parity in @xmath55 , and the toroidal component immediately emerging from the slight vertical has zero parity , too .",
    "again , the magnetic flux through the vertical surfaces is zero .",
    "such initial conditions have been applied to models  ii and v. the runs lasted roughly 10  revolution resulting in parity variations with a slight tendency towards quadrupolar ( symmetric ) solution ( @xmath74 from + 0.1 to + 0.2 ) .",
    "average kinetic helicities were computed based on a layer slightly below one density scale - height in both hemispheres . the average is taken in @xmath75- and @xmath76-direction .",
    "there is a considerable scatter in the time series of the helicity , but temporal averages are all negative on the northern side for all models .",
    "the only exception is the northern part of model  ii with a near - zero value .",
    "negative sign also holds for the two test models with mixed - parity initial perturbation .",
    "average current helicities are also negative on the northern side ( and positive on the southern one ) throughout almost all models",
    ". the only exceptions are the mixed - parity models which show a current helicity with opposite sign compared with the kinetic helicity in both hemispheres .",
    "since the angular momentum transport is dominated by magnetic stresses , we also ask about the _ energy _ in the flow fluctuations and the magnetic field .",
    "the temporal evolutions of these two quantities in figures  [ helres_paper_cs10bh ] and [ helres_paper_bgauss ] show a clear difference between the models  ii and v. kinetic - energy dominance holds for model  ii , whereas magnetic dominance is found for model  v.    in order to evaluate the applicability of the @xmath6 approach , we compute the average toroidal field @xmath77 and compare it with the actual average electromotive force @xmath78 derived directly from the simulated vector fields .",
    "a correlation between the two quantities may justify the @xmath2-effect for dynamo generation of magnetic fields .",
    "as a meaningful @xmath6 must change its sign at the equator , we plot the correlation for both hemispheres of the disk separately ; the result is given in figure  [ dyn_temp2 ] .",
    "as the temporal fluctuations are strong , we plot the time - averages of @xmath54 and @xmath79 in figure  [ emf_bgauss ] only with their resulting sign .",
    "the quantities are also averaged in azimuthal direction and plotted in the @xmath80-plane .",
    "white areas denote a negative sign ; the dominance of negative averaged electromotive forces indicates a positive @xmath6 in the northern hemisphere in accordance with figure  [ dyn_temp2 ] .",
    "the classical understanding of the coriolis force giving preference to left - handed helicity on the northern hemisphere ( whence positive @xmath6 ) appears not applicable for the correlation plots of models  ii and iii .",
    "the fluctuations were strong , and no meaningful sign of @xmath6 can be derived .",
    "however , models ia , v , and vi show a mostly negative averaged emf for both hemispheres , while @xmath77 changes its sign .",
    "an indication for positive @xmath6 is thus found from these simulations .",
    "in fact , models  v and vi are those which show saturated kinetic energies .",
    "the other significant difference to the indefinite models  ii and iii is the 10times higher diffusivity , @xmath81 .",
    "notwithstanding , an indication for a negative @xmath6 was already found in simulations of a local box cut out of the disk by brandenburg et al .  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the same sign is found by ziegler & rdiger ( 2000b ) from long runs of local simulations , although a clear influence of resistivity on the evolution was found there .",
    "lowest magnetic reynolds numbers are @xmath82 for model  v in this paper , calculated with the velocity difference between inner and outer radial boundary , just as ziegler & rdiger did for the local box .",
    "these considerations are somewhat limited , since a straight - forward regression line in fig .",
    "[ dyn_temp2 ] will have a significant offset from the origin of the graph ; a vanishing @xmath77 does apparently not coincide with a vanishing @xmath83 .",
    "the effect of the other field components is considered small though ; while the average hemispherical @xmath77 are of the order of 100 , the @xmath84 is of order 10 and @xmath85 of order unity .",
    "a considerable contribution is suspected from the current density through the @xmath60-term in ( [ emf ] ) , and is appears to be quite natural that an offset in the correlation graphs in figure  [ dyn_temp2 ] is found . for this reason",
    ", we did not plot such regression lines in the figure .",
    "additionally , the sole consideration of the induction equation in the `` classical '' dynamo theory leads to the omission of the lorentz force , which is not only essential for the onset of the magneto - rotational instability but for the maintenance of the turbulence and the transport of angular momentum as well .",
    "it is thus obvious that the neglect of the back - reaction of magnetic fields on the flow need not lead to representative models of keplerian disks .",
    "three - dimensional global simulations have shown , that the magnetic shear - flow instability is a fast mechanism to generate a turbulent flow in a keplerian disk .",
    "we presented models with a computational domain covering the full azimuthal range , accounting for accretion of matter .",
    "the shakura - sunyaev parameter @xmath1 increases rapidly during the first revolutions after switching on the magnetic field and reaches @xmath42@xmath86 at this stage of the computations , though it appears not yet fully saturated in several of the models .",
    "maxwell stresses exceed reynolds stresses almost entirely .",
    "the latter undergo strong fluctuations and are partly negative .",
    "indications for a dynamo action in the disk are found , the corresponding dynamo-@xmath6 tending to be negative north of the equatorial plane and positive south of the equatorial plane .",
    "the generated magnetic fields may maintain the turbulence even if the external field ceases .",
    "the strong excitation of low - order azimuthal modes in the magnetic field is another promising fact for dynamo action with respect to the cowling theorem .      for various reasons , a representative example for an accretion disk dynamo",
    "is provided by model  v ( and nearly as well by the similar model  vi with higher inflow velocity ) .",
    "the time series is sufficiently long covering more than 18  revolution periods .",
    "the angular momentum transport reaches a saturated level of high efficiency during the last four orbital periods .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the numerical diffusivity .",
    "the striking dominance of one sign of the averaged emf in figure  [ emf_bgauss ] indicates a physically evolved , relevant state of the system .",
    "the results connected with the outcomes of mean - field dynamo theory include include the following facts : ( i ) a negative average toroidal magnetic field is found for the northern hemisphere , a positive on the southern one .",
    "the averaged emf is negative in both hemisphere indicating a _ positive _ @xmath6-effect on the northern side ( negative on the southern side ) .",
    "( ii ) the correlation plot of average toroidal field and emf gives the same picture .",
    "( iii ) _ negative _ kinetic and magnetic helicities on the northern hemisphere ( positive on the southern one ) are also consistent with a positive @xmath6 .",
    "( iv ) the _ dipolar structure _ of the solution contrasts with the results from mean - field dynamo models of disks which yield quadrupolar solutions for positive @xmath6 . we have to add though that the disks of our paper are _ not thin_. mean - field simulations by covas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show a transition from quadrupolar to dipolar fields when the opening angle of the disk is enlarged , rather representing a torus than a disk .",
    "the extension of the run - times of such simulations exceeding the order of diffusion times promises further results about dynamo action in accretion disks .",
    "the connection with mean - field concepts are most interesting as well as the implications for jet - launch models .    the invaluable help by d.  elstner , potsdam , in adapting the zeus-3d code for our purposes is greatly acknowledged .",

    "<S> we perform global three - dimensional simulations of accretion disks integrating the compressible , non - viscous , but diffusive mhd equations . </S>",

    "<S> we make use of the zeus-3d code integrating the mhd equations and added magnetic diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the efficiency of the angular - momentum transport . various model simulations delivered transport parameters of @xmath0 to 0.05 which are consistent with several local numerical investigations . </S>",
    "<S> two of the models reach a highly turbulent state at which @xmath1 is of the order of 0.1 . after a certain stage of saturating of the turbulence </S>",
    "<S> , reynolds stress is found to be negative ( inward transport ) in many of the models , whereas maxwell stresses dominate and deliver a positive ( outward ) total transport . </S>",
    "<S> several of the models yield strongly fluctuating reynolds stresses , while maxwell stresses are smooth and always transport outwards . </S>",
    "<S> dynamo action is found in the accretion disk simulations . </S>",
    "<S> a positive dynamo-@xmath2 is indicated in the northern hemisphere of the most prominent run , coming along with negative kinetic and current helicities ( all having the opposite sign on the southern side ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar structure of the magnetic field is maintained throughout the simulations , although indication for a decay of antisymmetry is found . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations covered relatively thick disks , and results of thin - disk dynamo models showing quadrupolar fields may not be compatible with the results presented here .    </S>",
