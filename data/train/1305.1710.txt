    "thermal convection plays a significant role in many engineering applications , as well as in natural phenomena , e.g. , mantle convection , atmospheric circulation , stellar convection etc . to simplify the complex nature of convective flow",

    "the two non - dimensional control parameters that characterize rbc flow are the rayleigh number ra , which is a measure of buoyancy force , and the prandtl number pr , which is a ratio of kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity .",

    "physics of large prandtl number convection is important for understanding convection in earth s mantle , viscous oil , etc .",

    "for the dissipation rates , they considered the contributions from the bulk and boundary layers separately .",
    "they showed that the parameter space ( ra , pr ) is divided into four regimes : i for @xmath18 dominated regime ; ii for @xmath19 dominated regime ; iii for @xmath20 dominated regime ; and iv for @xmath21 dominated regime ; here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the rms value of the velocity and temperature fields in the boundary layer , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding quantities in the bulk .",

    "the momentum equation gets simplified to  @xcite @xmath66 the equations for the temperature field and the incompressibility condition remain unchanged .",
    "note that the pressure term plays an important role in infinite prandtl number convection , and it can not be ignored .",
    "an easy inspection reveals that the @xmath67 condition would be violated in the absence of the pressure term .",
    "the momentum equation in a dimensional form is @xmath68 the above equation is linear , hence analytically tractable .",
    "it is more convenient to analyze the above equation in fourier space , which is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the wavenumber , and @xmath71 is the fourier mode of the field @xmath72 .",
    "using the incompressible condition ( @xmath73 ) , we deduce that @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the fourier modes in general do not satisfy the boundary conditions at the plates .",
    "yet , they capture the large - scale modes quite accurately since the energy of the convective flow is dominated by these modes .",
    "this feature becomes more significant for infinite prandtl number since the amplitudes of the larger fourier modes decrease steeply with the wavenumber ( @xmath76 ) , as evident from the aforementioned equations .    using the above equations",
    ", we can derive the total kinetic energy as @xmath77 the total energy is dominated by the large - scale flows .",
    "therefore , the pclet number pe is @xmath78 in terms of nondimensional parameters @xmath79    one of the generic features of thermal convection in a box is the finite amplitude of @xmath11 fourier modes for small @xmath80 , e.g. , @xmath81 .",
    "mishra and verma  @xcite showed using arguments based on energy transfers that @xmath82 the @xmath11 modes play an important role in determining the vertical profile of temperature .",
    "the temperature averaged over horizontal planes drops sharply near the plates ( in the boundary layer ) , and it is approximately a constant in the bulk",
    ". we will show later in the paper that the temperature drop near the plates gets significant contributions from the @xmath11 modes  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate later in the paper that the @xmath11 modes dominate the temperature fluctuations for large and infinite prandtl number convection .",
    "thus , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is defined as @xmath85 to quantify the contributions from other thermal modes , we define a residual temperature fluctuation @xmath86 as @xmath87 it is important to note that @xmath88 due to the absence of net mass flux across any horizontal cross - section in the box . as a result , the @xmath11 modes do not contribute to the heat flux @xmath89 , which is @xmath90 where , @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote respectively the complex conjugate of the vertical velocity field and the temperature field .",
    "thus , the heat flux gets contributions only from @xmath93 fluctuations .",
    "the viscous and thermal dissipation rates provide important information about the scaling of large - scale quantities  @xcite .",
    "shraiman and siggia  @xcite relate these dissipation rates to the nusselt number using the following exact relationships : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the temperature field defined as @xmath96 . in the viscous regime , we use @xmath97 and define a normalized viscous dissipation rate as @xmath98 we define a normalized thermal dissipation rate as @xmath99 note that @xmath100 in turbulent regime , but this formula is not applicable for the large and infinite prandtl number convection because of the laminar nature of the flow .",
    "the temperature equation however is fully nonlinear , hence @xmath101",
    "therefore we define another normalized thermal dissipation rate as @xmath102 we will compute these dissipation rates using numerical data and use them for validation , as well as for the prediction of nusselt number scaling .",
    "we solve the nondimensionalized rbc equations [ eqs .",

    "however , periodic boundary condition is employed on the lateral walls .",
    "fourth - order runge - kutta ( rk4 ) method is used for time advancement , and the 2/3 rule for dealiasing .    to complement the aforementioned free - slip numerical runs ,",
    "we also simulate rbc flow under no - slip boundary condition in a two - dimensional box of aspect ratio one .",
    "we used the spectral element code nek5000  @xcite for this purpose .",
    "runs were performed in a box with @xmath104 spectral elements with 7th - order polynomials within each element , resulting in a @xmath105 effective grid points in the box . for the spectrum study however we used 15th - order polynomial , which yields @xmath106 effective grid points in the box .",
    "we will describe below that the two - dimensional no - slip and three - dimensional free - slip runs exhibit similar results for the large - scale quantities and energy spectrum .",
