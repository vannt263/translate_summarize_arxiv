    "string theorists have been making predictions on enumerative invariants using dualities .",
    "one of the most famous examples is the astonishing predictions of the number of rational curves in a quintic threefold in @xcite . to understand these predictions , mathematicians first developed gromov - witten theory to give the numerical invariants a rigorous mathematical definition so that these predictions could be formulated as mathematical statements , and then tried to prove these statements .",
    "the predictions in @xcite are proven in @xcite .",
    "recently , string theorists have produced enumerative predictions about holomorphic curves with lagrangian boundary conditions by studying dualities involving open strings @xcite . moreover , assuming the existence of a virtual fundamental cycle and the validity of localization formulas , mathematicians have carried out computations which coincide with these predictions @xcite . in certain cases , these numbers can be reproduced by considering relative morphisms @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to give a rigorous mathematical definition of these enumerative invariants , so that we may formulate physicists predictions as mathematical theorems , and then try to prove these theorems .",
    "gromov - witten invariants count @xmath1-holomorphic maps from a riemann surface to a fixed symplectic manifold @xmath0 together with an @xmath2-tame almost complex structure @xmath1 .",
    "these numbers can be viewed as intersection numbers on the moduli space of such maps .",
    "we want the moduli space to be compact without boundary and oriented so that there exists a fundamental cycle which allows us to do intersection theory .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath1-holomorphic maps can be compactified by adding `` stable maps '' , whose domain is a riemann surface which might have nodal singularities .",
    "the stable compactification is compact and hausdorff in the @xmath5 topology defined by gromov @xcite .",
    "the moduli space is essentially almost complex , so it has a natural orientation . in general , the moduli space is not of the expected dimension and has bad singularities , but there exists a `` virtual fundamental cycle '' which plays the role of fundamental cycles @xcite .",
    "these are now well - established in gromov - witten theory .",
    "the `` open gromov - witten invariants '' that i want to establish shall count @xmath1-holomorphic maps from a bordered riemann surface to a symplectic manifold @xmath4 as above such that the image of the boundary lies in a lagrangian submanifold @xmath3 of @xmath4 . to compactify the moduli space of such maps , sheldon katz and i @xcite introduced stable maps in this context .",
    "the stable compactification is compact and hausdorff in the @xmath5 topology , as in the ordinary gromov - witten theory .",
    "however , orientation is a nontrivial issue in the open gromov - witten theory .",
    "moreover , the boundary is of real codimension one , so the compactified moduli space does not `` close up '' as in the ordinary gromov - witten theory , and the best we can expect is a fundamental `` chain '' .",
    "a fundamental `` chain '' is not satisfactory for intersection theory .",
    "for example , the euler characteristic of a compact oriented manifold without boundary can be defined as the number of zeros of a generic vector field , counted with signs determined by the orientation .",
    "this number is independent of the choice of the vector field , and thus well - defined . for a compact oriented manifold with boundary , one can still count the number of zeros of a generic vector field with signs determined by the orientation , but",
    "the number will depend on the choice of the vector field .",

    "the virtual fundamental chain is a zero chain with rational coefficients , and we would like to define the invariant @xmath64 to be the degree of this zero chain .",
