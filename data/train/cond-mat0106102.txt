    "the study of systems out of thermal equilibrium has attracted great attention in recent years . as their equilibrium counterparts , these systems may display continuous phase transitions characterized by a set of critical exponents @xcite .",
    "in particular , much interest exists in transitions from a fluctuating active state towards an absorbing state , i.e. a configuration where the dynamics is frozen .",
    "a prototype of a 1d lattice model with a transition into an absorbing state is the contact process @xcite , in which each lattice site can be either empty ( @xmath11 ) or occupied by a particle ( @xmath12 ) with the reactions @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "depending on the relative rates of these processes , the stationary state is empty ( when @xmath14 dominates ) , or is occupied by a finite density of particles ( if the reaction @xmath15 dominates ) .",
    "the contact process therefore displays a non - equilibrium phase transition which is known to belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . the empty lattice ( @xmath16 ) is the absorbing state .",
    "a wide range of models with transitions into absorbing states was found to belong to the dp universality class . as typical examples we quote the branching - annihilating random walks ( barw ) with an odd number of offsprings @xcite , the domany - kinzel model @xcite and the pair contact process @xcite .",
    "the dp class therefore appears to be extremely robust and quite common , but it is certainly not the only possible one .",
    "another universality class that has by now been firmly established is the so - called parity conserving ( pc ) class @xcite . a prototype model in this class is the barw with an even number of offsprings @xcite in which particles can diffuse and undergo the reactions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 an even integer . in that model ,",
    "the particle conservation modulo two is believed to be the reason for the system to show non - dp critical behavior .",
    "more recently it became clear that the parity conservation , at least at the microscopic level , is not a necessary condition for a pc transition to occur @xcite .",
    "hinrichsen @xcite provided an example of this by introducing a one dimensional model where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one particle or can be in any of @xmath0 inactive states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21  @xmath22 ) .",
    "the reactions are : @xmath23 we refer to the model defined by the reactions ( [ reac_1]-[reac_4 ] ) as to the generalized contact process ( gcp ) .",
    "the original contact process @xcite , corresponds to the case @xmath2 , in which the reaction ( [ reac_4 ] ) is obviously absent .",
    "notice that the reaction ( [ reac_4 ] ) in the case @xmath24 ensures that configurations as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 are not absorbing .",
    "such configurations do evolve in time until the different domains coarsen and one of the @xmath0 absorbing states @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ",
    "@xmath29 is reached .    for the gcp with @xmath3",
    ", it was found from simulations @xcite that the transition falls in the pc class if @xmath30 , while if the symmetry between the two absorbing states was broken ( @xmath31 ) a dp transition was recovered @xcite .",
    "one aim of this paper is to investigate the case @xmath32 , which has not been studied so far .",
    "our results are obtained by a numerical investigation based on density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques @xcite for the case @xmath4 and @xmath5 and an exact solution in the limit @xmath33 . on the basis of these results",
    "we are led to conjecture that for @xmath6 the model is always in the same universality class , which coincides with that of multispecies branching and annihilating random walks @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons which make the gcp interesting .",
    "firstly , it contains the two mayor universality classes for transitions into absorbing states , namely dp ( @xmath2 ) and pc ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "secondly , for @xmath34 is it interesting to study the effect of breaking the permutational symmetry of the model and for @xmath35 the symmetry can be broken in different ways ( see below ) . finally , it is also interesting to investigate the performance of the dmrg algorithm for a system with several absorbing configurations and with several states per site , a situation which is definitely more complicated than what was considered so far @xcite .",
    "we recall that the application of the dmrg to non - equilibrium processes is rather recent and its power / limitations have not been fully investigated yet , therefore the gcp represents another important testing ground for this purpose .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : pd ] we present the numerical results for the cases @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] we show that in the limit @xmath38 the dynamics of the model can be mapped onto that of the zero temperature @xmath0-state potts model , which allows the determination of one critical exponent .",
    "next , we present in sec . [",
    "sec : conjecture ] a conjecture for the critical behavior of the model for @xmath6 based on the numerical and exact results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : breaking ] we analyse the effect of breaking the symmetry in the @xmath4 case , while sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "as a starting point for our analysis we use the quantum form of the master equation @xcite to describe the evolution of the stochastic processes in continuous time : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a state vector whose elements are the probabilities of finding the system in a certain configuration , and the entries of the matrix @xmath41 are the transition probabilities per unit of time between different configurations . as in quantum mechanics we will call @xmath41 the hamiltonian of the system",
    ". however , in the most general case , as in the gcp , the matrix @xmath41 is non - hermitian , therefore one should distinguish between right and left eigenvectors , which are now not related by transposition . as a second consequence",
    ", the eigenvalues could be complex , but @xmath41 always has at least one eigenvalue that is zero , and the real part of the non vanishing eigenvalues is strictly positive . since we are interested in the stationary behavior of the system and the relaxation towards it , we will determine the low lying spectrum of the hamiltonian , i.e. the part of the spectrum with the smallest real part . in sections",
    "ii - iv we will consider the system to be symmetric in the ground states : @xmath42 .",
    "first of all , the conservation of probability always ensures the existence of a trivial left eigenvector with zero eigenvalue @xmath43 , where the sum is extended over all possible configurations @xmath44 .",
    "besides this left ground state , the gcp has @xmath0 trivial right ground states : the @xmath0 absorbing configurations @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . to study the rest of the low lying spectrum",
    "we apply the dmrg in combination with finite size scaling .",
    "the dmrg is an iterative algorithm through which one constructs approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath41 for long chains . at each iteration",
    "the lattice size is increased and the configurational space is truncated efficiently , so that one considers , instead of the exact operator @xmath41 , effective matrices of reduced dimensions , which can be handled numerically .",
    "the accuracy obtained for the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors is often very good .",
    "although originally invented for hermitian problems , the dmrg also works in non - hermitian cases , as it has been shown in several examples @xcite .      for @xmath47",
    "the gcp has more than one absorbing state and therefore more than two states per site .",
    "this , together with the fact that the hamiltonian is non - hermitian , makes a dmrg study of the model technically difficult .",
    "consequently it is of great importance to have a way to check the results of our method . until now",
    "the gcp has only been studied by means of monte carlo simulations , for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "therefore , this subsection is restricted to these two cases .",
    "we will explain how we applied the dmrg , give some details on the finite size scaling for @xmath3 and compare our results with @xcite .",
    "a first quantity which can be calculated by the dmrg is the gap @xmath49 between ( the real part of ) the eigenvalue of the first excited state of the hamiltonian @xmath41 and the absorbing ground states @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath49 is the inverse relaxation time and enables us to determine the critical region and the dynamical critical exponent @xmath51 .",
    "a direct implementation of the dmrg is however very unpractical since for @xmath47 we have a degenerate ground state , and the dmrg is known to work best for gapped systems .",
    "we alleviated this problem by adding at the two boundary sites the following reactions    @xmath52    ( recall that it is customary to use open boundary conditions in dmrg @xcite ) . with ( [ reac_5 ] ) , only @xmath53 is left as a ground state .",
    "the bulk critical behavior is however expected to be unchanged .",
    "next we performed the transformation @xcite : @xmath54 with @xmath55 and where @xmath41 is constructed from the reactions ( [ reac_1]-[reac_4 ] ) and ( [ reac_5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath56 is no longer a stochastic hamiltonian , the zero eigenvalue is shifted to @xmath57 , but the rest of its spectrum is exactly the same as that of @xmath41 .",
    "this can easily be checked by looking at the eigenvalues of the left eigenvectors which are the same for both matrices .",
    "therefore the calculation of the gap of the original hamiltonian with an @xmath0-times degenerate ground state is reduced to the calculation of the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath56 ( obviously provided @xmath57 is bigger than the gap of @xmath41 ) .",
    "this strategy could be generalized to other systems with several absorbing states , provided one finds an appropriate boundary reaction which  eliminates \" zero eigenstates , as done by ( [ reac_5 ] ) for the gcp .",
    "0.2truecm    before turning to the finite size analysis of the calculated gap , let us first present the phase diagram for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] shows these diagrams , obtained by the dmrg method and standard finite size scaling techniques .",
    "the region above the lines denotes the active state , where the system has a finite stationary density of particles , while below these lines the stationary density is zero and the system is in one of the absorbing states .",
    "we find ( see below ) that the critical exponents are the same all along the critical line and are those of the dp and pc universality class for @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "we notice that the active region increases from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the location of the critical lines agrees well with monte carlo simulations by hinrichsen @xcite .",
    "it is worth while at this point to present in some more detail the finite size scaling analysis employed for @xmath3 , in order to clarify the differences with the higher @xmath0 case . for each choice of the rates",
    "@xmath58 we can calculate the gap @xmath59 of the matrix @xmath41 for a system of length @xmath60 .",
    "this gap equals the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath56 defined in eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) . as a function of l",
    ", @xmath59 has a different scaling behavior in the three regions of the phase diagram . in the active phase",
    "the gap should scale as @xmath61 , since asymptotically in l the absorbing states are degenerate with a state having a finite density of particles . at the critical line we have @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the dynamical exponent . for @xmath3",
    "the system is in the pc universality class and the whole inactive phase is known to be algebraic : the gap decays as @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the latter behavior is different in dp models where the gap is finite , i.e. @xmath65 , in the inactive phase .    the finite size scaling behavior of @xmath59 can best be monitored by plotting the discrete logarithmic derivative of the gap : @xmath66 $ ] . in the active phase",
    "the scaling form @xmath61 implies @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 a positive constant ) , while @xmath69 at the critical line .",

    ", the dmrg enables us to determine the critical region and the exponent @xmath83 . as we will show in the following subsection , using different boundary conditions we can also find estimates for other exponents . in table",
    "[ table01 ] we show our estimates of the critical exponents @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in the points a and b of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "we recover the exponents of dp and pc as expected for @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , indicating that the dmrg is performing well",
    ".      since the results of the dmrg are consistent with the monte carlo results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we can confidently use it to study also the case @xmath4 .",
    "again we start by an analysis of the gap : in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we plot the quantity @xmath70 along the line @xmath85 for @xmath86 . as for @xmath3",
    "we find a clear evidence of an active phase for small @xmath72 where @xmath87 .",
    "however , when we want to determine the critical point by localising the maxima , we find that upon increasing @xmath60 the maxima shift towards larger values of @xmath72 . in the limit @xmath76",
    "we find @xmath88 , indicating that the system is always active and that the critical point is shifted to @xmath89 .",
    "this numerical evidence together with the arguments presented in the next section lead us to expect that the model is critical only if @xmath89 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the estimate of the exponent @xmath83 at @xmath90 yields @xmath91 . in the next section",
    "we will give an analytical treatment of the case @xmath89 confirming this value of @xmath83 .",
    "to get access to more critical exponents , we introduce different boundary conditions .",
    "we replace ( [ reac_5 ] ) with : @xmath92 through which particles are continuously injected at the boundary sites .",
    "now the states @xmath93 are no longer absorbing configurations , and the spectrum of the hamiltonian is non - degenerate .",
    "there is a unique right eigenvector @xmath94 , which for finite system lengths always has a finite density of particles . in the active phase",
    "the gap @xmath95 is no longer asymptotically degenerate , as in the previous case , but it remains finite , indicating that the system relaxes exponentially fast towards @xmath94 . summarizing , if we consider the model defined by the reactions ( [ reac_1]-[reac_4 ] ) and the boundary term ( [ inject ] ) we have a gap behaving as @xmath96 in the active phase , while as before @xmath97 at the critical point .",
    "this means we can use @xmath98 itself to discriminate between the active and critical domains .",
    "0.2truecm    0.2truecm    figure [ fig04 ] shows a plot of the gap @xmath98 along the line @xmath85 .",
    "when we extrapolate @xmath76 , the gap remains finite for every value of @xmath72 , i.e. we find again that the system is active throughout the whole parameter space .",
    "these data also give the possibility to estimate the correlation length exponent along the time direction : @xmath99 .",
    "finite size scaling around the critical point @xmath89 gives us the following scaling relation : @xmath100 for @xmath72 fixed and @xmath76 , @xmath98 remains finite , so the scaling function should behave like @xmath101 . as a consequence in the thermodynamic limit @xmath76",
    "the gap should vanish at the critical point as @xmath102 .",
    "the linear behavior of the gap in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] , when plotted as a function of @xmath103 , already indicates that @xmath104 and this results is also consistent with the scaling collapse reported in the inset , where we took @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    ", we found that for @xmath4 , the system is always active , except for @xmath89 where it is critical and we have exponents consistent with @xmath105 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .      to conclude our numerical calculations for the case of symmetrical ground states , we studied the system with four inactive states per site .",
    "here we restricted ourselves to a calculation of the density @xmath107 with boundary condition ( [ inject ] ) .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig06 ] .",
    "0.2truecm    from these data we find , as was the case for @xmath4 that the system is active for any finite value of @xmath72 , and that the critical exponent @xmath121 .",
    "in this section we show how the dynamics of the model can be simplified in the limit where one of the rates of the decay processes ( [ reac_1 ] ) or ( [ reac_2 ] ) goes to infinity .",
    "for @xmath38 the resulting effective dynamics coincides with that of a zero temperature @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "this leads to a determination of the exponent @xmath83 .",
    "intuitively , the argument goes as follows . for @xmath38 , all particles in the system will disappear very quickly , and in any finite system one",
    "will soon be in a configuration containing only the @xmath0 empty sites @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "particles will then be created at the boundaries separating inactive domains by ( [ reac_4 ] ) , but again they will disappear immediately by reaction ( [ reac_2 ] ) . hence , when looked at the time scale of the slow processes ( [ reac_3 ] ) and ( [ reac_4 ] ) the dynamics can be limited to the set of configurations that contain only empty sites .",
    "( in this limit the creation of two particles on nearest neighbour sites occurs with even smaller probability and the effect of ( [ reac_1 ] ) can therefore be neglected ) . as an example",
    "consider : @xmath126 the whole process consists of moving the domain wall one unit to the left with rate ( on the time scale of the slow process ) equal to @xmath127 .",
    "going in this way through all possibilities one can derive an effective dynamics on the slow time scale , which turns out to involve diffusion , annihilation and coagulation of domain walls .",
    "the above heuristic reasoning can be made mathematically rigorous using a fast rate expansion introduced in @xcite .",
    "we therefore write @xmath41 as @xmath128 where @xmath129 contains the reactions ( [ reac_1]),([reac_3 ] ) and ( [ reac_4 ] ) while @xmath130 contains only the reactions ( [ reac_2 ] ) . in the limit @xmath38 ,",
    "it is appropriate to apply the schwinger - dyson formula to the operator @xmath131 which appears in the formal solution of the master equation ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "one has @xmath132 \\label{f2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 using this expansion it can be shown @xcite that for @xmath38 the time evolution operator @xmath131 becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the projector on the ground states of @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath138 equation ( [ f4 ] ) shows that for @xmath38 the generator of the effective dynamics is @xmath139 which is nothing but @xmath129 projected onto the ground states of @xmath137 . in the gcp , the ground states of @xmath137 for a chain of length @xmath60 are the @xmath140 configurations without particles and @xmath141 is then the effective hamiltonian of the slow processes projected in this reduced space .",
    "this is the mathematical description of the physical arguments given in the beginning of this section .",
    "if one works out the matrix elements of @xmath141 ( see the appendix ) one obtains that the following processes can occur with the indicated rates @xmath142    it is now useful to interpret the @xmath0 empty states as the possible spin values of an @xmath0-state potts model . in this language , the processes ( [ 18]-[20 ] ) can be summarized as follows : the central spin assumes the value of one of its neighbour spins with equal probability .",
    "the dynamics of our model in the limit @xmath38 is therefore consistent with the requirements of detailed balance for an @xmath0-state potts model at zero temperature .",
    "it is generally expected that if such a dynamics includes a domain wall diffusion , that then it is critical with a dynamic exponent @xmath105 @xcite , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the exponent @xmath105 can be derived exactly for the case that the rate of the process ( [ 18 ] ) equals @xmath143 , and those of the processes in ( [ 20 ] ) equal 1/2 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is quite possible that also for our model , @xmath105 exactly . for @xmath3",
    "we thus recover the known dynamical exponent @xmath105 in the inactive phase of a model with a pc transition . for @xmath6",
    "our numerical data strongly suggest that for @xmath38 the gcp is critical , and hence the exponent @xmath105 must correspond to the dynamical exponent at criticality for these models .",
    "this estimate is indeed consistent with the value that was determined numerically for @xmath4 in the previous section .",
    "the result that numerically the exponent @xmath106 is the same for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , combined with the fact that @xmath105 if @xmath6 leads us to conjecture that for all @xmath6 the critical exponents are the same , i.e. @xmath120 , @xmath105 and @xmath119 .",
    "in the next section we will give further arguments that support this conjecture .",
    "it is also possible to study the effective dynamics of the gcp for @xmath122 . in this limit",
    ", the dynamics of the model when considered on the time scale of the slow processes ( [ reac_2]-[reac_4 ] ) , will be restricted to the space of configurations without particle pairs .",
    "each particle present in the system then separates two domains of empty sites .",
    "therefore particles can be labelled by two indices and in this way they can be divided into classes .",
    "we will denote by @xmath144 a particle @xmath12 that separates an @xmath145-domain on its left side from an @xmath146-domain on its right side . in the limit @xmath122 , it is useful to look at the dynamics of these particles .",
    "when @xmath2 there is only one type of particle , and from a determination of the effective hamiltonian @xmath141 ( see the appendix ) we find that this particle can diffuse , and undergo the reactions @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "since there are no processes that create particles , we arrive at the conclusion that independently of @xmath72 , the gcp with @xmath2 must always be in the inactive state when @xmath122 .",
    "this is in agreement with our numerical results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .    for @xmath47 ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "now there are processes that both destroy and create particles present in the effective dynamics ( see the appendix ) .",
    "it is therefore in principle possible to have both an active and an inactive phase , depending on the value of @xmath72 . at this moment",
    ", we can draw no firm conclusions for the form of the phase diagram when @xmath122 . on the basis of our numerical work and on the basis of our results for @xmath38",
    ", we believe that the model is probably always active along that line , at least when @xmath35 .    0.2truecm",
    "in his paper , hinrichsen @xcite gave an heuristic argument which relates the gcp for @xmath3 to the barw with two offsprings , thus explaining the pc universality found numerically .",
    "this argument works as follows : indicating with @xmath149 the domain wall between two configurations @xmath150 and @xmath151 he considered an effective dynamics for the variables @xmath149 . as seen in the previous section such representation of the original model becomes exact either in the limit @xmath122 and then @xmath149 coincides with the particle @xmath144 , or in the limit @xmath38 where @xmath149 coincides with the bond variable @xmath152 . for finite values of these parameters",

    "@xmath149 is not a sharp domain wall , but an object with a fluctuating thickness .",

    "the model of cardy and tuber has raised some interest recently since it has been found that fermionic and bosonic versions of the model are in different universality classes @xcite . in the fermionic version only one particle per lattice site is allowed , which implies that particles of different species block each other . in the fermionic version of the model it makes for instance a difference wether",
    "the two offsprings produced by the reaction ( [ cardy_3 ] ) are placed to the same side or at opposite sides of the parent particle @xcite .",
    "if , for instance , they are placed at opposite sides the offsprings can not annihilate through the reaction ( [ cardy_1 ] ) because of the presence of the parent particle that blocks them . in the bosonic model the two offspring can instead always recombine .",
    "it is important to stress here that in the multispecies barw model we constructed ( ( [ barwe])-([barwngt2 ] ) ) from a coarse - grained representation of the gcp there are no blocking effects . by the very construction of the model two domain walls approaching each other",
    "can always annihilate .",
    "therefore even if the model is clearly of fermionic nature its universality class , as found numerically , is that of the bosonic multispecies barw .",
    "as a final point we consider the effect of breaking the permutation symmetry of the inactive states of the model . for @xmath3 hinrichsen @xcite explicitely broke the @xmath170 symmetry by choosing @xmath171 in the reaction ( [ reac_2 ] ) . as a result he found the system to switch from pc to dp behavior , which was understood as pc being related to the presence of an exact @xmath170 symmetry .",
    "0.2truecm    for @xmath4 , we now perform a similar symmetry - breaking by considering the following two cases : ( a ) @xmath172 and ( b ) @xmath173 . in both cases the system has a @xmath170 symmetry due to the equivalence of the states @xmath21 and @xmath174 .",
    "the difference is that starting from a random configuration in the first case the system is more likely to reach the absorbing states @xmath175 and @xmath176 compared with @xmath177 , while in the second case the reverse is true .",
    "we calculated the particle density @xmath178 as before , using the boundary - term ( [ inject ] ) .",
    "depending on the phase in which the model is , the density will behave as @xmath179 ( in the active region ) , @xmath180 ( at criticality ) , or @xmath181 ( in the inactive phase ) . if we define @xmath182   /\\ln\\left [   ( l+1)/\\ln ( l-1)\\right ]   $ ] , we expect @xmath183 to be zero in the active phase , to be @xmath84 at critical points , and @xmath184 in the inactive phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] we plotted @xmath185 as a function of @xmath79 for cases ( a ) and ( b ) with the choice @xmath71 and injection rate @xmath186 . in both cases for small @xmath72 one finds the typical scaling behavior of the active phase with @xmath187 just as for the case @xmath188 . for large @xmath189",
    "however the situation differs from the symmetric model . for ( a )",
    ", we find @xmath190 for large @xmath72 , i.e. one has a standard inactive phase with a particle density exponentially small in @xmath60 . in case ( b ) , @xmath185 becomes equal to @xmath143 , implying that the inactive phase is itself critical with @xmath191 . in between the active and the inactive phase",
    "we have a critical point where @xmath185 is going to a distinct finite value .",
    "the critical point estimates of @xmath185 are marked by filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] . for case ( a ) the critical point is at @xmath192 , while for ( b ) it is at @xmath193",
    ". the value of @xmath84 agrees with that of dp and pc respectively , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] where the critical values of these universality classes are indicated with a dotted line .",
    "this indicates that on breaking the symmetry of the inactive states the remaining symmetry of the _ dominant _ rates @xmath194 determines the critical behavior . in case ( b ) @xmath195 the dominant rates still have a @xmath170 symmetry leading to the pc universality class , while in case ( a ) @xmath196 , dp critical behavior is recovered .",
    "in this paper , we studied a generalised contact process first introduced by hinrichsen .",
    "the major part of our results were obtained by applying the dmrg to the model . with this technique",
    "we verified that for @xmath3 , the critical line of the model is in the pc universality class , consistent with earlier results coming from simulations .",
    "a first set of new results was obtained for the case @xmath4 , for which we found that the model is always active , except when @xmath38 , which corresponds to the critical line of the model . from our numerical work we determined the critical exponents to be equal to @xmath197 and @xmath120 . using well established scaling laws @xcite , other exponents can be determined from these three . for @xmath5 , we found evidence that the phase diagram is the same , and that the critical exponent @xmath106 also equals 1 .",
    "secondly , using a fast rate expansion that becomes exact for @xmath198 , we were able to argue that in that limit @xmath105 .",
    "it can be hoped that by examining the model for @xmath199 small using perturbation techniques , it may be possible to determine also the exponents @xmath106 and @xmath99 exactly . on the basis of these numerical and exact results we conjectured that the universality class of the model is the same for all @xmath6 .",
    "the exponent values that we found for @xmath6 coincide with those of the barw model with more than one type of particles introduced by cardy and tuber @xcite .",
    "we were able to give an heuristic argument that explains why the two models could be in the same universality class .",
    "it is interesting to remark that despite many attempts the number of universality classes found for phase transitions out of an adsorbing phase , remains very limited .",
    "it could have been hoped _",
    " priori _ that for the generalised gcp studied here , new universality classes could appear for @xmath168 . in a sense",
    "our results show that this is true , but only in the least exciting way possible : the universality class does not depend on @xmath0 , and moreover the exponents take on rather trivial values .",
    "one could hope that by lowering the permutation symmetry to a @xmath200-symmetry , other universality classes could appear for @xmath201 .",
    "this could be done , e.g. by having the rates of the process ( [ reac_4 ] ) depend on @xmath202 .",
    "but since this would only make a difference for @xmath201 , it will probably be difficult to investigate such a model with the numerical techniques currently available .",
    "we also verified that if one breaks the permutation symmetry of the model with @xmath4 , one recovers a dp or pc universality , suggesting that it is the symmetry of the largest rates that determines the universality class .",
    "finally , we remark that the consistency of the dmrg results with those coming from simulation for @xmath3 , or with the exactly determined value of @xmath83 for @xmath203 , shows convincingly that the dmrg can be trusted as a powerful method in the study of ( criticality in ) non equilibrium systems .",

    "ec is grateful to infm for financial support through pais 1999 .",
    "in this appendix we will calculate explicitly @xmath204 where @xmath205 is one of the rates of the gcp .",
    "in section iii it was shown that this reduces to the calculation of @xmath206 , the hamiltion that describes the effective dynamics . since @xmath207 this is a projection of @xmath129 on the ground states of @xmath137 .",
    "let us denote the right ground states of @xmath137 as @xmath208 and the left ones as @xmath209 . @xmath210",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath211 is evident : they are the stationary states of @xmath137 , any state @xmath212 will under the dynamics of @xmath137 relax into one of these @xmath213 .",
    "the left ground states @xmath209 can be interpreted as linear functionals giving the corresponding probabilities : any state @xmath212 will under the dynamics of @xmath137 relax into the ground state @xmath211 with probability @xmath214 ( where we assumed that @xmath209 are normalized : @xmath215 as @xmath216 since clearly @xmath217   \\left| \\psi\\right\\rangle = 1 $ ] for any ( normalized ) state @xmath212 , this projection conserves probability , meaning that when @xmath129 is a stochastic operator , so is @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore we can write the transition rates of the effective dynamics between state @xmath213 and @xmath219 as @xmath220 these matrix elements determine the effective dynamics , and we will now calculate them explicitly .",
    "we first study the limit where the rate @xmath72 of the processes @xmath221 goes to infinity .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form : @xmath222 where @xmath129 is the generator of the processes ( [ reac_1 ] ) , ( [ reac_3 ] ) , ( [ reac_4 ] ) and @xmath137 is the generator of process ( [ reac_2 ] ) with the factor @xmath72 brought out . in this case",
    "the ground states @xmath211 of @xmath137 are all configurations containing no particles @xmath12 .",
    "firstly , we note that the processes ( [ reac_1 ] ) and ( [ reac_3 ] ) can only act on configurations containing particles , so they can not contribute to the rates ( [ transitionrates ] ) of the effective dynamics and we redefine @xmath129 without them .    when we now project @xmath129 which contains only 2-site interactions , onto the @xmath211 , the resulting operator will contain 3-site interactions .",
    "it is therefore convenient to first rewrite @xmath129 as a 3-site operator .",
    "since we only have reaction ( [ reac_4 ] ) left in @xmath129 , this becomes ( @xmath223 ) @xmath224{ll } $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{k}\\longrightarrow\\emptyset_{k } a\\emptyset_{k}$ & rate 2\\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{m}\\longrightarrow\\emptyset_{k } a\\emptyset_{m}$ & rate 2\\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{l}\\longrightarrow\\emptyset_{k } a\\emptyset_{l}$ & rate 1\\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}a\\longrightarrow\\emptyset_{k}aa$ & rate 1 \\end{tabular } \\label{three - site}\\ ] ] ( together with some reactions that are obtained by reflection ) .",
    "we finally notice that the last process of ( [ three - site ] ) is again not relevant for the projection on @xmath211 , and determine the effective dynamics in the following diagram @xmath225{ccc } \\begin{tabular } [ c]{c } reaction\\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{l}{with rate ... } \\end{tabular } & \\begin{tabular } [ c]{c } projection\\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{l}{with probability ... } \\end{tabular } & netto rate\\\\ &   & \\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{k}\\stackrel{\\text{rate 2 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}a\\emptyset_{k}$ & $ \\stackrel{\\text{1 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{k}$ & rate $ 2.1=2$\\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{m}\\stackrel{\\text{rate 2 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}a\\emptyset_{m}$ & $ \\stackrel{\\text{1/2 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{m}$ & rate $ 2.\\frac { 1}{2}=1$\\\\ & $ \\stackrel{\\text{1/2}}{\\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{m } \\emptyset_{m}$ & rate $ 2.\\frac{1}{2}=1$\\\\ $ \\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}\\emptyset_{l}\\stackrel{\\text{rate 1 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}a\\emptyset_{l}$ & $ \\stackrel{\\text{1/2 } } { \\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l}$ & rate $ 1.\\frac { 1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$\\\\ & $ \\stackrel{\\text{1/2}}{\\longrightarrow}\\emptyset_{k}\\emptyset_{l } \\emptyset_{l}$ & rate $ 1.\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$ \\end{tabular } % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are the processes and their corresponding rates already given in ( [ 18]-[20 ] ) .",
    "note that this calculation is exactly the same for @xmath226 .",
    "next , we consider now the limit @xmath122 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath227 where @xmath129 is the generator of the processes ( [ reac_2]-[reac_4 ] ) , and @xmath137 is the generator of process ( [ reac_1 ] ) with the factor @xmath109 brought out .",
    "the ground states of @xmath137 are now all configurations containing no particle pairs .",
    "in contrast with the previous case , all processes of @xmath129 are now relevant for the projection on the ground states of @xmath137",
    ".    we will start with the case @xmath2 , where there is only one inactive state @xmath11 , and process ( [ reac_4 ] ) can a priori not take place . for process ( [ reac_3 ] )",
    "we again use the 3-site representation , while process ( [ reac_2 ] ) is so simple that we keep the 2-site representation .",

    "two different neighbouring inactive domains remain active .",
    "for example @xmath229 remains a process of the effective dynamics .",
    "one can easily construct the complete effective dynamics , but this does not lead to much further insight in the phase diagram .",
    "one can only conclude that because of the presence of the process ( [ ad ] ) , it is in principle possible that both active and inactive phases are present .",
    "it should be noted that rigorously for the calculation of the exponent @xmath83 one should first extrapolate the value of @xmath230 to the thermodynamic limit @xmath115 to obtain an estimate of the critical value @xmath231 .",
