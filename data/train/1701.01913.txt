    "with growing emphasis on system efficiency and reliability , a great effort has been made in developing distributed energy resources  ( ders ) such as distributed generator  ( dg ) and energy storage .",
    "these resources are small and highly flexible compared with conventional generators , and are playing an increasingly important role in the future smart grid  @xcite . on the other hand , demand - side control has presented a novel and viable way to supplement conventional supply - side control  @xcite .",
    "in fact , demand response  ( dr ) represents a significant but largely untapped resource in the power grid . according to national energy technology laboratory , with only 10% customer participation",
    ", the potential nationwide value of demand dispatch could be several billion dollars per year in reduced energy costs  @xcite .",
    "the deployment of ders and dr will not only defer infrastructure investments in the power grid , but also meet additional reserve requirements from renewable generation .",
    "although the deployment of dr and ders can lead to more economic and reliable system operation , it requires proper coordination between ders and dr to harvest their potential benefits .",
    "the coordination problem can be solved in a completely centralized manner , where a single control center accesses states of potentially thousands of devices and broadcasts control signals to them .",
    "such a centralized control strategy is often subject to several disadvantages , such as high requirement and cost in communication , substantial computational burden , limited flexibility and scalability , and disrespect of privacy  @xcite . as an alternative ,",
    "a distributed control strategy has been proposed , where each control agent maintains a set of variables and updates them through information exchange with a few neighboring agents . during the past few years",
    ", many studies have been dedicated to distributed approaches for der coordination . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors developed a distributed algorithm that is resilient against potential packet drops and applied the algorithm to der coordination . in  @xcite , a strategy based on the local replicator equation was presented for economic dispatch of dgs .",
    "other algorithms that can be applied to the der coordination include the leader - follower consensus algorithm  @xcite , two - level incremental cost consensus algorithm  @xcite , distributed algorithm based on the consensus and bisection method  @xcite , and minimum - time consensus algorithm  @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "there are also studies that incorporated power losses into the distributed algorithm design  @xcite .",
    "recently , coordination between ders and dr has been reported in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "although useful insights regarding der and dr coordination have been reported in these studies , the existing results can not be directly extended and applied to practical applications .",
    "this is because the controllable loads were simply modeled as a `` generator '' with negative generation , where the load characteristics and dynamics were totally ignored .",
    "furthermore , the studies did not address the issue of designing real - time load control strategies to achieve optimal power consumption .",
    "this paper proposes a hierarchical control framework with two layers to achieve integrated coordination of ders and dr .",
    "the underlying control strategy accounts for the detailed characteristics and dynamics of controllable loads , and addresses the issue of designing real - time control strategies .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : framework ] , the major challenges of integrated coordination between ders and dr are first discussed in detail , and then the proposed hierarchical control framework is briefly introduced with main contributions highlighted .",
    "the top layer of the proposed framework is described in section  [ sec : coordination ] , where a general coordination problem between ders and dr is formulated and solved using a distributed approach .",
    "the bottom layer of the proposed framework is described in section  [ sec : device ] , where the device aggregation and real - time control are presented and illustrated using air conditioners ( acs ) . in section  [ sec : casestudy ] , various case studies along with detailed simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework . finally , concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "power system operation requires instantaneous power balance between generation and demand that is constantly varying .",
    "most balancing is achieved through energy scheduling . in this paper ,",
    "the short - term scheduling and operation problems are considered for dgs and controllable loads . at the scheduling stage ,",
    "the optimal resource allocation problem is formulated and solved between dgs and dr , where the real - time dynamics of controllable loads must be captured . at the operation stage ,",
    "real - time control is carried out so that dgs and controllable loads follow optimal power generation and consumption , respectively .",
    "although many results regarding der and dr coordination have been presented in the literature , there are still several technical gaps that are significant enough to prohibit practical application of these existing results .",
    "first , the cost functions of dgs and the utility functions of controllable loads are required to formulate and solve the optimal coordination problem .",
    "existing studies such as  @xcite and  @xcite assume that those functions are available and can be directly used in the proposed distributed approaches .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to construct the utility functions of power for controllable loads as the cost functions of power for dgs .",
    "for instance , the utility of using an ac is directly related to the comfort an individual customer perceives at different indoor air temperatures rather than the power consumption .",
    "therefore , it is required in practice to extract the utility functions and capture the underlying economics based on the preferences of individual customers .",
    "second , it is required for practical applications to consider the operation stage as well . after the coordination problem is solved at the scheduling stage ,",
    "individual resources are expected to follow optimal generation or consumption through real - time control .",
    "it is straightforward for dgs to meet this expectation because their generation level can be continuously adjusted with existing generator controllers .",
    "however , this is often not the case for controllable loads .",
    "some controllable loads such as thermostatically controllable loads have not been designed with the capability to continuously adjust their power consumption .",
    "furthermore , their power consumption can not be directly controlled and is usually indirectly affected by other control variables .",
    "for example , the thermostat of an ac receives the temperature setpoint as the control input and then automatically switches the compressor on and off to maintain the indoor air temperature around the setpoint .",
    "therefore , a real - time load controller has to be designed for individual controllable loads using the locally acceptable control input while capturing the underlying economics .    effectively coordinating and controlling ders and dr for short - term scheduling and real - time control can not be realized by simply adding one coordination algorithm to another load control approach .",
    "a systematic method is needed to capture the underlying economics and dynamics of controllable load synthetically in both scheduling and real - time control .",
    "the proposed framework herein exactly meets such a need .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we discuss the gap between short - term scheduling and real - time control from existing coordination algorithms and load control approaches , and identify challenges to bridging the gap .",
    "* we design a holistic hierarchical control framework , which is capable of directly adopting existing coordination algorithms and load modeling / control approaches . *",
    "we define the functionality and formulate mathematic problems in each layer , and specify the information to be exchanged between layers / sublayers in both short - term scheduling and real - time control .",
    "* we identify candidate coordination algorithms and load control approaches that can fit in the proposed framework , and use example algorithm and approach to illustrate the proposed framework .      to overcome the technical challenges described above , this paper proposes a hierarchical control framework as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : architecture ] to facilitate integrated coordination between ders and dr .",
    "the proposed framework consists of two layers including coordination ( top ) and device layers ( bottom ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : architecture ] , dash lines represent information flow between layers / sublayers , where the information exchange frequency is the same as short - term scheduling .",
    "solid lines represent information flow within a layer / sublayer , where the information exchange frequency is typically much higher than short - term scheduling .",
    "an overview of each layer is provided herein and more details are provided in the following sections .    *",
    "the coordination layer is only involved in short - term scheduling stage . prior to each scheduling period",
    ", each coordinator receives aggregated utility or cost functions from aggregators or device controllers , as indicated by the green dash lines with up arrows .",
    "then , the aggregation of various resources including dgs and controllable loads are optimally coordinated to achieve power balance . to overcome the disadvantages associated with centralized coordination algorithms ,",
    "a distributed coordination method can be employed , where local variables are exchanged iteratively following algorithms as explained in section iii . once the coordination problem is solved , the regulation signals are sent back to aggregators or device controllers for real - time control , as indicated by the green dash lines with down arrows .",
    "* the device layer includes two sublayers : device aggregation and device control .",
    "* * in the aggregation sublayer , ders are divided into groups as appropriate .",
    "prior to each scheduling period , each aggregator received utility or cost functions from its underlying device controllers ( as indicated by the red dash lines with up arrows ) , determines the aggregated functions , and then sends these information to the corresponding coordinator in the top layer ( as indicated by the green dash lines with up arrows ) .",
    "after coordination problem is solved , each aggregator receives the regulation signals from top layer ( as indicated by the green dash lines with down arrows ) and then broadcasts these signals to its underlying devices ( as indicated by the red dash lines with down arrows ) to collectively provide the desired power generation or consumption . * * the device control sublayer is involved in both scheduling and real - time operation stages . at the scheduling stage , the controller at each device reports to its commander ( either an aggregator or a coordinator ) the required information ( as indicated by the green / red dash lines with up arrows ) , which is then used for coordination . after coordination problem",
    "is solved , it receives the regulation signals from its commander ( as indicated by the green / red dash lines with down arrows ) . during real - time operation , it regulates devices to fulfill their functionality ( e.g. , control the indoor air temperature within the comfort zone ) while following the scheduled energy generation or consumption .",
    "in the coordination layer , the optimal coordination problem is solved for each coordination period to determine the most economic schedule of power generation and consumption for ders and dr , respectively .",
    "the objective is to maximize the social welfare , i.e. , the difference between the utility of power consumption and the cost of power generation , while meeting the desired total power output without violating operating constraints of individual resources .",

    "although it is necessary to have @xmath2 and @xmath5 to formulate the optimal coordination problem as shown in   , the distributed algorithms only require their derivatives , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to solve this coordination problem .",
    "the derivative of @xmath2 ( or @xmath5 ) is often referred to as the supply ( or demand ) curve , which characterizes the relationship between marginal cost ( or utility ) and power generation ( or consumption ) .",
    "hence , the device layer has to determine the supply and demand curves of various resources and send them to the coordination layer at the beginning of each coordination period . to maintain the scalability of the proposed framework in dealing with a large number of resources",

    "the supply curves of dgs can be easily determined based on generator operational cost , fuel efficiency , and fuel cost .",
    "it is also straightforward for them to follow the optimal generation in real time because their generation level can be continuously adjusted with well established controllers .",
    "however , for controllable load , technical challenges exist in i ) determining the demand curves of controllable loads based on individual customer preference , and ii ) designing real - time control that can translate optimal power demand into locally acceptable control input . as pointed out in section  [ sec : framework ] , one essential step is to obtain the relationship between marginal utility and local control input .",
    "the demand curve dynamically represents how individual customers value convenience or comfort and the corresponding energy usage .",
    "it is essential to capture the opportunity cost of dr . to extract the demand curve ,",
    "it is necessary to quantitatively relate the marginal utility of individual customers for power demand to the local control input based on customer preference .",
    "herein , a practical method is presented for acs to extract such a relationship .",
    "this method was originally proposed in the gridwise^^ demonstration project  @xcite , and then rigorously analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "although it has been specifically presented for acs , the underlying control philosophy can be easily extended and applied to other types of controllable loads .",
    "this method represents the relationship between marginal utility and local control input by a response curve as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] , which is determined by several parameters .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the average and variance , respectively , of the electricity prices over a period of time in the past , which can be calculated by a local controller or load aggregator .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are directly specified by users , where @xmath31 is the desired indoor air temperature setpoint , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the lower and upper bounds of the acceptable indoor air temperature setpoint .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is a positive number completely abstracted from the owner s preference of indoor air temperature setpoint over the electricity price .",
    "for example , when @xmath21 is very large , the response curve becomes an almost vertical line at @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that the homeowner is very sensitive to the indoor air temperature , and would like to maintain the indoor air temperature setpoint at @xmath31 regardless of the electricity price .",
    "when @xmath21 is close to zero , the response curve becomes an almost horizontal line at @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that the house owner is very sensitive to the electricity price , and would like to sacrifice comfort for cost saving . in the gridwise^^ demonstration project ,",
    "the abstraction of @xmath21 is done by letting individual homeowners specify their preferences of comfort over cost through a user interface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interface ] .            in the proposed framework ,",
    "prior to each coordination period , each load controller at the device layer determines its dr curve ( which is equivalent to the utility / cost function ) considering the load dynamics .",
    "these curves are sent to aggregators ( as indicated by the red dash lines with up arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : architecture ] ) , and then aggregated at aggregators and later used by coordinators to run the distributed coordination algorithms for determining the optimal power consumption and real - time price signal . the price signal is then broadcasted to each device every 5 minutes , as indicated by the red dash lines with down arrows in fig .",

    "recall that the demand curve is the mapping from marginal utility to power demand .",
    "since the response curve is the mapping from marginal utility to the indoor air temperature setpoint , it is only left to determine the relationship between indoor air temperature setpoint and power demand .",
    "the dynamics of each ac  @xmath3 can be described by the equivalent thermal parameter model .",

    "the operating mode of the ac for cooling is usually controlled by a hysteretic controller , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hysteresis band centered around the indoor air temperature setpoint @xmath35 . when the model parameters @xmath45 are known to local controllers , the relationship between indoor air temperature setpoint and power consumption can be derived , which finally leads to the demand curve as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : agg_load ] that the load from aggregator  3 exceeds 2  mw during peak hours .",
    "now suppose that the thermal capacity is at 2  mw for the branch that connects aggregator  3 to the distribution system .",
    "since the branch connects only aggregator  3 to the distribution system , the power consumption by aggregator  3 is equal to the power flow in the branch ( ignoring losses for simplicity ) .",

    "when congestion occurs , the active local constraint significantly raises the energy price for the load under aggregator  3 .",
    "it should be noted that the load and price are obtained using the same optimal coordination algorithm , rather than being manually modified to meet the local constraint .",
    "compared with the case where there is not line capacity constraints , these load and price are just some different solutions of the optimal coordination problem ( 2 ) with some updated parameters .",
    "this paper presents a hierarchical control framework to integrate dr into der coordination .",
    "the proposed framework takes the advantage of existing coordination algorithms and device controllers , and bridges the gap between short - term scheduling and real - time control of controllable loads .",
    "this is done by synthetically capturing the underlying economics from dr as well as detailed dynamics for device - level control .",
    "simulation results showed that the proposed method is capable to optimally coordinate dr with dgs and control dr in real - time to realize the desired allocation of power consumption .",
    "the future work is to expand this framework to include distributed energy storage into this coordination between dgs and controllable loads .",
    "the demand curve of each ac as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acdemand ] is characterized by the maximum and minimum energy consumptions ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , and the corresponding energy prices ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , which can be calculated as follows :    * @xmath46 and @xmath48 : for the @xmath3-th unit , the theoretical upper bound of average power consumption corresponds to the operation when the device is on for the entire period . in this case , the average power consumption is simply equal to @xmath59 , which is the instantaneous power when the device is on and is constant through the 5-minute operating period . with @xmath41 , the closed - form analytical expression of indoor air temperature @xmath38 can be obtained by solving  .",
    "the setpoint @xmath35 must be low enough to satisfy to maintain the on status for the entire period assuming the device is operated in cooling mode , @xmath60 where @xmath61 when the device is initially off , and @xmath62 when the device is initially on . * * if @xmath63 , where @xmath32 is the lowest acceptable temperature setpoint specified by the user , find the energy price @xmath48 which corresponds to @xmath64 on the curve in fig  [ fig : response ] . for any price that is less than @xmath48",
    ", ac  @xmath3 will be on for the entire operating period and the maximum average power consumption @xmath46 is @xmath59 .",
    "* * if @xmath65 , the device can only be on for part of the period , because @xmath35 ( @xmath66 ) will trigger the device to be off for at least some time during the period . in this case",
    ", the energy price @xmath48 simply corresponds to @xmath32 on the curve in fig  [ fig : response ] .",
    "the corresponding upper bound of feasible average power consumption @xmath46 can be found by solving and by letting @xmath67 . *",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath49 : the theoretical lower bound of average power consumption is zero and it corresponds to the operation when the device is off for the entire period .",
    "the setpoint @xmath35 must satisfy to maintain the off status for the entire period when the device is operated in cooling mode , @xmath68 where @xmath69 when the device is initially off , and @xmath70 when the device is initially on . * * if @xmath71 , where @xmath33 is the highest acceptable temperature setpoint specified by the user , find the energy price @xmath49 which corresponds to @xmath72 on the curve in fig  [ fig : response ] .",

    ", the energy price @xmath49 simply corresponds to @xmath33 on the curve in fig  [ fig : response ] .",
    "the corresponding lower bound of feasible average power consumption @xmath47 can be found by solving and by letting @xmath75 . * for any point between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the device will only be on for part of the period .",
    "the closed - form analytical expression does not exist , but the numerical method can be used to find the corresponding average power consumption .",
    "this process needs to be repeated for a large number of points to accurately characterize the demand curve . on the other hand , submitting the entire demand curve to aggregators requires sending all the points , which also burdens the communication network .",
    "in fact , many practical applications do not require the entire demand curve , and its approximation should good enough for engineering purpose . for example , the demand curve shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : acdemand ] can be approximated by a step curve as long as the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 is small . in this case , only three quantities including @xmath47 , @xmath46 and @xmath76 are required to characterize the approximated step curve , thereby reducing communication requirement and computational cost .",
