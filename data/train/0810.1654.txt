    "the analysis of influence of thermal fluctuations on different characteristics of jjs , such as the current - voltage characteristic or the life time of superconductive state , has been made before on the basis of langevin approach [ barone @xmath0 patern@xmath3 , 1982 ; likharev , 1986 ; ortlepp @xmath0 uhlmann , 2004 ; ortlepp @xmath0 uhlmann , 2005 ] . recently experimental and theoretical work has been done on the mean switching time or mean escape time from the metastable state in periodically driven josephson junctions [ yu @xmath0 han , 2003 ; pankratov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2004 ; peltonen_et al . _ , 2006 ; sun _ et al . _ , 2007 ] .",

    ", @xmath8 is the characteristic frequency of the jj , @xmath9 is the critical current , @xmath10 is the normal conductivity of the jj , @xmath11 is the electron charge and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the planck constant . here",
    "@xmath14 is the total current across the junction , @xmath15 is the constant bias current , @xmath16 is the driving signal , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the random component of the current . because of thermal fluctuations",
    ", the random current may be represented by white gaussian noise @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimensionless intensity of fluctuations , @xmath22 is the temperature and @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "initially , the jj is biased with a current across the junction smaller than the critical one , that is @xmath24 , so as the initial condition we take the location of the phase in a potential minimum , @xmath25 . a current signal @xmath16 , such that @xmath26 , switches therefore the junction into the resistive state . in fig .  1 we show the periodical potential profile of the jj and its extreme positions",
    "within which it varies in time .",
    "the switching occurs not immediately , but at the later time , which is called the switching time .",
    "due to the noise the switching time is a random quantity .",
    "we investigate therefore the mean switching time ( mst ) @xmath27 and its standard deviation ( sd ) @xmath28 . as a driving signal",
    "we choose a sinusoidal signal @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the oscillation frequency and @xmath31 is the signal amplitude .    according to the definition [ malakhov @xmath0 pankratov , 2002 ] the mean switching time @xmath27 and its standard deviation @xmath28 are @xmath32 where @xmath33",

    "we see that , the frequency range where the nes effect is observed is reduced , and it is shifted towards smaller values of the driving frequency @xmath30 , namely from @xmath46 to @xmath39 .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     in both figs . 2 and 3 , the mst has a minimum as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "this is the signature of the resonant activation phenomenon , investigated in a jj in refs .",

    "the enhancement of the switching time may be considered in detail by plotting the dimensionless time mst as a function of the noise intensity for different values of the signal frequencies .",
    "different behaviors of mst , depending on the values of the signal frequency , occur for physical systems with metastable states [ agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2001 ; dubkov , agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2004 ] .",
    "specifically a nonmonotonic behavior and a monotonic one may be observed .",
    "let us start our consideration from small to large frequencies for the case @xmath36 and @xmath37 , see fig .  2 . for frequencies smaller than 0.2",
    "the character of the curves is similar : the mst decreases monotonically with increasing noise intensity .",
    "this case is presented in fig .  4 by two values of frequency : @xmath47 and 0.1 .",
    "if the value of the noise intensity becomes greater or equal to the height of the barrier , which is approximately equal to @xmath48 in the middle configuration ( see fig .  1 ) , the particle does not see the fine structure of the potential .",
    "this is the reason why we restrict to @xmath49 the values of the dimensionless noise intensity in the plots ( figs .",
    "so , we can see that the mst decreases , with respect to the level of deterministic switching time ( i.e. for @xmath50 ) , by increasing the noise intensity .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is the following . for small noise intensity and very low frequencies ,",
    "the particle lies in the minimum for a long enough time due to the slow variation of the potential profile .",
    "the switching from the superconductive state to the resistive one does not occur until the potential barriers disappear almost completely . by increasing the noise intensity ,",
    "the probability of the thermal activated switching increases and as a result the mst decreases .",
    "the next interval of frequencies which we consider is from 0.2 to , approximately , 0.52 , because for such frequencies the behavior of the curves is similar . in this frequency range",
    "the nes effect appears , the mst(@xmath51 ) - curve behaviour becomes nonmonotonic in contrast with the previous case ( @xmath52 ) . in fig .  4 this behavior",
    "is shown for three frequency values , namely @xmath53 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we note that in these three curves , after the nonmonotonic behavior , the mst increases again with the noise intensity @xmath51 ( for @xmath54 ) . due to the increasing values of the signal frequency",
    "the escape process from the metastable state becomes more rapid for low noise intensities and the mst for @xmath55 is lower with respect to the previous frequency range ( @xmath52 ) . due to the periodic variation of the potential profile and for",
    "noise intensities smaller than the barrier height , the particle starting from the minimum reaches a position near the top of the barrier .",
    "then there is an optimum range of the system parameters , including the driving parameters , for which the particle turns back at the metastable state because of the noise [ agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2001 ; dubkov , agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2004 ] .",
    "an enhancement of the lifetime of the metastable state produces an enhancement of the mean switching time . by increasing the noise intensity the thermally activated escape increases too and the mst decreases . for a further increase of the noise , for intensity values greater than the barrier height ( @xmath54 ) , the potential profile `` _ _ seen _ _ '' by the particle is a linear one , which fluctuates between the extreme positions of fig .  1",
    ". the particle can reach more easily positions near the state at @xmath56 and the mst , therefore , restarts to increase again with the noise intensity .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     the nonmonotonic behavior shown in fig .  4 may be explained also by considering the competition of two factors in the above mentioned frequency range : the influence of the returning force from the lefthand side of the potential profile and the increase of the variance of the phase position with increasing temperature .",
    "this explanation is related to the static case when the switching event starts because the value of the bias current is larger than the critical one [ malakhov @xmath0 pankratov , 1996 ] . by increasing the noise intensity",
    "the phase variance increases too . when the phase variance is not so large , the main part of the phase probability distribution is located on the flat part near the point @xmath57 , where the influence of the returning force is low .",
    "thus , the influence of variance dominates , and the mean switching time increases with increasing of the noise intensity , because the particle stays more near the metastable state . further increase of the phase variance , due to the noise , produces a larger probability distribution of the particle , which reaches high slope positions of the potential profile .",
    "then the returning force begins to affect from left to right because of the asymmetry induced by the potential profile and does not permit , in this frequency range , the probability distribution to move into the direction where the potential profile goes up quickly . therefore , the probability distribution expands only into the right direction and the mst decreases because the particle escapes .",
    "finally , the noise intensity becomes so large that it is possible for particle to move upstairs along the potential .",
    "the returning force is not able to hold the increasing of the variance anymore and the switching time increases again .    by further increasing of the signal frequency ( @xmath58 , for the parameter values used to obtain the curves in fig .",
    "4 ) a trapping phenomenon occurs . a threshold frequency @xmath59 exists which does not allow the particle to move to the next valley during one period of the signal .",
    "this means that for driving frequency @xmath60 , the particle is trapped within one period of the potential profile and , as a consequence , the mst diverges ( tends to an infinite value ) without noise .",
    "the value of the threshold frequency increases with increasing the bias current and/or the maximal current across the junction [ agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2001 ; dubkov , agudov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2004 ] .",
    "the frequency dependence of the switching time , for zero noise intensity , is presented in the inset of fig .",
    "5 . to be trapped the particle , starting at @xmath61 from the position @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) of the potential profile in the middle configuration ( @xmath63 ) , should not reach the position at @xmath64 , in the lowest configuration of the potential profile ( @xmath65 ) , within a quarter of the signal period . as a consequence",
    "the switching event from the superconductive state to the resistive one does nt occur . to estimate the threshold frequency we calculate , in absence of noise , the time @xmath66 spent by the particle to go from the point @xmath62 to the point @xmath64 , in the most favorable case , when the potential profile is fixed and is in the lowest configuration , with the current @xmath65 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this time @xmath66 , which is well approximated by one quarter of the threshold period @xmath67 , can be found from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) without random current @xmath68 and for a constant value of the total current @xmath4 exceeding the critical one [ malakhov @xmath0 pankratov , 1996 ] @xmath69    from here the threshold frequency @xmath70 .",

( [ le ] ) in the absence of noise ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the most prominent nes effect is observed when the frequency of the periodic signal is near the threshold frequency ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . for @xmath74 and @xmath43",
    "the maximum mst is approximately three times greater than its value at @xmath76 .    in the next fig .",
    "6 the curves of mst are shown vs the noise intensity for five frequency values near and larger than the threshold @xmath59 , that is for @xmath77 .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     two distinct transient dynamical regimes are visible .",
    "for @xmath78 we see a nonmonotonic behavior , with a finite value of @xmath27 for @xmath79 . for frequencies larger than the threshold value @xmath59 ,",
    "all the curves are characterized by a monotonic divergent behavior in the limit of small noise intensity ( @xmath79 ) . in both dynamical regimes",
    "a minimum of mst is present for a noise intensity value of the order of the barrier height . by increasing the signal frequency",
    "the curves approach the behavior of the mst obtained with a fixed potential profile , corresponding to a constant total current @xmath63 . for high frequency values , in fact",
    ", the fluctuations of the potential profile are so rapid that the potential `` _ _ seen _ _ '' by the particle is the average potential , that is the middle configuration of fig .  1 , with @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "6 the bold curve corresponds to the case of fixed potential profile with constant total current @xmath80 , and it was calculated by using the exact analytical expression of mst , obtained in [ malakhov @xmath0 pankratov , 1996 ] .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     in the regime of frequencies above the threshold one the conditions of stochastic resonance ( sr ) observation are fulfilled ( see e.g. [ borromeo @xmath0 marchesoni , 2000 ] ) .",
    "sr is manifested when the mst does not exceed the period of signal and thus , the system response becomes periodic owing to noise ( see fig .  5 , curve @xmath81 for which minimal mst is equal to @xmath82 and fig .  6 , curve @xmath83 , minimal mst @xmath84 ) .    in fig .",
    "7 the mst and its sd for four values of the signal frequency are shown .",
    "we note that , rising from low to high frequencies near the threshold @xmath59 , monotonic and nonmonotonic behavior of the mst correspond to the same behavior of the sd , respectively .",
    "moreover , in the limit of small noise intensity , all the sd behaviors show lower values with respect to the corresponding mst values , but with different behavior depending on how much the frequency is close to the threshold @xmath59 . for frequency @xmath85 ,",
    "in fact , the sd increases slowly in such a way that it takes the same value of the mst for large noise intensity ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "but for greater frequency the noise intensity value , for which the two curves of mst and sd cross , decreases .",
    "specifically we have the following cross point values : @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "this means that when the driving frequency is close to the threshold one the system becomes more unstable and even a small variation of the noise intensity has a strong influence on the system .",
    "the curve , shown in fig . 7 by the bold line , is calculated for the case of the total current @xmath91 and demonstrates a behavior of square root of the noise intensity ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this curve was obtained from the asymptotic analytical expansion of the sd in the small noise limit @xmath93 and for a fixed potential ( @xmath94 ) [ pankratov @xmath0 spagnolo , 2004 ; gordeeva @xmath0 pankratov , 2006 ] .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     in the limit of @xmath95 the curves of the sd , obtained by our simulations , approach the asymptotic curve obtained for fixed potential . the behavior of the sd curve for @xmath96 , obtained by numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) , is very close to the theoretical asymptotic curve ( @xmath91 ) not only in the low noise limit but also at larger values of @xmath51 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this feature of the sd(@xmath51 ) - curve behavior is shown in more detail in the next logarithmic plot ( fig .  8) , which demonstrates the large rising of the sd for small noise intensities with increasing frequency .",
    "8 the curves of the sd are shown for the same frequency values and parameters used in fig .  5 for the mst behaviors .",
    "again we note that the cross point between the mst and sd curves , for frequencies close to the threshold one ( @xmath98 in this case ) , is at very low noise intensities .",
    "for example for @xmath99 , the cross point is at @xmath100 .",
    "after the threshold frequency , we recover for the sd the same divergent behavior of the mst , but with larger values .",
    "this fact confirms that the switching event in this region of parameters is due to the noise .",
    "it should be noted also that for large noise intensities ( @xmath101 ) all graphs of the mst and sd collapse to the same curve , not depending on the signal frequency ( see fig .  5 and fig .",
    "this means that the new regime of switching is unaffected by the signal and it is only due to the noise .",
    "( 220,150)(10,10 )     in fig .",
    "9 the curves of mst vs @xmath51 for different values of the bias current and signal amplitude are shown .",
    "we consider two cases : ( i ) the bias current is fixed , namely @xmath36 and @xmath102 , and ( ii ) the signal amplitude is fixed , namely @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we choose @xmath90 as a signal frequency for which the nes effect is more pronounced .",
    "we see that changes of the bias current modify the curves of mst more than changes of the signal amplitude .",
    "we analyzed the transient dynamics of a single overdamped josephson junction driven by a periodic signal .",
    "the conditions of existence of the nes effect are investigated .",
    "we find that the enhancement of the switching time is larger for frequencies of the periodic signal close to the threshold frequency . in the region of the noise intensity values",
    "in which the mean switching time begins to increase , the standard deviation increases too but with different behavior depending on the proximity of the signal frequency to the threshold @xmath59 .",
    "the interval of frequencies , in which the nes effect is observed , depends on the maximal value of the total current across the junction and on the value of the bias current .",
    "there are two ways to change the value of the total current : by changing the amplitude of the driving signal or the value of the bias current .",
    "we find that the switching time changes more significantly due to the bias current variation , than due to the signal amplitude .",
    "we note that for small but nonzero values of the mccumber - stewart parameter the mst increases by several percent but qualitative character of the curves remains the same , as in the considered overdamped case .",
