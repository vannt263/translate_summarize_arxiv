    "paraffin films and other surface coatings play an integral part in several emerging technologies that employ vapors of alkali - metal atoms , including atomic magnetometers , clocks , and quantum and nonlinear optical devices .",
    "paraffin was first shown to preserve the spin polarization of alkali atoms in 1958 by robinson , ensberg , and dehmelt @xcite and was first studied extensively by bouchiat and brossel.@xcite it has been investigated by several others in the decades since,@xcite but the details of its operation as an anti - relaxation coating remain poorly understood .",
    "paraffin coatings enable narrow zeeman resonance linewidths , and they have recently been the subject of renewed interest due to advances in the technology of alkali - metal magnetometers @xcite that have led to the development of detectors with sensitivity comparable to or better than superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .",
    "modern magnetometers have enabled significant advances in low - magnetic - field nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite magnetic resonance imaging ( mri),@xcite and medical imaging,@xcite as well as paleomagnetism,@xcite explosives detection,@xcite and ultra - sensitive tests of fundamental physics.@xcite paraffin - coated cells also feature narrow hyperfine resonance linewidths and have been explored in the context of secondary frequency standards;@xcite they have also been employed in experiments involving spin squeezing,@xcite quantum memory,@xcite and `` slow light.''@xcite while cells with diameters from a few to tens of centimeters are typically employed , miniature millimeter - sized cells with paraffin coating have also been explored.@xcite in addition , similar coatings with silicon head groups have been used in magneto - optical traps,@xcite hollow photonic fibers,@xcite and noble - gas - atom optical pumping cells.@xcite    alkali atoms in the vapor phase depolarize upon contact with the bare surface of a glass container , limiting the coherence lifetime of the spin ensemble . in order to prevent such depolarization",
    ", vapor cells typically include either a buffer gas or an anti - relaxation surface coating .",
    "the inclusion of up to several atmospheres of a chemically inert buffer gas slows diffusion of alkali atoms to the cell walls , but there are several advantages to the use of a surface coating , including lower laser power requirements , larger optical signals , reduced influence of magnetic - field gradients , and a smaller collision rate with other atoms and molecules in the cell .",
    "anti - relaxation coatings can allow an alkali atom to experience thousands of collisions with the walls of the cell without depolarizing , and paraffin in particular has been demonstrated to allow up to 10,000 bounces.@xcite as the size of the vapor cell decreases , the surface - area - to - volume ratio increases , requiring improvement in the quality of the surface coating to compensate for the resulting increase in the rate of collisions with the surface , in order to maintain the same spin - coherence lifetime . in miniature alkali vapor cells with volume 1 - 10  mm@xmath0 or less , the use of surface coatings enables more sensitive magnetometers and clocks than the use of buffer gas , assuming that a coating with appropriate spin - preservation properties can be employed.@xcite    a paraffin coating significantly reduces the probability of spin destruction during a collision with the surface because it contains no free electron spins and it features a lower adsorption energy than the bare glass , thus reducing the residence time of an adsorbed alkali atom on the surface of the paraffin relative to the glass surface .",
    "the residence time of an atom at a surface site can be expressed as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the adsorption energy , @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath4 is the temperature.@xcite @xmath5 is the time constant for a perfectly elastic collision and therefore gives the high - temperature limit where the thermal energy @xmath6 .",
    "minimal @xmath7 is desirable because an adsorbed alkali atom dephases from the ensemble of atoms in the bulk of the cell , as a result of experiencing both a different magnetic field than in the cell interior and a fluctuating magnetic field generated by the hydrogen nuclei of the paraffin material.@xcite the adsorption energy for alkali atoms on a paraffin surface is small , roughly 0.06 - 0.1  ev,@xcite and assuming @xmath5@xmath810@xmath9  s ( the period of a typical molecular vibration ) gives a residence time of approximately 0.1  ns at room temperature .",
    "the performance of paraffin [ c@xmath10h@xmath11 coatings quickly degrades at temperatures above 60 - 80@xmath12c,@xcite but operation at higher temperature is beneficial for some devices because it increases the saturated vapor pressure of the alkali atoms , and thus the atomic density . for most types of paraffin , such as tetracontane ( @xmath13=40 )",
    ", the critical temperature corresponds to the melting point,@xcite but for longer - chain polyethylene coatings,@xcite which have a much higher fusion temperature of 130@xmath12c , the mechanism for the decreased performance above 60@xmath12c is not fully understood .",
    "recent magnetometers have achieved ultra - high sensitivity better than 1  ft/@xmath14 to near - dc @xcite and radio - frequency @xcite magnetic fields by operating at very high vapor density , but the high operating temperatures of these magnetometers ( @xmath4@xmath15100@xmath12c for cesium vapor and @xmath4@xmath15150@xmath12c for potassium vapor ) prevent the use of paraffin coatings .",
    "in addition , paraffin does not survive the elevated temperatures required by the anodic bonding process used in the production of microfabricated vapor cells .",
    "surface coatings with superior temperature stability are therefore required for use with high - density or microfabricated alkali vapor cells .",
    "high - temperature coatings also allow experimentation with potassium and sodium vapor , which have lower vapor pressures compared to rubidium and cesium at a given temperature .",
    "recent efforts at developing alternatives to paraffin have mainly focused on certain silane coatings that resemble paraffin , containing a long chain of hydrocarbons but also a silicon head group that chemically binds to the glass surface.@xcite such materials do not melt and remain attached to the glass surface at relatively high temperatures , enabling them to function as anti - relaxation coatings at much higher temperatures than paraffin . in particular , a multilayer coating of octadecyltrichlorosilane [ ots , ch@xmath16(ch@xmath17)@xmath18sicl@xmath16 ] has been observed to allow from hundreds up to 2100 bounces with the cell walls @xcite and can operate in the presence of potassium and rubidium vapor up to about 170@xmath12c.@xcite however , the quality of such coatings with respect to preserving alkali polarization is highly variable , even between cells coated in the same batch , and remains significantly worse than that achievable with paraffin .",
    "in addition , it was shown recently that an alkene coating , which resembles paraffin except with an unsaturated c = c double bond , can allow up to two orders of magnitude more bounces than paraffin , but only to temperatures of 33@xmath12c,@xcite and properties such as stability of the coating remain to be studied .",
    "paraffin thus remains the most widely used anti - relaxation coating for alkali spins . in order to facilitate the design and development of new coating materials for alkali - metal cells and hollow fibers , it is therefore necessary to develop a more detailed understanding of the interactions between alkali atoms and the paraffin surface , many aspects of which are not yet fully understood .",
    "indeed , the production of high - quality paraffin cells remains more of an art than a science , with little understanding of why only certain coating procedures work or the reasons that variations in those procedures affect the anti - relaxation quality of the coating .",
    "as an example , paramagnetic impurities could couple to and depolarize the alkali spins , so some researchers observe that purification of the paraffin by distillation is necessary to produce a high - quality coating;@xcite however , others have been able to use paraffins as received.@xcite in addition , a so - called `` ripening '' phase is required , which involves annealing of the paraffin - coated cell at 50 - 60@xmath12c in the presence of the alkali metal for an extended period of time ( typically hours to days ) before the cell may be used , although the specific processes that occur during ripening remain unknown .    much of the behavior of the paraffin coating during operation remains equally mysterious .",
    "for example , the paraffin coating introduces a small shift in the hyperfine frequency of the atomic ground state , which varies between cells and must be accounted for in the use of alkali vapor cells as frequency standards.@xcite in addition , the measured vapor pressure in a paraffin - coated cell is smaller than the expected saturated vapor pressure at the temperature of the cell , implying that alkali atoms can be absorbed into , and thus can diffuse within , the bulk volume of the paraffin.@xcite it has been observed @xcite that alkali vapor density increases significantly when a paraffin - coated cell is exposed to light ( particularly uv and near - uv light ) due to the light - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) effect,@xcite which causes absorbed atoms to be ejected from the paraffin coating .",
    "recently , liad effects on alkali spin relaxation have been investigated,@xcite with a focus on non - thermal control of alkali vapor density.@xcite the exact mechanisms of liad in paraffin are not yet understood ; however , it is clear that a combination of surface processes and light - enhanced diffusion of alkali atoms within the bulk of the coating are important .",
    "liad has been used with silane coatings to load photonic fibers,@xcite and it has been used with bare pyrex surfaces to load a chip - scale bose - einstein condensate ( bec),@xcite although in the latter case the desorption efficiency might be increased by orders of magnitude with a paraffin or silane coating . any coating used for liad loading of an ultra - cold atom chip would require compatibility with ultra - high vacuum . similarly , enhanced alkali - atom density is also observed upon the application of large electric fields ( 1 - 8  kv / cm ) across paraffin - coated cells,@xcite although again the exact mechanism remains unknown .    in this work we use modern surface science methods as the basis for an investigation of the interaction of alkali - metal atoms with various paraffin materials . unlike most previous studies , which primarily measured properties of the alkali vapor such as density and relaxation time",
    ", we instead observe the properties of the coating itself .",
    "fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) were used to understand bulk properties of the coating materials , while atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , near edge x - ray absorption fine - structure ( nexafs ) , and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) were used to obtain information about the coated surface and its interaction with the alkali atoms .",
    "these and similar techniques have been employed previously to study paraffins,@xcite but not in the context of their use with alkali atoms . in addition , we compared the liad yields of several different paraffin materials .",
    "an array of techniques enables a more complete characterization of the atom - surface interactions than can otherwise be achieved .",
    "the work described here is intended to demonstrate the power of these methods to thoroughly characterize and help understand the behavior of paraffin and other coating materials , in order to guide the creation of new coatings to enhance the performance of rapidly developing technologies such as microfabricated magnetometers and clocks , nonlinear and quantum optical devices , and portable liad - loaded devices .",
    "we selected paraffin waxes that have been successfully implemented as anti - relaxation coatings in alkali vapor cells , including the @xmath13-alkanes eicosane [ ch@xmath16(ch@xmath17)@xmath20ch@xmath16 ] , dotriacontane [ ch@xmath16(ch@xmath17)@xmath21ch@xmath16 ] , and tetracontane [ ch@xmath16(ch@xmath17)@xmath22ch@xmath16 ] , as well as long - chain polyethylene [ ch@xmath16(ch@xmath17)@xmath10ch@xmath16 where @xmath13 is large and varies between molecules ] .",
    "we also considered a proprietary paraffin from dr .",
    "mikhail balabas that is used in the manufacture of magnetometer cells , which we refer to here as pwmb ; this wax is obtained by fractionation of polyethelyene wax at 220@xmath12c.@xcite finally , we considered the commercially available waxes fr-130 parowax ( from the luxco wax company ) and paraflint , which are both expected to contain a mixture of various @xmath13-alkanes . unless otherwise noted , samples were coated following the typical procedures used in the manufacture of alkali vapor cells , which involve evaporating the material at high temperature in vacuum and allowing it to condense on the inner surface of the cell .",
    "fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) analysis was performed on several types of paraffin in order to identify the general functional groups present in the waxes .",
    "ftir is used extensively for structure determination and chemical analysis because it gives bond - specific information.@xcite transitions due to specific bending and stretching modes of bonds absorb infrared light at specific frequencies allowing for identification of the bonds present .",
    "spectra were obtained on a varian 640-ir system using a room - temperature dtgs ( deuterated triglycine sulfate ) detector .",
    "the aperture of the instrument was completely open , and a nominal 4  @xmath23 spectral resolution was used .",
    "the strong optical absorption of the si - o - si structure makes glass substrates opaque to infrared analysis below 2000  @xmath23 . to widen the range of ftir characterization , native oxide terminated , 500  @xmath24 m thick , ( 111)-oriented",
    ", low - doped ( phosphorus , 74 - 86  @xmath25 cm resistivity ) silicon wafers ( silicon quest international ) were instead used as substrates for paraffin coating .",
    "the silicon phonon absorption occurs below 600  @xmath23 and therefore allows for a more thorough characterization of the various waxes .",
    "in addition , the surface of the silicon wafer , as received , contains a very thin layer of oxidized silicon , which is assumed to be similar enough to the surface of glass cells that it does not disturb the behavior of the wax .",
    "a si thickness of 500  @xmath24 m or greater is necessary to achieve spectra with 4  @xmath23 resolution without complication due to interference from ghost zero - path difference ( etaloning effect ) peaks .",
    "high - resistivity si improves signal to noise by minimizing free - carrier absorption of the ir light .",
    "uncoated si samples were first situated in the beam path with the surface plane perpendicular to the light propagation direction , and 256 background spectra of the uncoated silicon wafers were obtained in transmission mode before the waxes were rub - coated onto the warmed surface , giving a layer with thickness of hundreds of nm to several @xmath24 m . to minimize baseline drift ,",

    "the preparation temperature is given at which each material was coated on the inside surface of its cell .",
    "for the data shown , desorbing light intensity of 5  mw/@xmath41 was used with the cells of the first geometry , and intensity of 2  mw/@xmath41 was used with cells of the second geometry .",
    "in addition to paraffin materials , several alkene materials are also considered .",
    "the materials labeled `` alkene  80 '' and `` alkene  110 '' are produced by fractionation of alpha olefin fraction c20 - 24 from chevron philips chemical company , which contains a mixture of straight - chain alkenes , with primarily between 18 and 26 carbon atoms ; the number in the material label refers to the temperature of distillation .",
    "alkene  80 is the highly effective anti - relaxation coating material described in ref .  .",
    "enet4160 from gelest , inc .",
    "contains 1-triacontene and small amounts of other alkenes with between 26 and 54 carbon atoms .",
    "the liad yield is highly dependent on cell geometry and can not be directly compared between samples of different geometries , even when accounting for differing intensity of the desorbing light .",
    "samples of pwmb and deuterated polyethylene show appreciable increase in rubidium density after exposure to desorbing light for both cell geometries , as does alkene  110 for the second geometry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nexafs spectra of both pwmb and polyethylene show evidence of unsaturated c = c bonds .",
    "although alkene  80 and enet4160 do not display any measurable liad effect , these results nevertheless suggest that covalently bound alkali atoms could act in part as a reservoir for the liad effect .",
    "tetracontane also shows a large liad yield , but only for the second experiment .",
    "for both cell geometries , deuterated polyethylene gives a larger liad yield when the material is deposited at higher temperature , and it also presents very different dynamical behavior depending on the preparation temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_liad ] ; after the desorbing light turns off , the vapor density for the sample prepared at 360@xmath12c is observed to be less than the initial density due to depletion of atoms from the coating.@xcite these results are preliminary and motivate a more comprehensive study of cell - to - cell variation and the effects of preparation conditions ( including particularly temperature ) , material deuteration , unsaturated bonds , and other coating parameters .",
    "= 0  s and turned off at @xmath55=45  s.,width=302 ]",
    "these measurements provide important details about the properties of effective anti - relaxation coatings and demonstrate the utility of applying surface - science methods .",
    "for instance , paraffin does not need to be in crystalline form , as evidenced by the observations of the pwmb wax using dsc and afm .",
    "particularly interesting is the detection of c = c double bonds in the pwmb wax using nexafs , a surface technique , while transmission ftir , a bulk measurement technique , does not show any c = c bonds above the detection limit of approximately 5% ; the discrepancy may be due to lack of sensitivity in the ftir measurement , but it is also possible that the molecules with unsaturated bonds represent impurities expelled to the surface of the material and not extant in its bulk .",
    "it is unknown if the double bonds are present in the raw material or if they form during fractionation when heated to 220@xmath12c .",
    "alkanes are known to decompose at high temperatures,@xcite potentially leading to the presence of unsaturated alkenes in the deposited pwmb surface coating , although the nexafs spectrum of tetracontane shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nexafs1 ] does not display evidence of double - bond formation after heating to 220@xmath12c .",
    "decomposition could explain the observed increase in liad yield for polyethylene materials deposited at higher temperatures .",
    "the alkene coating described in ref .   also contains double bonds and allows approximately 10@xmath56 bounces with the surface , significantly more than any other known material .",
    "the presence of c = c double bonds in effective anti - relaxation coatings is unexpected because unsaturated bonds increase the polarizability of the surface , and effective coatings have long been assumed to require low polarizability to enable short alkali atom residence time , although these recent results indicate that this assumption may be mistaken .",
    "the unsaturated double - bond sites may also react with alkali atoms to form alkali - carbon bonds within the coating material , as detected in the pwmb samples using xps .",
    "in fact , it is likely that passivation of the double - bond sites near the surface of the material is a necessary part of the ripening process .",
    "we may also compare the dsc observations of the thermal properties of the materials with prior measurements of the temperature dependence of the wall shift in paraffin - coated cells of the rubidium 0 - 0 hyperfine frequency , which is used for frequency reference in atomic clocks .",
    "the hyperfine frequency in a cell coated with tetracontane exhibits hysteresis:@xcite the frequency changes little until the solid tetracontane is heated to about 80@xmath12c , at which point it decreases significantly as the wax melts , and the frequency does not increase again upon cooling until the liquid tetracontane reaches a temperature 1@xmath12c colder than this and resolidifies .",
    "this behavior agrees well with the measured temperatures of the melting and fusion peaks of tetracontane .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the hyperfine frequency in cells coated with paraflint is observed to change sign at 72@xmath12c,@xcite which correlates with the endothermic peak measured with dsc .",
    "our observations suggest several avenues for further research .",
    "specific surface characteristics such as roughness and fractional coverage can be studied in order to optimize the composition of coating materials and the deposition procedure .",
    "the absence or presence of alkali - carbon bonds has significant implications with regard to the mechanism of the ripening and liad processes , and so future work will focus on the effect of unsaturated bonds on both the anti - relaxation effectiveness and liad efficiency of materials .",
    "for example , angle - resolved xps studies can reveal depth - dependent changes in the distribution of alkali and alkali - bound species in paraffins before and after treatment with desorbing light .",
    "this work can also be extended to include additional techniques for the study of coated surfaces , such as sum frequency generation ( sfg ) spectroscopy @xcite and raman spectroscopy;@xcite the latter may be particularly useful for its ability to observe the surfaces of intact , operational vapor cells .",
    "in conclusion , using modern analytic techniques we show a systematic study of paraffin waxes which can be extended to a broader set of waxes and other anti - relaxation surface coatings to understand the fundamental properties of these coatings .",
    "combining a number of different surface science methods gives information regarding the chemical nature of the bulk coating materials as well as the thin films at the surface .",
    "this knowledge will inform the design of coatings used with atomic devices . as this research continues",
    ", it will hopefully lead to the development of more effective and robust anti - relaxation coatings for use in a variety of alkali - vapor - based technologies under a wide range of operational conditions .",
