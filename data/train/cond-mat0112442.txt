    "the @xmath3-dependence of the magnon velocity is shown in fig . 5 for several @xmath2 values in the range @xmath175 . for @xmath176 , the magnon velocity vanishes at a finite critical interaction strength @xmath29 , above which the af state is unstable towards the f - af phase . in the limit of vanishing magnon velocity",
