    "<S> based on the recently updated isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model , we studied the effects of symmetry energy on the neutron to proton n / p ratio and the @xmath0 ratio in central @xmath1 reaction at 300 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the n / p ratio and the @xmath0 ratio in central @xmath1 reaction at 300 mev / nucleon mainly probe the symmetry energy in the density region 1 - 1.5 times saturation density . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath0 ratio may be able to probe the density - dependent symmetry energy above 1.5 times saturation density by making some kinematic restrictions such as the azimuthal angle and kinetic energy cuts of emitting pions . </S>"
