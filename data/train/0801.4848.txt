    "quantum game theory , the subclass of game theory that involves quantum phenomena@xcite , lies at the crossroads of physics , quantum information processing , computer and natural sciences .",
    "thanks to entanglement , quantum players can sometimes accomplish tasks that are impossible for their classical counterparts . in this paper",
    "we present the detailed analysis of one of the pseudo - telepathy games@xcite .",
    "these games provide simple , yet nontrivial , examples of quantum games that can be used to show the effects of quantum non - local correlations . roughly speaking",
    ", a  game belongs to the pseudo - telepathy class if it admits no winning strategy for classical players , but it admits a winning strategy provided the players share the  sufficient amount of entanglement .",
    "this phenomenon is called pseudo - telepathy , because it would appear as magical to a classical player , yet it has quantum theoretical explanation .",
    "our main goal is to study the connection between errors in quantum channels and the probability of winning in magic squares game .",
    "the magic square game is selected because of its unique features : it is easy to show that there is no classical winning strategy , simple enough for a layman to follow its course and feasible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will begin by presenting the magic squares pseudo - telepathy game .",
    "the we will introduce tools we are using to analyse noise in quantum systems .",
    "then we will attempt to answer the following question : _ what happens if a quantum game is played in non - perfect conditions because of the influence of quantum noise ? _ the results showing the connection between the noise level and the probability of winning will be given in section 4 .",
    "finally we will point out some issues that yet should be addressed .",
    "the magic square is a  @xmath0 matrix filled with numbers 0 or 1 so that the sum of entries in each row is even and the sum of entries in each column is odd .",
    "although such a  matrix can not exist one can consider the following game .",
    "there are two players : alice and bob .",
    "alice is given the number of the row , bob is given the number of the column .",
    "alice has to give the entries for a  row and bob has to give entries for a  column so that the parity conditions are met .",
    "in addition , the intersection of the row and the column must agree .",
    "alice and bob can prepare a strategy but they are not allowed to communicate during the game .",
    "there exists a ( classical ) strategy that leads to winning probability of @xmath1 . if parties are allowed to share a  quantum state they can achieve probability @xmath2 .    in the quantum version of this game@xcite alice and bob",
    "are allowed to share an entangled quantum state .",
    "the winning strategy is following .",
    "alice and bob share entangled state @xmath3 depending on the input ( _ i.e. _ the specific row and column to be filled in ) alice and bob apply unitary operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath6 & a_2= \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } i & 1 & 1 & i\\cr -i & 1 & -1 & i\\cr i & 1 & -1 & -i\\cr -i & 1 & 1 & -i \\end{array } \\right ] & a_3= \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } -1 & -1 & -1 & 1\\cr 1 & 1 & -1 & 1\\cr 1 & -1 & 1 & 1\\cr 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\\\ b_1= \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } i & -i & 1 & 1\\cr -i & -i & 1 & -1\\cr 1 & 1 & -i & i\\cr -i & i & 1 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] & b_2= \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } -1 & i & 1 & i\\cr 1 & i & 1 & -i\\cr 1 & -i & 1 & i\\cr -1 & -i & 1 & -i \\end{array } \\right ] & b_3= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\cr -1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\cr 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\cr 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the corresponding inputs .",
    "the final state is used to determine two bits of each answer .",
    "the remaining bits can be found by applying parity conditions .",
    "a interesting question arises : what happens if a  quantum game is played in non - perfect ( real - world ) conditions because of the presence of quantum noise.@xcite    in the most general case quantum evolution is described by superoperator @xmath9 , which can be expressed using kraus representation@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .    in following",
    "we will consider typical quantum channels , namely    * depolarizing channel : @xmath12 , * amplitude damping : @xmath13 , \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\sqrt{\\alpha } \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] \\right\\}$ ] , * phase flip , bit flip and bit - phase flip with kraus operators + @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "real parameter @xmath17 $ ] represents here the amount of noise in the channel and @xmath18 are pauli matrices .    in our scheme ,",
    "the kraus operators are of the dimension @xmath19 .",
    "they are constructed from one - qubit operators @xmath20 by taking their tensor product over all @xmath21 combinations of @xmath22 indices @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of kraus operator for a single qubit channel .",
    "although one can assign physical meaning to the parameter @xmath25 , this meaning can be different for different channels .",
    "therefore we are using channel fidelity@xcite to compare quantum channels .",
    "we define channel fidelity as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is jamiokowski isomorphism and @xmath28 is the fidelity defined as @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we are analysing the influence of the noise on success probability and fidelity of non - perfect ( mixed ) quantum states in the case when the noise operator is applied before the game gates .",
    "the final state of this scheme is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the superoperator realizing quantum channel parametrized by real number @xmath25 .",
    "probability @xmath32 is computed as the probability of measuring @xmath33 in the state indicating success @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the states that imply success .",
    "we compute success probability @xmath32 for different inputs ( @xmath36 ) and different quantum channels .",
    "our calculations show that mean probability of  success , @xmath37 , heavily depends on the noise level @xmath25 .",
    "the game results for each combination of gates @xmath38 for depolarizing , amplitude damping , phase damping , phase , bit and bit - phase flip channels are listed in fig .",

    "damping channels , wan can observe three different types of behaviour .",
    "these functions are non - increasing for those channels .",
    "the bit , phase and bit - phase flip functions reach their minima for @xmath57 and are symmetrical .",
    "this means that high error rates influence the game weakly .",
    "one can easily see that in case of input @xmath58 the phase - flip channel does not influence the probability of success .",
    "the same is true for input @xmath59 and bit flip channel and also for input @xmath60 and bit - phase flip channel .",
    "therefore it is possible to distinguish those channels by looking at success probability of magic - squares game .    .",

    "we have shown how the probability success in magic squares pseudo - telepathy game is influenced by different quantum noisy channels .",
    "the calculations show that , by controlling noise parameter and observing probabilities of success , it is possible to distinguish some channels .",
    "thus we have shown that implementation of magic square game can provide the example of channel distinguishing procedure .    in case of all channels",
    "success probability drops , with the increase of noise , below classical limit of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the physical implementation of quantum magic squares game requires high precision and can be a very difficult task .",
    "we have also shown that if channel fidelity is higher than @xmath65 the probability of success is almost linear .",
    "therefore channel fidelity is good approximation of success probability for not very noisy channels .",
