    "massive s ( mbhs ) have been postulated in quasars and active galaxies ( lynden - bell 1969 , rees 1984 ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of mbhs has recently been found in the center of our galaxy ( ghez 1998 , genzel 1997 ) and in the weakly active galaxy ngc 4258 ( miyoshi 1995 ) .",
    "compact dark masses , probably mbhs , have been detected in the cores of many normal galaxies using stellar dynamics ( kormendy and richstone 1995 ) .",
    "the mbh mass appears to correlate with the galactic bulge luminosity , with the mbh being about one percent of the mass of the spheroidal bulge ( magorrian 1998 , richstone 1998 ) .",
    "the question whether agn follow a similar -bulge relation as normal galaxies is a very interesting one , as it may shed light on the connection between the host galaxy and the active nucleus .",
    "wandel & mushotzky ( 1986 ) have found an excellent correlation between the virial mass included within the narrow line region ( of order of tens to hundreds pc from the center ) and the  mass estimated from x - ray variability in a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "a -bulge relation similar to that of normal galaxies has been reported between mbh of bright quasars and the bulge of their host galaxies ( laor 1998 ) , but the   and bulge mass estimates have large uncertainties ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies provide an opportunity to obtain more reliable -to- bulge mass ratios ( bbrs ) : because of their lower nuclear brightness , their bulge magnitudes can be measured directly . also the   mass estimates ( wandel 1998 )",
    "are much more reliable for agn with reverberation data , which are more readily obtained for low luminosity agn .",
    "the relation between the bulge and the nonstellar central source has been studied for many seyfert galaxies ( whittle 1992 ; nelson & whittle 1996 ) .",
    "these works find a tight correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the o[iii ] line and radio luminosity .",
    "reliable blr size measurements are now possible through reverberation mapping techniques ( blandford & mckee 1982 , recently reviewed by netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "high quality reverberation data and virial masses are presently available for about twenty agn , most of them seyefert 1s ( wandel , peterson and malkan 1999 , hereafter wpm ) .",
    "we combine the masses ( section 2 ) with whittle s bulge estimates in order to study the bbr in low - luminosity agn and compare it to mbhs in normal galaxies and quasars ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we derive a mbh - evolution theory that can explain our results .",
    "broad emission lines probably provide the best probe of s in agn . assuming the line - emitting matter is gravitationally bound , and hence has a near - keplerian velocity dispersion ( indicated by the line width ) , it is possible to estimate the virial central mass : @xmath1 this remains true for many models where the line emitting gas is not in keplerian motion , such as radiation - driven motions and disk - wind models ( e.g. murray 1998 ) : in a diverging outflow the density ( end hence the emissivity ) decreases outwards , the emission is dominated by the gas close to the base of the flow , where the velocity is close to the escape velocity .",
    "( note that if the velocity is actually larger than keplerian , the virial mass is an upper limit and the result that the seyfert galaxies in our sample have smaller   masses than mbhs detected in normal galaxies becomes even stronger ) .",
    "the main problem in estimating the virial mass from the data is to obtain a reliable estimate of the size of the blr , and to correctly identify the line width with the velocity dispersion in the gas .",
    "wpm use the continuum / emission - line cross - correlation function to measure the responsivity - weighted radius @xmath2 of the blr ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) , and the variable ( rms ) component of the spectrum to measure the velocity dispersion in the same part of the gas which is used to calculate the blr size , automatically excluding constant features such as narrow emission lines and galactic absorption . the line width and the blr size yield the virial `` reverberation '' mass estimate @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rms fwhm in units of @xmath5 .",
    "the virial assumption ( @xmath6 ) has been directly tested using data for ngc 5548 ( krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "the latter authors find that when the blr reverberation size is combined with the rms line width in multi - year data for ngc 5548 , the virial masses derived from different emission lines and epochs are all consistent with a single value ( @xmath7 ) which demonstrates the case for a keplerian velocity dispersion in the line - width / time - delay data .",
    "we use the wpm sample with the virial mass derived from the h@xmath0 line by the reverberation - rms method ( table 1 ) . for 13 of the objects in the wpm sample we obtain the bulge magnitudes from the compilation of whittle ( 1992 ) , who calculate the bulge magnitude from the total blue magnitude , using the empirical formula of simien & devaucolours ( 1986 ) , relating the galaxy type to the bulge / total fraction .",
    "the bulge magnitudes are corrected for the nonstellar emission using the correlation between h@xmath0 and the nonstellar continuum luminosity ( shuder 1981 ) .",
    "mkn 110 and mkn 335 have no estimated bulge magnitude in whittle s compilation , because they do not have well defined hubble types . for these objects",
    "we adopt a canonical hubble type of sa , which has a bulge correction ( @xmath8 ) of 1.02 mag . for mkn 335",
    "there is already a fairly large ( and therefore uncertain ) correction for the active nucleus ( 1.17 mags ) . for 3c120",
    "the bulge magnitude is taken from nelson & whittle ( 1995 ) who find a bulge magnitude of -22.12 .",
    "the uncertainties in the bulge magnitude were estimated from whittle s ( 1992 ) quality indicators .",
    "these indicators estimate the error in the subtraction of the nonstellar luminosity and some other factors , which for most galaxies amount to an uncertainty in the range 0.2 - 0.6 magnitudes . to the galaxies with an uncertain hubble type we assign an uncertainty of 1.2 mag .",

    "the narrow - line seyfert galaxy ngc 4051 , which has by far the lowest bbr in our sample , may indicate that narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies have smaller s than ordinary seyfert 1 galaxies ( wandel and boller 1998 ) .",

    "open diamonds indicate an unknown hubble type ( and therefore a large uncertainty in the bulge magnitude ) .",
    "the dashed diagonal lines are the average bbrs for normal galaxies ( magorrian 1998 ) and seyfert 1s ( this work ) .",
    "laor ( 1998 ) has studied the -host bulge relation for a sample of 15 bright pg quasars . estimating the bulge masses from the bahcall ( 1997 ) study of quasar host galaxies he admits the uncertainty in estimating bulge luminosity , dominated by the much brighter nonstellar source .",
    "laor estimates the   mass using the h@xmath0 line width and the empirical relation @xmath57 ( kaspi 1997 ) , where @xmath58 in units of @xmath59 .    as this relation has been derived for less than a dozen low- and medium luminosity objects ( mainly seyferts ) with measured reverberation sizes , it is not obvious that it may be extrapolated to more luminous quasars .",
    "the blr size is also dependent on the ionizing and soft x - ray continua ( wandel 1997 ) .",
    "the wpm sample ( which includes kaspi s sample ) indicates that the slope of the blr - size luminosity relation may flatter than 0.5 ; wpm find @xmath60 . if this result is correct , extrapolating the @xmath61 relation over two orders of magnitude ( the difference between the average luminosity of the pg quasars used by laor and kaspi s sample average ) overestimates the   mass .",

    "2 shows the three groups in the plane of  mass vs. bulge luminosity .",
    "the best fits and the corresponding standard deviations to the data in the three groups are ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) :    1 .",
    "normal galaxies ( magorrian 1998 , table 2 , excluding upper limits ) - @xmath66 , @xmath67 2 .",
    "pg quasars ( laor 1998 , all objects in his table 1 ) - @xmath68 , @xmath69 3 .",
    "seyfert 1s ( this work , excluding ngc 4051 ) @xmath70 , @xmath71    as a group seyfert 1 galaxies have a significantly lower bbr than normal galaxies and bright quasars .",
    "this lower value agrees with the remnant   density derived from integrating the emission from quasars ( chokshi and turner 1992 ) : @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 is the quasar luminosity function and @xmath74 is the efficiency ) , which compared to the density of starlight in galaxies ( @xmath75 ) gives @xmath76 ( shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "while seyfert 1 galaxies seem to have a lower bbr than bright quasars and the galaxies with _ detected _ mbhs in the magorrian ( 1998 ) sample , they are in good agreement with the bbrs of the _ upper limits _ and of our galaxy , and with remnant quasar .",
    "it is plausible therefore that the seyfert galaxies in our sample represent a larger population of galaxies with low bbrs , which is under - represented in the magorrian sample .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the distribution of   masses in fig .",
    "2 : the only mbhs under  @xmath77 detected by stellar dynamical methods are in the milky way , in andromeda and its satellite m32 , and in ngc 3377 ( the latter being nearly @xmath78 ) .",
    "these galaxies , as well as ngc1068 and at least two of the three upper limit in magorrian s sample do have low bbrs , comparable to our seyfert 1 average .",
    "actually for angular - resolution limited methods , the mbh detection limit is correlated with bulge luminosity : for more luminous bulges the detection limit is higher , because the stellar velocity dispersion is higher ( the faber - jackson relation ) . in order to detect the dynamic effect of a mbh it is necessary to observe closer to the center , while the most luminous galaxies tend to be at larger distances , so for a given angular resolution , the mbh detection limit is higher .    this may imply that magorrian s sample is biased towards larger mbhs , as present stellar - dynamical methods are ineffective for detecting mbhs below @xmath79 ( except in the nearest galaxies ) .",
    "the blr method is not subject to this constraint , making seyfert 1 galaxies good candidates for detecting low - mass mbhs .",
    "( note however that by the same token the wpm sample may be biased towards seyferts with low  masses , which tend to vary on shorter timescales and hence are more likely to be chosen for reverberation studies ) .",
    "consider mbh growth by accretion from the host galaxy .",
    "since the accretion radius , @xmath80pc ( where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the stellar velocity dispersion ) is small compared with the size of the bulge , we may assume the mass supply to the  is given by the spherical accretion rate , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the stellar ( or gas ) mass density in units of @xmath85 ( corresponding to @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 is the bondi parameter combined with a possible reduction factor due to angular momentum .",
    "integrating we find the time required for growing from a mass @xmath88 to @xmath89 by accretion of gas or stars , @xmath90 .",
    "for masses @xmath91 this is larger than the hubble time , so seed mbhs must grow by   coalescence which , even for dense clusters , is of the order of the hubble time ( lee , 1993 ; quinlan & shapiro 1987 ) . for densities",
    "as high as in the central parsec of the milky way ( few@xmath92 ; genzel 1997 ) or for ngc 4256 ( miyoshi 1995 ) accretion - dominated growth becomes feasible for masses as low as 100 - 1000@xmath93 .",
    "while the accretion rate is growing as @xmath94 and the growth time decreases as @xmath95 , the mbh eventually becomes large enough for accretion - dominated growth time @xmath96 .",
    "this phase may be applicable for the seyfert population . since the luminosity is @xmath97 , the eddington ratio increases as @xmath98 .",
    "the  growth slows down when the eddington ratio approaches unity , @xmath99 being bound by the eddington time , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the accretion rate that would produce an eddington luminosity . equating @xmath102 to @xmath103",
    "we find that the growth rate flattens at a bh mass of @xmath104 . in the -limited era , which may correspond to quasars",
    ", the growth rate is exponential , depleeting the available matter in the bulge on the relatively short time scale @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to an asymptotic bbr , which is likely to be similar for luminous quasars and their largest remnant mbhs in normal galaxies .",
    "this scenario predicts that on average quasars should have higher ratios ( near unity ) than seyferts , and larger bbrs .",
    "we can test the prediction from the data at hand . estimating the bolometric luminosity of agn with reverberation data from the lag ( wpm ) , and of pg quasars from the relation @xmath106 ( laor 1998 )",
    ", we find a correlation between the ratio and the bbr , with seyferts having ratios in the @xmath107 range and a low bbr , and quasars with eddington ratios close to unity and higher bbrs . from the ratio we can also infer the actual growth time , @xmath108 . for most objects in our sample @xmath99",
