    "[ sec : intro ]    l dwarfs with anomalously red near - infrared colors were first identified in the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) over a decade ago ( @xcite ) and have steadily grown as a population ever since . with some notable exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "these objects were generally found to possess low - surface gravity features in their optical and near - infrared spectra , pointing to ages much younger than the the vast majority of brown dwarfs in the field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the sample of red l dwarfs has ballooned ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as a result of all - sky infrared surveys like the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) , and visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) , inspiring new gravity - insensitive spectral classification systems , all - sky searches for young brown dwarfs , and infrared parallax programs to better determine their physical properties and relationship with young moving groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is now clear that these low - gravity brown dwarfs lie on a parallel sequence redward of the standard l dwarf locus in near - infrared color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "liu et al . ( 2016 , in press ) show that the ensemble of late - m and l dwarfs with very low gravity spectral classifications represent a `` fanning out '' of old field objects with the same spectral type ; later - type young l dwarfs are progressively redder and fainter in @xmath7 than their higher - gravity counterparts .",
    "this systematic offset and broadening of the l dwarf locus is likely caused by a combination of youthful overluminosity for late - m and early - l dwarfs and unusually dusty photospheres at later types that redistribute emergent flux to longer wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while this narrative may be qualitatively correct , no set of self - consistent atmospheric and evolutionary models",
    "can completely reproduce the colors and spectra of this fascinating population .    in parallel with discoveries of young isolated brown dwarfs ,",
    "adaptive optics imaging surveys have identified a similar pattern of redder colors and fainter absolute magnitudes among young extrasolar giant planets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the archetypal companion in this class is 2m12073932  b ( @xcite ) ; with a @xmath5@xmath4 color of 3.1  @xmath30.2  mag ( @xcite ) , it is the reddest ultracool object known and lacks the deep methane absorption expected at the effective temperature predicted by cooling models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , this empirically - discovered trait not predicted beforehand by atmospheric models is also seen in other red , low - temperature companions like hr  8799 bcde ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , 2m01222439  b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and vhs  j12561257  b ( @xcite ) , as well as young free - floating brown dwarfs near the canonical l / t transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) and may be caused by vigorous vertical mixing and strong disequilibrium carbon chemistry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a natural question that has emerged from these studies is the degree to which young isolated brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets share common atmospheric properties and cooling pathways .",
    "the physical properties of the lowest - mass brown dwarfs appear to broadly overlap with the most massive giant planets .",
    "however , if the initial conditions or compositions of these populations are substantially different from one another as a result of disparate formation channels then this similarity may be superficial and free - floating young red l dwarfs may not be `` exoplanet analogs '' after all .",
    "unfortunately , the dearth of known red l dwarf companions currently prevents this kind of comparison .    here",
    "we present the discovery of an extraordinarily red companion to the late - k dwarf 2mass  j22362452 + 4751425 .",
    "the host star was identified by @xcite as a candidate member of the ab dor moving group on the basis of its proper motion and uv emission from @xmath8 .",
    "our new radial velocity measurements of the primary are consistent with ab dor membership , implying a mass of @xmath11114  for the companion . at a separation of 3@xmath97 ( 230  au ) , 2mass  j22362452 + 4751425  b ( herinafter 2m2236 + 4751b ) belongs to two classes of rare and enigmatic objects : planetary - mass companions on",
    "extremely wide orbits ( @xmath10100  au ) , which have low occurrence rates of @xmath112% around young stars ( @xcite ) , and red l dwarf companions , of which only a handful are known .",
    "2m2236 + 4751b is likely to be an important benchmark for both populations .",

    "field rotation was small ( between 26@xmath17 ) in our 510  min sequences and the companion is outside the speckle noise - limited region close to the star , so no angular differential imaging subtraction was necessary .",

    "although it is one of the best - characterized nearby open clusters with a population of over one thousand stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , its very low - mass substellar members have been difficult to explore owing to their intrinsic faintness .",

    "show the pleiades l dwarf sequence in the @xmath5/@xmath5@xmath4 diagram generally resembles ab dor , progressively reddening to @xmath5@xmath4 values of @xmath12.5  mag , but then appears to turn over to bluer colors beyond @xmath5@xmath120.3  mag ( @xmath7@xmath114.7  mag ) and @xmath13@xmath117.8  mag ( @xmath100@xmath112.2  mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of 2m2236 + 4751b ( @xmath7=15.97 @xmath3 0.2  mag ; @xmath100=13.35 @xmath3 0.18  mag ) are over one magnitude _ fainter _ than the location of this apparent turnover .",
    "similarly , the two aforementioned red l dwarfs wise  j0047 + 6803 and 2m2244 + 2043 in ab dor have absolute magnitudes nearly half a magnitude fainter than this possible l / t turnover , suggesting that there is either an age discrepancy between ab dor and the pleiades , a dramatic level of photospheric diversity exists among brown dwarfs with similar absolute magnitudes at this age , or that some of the faint blue planetary - mass candidates identified by @xcite are contaminants .    compared to other companions , 2m2236 + 4751b appears to have even more extreme photospheric properties than all previously known objects except the @xmath05  object 2m12073932  b ( ( @xmath5@xmath4)@xmath6 = 3.0 @xmath3 0.2 mag ; figure [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "however , all isolated objects and companions in this region of the color - magnitude diagram show qualitatively similar atmospheric properties : red colors , faint absolute magnitudes , strong co absorption , and no signs of methane absorption despite having effective temperatures below the traditional l / t transition of @xmath012001400  k for the older field population ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite find that very thick clouds and rapid vertical mixing are required to reproduce the red colors and lack of methane absorption in 2m12073932  b , the most extreme object at the tip of the l dwarf sequence , and these traits are likely to apply to 2m2236 + 4751b as well . however , liu et al .",

    "2m2236 + 4751b reinforces the impression that there do not appear to be any obvious differences between the red , faint objects being discovered as companions and the analogous population of isolated free - floating objects .    with a projected separation of 230  au ,",
    "2m2236 + 4751b is the latest example of a growing population of planetary - mass companions on wide orbits of several hundred au ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of these objects is unclear ; planet - planet scattering ( @xcite ) , the tail end of disk instability ( @xcite ) , and turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds ( @xcite ) have all been invoked to explain their origin . @xcite",
    "argue against scattering as the dominant origin of this population due to the lack of additional close - in companions in these systems and the dearth of multiple massive ( @xmath110  ) planets uncovered at small separations in radial velocity surveys .",
    "in fact , because of their low numbers and lack of robust statistics , it is unclear whether these objects make up their own population or are part of a broader distribution of giant planets or low - mass brown dwarfs spanning small separations ( tens of au ) out to extremely wide separations ( thousands of au ) . unlike most of the wide planetary - mass companions currently known , 2m2236 + 4751b is part of a well - defined survey ( to be discussed in more detail in a future publication ) and will help clarify the statistical properties of planetary - mass companions on wide orbits around low - mass stars .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]    we have presented the discovery of a faint red l dwarf companion to the late k dwarf 2mass  j22362452 + 4751425 . the radial velocity and proper motion of the host star are consistent with the 120  myr ab dor young moving group .",
    "2m2236 + 4751a is relatively inactive , showing partly - filled h@xmath61 absorption but no x - ray emission or uv excess , suggesting that it is either in the tail end of the ab dor activity distribution or it is an older kinematic interloper in that group .",
    "the unusually red colors of the companion are similar to ( but more extreme than ) other mid- to late - l dwarfs in ab dor , possibly bolstering membership likelihood , but the existence of high - gravity brown dwarfs in this part of the color - magnitude diagram means that this trait is not uniquely a sign of younth and low surface gravity . assuming the pair is indeed a member of ab dor , the mass of 2m2236 + 4751b is 1114  from hot start evolutionary models and resides at a projected separation of @xmath0230  au at the kinematic distance of @xmath065  pc to the host star . if the system is a older kinematic interloper then the implied mass of the companion can be as high as @xmath174  at 10  gyr .",
    "the near - infrared colors of 2m2236 + 4751b are among the reddest known of any brown dwarf or giant planet . in near - infrared color - magnitude diagrams",
    ", it appears to mark the elbow of the ab dor substellar isochrone between other faint red l dwarfs like wise  j0047 + 6803 and 2m2244 + 2043 and the two t dwarfs gu  psc  b and sdss j1110 + 0116 .",
    "this implies that the transition from red l dwarfs to dust - free t dwarfs occurs between a narrow mass range of about 1113  at an age of @xmath0120  myr .",
    "the colors of 2m2236 + 4751b are redder than hr  8799  b but slightly bluer than 2m12073932  b , demonstrating that even intermediate - age giant planets can possess similarly extreme atmospheric properties beyond 100  myr .",
    "the 2m2236 + 4751ab system is well - suited for a broad range of follow - up studies .",
    "the age and mass of 2m2236 + 4751b will eventually be clarified with a parallax measurement of the host star from @xmath48 to establish whether the system is a member of ab dor .",
    "follow - up photometry of the companion at both shorter and longer wavelengths will better constrain its luminosity , spectral type , and atmospheric properties .",
    "both low- and high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy of 2m2236 + 4751b can be used to derive spectral and gravity classifications , independently age - date the system through gravity - dependent absorption line depths , measure its projected rotational velocity , and determine its composition and abundance ratios .",
