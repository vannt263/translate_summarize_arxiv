    "the super - conformal gauge theories living on d3-branes at singularities generally admit marginal deformations .",
    "a particularly interesting case of marginal deformation for theories with @xmath14 global symmetries is the so called @xmath0-deformation @xcite .",
    "the most famous example is the @xmath0-deformation of @xmath15 sym which has been extensively studied both from the field theory point of view and the dual gravity perspective . in particular , in @xcite , lunin and maldacena found the supergravity dual solution , which is a completely regular @xmath16 background .",
    "their construction can be generalised to the super - conformal theories associated with the recently discovered sasaki - einstein backgrounds @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "more generally , all toric quiver gauge theories admit @xmath0-deformations @xcite and , as we will see , have regular gravitational duals .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-deformed theories are interesting both from the point of view of field theory and of the gravity dual .    on the field theory side , we deal with a gauge theory with a deformed moduli space of vacua and a deformed spectrum of bps operators .",
    "the case of @xmath15 sym has been studied in details in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to a generic toric quiver gauge theory .",
    "the moduli space of the @xmath0-deformed gauge theory presents the same features as in @xmath15 case .",
    "in particular , its structure depends on the value of the deformation parameter @xmath0 . for generic @xmath0",
    "the deformed theory admits a coulomb branch which is given by a set of complex lines . for @xmath0",
    "rational there are additional directions corresponding to higgs branches of the theory .    on the gravity side",
    ", the dual backgrounds can be obtained from the original calabi - yaus with a continuous t - duality transformation using the general method proposed in @xcite .",
    "we show that it is possible to study the @xmath0-deformed background even in the cases where the explicit original calabi - yau metric is not known .",
    "the toric structure of the original background is enough . besides the relevance for ads / cft , the @xmath0-deformed backgrounds are also interesting from the geometrical point view .",
    "they are generalised calabi - yau manifolds@xcite : after the deformation the background is no longer complex , but it still admits an integrable generalised complex structure . actually the @xmath0-deformed backgrounds represent one of the few explicit known examples of generalised geometry solving the equation of motions of type ii supergravity .",
    "the extreme simplicity of such backgrounds make it possible to explicitly apply the formalism of generalised complex geometry , which , as we will see , provides an elegant way to study t - duality and brane probes @xcite .",
    "the connection between gravity and field theory is provided by the study of supersymmetric d - brane probes moving on the @xmath0-deformed background . in this paper",
    "we will analyse the case of static d3 and d5 probes , as well as the case of d3 and d5 dual giant gravitons .",
    "we will study in details existence and moduli space of such probes .",
    "we show that , in the @xmath0-deformed background , both static d3 probes and d3 dual giants can only live on a set of intersecting complex lines inside the deformed calabi - yau , corresponding to the locus where the @xmath18 toric fibration degenerates to @xmath19 .",
    "this is in agreement with the abelian moduli space of the @xmath0-deformed gauge theory which indeed consists of a set of lines .",
    "moreover , in the case of rational @xmath0 , we demonstrate the existence of both static d5 probes and d5 dual giant gravitons with a moduli space isomorphic to the original calabi - yau divided by a @xmath20 discrete symmetry .",
    "this statement is the gravity counterpart of the fact that , for rational @xmath0 , new branches are opening up in the moduli space of the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "our analysis also generalises the results of @xcite where it has been shown that the classical phase space of supersymmetric d3 dual giant gravitons in the undeformed calabi - yau background is isomorphic to the calabi - yau variety .",
    "the classical way to study probe configuration is to solve the equations of motion coming from the probe dirac - born - infeld action .",
    "generalised complex geometry provides an alternative method to approach the problem .",
    "as we will explain , a d - brane is characterised by its generalised tangent bundle .",
    "the dual probes in the @xmath0-deformed geometry can be obtained from the original ones applying t - duality to their generalised tangent bundles .",
    "the approach in terms of generalised geometry allows also to clarify how the complex structure of the gauge theory is reflected by the gravity dual , which , as we have already mentioned , is not in general a complex manifold .",
    "the study of brane probes we present here can be seen as consisting of two independent and complementary sections , one dealing with the born - infeld approach and the other one using generalised complex geometry .",
    "we decided to keep the two analysis independent , so that the reader not interested in one of the two can skip the corresponding section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the structure of the @xmath0-deformed gauge theory and of its gravity dual , and we characterize it in terms of pure spinors . in section 3",
    "we study the moduli space of d3 and d5-brane , static probes and dual giant gravitons , on the deformed background using the born - infeld action , while in section 4 we analyse the same configurations using the generalised tangent bundle approach .",
    "we will show that , as usual for bps quantities , the explicit knowledge of the calabi - yau metric is not required to extract sensible results .",
    "our analysis thus applies to the most general toric background . in section 5 we briefly comment about supersymmetric giant gravitons in the deformed background . in section 6",
    "we explicitly demonstrate through examples and general arguments that the results of sections 3 and 4 agrees with the field theory analysis which is performed in details . finally ,",
    "in the appendices we collect various technical proofs , arguments and examples .",
    "the entire class of super - conformal gauge theories living on d3-branes at toric conical calabi - yau singularities admits marginal deformations . the most famous example is the @xmath0-deformation of @xmath15 sym with @xmath21 gauge group where the original superpotential [ n=4 ] _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 - _ 1 _ 3 _ 2 is replaced by the @xmath0-deformed one [ n=4beta ] e^i_1 _ 2 _ 3 - e^-i_1 _ 3 _ 2 . a familiar argument due to leigh and strassler @xcite shows that the @xmath0-deformed theory is conformal for all values of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "similarly , a @xmath0-deformation can be defined for the conifold theory .",
    "the gauge theory has gauge group @xmath22 and bi - fundamental fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 transforming in the representations @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the global symmetry group @xmath28 , respectively , and superpotential [ conifold ] a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 - a_1 b_2 a_2 b_1 .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation corresponds to the marginal deformation where the superpotential is replaced by [ conifoldbeta ] e^i a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 - e^-i a_1 b_2 a_2 b_1 .",
    "both theories discussed above possess a @xmath14 geometric symmetry corresponding to the isometries of the internal space , one @xmath29 is an r - symmetry while the other two act on the fields as flavour global symmetries symmetry can be enhanced to a non abelian one in special cases .",
    "for instance it is @xmath30 for @xmath31 sym and @xmath32 for the conifold .",
    "in addition the conifold possesses a @xmath33 baryonic symmetry .",
    "a generic toric quiver , besides the geometric symmetry @xmath34 , presents several baryonic @xmath29 symmetries . in this paper",
    "we will only be interested in the geometric symmetries of these theories . ] .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation is strongly related to the existence of such @xmath14 symmetry and has a nice and useful interpretation in terms of non - commutativity in the internal space @xcite .",
    "the deformation is obtained by selecting in @xmath14 the two flavour symmetries @xmath35 commuting with the supersymmetry charges and using them to define a modified non - commutative product .",
    "this corresponds in field theory to replacing the standard product between two matrix - valued elementary fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 by the star - product @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the charges of the matter fields under the two @xmath29 flavour symmetries and [ wedge ] ( q^f q^g)= ( q^f_1 q^g_2 -q^f_2 q^g_1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation preserves the @xmath14 geometric symmetry of the original gauge theory , while other marginal deformations in general further break it .",
    "all the superconformal quiver theories obtained from toric calabi - yau singularities have a @xmath14 symmetry corresponding to the isometries of the calabi - yau and therefore admit exactly marginal @xmath0-deformations .",
    "the theories have a gauge group @xmath41 , bi - fundamental fields @xmath42 and a bipartite structure which is inherited from the dimer construction @xcite .",
    "the superpotential contains an even number of terms @xmath43 naturally divided into @xmath44 terms weighted by a @xmath45 sign and @xmath44 terms weighted by a @xmath46 sign _",
    "i=1^v/2 w_i(x ) - _ i=1^v/2 w_i(x ) .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed superpotential is obtained by replacing the ordinary product among fields with the star - product ( [ star ] ) and , as discussed in appendix b , can always be written after rescaling fields as @xcite [ defsup ] e^i _ i=1^v/2 w_i ( ) - e^-i _ i=1^v/2 w_i ( ) where @xmath47 is some rational number .",
    "it is obvious how @xmath48 sym and the conifold fit in this picture ; other examples will be given in section [ gaugetheory ] .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation drastically reduces the mesonic moduli space of the theory , which is originally isomorphic to the @xmath49-fold symmetric product of the internal calabi - yau . to see quickly what happens consider the case where the @xmath21 groups are replaced by @xmath29 s - by abuse of language we can refer to this as the @xmath50 case",
    "physically , we are considering a mesonic direction in the moduli space where a single d3-brane is moved away from the singularity . in the undeformed theory",
    "the d3-brane probes the calabi - yau while in the @xmath0-deformed theory it can only probe a subvariety consisting of complex lines intersecting at the origin .",
    "this can be easily seen in @xmath15 and in the conifold case .    for @xmath15",
    "sym the f - term equations read [ n4 ] _ i _ j = b _ j _ i , ( i , j ) = ( 1,2),(2,3 ) or ( 3,1 ) where @xmath51 . since @xmath52 are c - numbers in the @xmath50 case , these equations are trivially satisfied for @xmath53 , implying that the moduli space is given by three unconstrained complex numbers @xmath52 , giving a copy of @xmath54 .",
    "however , for @xmath55 these equations can be satisfied only on the three lines given by the equations @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "only one field @xmath52 is different from zero at a time .    for the conifold the f - term equations read [ confterm ]",
    "b_1 a_1 b_2 & = & b^-1 b_2 a_1 b_1 , + b_1 a_2 b_2 & = & b b_2 a_2 b_1 , + a_1 b_1 a_2 & = & b a_2 b_1 a_1 , + a_1 b_2 a_2 & = & b^-1 a_2 b_2 a_1 .",
    "these equations are again trivial for @xmath53 and @xmath50 , the fields becoming commuting c - numbers .",
    "the brane moduli space is parametrized by the four gauge invariant mesons x = a_1b_1 , y = a_2b_2 , z = a_1b_2 , w = a_2b_1 which are not independent but subject to the obvious relation @xmath58 .",
    "this is the familiar description of the conifold as a quadric in @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the f - term constraints ( [ confterm ] ) are solved when exactly one field @xmath61 and one field @xmath62 are different from zero .",
    "this implies that only one meson can be different from zero at a time .",
    "the moduli space thus reduces to the four lines [ conifoldlines ] y = z = w=0 , x = z = w=0 , x = y = z=0 , x = y = w=0 .",
    "we will see in section [ dualgiant ] using the dual gravity solutions and in section [ gaugetheory ] using field theory that for all @xmath0-deformed toric quivers the abelian mesonic moduli space is reduced to @xmath63 complex lines , where @xmath63 is the number of vertices in the toric diagram of the singularity .",
    "something special happens for @xmath0 rational .",
    "new branches in the moduli space open up .",
    "the @xmath15 case was originally discussed in @xcite and the conifold in @xcite . in all cases these branches",
    "can be interpreted as one or more branes moving on the quotient of the original calabi - yau by a discrete @xmath64 symmetry .",
    "we will describe these branes explicitly in the gravitational duals in section [ dualgiant ] .",
    "the field theory analysis of these vacua requires a little bit of technical patience and it is deferred to section [ gaugetheory ] .",
    "the general prescription for determining the supergravity dual of a @xmath0-deformed theory has been given by lunin and maldacena @xcite .",
    "the original background has a @xmath14 isometry and the prescription amounts to performing a particular t - duality along two @xmath29 directions commuting with the supersymmetry charges .    for a quiver gauge theory ,",
    "the undeformed gravity solution is a warped product of 4-dimensional minkowski times a calabi - yau cone over a sasaki - einstein manifold [ met4plus6 ] ds^2_10 = e^2 a ds^2_4 + e^- 2 a ds^2_6 , where the warp factor is @xmath65 . in all the formulae we are omitting factors of the radius of anti de sitter ( see footnote 3 at page 9 ) .    in the toric case",
    "these calabi - yaus have exactly three isometries and the lunin ",
    "maldacena method can be applied . in @xcite the @xmath0-deformation of the conifold and of @xmath66 spaces",
    "are explicitly computed using the known metrics for these sasaki - einstein spaces . in this paper",
    "we consider the general case of a toric calabi - yau cone .",
    "we will show that , as usual , most computations regarding supersymmetric quantities can be performed without knowing the explicit form of the metric .",
    "we will just need the general characterisations of the calabi - yau metrics given in @xcite which we now review .",
    "the geometry of a toric calabi - yau cone is completely determined by @xmath63 integer vectors @xmath67 .",
    "in fact there is a very explicit description of toric cones as @xmath18 fibrations over a rational polyedron described by @xcite [ cone ] c^ * = \\ { y^3 | l _ ( y ) = v^i _ y_i 0 , = 1  d } where @xmath68 are the inward pointing vectors orthogonal to the facets of the polyedral cone .",
    "the @xmath18 fibration degenerates to @xmath69 on the facets of the polyedron , @xmath70 , and further degenerates to @xmath19 on the edges ( intersections of two facets ) . as a simple example ,",

    "there is a nice relation between symplectic and complex coordinates given by [ change ] y_i= and , as the notation suggests , the function @xmath89 appearing in the complex coordinates form of the metric is the same as the function @xmath90 appearing in the symplectic form of the metric after changing variables from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",

    "the t - dual metric and b - field can be computed via buscher rules [ buscher ] e = g - b_2 ( d e + c ) ( a e + b)^-1 by embedding the @xmath106 transformation ( [ sl22 ] ) in @xmath107 [ olm ] o_lm = (    cc a & b + c & d    ) = (    cc id_6 & + 0 & id_6    ) , where the bivector @xmath0 is defined as = (    ccc 0_3 & 0 & 0 + 0 & i _ 2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) .    the choice of the two - torus introduces a four plus two splitting in the metric that can be made explicit by rewriting it in the following form [ metcy42 ] ds^2_6 = h_ab ^a_(0 ) |^b_(0 ) + z |z a , b=1,2 where @xmath108 is the metric on the two - torus and we have defined the one - forms [ chis ] ^a_(0 ) & = & dz^a + h^ac g_c3 dz^3 a= 1,2 , + & = & ( dx^a + h^ac g_c3 dx^3 ) + i ( d^a + h^ac g_c3 d^3 ) = x^a + i y^a + [ zeta ] z & = & e^i^3 dz^3 = with @xmath109 . the subscript @xmath110 is to distinguish these forms from the corresponding one in the t - dual background .",

    "if the d3-brane sits at a point where the two - torus @xmath280 shrinks to zero size , the generalised tangent bundle describing the new d - brane is identical to the one we started from , since the @xmath0-transformation ( [ olm ] ) reduces to the identity at these points . thus the original d3-brane is mapped to a d3-brane at the same degeneration point in the deformed background .",
