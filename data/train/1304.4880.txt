    "the metal - rich globular cluster ( gc ) ngc  6496 is located at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and galactic coordinates of @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the compilation by @xcite gives the following distances : @xmath9kpc from the sun , @xmath10kpc from the galactic center and @xmath11kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "the first color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  6496 was published by @xcite , reaching @xmath12mag below the level of its horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "the cluster harbors a prominent red clump ( rc ) , and its slight tilt was later interpreted to be the result of differential reddening across the cluster @xcite .",
    "indeed , the reddening maps of @xcitein this region give a range of @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15mag .",
    "the fundamental parameters that describe ngc  6496 have a considerable range in the literature . @xcite derived a metallicity of @xmath4}= -0.48 \\pm 0.15$]dex and a reddening of @xmath16mag . from washington photometry",
    ", @xcite deduced a much larger reddening of @xmath17mag and a metallicity of @xmath4}=-1.05$]dex , noting that increasing the reddening to @xmath18mag would result in @xmath4}= -0.80$]dex , a metallicity in better agreement with the estimates based on cmd features . in a study of six metal  rich gcs , @xcite present @xmath19 and @xmath20 photometry for the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the hb region of ngc  6496 , finding @xmath4}=   -0.48$]dex and @xmath21mag from the cluster s rgb color and slope . from new @xmath22 photometry , @xcite use isochrones to obtain @xmath4}= -1.03$]dex , @xmath23mag , assuming a distance modulus @xmath24mag and an age of @xmath25gyr .",
    "recently , @xcite used hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations with the f606w and f814w filters to determine a metal content of [ m / h]=0.5 , or @xmath4}\\simeq -0.7$]dex , @xmath26mag , a distance modulus of @xmath27mag and an age of @xmath28gyr , from isochrone fitting .",
    "the lack of consensus is not only confined to the cluster s metallicity , extinction , and distance .",
    "its classification as a disk or halo cluster is also uncertain .",
    "although originally ngc  6496 was believed to be a member of the gc disk system , its inclination was found by @xcite to be abnormally large for a disk cluster .",
    "a recent comparison of the shape of the ngc  6496 and 47  tuc main sequence ( ms ) suggests that the ngc  6496 is more metal - rich than what @xcite adopted , making it extremely unlikely that ngc  6496 is a halo object @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the ms comparison stops before the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) which is a particularly critical region to constrain theoretical isochrones , because the photometry of 47  tuc is saturated there .    in this paper we present results of @xmath0 observations of ngc  6496 using the soar adaptive module ( sam ) installed at",
    "the 4.1 m soar based on observations obtained at the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope , which is a joint project of the ministrio da cincia , tecnologia , e inovao ( mcti ) da repblica federativa do brasil , the u.s",
    ". national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) , the university of north carolina at chapel hill ( unc ) , and michigan state university ( msu ) . ]",
    "telescope at cerro pachn ( chile ) .",
    "these observations extend several magnitudes below the msto region , allowing new cmds to be constructed and interpreted .",
    "the next sections are organized as follows : in section [ sec : inst ] we describe sam . sections [ sec : obs ] and [ sec : calib ] describe the observations and the data reduction procedure . the color  magnitude diagrams and derivations of the fundamental cluster parameters are presented in section [ sec : cmd ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : sum ] summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "the soar adaptive module ( sam ) improves image quality by partial correction of turbulence near the ground @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet light from a pulsed laser scattered by air molecules is used to create the laser guide star ( lgs ) and to measure wavefront distortion with a 10@xmath2910 shack - hartmann sensor .",
    "the distortion is compensated by a 60-element curvature deformable mirror ( dm ) inside the re - imaging optics of sam which projects the uncompensated input focal plane of the telescope to the compensated focus of science instruments , with the same scale .",
    "the sam re - imaging system has substantial distortion , typical of optical relays with two off - axis parabolic mirrors .",
    "the uv laser light shortward of 370 nm is separated from the science beam by a dichroic .",
    "tip - tilt guiding is provided by two probes in the input ( uncorrected ) focal plane , using stars outside the main field and compensating tilts with the soar fast tertiary mirror .",
    "the sam can feed corrected images either to a visitor instrument ( e.g. the high - resolution camera , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or to the internal wide - field optical imager , sami .",
    "sami contains a single ccd with 4096@xmath294112 square pixels of 15@xmath30 m size from _ e2v_. the pixel scale is 45.4mas and the total field of view is 186@xmath31 across .",
    "the ccd is operated with the sdsu - iii controller which reads the full unbinned chip in 10s with a noise of 3.8 electrons ( without patterns ) and a gain of 2.1 @xmath32 .",
    "sami is equipped with standard bessell @xmath0 filters and the h@xmath33 filter with 655.9/64 nm pass - band .",
    "observations were taken as part of sam engineering tests , and a log of the observations is given in table  [ tab : journal ] .",
    "the loop was closed and opened several times with the tip - tilt guiding always on to characterize the resolution gain of sam . as the focus in closed loop ( cl ) was accurately determined , focusing in open loop ( ol ) was easily done by measuring focus with the lgs .",
    "the flatness of the dm in ol was assured by its calibration which accounts for variable gravity .",
    "therefore , the delivered image quality ( diq ) in ol was not degraded by the sam optics or defocus .",
    "data was taken without binning to increase the dynamic range of the ccd .",
    "the improvement in the diq from the use of sam depends on the strength of uncompensated turbulence in the upper atmosphere ( above a few kilometers ) . from the excellent and stable seeing in ol",
    "we infer that the atmospheric turbulence was weak , but likely variable . in future observations , the site monitor at cerro pachn will provide an estimate of the sky conditions ( this monitor was not working during our observations ) .",
    "sam provided a substantial improvement of the diq in cl , especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "the typical fwhm of stellar images in cl / ol condition ( averaged over the field ) was 0.48@xmath31/0.59@xmath31 in @xmath19 , 0.43@xmath31/0.66@xmath31 in @xmath20 , 0.32@xmath31/0.54@xmath31 in @xmath34 , and 0.31@xmath31/0.50@xmath31 in @xmath35 .",
    "this improvement is further illustrated in figure  [ fig : opvscl ] .",
    "here psf photometry is performed in two ol and cl images , as well as in two cl images .",
    "the consistency in the @xmath35 magnitudes is worse when introducing ol photometry , likely due to a greater number of unresolved stellar blends in the ol image .",
    "the photometry of central stars in ngc  6496 can be obtained to greater accuracy when using sam .",
    "similarly , fainter magnitudes can be reached with a more strongly peaked point - spread function ( psf ) in cl , resulting in a deeper photometry at a given exposure time .",
    "the images of ngc  6496 in cl show a trend of the diq in the east - west direction . in the worst case ,",
    "the fwhm in the @xmath35 band varies from @xmath36 in the western side of the image to @xmath37 in its eastern side .",
    "we believe this trend originates from a combination of two effects : guiding with only one probe and a delay in high - order compensation which displaces the best correction from the field center .",
    "the sharpest stars with the smallest psf are located closest to the guiding probe ; when guiding with two probes , the diq gradient is less steep .",
    "magnitudes derived by psf photometry for common stars found in two consecutive 120s exposures acquired in open and closed loop ( top ) , and in two closed  loop images ( bottom ) .",
