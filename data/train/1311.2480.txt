    "sio@xmath1 interface is a common feature in modern silicon - based complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) technology for the fabrication of integrated circuits . in the drive to scale devices to smaller sizes , channel lengths have been reduced to a few tens of nanometres  @xcite , with the properties of the device being determined by fewer than 100 dopant atoms  @xcite . understanding the effects of the interface on dopants",
    "is therefore an increasingly important concern .",
    "several experimental studies have reported the uphill thermal diffusion and segregation of arsenic atoms to the si ",

    "up to a monolayer of dopant atoms can be collected in this region  @xcite .",
    "studies using x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps )  @xcite , medium ion scattering ( meis )  @xcite and scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem )  @xcite have shown the dopants to be on the silicon side of the interface , despite initial suggestions to the contrary  @xcite .    while the majority of segregated dopants are deactivated  @xcite , giving rise to significant dose loss in the device and affecting the threshold voltage by up to 50%  @xcite , 1020% of them",
    "are estimated to be active  @xcite . in the context of device miniaturization ,",
    "understanding the properties of active dopants close to the interface becomes crucial  @xcite .    in this paper , we use first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) simulations to study arsenic impurities at si  sio@xmath1 interfaces .",
    "in contrast to previous first - principles calculations  @xcite that focus on defect configurations within a monolayer of the interface that passivate the donor and favour segregation , our emphasis is on understanding electrically active arsenic impurities in bulk - like , four - fold coordinated configurations at and near the interface .",

    "sio@xmath1 interface is itself a challenging problem .",

    "we use a large supercell of 472 atoms and consider both an idealized ordered interface of crystalline si with one of the crystalline phases of sio@xmath1 , and a more realistic disordered interface of crystalline si with amorphous sio@xmath1 .",
    "the former is generated by lattice matching the two crystals and introducing bridge atoms at the interface to ensure full coordination , while the latter is generated using a multiscale approach , based on a continuous random network monte carlo ( crn - mc ) model parametrized by dft .",
    "the large interfacial area in our disordered interface model enables us to place the as impurity atom at many inequivalent sites close to the interface , in order to build up a representative picture of the segregation of active dopants in the system .",
    "our main findings are that segregation is favoured to a small number of fully si - coordinated sites , and that the local atomic environment of the defect site has a substantial effect on the segregation energy . while there is also a long - range quantum confinement effect due to the proximity of the dopant to the interface",
    ", we find that this is a small contribution to the segregation energy .",
    "lattice relaxation is found to further enhance impurity segregation without causing donor passivation , although this effect is not sufficiently large to overcome the energy penalty associated with impurities being placed at partially or fully o - coordinated sites .",

    "[ sec : outro ] , we give a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "our model of a crystalline interface between si and sio@xmath1 was constructed using the method of pasquarello  @xcite .",
    "the supercell was obtained by attaching cells of @xmath2-cristobalite  @xcite ( with an 8% tensile strain for lattice matching ) to a @xmath3 si(001 ) surface .",
    "the bond density mismatch at the interface was corrected with the addition of o bridges between atoms in the surface layer of si ( two per si cubic cell ) , thus saturating the remaining dangling bonds ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : seg - ideal ] ) .",
    "the resulting tetragonal supercell , with 33 monolayers of si and 8 monolayers of sio@xmath1 , was then fully relaxed ( ionic positions and lattice vectors ) with dft , starting from a preliminary relaxation obtained on a smaller supercell with only 9 monolayers of si .",
    "for this we used the castep  @xcite code , with norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite in rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos ( rrkj ) form  @xcite , a plane - wave basis with a kinetic energy cutoff of 800  ev , @xmath4-point sampling of the brillouin zone , and the ceperley - alder  @xcite local - density approximation ( lda ) for describing exchange and correlation .",
    "our convergence tolerance parameters were @xmath5  ev /   for the maximum ionic force , @xmath6    for the maximum ionic displacement between iterations , @xmath7  ev for the change in the total energy / ion between iterations , and @xmath5  gpa for the maximum component of the stress tensor .",
    "the relaxation produced no noticeable change in the atomic configuration , and only a small decrease of the size of the supercell perpendicular to the interface plane , resulting in a negligible increase in density for sio@xmath1 .",
    "the final widths of the si and sio@xmath1 layers were @xmath042.5    and @xmath029.6   , respectively  -cristobalite interface includes only the @xmath8 oxidation state , in contrast with experiment .",
    "we have also constructed a similar ordered model using @xmath2-tridymite  @xcite , resulting in all the suboxide states being present at the interface ; however , it is not possible in this case to achieve an equivalent bonding topology at both interfaces present in the supercell due to the periodic boundary conditions , resulting in a large charge transfer of almost one electron per si cubic cell between the two .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the @xmath2-cristobalite system for performing the defect calculations . ] .",
    "for the more realistic disordered interface , we employed the canonical crn model for network glasses , first used in conjunction with mc techniques to simulate si  @xcite and ge  @xcite , and adapted later for the si ",

    "the mc simulations make use of a keating - like force field  @xcite and the single bond - switch trial move proposed by wooten , winter and weaire ( www )  @xcite .",
    "the model was parametrized by fitting the force field to dft total energy calculations of the entire si ",
    "sio@xmath1 interface supercell ; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first fully _ ab initio _ application of the crn - mc method to this system .",
    "the fitting was performed using an energy - matching procedure  @xcite .",
    "the snapshots were obtained from an initial mc run at high temperature ( @xmath9  ev ) using a parametrization from a previous study  @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 snapshots were taken from the entire run and used to fit the free parameters of the crn potential by minimizing the normalized root mean square error @xmath11 in total energy differences between all pairs of snapshots for the crn force field with respect to dft : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total energy of the system for snapshot @xmath14 given by the crn force field , and @xmath15 is the same quantity given by dft .",
    "[ fig : int_fit ] shows the result of this procedure .",

    "we performed simulations of the system containing a single as impurity ; as described in the next section , many different lattice sites were simulated ( including all the suboxide states of si ) .",
    "the segregation energy @xmath21 for a particular site is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total energy of the supercell with the dopant placed at the site of interest , and @xmath24 is the same quantity for the dopant placed at a reference site , in this case taken to be at the centre of the si layer ( i.e. , furthest away from the interface )  . only neutral defects are considered ; unless otherwise stated , no further relaxation is performed after the impurity is introduced into the system .",

    "the calculation of point defect properties with dft using the supercell approach has some well - known limitations  @xcite , particularly the slow convergence with system size of various quantities of interest , such as the defect formation energy  @xcite .",
    "however , we expect the segregation energy , being in effect a difference between the formation energy of the substitutional defect at two different lattice sites , to be less sensitive to system size than the formation energy itself .    although in this study we only consider neutral defects , it is also interesting to note that the definition of the segregation energy given by eq .",
    "[ eq : e_s ] in principle remains unchanged when considering the segregation of charged defects , under the assumption that the system is in equilibrium with an electron reservoir provided by the bulk crystal , and , hence , that a global electronic chemical potential can be defined irrespectively of the position of the dopant .",
    "this would therefore preclude the need for determining the electronic chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the limitations , our calculations of the substitutional as defect in a 256-atom supercell of pure bulk si ( similar to the number of atoms in the si layer in our interface supercell ) agree well with experimental results : the ionization energy ( calculated as the position of the stable charge transition level @xmath25 with respect to the conduction band edge ) is 47  mev , compared with a value of 49  mev from experiment  @xcite , and the relaxed as  si bond length is 2.43   , compared with values of @xmath26    @xcite and 2.43    @xcite from experiment .",

    "we can consider the energy barrier at the second monolayer as a migration or activation energy for the segregation process .",
    "we note , however , that the energy gain from segregation is modest : 0.11  ev for the site with a large negative strain , and only 0.03  ev for that with a small positive strain .",
    "all the defect sites belonging to the first regime have a negligible strain , being almost perfectly bulk - like in their local bonding environment both in terms of bond lengths and angles .",
    "we therefore assume that the increase in @xmath21 is a confinement effect due to the sio@xmath1 , affecting the long - range decay of the defect wavefunction .",
    "this effect is analogous to that shown in dft studies of semiconducting nanocrystals  @xcite and nanowires  @xcite , in which the defect formation energy for a substitutional dopant atom increases as the system size decreases .",

    "this effect depends only on the distance of the dopant to the interface , instead of on the detailed local ionic configuration around the defect site .",

    "these partially oxidized sites gain significantly more energy from relaxation than the si@xmath34 ones ; even for si@xmath49 , however , this is not sufficient to make segregation to these sites energetically favourable .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that even after taking lattice relaxation into account the number of oxidized sites favouring segregation will be negligible .",
    "finally , we have investigated the possibility of altering the segregation energy for as at interfacial sites through the application of a macroscopic uniform areal strain @xmath51 parallel to the @xmath29 direction .",
    "this areal strain is defined as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cross - sectional area of the supercell ( i.e. , the ( 001 ) plane for si ) , and @xmath54 is the equilibrium area calculated from bulk si . we restrict ourselves to si@xmath34 sites , and calculate the change in @xmath21 for variations in @xmath53 of @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to note that the reference energy @xmath24 from eq .",
    "[ eq : e_s ] also changes with @xmath51 ; this change needs to be calculated separately .",
    "we consider all sites found previously with a negative segregation energy : two for the crystalline system , and four for the disordered system .",
    "these calculations are performed without relaxation .",
    "additionally , we choose one site each from the crystalline and disordered systems , and perform full ionic relaxation in the presence of the areal strain .",

    "the crystalline system shows a small increase in @xmath21 with tensile strain for both sites , with almost no change due to relaxation .",
    "the disordered system , instead , shows a decrease with tensile strain for all sites .",
    "interestingly , sites with a small local strain exhibit a negligible effect from the macroscopic areal strain , while those with a large local strain exhibit an effect that is larger by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the application of tensile strain is predicted to favour the segregation of as to the interface , by increasing the stability of si@xmath34 sites in highly strained local configurations , which are naturally found predominantly in the interfacial region .",

    "our simulations on both a crystalline and a realistic disordered interface have revealed quite a rich and complex behaviour for this system , characterized by the interplay of various subtle effects .",
    "we draw a number of overall conclusions based on our findings :    * long - range quantum confinement of the defect charge at the interface ( affecting the long tail of the weakly bound donor state ) results in only a small barrier to segregation , on the order of 0.1  ev ; * the local bonding environment of the as impurity has a large effect on the segregation energy , with variations on the order of 1  ev for each oxidation state , and is thus more important than long - range effects that depend instead on the macroscopic position of the impurity with respect to the interface ; * partially and fully o - coordinated si sites carry a strong energy penalty that makes them unfavourable for as segregation , even after taking into account the substantial lowering of segregation energies by lattice relaxation for such sites ; * a small number of fully si - coordinated sites within the first three monolayers below the interface ( corresponding to a density of @xmath00.02  @xmath58 ) are found to be energetically favourable with respect to the bulk site , with the addition of lattice relaxation potentially further increasing this number ; * as dopants remain electrically active after segregation to si substitutional sites , and , therefore , can be used for nanoscale devices ; * the application of macroscopic tensile strain is observed to increase segregation to locally strained sites in the disordered interface , thereby allowing for a possible measure of control over the segregation process in experimental devices .",
