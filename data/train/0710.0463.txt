    "magnetic frustration have provided us with many intriguing topics e.g. the phenomena of order - by - disorder , the residual entropy at absolute zero temperature , disordered spin liquids , etc@xcite .",
    "there are a variety of models which are known to exhibit the so - called frustration effects . among them , the @xmath4 @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a square lattice has been extensively investigated over the last two decades as one of the simplest models to study how frustration destroys magnetic orders and stabilizes paramagnetic phases .",
    "the model is defined by adding antiferromagnetic interactions on diagonal bonds to the ordinary heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plafull ] ) : @xmath5 where the summations ( n.n . ) and ( n.n.n . ) are taken for the nearest - neighbor- and the second - neighbor ( diagonal ) pairs , respectively . in the classical ( @xmath6 )",
    "limit , the ground state is readily obtained by computing fourier transform @xmath7 of the exchange interactions and minimize it in the @xmath8-space :    * @xmath9 , @xmath10 : the ground state has nel antiferromagnetic order ( naf ) . *",
    "@xmath11 : the ground state consists of two interpenetrating nel - ordered square lattices .",
    "first quantum correction fixes the relative angle between the two ordering directions and selects the so - called _ collinear antiferromagnetic order _",
    "* otherwise : the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state is stabilized .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor ( diagonal ) interaction gives rise to no frustration and only the case with @xmath13 is non - trivial .",
    "the case @xmath14 has been extensively studied in the context of spin - gap phases stabilized by the frustrating interactions .",
    "chandra and doucot@xcite investigated the model in the large-@xmath15 limit and concluded that a non - magnetic ( neither naf nor caf ) phase appeared around the classical phase boundary @xmath16 .",
    "the most quantum case @xmath4 has been studied later both by numerical@xcite and by analytical methods @xcite ( for other literatures , see , for instance , refs . and references cited therein ) . by now",
    "it is fairly well established that we have spin gapped phase(s ) in the window @xmath17 although the nature of the spin - gap phase(s ) is still in controversy .    the case with @xmath18 , @xmath13 has been less investigated and recent analyses@xcite suggested that there is another non - magnetic ( probably spin - nematic ) phase around the classical boundary @xmath19 between caf and fm . from an experimental viewpoint , most compounds@xcite found so far correspond to the ordered phase ( caf ) of the @xmath20-@xmath21 model .    recently , kageyama _ et al . _",
    "reported@xcite a new two - dimensional cu - based compound ( cucl)la@xmath22 . in this compound ,",
    "two - dimensional sheets consisting of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are separated from each other by non - magnetic [ la@xmath22 ] layers and within each sheet the @xmath23 ions form a square lattice .",
    "the @xmath24 ions are located at the center of plaquettes and from a naive goodenough - kanamori argument the @xmath4 @xmath20-@xmath21 model with @xmath18 and @xmath13 is suggested as the model hamiltonian for ( cucl)la@xmath22 .",
    "what is remarkable with this compound is that inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite observed a finite spin gap 2.3mev(=26.7k ) above the spin - singlet ground state .",
    "subsequently , high - field magnetization measurements@xcite were carried out to show that magnetization monotonically increased between two critical fields @xmath26 t and @xmath27 t .",
    "the data for ( i ) the weiss temperature and ( ii ) the saturation field @xmath28 in principle determine the coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , none of the solutions @xmath29 obtained in this way reproduced the spin - gap behavior@xcite .",
    "therefore , the usual @xmath20-@xmath21 model does not seem to work .",
    "the second intriguing point concerns the magnetization process . from the standard scenario @xcite ,",
    "the onset of magnetization at @xmath30 in spin - gapped systems is understood as bose - einstein condensation ( bec , or superfluid onset , more precisely ) of the lowest - lying triplet excitation ( magnon ) and the lower critical field @xmath31 at @xmath32 is given by the spin gap @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "this bec scenario has been confirmed in various spin gap compounds@xcite .",
    "recent specific - heat- and magnetization measurements @xcite for ( cucl)la@xmath22 exhibited behavior typical of spin - bec transitions and suggested that the magnetization - onset transition at @xmath31 may be described by bec of a certain kind of magnetic excitations .",
    "however , we immediately find a serious difficulty when we try to understand this within the standard bec scenario ; the lower critical field @xmath35 t expected from the observed spin gap @xmath36mev at the zero field ( where the experimental value @xmath37 is used ) in the standard scenario is much larger than the observed value@xcite @xmath26 t .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that a lower - lying triplet excitation which is responsible for the bec was not observed in the neutron - scattering experiments because of selection rules .",
    "however , this seems unlikely since powder samples were used and usually one can hardly expect a perfect extinction of a certain triplet excitation in such powder samples .",
    "neither susceptibility measurements @xcite nor nmr data @xcite indicate such a hidden triplet excitation .",
    "an alternative and a more appealing scenario would be that the bec occurs not in a single - particle channel but in a multi - particle channel .",
    "that is , what condenses to support a spin - superfluid is a bound state of magnon excitations .",
    "the possibility of multi - magnon condensation has been proposed theoretically @xcite in the context of a _",
    "kinetic _ quintet bound state in the shastry - sutherland model ( see ref . and references cited therein ) .",
    "in fact , gapped quintet excitations which come down as the external field is increased were observed in the esr experiments @xcite carried out for sr@xmath38 , whereas small dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions hindered a quintet bec from being observed in that compound ( see also ref . ) .",
    "one of the simplest @xmath20-@xmath21-like models which realize the above scenario and have a finite spin gap would be the @xmath4 @xmath20-@xmath21 model with a plaquette structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plafull ] ) .",
    "a similar model ( @xmath39 ) has been investigated to develop a plaquette series expansion@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the region @xmath18 , @xmath13 where the quintet excitation is expected to play an important role in low - energy physics .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly recapitulate the problem of a single plaquette mainly to establish the notations .",
    "the coupling among plaquettes will be taken into account in section [ sec3 ] by two different methods : ( i ) a plaquette extension of the bond - operator mean - field theory@xcite and ( ii ) a perturbation expansion with respect to the inter - plaquette couplings .",
    "we find gapped triplets and quintet for small enough inter - plaquette couplings in both methods .",
    "for larger values of inter - plaquette couplings , one of the gapped excitations softens and the form of the effective interactions among the soft excitations determines the resulting magnetic phases . by using the gaps obtained in the perturbation expansion , we determine the semi - quantitative phase diagram in section [ sec : phase ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : souzug ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] ) .    the effect of high magnetic field will be considered in section [ sec : magnet ] . for high enough field compared with the spin gaps , we can approximate the low - energy sector by using only the singlet and the lowest excited state . for @xmath18",
    ", we may expect that the quintet touches the singlet ground state first and a multi - particle bec occurs . on general grounds ,",
    "a single - particle ( magnon ) bec phase is expected to have finite transverse magnetization .",
    "actually , in the bec phase of tlcucl@xmath40 , the transverse magnetization has been observed in the experiment@xcite . in the case of a multi - particle bec , however , the transverse magnetization does not appear . to investigate the magnetization process , we shall keep only the singlet and the quintet to derive a hardcore boson model as the effective hamiltonian valid in high enough magnetic field .",
    "a mean - field approximation@xcite will be applied to the resulting effective hamiltonian to draw a full magnetization curve .",
    "interesting phases ( a 1/2-plateau and supersolids ) will be discussed . according to the value of the parameters",
    ", we shall roughly classify the magnetization curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : magsouzu ] .    a summary of the main results and the discussion on the connection to the spin - gap compound @xmath3 will be given in sections [ sec : cucl ] and [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "the equations omitted in the text will be summarized in the appendices .",
    "we consider a spin-1/2 @xmath0-@xmath1 model with a plaquette structure where the interactions among spin-1/2s are explicitly tetramerized ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plafull ] ) .",
    "the model is made up of four - spin units ( _ plaquettes _ ) and the four sites constituting a single plaquette are connected by the nearest - neighbor- ( @xmath20 ) and the second - neighbor ( @xmath21 ) interactions as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plas ] ) .",
    "the inter - plaquette interactions ( both the nearest - neighbor- and the diagonal ) which connect those units are multiplied by a distortion constant @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "this parameter may be thought of as modeling the distortion of the underlying lattice in a simple way . in the case of @xmath43 ,",
    "this model reduces to the homogeneous @xmath0-@xmath1 model , while when @xmath44 , the plaquettes are decoupled from each other .     on these bonds.[fig : plafull ] ]     and @xmath1 between @xmath4 spins.[fig : plas ] ]      let us begin by analyzing a single isolated plaquette , which corresponds to the case @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenstates of a single plaquette can be easily obtained as follows .",
    "first we note that a plaquette hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . therefore , all the @xmath50 eigenstates are classified by the three quantum numbers as @xmath51 .",

    "finite inter - plaquette interactions @xmath41 induce various tunneling processes among plaquettes to change both the ground state and the excitations over it . for finite @xmath41",
    ", we calculate the excitation energy by two different approaches .",
    "one is the bond - operator mean - field theory ( mft)@xcite , which gives the excitation energy of the triplets @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "another is the second - order perturbation theory in @xmath41 , and it gives the energy of the quintet @xmath59 as well as that of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath41 , both approximations yield finite energy gaps for these excitations and when one of these gaps closes , the corresponding ( bosonic ) excitation condenses to form a magnetically ordered state .",
    "the energy of triplet excitations can be observed by inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "both approximations may not be reliable for large @xmath41 and small @xmath73 .",

    "we may assume that @xmath85 for each plaquette takes the same value @xmath87 for all plaquettes because of the translation invariance .",
    "next , we replace @xmath88 by its expectation value @xmath89 , since the @xmath88 boson condenses in the ground state .",
