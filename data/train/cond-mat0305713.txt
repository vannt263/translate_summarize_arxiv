    "in the past few years , tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in magnetic tunnel junctions consisting of two ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) electrodes separated by a thin insulator ( fm / i / fm ) has attracted much attention due to its promising applications in magnetic field sensors and magnetic random access memory @xcite .",
    "the tmr in fm / i / fm junctions depends on the degrees of electron spin polarization of the two fm electrodes @xcite , but the lack of nearly perfectly spin - polarized current , and temperature dependence of the polarization , have limited the tmr in these junctions @xcite . if we use half - metallic electrodes in the magnetic tunnel junctions , which are completely spin - polarized at @xmath0=0 k due to complications such as disorder and surface effects , half - metallicity is destroyed and thus the spin polarization and the tmr are decreased @xcite . however , by exploiting the spin filtering phenomenon , one can create 100% spin polarization and obtain a giant tmr .    the spin filtering effect in a ferromagnetic semiconductor ( fms ) has been demonstrated dramatically in spin - polarized tunnelling experiments @xcite . in these experiments , using an al / eus / al tunnel junction , moodera _ et al _ obtained 85% spin polarization for tunnel electrons . in another study with euse barrier junctions @xcite and in the presence of an external magnetic field , they reported near 100% spin polarization .",
    "more recently , leclair _ et al _ @xcite from the combination of a spin filter ( sf ) barrier and a fm electrode , obtained a large tmr in an al / eus / gd tunnel junction , which is a new method for spin injection into semiconductors @xcite . when a fms layer such as eus is used as a tunnel barrier , due to the spin splitting of the conduction band in the fms ,",
    "tunnelling electrons see a spin - dependent barrier height .",
    "thus the probability of tunnelling for one spin channel will be much larger than the other , and a highly spin - polarized current may result .",
    "although the tmr using other sf barriers has also been studied @xcite , the results have shown only little success .",
    "the tmr in single and double sf junctions has also been investigated theoretically in recent years .",
    "based on the two band model and free - electron approximation @xcite , li _ et al _ @xcite studied the tunnelling conductance and magnetoresistance of fm / fms / fm junctions .",
    "the results showed that a decrease or increase in tunnelling current strongly depends on the magnetization orientations both in the electrodes and in the fms layer . in another theory with double sf junctions , worledge _",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the tmr of the nm ( nonmagnetic metal)/fms / fms / nm junctions , using a simple model , and obtained a large magnetoresistance . in a recent paper , wilczynski _ et al _ @xcite investigated tunnelling in nm / fms / nm / fms / nm junctions in a sequential tunnelling regime .",
    "they found a strong enhancement of the tmr with increasing spin splitting of the barrier height in the ferromagnetic barriers .",
    "however , they have not investigated the effect of electric field and temperature on the tunnel currents and spin polarization .",
    "thus , other aspects of this structure , such as the voltage dependence of tmr , remain to be explained .    in the previous paper @xcite , using the single - site approximation for the nm / fms / nm / fms / nm double sf junction , we studied the effect of the thickness of the central layer on the spin polarization of tunnel electrons at @xmath0=0 k. we showed that the tunnelling spin polarization has an oscillatory behavior with the thickness , which is due to the spin asymmetry of the reflection at the fms / nm interfaces .    in this paper , using the transfer matrix method and the free - electron approximation , we have extended our previous work @xcite to investigate the effect of the thickness of the central layer , temperature and applied bias on the tmr for tunnelling through a double sf junction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the transfer matrix approach of the spin - polarized tunnelling through the double sf junctions is described . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical results for the tmr and the spin polarization of the tunnel currents are discussed .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the system we consider here is a nm / fms / nm / fms / nm sandwich structure in the presence of an applied bias @xmath1 , which is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . for simplicity , we assume the fms layers , which act as sfs , are made of the same material , while the outer nm electrodes , which are semi - infinite , and the central layer are made of the same metal .",
    "this structure is grown in the @xmath2 direction . in this case , in a free - electron approximation for the spin - polarized tunnelling electrons , the longitudinal part of the effective one - electron hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5=1 - 5 ) is the electron effective mass in the @xmath5th layer and @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the barrier heights of the left and right fms layer at above @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the barrier widths , @xmath12 is the width of the middle nm layer and @xmath13 . the third term in eq .",

    "the schrdinger equation for a barrier layer under the influence of an applied bias can be simplified by a coordinate transformation whose solution is a linear combination of the airy function ai[@xmath22 and its complement bi[@xmath22 @xcite . considering all five regions of the nm / fms / nm / fms / nm junction shown in fig .",

    "the degree of spin polarization for the tunnel current is defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 is the spin - up ( spin - down ) current density . for the double sf junction ,",
    "this quantity can be obtained when the magnetizations of two fms layers are in parallel alignment .",
    "the tunnel conductance per unit area is given by @xmath53 .",

    "the numerical calculations have been performed for a nm / eus / nm / eus / nm double sf junction in which , for simplicity , we assume that the eus layers have the same thickness @xmath57=0.5 nm .",
    "the appropriate parameters for eus which have been used in this paper are : @xmath58=16.5 k @xcite , @xmath59=7/2 , @xmath21=0.1 ev @xcite , @xmath60 m@xmath61 @xcite and @xmath62 + 0.75 ev . in the nm layers , the electron effective mass and the fermi energy",
    "are taken as @xmath63 and @xmath49=1.25 ev . here",
    "@xmath64 is referred to the free - electron mass . in this study",
    ", we calculate the spin currents , tunnelling spin polarization and the tmr by using eqs .",
    "( [ j])-([tmr ] ) , respectively . in our considered system",
    ", the magnetization orientation ( i.e. the @xmath15 spins direction ) in the left eus layer stays fixed but the other eus layer is free and may be switched back and forth by an external magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus ,",
    "when the magnetizations of two fms layers are parallel , spin - up and spin - down electrons see a symmetric structure , while for the antiparallel alignment these electrons see an asymmetric structure .",
    "this structural asymmetry results from the difference in the two barrier heights for each spin channel .",
    "figure 2 shows the tmr as a function of the thickness of the central nm layer at @xmath0=0 , 0.45 and 0.9 @xmath58 , when the bias voltage @xmath1=50 mv is applied to the junction .",
    "it is obvious that the tmr oscillates with increasing thickness @xmath12 and have well - defined peaks in which the tmr can reach 99% in some structures .",
    "the height of these peaks decreases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is related to the quantum - well states of the central nm layer and the spin - polarized resonant tunnelling . on the other hand , due to the temperature dependence of spin",
    "splitting in the eus layers , the barrier heights become spin - dependent , so that with decreasing temperature , this spin splitting , and thus the tmr , increases .    to understand the physical origin of the tmr and the oscillations , we study the energy dependence of the transmission coefficients through the double sf junction . in fig .",
    "3 , we have plotted the spin - dependent transmission coefficients at @xmath0=0 k for @xmath12=0.50 nm , which corresponds to a flat area between the peaks , and for @xmath12=0.72 nm , which corresponds to a local maximum in the tmr . because of the quasibound states in the central nm layer , the transmission coefficients reach unity at the resonance peaks which become sharper in the low incident energy region , since in this energy region the resonance levels are more strongly quantized .",
    "the results for @xmath12=0.50 nm show that there is one resonance level in the quantum well for both spin orientations and magnetic alignments .",
    "all these resonance levels are far from the fermi energy .",
    "however , the transmission coefficient for spin - up electrons in the parallel alignment is higher than the antiparallel alignment , and for spin - down electrons in both alignments .",
    "thus , there is a small difference in the current density @xmath65 ( = @xmath66 ) in both magnetic configurations , which gives rise to relatively small tmr at this thickness of the central layer . for @xmath12=0.72",
    "nm the resonance states shift to the lower energy side and a new resonance level slightly below @xmath49 appears , which is active only for spin - up electrons in the parallel alignment .",
    "therefore , there is a large difference in the current density @xmath65 in both alignments and consequently gives rise to large tmr .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "3(b ) and 3(d ) that , for each thickness @xmath12 , the resonance levels for spin - up and spin - down electrons in the antiparallel alignment coincide .",
    "the reason is that , for the antiparallel alignment , electrons with up ( down ) spin are easy ( difficult ) to tunnel into the central nm layer , and difficult ( easy ) to tunnel out of it ; thus , both the spin - up and spin - down electrons see the same effective height of the barriers during the tunnelling process through the whole system .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the tmr as a function of the applied bias at @xmath0=0 k for the thicknesses @xmath12 correspond to fig .",
    "3 . with increasing bias voltage ,",
    "the tmr for @xmath12=0.50 nm decreases very slowly because , in this range of the applied voltage , the discrepancy between the conductance for the parallel alignment and that for the antiparallel alignment increases only slightly . on the other hand ,",
    "the results show that , for @xmath12=0.72 nm at the beginning , the tmr slowly decreases with increasing the bias voltage",
    ". however , for the voltages higher than @xmath1=80 mv , it quickly decreases .",
    "the reason is that , at higher voltages , one of the resonance levels becomes active for both magnetic alignments which drastically reduces the tmr .",
    "it should be noted that , for very low values of the applied bias and the incident energy , a numerical instability is occurred in some of our calculations , which is due to the use of exact airy functions .",
    "this instability is overcome by using the asymptotic forms of airy functions @xcite and numerical analytical methods .    in fig .",
    "5 we have shown the spin polarization of the tunnelling current versus normalized temperature @xmath67 for single and double sf junctions to reveal the sf effects of the fms layers from another point of view . at high temperatures @xmath68 , there is no spin splitting @xmath69 in the conduction band of the eus layers and the transmission coefficients for two spin channels coincide .",
    "thus there is no tmr and spin polarization effect . as the temperature decreases from @xmath58 ,",
    "the barrier heights for spin - up electrons are lowered , while they are raised for spin - down electrons .",
    "this temperature dependence of the barrier height , which is attributed to the exchange splitting of the eus conduction band , greatly increases the tunnelling probability for one spin channel and reduces it for the other . in the parallel alignment , the tunnel current for spin - up electrons is much higher than the spin - down ones , which gives rise to the tmr and spin polarization effect . on further decreasing the temperature , this spin splitting and",
    "hence the difference in the barrier heights increases .",
    "therefore , the tmr and spin polarization reach the highest values at @xmath0=0 k. the highest value of the spin polarization for the single sf junction can reach 77% , which is qualitatively in agreement with the experimental measurements @xcite and the theoretical results @xcite , while for the double sf junction ( in the parallel alignment ) , it approaches 66% for @xmath12=0.50 nm and 99% for @xmath12=0.72 nm @xcite , which is due to the change in the positions of the spin - polarized quasibound states in the quantum well .",
    "therefore , one can see that , for the double sf junctions , the tmr and the spin polarization of the tunnelling current can be controlled by the thickness of the central nm layer , the temperature , and the applied bias .    in this study ,",
    "the numerical results obtained for the tmr and the degree of spin polarization can be compared with the result of wilczynski _ et al _ @xcite . as we discussed above",
    ", the enhancement of spin splitting @xmath69 in the conduction band of the fms layers can be obtained , when the temperature decreases . in this case , the tmr and the spin polarization increases , and this behaviour is in agreement with the result obtained by wilczynski _",
    "et al _ in the sequential tunnelling regime .",
    "based on the free - electron model , we presented a transfer matrix method for spin - polarized tunnelling through the double sf junctions .",
    "the effect of the quantum size , applied bias and temperature on the spin filtering and the spin transport process in the fms / nm double junctions are examined .",
    "numerical results indicate that the tmr oscillates as the thickness of the central nm layer increases . it is further confirmed that , for some thicknesses of the central nm layer , the spin - polarized resonant tunnelling can gives rise to large values for the spin polarization and the tmr , even at high temperatures ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "therefore , in the system presented here , it is able to select an appropriate applied bias , temperature and the thickness to achieve a maximum tmr and spin polarization .",
    "although the temperature for observing a 99% tmr is very low and the findings of the paper are not directly applicable to spintronics technology , the results may be useful in designing future spin - polarized tunnelling devices @xcite .    in the present model ,",
    "we have neglected the generally important complications , such as the interface roughness , electron - electron interaction , magnetic - domain wells , @xmath15 spin correlation , etc .",
    "these effects can play important roles in the spin transport process and reduce the efficiency of spin filtering ."
