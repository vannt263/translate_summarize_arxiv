    "one of the most important current questions in the field of star formation concerns the effect that environment and , especially , feedback may have on the star - formation process , in particular the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and the star - formation rate ( sfr ) or efficiency ( sfe ) .",
    "stars appear to form in two main modes .",
    "spontaneous star formation is the predicted result of the naturally turbulent molecular - cloud environment ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and is expected to produce a low background sfr . triggered star formation , on the other hand , is an increase in sfr or sfe due to the effects of a mechanical interaction on molecular cloud gas , usually caused by the winds , radiation or expanding hii regions associated with massive stars ( see e.g. @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are two main ways in which triggering might increase the sfe locally .",
    "the first is by creating new star - forming structures ( i.e.  dense cores ) , in addition to those forming spontaneously in the turbulent molecular cloud gas .",
    "this mode is most closely described by the _ collect - and - collapse _ mechanism ( @xcite , @xcite ) in which an expanding dense shell , driven into a cloud by winds or thermal expansion , becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments to form dense , star - forming clumps .",
    "the second mode works by increasing the probability that pre - existing dense  cores \" will collapse to form stars .",
    "this would usually require an increase in the ambient pressure , either from the passage of a ( shock ) wave through clumpy cloud gas , or when a core is overtaken by an ionisation front ( if ) .",
    "the latter mechanism is described by the radiatively - driven implosion ( rdi ) model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )    m. the black contours trace the @xmath0co j=1@xmath30 outline of the w3 gmc , as observed by the fcrao .",
    "the white straight line marks the approximate boundary between the hdl and ldl regions .",
    "the yellow crosses mark the positions of the o stars in the ic 1805 cluster .",
    "several regions of interest within the cloud are labeled.,height=317 ]    a third potential type of mechanism for influencing the sfe would include any that affect the efficiency with which dense cores convert mass into stars .",
    "this is the same as saying that the accretion history of already bound cores is affected by a change in the local environment .",
    "this might be caused by variations in local density and/or effective signal speed , which would alter the accretion rate .",
    "the w3 giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) offers a potential ` laboratory ' for constraining the mechanism by which feedback triggers new star formation and for quantifying increases in star - formation efficiency above the spontaneous background rate .",
    "both modes of star formation appear to exist within w3 , each dominating different parts of the cloud . thought to be a prime example of triggered , sequential star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , it stands on the western side of the w4 chimney / superbubble",
    "whose expansion is driven by the winds of the ic 1805 ob association ( figure [ fig : msxw4w3 ] ) .",
    "this expansion is compressing the eastern side of the w3 gmc and has created a high density layer ( hdl : @xcite ) within which there are several prominent star - forming regions ( i.e.  w3main , w3(oh ) and afgl333 ) .",
    "the rest of the cloud seems so far to have been largely unaffected by this interaction and the star formation within it should be mainly spontaneous .",
    "one notable exception is the kr140 hii region , located in the far south - west corner of the cloud , this may be an example of the spontaneous formation of an isolated massive star which is now triggering new star formation in a surrounding shell ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite surveyed two thirds of the w3 cloud , including all the hdl and the southern half of the remaining cloud , in the 850-@xmath8 m continuum and detected 316 dense cores with masses above 13 . dividing the gmc crudely into the two zones , they found that a significantly greater fraction of the total gas mass is contained in dense , potentially star - forming structures in the hdl ( 2537% , depending on assumptions about the clump mass function , or cmf ) compared to the diffuse cloud ( 513% ) , but detected no difference in the cmf between the two sections of the cloud .",
    "these results were interpreted as clear evidence of a collect - and - collapse type mechanism at work . however , this result was derived assuming a single excitation temperature ( 30k ) everywhere in the molecular gas traced by co j=1@xmath30 .",
    "if the gas temperature were significantly higher in the hdl than in the remaining cloud , then the contrast in gas mass ratio between the two regions may be lower than this analysis suggests .",
    "this paper presents new co j=3@xmath32 emission line maps of the w3 gmc and an analysis of the physical excitation of the cloud molecular gas , in particular the distribution of excitation temperatures , using matching co j=1@xmath30 data",
    ". the fraction of gas mass in dense clumps is then estimated as a function of position using the existing 850-@xmath8 m continuum results and is compared to the mach number of the turbulence in the co - traced gas .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : obs ] we detail the data reduction procedure for the co j=3@xmath32 data and describe the co",
    "j=1@xmath30 and scuba datasets . in section [ sec : analysis ] we describe our analysis and discuss the results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we present the conclusions of this study .",
    "the w3 gmc was mapped with the harp array receiver on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "harp is a 16-element focal - plane array that operates in the 325375ghz regime @xcite .",
    "the 16 receptors have @xmath914arcsec beams separated by 30 arcseconds , giving the instrument a 2-arcminute footprint .",
    "harp is combined with the acsis digital autocorrelation spectrometer backend .",
    "observations were made over three consecutive years ( 2006 - 2008 ) in @xmath0co , @xmath1co and c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 at 345.796 , 330.540 and 329.278 ghz , respectively .",
    "all observations were taken in good weather with the sky opacity at 225ghz in the range @xmath100.08 ( jcmt weather band categories 1 & 2 ) , using a bandwidth of 250mhz , giving a basic spectral resolution of 26ms@xmath11 .",
    "as the w3 gmc spans about 1@xmath12 on the sky , we split the cloud into 13 separate tiles of @xmath13 arcminutes , each requiring about one hour to map .",
    "all tiles were observed using continuous raster scanning and pointing observations were made between each tile .",
    "we used a sample spacing of 7.5 arcseconds and the raster scan spacing was half an array footprint .",
    "scans were aligned at a position angle of 70@xmath12 to the declination axis to match the known geometry of the cloud .",
    "we also observed small raster scan maps of crl 618 , crl 2688 and w3 ( oh ) to calibrate the science maps .",
    "the calibration factors applied in the segments of the maps were between 1.12 - 1.5 for @xmath0co , 1.7 - 3.04 for @xmath1co and 1.02 - 1.3 for c@xmath2o .",
    "the system temperature varied between 233k and 283k for @xmath0co with a median value of 242k ; 289k to 902k for @xmath1co with a median of 359k ; and 298k to 340k for c@xmath2o , with a median value of 324k .",
    "the mean pointing error was 2.43@xmath40.33 arcseconds for all the observations .",
    "the observing procedure differed slightly over the years as new observing modes became available .",
    "in particular , the great majority of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co maps have been scanned only along one direction , as the  basket weave \" mode of orthogonal scanning was not available at the time .",
    "the c@xmath2o map and later parts of the @xmath1co data were made using this mode .",
    "the velocity range of the cubes is @xmath14kms@xmath11 to @xmath15kms@xmath11 .",
    "the raw data cubes were filtered for spikes and , in @xmath0co , were binned by a factor of nine in the spectral axis to achieve a rms noise level of @xmath90.7k in a 0.23-kms@xmath11 wide channel .",
    "the @xmath1co and c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 maps were binned by a factor of 15 to obtain rms noise of @xmath90.4k in a 0.39-kms@xmath11 wide channel .",
    "the maps were spatially regridded with pixel resolution of 7.7 arcseconds and the spectral baselines were removed .",
    "the @xmath0co j=1@xmath30 observations at 115.271 ghz were made on 1999 may 714 and 2000 april 2428 at the five colleges radio observatory ( fcrao ) 14-m telescope using the 16-element sequoia array receiver and faas backend with 256 channels and 80-mhz bandwidth giving 0.8-kms@xmath11 resolution .",
    "system temperatures were in the range 600k to 800k producing rms noise of @xmath16k .",
    "the rms pointing correction was 5 arcseconds or less .",
    "these data and their reduction are more fully described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1co and c@xmath2o j=1@xmath30 lines at 110.201 and 109.722 ghz , respectively , were observed simultaneously using the expanded 32-element sequoia array on the fcrao 14-m on 2004 march 1623 march in  on - the - fly \" continuous raster mode .",
    "the target region was covered with 32 individual submaps which are fully nyquist sampled on to a 25@xmath17 grid with a spatial resolution of 49@xmath17 .",
    "the spectrometer was used with 50-mhz bandwidth centred on @xmath18kms@xmath11 , which results in a velocity resolution of 133ms@xmath11 .",
    "system temperatures were in the range @xmath19k for the duration of the observations . a fuller description of these data can be found in @xcite .",
    "all antenna temperatures have been changed to the @xmath20 scale using @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 is the forward scattering and spillover efficiency , taken as 0.77 for harp on jcmt @xcite and 0.70 for sequioa on fcrao @xcite .",
    "emission from the w3 cloud was found in the range @xmath23 .",
    "the velocity structure and dynamical state of the cloud will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "figure [ fig:12co ] shows the @xmath0co j=3@xmath32 emission integrated between 65  and 25 .",
    "these data cover the whole gmc , while the @xmath1co and c@xmath2o data in this transition cover a more limited area , slightly vignetting the northern and southern edges of the cloud .",
    "the integrated emission in these lines and in the three j=1@xmath24 transitions are shown in figure [ fig : coiso ] .",
    "figure [ fig:12co ] shows that , in addition to the warm dense gas around the active star - forming regions , @xmath0co j=3@xmath32 also traces most of the diffuse , extended emission seen in lower - level transitions ( figure [ fig : coiso ] , top right panel ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since the critical density of the j=3@xmath32 transition is expected to be between @xmath25@xmath26 at @xmath27k and @xmath28@xmath26 at 10k @xcite , slightly higher than that of cs j=1@xmath30 , and the j=3 energy level is @xmath29k above ground .",
    "the transition should thus trace the relatively warm , high - density gas associated with recent star formation .",
    "this may be explained by photon trapping caused by high optical depths which may be reduce the effective critical density .",
    "following @xcite we identify as the high density layer the eastern edge of the cloud , adjacent to the bubble blown by the ic1805 ob cluster .",
    "the w3 north , w3 main , ic1795 , w3(oh ) and afgl333 regions are located here . for the purposes of our analysis , and consistency with moore",
    "et al ( 2007 ) , this is separated from the rest of the cloud ( which we call the low density layer , ldl and includes the hb3 , kr140 and the trilobite regions ( see figure [ fig : msxw3w4 ] ) ) by a line defined as @xmath30 , in galactic coordinates .",
    "this division is somewhat arbitrary and based on the visible extent of the intense star formation in the eastern portion of w3 .",
    "however , while the definition of triggered and non - triggered cloud regions is not so clear cut , it is likely that the feedback effects from the w4 hii region will decrease in strength with distance from the ic1805 ob cluster . given that the average integrated intensity in the hdl is three times higher than that of the ldl ( 23 k km / s compared to 7 k km / s ) , we assume , in this paper , that the expansion of the w4 hii region has not yet affected these regions of w3 . therefore , star formation within the hdl , as defined by the equation above , is assumed to be triggered , whereas the ldl region is assumed to be dominated by spontaneous star formation .",
    "the three brightest and best - known star forming regions in the cloud ( w3 main , w3 ( oh ) and afgl 333 ) are easily identified in figure [ fig:12co ] , running from north to south along the eastern edge of the cloud . w3",
    "main ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) is the most prominent of these and the brightest source in the region at many wavelengths .",
    "oh and h@xmath33o masers have been detected towards sources irs 4 and 5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and it is the richest hii region cluster known within 2kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "we find a mean integrated intensity of @xmath34=307.5k@xmath35kms@xmath11 with a peak of 700@xmath35k@xmath35kms@xmath11 in the central area and @xmath955kkms@xmath11 in the more diffuse surrounding emission .",
    "the cloud associated with w3 main is seen to have rather complex physical structure , possibly shaped by the cavity situated immediately to the south which has been created by the winds from the young ic1795 stellar cluster @xcite .    on the other side of this cavity",
    "lies w3(oh ) ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , another active high - mass star - forming region and also the host of oh and h@xmath33o masers that point towards two centres of high mass star formation separated by 0.07pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular cloud associated with w3(oh ) is clearly elongated north - south , which is consistent with it being part of the large - scale , compressed shell produced by the winds of the nearby ic1804 ob association responsible for the w4 hii shell .",
    "its brightest regions have a mean integrated @xmath0co j=3@xmath38 intensity of @xmath39kkms@xmath11 with a peak of 300k , while the surrounding structure has a mean of @xmath980k .    south of w3(oh )",
    "is located the third active star - forming region in the hdl , afgl333 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "this cloud has a less well defined central peak than either of w3main or w3(oh ) and has a mean integrated intensity of @xmath42kkms@xmath11 .",
    "the rest of the w3 gmc contains less intense emission and less active star formation . on the south - eastern corner of the gmc ,",
    "the cloud associated with the kr140 hii bubble @xcite is easily identifiable .    between kr140 and afgl333",
    "is a region we term loops .",
    "the co emission in this area appears diffuse and generally has low integrated intensity ( @xmath43k ) . in the 850-@xmath8 m continuum , it appears as a long , fine , looped filament @xcite and in spitzer data is revealed to contain a string of infrared sources ( polychroni et al . in preparation ) . above kr140",
    "there is a region we call trilobite .",
    "it has a mean integrated intensity of 14.4k . here , again , @xcite find a number of dense cores at 850@xmath8 m , indicative of star formation .",
    "while this region seems rather cut off from the rest of the cloud there is a bridge of diffuse material that connects it to the kr140 bubble .        in figure",
    "[ fig : isotopes ] we plot the emission lines of the three isotopes in j=3@xmath44 from individual pixels in the four main regions of the cloud ( w3 main , w3(oh ) , afgl333 and kr140 ) .",
    "it is clear from the spectra that the @xmath0co j=3@xmath32 emission line is optically thick and self - absorbed practically throughout the cloud . @xmath1co",
    "j=3@xmath32 also tends to be optically thick and self - absorbed , but only in the brightest regions like w3 main or w3(oh ) . on the other hand c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32",
    "is very weak and we only observe it towards the brightest regions of the cloud ( w3 main , w3(oh ) and afgl333 ) .    throughout this study",
    "we assume that the co tracing the molecular gas of the w3 gmc is in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , at least in the rotation levels @xmath45 . where the optical depth is high , as is the case for @xmath0co emission along most lines of sight",
    ", the effective critical density will be reduced due to photon trapping .",
    "this means that , in reality , there may be somewhat different critical densities for different isotopologues , and the safety of the lte assumption may depend on the rarity of the co species .",
    "we ignore this in the following analysis but discuss it further below .",
    ".the channel widths of @xmath0co , @xmath1co , c@xmath2o j=1@xmath30 and j=3@xmath32 spectra . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : velchan ]    the 3d cubes of all emission lines were collapsed along the velocity axis between 65  and 25  and multiplied by the velocity channel width ( table [ tab : velchan ] ) to produce integrated - intensity maps for each species and transition .",
    "the j=3@xmath32 data were re - gridded to match the j=1@xmath30 maps so that there was a one - to - one pixel correspondence .",
    "the measured radiation temperature of a source is given , in terms of the excitation temperature @xmath46 and optical depth @xmath47 , by the solution to the equation of radiation transfer , in the absence of a background source : @xmath48 where , in lte , @xmath49 @xmath50 is the frequency and @xmath51 is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( 2.73k ) .",
    "hence , if the same @xmath46 is assumed , the ratio of the line brightness temperatures in the same transition from two different isotopic species is given by @xmath52 where @xmath47 is the optical depth of the more abundant species and @xmath53 is the abundance ratio .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath54 for the @xmath0co/@xmath1co abundance ratio . in this case , the results are not very sensitive to the choice of the value of @xmath53 , particularly where the @xmath0co optical depth is high . assuming @xmath55 , the numerator of equation [ eq : od_1 ] becomes approximately equal to unity , providing a first estimate for an iterative solution .",
    "we use this first estimate and the newton - raphson iterative method to solve equation [ eq : od_1 ] to calculate the velocity - averaged optical depth per pixel in @xmath0co and @xmath1co j=3@xmath32 and j=1@xmath30 .",
    "we find that the range of @xmath56 in both transitions is between 5 and 90 ( see figure [ fig : tau_distr ] ) . at high temperatures",
    "we expect that @xmath57 .",
    "however , globally , we find that this ratio is much lower , consistent with low gas temperatures .",

    "the ratio of the two can be used to derive @xmath46 , i.e.  for the @xmath0co j=3@xmath32 and j=1@xmath30 transitions , @xmath58 this recipe is obtained directly from equation [ eq:5 ] , assuming @xmath59 is measured over the same velocity interval and distributed similarly over that interval for both transitions @xmath60 .",
    "equation [ eq : tau_rat ] can not be solved analytically .",
    "instead , we used it to compile a look - up table of optical depth ratio values as a function of @xmath46 in the range 3 to 34k ( figure [ fig : txmodels ] ) .",

    "direct measurements of this abundance ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) can differ by factors of 3 to 5 which makes other sources of error , propagated from the @xmath47 and @xmath46 calculations , insignificant .",
    "however , this is a systematic error , and does not affect comparisons made within the map . in terms of random error ,",
    "the most well - behaved regions are those with the highest optical depth ( @xmath7220 ) , where uncertainties are of the order @xmath410@xmath73 per pixel . in regions with lower excitation temperatures ( @xmath7410 ) , for which the uncertainties in the optical depth produce higher relative errors , the uncertainty on the mass per pixel is , on average , @xmath420 @xmath73 .",

    "the co j=3@xmath32 emission line data are similar in mapping extent to the existing fcrao co j=1@xmath30 data as well as the scuba continuum observations of the cloud @xcite .",
    "the data contain a very large amount of detailed information on the physical state of the w3 gmc .",
    "this paper concentrates on the distribution of gas temperatures inferred from lte excitation temperatures and the results of subsequent calculations of the distribution of mass in the cloud .",
    "the velocity structure and dynamics of the cloud will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "our excitation temperature results are obtained by assuming that lte conditions apply throughout the gmc , i.e.  that rotational levels @xmath45 are thermalised , populated according to the boltzmann distribution which is dependent only on temperature .",
    "there are several caveats to this assumption .",
    "the first is that the critical density of the 3@xmath32 transition is quite high , as mentioned above , and it is quite likely that the mean density in the majority of the gas comprising w3 is less than this .",
    "where this is the case , the energy - level populations will be determined by the collision rate , and so by both the temperature and density of the gas .",
    "@xmath46 will then underestimate the kinetic temperature @xmath75 of the gas and the observed line radiation temperature @xmath76 will be less than predicted by lte .",
    "the effect on predicted column densities is complex .",
    "whether or not @xmath65 is under- or over - estimated depends at least partly on the gas temperature . at low @xmath75 ,",
    "an underestimate of @xmath75 may cause an overestimate of @xmath65 and at high @xmath75 the reverse may be true . at temperatures around 30k small errors in @xmath75 will have little effect .",
    "a second point to note is that the effective critical density of a transition may be lower where the optical depth is high and photon trapping becomes significant .",
    "this is likely to apply to the @xmath0co transitions across most of the cloud and to @xmath1co along high column density lines of sight and in the line centres .",
    "this effect may undermine the assumption of equal @xmath46 for the same transition of different isotopic species used to calculate optical depths .",
    "these issues notwithstanding , our method of deriving @xmath46 from the ratio of the optical depths of two different transitions of the same species , or from the line radiation temperature ratio where optical depths are low , has some advantages .",
    "firstly , the value of @xmath77 depends on the populations of all four energy levels and so the derived value of @xmath46 represents the distribution of energies relatively well ( being equivalent to a fit of the boltzmann distribution ) and should give a fairly robust estimate of column density , even if @xmath46 underestimates the real kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "secondly , equation [ eqn : radtrans ] contains , implicitly , the filling factor ( @xmath78 ) of the emission within the telescope beam , i.e.  the fraction of the beam area filled by the emitting gas . although @xmath78 may not be quite the same for different transitions , it will be accounted for , to first order , by using @xmath76 and @xmath47 ratios .    in other studies ,",
    "@xmath46 has often been estimated from the brightness temperature of a single transition , using equation [ eqn : radtrans ] ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the best method in the absence of data in other transitions , but the lte assumption then models only the relative populations of the upper and lower levels of the one transition used ( j=3 and j=2 in this case ) and does not account for @xmath78 , which may be quite small .",
    "the large - scale distribution of @xmath46 revealed in figure [ fig : tx ] contains few surprises . in general , we see higher temperatures ( @xmath7920k ) near regions of active star formation and cooler gas ( @xmath8010k ) elsewhere .",
    "we also see two large - scale temperature gradients , one running east - west across the whole cloud and the other along a north - south axis through the hdl . along the first axis",
    ", temperatures range from @xmath920 - 30k in the hdl down to @xmath94 - 9k in the central and western regions of the gmc .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. @xcite ) that in regions of high density the gas is in thermal equilibrium with the radiatively heated dust , whereas at lower densities molecular cooling dominates and the gas cools down through molecular transitions .",
    "therefore , this gradient is likely to be the result of lower densities to the west of the hdl as well as a gradient in the radiation field intensity .",
    "the second gradient ranges from @xmath930k in w3 main to @xmath910k in afgl 333 .",
    "since gas temperatures may be an indicator of the evolutionary stage of star formation within a cloud , this north - south trend may imply an age sequence .",
    "such an age gradient has also been suggested by @xcite who observed all three regions in atomic carbon .",
    "in addition to this , there are some detailed differences in the @xmath46 distribution within the three bright hdl regions . in w3",
    "main , @xmath46 peaks clearly in the middle of the associated cloud , coincident with the brightest ir and submm sources .",
    "the embedded ysos in w3 main therefore appear to be the dominant heating source in the cloud .",
    "the surrounding molecular gas may , in fact , be in the process of being dispersed by these centrally formed objects .",
    "w3(oh ) has a lower average excitation temperature of about 20k .",
    "@xmath46 is also centrally peaked in this source , although less clearly than in w3 main , and there are also high temperatures along its western edge , indicating that external heating may be important in this cloud .",
    "finally , afgl333 exhibits the lowest mean excitation temperature ( @xmath910k ) of these three regions and the @xmath46 distribution clearly peaks at the eastern edge , which is exposed to the radiation from the ic1805 cluster ( figure [ fig : msxw4w3 ] ) . assuming the embedded ysos become more dominant heating sources with time , these internal @xmath46 distributions appear to support the idea of an age gradient from north to south along the hdl .",
    "obtaining the distribution of @xmath46 has allowed us to derive the mass distribution of the cloud with much more accuracy than previous studies which assume a single temperature .",
    "our new estimate of the total mass of the gmc is @xmath81 , consistent with that of @xcite who obtained @xmath82 from @xmath1co j=1@xmath30 data , assuming @xmath83k everywhere .",
    "this agreement is despite most of the cloud having @xmath84k which , because we are below @xmath85k , should produce higher mass estimates .",
    "we find that the mass is almost equally divided between the hdl region and the remainder of the cloud ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively ) , even though the latter covers almost twice as much projected area as the hdl .",
    "we use the existing scuba observations of the cloud @xcite along with the masses derived above to calculate the fraction of gas in dense , potentially star - forming structures as a function of position in the cloud , i.e.  the clump formation efficiency ( cfe ) .",
    "the cfe is a time - integrated quantity and can be written as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the rate of formation of dense - core mass from the available gas of the cloud .",
    "therefore a high cfe can be the result of either a high average dense - core formation rate or of a long integration time .",
    "we have calculated the cfe for the area of w3 surveyed at 850@xmath8 m by moore et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "sub - millimetre flux densities are converted to gas mass using the standard formula , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the integrated flux density at 850@xmath8 m , @xmath92 is the distance to the cloud , @xmath93 is the mass absorption coefficient and b@xmath94 is the planck function .",
    "@xmath95 is the dust temperature , for which we assume a constant value of 20k , representative of the dust temperatures of dense cores derived from infrared seds ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "we assume a constant value of @xmath93=0.01@xmath96g@xmath11 @xcite and so a constant gas - to - dust ratio throughout the cloud .",
    "the scuba map is then regridded to match the co - traced mass data .",
    "the division of these two maps gives the distribution of the cfe across the cloud ( figure [ fig : cfe ] ) .",
    "m continuum data was available.,height=272 ]    as was found for @xmath46 , there are two large - scale cfe gradients across the gmc .",
    "one runs north - south along the hdl where w3 main with cfe@xmath923% and w3(oh ) ( @xmath920% ) exhibit higher efficiency in gas - to - clump conversion than afgl333 ( @xmath93% ) . in comparison ,",
    "the spontaneous star - forming regions in the western section of w3 have very low values of cfe , generally below 1% , creating a second , east - west gradient .",
    "the most obvious interpretation is that the high cfe values present in the eastern regions of the cloud , are the direct result of the interaction between with the adjacent expanding w4 hii superbubble .",
    "this is agreement with the results of @xcite who found that 26% of the gas has been converted into dense clumps with @xmath97m@xmath98 in the hdl , compared to 5% in the western regions of the cloud .",
    "they also found that the core mass function ( cmf ) of the cloud does not change significantly between the triggered and spontaneous star - forming regions of the cloud .",
    "there is clear evidence , therefore , that triggering due to the w4 expansion results in the creation of new dense structure ( clumps / cores ) across the affected regions that is able to form new stars .",
    "the common cmf of the two regions suggests that the triggering does not affect the star - formation process any further than that , i.e. triggering allows the formation of more more massive stars , but it does not alter the shape of the cannonical imf .",
    "this is in agreement with the collect - and - collapse model , where a trigger , such as the winds from massive stars , can create a shock that propagates through the surrounding medium , sweeping and compressing the gas adjacent to the forming bubble , creating new dense structure that can become gravitationally unstable along its surface on long timescales .",
    "the higher efficiencies measured in w3 main , compared to the w3(oh ) and afgl333 regions , can also be interpreted as due to different timescales . assuming that the triggering from the w4 bubble affects the three regions in a similar way , i.e. it increases the star formation rate to a similar degree ,",
    "then the difference of a factor of three in the clump formation efficiency between w3 main and afgl333 star - forming regions may be simply due to w3 main being older than afgl333 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of several studies that indicate multiple generations of star formation in and around w3 main ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the turbulent fragmentation model of star formation neatly provides a mechanism for the simultaneous support of molecular clouds against gravity on large scales and the formation of dense , star - forming cores in the collisions between turbulent flows on small scales , thus naturally explaining the low star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) usually found .",
    "a relation should therefore exist between turbulence and the cfe in a given cloud .",
    "@xcite use the @xcite star - formation rate ( sfr ) model , extended to a magnetised medium , to study the relationship between the sfr , the virial parameter , @xmath99 , and the sonic rms mach number .",
    "higher mach numbers mean stronger shocks , which should produce thicker , denser compressed regions as well as additional support against gravity on large scales .",
    "the relationship , therefore , is not a simple one .",
    "however , the models predict a weak negative correlation between the star formation rate and the mach number for turbulence - dominated star - forming regions .",
    "this implies that there should be more large - scale support against gravity where the turbulence is stronger , as expected .",
    "in order to investigate this prediction , we have measured the velocity width , @xmath100 of the j=3@xmath32 emission .",
    "unfortunately , the emission line widths are very much dependent on whether the line is self - absorbed and/or optically thick .",
    "thus , in this analysis we can not use the @xmath0co transition since it is largely both self - absorbed and optically thick .",
    "@xmath1co also suffers from optical depth effects towards the densest and brightest regions of the cloud and we , therefore , have to be very careful when using it to derive the velocity widths . generally , c@xmath2o is the best choice as it is optically thin , however , it is a weak line and we only detect it in the hdl regions of the cloud . for the @xmath1co j=3@xmath32",
    "we find that the line widths vary between 0.6 and 4.0km / s while for the c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 emission line they vary between 0.5 and 3.0km / s",
    ".    the total velocity dispersion in the molecular gas can be obtained from @xmath101 by deconvolving the thermal velocity dispersion of the co molecules , estimated from the sound speed @xmath102 , and convolving the thermal velocity dispersion of the mean molecular gas , i.e.  the sound speed @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 is the mean molecular weight = 2.8 , assuming solar neighbourhood abundances .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath75 can be estimated using the co excitation temperature @xmath46 obtained above ( where @xmath105 assuming lte ) .",
    "this results in @xmath106=0.2 - 1.3kms@xmath11 through the cloud which is systematically lower than the line widths calculated above for @xmath1co and c@xmath2o , confirming the presence of supersonic flows .",
    "if the velocity distribution is assumed to be gaussian , we can express the total three - dimensional velocity dispersion in the co - traced gas as    @xmath107\\ ] ]    where @xmath108 and 30 for @xmath1co and c@xmath2o , respectively .",
    "the mach number , @xmath7 , is given by : @xmath109 using equation [ eq : m2 ] , this can be written @xmath110 where @xmath111 for @xmath1co and 0.907 for c@xmath2o .",
    "normalised distributions for the hdl region as derived from @xmath1co ( red line ) and c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 ( green dashed - dot line ) and for the ldl region as derived from @xmath1co j=3@xmath32 ( blue dashed line).,height=200 ]    figure [ fig : mdist ] show the range of @xmath7 values in the ldl as derived from @xmath1co ( blue dashed line ) and in the hdl from @xmath1co ( red line ) and c@xmath2o ( green dash - dot line ) . from the @xmath1co it is clear that while there are higher values of @xmath7 in the hdl region the distribution does not differ significantly from that of the ldl .",
    "this is due to the effects of optical depth as well as higher noise in the more diffuse gas that the @xmath1co traces in bot the hdl and ldl regions .",
    "the c@xmath2o - derived mach number distribution , on the other hand , does not suffer from optical depth effects and suffers less from noise levels as it comes from the brightest regions .",
    "therefore it should be more indicative of the real @xmath7 distribution in the densest regions .",
    "the first panel of figure [ fig : mach2p ] shows @xmath7 plotted against cfe for the ldl region from @xmath1co j=3@xmath32 ( blue stars ) and the hdl region from both @xmath1co ( red crosses ) and c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 ( green triangles ) .",
    "note that we have included the @xmath7 calculated from all the pixels in all three maps , where there is signal , i.e. there are two velocity dispersion estimates for regions that have signal in both the @xmath1co and c@xmath2o maps .",
    "comparisons between the hdl and ldl regions are only possible in the @xmath1co as we have practically no detections in the ldl in c@xmath2o .",
    "to determine whether there is a correlation between @xmath7 and cfe we used the spearman rank correlation test for all the subsets . for the @xmath1co data in the hdl",
    "we find that despite the spread there is positive correlation significant at the 3 sigma level ( @xmath71=0.25 , t=6.7 , n=675 ) . in the ldl region ,",
    "on the other hand we find that there is no correlation between @xmath7 and the cfe ( @xmath71=0.066 , t=1.2 , n=240 ) .",
    "the spread in the @xmath1co j=3@xmath32 derived @xmath7 is because of the more diffuse material that surround the densest regions in w3 main , w3 ( oh ) and afgl 333 triggered regions . to minimise this effect and also to negate the effect introduced due to the @xmath1co lines being optically thick in the densest regions , we use the c@xmath2o line , as it only traces the most dense regions and is also optically thin .",
    "we find a tighter correlation between @xmath7 and the cfe significant at a 3 sigma level ( @xmath71=0.47 , t=850 , n=261 ) .",
    "we therefore find no evidence in the current data to support the prediction of @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the lack of correlation between @xmath7 and cfe in the western regions of the cloud , which should be dominated by spontaneous star formation , could be due to the small range in cfe values found there .",
    "the significant positive correlation found in the hdl can have two interpretations .",
    "it could be the result of the expansion shock produced by the w4 shell interacting with the gas in these regions , increasing the turbulent velocities and the efficiency with which the cloud has formed dense structure , in a way that is inconsistent with the predictions of turbulent ( spontaneous ) star formation .",
    "a more likely interpretation is that the increased degree of turbulence is an effect of the higher cfe present in these regions , coupled with their age , i.e.  it is due to feedback from the on - going star formation injecting momentum or kinetic energy , which results in higher measured @xmath7 .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mach2p ]",
    "we again plot @xmath7 , as derived from the c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 emission line against cfe per pixel , but separate the data into the three main hdl star - forming regions , w3 main ( red crosses ) , w3(oh ) ( blue stars ) and afgl333 ( green triangles ) , revealing that the relationship between these quantities is different for each region .",
    "spearman rank correlation tests on the three subsamples produce the results @xmath71=0.47 , 0.51 and 0.65 with t= 5.6 , 4.06 , 7.4 , and n=115 , 63 , 77 data points respectively , which are all significant at a level @xmath112",
    ".    a least - square fit to each of the three regions gives different results for each of them with gradient and intercept values of m=0.11@xmath40.02 and @xmath113=0.55@xmath40.01 for w3 main , m=0.17@xmath40.03 and @xmath113=0.56@xmath40.01 for w3(oh ) and m=0.26@xmath40.03 and @xmath113=0.57@xmath40.01 for afgl333 .",
    "we note , further , that while there is only a small difference of 1 - 2 @xmath114 between the slopes of w3 main / w3(oh ) and of w3(oh)/afgl333 , there is a larger difference of 3 - 4 @xmath114 between the slopes of w3 main and afgl333 .",
    "this change in the steepness of the slopes in the above correlations for the three different regions can be related to the evolutionary stage and state of each .",
    "if the observed turbulence were simply due to the mechanical interaction with the w4 expansion , and the cfe were determined by the turbulence , then all three regions should have more or less the same correlation between @xmath7 and the cfe .",
    "the change in the correlation between the three regions can be interpreted as a result of the on - going star formation affecting the cloud .",
    "feedback processes , like outflows or stellar winds from forming stars , have been acting on these regions for different lengths of time . in w3 main the slope of the correlation is flatter than in w3(oh ) , which again is less steep than that found in afgl333 . since w3 main is thought to be more evolved than w3(oh ) and afgl333 it follows that the flattening of the slope is likely to be because of cfe values produced by a longer star - formation timescale .     per pixel plotted against the clump formation efficiency in the hdl ( red crosses for the @xmath1co derived @xmath7 and green triangles for the c@xmath2o derived @xmath7 ) and ldl ( blue stars for the @xmath1co derived @xmath7 ) . *",

    "we find high excitation temperatures ( t@xmath118 ) in the eastern hdl region , where there is active star formation . in the remainder of the gmc the temperature rarely rises above 10k .",
    "we see a temperature gradient along the hdl , where star formation has been triggered by compression due to expansion of the nearby w4 hii region .",

    "we find that , in the regions affected by the expanding w4 hii superbubble , the cfe has values of 3 - 25% , much higher than that of the rest of the cloud that remains apparently unaffected , where values are less than @xmath91% .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0co , @xmath1co and c@xmath2o j=3@xmath32 maps of the w3 gmc made at the james clerk maxwell telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these observations with five colleges radio astronomy observatory co j=1@xmath30 data to produce the first map of molecular - gas temperatures across a gmc and the most accurate determination of the mass distribution in w3 yet obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we measure excitation temperatures in the part of the cloud dominated by triggered star formation ( the high density layer , hdl ) of 15 - 30k , while in the rest of the cloud , which is relatively unaffected by triggering ( low density layer , ldl ) , the excitation temperature is generally less than 12k . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a temperature gradient in the hdl which we associate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4@xmath40.4@xmath510@xmath6 , in agreement with previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> existing sub - mm continuum data are used to derive the fraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction , which we interpret as a clump formation efficiency ( cfe ) , is significantly enhanced across the hdl , probably due to the triggering . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure the 3d rms mach number , @xmath7 , as a function of position and find a correlation between @xmath7 and the cfe within the hdl only . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly - formed stars and a change in its slope between the three main star - forming regions is construed as another evolutionary effect . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that triggering has affected the star - formation process in the w3 gmc primarily by creating additional dense structures that can collapse into stars . </S>",
    "<S> any traces of changes in cfe due to additional turbulence have since been overruled by the feedback effects of the star - forming process itself .    </S>",
