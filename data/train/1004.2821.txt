    "many organisms use circadian clocks to anticipate changes between day and night @xcite .",
    "it had long been believed that these clocks are driven primarily by transcription - translation cycles ( ttcs ) built on negative feedback . however , while some circadian clocks can maintain robust rhythms for years in the absence of any daily cue @xcite , recent experiments have vividly demonstrated that gene expression is often highly stochastic @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of how these clocks can be robust against biochemical noise . in multicellular organisms ,",
    "the robustness might be explained by intercellular interactions @xcite , but it is now known that even unicellular organisms can have very stable circadian rhythms .",
    "the clock of the cyanbacterium _ synechococcus elongatus _ , for example , has a correlation time of several months @xcite , even though the clocks of the different cells in a population hardly interact with one another @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been discovered that the _ s. elongatus _ clock also includes a protein phosphorylation cycle ( ppc ) that can run independently of the ttc @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this protein modification oscillator @xcite , possibly in combination with the transcription - translation oscillator @xcite , is responsible for the clock s striking noise resistance .",
    "here , we use mathematical modeling to study how these two clocks interact in growing , dividing cells .",
    "we find that the ppc alone is very stable when cell growth is negligible , but it begins to fail as the growth rate increases , and for doubling times typical of _ s. elongatus _ it can not function without help from a ttc .",
    "we then use stochastic simulations to show that a ppc can , however , dramatically enhance the robustness of a ttc , especially when cells are growing slowly .",
    "the two mechanisms thus perform best in complementary situations , and it is likely that both oscillators are necessary to maintain even minimal clock stability across the full range of conditions and growth rates that bacteria encounter in the wild .",
    "importantly , the ttc and the ppc in _ s. elongatus _ are much more tightly intertwined than conventional coupled phase oscillators ; as a result , the combination of the two far outperforms not just each of its two components individually , but also a hypothetical system in which the two parts are coupled in normal textbook fashion  @xcite .    in _ s. elongatus _ , the central components of the clock are the three genes _ kaia _ , _ kaib _ , and _ kaic _ @xcite . under continuous light conditions ,",
    "the levels of mrna from the _ kaibc _ operon and of the protein kaic oscillate in a circadian fashion with a 6 hour lag between their peaks @xcite .",
    "overexpression of phosphorylated kaic abolishes _ kaibc _ expression @xcite , while a transient increase in kaic resets the phase of the oscillator @xcite .",
    "these observations led to the proposal that the kai system is a transcription - translation oscillator , with kaic negatively regulating its own transcription . in 2005 , however , kondo and coworkers showed that kaic is phosphorylated in a cyclical manner with a period of 24 hours , even when _ kaibc _ transcription is inhibited @xcite . still more remarkably , the rhythmic phosphorylation of kaic could be reconstituted in the test tube in the presence of only kaia , kaib , and atp @xcite .",
    "this raised the possibility that the principal pacemaker of the clock is not a transcription - translation cycle , but a protein phosphorylation cycle @xcite . yet , in 2008 , the same group showed that circadian oscillations of gene expression persist even when kaic is always held in a highly phosphorylated state @xcite .",
    "they thus concluded that the clock is driven by both a ttc and a ppc , and suggested that the interactions between the two oscillators may enhance the robustness of the clock @xcite .",
    "the ppc has been characterized experimentally in considerable detail .",
    "it is known , for example , that kaic forms a homo - hexamer @xcite , kaia a dimer @xcite , and kaib a dimer @xcite or a tetramer @xcite .",
    "kaic has two phosphorylation sites per protein monomer , which are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in a definite sequence as a result of kaic s autokinase and autophosphatase activity @xcite .",
    "kaia stimulates kaic phosphorylation @xcite , while kaib negates the effect of kaia @xcite .",
    "thanks to the wealth of available experimental data , the ppc has proven an unusually fruitful system for mathematical modeling @xcite .    the ttc appears to encompass several different regulatory pathways and is much less well understood .",
    "multiple lines of evidence indicate that circadian promoter activity can be achieved without any specific _",
    "cis_-regulatory element  @xcite , suggesting that the clock may regulate transcription at least in part through changes in chromosome compaction and superhelicity  @xcite .",
    "several proteins important for transcriptional regulation of the _ kaibc _ operon have also been identified . in particular , laba and the sensor histidine kinase cika",
    "have been implicated in negative feedback of phosphorylated kaic on its own transcription during the subjective night  @xcite , while the sasa histidine kinase , acting through the rpaa response regulator , seems to mediate positive feedback during the subjective day  @xcite .",
    "epistasis analysis suggests that laba may likewise act through rpaa  @xcite .",
    "the picture that emerges is thus that during the phosphorylation phase of the ppc , kaic activates _ kaibc _ expression , while in the dephosphorylation phase , it represses _ kaibc _ expression @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .    in this study , we perform stochastic simulations to investigate the roles of the ppc and the ttc .",
    "we first examine a situation in which the total number of each kai protein is _",
    "constant_they are neither produced nor destroyed  and only the ppc is operative . we show that in this case the ppc is highly robust against noise arising from the intrinsic stochasticity of chemical reactions . even for reaction volumes smaller than the typical volume of a cyanobacterium ,",
    "the correlation time is longer than that observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "living cells , however , constantly grow and divide , and proteins must thus be synthesized to balance dilution .",
    "in fact , dilution can be thought of as introducing an effective protein degradation rate set by the cell doubling time .",
    "we therefore next study a ppc in which the kai proteins are produced and degraded with rates that are constant in time .",
    "the simulations reveal that protein synthesis and decay dramatically reduce the viability of the ppc ; we predict that for a cell doubling time of 24 hours and a bacterial volume of 1 @xmath0 , the ppc dephases in roughly 10 days , much faster than real _ s. elongatus _",
    "the same loss of oscillations is seen even in the limit of infinite volume , indicating it is not due solely to noise . instead",
    ", the constant synthesis of proteins , which we assume are all initially created in the same phosphorylation state , necessarily injects kaic hexamers with the `` wrong '' phosphorylation levels at certain phases of the cycle  @xcite ; if these appear fast enough , they can destroy the oscillation .",
    "one role of the ttc is thus to introduce proteins only when the phosphorylation state of the freshly made kaic matches that of the ppc .",
    "our simulations of a combined ppc and ttc reveal that a ttc can indeed greatly enhance the robustness of the ppc , yielding correlation times consistent with those measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider whether the ppc is needed at all , or whether one could build an equally good circadian clock using only a ttc .",
    "we find that it is possible to construct a ttc with a period of 24 hours and the observed correlation time of a few months @xcite .",
    "however , this comes at the expense of very high protein synthesis and decay rates , which impose an extra energetic burden on the cell .",
    "our results thus suggest that a ppc allows for a more robust oscillator at a lower cost .",
    "although our models are simplified , we argue in the discussion section that our qualitative results are unavoidable consequences of the interaction between a circadian clock and cell growth and so should hold far more generally .    ,",
    "in recent years , the ppc has been mathematically modelled with considerable success @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "all models endow kaic with an intrinsic ability to cyclically phosphorylate and dephosphorylate itself , but they differ in how the cycles of the individual kaic proteins are synchronized . in this manuscript , we adopt the model developed by us @xcite , which is one of several based on a mechanism that we called `` differential affinity '' @xcite : kaia stimulates kaic phosphorylation , but the limited supply of kaia dimers binds preferentially to those kaic molecules that are falling behind in the cycle , allowing them to catch up .",
    "specifically , in our model each kaic hexamer can switch between an active conformational state @xmath1 , where the number @xmath2 of phosphorylated monomers tends to increase , and an inactive state @xmath3 , where @xmath2 tends to decrease ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) ; kaia stimulates phosphorylation of active kaic , but is sequestered by complexes containing kaib and inactive kaic .",
    "kaic in the inactive state can thus delay the progress of fully dephosphorylated hexamers that have already switched back to the active state and are ready to be phosphorylated again . with a and b denoting , respectively , a kaia dimer and a kaib dimer",
    ", the model becomes : @xmath4    this model reproduces the phosphorylation behaviour of kaic _ in vitro _ not only when all kai proteins are present , but also when kaia and/or kaib are absent @xcite .",
    "it moreover correctly predicted the experimentally observed disappearance of oscillations when the kaia concentration is raised @xcite , a success that strongly supports the idea that kaia sequestration is the primary driver of synchronization .",
    "our model does not feature monomer exchange between kaic hexamers , an alternative means of synchronisation @xcite that has been observed in experiments @xcite ; we and others find that monomer exchange is not critical for stable oscillations @xcite . in the _ supporting information _",
    "( _ si _ ) , we show that similar results are obtained with a model that focuses on the phosphorylation cycle of individual kaic monomers @xcite rather than of kaic hexamers and that includes a positive feedback loop .",
    "we quantify our model s robustness to chemical noise by performing kinetic monte carlo simulations of the chemical master equation @xcite . in our simulations , we vary the reaction volume , but keep the concentrations of the kai proteins constant at levels comparable to those used in the _ in vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite .",

    "cell  @xcite , corresponding to a roughly 6:1 kaic hexamer to kaia dimer ratio instead of the standard 1:1 ratio _ in vitro _",
    "it has been suggested that this discrepancy may indicate that the clock reactions are in fact confined to a subdomain of the whole cell from which some of the kaib and kaic molecules are excluded  @xcite ; here , we adopt this hypothesis and assume that the kai proteins are found in the physiologically relevant reaction volume in proportions comparable to those used in the _ in vitro _ experiments .",

    "[ fig : ppc_ttc_full]a shows , for the full ppc - ttc model , time traces of the concentration of rpaa , the sum of the concentrations of the kaic phosphoforms that activate rpaa , and the sum of those that repress rpaa ; for comparison , we also show the kaic concentration in the ttc - only model . in the ttc - only model ,",
    "the kaic concentration varies slowly , and the concentration threshold for _ kaibc _ repression is crossed at a shallow angle . in contrast , in the ppc - ttc model the concentration of active rpaa switches rapidly between a value that is well above the activation threshold for _ kaibc _ expression and one that is well below it .",
    "such sharp threshold crossings minimize the effect of fluctuations in the concentration of the regulatory protein on the timing of the switch between _ kaibc _ activation and _ kaibc _ repression .",
    "rpaa s abrupt switching is a direct consequence of the sharp rise and fall in the concentrations of the kaic phosphoforms that regulate rpaa .",
    "this in turn stems not so much from the oscillation in the total concentration of kaic , but from the phosphorylation cycle at the multiple phosphorylation sites of kaic : the concentrations of the various phosphoforms approach zero in certain parts of the cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_ttc_full]a ) , even though the total kaic concentration remains relatively large throughout ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_ttc]a ) .",
    "indeed , the stability of the circadian rhythm in the ppc - ttc model is mostly determined by the kaic phosphorylation cycle , which , as fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_only]b shows , is highly robust .",
    "it thus seems that the phosphorylation cycle is the principal pacemaker , even though a transcription - translation cycle is needed to sustain it and can , in fact , raise its robustness above the limiting value at zero protein synthesis and decay rate ( fig . [",
    "fig : ppc_ttc_full]b ) .",
    "the evidence is accumulating that circadian rhythms are driven by both transcription - translation and protein - modification cycles not just in cyanobacteria but even in higher organisms  @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that both cycles are required to generate stable circadian rhythms in growing cells over a wide range of conditions . on the one hand , it is intrinsically difficult for a ttc to generate oscillations when the average protein decay time is long compared to the oscillation period .",
    "indeed , the speed of protein degradation ( and/or dilution ) sets a simple upper bound on the size of any oscillation ; if only a small fraction of the proteins can be degraded in one oscillation cycle , then any modulation of the total protein concentration must necessarily have a low amplitude and so be very susceptible to noise . in cells",
    "whose doubling time is of order tens of hours ( comparable to the 24 hour clock period ) or longer , a ttc alone can thus function robustly only at the expense of high rates of protein synthesis and active protein degradation . on the other hand , a protein modification cycle must fail when protein turnover becomes faster than the clock period : proteins are then typically degraded and replaced by new molecules in the wrong modification state before they can pass through the full cycle , destroying the oscillation . while a ttc is thus required to sustain a protein modification cycle at higher growth rates , a modification cycle can also greatly enhance the performance of a ttc , especially at lower protein synthesis and decay rates , where the modification cycle can be exploited to set the rhythm of gene expression .",
    "the protein phosphorylation cycle of kaic is intrinsically very robust , because kaic is present in relatively large copy numbers and because a kaic hexamer must go through many individual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps in each oscillation period .",
    "these two characteristics together are responsible for the reliable and pronounced oscillations in the concentrations of the various phosphoforms of kaic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_ttc_full]a ) , which , in turn , drive the robust rhythm of _ kaibc _ expression .",
    "our combined ppc - ttc model is consistent with a number of experimental observations .",
    "it not only matches the average oscillations of the phosphorylation level and the total kaic concentration in wildtype cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_ttc]a ) , but also reproduces the observation that even in the presence of an excess of kaia , the total kaic concentration still oscillates with a circadian period @xcite ( see _ si _ ) .",
    "yet , because quite a few elements of the ttc have not been characterized experimentally , our model of the ttc is necessarily rather simplified and phenomenological ; not surprisingly , some observations thus can not be reproduced .",
    "for example , our model predicts that the phase of the oscillation in kaic abundance lags behind that of the phosphorylation level by a few hours , while experiments seem to show that these oscillations are more in phase @xcite . this may be due to our simplifying assumption that kaic is produced as fully phosphorylated hexamers .",
    "while phosphorylation of fresh kaic has been reported to occur within 30 minutes @xcite , fragmentary evidence suggests that hexamerisation is slow  @xcite ; one would then expect to detect kaic monomers in experiments several hours before our simulations report the presence of fully functional hexamers .",
    "we believe , however , that while our model is simplified , it does capture the essence of a coupled ttc and ppc : that is , it is built around a protein that not only regulates its own synthesis , but also undergoes a protein modification cycle , where the different modification states either activate or repress protein synthesis .",
    "moreover , the basic trends we observe can largely be explained by the arguments of the preceding paragraph , which depend only on the comparison of a protein decay timescale with the oscillation period ; we thus expect that our qualitative results should apply to any system that exploits both a protein modification cycle and a transcription - translation cycle to generate circadian rhythms .    in",
    "_ s. elongatus _",
    ", the period of the circadian rhythm is insensitive to changes in the growth rate @xcite .",
    "since protein synthesis and decay rates , on the other hand , tend to vary with the growth rate @xcite , the question arises whether the period of the oscillator as predicted by our model is robust to such variations . in the _ si _",
    "we show that a ten - fold increase in the synthesis and degradation rates of all proteins only decreases the period by 10 - 20% .",
    "the reason is that the period of the oscillator is mostly determined by the intrinsic period of the phosphorylation cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppc_ttc_full]a ) .",
    "the latter does not depend on the absolute protein synthesis and decay rates , although it does depend on the ratio of the concentrations of the kai proteins @xcite .",
    "clearly , it would be of interest to investigate how the ratio of the concentrations of the kai proteins varies with the growh rate .",
    "finally , how could our predictions be tested experimentally ?",
    "the most important testable prediction of our analysis is that the ppc requires a ttc when the growth rate is high .",
    "kondo and coworkers have demonstrated that a ppc can function in the absence of a ttc @xcite .",
    "these experiments were performed under constant dark ( dd ) conditions , which means that the growth rate was ( vanishingly ) small , protein synthesis was halted , and even protein decay was probably negligible , since the kaic level was rather constant @xcite .",
    "these experiments are consistent with our predictions , but the critical test would be to increase the growth rate while avoiding any circadian regulation of _ kaibc _ expression .",
    "this means that the cyanobacteria must be grown under constant light ( ll ) conditions .",
    "moreover , one would need to bring _ kaibc _ expression under the control of a promoter that is constitutively active . however , most promoters of _ s. elongatus _ @xcite , and even many heterologous promoters from _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite , are influenced by the circadian clock .",
    "nevertheless , a number of promoters have been reported that exhibit arhythmic activity @xcite , and these might be possible candidates . a still more challenging experiment would be to express the phosphorylation cycle in the bacterium _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our analysis predicts that in growth - arrested cells , the phosphorylation cycle should be functional , while in normal growing _ e. coli _ cells , with cell doubling times of roughly 1 hour , the oscillations should cease to exist .",
