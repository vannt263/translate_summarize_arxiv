    "the well - known non - renormalization theorem @xcite states that in @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories the superpotential does not receive divergent quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , there is one more interesting feature of quantum corrections in these theories .",
    "namely , the renormalization of the coupling constant is related to the renormalization of the matter superfields by the so - called exact nsvz @xmath1-function @xcite .",
    "for the general @xmath0 supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theory with matter it is written as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the anomalous dimension of the chiral matter superfields and the following notation is used :    @xmath4    ( it is assumed that the generators of the fundamental representation @xmath5 are normalized by the condition @xmath6 . )    in the early papers the nsvz @xmath1-function was obtained from general arguments , such as the structure of instanton contributions to the effective action @xcite , anomalies @xcite , non - renormalization of the topological term @xcite .",
    "however , it was also necessary to construct the subtraction scheme in which the nsvz @xmath1-function is valid .",
    "the explicit loop calculations @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) made with the dimensional reduction @xcite in the @xmath7-scheme agree with the nsvz @xmath1-function only after a special finite renormalization which should be constructed in each order @xcite . up to now",
    ", there is no general prescription how to do it in an arbitrary order .",
    "however , a possibility of making this finite renormalization is nontrivial @xcite , because from the general equation which describes how the nsvz expression is changed under a finite renormalization @xcite one can derive some scheme independent consequences of the nsvz relation @xcite .    at least in the abelian case",
    ", the nsvz scheme can be naturally constructed if the supersymmetric theories are regularized by higher covariant derivatives @xcite .",
    "this regularization is mathematically consistent unlike the dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "( removing the inconsistencies of the dimensional reduction leads to the loss of the explicit supersymmetry @xcite , which can be in this case broken by higher order quantum corrections @xcite . )",
    "the higher covariant derivative regularization can be formulated in the explicitly @xmath0 supersymmetric way @xcite , so that it does not break supersymmetry .",
    "it can be also used for regularization of @xmath8 supersymmetric theories @xcite .    with the higher covariant derivative regularization",
    "the nsvz relation was derived for the abelian supersymmetric theories in all orders for the renormalization group ( rg ) functions defined in terms of the bare coupling constant @xcite ( which are scheme - independent for a fixed regularization @xcite ) .",
    "the rg functions defined in the standard way in terms of the renormalized coupling constant @xcite satisfy the nsvz relation only in the nsvz scheme which in this case can be constructed in all orders by imposing simple boundary conditions on the renormalization constants @xcite .",
    "thus , the nsvz scheme can be easily constructed with the slavnov higher derivative regularization .",
    "the main feature of quantum corrections , which allows to do this , is the factorization of integrals for the @xmath1-function ( defined in terms of the bare coupling constant ) into integrals of ( double ) total derivatives in the momentum space in the limit of the vanishing external momentum @xcite . in the abelian case",
    "this has been proved in all orders @xcite and confirmed by explicit calculations in the three - loop approximation @xcite . using a similar method",
    "it has been proved that the integrals for the adler @xmath9-function @xcite ( defined in terms of the bare coupling constant ) in @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd are also integrals of double total derivatives in all orders .",
    "this feature allows to relate this function to the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields exactly in all orders @xcite .",
    "this new relation is similar to the nsvz @xmath1-function and has a similar origin .    in the non - abelian case",
    "the calculations of the @xmath1-function with the higher covariant derivative regularization were made only in the two - loop order @xcite , where it was demonstrated that all momentum integrals giving the @xmath1-function are integrals of total derivatives .",
    "subsequently , the results of the papers @xcite were written in the form of integrals of double total derivatives @xcite",
    ". however , the versions of the higher covariant derivative regularization which were used for making explicit calculations for the non - abelian @xmath0 supersymmetric theories break the brst invariance @xcite ( while the background gauge invariance is not broken ) . then the calculations are much simpler in comparison with the version of the higher derivative regularization which does not break the brst invariance .",
    "certainly , using of non - invariant regularizations is possible ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , if they are supplemented by a subtraction scheme which restores the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities @xcite .",
    "however , it is much more convenient to make calculations with the invariant regularization .",
    "moreover , the invariant regularization may be useful for the general derivation of the nsvz relation in the non - abelian case .",
    "that is why in the present paper we consider a more complicated version of the higher derivative regularization which does not break the brst invariance and a very general forms of the higher derivative term and of the gauge fixing term . in this case",
    "the calculations are much more complicated .",
    "that is why here we make them only in the one - loop approximation .",
    "certainly , in the one - loop approximation the higher derivative regularization always gives the result which is in agreement with other regularizations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the one - loop calculations can be used for demonstrating the factorization of integrals which give the @xmath1-function into integrals of double total derivatives .",
    "moreover , they allow to verify the method of calculations and fix some potential problems .",
    "for example , the first calculation of the quantum corrections made with the higher covariant derivative regularization for the ( non - supersymmetric ) yang  mills theory @xcite gave the correct result for the one - loop @xmath1-function @xcite only after corrections made in @xcite .",
    "( one - loop quantum corrections in non - supersymmetric electrodynamics with the higher derivative term were also recently investigated in @xcite . )",
    "there are also other subtleties in calculating quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one more important reason for making the one - loop calculation is that for deriving the nsvz relation by the direct summation of supergraphs in all orders ( such as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) this approximation should be considered separately and the brst invariant regularization is highly desirable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section_sym ] we regularize the @xmath0 sym theory by higher covariant derivatives without breaking the brst invariance and construct the generating functional for the regularized theory . in sect .",

    "also the considered theory is invariant under the quantum gauge transformations    @xmath31    the parameter @xmath32 of the quantum gauge transformations is a background chiral superfield which , by definition , satisfies the condition    @xmath33    where the gauge and supersymmetric background covariant derivatives are defined by    @xmath34    acting on a superfield @xmath35 which transforms as @xmath36 under the background gauge symmetry ( [ background_invariance ] ) they will have the same transformation law , e.g. , @xmath37 .",
    "after the substitution ( [ background_splitting ] ) the superfield strength @xmath38 will have the form    @xmath39    where we introduce the notation    @xmath40    it is convenient to fix a gauge and introduce a regularization in such a way that the invariance ( [ background_invariance ] ) remains unbroken .",
    "then the effective action will be also invariant under the transformations ( [ background_invariance ] ) , which is very convenient for calculating rg functions .      [ subsection_sym_hd ]    the main idea of the higher covariant derivative regularization is adding a term with higher degrees of the covariant derivatives ( which we will denote by @xmath41 ) to the classical action . certainly , such a term is not uniquely defined .",
    "there are a lot of options for choosing it . here , for definiteness , we will use the following expression :    @xmath42_{adj } e^{\\omega } e^{\\bm{\\omega } } w_a e^{-\\bm{\\omega } } e^{-\\omega}\\qquad\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4 } \\int d^4x\\ , d^4\\theta\\,\\phi^+ e^{\\bm{\\omega}^+ } e^{\\omega^+ } \\big[f\\big(-\\frac{\\bar\\nabla^2 \\nabla^2}{16\\lambda^2}\\big)-1\\big ] e^{\\omega } e^{\\bm{\\omega } } \\phi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the gauge and supersymmetric covariant derivatives here are given by    @xmath43    the subscript @xmath44 points out that they act on superfields in the adjoint representation .",

    "one can verify that the expression ( [ action_hd ] ) is invariant both under the background gauge transformations ( [ background_invariance ] ) and under the quantum gauge transformations ( [ quantum_invariance ] ) .",
    "taking into account that    @xmath51    for an arbitrary chiral superfield @xmath52 , we see that in the lowest order in the ( background and quantum ) gauge superfields the regulators give @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "in this paper we consider a general @xmath0 sym theory with matter regularized by a very general version of the higher derivative regularization which does not break the brst invariance and calculate all rg functions in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the considered version of the higher derivative regularization was not earlier used to obtain quantum corrections , because it leads to very complicated calculations .",
    "however , it does not break symmetries of the theory and seems to be very useful for the general derivation of the nsvz @xmath1-function in the non - abelian case by the direct summation of supergraphs . making such a derivation one should consider the one - loop approximation separately , and this problem is addressed in this paper . in particular ,",
    "we have demonstrated that all one - loop momentum integrals for the @xmath1-function are integrals of double total derivatives independently of the form of the higher derivative term .",
    "this seems to be a general feature of all supersymmetric theories .",
    "supersymmetric theories regularized by the dimensional reduction were considered in @xcite . ] certainly , the result of the calculation coincided with the well - known expression for the one - loop @xmath1-function in the supersymmetric case .",
    "also we have obtained the momentum integrals defining the one - loop anomalous dimension , which also coincided with the well - known expression . in prospect , these integrals can be compared with integrals giving the two - loop @xmath1-function , which are related to them due to the existence of the nsvz @xmath1-function .",
    "also we obtained that the vertices @xmath154 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 ( containing two lines of the faddeev  popov ghosts and a single line of the quantum gauge superfield ) are not renormalized in the considered approximation .",
    "possibly , this feature is valid in an arbitrary order of the perturbation theory .",
