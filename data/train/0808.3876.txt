    "although quantum gases are very dilute systems , most of their properties are governed by atomic interactions .",
    "this allows to use them , for example , as _ quantum simulators _ to study the many - body physics of systems usually encountered in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "however , in all usual quantum gases , the interactions can be described extremely well by a short range , isotropic _ contact _ potential , whose magnitude is proportional to the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath4 characterizing low energy collisions .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction taking place between particles having a permanent electric or magnetic dipole moment has radically different properties : it is long - range and anisotropic , as one readily sees on the expression @xmath5 giving the interaction energy @xmath6 between two polarized dipoles separated by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the angle between @xmath7 and the direction along which the dipoles are pointing ) .",
    "these specific properties have attracted a lot of interest recently , and a large number of theoretical predictions have been made concerning dipolar quantum gases ( see e.g. ref .   for a review ) : for instance , the stability of a dipolar bec depends crucially on the trap geometry ( see section [ sec : stab ] below ) ; in a quasi two - dimensional trap , the excitation spectrum can display a roton minimum instead of the usual bogoliubov shape ; finally , fascinating new quantum phases ( including supersolids ) are predicted to occur for dipolar bosons in an optical lattice .    in practice one",
    "always has a competition between contact and dipolar interactions ; it is therefore useful to define the following ( dimensionless ) ratio of the dipolar and contact coupling constants : @xmath9 the numerical factors are chosen in such a way that a _ homogeneous _ dipolar condensate is unstable against collapse for @xmath10 . for usual atomic magnetic moments @xmath11 ( e.g. for the alkalis ) , @xmath12 is very small ( typically a few @xmath13 ) and dipolar effects are extremely small . here",
    ", we report on experiments with @xmath0cr , which has @xmath14 due to its large magnetic moment @xmath15 , and which also allows , _ via _ feshbach tuning of the scattering length @xmath4 , to even enhance @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe briefly in section  [ sec : fr ] our experimental setup , with an emphasis on how we use a feshbach resonance in order to enhance dipolar effects and create a ` quantum ferrofluid ' .",
    "section  [ sec : stab ] is devoted to the study of the geometry dependence of the stability of a dipolar bec .",
    "finally , we describe in section  [ sec : collapse ] the dynamics following the collapse of an unstable dipolar condensate .",
    "a bec of @xmath0cr containing about 50,000 atoms was obtained in 2005 by evaporative cooling of optically trapped chromium atoms  @xcite . shortly after the achievement of condensation , a first effect of the dipole - dipole interaction could be observed in time - of flight experiments  @xcite : the dipole - dipole interaction tends to _ elongate _ the bec along the magnetization direction . however , due to the small value of @xmath14 , the dipolar interaction was , in this experiment , only a small perturbation of the contact interaction , which essentially governed the expansion dynamics .    the existence of several feshbach resonances  @xcite in @xmath0cr opens the possibility to tune the scattering length @xmath4 using an external magnetic field @xmath16 , according to @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the @xmath3-wave scattering length , @xmath19 the resonance position , and @xmath20 the resonance width . the broadest feshbach resonance in @xmath0cr is located at @xmath21  g and has a width @xmath20 of only @xmath22  g. this implies that the field control at the level of @xmath23 r.m.s . that we implemented allows us to tune @xmath4 close to 0 with a resolution of about one bohr radius .",
    "this ` knob ' allowing one to change @xmath4 allowed us to perform time of flight experiments for two different orientations of the dipoles with respect to the trap axes  @xcite , as in ref .  , but now for increasing values of @xmath12 .",
    "experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "one clearly sees the dramatic effect of an increase of @xmath12 on the expansion dynamics .",
    "in particular , for @xmath24 , the inversion of ellipticity of the condensate during time of flight ( the usual ` smoking - gun ' evidence for bec ) is inhibited by the strong dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are theoretical predictions ( without any adjustable parameters ) based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) generalized to take into account the non - local dipole - dipole interaction in the description of the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath25 of the bec : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the contact interaction coupling constant .    in this set of experiments ,",
    "the trap geometry was not very far from spherical , which limited the study of dipolar condensates to values @xmath28 . to go beyond this value and reach the purely dipolar regime @xmath29",
    ", we shall now see that one needs to tailor the confining potential , so that the attractive part of the dipole - dipole interaction does not destabilize the condensate .",
    "it is well known that a bec with attractive contact interactions is unstable against long - wavelength fluctuations ( this _ phonon instability _ leads to a collapse of the bec having @xmath30 ) . as the dipole - dipole interaction has an attractive part for dipoles in a ` head - to - tail ' configuration",
    " see equation ( [ eq : udd ] ) for @xmath31  , it is intuitively clear that in a prolate trap with the dipoles pointing along the weak direction of the trap [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2]*(a ) * ] , the net effect of the dipolar interaction is attractive .",
    "thus , in this configuration , one expects that when @xmath4 is reduced , the condensate becomes unstable , at a critical value @xmath32 which should be positive ( the small repulsive contact interaction being unable , at this point , to counteract the dipolar attraction ) .",
    "conversely , in an oblate trap with the dipoles pointing along the strong confinement direction , the critical scattering length should be negative , and a _ purely dipolar quantum gas _ can be stabilized .    in ref .",
    ", this geometry - dependent stability of a dipolar condensate was studied experimentally .",
    "a long period ( @xmath33  @xmath11 m ) optical lattice , obtained by interfering two laser beams at 1064  nm under a small angle of @xmath34 , was superimposed onto the optical dipole trap , allowing us to realize traps with cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath35-axis ( polarization direction ) and having an aspect ratio @xmath36 that could be varied over two orders of magnitude ( from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) while keeping the average trapping frequency @xmath39 constant .",
    "the experiment consists in creating a bec in a trap with a given aspect ratio @xmath40 , then ramping @xmath4 to a final value @xmath41 , and finally measuring the atom number @xmath42 in the condensate .",
    "one observes that when @xmath41 is decreased below a critical value @xmath32 , @xmath42 suddenly drops to zero .",
    "we stress that for all the traps we used , the condensate density was roughly the same .",
    "figure  [ fig2]*(b ) * shows the measured @xmath32 as a function of @xmath40 and clearly displays the expected behavior : for small @xmath40 ( prolate traps ) , @xmath32 is positive , and starts to decrease when the trap becomes more oblate . for @xmath43 ,",
    "one has @xmath44 , meaning that a purely dipolar quantum gas ( @xmath45 ) can be stabilized by an appropriate trap geometry .",
    "a simple way to go beyond the qualitative picture above and obtain an estimate for the instability threshold @xmath46 is to use a variational method .",
    "inserting a gaussian ansatz ( with the axial and radial sizes @xmath47 and @xmath48 as variational parameters ) into the gross - pitaevskii energy functional whose minimization gives the gpe ( [ eq : gpe ] ) , one obtains the following energy to minimize : @xmath49 , \\label{eq : ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "the first two terms are the kinetic and potential energies , while the third arises from contact and dipolar interactions .",
    "the function @xmath51 is monotonically decreasing from 1 to @xmath52 as a result of the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction . for a given @xmath40",
    ", one can find a ( possibly local ) minimum of @xmath53 at finite values of @xmath54 if and only if @xmath4 is larger than a critical value : this defines the stability threshold @xmath46 within this model .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2]*(b ) * is the result obtained with this simple procedure , for the experimental parameters @xmath55  hz and @xmath56 .",
    "one obtains a relatively good agreement with experimental data .",
    "a numerical solution of the gpe ( [ eq : gpe ] ) gives even better agreement with measurements  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) allows one to understand easily , in the @xmath57 limit , the behavior of @xmath46 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . indeed , in this limit",
    ", it is the sign of the interaction term which determines the stability ; therefore one has @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the length defined in such a way that @xmath62 ( for @xmath0cr , one readily calculates , with help of ( [ eq : edd ] ) , that @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is apparent on fig .",
    "[ fig2]*(b ) * that for @xmath64 , the results are already close to the @xmath57 limit ( [ eq : limits ] ) .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens if one drives the condensate into the unstable regime , e.g. by decreasing the scattering length below @xmath32 . in the case of pure contact interactions , a collapse of the condensate , followed by an explosion of a ` remnant ' bec ( _ bose - nova _ ) , has been observed in several systems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the formation of soliton trains has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the collapse dynamics of a dipolar condensate  @xcite ( in a roughly spherical trap ) by ramping down rapidly the scattering length to a final value of @xmath65 , then waiting an adjustable holding time , and performing a time of flight of 8  ms before imaging the cloud .",
    "figure  [ fig3]*(a ) * presents the evolution of the condensate when the holding time is varied .",
    "one observes that the cloud , initially elongated along the magnetization direction @xmath35 ( horizontal axis on the figure ) acquires rapidly a complicated structure with a four - fold symmetry , corresponding to a density distribution having a torus - like component close to the plane @xmath66 and two ` blobs ' close to the @xmath35-axis .",
    "interestingly , this angular symmetry of the cloud is very close to the one of a @xmath2-wave @xmath67 , i.e. precisely the symmetry of the dipole - dipole interaction ( [ eq : udd ] ) . during the same time period",
    ", the atom number in the condensate strongly decreases due to the three - body losses occurring because of the high densities transiently reached during the collapse .",
    "the group of m. ueda in tokyo performed a three dimensional numerical simulation of the gpe ( [ eq : gpe ] ) , in which all input parameters were given their experimentally measured value  @xcite .",
    "three - body losses were accounted for by adding the imaginary term @xmath68 to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : gpe ] ) , where @xmath69  m@xmath70s is the measured three - body loss coefficient . figure  [ fig3]*(b ) * represents the results of the simulation .",
    "the agreement is excellent , all the more if one keeps in mind that no adjustable parameter is introduced .",
    "let s mention that the inclusion of a small delay ( also measured independently ) in the time variation @xmath71 of the scattering length , due to eddy currents in the vacuum chamber , had to be included to achieve a quantitative agreement !",
    "the simulation also reproduces quantitatively the time dependence of the condensate atom number .",
    "a fascinating prediction of the numerical simulation is the spontaneous formation , during the collapse , of two quantized vortex rings with opposite circulation ( and charge @xmath72 ) , as a result of the strongly anisotropic collapse : the collapse in the radial directions is fast and quickly followed by an outward flow , while axially the flow is still inward , thus giving rise to the circulation .",
    "detecting experimentally the presence of vortex rings is very challenging , but might be done by using interferometric techniques ( e.g. matter wave heterodyning ) to reveal the winding of the phase of the bec wavefunction around the topological defects .",
    "the results presented in this paper are the first dramatic manifestations of dipolar effects in quantum gases , and pave the way for future studies involving even more strongly interacting dipolar systems , especially the ones that may be obtained using the permanent electric dipole moments of heteronuclear molecules in their ground state . due to the large value of such dipole moments ( on the order of one debye )",
    ", the long - range character of the dipolar interaction could then be used to achieve novel quantum phases in optical lattices  @xcite , as well as to implement promising quantum information processing schemes  @xcite .",
    "however , already in the case of the comparatively weaker magnetic dipoles , extremely interesting theoretical proposals deserve experimental study ; to mention only one example , the generation of two - dimensional solitons  @xcite ( whose stability arises from the long - range character of the dipole - dipole interaction ) is a very appealing experiment .",
