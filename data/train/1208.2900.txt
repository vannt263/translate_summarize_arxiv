    "in recent years there is growing interest in capacity characterization of distributed wireless networks . in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime , degree of freedom ( dof )",
    "provides accurate capacity approximation and offers fundamental insights into optimal interference management schemes@xcite .",
    "the dof benefits of overlapping interference space were first studied in @xcite for @xmath23 x network , where an iterative algorithm was proposed for optimizing the transmitters and receivers in conjunction with dirty paper coding and successive decoding .",
    "it was shown in @xcite with @xmath24 antennas at each node totally @xmath25 dof was achieved .",
    "afterward , the concept of _ interference alignment _ was crystalized in @xcite by jafar and shamai , where a closed - form solution for a beamforming scheme that achieves perfect interference alignment was provided .",
    "the other setting of interference alignment is @xmath26-user interference channel @xcite , which further enhances the status of interference alignment as a general principle by establishing its applications in a variety of contexts , including propagation delay , phase alignment and beamforming .",
    "the novel idea of interference alignment has challenged much of the conventional wisdom and has been then utilized in the dof characterization of various system models , such as the @xmath26-user mimo interference channel @xcite , mimo x channel@xcite , compound miso bc channel @xcite , down - link channel @xcite , etc . although the benefits generated by interference alignment are remarkable , they have so far been shown mostly under idealized assumptions such as global channel knowledge and the need of channel variation .",
    "some works have been done to deal with the former issue : @xcite try to implement interference alignment scheme with limited channel information at transmitter ; @xcite focus on the case in which the channel information is available at transmitters but has some delays , mostly due to the channel variations .",
    "it in fact leads us to the concerns of this paper  the utilization of interference alignment schemes for constant or slow fading channels . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the achievable dof of mimo x channels with constant complex channel coefficients .",
    "( @xmath27 ) is equipped with @xmath0 antennas and receiver @xmath3 ( @xmath28 ) is equipped with @xmath2 antennas , denoted by ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we first review the related works that have been done in this area .",
    "the dof of constant @xmath23 mimo x channels was first studied in @xcite , in which some linear filters are employed at the transmitters and receivers to decompose the system into either two noninterfering multiple - antenna broadcast sub - channels or two noninterfering multiple - antenna multiple - access sub - channels . then , with the use of spatial interference alignment , some surprisingly high dof was obtained . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for systems of ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath32 ) and ( @xmath32 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , the dof of @xmath33 can be achieved .",
    "afterward , _ signal level interference alignment _",
    "@xcite was proposed , in which interference alignment is achieved in signal scale and through lattice codes .",
    "the idea was then further advanced and utilized in the dof characterization of @xmath26-user interference channel @xcite and mimo x channels @xcite .",
    "in particular , a layered interference alignment scheme was proposed in @xcite which utilized the concept of both vector alignment and signal alignment , combined with a number - theoretic joint processing technique at receivers . with the same number of antennas on each node",
    ", the outer - bound dof can be achieved with real channel coefficients@xcite .",
    "the process is backed up by a recent result in the field of simultaneous diophantine approximation @xcite .",
    "recently , an effective technique called _ asymmetric signaling _ was introduced in @xcite , whose main idea is to explore the phase dimensions of communication system with asymmetric input . with the scheme proposed in @xcite",
    ", optimal dof can be achieved for a variety of single - antenna networks .    in this paper , we study the mimo x channels with constant complex channel coefficients , where each node is equipped with different number of antennas .",
    "we propose an asymmetric interference alignment and cancelation scheme without symbol extension that achieves the outer - bound or near outer - bound dof for both cases @xmath34 and @xmath22 ( @xmath4 ) . in the scenario of @xmath5 ,",
    "it is divided into three cases , which are @xmath6 ( case @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 ( case @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( case @xmath11 ) . in each case , a linear optimization problem is formulated to maximize dof . by solving the problem ,",
    "the maximum achievable dof can be determined .",
    "specifically , in case @xmath7 , the outer - bound @xmath12 is achievable ; in case @xmath9 , the achievable dof equals the outer - bound @xmath13 if @xmath14 , otherwise it is @xmath15 or @xmath16 less than the outer - bound ; in case @xmath11 , the achievable dof is equal to the outer - bound @xmath17 if @xmath18 , and it is @xmath19 or @xmath20 less than the outer - bound if @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , an intuitive explanation is given for each case to validate the results .",
    "in the scenario of @xmath22 , we show that exact symmetrical results of dof can be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] ,",
    "some main concepts incorporated in the scheme are presented . in section",
    "[ result ] , the system model and main results are introduced . in section [ iac ] , an asymmetric interference alignment and cancelation scheme",
    "is described . in section [ a],[b ] , and [ c ] ,",
    "the achievable dof of the mimo x channels for @xmath34 are investigated for case @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the dof of @xmath22 is addressed in section [ m < n ] .",
    "finally , section [ con ] concludes the paper .",
    "the dof of message @xmath35 transmitted in the system is defined as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the power constraint of the message and @xmath38 represents the rate of the codeword encoding the message @xmath35 .",
    "consider a single user point - to - point channel where the transmitted constellation @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is an integer ) is used for a single message .",
    "since it is assumed that the additive noise has unit variance and the minimum distance in the received constellation is , the same as transmitted constellation , also one , the noise can be treated as removable @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath41 is achievable for the channel .",
    "in addition , the power constraint should be no less than @xmath42 .",
    "hence , @xmath43 , and the dof associated with the message can be calculated as @xmath44    if the message ( @xmath45 ) is modulated with a two - dimensional constellation @xmath46 , the rate will become @xmath47 .",
    "since the power constraint is @xmath48 , each message will carry @xmath16 dof , i.e. , @xmath49    as we can see , if the message is a complex number and has both real and imaginary parts , the total dof is the sum dof of each part .      in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that each message has only one dimension ( real ) .",
    "given that two - dimensional constellation is much more common in practical modulation schemes ( such as qam ) , we propose a coding scheme such that the complex message ( @xmath45 ) can be transformed into a real number @xmath50 .",
    "we let @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an integer .",
    "since the sum of two structured codes is still a structured code , @xmath50 will have the constellation of @xmath53 . to guarantee each point in this constellation",
    "does not overlap with others and keep the minimum distance equal to or larger than one , @xmath52 must satisfy @xmath54 . by doing this , there would be a one - to - one mapping from the real number @xmath50 to the original message @xmath35 .",
    "for example , if the message @xmath35 is modulated with qpsk , then @xmath55 , and @xmath35 must be one of the following four points @xmath56 .",
    "if we let @xmath57 , the constellation of @xmath50 would be @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the assumption of messages being real does not lose its generality .",
    "the price we pay here is that the power constraint is no longer @xmath42 , but @xmath59 . since @xmath60 , the dof of @xmath50",
    "is calculated as @xmath61      @xmath62\\label{h }            \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in wireless communication , we normally come across symmetric complex gaussian variables such as additive noise , fading channels , and so are the input signals , whose real and imaginary parts are independent of each other .",
    "inspired by@xcite , we use asymmetric input in our scheme , in which the input signals are chosen to be complex but not symmetric . by doing so",
    ", an @xmath24-dimensional complex system can be transformed into a @xmath63-dimensional real system .",
