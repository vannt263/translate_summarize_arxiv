    "if one use the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath42 then a priori such solutions can exist .",
    "they will correspond trajectories cutting axe @xmath43 twice .",
    "one can compute the time ( we use standard notions from the theory of dynamical systems however , here , the independent variable is interpreted as a spatial one ) between two passes of this axe . denote ( after @xcite ) by @xmath44 the real function @xmath45 and let @xmath46 be the value of @xmath15 where the trajectory cut axe @xmath47 then this time equals @xmath48 it is obvious that @xmath46 changes between @xmath49 and @xmath50 that @xmath41 is an increasing function of @xmath51 tending to @xmath52 as @xmath53 one can also compute the limit @xmath54 it can be interpreted that there is exactly one nonconstant steady - state solution iff the length of the environment @xmath41 is greater than this limit @xmath55 called the kiss size . if @xmath56 then there are only constant steady - state solutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 from another point of view , if the length @xmath41 is fixed , then nonconstant time - independent solutions exist when the diffusion coefficient @xmath40 is sufficiently small .",
    "now , we study the case , when @xmath59 with @xmath60 the most interesting dimension from the biological point of view is @xmath61 @xmath62 ( the disk centered at @xmath49 with radius @xmath63 is the simplest set and we can easily look for radial solutions of ( [ ell ] ) . our analysis can be repeated in larger dimension without troubles .",
    "if we denote by @xmath43 the derivative with respect to the radial coordinate , then we get the following boundary value problem : @xmath64 for dirichlet s boundary condition @xmath65 we have for radial solutions : @xmath66 for both problems , we look at solutions of the second order ode with initial values @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 it is easy to see that for @xmath70 the right hand side of ode ( [ steady2 ] ) is positive , thus the solution increase to infinity in finite time and can not satisfy the dirichlet nor neumann conditions at @xmath71 if @xmath72 then the solution is concave near @xmath73 @xmath15 decreases but , by comparison with equation ( [ steady ] ) , slowler then in the last system .",
    "it means that , for any @xmath74 @xmath75 when @xmath76 thus , for dirichlet s boundary condition , we have the same phenomenon as in dimension @xmath50 but with larger kiss size .",
    "similarly , there is no nonconstant solutions for neumann s problem .",
    "below , we present numerical solutions for initial problems @xmath77 with several @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "for two species the situation is completely different . consider the system @xmath80 where interspecies - competition coefficients @xmath81 are positive constants , diffusion coefficients @xmath82 are positive and @xmath16 is an open bounded set in @xmath83 with smooth boundary .",

    "the dynamical system given by this ode is easily investigated : @xmath89 is its repeller , @xmath90 is an attractor if @xmath91 @xmath92 is an attractor if @xmath93 @xmath94 is global attractor ( for nonnegative solutions ) if @xmath95 more exactly , if both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are greater than @xmath50 then @xmath94 is a saddle point and its stable manifold @xmath98 is the sum of a heteroclinic trajectory from @xmath89 to @xmath94 and a trajectory from infinity to @xmath99 this manifold cuts the set @xmath100 in two sets : all trajectories starting from the set containing @xmath90 tend to @xmath101 trajectories starting from the second set tend to @xmath102 the method of monotone dynamical systems enables us to state a similar result for full parabolic system ( [ 2spec ] ) :    \\(i ) if @xmath103 then all solutions with nontrivial @xmath104 tend to @xmath94 as @xmath105    \\(ii ) if @xmath106 and @xmath91 then all solutions with nontrivial @xmath104 tend to @xmath90 as @xmath105    \\(iii ) if @xmath107 and @xmath108 then all solutions with nontrivial @xmath104 tend to @xmath92 as @xmath105    \\(iv ) if @xmath109 then the stable manifold @xmath98 is again one - dimensional , @xmath90 attracts solutions with @xmath110 @xmath111 for some @xmath112 and @xmath92 attracts solutions with @xmath113 @xmath114 for some @xmath115    the proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "the last case is the most interesting since we do not know the dynamics for any @xmath116 not comparable in the above sense with any function from @xmath117 for example , some nonconstant equilibria can exist and even they can be asymptotically stable .",
    "however , we can use the following result due to conway , hoff and smller @xcite in many cases :    let @xmath15 be a solution to @xmath118 where @xmath119 @xmath40 is a symmetric positively definite matrix , @xmath16 is an open bounded subset of @xmath120 with smooth boundary , @xmath23 is a @xmath121 function and @xmath122 assume that there exists a bounded positively invariant set @xmath123 such that @xmath124 takes values in @xmath125 denote by @xmath126 the first eigenvalue of @xmath127 with @xmath128 ( here , one can take @xmath129 and we mean the first positive eigenvalue  @xmath49 is also eigenvalue ) , by @xmath130 the lowest eigenvalue of matrix @xmath131 @xmath132 and at last @xmath133 then there are four positive constants @xmath134 @xmath135 such that @xmath136 is a spatial average of u and it satisfies @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 a is a function satisfying @xmath140 latexmath:[\\[\\label{3 }    if @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix .    in our investigations , @xmath142 if @xmath116 takes values in this set or @xmath143 is the smallest triangle with vortices @xmath144",
    "@xmath145 @xmath146 containing @xmath147 since the first set attracts all solutions , it contains all equilibria .",
    "if one has @xmath148 then @xmath149 and we the solution @xmath150 tends to this constant as @xmath151 it follows that there is no nonconstant in space steady - state solution . after easy though laborious computations one can find the constant @xmath152 we have @xmath153 , \\ ] ] @xmath154 and the maximum of the last function on the set @xmath155 equals @xmath156 ( it is reached at the origin ) .",
    "thus , we have obtained    if both diffusion constants @xmath82 are sufficiently large , namely @xmath157 where @xmath126 is the first positive eigenvalue for @xmath127 with neumann homogeneous condition , then there is no nonconstant steady - state solution . for the case",
    "@xmath158 as in the previous section , we have @xmath159 and we have no nonconstant equilibrium if @xmath160    compare this number with the kiss size from the previous section and notice that , here , a priori we have nonconstant equilibria for the neumann boundary condition .",
    "there is a numerically studied example of matano and mimura @xcite where @xmath16 is a set in the plane consisting two squares joined by a thin strip and @xmath86 such that there is a nonconstant positive equilibrium .",
    "moreover , it is asymptotically stable .",
    "if domain @xmath16 is convex all equilibria are stable ( see @xcite ) , hence it is not surprising that in this example the domain is such . on the other hand , one can understand ecological sense of the shape of the domain : in the first square the first species wins , in the other the second one ; the thin strip makes migrations between squares more difficult hence both species can coexist .",
    "most results from the theory of monotone dynamical systems one used concern systems in ordered banach spaces called sop in the monograph by h. smith @xcite .",
    "competitive parabolic systems are sop if we use order : @xmath161 the semiflow generated by ( [ 2spec ] ) preserves this order , i.e. if @xmath162 then @xmath163 for any @xmath30 it enables us to get some information on @xmath164-limit sets of our system .",
    "this choice of the order is typical for competition of two species and can be explain qualitatively by ecological arguments : if the first species dominates the second one and one increases the population of the first species and decreases of the second one then the domination conserves .",
    "for more than two species the situation is much more complicated .",
    "if @xmath165 then , roughly speaking the first species can dominate the second one , the second one can dominate the third one and this last species can dominate the first one . the simplest mathematical model of this case is given by may and leonard @xcite for ode : @xmath166 with @xmath167 @xmath168 the typical @xmath169-limit set is a limit cycle but there are three heteroclinic trajectories joining three equilibria @xmath170 @xmath171 and @xmath172 we have studied a slightly more general case in @xcite however the behavior of the system is very similar .    consider the parabolic system for three species : @xmath173 where @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176,\\ ] ] all constants in the above formulas @xmath9",
    "@xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 are positive , @xmath180    we study the system ( [ sys3 ] ) and its spatially homogeneous ode system @xmath181 in the open set @xmath182 which is obviously invariant and the same is true for its closure @xmath183 fixed points of the system ( [ ode ] ) can be easily found  four of them always lie in @xmath184 @xmath185 next four are @xmath186 @xmath187 and @xmath188 being the solution of the equation @xmath189=   \\left [ \\begin{array}{l }    1\\\\1\\\\1 \\end{array}\\right ] \\quad { \\rm where } \\quad m= \\left [ \\begin{array}{lll }    a_1 & b_1 & c_1\\\\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2\\\\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3   \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath190 what means that none of two of planes @xmath191 are parallel .",

    "thus , @xmath218 for any @xmath205 notice that @xmath101 @xmath219 @xmath220 and similarly @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 if they belong to @xmath183    the last fixed point @xmath188 can lie in @xmath216 ( and then in @xmath215 ) or outside this cone .",
    "the following theorem excludes the existence of a periodic trajectory for ( [ ode ] ) in @xmath216 if @xmath224    ( @xcite , p. 44 , prop .",

    "for @xmath246 from this half - line , @xmath247    if we combine this theorem with the result @xcite cited in the previous section and a classical result of l. markus @xcite that @xmath169-limit sets of ( [ sys3 ] ) are the same as corresponding ( [ ode ] ) , we obtain    suppose that inequalities ( [ ineq ] ) hold , four determinants @xmath239 @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 are positive , @xmath248 and all diffusion coefficients @xmath249 are sufficiently large , then for any continuous , nonnegative function @xmath250 with all coordinates nontrivial , either @xmath251 or there exists a periodic function @xmath252 such that @xmath253 and in both cases limits are uniform with respect to @xmath254 the first case takes place only if @xmath255 belongs to the half - line starting from the origin .    the condition for the diffusion coefficients",

    "it follows that @xmath251 uniformly in @xmath261 for any starting point @xmath262 as in the last theorem .",

    "it means that at least one of the species extincts .",
    "the most interesting case considered in the previous section is presented in the theorem : almost all solutions of ( [ sys3 ] ) tend to periodic functions given by the system of odes ( [ ode ] ) .",
