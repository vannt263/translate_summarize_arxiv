    "the interactions between light and matter have been studied and implemented in a wide variety of systems from cavity qed to solid - state systems for many years @xcite .",
    "one type of light - matter interactions which has attracted much attention over the past decade is the optomechanical(om ) coupling between radiation pressure and a mechanical oscillator ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in an om cavity",
    ", the electromagnetic field affects the mechanical motion of a movable mirror via radiation pressure resulting the om coupling between the cavity field and the mechanical element . because of the dependence of the cavity length on the intensity of the field , the om interaction is intrinsically nonlinear @xcite .",
    "the om coupling was first considered to trap and control the dielectric particles @xcite and then to detect the gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "however , the field of optomechanics has undergone a rapid progress during the past years and is currently subject to intensive research investigations .",
    "nowadays , the om coupling can be realized in many different configurations with a wide range of mechanical frequencies ( from @xmath0 to a few @xmath1 ) and of effective masses ( from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) @xcite .    as a few examples of om setups",
    ", we can mention to the fabry - perot cavities with a moving end mirror @xcite , suspended dielectric membranes @xcite , photonic crystal cavities @xcite and cold atoms trapped inside optical cavities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different applications have been considered for the om systems such as high precision detection and measurement of small forces , displacements and masses @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the feature that makes the om system more interesting is the fact that it is one of the most promising candidates for exploring quantum effects in the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle to observe quantum behaviour in the macroscopic scales comes from thermal noise . as a matter of fact , in order to prepare a macroscopic mechanical object in a quantum state it is necessary to cool it down to its motional ground state . in the om setups , due to the finite lifetime of the photons , the radiation pressure force is non - conservative and it can provide an extra mechanical damping under certain circumstances which leads to the cooling of the mechanical element @xcite .",
    "this cooling mechanism , which is referred to as back - action ( or self ) cooling in the literature @xcite , has been studied theoretically @xcite and it was experimentally realized in the regime of a few phonons @xcite and even close to the ground state @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the ground state cooling has been also predicted theoretically in the resolved side band regime @xcite but it has not yet been achieved experimentally .",
    "optomechanical systems have attracted considerable attention in connection with their ability to generate entangled states of macroscopic objects .",
    "the radiation pressure - induced entanglement between two mirrors of a ring cavity was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "after that , many other schemes have been proposed to generate entanglement between different subsytems in the standard om as well as hybrid om systems @xcite . aside from the generation of entanglement ,",
    "the possibility of producing nonclassical sates of both the mechanical motion and cavity field have been investigated in various om configurations @xcite .",
    "one other noticeable feature of the om systems is relevant to the phenomenon of normal mode splitting ( nms ) which stems from the strong coupling of two degenerate modes with energy exchange taking place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical nms , which has been experimentally observed @xcite , may be taken into account in those experiments that seek to demonstrate ground - state cooling of the mechanical oscillator @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there has been an increasing interest in nonlinear hybrid om cavities , where the nonlinearity is mainly contributed by the nonlinear media , such as optical kerr medium @xcite , optical parametric amplifier(opa ) @xcite , or combination of both ( kerr - down conversion nonlinearity ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the kerr nonlinearity shifts the cavity frequency and weakens the om coupling @xcite , the opa leads to strong om coupling via increasing the intensity of the cavity field @xcite , and the kerr - down conversion can lead to significant photon - phonon entanglement simultaneously with ground - state cooling of the oscillating mirror @xcite .    on the other hand , hybrid optical cavities containing an atomic bose - einstein condensate(bec )",
    "have been identified as suitable candidates for realization of the om coupling arising from the dispersive interaction of the bec with the cavity field @xcite . in such systems , the fluctuations of the atomic field ,",
    "i.e. , the bogoliubov mode , plays the role of the vibrational mode of the mechanical oscillator in an om cavity @xcite . in comparison to the standard om setups ,",
    "the om cavities assisted by bec operate in a different regime and provides a om strong coupling as well as the kerr nonlinearity in the low - photon number regime @xcite . furthermore",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that in the bogoliubov approximation the atomic collision affects the dynamics of the system by shifting the energy of the excited mode and provides an atomic parametric amplifier interaction .    despite the bosonic nature of photons , it was believed for a long time that the realization of _ photonic _ bec faces a fundamental obstacle .",
    "the problem lies in vanishing mass and chemical potential of photons which make it very difficult to cool a fixed number of photons such that they form a condensate .",
    "however , the bec phase transition was observed experimentally for the first time at room temperature for photons trapped in a dye - filled optical microcavity with two curved mirrors at a small distance in comparison to their dimensions @xcite .",
    "the cavity mirrors provide a non - vanishing mass in the paraxial approximation @xcite as well as a harmonic trapping potential for photons @xcite .",
    "in addition , photons can be thermalized via multiple absorption and re - emission by the dye molecules @xcite . in this way , the photon gas is formally equivalent to a two - dimensional trapped massive boson gas and so the photonic bec phase transition is possible .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to the laser , the condensation of photons is a thermal equilibrium phase transition .    following the first successful experimental realization ,",
    "the bec of photons , as a new state of light , has attracted much attention in recent years . besides further relevant experimental investigations @xcite , various theoretical studies have been carried out to explain the equilibration and properties of the system in the framework of statistical mechanics @xcite , non equilibrium green s function @xcite and nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "in addition , some other theoretical schemes have been proposed to achieve thermalization and bec phase transition of a photon gas in a dilute non - degenerated atomic gas @xcite , in a one - dimensional barrel optical microresonator filled with a dye solution @xcite , in an optomechanical cavity with a segmented moving mirror @xcite , and in a multimode hybrid atom - membrane optomechanical microcavity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the temperature - dependent decay rate @xcite and enhanced dynamic stark shift @xcite of an atom interacting with a bec of photons have been theoretically studied .    in spite of various works which have been done on the photonic bec ,",
    "the issue of its interaction with matter systems have received less attention .",
    "inspired by the existing studies on the interaction between atomic bec and om systems and also motivated by the similarities between photonic and atomic becs , in this paper we consider the linear om coupling of a bec of photons with the mechanical oscillator in an om cavity .",
    "we study the dynamical effects of the radiation pressure force induced by the photonic bec .",
    "the cooling of the mechanical mode and the steady - state entanglement between the mechanical mode and the bogoliubov mode of the bec are investigated .",
    "the coherence of the photonic condensate causes an effective strong coupling between the collective excitations of the condensate and the mechanical modes .",
    "in addition , the evidences of a weak photon - photon interaction in the photonic bec has been observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "actually , this interaction has significant influence on the behaviour of the om system , so it can provide a tool to extract information about the photonic bec via measuring the properties of the om system .",
    "we show that the photon - photon interaction and bec temperature can also be considered as the control parameters to achieve quantum effects .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the section [ secmodel ]",
    ", we introduce the physical model of the system under consideration . in section [ secbogo ] , by considering an almost pure condensate with weak two - body interaction , we apply the bogoliubov approximation to the hamiltonian of the system . we devote section [ secmotion ] to the derivation the equations of motion describing the system dynamics within the input - output formalism . in section [ secdis ] , we study the cooling and the displacement spectrum of the mechanical mode .",
    "section [ secinten ] is allocated to investigate the output intensity and quadrature squeezing spectra and in section [ secentan ] , the steady - state entanglement between the collective excitation mode of the photonic bec and the mechanical mode is studied .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ seccon ] .",
    "in this section we model the optomechanical interaction of an oscillating micromechanical element with a bec of photons in a microcavity which is pumped by a coherent field ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the microcavity consists of two curved mirrors with curvature @xmath4 which are fixed at distance @xmath5 from each other . when @xmath6 the longitudinal mode number can be fixed and the cavity field is equivalent to an effectively massive two - dimensional photon gas which , due to the mirrors curvature , is confined in a harmonic trap with frequency @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frequency of each cavity mode in the paraxial approximation ( i. e. , the longitudinal wave number @xmath9 to be much larger than the transverse wave number @xmath10 ) is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being , respectively , the radial and the azimuthal quantum numbers .",
    "thus , the transverse wave number is given by @xmath15 where for the sake of brevity , we have defined @xmath16 which is also the degeneracy of the cavity modes .",
    "in addition , the fixed longitudinal mode number @xmath17 determines the cut - off frequency of the cavity , @xmath18 , as well as the effective mass of photons , @xmath19",
    ". the photon gas can be in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath20 with non - zero chemical potential and so it can undergo a bec phase transition when the total number of photons in the cavity @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 the pump power ) is larger than the critical photon number @xmath23@xcite . in the experiment of photon bec generation @xcite the phase transition occurred at the critical power of @xmath24 corresponding to the critical photon number @xmath25 at room temperature ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in that experiment , the effective mass of photons and the trap frequency are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .     composed of a vibrating membrane with damping rate @xmath29 in the presence of a bec of photons . the cavity is coupled to the external environment via one of its mirrors with decay rate @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the cavity field is driven with an input coherent field.,width=288 ]    as shown schematically in figure [ fig1 ] , the mechanical element is considered to be a semi - transparent , thin dielectric membrane inside the cavity which can vibrate at eigenfrequencies @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the sound velocity and @xmath33 is the associated two - dimensional wave vector of phonons .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the grand canonical ensemble can be written as @xmath34 where all the summations are taken over two - dimensional wave vectors .",
    "the term @xmath35 is the hamiltonian of the photon gas with chemical potential @xmath36 and @xmath37(@xmath38 ) is the annihilation(creation ) operator of a photon in the mode @xmath39 . the second term in the hamiltonian @xmath35 denotes the photon - photon scattering with the interaction potential @xmath40 , which can arise from the kerr nonlinearity or thermal lensing in the cavity medium @xcite .",
    "the third term in the hamiltonian of ( [ h1b ] ) describes the cavity pumping by a coherent field with real amplitude @xmath41 and frequency @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath35 has been written in the frame rotating with pump frequency , so @xmath43 .",
    "equation ( [ h1c ] ) is the free hamiltonian of the mechanical oscillator where @xmath44(@xmath45 ) is the annihilation(creation ) operator of a phonon in the mode @xmath33 .",
    "the hamiltonian of ( [ h1d ] ) represents the interaction of the membrane motion and the cavity field , where @xmath46 is the linear om coupling constant .",
    "this part of the total hamiltonian describes the scattering of photons between the different cavity modes by the mechanical motion of the membrane . in the interaction hamiltonian , due to the large free spectral range of the cavity field",
    ", we have assumed that the membrane oscillations can not induce transitions between the modes with different longitudinal modes .    in order to have a non - vanishing chemical potential and",
    "so a bec of photons , it is necessary to have a thermalization mechanism in the micro - cavity , such as multiple absorption and reemission of photons by a dye solution @xcite or other proposed thermalization schemes @xcite .",
    "here , we have assumed that the thermalization process takes place much faster than the optomechanical coupling , which is relevant for the typical experiment data @xcite .",
    "thus , during the optomechanical interaction the photon gas remains in the thermal equilibrium , so the thermalization mechanism has not been included in the hamiltonian of the system and it is not also shown in the figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "however , we will take into account the effects of the thermalization process as a thermal reservoir for the cavity field ( see section [ secmotion ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cavity field is assumed to be coupled to an external reservoir via one of the end mirrors and we consider a vacuum input noise due to this coupling .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , depending on the type of the microcavity , other kinds of mechanical elements ( instead of the micromechanical membrane ) might be considered such as photonic crystal membranes @xcite , surface acoustic waves on a mirror @xcite , segmented @xcite , or deformable @xcite end mirror . in this paper , we analyse our results based on the experimentally feasible parameters for the case of micromechanical membrane setup , where the mechanical frequency is of the order of @xmath47 , while the single - photon om coupling is of the order of @xmath0 @xcite . also the cavity decay rate is set to be a few @xmath47 .",
    "to proceed further , we now assume that the total number of photons is far above the bec threshold , @xmath48 , so there is a macroscopic number of photons ( @xmath49 ) in the ground state of the cavity field and the chemical potential is equal to the lowest energy of the cavity field . on the other hand ,",
    "since the two - body interaction is weak in this system @xcite we can apply the bogoliubov theory to the photon gas @xcite . replacing @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) by @xmath53 and keeping only leading terms in @xmath53 in each term of the hamiltonians of equations ( [ h1b ] ) and ( [ h1d ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant and does not affect the dynamics of the system . here",
    ", the indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote only the transverse wave numbers ( @xmath10 ) , so the summations are taken over @xmath58 . in equations ( [ h2a],[h2b ] )",
    "we have neglected the dependence of om coupling on @xmath56 , which is justified in the paraxial region .",
    "equation ( [ h2a ] ) shows that in the bogoliubov approximation the photon - photon interaction takes the form of a parametric coupling between the modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 which can lead to photon squeezing .",
    "we have also assumed that the two - body interaction potential is constant @xcite and it is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the dimensionless interaction parameter whose experimental value is @xmath63 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the bogoliubov approximation leads to the linearization of the om interaction hamiltonian of equation ( [ h2b ] ) .",
    "it means that we have considered only the scattering of photons from / into the condensate phase by the om coupling and the scattering among excited modes has been neglected due to the small population of these modes .    here , the important feature is that the coherence of the photonic bec , i. e. , the macroscopic ground state population of the photon gas not only provides a strong effective linear coupling among the excited modes of the cavity and the mechanical modes , but also it causes a strong parametric interaction .",
    "the condensate photon number is given by @xmath64 but as we will see in section [ secdis ] , the changes in the value of @xmath65 induced by the om coupling and the photon - photon interaction is negligible .",
    "therefore , in the numerical calculation we use the value of @xmath65 for noninteracting photon gas , @xmath66 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the bogoliubov transformation , @xmath67 with @xmath68^{1/2}},\\nonumber \\\\ { v_k } =   - { [ \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{{{n_0}{v_0}}}{{\\hbar { \\omega _ k}}}){(1 + 2\\frac{{{n_0}{v_0}}}{{\\hbar { \\omega _ k}}})^ { - 1/2 } } - \\frac{1}{2}]^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] diagonalizes the interaction term in the hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian of the system in terms of the operators @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where the detuning is @xmath71 , with the bogoliubov dispersion relation @xmath72}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "in addition , we have introduced the effective coupling strength @xmath73 and the real effective pump amplitude @xmath74 .",
    "increasing the interaction parameter @xmath75 causes @xmath76 to decrease . besides , for fixed value of @xmath77 , increasing the temperature @xmath20 reduces @xmath65 slightly , but since @xmath78 , the effective coupling does not change by @xmath20 , considerably .    in order to more simplify the hamiltonian",
    ", we first apply the unitary transformation @xmath79 , which yields @xmath80 and so the elimination of the coherent pump term . then by introducing the symmetric and antisymmetric modes ,",
    "@xmath81 the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath82 where the constant terms have been omitted . in the hamiltonian of the equation ( [ hsaa ] )",
    "the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are completely decoupled . on the other hand , because of the similarities of the hamiltonians @xmath83 and @xmath84 most of the physical results are similar to each other for these modes .",
    "thus , in the following sections we consider only the symmetric modes and , for the sake of simplicity , we omit the index @xmath85 in the corresponding relations . in addition , it is obvious from the hamiltonian of the equations ( [ hsab],[hsac ] ) that all the modes @xmath56 are decoupled and their evolutions are independent , so we also omit the index @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , in the following the symbol @xmath86 is used instead of @xmath87 where @xmath86 is any of the operators or parameters of the system . on the other hand , by adjusting the position and the geometry of the membrane it is possible to select one of the normal modes of the membrane to interact effectively with the cavity field and the coupling of other modes can be neglected @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the numerical results are only presented for the mode given by @xmath88 , which is corresponding to the first excited mode of the cavity .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the system , we apply the input - output formalism @xcite . using the hamiltonian of equation ( [ hsab ] ) ,",
    "we can write the equations of motion as follows @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the total cavity decay rate , where @xmath91 is the cavity decay rate at the input mirror and @xmath92 is the remaining loss rate . the damping rate of the membrane is denoted by @xmath29 and the operator @xmath93 is the input noise of the symmetric bogoliubov mode .",
    "considering a vacuum input noise for the cavity field , @xmath94 and using equation ( [ bogo ] ) and ( [ sym ] ) we have @xmath95 in addition , the thermalization process is considered as coupling to a thermal reservoir with associated noise operator @xmath96 whose nonzero correlation functions are given by , @xmath97 where @xmath98 . therefore , the total noise operator for the bogoliubov mode can be defined as @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , the mechanical element is in equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath100 , so the noise operator @xmath101 satisfies @xmath102 in which @xmath103 .",
    "it should be noticed that equation ( [ motionb ] ) is valid when @xmath104 which is justified for most om systems @xcite .    defining the dimensionless quadratures @xmath105",
    "the equations of motion ( [ motiona ] ) and ( [ motionb ] ) can be written in the compact matrix form @xmath106 with @xmath107 and the corresponding noise operator vector is @xmath108 where we have defined @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "the drift matrix @xmath113 is given by @xmath114    the system is stable when the real part of all the eigenvalues of the drift matrix @xmath115 are negative .",
    "the stability condition can be checked by the routh - hurwitz criterion @xcite . for the stable system with gaussian noises",
    "all the stationary properties of the system can be extracted from the lyapunov equation @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the @xmath118 stationary covariance matrix with components @xmath119 and the corresponding diffusion matrix @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "it should be noted that the covariance matrix @xmath122 which is obtained from equation ( [ lyap ] ) is associated to the symmetric bogoliubov mode @xmath123 . using the bogoliubov transformation of equation ( [ bogo ] ) , we obtain the following covariance matrix for the symmetric cavity mode , @xmath124 in terms of the elements of @xmath122 @xmath125",
    "to study the dynamical effects of the optomechanical coupling on the mechanical oscillator in the presence of the bogoliubov modes of a photonic bec , we drive the mechanical susceptibility and the displacement spectrum of the oscillator .",
    "the symmetrized displacement spectrum of the mechanical oscillator is defined as @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 , the fourier transformation of @xmath128 , can be obtained by solving the time - domain equation of motion ( [ matrixeq ] ) in the frequency domain .",

    "the nms occurs due to the fact that when the om coupling is strong , instead of having two separate subsystems , i. e. , an optical mode with frequency @xmath141 and a mechanical mode with frequency @xmath142 , the system consists of two mixed modes .",

    "the properties of the photonic bec affects theses peaks , so the measurement of the displacement spectrum of the membrane provides information about the photonic bec . the normal modes ( [ normalmodes ] ) depends on the bec parameters in two ways .",
    "first , the effective detuning @xmath141 is a function of @xmath146 due to the bogoliubov dispersion and second , the effective om coupling @xmath147 depends on @xmath65 and @xmath75 .    in figure [ fig2 ]",

    "is weakened and consequently , the splitting of the normal modes decreases ( figure [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig2](b ) shows that by decreasing the temperature while keeping the photon - photon interaction strength fixed , the heights of the two peaks of the spectrum decrease , although their positions remain almost unchanged . actually , by decreasing the temperature the depletion of the photon bec will decrease .",
    "however , since @xmath150 this change does not shift the peaks considerably but due to the smaller population of the bogoliubov mode ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) , it diminishes the heights of the peaks .",

    "the cooling occurs because , due to the finite lifetime of the photons , the radiation pressure force is non - conservative so that in the red - detuned regime it acts as a friction force for the mechanical element and causes the back - action cooling @xcite .",
    "in addition , the back action cooling is more efficient when the light and the mechanical mode are in resonance . to quantify the cooling process the effective temperature @xmath164 associated with the mechanical mode is defined by @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "in addition in terms of the elements of the covariance matrix @xmath117 , the steady - state phonon population is given by @xmath167 which can be calculated by solving the lyapunov equation ( [ lyap ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) illustrate , respectively , the normalized effective mechanical damping and normalized effective mechanical frequency versus @xmath168 for two values of the interaction parameter @xmath62 assuming the resonance condition and keeping temperature fixed .",

    "it is obvious that at lower temperatures the thermal noise is small and the cooling process is more efficient such that for very low temperatures the ground state cooling , @xmath170 , is even possible ( figure [ fig4](a ) ) . on the other hand , by increasing the two - body interaction potential , in spite of the reduction of the effective mechanical damping rate ( figure [ fig3](a ) ) , the phonon occupation number decreases .",
