    "we note that the intensity of the bulk bands is strongly suppressed in our laser - arpes data .",
    "this is common in very low - energy photoemission and arises from the band - like character of final states leading to strongly photon energy dependent matrix elements of bulk states .",
    "we further find that all bulk states are broad compared to ss and ctss .",
    "this can be explained naturally by the surface sensitivity of photoemission causing an intrinsically poor @xmath48 resolution .",
    "for the large unit cell of mote@xmath0 , we estimate that @xmath49 , which implies a substantial broadening of states that disperse in @xmath48 .",
    "the absence of such broadening in ctss indicates that this state is highly two - dimensional consistent with its identification as surface state .",
    "ctss found in the calculations connects weyl points that both project into the bulk hole pocket at the fermi level .",
    "moreover , all the fermi pockets in mote@xmath0 have zero chern numbers . for these reasons",
    "the emergence of fermi arcs from the hole pocket is not dictated by topology , but is rather a consequence of a particular realization of the shape of ctss . in general , a topologically trivial surface state can also emerge out of the topologically trivial pocket , as is the case at hand for ss .",
    "the intricate relation of ctss to the weyl points of the system is evident from the fact that a fermi arc with very similar dispersion was also reported in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite with different in - plane weyl point positions and 16 additional off - plane weyl points  @xcite . in that case",
    "additional surface resonances or surface states hybridized with each other can appear inside or outside the nearby bulk continuum due to the presence of the off - plane weyl points . in principle , such resonances may cause the observed state to be topologically trivial in analogy to ss . on the other hand , ctss in our calculations and its analogue in refs .",
    "@xcite are both topological and we do not find surface states with similar shape that are topologically trivial in any of our calculations .",
    "the question is therefore whether the absence of a topologically trivial scenario at hand can be taken as positive proof of a weyl semimetal state in mote@xmath0 .",
    "the systematic nature of calculations carried out by us and others suggest that this is reasonable even though evidence of absence ( in this case of a topologically trivial scenario explaining ctss ) is never exhaustive .",
    "ctss is only observed clearly on one of the two inequivalent ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "this can be explained by noticing that the trivial value of the @xmath50 topological invariant  @xcite for the @xmath51 plane in the brillouin zone of mote@xmath0 is consistent with two possible arc connectivities : the one consistent with ctss , assuming that a surface state connects the projections of w1 and w2 points , and the other , in which the arcs connect the projections of w1,2 with their mirror images w3,4 .",
    "while the arpes data of the @xmath22-type surface ( fig .  [ f3](b ) ) is consistent with the latter scenario , they do not uniquely define a particular weyl point arrangement and connectivity .    to illustrate this point we show in fig .",

    "however , the large fermi arc remains present and does not even change its dispersion noticeably . artificially increasing the spin - orbit interaction , we can even simulate a state with a large fermi arc of similar dispersion and 4 weyl points in the full 3d brillouin zone . in this case",
    "the large fermi arc becomes topological , while in the other two calculations ( panels ( a , c ) ) , it is topologically trivial .",
