    "agn dominate the extragalactic high - energy @xmath0-ray sky , as revealed by the third _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray source list ( 3fgl , @xcite ) .",
    "the great majority of the sources are blazars , i.e. radio - loud agn with relativistic jets oriented at small angles to the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "their radiation is strongly doppler boosted and shows fast variability .",
    "blazars are among the brightest sources of radiation in the universe , spanning the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to @xmath0-rays .",
    "relativistic jets have been studied for half a century , but their fundamental inner workings are still not well understood , e.g. their acceleration and collimation mechanisms , or the location of the @xmath0-ray emission region .",
    "radio galaxies are believed to be the parent population of blazars , with jets oriented at larger angles @xcite .",
    "because of their misaligned orientation , their radiation is much less doppler boosted with respect to blazars .",
    "therefore , radio galaxies are typically orders of magnitude fainter than their aligned counterpart , across the whole spectrum .",
    "because of the limited sensitivity of @xmath0-ray instruments , this has particularly evident implications at high - energies . indeed , _",
    "fermi_-lat has detected less than 20 radio galaxies so far , while the 3fgl includes more than 1000 associated blazars @xcite . in spite of the small sample size and lower fluxes , which complicate radio galaxy studies at high - energies , they provide us with a view on @xmath0-rays from agn jets which is less biased by relativistic effects , and is complementary to blazar studies @xcite .",
    "the combination of @xmath0-ray data with high - resolution radio observations can be a powerful tool in investigating these questions .",
    "_ fermi_-lat has an energy - dependent angular resolution of the order of @xmath20.1 , therefore almost all agn observed in @xmath0-rays appear as point sources , and it is not possible to directly associate the high - energy emission to a specific morphological component .",
    "vlbi observations , on the other hand , are able to achieve milliarcsecond resolutions . since agn are variable sources , it is possible to identify the @xmath0-ray emission region on vlbi scales by looking for correlated variability in radio morphology or flux , and high - energy emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , multi - epoch vlbi observations provide the only direct measure of relativistic jet motion , allowing us to derive relevant jet parameters such as apparent speed and jet orientation angle .",
    "tanami ( tracking active galactic nuclei with austral milliarcsecond interferometry ) is a multi - wavelength monitoring program of agn jets south of @xmath3 declination , including almost @xmath4 sources .",
    "the sample was defined as a hybrid radio flux - limited sample combined with sources detected in @xmath0-rays or reported as likely high - energy emitters @xcite .",
    "the core of the program is vlbi monitoring at 8.4 ghz and 22.3 ghz , since 2007 .",
    "the array is based on the australian long baseline array ( lba ) , supported by associated antennas in south africa , new zealand , antarctica and chile ( a full list of the participating antennas can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "first - epoch 8.4 ghz images at milliarcsecond resolution were presented for an initial sample of 43 sources by @xcite .",
    "the sample was constantly expanded with new @xmath0-ray detections or other interesting new sources , and first - epoch images of the first - ever high - resolution observations , for most sources , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( mller et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the radio vlbi monitoring is complemented by an excellent multi - wavelength coverage , including nir , optical , uv , x - ray and @xmath0-ray data , providing a quasi - simultaneous broadband view of the sources , as is required for detailed studies of variable sources such as agn .",
    "an overview of the multi - wavelength program and selected tanami results can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the tanami sample was selected based on current or expected @xmath0-ray detections , the majority of the sources are blazars , but several well - known radio galaxies are also monitored .",
    "an example is the closest radio - loud agn , centaurus a , for which tanami data revealed the complex dynamics of the jet s inner parsec , indicating downstream jet acceleration @xcite and a spectral morphology @xcite that can be explained within the spine - sheath scenario @xcite .",
    "the tanami sample includes fifteen additional radio galaxies , including several notable sources for which tanami is able to provide the highest resolution data available : the classic fr ii pictor a , whose jet has been detected and resolved in x - rays @xcite and optical @xcite as well as radio bands @xcite ; the fr i pks  0625@xmath135 , which is the most recent addition to the elusive group of only 5 radio galaxies to be detected in the tev band by cherenkov telescopes @xcite , and shows evidence of superluminal motion in a preliminary kinematic analysis of tanami data @xcite ; the nearby fr i centaurus  b , detected in @xmath0-rays by _",
    "fermi_-lat with a notably flat spectral index @xcite ; the peculiar object pks  0521@xmath136 , showing @xmath0-ray variability and originally classified as a bl lac but later shown to have properties consistent with a larger viewing angle @xcite .",
    "the full list of tanami radio galaxies is given in table  1 .",
    "the multi - wavelength properties of these sources are currently under study within the tanami collaboration ( angioni et al . in prep . ) , including images , kinematic analysis and spectral index maps .",
    "here we present preliminary results on one @xmath0-ray bright tanami radio galaxy , pks  0521@xmath136 .",
    "this is a nearby ( @xmath5 ) agn with uncertain classification .",
    "leon et al .",
    "2016 @xcite classify it as a bl lac , and derive limits on the jet viewing angle , speed , and doppler factor using the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "their results suggest a jet viewing angle in the range 16@xmath638 .",
    "dammando et al .",
    "2015 @xcite constrain the same parameters using sed modeling including @xmath0-ray data , obtaining a more aligned jet viewing angle of 6@xmath615 .",
    "these results point to an intermediate jet viewing angle between a blazar and a steep spectrum radio quasar ( ssrq ) or radio galaxy .",
    "previous vlbi observations performed with the vlba and with the southern hemisphere vlbi experiment ( sheve ) at 4.9 ghz and 8.4 ghz provided an upper limit on the apparent speed of jet components @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the hypothesis that the jet of pks  0521@xmath136 is not strongly beamed .",
    "the authors mentioned that future more sensitive vlbi data would be able to provide more stringent constraints on the nature of this source .    the tanami 8.4 ghz full - resolution image presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ maps ] achieves an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity with respect to previous vlbi data @xcite , allowing to reveal a more extended jet36 was already presented in @xcite . ] .",
    "tanami monitoring provided 9 epochs for this source between 2007 and 2013 , an excellent data set for kinematic analysis .",
    "preliminary results from this analysis are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ maps ] , where the distance of jet components from the core is plotted as a function of time .",
    "the data shown include all tanami epochs and the previous vlbi data from @xcite , providing kinematic information across a @xmath8 years time span .",
    "a linear regression fit is applied to the components , with two of them being cross - identified between the two data sets , yielding an estimate of their apparent speed .",
    "this preliminary analysis confirms the absence of fast jet apparent motions in pks  0521@xmath136 , with the largest possible apparent speed ( for the components that can be reliably identified and fitted ) being @xmath9 for component c7 ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ maps ] ) .",
    "this , together with estimates of the jet - to - counterjet ratio , constrains the intrinsic jet speed and viewing angle to a narrower region of the parameter space with respect to previous studies , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this viewing angle estimate agrees with the estimate provided by @xcite , supporting the hypothesis that the jet of pks  0521@xmath136 is oriented at an intermediate angle to the line - of - sight ."
