    "how much an opinion against a firmly established authority can spread in a population is an important estimate of the population s adaptability  @xcite , in particular , when there exists a strong heterogeneity in the distribution of influential power regarding opinion formation . in a wide view on opinion",
    "formation processes , it has been studied to reveal the hidden mechanisms of a collective opinion formation on social networks  @xcite . there have been various opinion formation models , including the voter model  @xcite , majority rule model  @xcite , bounded confidence model  @xcite , and sznajd model  @xcite .",
    "many opinion formation models have focused on the effect of the heterogeneity in network structure for the ability to reach a global consensus  @xcite , and considered heterogeneous distributions of personal characteristics  gender , age , job , economic level , personal interests and so on  @xcite , as those two characteristics are important for opinion dynamics on networks  @xcite",
    ". however , most opinion formation models mix the concept of heterogeneity in the individual level with structural heterogeneity even though structural and individual heterogeneity can be independent to each other  @xcite .",
    "previous studies derive the personal heterogeneity in influential power from the structural heterogeneity such as the number of neighbors ( degree )  @xcite or pagerank  @xcite .",
    "there have been other attempts to highlight heterogeneity in individual attributes  @xcite , along with the authority dispersion  @xcite and asymmetric opinions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still different from overall authority dispersion .",
    "thus , we are still in the lack of understanding the transmission of opinions held by non - influential agents , grounded on the heterogeneity in both network - structural properties and influential power or authority . from this necessity , in this paper , we investigate the following questions : when a population is composed of different levels of authority of agents , how can an opinion of obedient agents with less influential power be spread to the whole population ? how do the structure and authority collectively contribute to the spreading process ?    to answer these questions , we introduce a stylized opinion formation model in a population with fixed authority scores assigned to its agents , who are connected via networks  @xcite .",
    "we assume heterogeneously distributed authority scores assigned to the agents , each of whom additionally has two characteristics : the willingness to follow the right opinion and a confidence level .",
    "the acceptance probability of right opinion is characterized by the parameter hinted by the experiment of milgram  @xcite , explaining the probability against an authoritative person s immoral opinion .",
    "an authority comparison , which agents apply on the decision process  @xcite , occurs as well . as an illustrative case , we assume a corrupt population where authoritative agents have a `` wrong '' opinion on a certain issue , to investigate the opinion spreading process smeared from the obedient agents `` right '' opinion .",
    "of course , the notion of wrong and right opinions is purely for the sake of argument and used as the binary alternatives in our mechanistic model .",
    "it is possible to understand the result as a trend of the opinion transmission from the obedient agents with a certain level of adherence in their opinion .",
    "we show the crucial role of the correlation between network structure and authority , via intrinsic social relations generated from the authority comparison process .",
    "moreover , we suggest the possibility of the existence of a specific group which is important for preserving the obedient agents opinion and eventually emanating it to the entire population in the most corrupt case characterized with the completely bipolar initial opinions .",
    "for authority , where the larger values correspond to higher authority , which are used as node indices in our description . the colors ( red versus green ) of nodes represent their opinion , where red for right ( @xmath0 ) and green for wrong ( @xmath1 ) opinions .",
    "the real numbers outside the nodes indicate the real authority scores @xmath2 .",
    "nodes compare their authority scores by eq .  .",
    "for instance , node @xmath3 chooses node @xmath4 for comparison ( the blue edge  the same process occurs at node @xmath5 choosing node @xmath6 for comparison ) , and takes node @xmath4 s opinion ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) at @xmath9 , naturally because node @xmath4 has higher authority than node @xmath3 . at @xmath10 , node @xmath11 chooses node @xmath12 , then with the acceptance probability of right opinion @xmath13 , regardless of their authority scores , node @xmath11 takes the right ( @xmath14 ) opinion of node @xmath12 ( @xmath15 ) . ]",
    "we construct a network composed of @xmath16 agents as the nodes ( thus we use the terms `` agent '' and `` node '' interchangeably in this paper ) , and the edges represent the relationship through which the authority comparison and the opinion spreading occur . for network generation , we mainly use the unweighted and undirected scale - free network ( sfn ) without self - loop and multiple edges , from the configuration model  @xcite , along with the fully connected network model to simulate the well - mixed population . in case of the configuration model , we generate the degree distribution following the power - law form @xmath17 which yields a degree sequence @xmath18 for nodes or agents @xmath19 .",
    "we control the heterogeneity of degree by adjusting the @xmath20 value , where the smaller @xmath20 results in more heterogeneous degree distributions .",
    "there is no effect of structural heterogeneity in the fully connected network obviously and it is expected to follow the mean - field approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic_derivation ] .",
    "we assume each agent as a subordinate follower who is willing to follow opinions of agents with relatively high authority .",
    "the comparison occurs in the network structure that displays the interactions via the network edges .",
    "each agent has two global intrinsic parameters representing individual characteristics : the confidence parameter @xmath21 , and the acceptance probability of right opinion @xmath13 controlling the probability to follow the neighbor with the correct opinion .    to express the heterogeneous authority",
    ", we generate random numbers extracted from a power - law distribution with the minimum value of unity , inspired by the distribution of wealth and income , which are representatives of authority .",
    "it is known to follow the pareto distribution  @xcite , the special case of power - law distribution .",
    "the set of authority scores is denoted as @xmath22 for agents @xmath23 and is going to be correlated with the agents degree in different levels .",
    "we assign the authority scores for each agent extracted also from the power - law distribution form @xmath24 , where the smaller @xmath25 results in more heterogeneous authority distributions .",
    "we focus on the two cases @xmath26 and @xmath5 , as @xmath26 is an important threshold for the consensus behavior that will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic_derivation ] .",
    "therefore , we have two sets of power - law distributed values : degrees @xmath27 characterized by the exponent @xmath20 and authority scores @xmath28 characterized by the exponent @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the authority score and the degree can be correlated or independent to each other . as representative cases ,",
    "we take three types of correlations : positive , no ( uncorrelated ) , and negative correlations . for instance",
    ", the positive correlation implies that agents with higher authority have larger amount of network resource . to adjust the correlation in practice ,",
    "we sort both @xmath22 and @xmath18 from the smallest to the largest and match the indices of the sorted @xmath28 with the sorted @xmath27 in their exact order ( i.e. , the rank - based correlations @xmath29 ) .",
    "the negative correlation is achieved by the opposite way of ordering , i.e. , matching the indices using the ascending order for @xmath22 and the descending order for @xmath18 .",
    "the uncorrelated case corresponds to the random matching .    .",
    "the decision table for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 $ ] with @xmath32 in eq .",
    "is the heaviside step function . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have shown , the connected component analysis from the relative authority highlights its importance in opinion spreading in the model . in this subsection",
    ", we observe the evolution of opinion for each authority group .",
    "to elaborate on different authority groups , we observe the average opinion @xmath33 for each authority index @xmath34 ( sorted as larger numbers represent higher authority , for natural notational convenience in this section ) as a function of time .",
    "interestingly , there are certain authority groups that `` protect '' the right opinion for a long time  see figs .  [",
    "fig : middle](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we present the result with @xmath35 to emboss the effect of different authority level",
    ". the clear behavior of the special group emerges from @xmath36 for @xmath26 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 , based on the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_opt ] consistently .",
    "the specific groups keeping the right opinion for the right consensus cases are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : middle](a ) and ( b ) . to be more specific , the agents around @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath26 and those around @xmath41 for @xmath38 play such a role of `` reservoir '' for the opinion transmission .",
    "those groups start to recover the right opinion faster , and it seems that they are primers for the transmission of the right opinion to outside .",
    "to identify the role of those groups further , we illustrate the snapshots of opinion formation for the @xmath38 case in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] .",
    "( a ) displays the initial condition of the followship structure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : internal_dynamics ] with @xmath37 .",
    "the wrong opinion quickly spreads out through the network in short time ( @xmath42)see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](b ) .",
    "however , the leftover nodes with the right opinion keep the right opinion because they have a rare chance to be invaded by the higher authority nodes with the wrong opinion , in the social structure discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : internal_dynamics ] . as keeping their opinion ,",
    "finally , the nodes with the right opinion have an opportunity to deliver their right opinion from a certain time step .",
    "once the right opinion is delivered to the high authority node as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](c ) , it diffuses through a large degree and strong influential impact , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) . for the network with strong hierarchical tendency with @xmath37 , compared to the @xmath43 case , the right opinion",
    "is rapidly transmitted to the whole network right after it is delivered to high authority nodes .    in general ,",
    "the low authority nodes are affected by the high authority nodes .",
    "however , the social structures [ such as the one in fig .  [ fig : snapshot ] for @xmath37 ( @xmath44 , @xmath38 ) ] include some `` isolated '' nodes from the main gc with the right opinion .",
    "additionally , the nodes in the specific opinion reservoir group have relatively large chance to be isolated .",
    "we check that the probability of being isolated of middle low authoritarians is higher than other authoritarian groups .",
    "only if the isolated nodes keep the right opinion , the right opinion can survive for a long time . besides , the opinion reservoir nodes can use their original undirected links , connected to both low and high authority nodes , to spread out their right opinion by @xmath13 .",
    "these results again show the importance of confidence level @xmath21 for heterogeneous authority levels .",
    "moreover , we have found that the comparison process can effectively generate zealous groups , in heterogeneous authority levels , who are willing to lead the system to the consensus .",
    "we emphasize that one has to be careful about the interpretation of the result reported in this subsection , as it is likely that the existence of such a specific group is related to our particular choice of initial opinion distribution : the wrong and right opinions are strictly divided by the authority scores . in figs .",
    "[ fig : middle](a ) and ( b ) , vertically correlated patterns seem to be smeared from the opinion dichotomy in the very beginning indeed .      finally",
    ", we remark on the effect of the initial opinion distribution in our model , as our `` corrupt population '' model might be seen as too extreme a case to draw conclusions .",
    "however , one can already see that the stability condition discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic_derivation ] is derived regardless of the initial opinion distribution , and we indeed check that randomly distributed initial opinions ( each agent s opinion is randomly chosen regardless of the authority scores ) do not change our numerical results such as the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "in fact , our original initial condition where the most authoritative agents have the wrong opinion is the harshest condition for opinion spreading from obedient agents , so our conclusion that any nonzero values of @xmath13 and @xmath21 yield the eventual takeover ( for most cases ) of the right opinion of obedient agents would hold in milder conditions , e.g. , randomly distributed initial opinions .",
    "one particular result that does depend on the initial condition indeed is the existence of the opinion reservoir group discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : internal_dynamics ] , as we discover that the randomly distributed initial opinions wipe out such authority - based specific opinion groups .",
    "we have introduced a stylized opinion formation model to understand the transmission of the low authority agents opinion by setting an independent individual attributes such as the confidence level , the acceptance probability of right opinion , authority , and structural characteristics , in a population with dichotomous opinions .",
    "we have demonstrated how the level of heterogeneity in network structure and authority , and their correlation patterns affect the transmission probability .",
    "we have confirmed the crucial role of the confidence level for the transmission even for the case of the scarce sense of the acceptance probability of the right opinion .",
    "even the slightly increased confidence level can cause the dramatic increase of the possibility in prevalence of the opinion from agents with low authority .",
    "in addition , specific authority groups can play a vital role to protect the right opinion and spread it , in the case of the most corrupt population we have examined . only if the groups , denoted as the opinion reservoir , have the right opinion from the agents with less authority , a population has a large chance for the transmission of the opinion of less authority .",
    "the opinion reservoir groups are generated by the comparison process in heterogeneous authority distribution .",
    "it gives us a hint for a generation of zealots which have studied intensively for the role of heterogeneous node characteristics  @xcite .",
    "even though our binary opinion model is highly simplified one , we believe that the conclusion from our study will hold for more general cases . if a population has a will to hear low authority agents opinion , there is a chance for the opinion to be delivered to entire population .",
    "moreover , if the confidence of each agent is higher than a certain level , the transmission could occurs through the specific opinion reservoir group .",
    "the future work may include more realistic network structures such as the networks with communities .",
    "as communities are mesoscopic units of our society , we can see how the community structure makes a change for opinion spreading in an authoritarian population .",
