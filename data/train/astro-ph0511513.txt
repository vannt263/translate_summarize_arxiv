    "a significant fraction of low - redshift qsos show strong extended emission over radii from the nucleus of a few tens of kiloparsecs or more @xcite . briefly , the main features of these extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) are that ( 1 ) they are often highly structured , with several discrete knots and/or filaments , ( 2 ) their morphologies generally do not follow that of either the qso host galaxy or the radio emission , ( 3 ) the inferred ionization parameter indicates that at least some of the emission comes from relatively dense regions ( @xmath4 a few hundred @xmath5 ) , and ( 4 ) the most luminous eelrs are associated with steep spectrum radio - loud qsos .",
    "currently , the best studied of these eelrs is that of the @xmath6 quasar 4c37.43 @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c37img ] .",
    "the origin of the gas comprising these eelrs remains uncertain .",
    "currently , there are three main scenarios :    1 .",
    "the gas is tidal debris from an interaction or merger , photoionized by uv radiation from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "2 .   the gas comes from a cooling flow .",
    "the warm gas condenses from hot ( @xmath7 k ) gas in a halo surrounding the quasar and is , again , photoionized by the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the gas has been blown out and shocked , either by a superwind from a vigorous starburst or by a wind generated by the turning on of the qso ( _ e.g. , _",
    "the gas itself may originally have been either tidal debris ( as in 1 ) or simply ambient gas associated with the host galaxy .",
    "the gas is photoionized by the uv photons from the nucleus and/or ionized locally by thermal emission from the high - speed shocks propagating through the gas @xcite .",
    "crawford , fabian , and their colleagues have insisted quite strongly that eelrs around qsos and radio galaxies must have their origins in cooling flows @xcite .",
    "they have pointed out that emission regions with the inferred densities will dissipate quite rapidly unless confined by some mechanism , and they suggest that the most reasonable confinement mechanism is a hot external medium . to support this interpretation ,",
    "they have measured the [ ] / [ ] line ratio and used photoionization models to estimate the ionization parameter and thence the pressure in the eelr . assuming pressure equilibrium with a hot external medium allows an estimate of the cooling time for the latter . in most cases , this time is found to be much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "however , there has been no _ direct _ evidence that cooling flows are important in these cases , and , in any case , the standard cooling - flow paradigm seems to have been ruled out by recent observations ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown from detailed photoionization modeling of the eelr around the quasar 4c37.43 that at least two density regimes are required , and that these can not be in pressure equilibrium with each other .",
    "this model indicates that a problem with using the [ oii]/[oiii ] line ratio to infer the ionization parameter is that most of the [ oii ] emission comes from regions with a very small ( @xmath8 ) filling factor and densities of several hundred @xmath5 , while almost all of the [ oiii ] emission comes from regions with essentially unity filling factor and densities @xmath9 times lower .",
    "the temperatures of these two regions are found to be comparable .",
    "the lower - density component could plausibly be in pressure equilibrium with a hot external medium ; the denser component can not be .",
    "the confinement mechanism for the dense regions has to be something other than hydrostatic pressure ( most likely transient shocks ) , and the pressure of any hot gas component has to be at least two orders of magnitude lower than that found by @xcite .",
    "the cooling time for such a gas is longer than a hubble time .",
    "this conclusion , of course , depends on whether the best - fitting photoionization model is roughly close to reality ; while it was selected from an extensive grid of over 200 model runs , there remain the usual worries about the uniqueness of the solution .    in order to further explore the nature of these eelrs , and , in particular , to test whether a hot gaseous halo of sufficient pressure to have a short cooling time is present , we have obtained deep imaging of three fields with the acis on board the chandra x - ray observatory . in this paper , we discuss the results of this imaging program , including as well acis imaging of one additional qso eelr field from the chandra archive . in  [ obs ] , we describe the observations and reduction procedures . in  [ analysis ] , we discuss the morphologies of the extended x - ray components , comparing them with the optical extended emission . finally , in  [ discussion ] , we attempt to place these x - ray observations in the overall context of possible models for eelrs .",
    "we assume a flat cosmological model with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "recently , four qsos having luminous eelrs have been observed with the acis onboard the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( 3 from our program no .",

    "the main purpose in doing this was to recover valid source events that were incorrectly rejected as afterglow events by the standard data processing .",
    "new level 2 event files were generated after applying the good time intervals ( gtis ) to clean the data of time intervals with high background levels .",
    "the data reduction was done with ciao 3.1 ( chandra interactive analysis of observations ) .",
    "we computed model psfs for each qso using the chanda ray tracer tool ( chart ; @xcite ) , which carries out a detailed , frequency - dependent , ray trace of the chandra optics .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of each qso , using only the grade 0 events ( which should be essentially free of pile - up concerns for the flux levels of our sources ) , and used this model spectrum as input to chart , but with the exposure times increased so that we get roughly the same number of counts as in the `` all good grade '' images .",
    "the simulated distributions of rays were then projected onto the acis - i or acis - s detector plane , as appropriate , and generated as event files using marx .    as explained in ",
    "[ analysis ] , we can not achieve reliable psf subtraction within @xmath14 radius of the qsos . beyond this radius , for two of these fields , those of mrk1014 and 4c25.40 , we detect no significant extended component at all . for the remaining two , 4c37.43 and 3c249.1 , extended emission is observed , but it does not have the character of a hot gaseous halo that would give evidence for a cooling flow . instead , the x - ray emission appears to be highly structured , and it may to some extent follow the distribution of some of the @xmath15 k gas producing the extended optical emission .",
    "the x - ray emission does not closely follow the radio structure , so this extended component is quite different from the x - ray jets often found around quasars .",
    "the remainder of this paper focuses on this extended x - ray emission .",
    "in order to detect and analyze any extended x - ray components , we need to achieve a fairly accurate subtraction of the psf . for chandra images , this psf removal is complicated by two effects : ( 1 ) the chandra psf is dependent on the x - ray energy , so it is necessary to model the psf as a weighted sum of mono - energetic psfs , and ( 2 ) regions of high x - ray flux suffer from _ pile - up _ , such that , if two x - rays fall within the sample time ( the default 3.2 s , in our case ) and within a @xmath16-pixel detection box , the event may either be rejected or interpreted as a single detection of an x - ray at a higher energy .",
    "pile - up thus results both in loss of counts and in the distortion of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "while pile - up should be relatively moderate for our sources , and completely negligible for regions beyond about a 2  radius , it could cause problems for our psf subtraction .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following procedure .",
    "we extract an image from the level 2 event file over the energy band from 0.5 to 7 kev , using only grade 0 ( single pixel ) events .",
    "these are much less subject to pile - up than are the events of other grades that are normally folded in to make the standard pipeline level-2 image .",
    "we model the spectrum of this grade-0 image as a power law combined with photoelectric absorption , and use this model spectrum as the input to chart for producing psf ray traces . using marx , we generate 100 quasi - independent realizations of the psf and average these to obtain a low - noise psf .",
    "we scale this psf to the observed level-2 image at a radius of 2 arcsec , where pileup should be negligible , yet the flux is still likely to be dominated by the qso point source .",
    "we then subtract this scaled psf from the level 2 image , ignoring the region interior to a 2  radius , as well as any residuals that clearly are due to slight mismatches between the shapes of the qso psf and the synthetic psf at radii where the profile has a steep gradient .",
    "figure [ psfsub ] shows the results of this subtraction for each of the four fields , and fig .",
    "[ radpsf ] shows the outer parts of the radial - surface - brightness profiles , compared with those of the corresponding scaled synthetic psfs .",
    "we evaluate the significance of apparent features in the difference images from photon statistics based on the counts in the observed images and the scaled psf models .",
    "we discuss the fields individually in the following sections .",
    "markarian 1014 is both the lowest redshift and the only radio - quiet qso in the sample .",
    "it shows the strongest optical extended emission of any of the radio - quiet qsos in the sample of @xcite , but this emission is still more than a factor of 10 less luminous than the strongest extended emission found in steep - spectrum radio - loud qsos .",
    "the host galaxy is clearly the result of a recent merger : it is an ultraluminous ir source ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) , and the optical image shows an enormous , broad , tidal `` arm '' , with an even larger , much lower surface brightness , counter - arm ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) .    the acis image shows no significant evidence for extended x - ray emission , either as discrete sources ( fig .",
    "[ psfsub ] ) or as a diffuse extended component ( fig .",
    "[ radpsf ] ) .",
    "the extended optical emission around 3c249.1 was first noticed spectroscopically by @xcite and imaged by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no deep imaging of the host galaxy itself in bands that are not contaminated by the extended emission .",
    "the synthetic psf is not a perfect match to the actual psf , as indicated by the large residuals to the ne and sw in the subtracted image ( fig .",

    "[ radpsf ] . beyond 14 ,",
    "however , the observed and model psf profiles are essentially identical , once again indicating the lack of a significant extended x - ray halo component .",
    "galaxy groups often show diffuse extended x - ray emission from a hot intragroup medium , indicating the existence of a common potential well sufficiently deep to retain such gas .",
    "we have pointed out in our discussions of each of our four fields that we do not see evidence for a diffuse , very extended component .",
    "we now need to quantify these statements in terms of upper limits to the presence of such gas . because of the small numbers of detected events we have to work with",
    ", we can not use constraints from the expected radial surface - brightness profile of the extended component .",
    "instead , we simply deal with counts in a defined annulus , assuming a reasonable model for the distribution of the emission .",
    "we use the annulus from 10  to 30 .",
    "a 10  inner radius is sufficient to eliminate most of the wings from the qso psf , and , at these redshifts , probably most of any diffuse x - ray emission specifically associated with the host galaxy ( although , as described below , 4c37.43 is an exception ) .",
    "the 30outer radius keeps us within a typical group core radius , even for 4c37.43 , the highest redshift object in our sample .    for definiteness , we assume a so - called @xmath30 ( modified king ) model @xcite for the surface brightness distribution :    \\(r ) = _ 0[1 + ( r / r_c)^2]^-3  +  0.5 ,    where @xmath31 is the central surface brightness and @xmath32 is the core radius .",
    "the corresponding density distribution is given by    n = n_0[1 + ( r / r_c)^2]^-3/2 .",
    "basing our choice on the two - component fits to group x - ray emission by @xcite , we assume typical parameters for the extended intragroup medium of @xmath33 kpc , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 kev .",

    "the difference between the counts in the annulus for the observation and for the synthetic image were @xmath36 ; for 4c37.43 , the counts for the observation are 2 @xmath37 above those for the psf model .",
    "these extra counts are , however , entirely due to the previously mentioned excess associated with the host . if the inner radius of the annulus is increased from 10to 14 , the excess in the annulus completely disappears .    from the counts corresponding to the @xmath38 upper limits in the annulus in each of the fields , we normalize @xmath30 models with the above parameters at the appropriate redshift . from these models ,",
    "we calculate the counts we would have expected to receive over the whole circular area out to @xmath39 . after converting to count rates",
    ", we then use webpimms to calculate the corresponding luminosity , assuming a raymond - smith model with 0.4-solar metallicity .    in order to obtain a rough upper limit to the central density or pressure , we need the cooling coefficient @xmath40 , where the volume emissivity @xmath41 . at @xmath35 kev",

    "we consider here various possible emission mechanisms for the x - rays .    1",
    ".   the most common extended x - ray features seen around quasars are x - ray jets ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these correspond closely in position and morphology to radio jets and are evidently due either to compton upconversion of microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in the jets or to x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "3c249.1 shows a radio jet on the same side as the extended x - ray emission @xcite , but it is at position angle @xmath61 , placing it _ between _ our objects @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "while no evidence for a radio jet in 4c37.43 has yet been detected @xcite , it is a classic fr2 double source , and none of the x - ray emission components lie along the radio axis . in neither case",
    "do x - ray jets provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed extended x - ray emission .",
    "2 .   some extended x - ray emission in principle might be due to electron scattering of the nuclear x - rays , as has been suggested for some of the near - nuclear soft x - ray emission from the cygnus a radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the low thompson cross - section makes electron scattering an extremely inefficient process , so it is useful to estimate the actual scattered flux in a typical example . while we do not have direct information on the electron densities in the x - ray emitting regions , they are unlikely to be greater than those in the most luminous optical eelrs",
    ". we have the required information for the extended emission region about 4  east of 4c37.43 .",
    "the total mass of the gas in this eelr is @xmath44 m@xmath62",
    "( stockton et al . 2002 ) , which gives a total number of electrons of @xmath63 , assuming fully ionized pure hydrogen .",
    "a typical distance for the x - ray sources is @xmath420 kpc from the nucleus , and we assume that the nuclear x - ray flux in their direction is the same as towards our line of sight . the calculation gives a ratio of scattered to direct nuclear flux of @xmath64 for a region of typical size .",
    "since , for 4c37.43 , we detect @xmath65 counts from the nucleus in our 42 ks of integration , we would expect @xmath66 counts due to scattering in regions like those we observe .",
    "electron scattering thus fails rather dramatically in this context , even if some of our assumptions were to be incorrect by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "3 .   in some cases",
    "@xcite , the x - ray emission can be dominated by x - ray recombination lines from the @xmath15 k photoionized gas .",
    "our calculations based on photoionization models for the strongest optical emission region associated with 4c37.43 @xcite indicate that this mechanism could potentially make a significant contribution , but also that there are many uncertainties .",
    "the fact that we do not actually detect x - ray emission from any of the most luminous optical extended emission regions in 4c37.43 , nor from any of the extended emission regions of mrk1014 or 4c25.40 argues against its importance generally in the cases we are considering .",
    "x - ray emission can be thermal emission and line emission from high - speed shocks . the cases where there _ may _ be a spatial correlation between the optical emission - line gas and the x - ray gas ( i.e. , 3c249.1@xmath18 and 4c37.43@xmath18 and @xmath20 ) are reminiscent of the classical picture of galactic superwinds .",
    "it has been shown in many edge - on starburst galaxies ( _ e.g.,_ngc253 , ngc4945 ) that the x - ray gas shows a limb - brightened filamentary structure , and lies either coincident with , or just to the inside of , h@xmath67 emission - line filaments @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism is most likely either that ( 1 ) as the high - speed hot wind and the cold ism intermingle , the dense ambient gas becomes entrained and heated in the wind fluid , resulting in both optical emission and local increases in the x - ray emissivity ; or ( 2 ) as the superwind encounters a large cloud , it produces a slow ( @xmath68 km s@xmath11 ) radiative shock into the cloud and a fast ( @xmath69 km s@xmath11 ) stand - off bow shock ; the former produces the optical emission , the latter the x - rays @xcite .",
    "similarly , in a case where the extended x - ray emission does tend to follow the extended optical emission , this correlation may be due to thermal emission from shocks within the extended emission region , produced by superwinds associated with a recent interaction- or merger - driven starburst .",
    "these shocks would also provide a natural explanation for the higher - density regions found from modeling the optical emission - line spectrum .",
    "if a galactic superwind due to a starburst is indeed the cause of the extended optical and x - ray emission around quasars , then there are at least two predictions that can be used to test the model : ( 1 ) there must be high - velocity shocks in the emission - line regions , and the thermal emission from these shocks may , in some regions , dominate the photoionization of the surrounding gas by uv radiation from the quasar nucleus ; ( 2 ) the post - starburst ages of the host galaxies must be young , _",
    "i.e. , _  on the order of tens of myr or less . the time it takes for the high - speed wind gas to travel from the nucleus to the eelrs is less than a few tens of myr , given a typical wind velocity of @xmath69 km",
    "s@xmath11 and a typical eelr distance of a few tens of kpc from the center of the host galaxy . in order to carry out the first test , two conditions must hold : ( 1 ) there must be regions where shocks are present but the gas is shielded from a direct line - of - sight to the nucleus , and ( 2 ) we must be able to distinguish the signature of ionization from shocks from that of photoionization by the quasar continuum .",
    "this latter requirement is complicated by the fact that much of the emission - line radiation from a high - velocity shock can be due to photoionization of the pre - shock gas by the thermal continuum from the shock itself .",
    "such `` autoionizing '' shock models are distinguished from nuclear photoionization models by the shape of the ionizing - photon spectrum in the vicinity of the emission - line regions .",
    "there are intrinsic differences , with the nuclear continuum following an approximate power law over many decades in frequency , in contrast to the thermal spectrum of the shock .",
    "but the nuclear emission is also likely to be subject to higher photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays due to intervening material , further increasing the relative hardness ratio of the ionizing radiation .",
    "these differences in the ionizing continuum are reflected in the ratios of certain diagnostic emission lines , and both of these forms of photoionization can be distinguished from each other and from pure shock ionization by their emission spectra @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the most useful strong lines tend to be in the ultraviolet region inaccessible from the ground for objects of modest redshift .",
    "however , with efficient spectrographs on large ground - based telescopes , it is now feasible to use weaker lines , such as [ ] @xmath70 and @xmath71 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the [ oiii ] @xmath70/[oiii ] @xmath72 vs. heii @xmath71/h@xmath30 diagram could be a very powerful diagnostic for discriminating nuclear photoionization models and high - speed shock models ( see their fig .",
    "realistic nuclear photoionization models , shock photoionization models , and pure shock - ionized models are all reasonably well separated in this diagram .",
    "we have so far been assuming that a global superwind can only be due to a starburst .",
    "however , another possibility is that the superwind could be a direct result of the turning on of the quasar itself @xcite . in this case , although the test for whether shock models can explain the line emission is still appropriate , we would nt necessarily expect to see an extremely recent starburst .",
    "whatever the origin of the high - velocity gas , the detection of discrete x - ray features associated with two of our quasar fields seems clearly to point to the presence of high - speed shocks .",
    "this picture is consistent with evidence from extended optical emission , in particular , ( 1 ) the existence of small regions of dense gas that can not be in hydrostatic pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , and ( 2 ) gas velocities that exceed those that can reasonably be attributed to gravitation . given the lack of correlation of any of these features with radio jets , some sort of galactic wind seems the most reasonable possibility .",

    "<S> we report chandra acis observations of the fields of 4 qsos showing strong extended optical emission - line regions . </S>",
    "<S> two of these show no evidence for significant extended x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two fields , those of 3c249.1 and 4c37.43 , show discrete ( but resolved ) x - ray sources at distances ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 kpc from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , 4c37.43 also may show a region of diffuse x - ray emission extending out to @xmath2 kpc and centered on the qso .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that extended emission - line regions such as these may originate in the cooling of a hot intragroup medium . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect a general extended medium in any of our fields , and the upper limits we can place on its presence indicate cooling times of at least a few @xmath3 years .    </S>",
    "<S> the discrete x - ray emission sources we detect can not be explained as the x - ray jets frequently seen associated with radio - loud quasars , nor can they be due to electron scattering of nuclear emission . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible explanation is that they result from high - speed shocks from galactic superwinds resulting either from a starburst in the qso host galaxy or from the activation of the qso itself . </S>",
    "<S> evidence from densities and velocities found from studies of the extended optical emission around qsos also supports this interpretation . </S>"
