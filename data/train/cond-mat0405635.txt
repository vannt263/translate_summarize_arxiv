    "if quantised vorticity is created in helium  ii at temperatures so small that the normal fluid fraction ( hence viscosity and friction ) is negligible , it is found that it rapidly decays@xcite .",

    "it was nore _",
    "et al._@xcite who first found that during the evolution of a vortex tangle the total kinetic energy decreases and the total sound energy increases . by doing a more detailed analysis we revealed that a short sound pulse is emitted at each vortex reconnection@xcite .",
    "the importance of vortex reconnections was highlighted when it was discovered that@xcite the vortex cusp which is created at each reconnection event relaxes and triggers large amplitude kelvin waves ( helical displacements of the vortex core ) ; these waves interact non - linearly and generate more waves of higher and higher wavenumber .",
    "this kelvin wave cascade@xcite , which is analogous to the kolmogorov cascade of classical turbulence , thus shifts the kinetic energy to wavenumbers which are large enough that a vortex line can efficiently radiate sound@xcite .",
    "recently we demonstrated@xcite the simultaneous occurrence of both processes ( reconnection pulses and sound radiation ) .",
    "unfortunately the study of quantised vorticity in helium  ii suffers from a lack of direct visualisation .",
    "better detection techniques exist for trapped weakly - interacting atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "the key ingredients of the problem ( quantised vorticity , sound waves , reconnections ) are present in both systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that a trapped bose - einstein condensate provides a model system to study sound radiation by vortices in a controlled way .",

    "in a recent paper@xcite we have suggested that sound emission by a quantised vortex can be studied in a controlled way by letting a vortex precess within a dimple embedded in a weaker harmonic potential which confines a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) atomic condensate , as illustrated in fig .",
    "if the dimple depth @xmath7 is less than the chemical potential @xmath8 the sound ( which has an energy of the order of @xmath8 ) escapes , otherwise it remains in the region near the vortex and can be reabsorbed .",

    "the vortex energy does not decay but executes small oscillations which result from the beating of the vortex precession and the modes of the trapped condensate .",
    "if @xmath19 ( shallow dimple ) , the sound radiated by the accelerating vortex leaves the dimple , the vortex energy slowly decreases , and the vortex spirals outwards to lower densities .",
    "the sound waves are emitted in the direction perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of motion in the form of a dipolar pattern .",

    "this is larger than the value obtained for the ` free ' decay arising from kelvin wave excitations @xcite , but still smaller than the experimentally obtained value for helium ii @xcite . to establish a link between single vortices driven by trap inhomogeneity and superfluid turbulence we first consider the simple example of a vortex - vortex pair .",

    "[ pair](b ) shows the acceleration of a vortex - vortex pair in a homogeneous system and a single vortex in a harmonic trap .",
    "although the acceleration is similar in both cases , the sound emission from the pair is less due to the quadrupolar character of the emission .",
    "this suggests that our value for @xmath35 is an over - estimate for the case of a vortex tangle .",
    "the acceleration of the vortex - vortex pair tails off as the vortex cores merge ( @xmath36 ) , in contrast to the analytic prediction of pismen@xcite .",
    "note that the acceleration of a vortex in a harmonic trap is strongly dependent on the trap frequency .",

    "the single vortex and its nearest neighbour in the pair have the same polarity . during this interaction ,",
    "the trajectory of the pair becomes deflected ( black lines in fig .",

    "the sharp acceleration of the vortices ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ flyby](c ) ) induces a sound burst , which propagates radially outwards .",
    "this is visible in the final density distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ flyby ] ( b ) .",
    "this energy loss results in a reduction in the size of the vortex pair , shown in fig.[flyby](d ) .",
    "the magnitude of the loss decreases as the initial position of the pair is moved further away from the single vortex , in line with the decreasing acceleration experienced by the vortices ( fig.[flyby](c ) ) .",
    "note that the magnitude of the acceleration induced by the close approach is similar to the values studied in the dimple trap .",
    "finally , if the single vortex and its nearest neighbour in the pair have opposing polarity , the interaction tends to involve a reconnection whereby these vortices form a pair , and leave behind the other vortex .    in summary , we have shown how sound emission can be controlled and quantified in experiments on dilute bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we discuss how the information gained can be mapped onto the understanding of the decay of superfluid turbulence in the limit of low temperature .",
