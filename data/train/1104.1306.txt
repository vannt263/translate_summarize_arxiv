    "the concept of inertia has been one of the most debated topics of classical physics , starting with newton s ideas of absolute space and that of inertia as an intrinsic property of matter devoid of any external influence .",
    "the notion of absolute space was criticized by leibniz and later bishop berkeley who claimed that it is metaphysical .",
    "they were followed by ernst mach @xcite who in 1872 rejected the existence of absolute space in favour of relative motion with respect to a `` fixed '' frame provided by the matter distribution in the universe , and claimed that it is the acceleration relative to this frame that determines the inertial properties of matter .",
    "this is the essence of mach s principle , a term coined by albert einstein in 1918 , which says that `` the inertial force which acts on an accelerating object is due to its interaction with all matter present in the rest of the universe '' .",
    "there are indeed several interpretations of mach s principle and arguments on whether the general relativity theory is machian or not.@xcite@xcite besides mach s principle there are other approaches towards the explanation for the orgin of inertia which describe inertia as a local instead of a global phenomenon . among these",
    "one can mention the suggestion that inertial forces result from the interaction of matter with electromagnetic fluctuations of the zero point field , @xcite ( which is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic , a property likely also related to the large scale distribution of matter in the universe and thus to the same frame envisioned by mach ) or the attribution of inertia to the interaction of a particle with its own field , namely the self - force.@xcite    the implementation of mach s principle as a quantitative law was done by d.w .",
    "sciama @xcite in 1953 , by applying the formalism of electrodynamics to gravitation .",
    "according to sciama the gravitational field of a moving particle in the universe can be expressed in terms of a `` gravoelectric '' part @xmath5 and a `` gravomagnetic '' part @xmath6 .",
    "these can be written in terms of the retarded scalar and vector potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 by @xmath9 \\mathbf{b } & = & \\mathrm{curl}\\mathbf{a } , \\end{array } \\label{sciama1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is taken to be the newtonian potential and @xmath10 ; @xmath11 being the velocity of the particle .    according to this law , the gravitational force between two masses",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 with relative acceleration @xmath14 can be expressed by @xmath15 in analogy with the lorentz force , where the acceleration dependent term is referred to as `` inertial induction '' and is the result of acceleration in fields that obey retardation .",
    "since the universe can be taken to be isotropic on the large scale , the @xmath16 term will cancel when integrating over all masses in the universe to find the resulting inertial force on an accelerating test particle of mass @xmath0 .",
    "this force is therefore given by @xcite @xmath17 where the region @xmath18 is taken by berry ( see ref .  ) to be the observable universe having density @xmath19 given by that part of the universe which is contained within the hubble sphere with radius @xmath20 , representing the distance where galaxies are receding with the speed of light . hence @xmath21 substituting values for @xmath19 and @xmath22 in the coefficient of @xmath23 in equation ( [ berry2 ] ) , berry obtained a value of @xmath24 instead of unity .",
    "he explained that this discrepancy results from the uncertainty in @xmath19 which does not include dark matter and the increase in masses of distant galaxies by the relativistic factor @xmath25 . an attempt to generalize mach s principle to curved spaces , particularly the friedmann universes , was done by r. l. signore,@xcite@xcite by using sciama s law with a potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the scale factor , instead of the above newtonian potential .",
    "moreover instead of limiting the volume of the universe to the hubble sphere , the above integration is extended to the causal sphere of the accelerating test particle represented by the particle horizon of the particle . in the case of the spatially flat einstein - de sitter model",
    "this potential takes the simple value of @xmath28 , and then ( [ sciama1 ] ) gives the result @xmath29 , in accordance with the equivalence principle . in the case of a spatially curved friedman model the calculation leads to @xmath30",
    "where @xmath31 is time dependent .",
    "this means that either the time dependent inertial mass is larger than the gravitational mass , or else , the gravitational constant @xmath32 changes with time to keep the ratio of the gravitational to inertial forces constant .",
    "however signore s work is based on two assumptions which in our opinion limit the validity of the obtained results .",
    "the first one involves the integration in ( [ signore ] ) , which as in berry s calculation ( [ berry2 ] ) , assumes that the density of the universe @xmath33 is constant over its entire history .",
    "moreover signore claimed that in a curved space the field acting on an accelerating test particle is still given by the non - covariant flat space expressions in ( [ sciama1 ] ) .    in this article",
    "we relax these two assumptions and use sciama s approach to find the inertial force on an accelerating test particle arising from the inertial induction of all matter in the universe . as done by signore",
    "we consider the particle horizon instead of the hubble sphere to mark the region of the universe that influences our local dynamics.@xcite this represents the distance to the farthest objects that can be observed at any particular time , and the redshift becomes infinite for emitters on the particle horizon . ) , because the hubble sphere expands and overtakes these photons which end up inside the hubble sphere where @xmath34 .",
    "] however unlike previous calculations by berry and signore we use a variable denisty @xmath33 when integrating over the entire universe . moreover instead of the expressions for the retarded potentials and fields in ( [ sciama1 ] ) which are valid in flat space , we use general covariant formulations valid in a curved spacetime .",
    "the inertial force on an accelerating particle for the different types of friedmann models is obtained in a form which is covariant with respect to coordinate transformations in the 3-space of these models . in section 2",
    ", we derive covariant expressions for the retarded potentials and fields for an accelerating test particle in the three cases of flat , open and closed friedmann models .",
    "then in section 3 we obtain expressions for the inertial forces and the results are summerized and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the study of electromagnetism in a general curved spacetime was done by dewitt and brehme.@xcite later hobbs@xcite obtained a formal solution for the electromagnetic potentials @xmath35 in the case of a conformally flat spacetime , and showed that in this case , the electromagnetic signals propagate only on the light cone without scattering off the riemann tensor or radiation tail as in general curved spacetimes , thereby simplifying the solutions .",

    "taking the limit @xmath80 the expression for the field in ( [ f0k ] ) with @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the components of the acceleration of the point charge at the retarded coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "this expression reduces to @xmath84 given by ( [ sciama1 ] ) in the case of flat spacetime where @xmath85 . the total force on the accelerating point charge @xmath39 from a charge distribution , can then be obtained by using ( [ force ] ) and integrating over all contributions . if the distribution is isotropic the @xmath86 term in ( [ f0kflat ] ) vanishes , and one only needs to consider the component of the force along the direction of motion , given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the charge density of the distribution and @xmath89      in this case @xmath75 and @xmath90 .",

    "these includes the inertial contribution from all matter and radiation in the universe .",
    "in this note we have tried to compute the inertial mass of particles following the approach of sciama , i.e. the analogy between electromagnetic and gravitational forces , assuming that the latter , just like the former are subject to retardation . as a result",
    ", we assumed that they yield , just like electromagnetism , a far - field force between material particles of masses @xmath124 proportional to @xmath125 ; note that because of the @xmath126 ( rather than the @xmath16 appropriate for non - accelerating particles ) force dependence , a spherically symmetric mass distribution yields a non - zero force at its center .",
    "based on this analogy we followed ref .   to compute the electric fields of accelerated charges in an arbitrary frw space time and replaced the coupling constant by @xmath127 to mimic the effects of gravitational force . finally , by integrating this force over all matter in the universe we computed the gravitational force of the latter on a body of mass @xmath0 in relative acceleration ( with the universe ! ) .",
    "this force is proportional to the acceleration @xmath14 with a coefficient that depends on the cosmological parameters , in ( philosophical ) agreement with mach s principle .    starting with the spatially flat friedman model @xmath128 , the inertial force on the accelerating particle given by ( [ k=0 ] ) in a matter dominated einstein - de sitter universe @xmath129",
    "is given by @xmath130 .",
    "although this coefficient of @xmath23 is larger than that obtained by berry , it is still far from unity , and this implies that the total force on the particle can not be explained only in terms of the inertial contribution from all the matter in the universe . in a radiation dominated universe @xmath131 @xmath132 , while if we choose the currently favored cosmological parameters @xmath133 we get @xmath134    having said this , we have to point out that the coefficient of @xmath23 in all three cases given by ( [ k=0 ] ) - ( [ k=-1 ] ) depends on the _ current _ values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "since these parameters depend on the redshift @xmath135 according to the expression @xmath136 } \\label{omegaj}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 are given in table [ ta1 ] , this coefficient will be different at different epochs in the evolution of the universe .",
    "therefore if @xmath137 , then at z = 1 @xmath138 and the inertial force is @xmath139 . this higher value of the inertial force is due to a higher percentage of matter at earlier times .",
    "for very large red - shifts the universe is radiation dominated with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and the inertial force thus calculated becomes @xmath142 .",
    "it is not obvious at this point whether such a variation can lead to observable effects or inconsistencies with observations ; we hope to be able to look at these issues in the future .    for a spatially",
    "closed @xmath143 universe the effect of positive curvature leads , as expected , to a higher value for the inertial force on the accelerating particle .",
    "so for a slightly curved universe with @xmath144 we get @xmath145 . as in the flat case",
    "the coefficient of @xmath23 is higher in the presence of radiation .",
    "so if @xmath146 , then @xmath147 . on the other hand in the spatially open @xmath148 case",
    ", the negative spatial curvature reduces the inertial force . taking @xmath149",
    ", we get @xmath150 . the previous remark about the z - dependence of our results applies also to the curved friedmann models .    to summarize , in this article we have used the formalism of electrodynamics in curved spacetime to generalized sciama s law of inertial induction to a curved spacetime represented by the friedmann models , and obtained covariant expressions for the inertial force on a accelerating particle in these models",
    "this extends previous work by berry and later by signore on the subject of inertia in friedmann universes . as in berry",
    "s case we have showed that the total inertial force @xmath151 on an accelerating particle can not be explained only in terms of inertial induction from the total matter and radiation in the current universe .",
    "we have also seen from ( [ omegaj ] ) that the inertial force is redshift dependent and increases for earlier times until it reaches the asymptotic value of @xmath152 in the matter dominated case or @xmath153 in the radiation dominated case .",
