    "the _ golden ratio _ has fascinated people of diverse interests for at least 2400 years ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in mathematics ( and the arts ) two quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 are in the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities @xmath23 to the larger quantity @xmath21 is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity @xmath21 to the smaller quantity  @xmath22 .",
    "this amounts to setting @xmath24 and solving @xmath25 which yields @xmath20 apart from being abundant in nature , and finding diverse applications ranging from architecture to music , the golden ratio has also found more recent uses in _ technical analysis _ of asset prices ( in strategies such as _ fibonacci retracement _ representing an ad - hoc method for determining _ support _ and _ resistance _ levels ) . despite its universal presence and canonical role in diverse applied areas , we are not aware of any more _ exact _ connections between the golden ratio and _ stochastic processes _ ( including any proofs of optimality in particular).=-1    one of the aims of the present paper is to disclose the appearance of the golden ratio in an optimal stopping strategy related to the radial part of three - dimensional brownian motion . more specifically , denoting the radial part by @xmath14 it is well known that @xmath14 is transient in the sense that @xmath4 as @xmath26 . after starting at some @xmath27 , the ultimate minimum of @xmath14 will therefore be attained at some time @xmath8 that is not predictable through the sequential observation of @xmath14 ( in the sense that it is only revealed at the end of time ) .",
    "the question we are addressing is to determine a ( predictable ) stopping time of @xmath14 that is as close as possible to @xmath8 .",
    "we answer this question by showing that _ the time at which the excursion of @xmath14 away from the running minimum @xmath28 and the running minimum @xmath28 itself form the golden ratio _ is as close as possible to @xmath8 in a normalized mean deviation sense .",
    "we consider this problem by embedding it into transient bessel processes of dimension @xmath29 and in this context we derive similar optimal stopping rules .",
    "we also disclose further / deeper extensions of these results to transient diffusion processes .",
    "the relevance of these questions in financial applications is motivated by the problem of optimal trading in the presence of bubbles . in this context",
    "we show that the golden ratio rule offers a rigorous optimality argument for the choice of the well - known _ golden retracement _ in technical analysis of asset prices . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that such an argument has been found / given in the literature .",
    "the problem considered in the present paper belongs to the class of optimal prediction problems ( within optimal stopping ) .",
    "similar optimal prediction problems have been studied in recent years by many authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . once the `` unknown '' future is projected to the `` known '' present , we find that the resulting optimal stopping problem takes a novel integral form that has not been studied before",
    ". the appearance of the minimum process in this context makes the problem related to optimal stopping problems for the maximum process that were initially studied and solved in important special cases of diffusion processes in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general solution to problems of this kind was derived in the form of the maximality principle in  @xcite ; see also section  13 and chapter v in  @xcite and the other references therein .",

    "the maximality principle has been extended to three - dimensional problems in the recent paper  @xcite .    although the structure of the present problem is similar to some of these problems , it turns out that none of these results is applicable in the present setting .",
    "governed by these particular features in this paper we show how the problem can be solved when ( i ) no closed - form solution for the candidate stopping boundary is available and ( ii ) the loss function takes an integral form where the integrand is a functional of both the process @xmath14 and its running minimum @xmath28 .",
    "this is done by extending the arguments associated with the maximality principle to the setting of the present problem and disclosing the general form of the solution that is valid in all particular cases .",
    "the key novel ingredient revealed in the solution is the replacement of the diagonal and its role in the maximality principle by a nonlinear curve in the two - dimensional state space of @xmath14 and @xmath28 .",

    "we also outline some remarkable connections between such problems and the practice of technical analysis .",
    "these applications and connections rest on three basic ingredients that we describe first .",
    "_ fibonnaci retracement .",
    "_ we begin by explaining a few technical terms from the field of applied finance . _",
    "technical analysis _ is a financial term used to describe methods and techniques for forecasting the direction of asset prices through the study of past market data ( primarily prices themselves plus the volume of their trade ) .",
    "_ support _ and _ resistance _ are concepts in technical analysis associated with the expectation that the movement of the asset price will tend to cease and reverse its trend of decrease / increase at certain predetermined price levels .",
    "a _ support_/_resistance level _ is a price level at which the price will tend to find support / resistance when moving down / up .",
    "this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it .",
    "one may also think of these levels as turning points of the prices .",
    "_ fibonacci retracement _ is a method of technical analysis for determining support and resistance levels .",
    "the name comes after its use of _ fibonacci numbers _",
    "@xmath379 for @xmath199 with @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "fibonacci retracement is based on the idea that after reversing the trend at a support / resistance level , the price will retrace a predictable portion of the past downward / upward move by advancing in the opposite direction until finding a new resistance / support level , after which it will return to the initial trend of moving downwards / upwards .",
    "fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart showing the asset price as a function of time and dividing the vertical distance between them by the key fibonacci ratios ranging from @xmath382 ( start of the retracement ) to @xmath383 ( end of the retracement representing a complete reversal to the original trend ) .",
    "the other key fibonacci ratios are @xmath384 ( shallow retracement ) , @xmath385 ( moderate retracement ) and @xmath386 ( golden retracement ) .",
    "they are obtained by formulas @xmath387 , @xmath388 and @xmath389 , respectively ( see the next paragraph ) .",
    "these retracement levels serve as alert points for a potential reversal at which traders may employ other methods of technical analysis to identify and confirm a reversal . despite its widespread use in technical analysis of asset prices , there appears to be no ( rigorous ) explanation of any kind as to why the fibonacci ratios should be used to this effect .",
    "we will show below that the golden ratio rule derived in the previous section offers a rigorous optimality argument for the choice of the golden retracement ( @xmath386 ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that such an argument has been found / given in the literature .",
    "golden ratio and fibonacci numbers .",
    "_ the link between the two is well known and is expressed by binet s formula @xmath390 where @xmath391 and @xmath392 .",
    "it follows that @xmath393 this fact is used in the description of fibonacci retracement above .",
    "\\3 . _ the cev model .",
    "_ one of the simplest / tractable models for asset price movements that is capable of reproducing the implied volatility smile / frown effect and the ( inverse ) leverage effect ( both observed in the empirical data ) is the _ constant elasticity of variance _ ( cev ) model in which the ( nonnegative ) asset price process @xmath394 solves @xmath395 where @xmath396 is the appreciation rate , @xmath2 is the volatility coefficient , and @xmath397 is the elasticity parameter . if @xmath398 then @xmath399 is a geometric brownian motion which was initially considered in  @xcite and  @xcite . for @xmath400 this model",
    "was firstly considered in  @xcite for @xmath401 and then in  @xcite for @xmath402 . due to its predictive power and tractability ,",
    "the cev model is widely used by practitioners in the financial industry , especially for modeling prices of equities and commodities .",
    "if @xmath401 then the model embodies the _ leverage effect _ ( commonly observed in equity markets ) where the volatility of the asset price increases as its price decreases . if @xmath402 then the model embodies the _ inverse leverage effect _",
    "( often observed in commodity markets ) where the volatility of the asset price increases when its price increases .",
    "for example , it is reported in  @xcite that the elasticity coefficient @xmath403 for gold on the london bullion market in the period from 2000 to 2007 was approximately 0.49 .",
    "similar elasticity coefficients have also been observed for other precious metals ( such as copper for instance ) .    in the remainder of this section we focus on the case",
    "when @xmath95 and .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath399 solving ( [ 53 ] ) is a strict local martingale ( a local martingale which is not a true martingale ) in this case due to the fact that @xmath404 is strictly decreasing on @xmath405 for any @xmath406 .",
    "this also implies that @xmath399 does not admit an equivalent martingale measure so that the cev model may admit arbitrage opportunities .",
    "one way of looking at the models of this type is to associate them with asset price bubbles ( see  @xcite ) . after soaring to a finite ultimate maximum ( bubble ) at a finite time",
    ", the asset price will tend to zero as time goes to infinity , and the central question for a holder of the asset becomes when to sell so as to be as close as possible to the time at which the ultimate maximum is attained .",
    "more precisely , introducing the running maximum process @xmath407 associated with @xmath399 by setting @xmath408 and recalling that @xmath409 as @xmath58 , we see that the ultimate supremum @xmath410 is attained at some random time @xmath8 in the sense that @xmath411 with @xmath412-probability one for @xmath406 given and fixed .",
    "the optimal selling problem addressed above then becomes the optimal prediction problem @xmath413 where the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath13 of @xmath399 ( with finite mean ) and @xmath406 is given and fixed .",
    "we will now show that due to the well - known connection between cev and bessel processes ( dating back to similar transformations in  @xcite and @xcite ) the problem ( [ 56 ] ) can be reduced to the problem ( [ 214 ] ) solved above .",
    "\\4 . _ the golden ratio rule for the cev process .",
    "_ for @xmath29 given and fixed consider the @xmath39-dimensional bessel process @xmath14 solving ( [ 26 ] ) under @xmath33 with @xmath27 . recall that the scale function @xmath3 is given by ( [ 27 ] ) and set @xmath414 for @xmath27 with @xmath415 given and fixed .",
    "then the process @xmath416 defined by @xmath417 is on natural scale and it s formula shows that @xmath399 solves @xmath418 where @xmath419 and @xmath420 is a standard brownian motion . note that equation ( [ 58 ] ) coincides with equation ( [ 53 ] ) for @xmath95 and @xmath421 . by the uniqueness in law for this equation ( among positive solutions )",
    "it follows that @xmath416 is a cev process . from the properties of",
    "@xmath14 it follows that after starting at @xmath422 , the process @xmath399 stays strictly positive ( without exploding at a finite time ) and @xmath409 with @xmath412-probability one as @xmath58 .",
    "this shows that @xmath8 in ( [ 55 ] ) is well defined .",
    "moreover , due to the reciprocal relationship ( [ 57 ] ) we see that the time of the ultimate maximum @xmath8 for @xmath399 in ( [ 55 ] ) coincides with the time of the ultimate minimum @xmath8 for @xmath14 in ( [ 210 ] ) , and hence the problem ( [ 56 ] ) has the same solution as the problem ( [ 214 ] ) ( note also that the natural filtrations of @xmath399 and @xmath14 coincide so that @xmath13 is a stopping time of @xmath399 if and only if @xmath13 is a stopping time of @xmath14 ) . since @xmath423 if and only if @xmath424 it follows from ( [ 41 ] ) in theorem  [ theor4 ] that the optimal stopping time in ( [ 56 ] ) is given by @xmath425 where @xmath286 is the unique solution to either ( [ 42 ] ) or ( [ 43 ] ) belonging to @xmath288 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath336 then we know from ( [ 411 ] ) that @xmath426 so that ( [ 59 ] ) reads @xmath427 this is the _ golden ratio rule _ for the cev process @xmath428 where @xmath14 is the radial part of three - dimensional brownian motion ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .      to relate the golden ratio rule ( [ 510 ] ) to fibonacci retracement discussed above , let @xmath429 denote the larger quantity and let @xmath430 denote the smaller quantity in the golden ratio rule . to determine the percentage of @xmath21 in @xmath23 we need to calculate @xmath431\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\frac{\\varphi}{1 + \\varphi } = \\frac{1}{\\varphi}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] multiplying this expression by @xmath432 gives @xmath386 and this is exactly the _ golden retracement _ discussed above . in view of the optimality of ( [ 510 ] ) in ( [ 56 ] ) we see that the golden retracement of @xmath433 for the cev process @xmath428 ( starting close to zero ) where @xmath14 is the radial part of three - dimensional brownian motion can be seen as a rational support level ( in the sense that rational investors who aim at selling the asset at the time of the ultimate maximum will sell the asset at the time of the golden retracement , and therefore the asset price could be expected to raise afterwards ) . to our knowledge",
