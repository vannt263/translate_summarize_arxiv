    "recent surveys such as sdss , cfhqs and ukidss have unveiled about 50 quasars at redshifts @xmath0 , when the universe is less than 1 gyr old @xcite .",
    "the most distant quasar discovered to date , ulas j1120 + 0641 , has a redshift of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 after the big bang ) , with a mass @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is still a mystery how these supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) accumulated so much mass in such a short time ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is that they grew from bhs left behind by the first generation of stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter th09 ) .",
    "these ` population iii ' ( popiii ) stars are thought to have formed from molecular - cooling gas collapsing inside dark matter ( dm ) minihaloes at redshifts @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "popiii stars are thought to be massive ( @xmath11 , @xcite , @xcite ; but see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , metal - free , and short - lived ; after their deaths , they would have left behind bhs with @xmath12 per cent of their original mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these ` seed ' bhs can then grow by accreting gas and merging with their peers through hierarchical structure formation .",
    "provided that they can accrete efficiently ( but see @xcite , @xcite ) popiii seeds can grow to @xmath13 by @xmath14 without a super - eddington phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tph12 ) .",
    "one of the main uncertainties of the above scenario of smbh formation is when and where the first stars form .",
    "recent studies of the effect of baryonic streaming motions ( bsms ) have put new insights into this question ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . before cosmic recombination",
    ", the excitation of acoustic oscillations in photon - baryon fluids generates relative bulk velocities between the gas and the dm . during recombination ,",
    "the sound speed of baryons drops abruptly , so that the mean relative motion of @xmath15 becomes supersonic .",
    "this bulk motion makes it easier for gas to stream out of dm haloes and thus affects the distribution and evolution of baryons in the early universe @xcite .",
    "in particular , the streaming velocities suppress the formation of popiii stars @xcite . the effect is larger at higher redshifts , when the characteristic dm halo potentials are shallower and the bulk streaming velocities are larger compared to the sound speed of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    the earliest - forming popiii seeds , which are the most vulnerable to bsms , are also believed to be the most important ` building blocks ' in the assembly of the first smbhs in the pop - iii scenario .",
    "this is because of the gravitational recoil effect , in which the asymmetric emission of gravitational waves imparts velocities as large as thousands of @xmath16 to the merged object , relative to the rest frame of the binary s centre of mass ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mergers of bhs of similar masses result in higher recoil velocities , and are thus more likely to result in ejection from the host halo ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "inversely , a seed that has formed with a greater mass than the rest of the population will suffer smaller recoils following a merger and is less likely to be ejected ; a seed that forms earlier than the rest may be doubly protected , because it will have had more time to grow before its first merger and also benefit from residing in a deeper host potential well .",
    "the survival bias for the most massive bhs ( ` survival of the fittest ' ; @xcite ; cf . ) increases in a runaway fashion as the objects that survive mergers become increasingly more massive with respect to their contemporaries .",
    "bsms could thus affect the assembly of smbhs via mergers by preferentially suppressing the number density of the earliest seed bhs .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate how this reduction of the number of seed bhs affects smbh formation in the early universe .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the following two questions : ( 1 ) whether the formation of @xmath17 smbhs at @xmath18 is still possible without super - eddington accretion ; and ( 2 ) how the bsms influence the bh mass function in the redshift range @xmath19 , which could be probed by the _ _ james webb space telescope _ _ ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in ",
    "[ s : methods ] , we describe our semianalytic model : the construction of merger trees based on a new algorithm , the implementation of the bsm effect , prescriptions for bh formation and growth , and the subsequent heating of the igm .",
    "we present and discuss our results in ",
    "[ s : results ] , and conclude in ",
    "[ s : concl ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath20 cold dark matter ( @xmath20cdm ) cosmology with parameters from seven - year results of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ _ wmap__7 ; @xcite ) : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the _ wmap _ nine - year results @xcite as well as the _ planck _ results @xcite within the @xmath27-@xmath28 uncertainties .",
    "the variance of density fluctuations is calculated by using fitting formulae for the dm power spectrum ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the growth function ( from * ? ? ?",
    "following previous works ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ) , we employ semianalytic monte carlo merger trees to simulate the hierarchical assembly of dm haloes and the growth of their nuclear bhs .",
    "an important aspect of the present work is the adoption of the ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite of dm in the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism .",
    "previous studies that utilized merger trees have used the spherical collapse model @xcite , which is known to underpredict the number of the most massive haloes when compared to @xmath29-body simulations , with the discrepancy increasing with look - back time .    however , until recently it was not practically feasible to generate merger trees based on the ellipsoidal eps model , because the fitting formula for the conditional mass function was inaccurate for small time steps @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite derived an accurate form of the conditional mass function for @xmath31thus enabling the construction of ellipsoidal merger trees  and developed several algorithms that faithfully reproduce the progenitor mass function .",
    "we adopt their ` method b ' , which in a follow - up paper ( zhang et al . in preparation ) is found to agree best with @xmath29-body simulations .",
    "we do not detail the mathematical formulae and algorithms here , and instead refer the reader to the above papers for a comprehensive description .",
    "we have confirmed the fidelity of our merger trees by comparing the progenitor mass function with the semianalytic predictions of the ellipsoidal eps model .",
    "for example , in 100 realizations of the assembly history of a @xmath32 parent halo at @xmath33 , the mean monte carlo progenitor mass function agrees with the theoretical expectation to within a few percent out to @xmath34 .",
    "the discrepancy becomes somewhat larger for higher redshift when there are fewer progenitors , e.g. within @xmath35 per cent for @xmath36 .",
    "we note that compared to the spherical - collapse model , the ellipsoidal model predicts at @xmath37 a factor @xmath38 more haloes with @xmath39 .",
    "thus , employing the latter model is essential in accurately characterizing the population of the very first seed bhs .",
    "we simulate the assembly history of @xmath40 haloes whose masses @xmath41 at @xmath33 exceed @xmath42 ; these haloes represent a comoving volume of @xmath43 .",
    "because it is intractable to directly simulate all of the haloes below @xmath42 in such a large volume , we instead construct a statistical representation of these lower - mass haloes by simulating narrow mass bins  with logarithmic widths of @xmath44 ranging from @xmath45-@xmath46each represented by a sample of 100 haloes , and then scaling up the counting results for each bin to the expected halo abundances ( see section 2.6 and table 1 in for details ) .",
    "in other words , our simulations combine a statistical approximation of the assembly of haloes with @xmath47 , alongside a direct realization of those with @xmath48 .",
    "bsms suppress the formation of the first stars by inhibiting the collapse of gas into early dm minihaloes .",
    "several numerical studies have shown that in the absence of bsms , popiii stars typically form in haloes with virial temperatures @xmath49 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or , equivalently , circular velocities @xmath50 . streaming velocities effectively raise this threshold for popiii formation ;",

    "the case @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 .    because bsms are coherent on scales of a few comoving mpc @xcite and the dm haloes in our simulation satisfy @xmath56 , we associate each @xmath33 parent halo and all of its progenitors with a single streaming velocity value at recombination , @xmath57 , drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with an rms value @xmath58 .",
    "the streaming velocity subsequently decays with time as @xmath59 .",
    "we convert the circular velocity threshold in equation to a mass threshold @xmath60 through the relation @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the virial radius ; @xmath63 we seed a halo with the bh remnant of a popiii star if its mass is higher than both @xmath64 and the cosmological jeans mass ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the jeans length , @xmath67 is the mean matter density and @xmath68 is the gas sound speed in the igm .",

    "the masses of the remnant seed bhs are prescribed using a semianalytic fit ( ) to the simulation results of @xcite .",
    "for the high - mass stars ( @xmath84 ) of the greatest interest , the remnant bh mass is @xmath85 per cent of the stellar mass ; we assume that stars in the pair - instability mass window @xmath86 leave behind no bh remnant @xcite .",

    "a halo is not seeded if it or any of its progenitors have previously formed a seed bh .",

    "a random gravitational recoil velocity is assigned to the merged bh according to the fitting formula of @xcite , under the assumption that components of bh spin are uniformly distributed : @xmath88 for the dimensionless spin magnitude , and @xmath89 for spin vector angles with respect to the inspiral plane ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the recoiling bh is discarded if the recoil velocity is so great that the bh can not resettle at the halo centre via damping by dynamical friction within a hubble time ( see for details ) .    _ bh growth and igm heating .",

    "we refer the reader to to ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the relevant details of cosmological radiative transfer .    as the igm is heated , its jeans mass scale increases , so that gas in low - mass haloes can no longer collapse .",
    "we implement this negative feedback by assuming that the bhs can only form and grow if their host halo exceeds the jeans mass , and that they can only grow for @xmath101 [ comparable to the typical active galactic nucleus ( agn ) lifetime ; e.g. @xcite ] following the most recent merger of their host with another halo exceeding @xmath79 . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray heating of the igm by miniquasars is a self - regulatory feedback , in that the emission of the accreting bhs act to suppress the subsequent formation and growth of bhs in low - mass haloes . in models without this self - regulatory feedback ,",
    "miniquasars heat the igm but the igm temperature has no bearing on bh formation and growth ; seed bhs form in pristine haloes above the cooling mass and are allowed to grow continuously at @xmath90 of the eddington rate .",
    "because the gas accreted by the bhs following each merger episode is much less than the fraction of cool gas in the merged halo , we assume that bsms do not affect bh growth in our simulations beyond raising the halo mass threshold above which mergers can trigger accretion .",
    "we discuss caveats to this assumption in ",
    "[ s : concl ] .",
    "bsms and the negative feedback from igm heating have the same qualitative effect of reducing the number of bh seeds , but they operate preferentially at different epochs .",
    "the former has a greater impact at early times when the relative speeds between baryons and dm are greater , and the latter operates at later times after the x - rays from the earliest growing bhs have sufficiently raised the cosmological jeans mass . to isolate these two effects",
    ", we run four sets of simulations , toggling each effect on and off .",
    "we use the same dm haloes and merger histories for each set of simulations .",
    "the models without regulation by igm heating vastly overproduce massive bhs compared to the observational constraints ; these are shown merely to illustrate , in the simplest model of a steadily exponentially growing bhs , how the late - time bh population is affected when seed bh production is delayed by bsms .",
    "we plot the mass evolution of the nuclear bh population in fig .",
    "[ f : rhobhall ] . in all simulations , x - rays from miniquasars ` globally warm ' the igm .",
    "the panels on the left - hand side show results from simulations where the rising igm temperature provides no feedback on the bhs , whereas the panels on the right - hand side show results where the warming provides a negative feedback on the formation and growth of nuclear bhs , as described in the previous section .",
    "the results from simulations implementing bsms are shown in thick lines , and those from simulations without bsms are shown in thin lines with lighter colours .",
    "the solid curves in the upper panels show the global bh density @xmath102 for all nuclear bhs as a function of redshift ; the dashed curves show the density for only the bhs exceeding @xmath97 .",
    "the lower panels show the rate of change in the universal bh density @xmath103 ( solid black or grey curves ) , along with contributions from new seed formation ( dotted green ) and gas accretion ( dashed blue ) , as well as losses due to gravitational recoil ( long - dashed red ) .",
    "the losses due to bhs being ` stuck ' in unmerged satellite haloes are not shown .",
    "for the simulations with the ` global warming ' feedback , the @xmath103 curves become very crowded near where the igm heating begins to suppress seed bh formation and accretion .",
    "we have included a zoom - in view of this region of the plot ( magenta boxes , lower right - hand panel ) for ease of viewing .",
    "as anticipated , the primary effect of bsms is to suppress the formation of seed bhs ( popiii stars ) at early times .",
    "the increase in the effective jeans mass delays seed bh formation by @xmath104 at @xmath105 @xcite in simulations both with and without self - regulation .",
    "a somewhat counterintuitive result is that the suppression of @xmath102 by bsms ( relative to the control simulations with bsms turned off ) decreases with time , even in the simple ` no self - regulation ' models in which all bhs grow steadily at @xmath90 of the eddington rate . by @xmath106 ,",
    "the total smbh mass density and its growth rate in the cases with and without bsms are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "this is because the ` extra ' seeds that form in the absence of bsms do not contribute efficiently to @xmath102 .",
    "many become satellites as their host haloes become tidally stripped during a minor merger , and those that do merge with other bhs are often ejected from the host halo by the gravitational recoil effect .",
    "the vulnerability of the earliest seed bhs to the recoil effect was pointed out by @xcite ; and had also shown that the number and masses of massive bhs in merger - tree simulations depended weakly on the number of seed bhs formed . in other words , simply doubling ( or halving ) the number of seed bhs does not double ( or halve ) the total mass of nuclear bhs at later times .",
    "the bh mass densities in simulations with and without bsms converge earlier and more strongly in the presence of the global warming , self - regulating feedback by miniquasars .",
    "to illustrate why this occurs , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : igm ] the temperature history of the igm , @xmath107 ( top panels ) in our simulations , along with the mass scales that govern seed formation and accretion , @xmath64 and @xmath79 ( bottom panels ) . as with the previous figure ,",
    "thick black curves show results from the simulations with bsms , and thin grey curves show those without bsms .",
    "we show the distribution of the cooling mass @xmath64 in blue . the case with no bsms is highlighted in light blue , the region between zero streaming velocity and the @xmath108 upper bound is shaded in blue , and the mean value of @xmath64 is shown a solid blue curve . as with fig .",
    "[ f : rhobhall ] , we have zoomed in on the region of the figure where the igm heating feedback begins to affect bh formation and accretion ( bottom panels ) .    when @xmath79 exceeds @xmath64 , the formation of new bhs is rapidly suppressed .",
    "in addition , because the host haloes must exceed the jeans mass and have recently merged with another such halo for bhs to continue growing , the jeans mass threshold also acts as a thermostat for bh accretion . in the simulations without bsms ,",
    "the igm heats slightly faster than in the case with bsms , because there are more bhs to photoheat the igm .",
    "however , this also means that the jeans mass rises faster , and the negative feedback becomes effective earlier .",
    "once the cosmological jeans mass exceeds the cooling mass threshold , bh growth becomes strongly coupled to the igm temperature , and bsms effectively become irrelevant for bh growth and formation , at least in the context of the models considered here .",
    "this occurs at @xmath109 without bsms , and @xmath110 with bsms , but at @xmath111 the igm temperature ( and reionization ) histories are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "let us now focus on how bsms affect the population of the most massive smbhs at @xmath112 .",
    "we consider the total mass @xmath113 contained in the progenitor haloes that eventually assemble a single massive halo at @xmath33 ( i.e. the total mass of bhs inside a given merger tree ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : bigbhs ] , we plot the distribution of this quantity for the 70 most massive haloes ( @xmath114 ) at @xmath33 .",
    "that is , we take the 70 sets of progenitors ( with each set associated with its own streaming velocity value ) that eventually assembly our 70 most massive haloes at @xmath112 , compute @xmath115 for each set , and summarize the distribution . here",
    ", @xmath115 denotes the total bh mass per parent halo , not the total bh mass in the @xmath116 comoving volume of our simulations . as with the earlier figures ,",
    "the darker ( lighter ) shades show the cases with ( without ) bsms , while the left - hand ( right - hand ) panels show the cases without ( with ) self - regulation due to igm heating .",
    "the purple lines in each panel show the mean values per progenitor set , and these are enveloped by shaded regions that denote the @xmath117 distribution bounds .",
    "the top panels show the total accumulated @xmath113 per parent halo , and the panels below show the distribution of cumulative bh masses created as new seeds ( @xmath117 bounds shaded in green ) , accreted ( blue ) and ejected via recoil ( red ) .",
    "because the masses of the parent haloes at @xmath33 differ by less than a factor of 3 , we have opted not to weigh @xmath113 by the parent halo mass .",
    "note that negative feedback from igm heating does not strongly affect the total seed mass created in these haloes ( green curves ) .",
    "this is because most of the seeds are formed before the rise in @xmath73 and @xmath79 turns off seed production .",
    "as pointed out by , these early - forming bhs cause the ` global warming ' but are largely unaffected by it .",
    "the distribution of @xmath113 has a much narrower spread in the models without streaming velocities .",
    "note that the thin curves are enveloped by narrow shaded bands denoting the @xmath117 bounds , whereas the shaded bands around the thick curves are wider ( in some cases , the @xmath118 scatter is larger than the mean , resulting in the shaded regions extending to zero ) . because each of the 70 haloes have millions of seed - forming progenitors , the total bh formation rate averages out to uniform values in each of these haloes .",
    "the subsequent growth of the bhs is uniform in the models without self - regulation , and determined by @xmath107 ( which is a global quantity ) and the halo merger history ( which averages out over large numbers ) in the models with self - regulating feedback . in the models with bsms , there is a larger scatter in the seed formation rates at early times due to statistical variations in @xmath64 from halo to halo , which then propagates to the subsequent accreted and ejected masses .",
    "however , at late times , the statistical fluctuations decrease as ( i ) the spread in @xmath64 decays with the streaming velocities , and ( ii ) in the models with self - regulation , the jeans mass overtakes @xmath64 as the relevant mass scale once the igm is heated to @xmath119 .",
    "we see no evidence in our simulations that the bsms impede the ` survival of the fittest ' mode of merger - driven growth ( @xcite ; ) discussed in  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "naively , one might expect that suppressing the earliest seed bhs ( which would get a head start in growth ) would increase the number of ejected bhs ( because mergers between bhs of similar masses result in larger recoil velocities ) .",
    "the number of bh mergers is slightly reduced in the simulations with bsms ( see also  [ subsec : mergers ] and fig.[f : gw ] ) , but the fraction of mergers that result in ejection are not appreciably greater .    fig . [ f : bigbhs ] reemphasises the qualitative findings discussed earlier : bsms can reduce the number of bhs at early times , but this relative suppression is smeared out at late times because ( i ) total bh masses have a sublinear dependence on the total number of seeds formed , since many seeds are lost as satellites or via gravitational recoil , and ( ii ) negative feedback due to igm heating further tends to suppress the differences at earlier times by acting as a thermostat for bh formation and growth .",
    "the figure also confirms that while bsms can be a powerful suppressant at early times in places where the streaming velocities happen to be large , the mean effect at late times and across large volumes is much more moderate .",
    "our results so far indicate that bsms are unlikely to have an appreciable effect on the smbh population at @xmath121 , at least in the models we have considered .",
    "what about higher redshifts ?",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f : qlf ] the quasar luminosity function predicted by the models with self - regulating global warming feedback , at @xmath33 , 9 , 10 and 11 .",
    "these are shown as shaded regions , to account for the poisson errors of our simulated sample and the ambiguity of the duty cycle in our model ( i.e. whether our eddington ratio of @xmath90 for accreting bhs means that the bhs are shining all the time at @xmath122 , or only @xmath90 of the time at @xmath123 ) . as with previous figures ,",

    "coincidentally , this is comparable to the largest distance at which _ jwst _ could detect growing bhs .",
    "it is plausible that models that predict the quasar population at such high redshifts can overpredict their abundance if they do not take bsms into account .",

    ", our results suggest that bsms will not appreciably affect the observability of nuclear bhs in the early universe .",
    "we have investigated the possible consequences of the early suppression of the formation of seed bhs by the relative bulk motion of baryons against dm haloes in the early universe .",
    "we investigated how bsms can affect the population of smbhs at later times ( out to @xmath33 ) by way of a toy model in which all bhs grow at @xmath90 of the eddington limit , and a more realistic one in which they do so only for a short period after their host haloes experienced a merger in which both haloes exceed the cosmological jeans mass . in both pairs of models",
    ", we found that the effects of bsms on observable quantities(i ) the total mass density of nuclear bhs , ( ii ) their mass function , ( iii ) their contributions to photoheating the igm , and ( iv ) their merger rates  to be marginal .",
    "the only exception is that we found the bsms could suppress the masses of the most massive bhs at @xmath149 ; however , the suppression occurs only for the rarest objects that are unlikely to be found by _",
    "jwst _ in any case .",
    "our models suggest that the suppression of the nuclear bh population could be much greater at @xmath4 , but it is unclear whether this has observational consequences .",
    "although we have only considered popiii seeds , a simple extrapolation of our findings suggests that models with more massive seeds , in which seeds form later ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , would be even less affected by bsms .    an important caveat to the above summary is that we have assumed that the suppression by bsms of the cold gas content in dm minihaloes only affects bh seed formation , and not their subsequent growth .",
    "essentially , we have assumed that the amount of gas in the host halo is not a bottleneck for bh growth .",
    "there are extreme examples , such as present - day dwarf galaxies or the @xmath156 minihaloes far below the cosmological jeans mass in our simulations , where the severe dearth of cool gas can almost completely inhibit bh growth ; but the suppression by bsms of the cold gas fraction and central gas densities at @xmath157 is thought to typically only be a factor of a few ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . since nuclear bhs typically consume less than @xmath27 per cent of the total baryonic mass in their host haloes , the factors that limit their growth are unlikely to be directly related to factors of a few in the amount of gas in the halo , but rather to opportunity ( e.g. frequency of major mergers of the host halo ) or other regulatory mechanisms ( local or global feedback )",
    ". the nuclear bh population may be more sensitive to suppression by bsms if bh masses tend to scale strongly with the cold gas fraction of the host halo , or if growing bhs is somehow extremely sensitive to the gas content of the host at @xmath158 ( e.g. through density and temperature thresholds for feedback or secular instabilities that could help fuel bh growth ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that bsms can help drive turbulence inside minihaloes , which can impact the gas accretion rates and thus affect both the popiii star masses as well as the growth of the seed bhs they leave behind ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another caveat is the use of the cosmological jeans mass in regulating bh formation and growth .",
    "it has been suggested that the more pertinent mass scale may instead be the so - called filtering mass , which depends on the prior temperature history of the igm @xcite .",
    "the jeans mass may overestimate by a factor of a few the halo mass scale on which negative feedback from igm heating becomes effective ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in a similar vein , if the merger time - scales of bhs depend sensitively on the gas content and density profiles of their host ( e.g. @xcite ) , then bsms may act to suppress or flatten the bh merger event rate as a function of redshift .",
    "we have also not included in our merger trees the suppression of dm halo abundances by bsms .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that this effect may be as important at @xmath159 as the increase in @xmath160 ( the threshold halo mass for popiii star formation ) . accounting for this effect would also somewhat increase the impact of the bsms .",
    "however , considering that this suppression is about a factor of 2 at @xmath159 and that its relative importance is much lower at @xmath161 when bsms are greatest , it is unlikely to change our basic conclusion .    we conclude that unless smbh growth and mergers are extremely sensitive to order - unity fluctuations in the cold gas density of their host haloes , bsms are unlikely to play a dramatic role in suppressing the formation of the first smbhs",
    ". they may reduce the luminosities ( masses ) of the most luminous quasars at @xmath149 by a factor of a few , but otherwise we find the overall average effect on the nuclear bh population and their observables at @xmath162 to be marginal .",
    "bsms could , however , still leave detectable imprints on small ( @xmath163 ) scales .",
    "if quasars and galaxies are systematically less luminous in regions affected by bsms , such spatial correlations could be detectable in future large - area , high - redshift surveys that measure clustering properties of quasars and galaxies ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , spatial correlations in quasar luminosity and star formation can cause reionization to take place more inhomogeneously , which could leave detectable imprints in the 21 cm power spectrum @xcite .",
