    "inertial particles moving in a turbulent flow do not simply trace the paths of fluid elements since particle inertia allows the particles to detach from the local fluid .",
    "this causes small - scale spatial clustering even in incompressible turbulence  @xcite .",
    "moreover , _ preferential sampling _ of regions with high vorticity / strain is observed for particles that are lighter / heavier than the fluid . as a result , the statistical properties of inertial heavy or light particles [ for example water droplets in turbulent clouds  @xcite or air bubbles in water  @xcite ] in turbulence are highly non - trivial both at sub - viscous and larger scales .",
    "an important example is the case of inertial particle accelerations @xcite , see also the review by @xcite . at large inertia , singularities ( caustics )",
    "occur in the dynamics of heavy particles @xcite , giving rise to large relative velocities between close particles @xcite , and leading eventually to an enhancement of collision rates  @xcite .",
    "+ the dynamics of light particles is important because of its relevance to fundamental and applied questions .",
    "light particles can be used as small probes that preferentially track high vorticity structures , highlighting statistical and topological properties of the underlying fluid conditioned on those structures . in the limit of high volume fractions",
    "they might also have a complex feedback on the flow , including the case of reducing the turbulent drag @xcite . compared to heavy particles the dynamics of light particles",
    "is more difficult to analyse because pressure - gradient forces  @xcite and added - mass effects must be taken into account .",
    "apart from the fact that light particles tend to be drawn into vortices there is little theoretical analysis of their dynamics in turbulent flows .",
    "this motivated us to formulate a _ closure scheme _ that allows us to compute inertial accelerations of both heavy and light particles in turbulence .",
    "we describe the scheme and we test it by comparing its predictions to results of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "we consider a simple model for the particle dynamics , taking into account added - mass and pressure - gradient forces , but neglecting the effect of buoyancy on the acceleration as well as the basset - boussinesq history force , as in many previous dns studies @xcite .",
    "we comment on these questions in the conclusions .",
    "our scheme for the inertial particle accelerations approximates the particle paths by the lagrangian fluid - element paths .",
    "it is a closure for the particle equation of motion that neglects _ inertial preferential sampling _ such as heavy inertial particles being centrifuged out of long - lived vortical regions of the flow  @xcite , so that they preferentially sample straining regions , or light particles which by contrast are drawn into vortices @xcite .",
    "the latter is simply a consequence of the fact that light particles are influenced by pressure gradients in the undisturbed flow",
    ". our approximation can not be quantitatively correct when inertial preferential sampling is significant , but overall it yields a good qualitative description of how particle accelerations depend on the particle density relative to that of the fluid , and upon the _ stokes number _",
    ", a dimensionless measure of particle inertia .",
    "moreover , and more interestingly , the closure also predicts highly non - trivial properties of the intermittent , non - gaussian acceleration fluctuations , as the magnitude of inertial effects and the reynolds number of the turbulence change .",
    "for example , the closure scheme predicts that the flatness of the acceleration develops a maximum or a minimum as a function of @xmath0 for light or heavy particles .",
    "this is in good qualitative agreement with the measurements on the dns data . for heavy particles the closure fails",
    "when inertial preferential sampling affects inertial particle accelerations , i.e. for stokes numbers of order unity , see fig .",
    "1*b * in @xcite .",
    "in fact for heavy particles our closure is equivalent to the filtering mechanism discussed by @xcite . for light particles , by contrast ,",
    "comparisons to dns results show that inertial preferential sampling effects are strong only at very large stokes numbers , @xmath1 , leading to an enlarged range of small and intermediate values of @xmath0 where the closure works qualitatively well .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem , introduce the equations of motion and qualitatively discuss inertial preferential sampling . in section [ sec : closure ]",
    "we describe our lagrangian closure scheme for inertial particle accelerations .",
    "data from dns of turbulent flows are analysed in section  [ sec : turbo ] together with a detailed comparison to the predictions from the closure scheme .",
    "in section  [ sec : stat_model ] , we assess the potentialities of the closure on a data set obtained using a stochastic surrogate for the fluid velocity field .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains the conclusions .",
    "many studies have considered the dynamics of heavy inertial particles , much denser than the carrying fluid . when the particles are very heavy and at the same time very small ( point particles ) the motion is simply determined by stokes drag .",
    "the dynamics of light particles by contrast is also affected by pressure gradients of the unperturbed fluid , and added - mass effects . neglecting the effect of gravitational settling ( and thus buoyancy )",
    "the equation of motion reads : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle position at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is the particle velocity , @xmath6 is the velocity field of the undisturbed fluid and @xmath7 is the lagrangian derivative . the dimensionless constant @xmath8 accounts for the contrast between particle density @xmath9 and fluid density @xmath10 , while the stokes number is defined as @xmath11 where the particle response time is @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the particle radius , @xmath14 the kinematic viscosity of the flow and @xmath15 the kolmogorov time defined in terms of the fluid energy dissipation , @xmath16 .",
    "many studies have employed this model @xcite .",
    "the model takes into account added - mass effects but neglects buoyancy forces .",
    "it is an open question under which circumstances this is a quantitative model for the acceleration of small particles in turbulence .",
    "the following analysis is based on eqs .",
    "( [ mrfc ] ) .",
    "it is important to first understand this case before addressing more realistic situations ( inclusion of buoyancy , finite size , collisions and feedback on the flow ) .",
    "the sources of the difficulties are twofold .",
    "first , even in the much simpler case of a non - turbulent eulerian velocity field @xmath17 the particle dynamics is still complicated and often chaotic , simply because eqs .",
    "( [ mrfc ] ) are nonlinear .",
    "second , turbulence makes the problem even harder due to the existence of substantial spatial and temporal fluctuations .",
    "this results in chaotic lagrangian dynamics of fluid elements .",
    "note that even though lagrangian fluid elements sample space uniformly , their instantaneous motion is in general correlated with structures in the underlying flow .",
    "this implies that multi - time lagrangian flow correlation functions evaluated along tracer trajectories do not coincide with the underlying eulerian correlation functions which are evaluated at fixed positions in space .",
    "particles that are heavier or lighter than the fluid may detach from the flow if they have inertia .",
    "this leads to the _ inertial preferential sampling _ mentioned in the introduction . as a result , the flow statistics experienced by an inertial particle differs from that of a lagrangian fluid element .",
    "let us notice that the dynamics determined by equation ( [ mrfc ] ) tends to the evolution of a tracer in both limits @xmath18 and @xmath19 . indeed , in the limit @xmath20 , imposing a finite stokes drag leads to @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath22 , by contrast we may approximate the material derivative along fluid tracers trajectories with the derivative along the trajectory of a particle , @xmath23 , and consistently check that the evolution of ( [ mrfc ] ) leads to an exponential relaxation of the evolution of the particle to the trajectory of the tracer .",
    "hence , the idea is to approximate the effects of inertial forces on the particle trajectory starting from the evolution of tracers .",
    "this approach can not be exact .",
    "it is for example known that vortices are preferentially sampled by inertial particles .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to understand and quantify how big the difference is as a function of the distance in the parameter phase space , @xmath24 , from the two lines @xmath25 or @xmath26 where the closure must be exact ( see .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] ) .",
    "the starting point is to evaluate ( [ mrfc ] ) along tracer trajectories : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the lagrangian trajectory of a tracer particle .",
    "this approximation is a _ closure _ in the sense that the first equation in ( [ mrfc2 ] ) is independent of the second one , and the second equation can be solved in terms of the lagrangian velocity statistics @xmath29 of the underlying flow .",
    "we solve ( [ mrfc2 ] ) for @xmath30 ( disregarding initial conditions here and below because these do not matter for the steady - state statistics ) to obtain @xmath31 using this expression , the particle acceleration follows from the second of eqs .",
    "( [ mrfc2 ] ) @xmath32 using eq .",

    "( [ acorr ] ) @xmath36 similarly , the fourth moment of the particle acceleration is obtained as : @xmath37 here isotropy of the acceleration components @xmath38\\langle a_1 ^ 4\\rangle/3 $ ] was used to express @xmath39 in terms of the four - point lagrangian correlation function @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a component of the fluid acceleration and @xmath42 is the spatial dimension .",
    "( [ acorr ] ) , ( [ avar ] ) and ( [ aquad ] ) express the fluctuations of inertial particle accelerations in terms of lagrangian correlation functions of the underlying flow , and predict how the inertial particle accelerations depend on @xmath43 and @xmath0 .",
    "the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ avar ] ) and ( [ aquad ] ) are hard to evaluate numerically for very small and for very large values of @xmath0 . when @xmath0 is small , the exponential factors in the right - hand side of ( [ avar ] ) and ( [ aquad ] ) become singular and one needs a very high sampling frequency of the fluid acceleration along the particle trajectory to evaluate the integrals reliably .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , on the other hand , the integrals sum up large - time contributions with large fluctuations due to the finite length of experimental and numerical trajectories . before we proceed to a quantitative assessment of the model",
    "let us make a few general remarks about the range of applicability and accuracy of the approximation made .",
    "first , in eqs .",
    "( [ avar ] ) and ( [ aquad ] ) we need to evaluate the acceleration correlation function of the tracers for general values of @xmath4 .",
    "this might be seen as a problem because the trajectories of tracers and of inertial particles must depart on a time scale of the order of the lyapunov time . on the other hand ,",
    "the acceleration correlation function of the tracer is known to decay on a time of the order of the kolmogorov time , @xmath44 , which is ten times smaller than the typical lyapunov time of heavy particles @xcite and stays close to zero in the inertial range of scales @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not see any problem in the evaluation of the integrals in the above equations .",
    "second , we are only interested in stationary properties of the inertial particle statistics and we always assume that the initial conditions for all particles are chosen from their stationary distribution functions .",
    "as a result no influence of the initial condition should appear in the closure .",
    "the lagrangian closure adopted here can also be applied to correlation functions of other observables of the particle , or of the flow , provided that the underlying lagrangian correlation functions decay quickly enough . here , we focus on the acceleration statistics because of their highly non - gaussian properties and high sensitivity to the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath0 .",
    "finally , let us stress that our closure is fully based on lagrangian properties and does require the use of any eulerian correlation function , as opposed to closures based on the fast eulerian approach by @xcite or the lagrangian - eulerian closure to predict two - particle distributions @xcite . to make further progress we need to determine the lagrangian correlation functions .",
    "in section [ sec : turbo ] we present the most important new results , we determine the lagrangian correlation functions by dns of inertial particle dynamics in turbulence , substitute into eqs .",
    "( [ acorr ] ) , ( [ avar ] ) and ( [ aquad ] ) and assess the accuracy of these equations in predicting particle acceleration fluctuations and correlations .",

    "the statistical model has no internal intermittency , i.e. there is no reynolds number dependency on the acceleration statistics ( there is not even the meaning of a reynolds number ) .",
    "nevertheless , once the gaussian eulerian velocity field is prescribed , we can calculate the acceleration probability density function of the fluid tracers .",

    "the departure from the numerical data is a signature of the corresponding importance of preferential sampling at those stokes numbers .",
    "let us notice nevertheless an important difference with respect to the dns data . here",
    "the absolute values of the flatness are much smaller , due to the absence of internal intermittency . in the stochastic signal",
    "the acceleration of the fluid is non - gaussian only because of kinematic effects . in real flows ,",
    "the acceleration is more intense and more fluctuating because of the vortex stretching mechanism and of the turbulent energy cascade .",
    "in this paper we have analysed a lagrangian closure describing fluctuations and correlations of inertial particle accelerations in turbulent flows in the diluted regime ( one - way coupling ) , i.e. neglecting particle - particle collisions and feedback on the flow . in this way",
    ", we have a model that is able to predict some properties of the acceleration statistics of inertial particles for a large range of values of @xmath43 and @xmath0 out of one single measurement based on fluid tracers only .",
    "we have compared the predictions of the closure to dns of heavy and light inertial particles in turbulence . to summarize our results ,",
    "the closure predictions are in overall good qualitative agreement with the results of dns of particles .",
    "the closure neglects inertial preferential sampling , i.e. the tendency of light / heavy particles to be centrifuged in or out of vortex structures .",
    "hence , the good agreement with the dns data indicates that inertial preferential sampling has in general only a partial effect on inertial particle accelerations .",
    "the main trends are essentially kinematic , a consequence of the form of the equation of motion , as also shown by the results obtained using a stochastic surrogate for the flow velocity .",
    "a closer inspection shows that there are important differences between the lagrangian closure scheme and the dns , revealing where inertial preferential sampling is important .",
    "the effect is larger for light particles at large stokes numbers ( @xmath1 in our dns ) , and is a consequence of the fact that light bubbles are drawn into intense vortex tubes .",
    "we mention that there is no small - scale fractal clustering for these values of @xmath0 , i.e. particles are distributed on a three - dimensional set at scales much smaller than the kolmogorov length .",
    "finally , non - trivial non - monotonic behaviours of the flatness for both light and heavy particles as a function of @xmath0 are predicted by the closure scheme and confirmed by the dns results , including the fact that light particles are always more intermittent than the fluid tracers and the opposite holds for heavy particles , as shown by the fact that the flatness for the former is always larger than the one of fluid tracers and vice versa for the latter .",
    "the lagrangian closure scheme must become exact when @xmath92 or @xmath139 , it should therefore be possible to see it as a perturbative expansion around lagrangian tracers and proportional to a small parameter @xmath140 , at least for quantities that depend on lagrangian correlation functions decaying on a time scale of the order of the kolmogorov time . in this case , one could try to develop an intermediate asymptotic where for small enough time the difference between the two trajectories remains small and then improve the zeroth - order approximation here presented by considering also corrections induced by the velocity gradients around the lagrangian tracers : @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "finally , we have also investigated the validity of the lagrangian closure using a stochastic gaussian surrogate for the advecting fluid velocity field .",
    "in such a case , the @xmath143 number is another free parameter that can be tuned to increase / decrease the effects of inertial preferential sampling ( effects vanish as @xmath143 approaches zero ) .",
    "we have shown that for large kubo numbers , corresponding to the long - lived structures in turbulent flows , the closure theory works as well as for the dns data , even though the data for the statistical model have a much smaller flatness .",
    "+ let us add some remarks about the generality and the limitations of the approach proposed .",
    "first , there are no theoretical difficulties in incorporating buoyancy , faxn corrections and other forces in the closure scheme as long as the dynamics can be described by a point - particle approach . we refrained from presenting here the results because of lack of dns data to compare with . on the other hand , it is known that the equations ( [ mrfc ] ) are not valid for all values in the ( @xmath144 ) parameter space .",
    "indeed , the two requirements that the reynolds number based on the particle slip velocity is small : @xmath145 and that the particle size is smaller than the kolmogorov scale @xmath146 lead to the condition that @xmath147 if @xmath148 . so the prediction of the model in the limit of large stokes numbers for light particles can not be taken on a quantitative basis .",
    "we stress nevertheless that the most interesting property highlighted by our approach , i.e. the existence of a non - monotonic behaviour for the flatness of the acceleration of light and heavy particles , develops at values of @xmath0 where the model equations are still valid .",
    "it is difficult to precisely assess the value of stokes where the approximation breaks down .",

    "for such a range of particle parameters no theoretical models for the equations of motion are known .",
