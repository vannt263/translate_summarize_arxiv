    "the wmap satellite has just released the first full sky maps produced after more than one year of operation ( bennett et al .",
    "these data mark an important step in cosmology : they represent in fact the first publicly available multi - band high - resolution full - sky survey of the microwave sky .",
    "the wmap survey is likely to remain the highest - quality cmb temperature anisotropy survey until the launch of the planck satellite not earlier than 2007 .",
    "although the exercise of parameter fitting with each new experiment has produced in the last few years a copious literature , the new wmap data are certainly on a class of its own and deserve to be taken fully into account . here we address the question of what the first year of wmap data can tell us about the property of dark energy .",
    "five years after the first observational hints about the existence of a dominant component of unclustered matter with negative pressure ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , the so - called dark energy or quintessence ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ; frieman et al . 1995 ; ferreira & joyce 1997 ; caldwell et al . 1998 ) , there are still very few indications as to its nature . the main reason , perhaps , is that we lack any specific theoretical suggestion on the properties of the dark energy , i.e. on its self - interaction potential and on how it interacts with the other cosmological components .",
    "several works have tried to constrain dark energy models with pre - wmap high resolution cmb data , leading to bounds on the dark energy equation of state . unless strong priors on the other cosmological parameters are imposed , however , these bounds turned out to be rather weak .",
    "in particular , the hubble constant is strongly degenerated with the dark energy present equation of state , @xmath4 ( huey et al .",
    "for instance , with a flat prior @xmath5 , amendola et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that essentially all values @xmath6 were allowed , while @xmath7 if @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , adopting the hst value @xmath9 ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and using updated data melchiorri et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found @xmath10 at 95% c.l .",
    "( they included also values @xmath11 ) .",
    "other works that addressed the same issue includes corasaniti & copeland ( 2002 ) , baccigalupi et al .",
    "with pre - wmap data , only the imposition of a low value of @xmath12 ( e.g. @xmath13 ) could allow to distinguish dynamical dark energy from a pure cosmological constant ( or , more precisely , from a fluid possessing an equation of state close to @xmath14 at the present ) .    in reality",
    ", all the constraints for cmb presented in the literature on the dark energy equation of state are necessarily somewhat model - dependent , since the fundamental quantity , namely the angular - diameter distance to last scattering , in general depends on @xmath4 through two integrals over the cosmic evolution that do not allow to distinguish among different parameters along degeneracy curves .",
    "although at low @xmath15s the geometric degeneracy could in principle be broken by the isw effect , the cosmic variance and the weakness of the effect make this possibility unrealistic in most cases . here , as in several other works on the topics , we restrict therefore our attention to two classes of models which are at the same time general ( in the sense of covering most modelizations ) and simple .",
    "the initial conditions are choosen so that the trajectories reach the tracking solutions ( notice that off - tracking solutions are indistinguishable from a cosmological constant ) .",
    "first , we consider dark energy as a scalar field with inverse power - law potentials @xmath16 ( ratra & peebles 1988 ) , which recovers the exponential potentials for large values of @xmath17 ; in this case , the equation of state at the present is roughly constant@xmath18 due to the tracking mechanism ( steinhardt et al .",
    "this approximates also the cases in which the dark energy is a perfect fluid with constant @xmath19 since the angular size of the acoustic horizon depend on the equation of state only , and includes also the cases in which @xmath4 is the @xmath20-weighted average of a slowly - varying function @xmath21 ( see e.g. doran et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the wmap team analysed their power spectrum including dark energy with a constant equation of state ( and no coupling ) .",
    "they found for the equation of state @xmath22 with cmb data alone and @xmath23 including supernovae ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "although dark energy with an inverse power - law potential has an equation of state which is constant only near the present epoch , we will recover very similar results for this class of models , as expected .    in the second class",
    "we include models of dark energy coupled to dark matter ( amendola 2000 ; amendola et al .",
    "2002 ) . this class of models , in which we include the conformally related brans - dicke lagrangians , has been widely studied in the context of dark energy ( uzan 1999 , chiba 1999 , chen & kamionkowski 1999 , baccigalupi et al .",

    "2000 , billyard & coley 2000 , bean & magueijo 2000 , esposito - farese & polarsky 2001 , sen & sen 2001 , gasperini et al . 2002 ,",
    "pietroni 2002 ) it is important to stress that the behavior of coupled dark energy can not be modeled simply by some choice of the equation of state for @xmath24 because the interaction induces on dark matter an effective equation of state different from zero . in this case",
    "dark energy mediates a long - range scalar interaction that modifies the gravity felt by dark matter particles through a yukawa - type term ( damour et al .",
    "on newtonian scales , the interaction simply renormalizes newton s constant for dark matter @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dimensionless coupling , while the baryons remain uncoupled ( or very weakly coupled , as required by experimental constraints , see e.g. hagiwara et al .",
    "then , dark energy effectively violates the equivalence principle , but in a way that is locally unobservable . for as concerns us ,",
    "the main effect of the coupling is to induce an exchange of energy between the two dominating dark components so that , after equivalence but before acceleration , the universe enters a regime in which not only the equation of state ( as in the tracking case ) but also the density parameters @xmath27 are constant . in amendola ( 2001 )",
    "this regime was called @xmath24mde , to remark the fact that matter is not the only dominating component .",
    "this epoch ends when the dark energy enters the tracking regime , the potential energy takes over and accelerates the expansion . during @xmath24mde we have @xmath28 and an effective equation of state for the coupled fluid dark matter / dark energy @xmath29 note that this behavior is an example of `` early quintessence '' ( caldwell et al . 2003 ) , in which the dark energy density is not negligible at last scattering .",
    "scope of this paper is to constrain both equations of state , the present one , @xmath4 and the past one , @xmath30 .",
    "this will put limits on the two `` fundamental '' parameters @xmath31 .",
    "a value @xmath32 would imply that the dark energy is not a pure cosmological constant , while a value @xmath33 would imply a large - scale violation of the equivalence principle . in the following",
    "we will use interchangeably the parameters @xmath34 or @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the background trajectories for the uncoupled ( @xmath35 ) and coupled ( @xmath36 ) cases , assuming @xmath37 .",
    "notice the plateau of constant @xmath20 in the coupled model .",
    "we start with assuming no coupling , @xmath35 , and varying @xmath4 along with @xmath38 and the slope @xmath39 of the primordial fluctuations",
    ". then we include @xmath26 and constrain both @xmath4 and @xmath30 .",
    "we assume a flat space throughout .",
    "notice that our @xmath40 refers to cold dark matter only , so that the total matter content is @xmath41 .",
    "the class of models considered in this paper is the same as in amendola et al .",
    "we compare the models to the combined power spectrum estimated by wmap ( hinshaw et al .",
    "2003 ) . to derive the likelihood",
    "we adopt a version of the routine described in verde et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which takes into account all the relevant experimental properties ( calibration , beam uncertainties , window functions , etc ) . since the likelihood routine employs approximations that work only for spectra not too far from the data , we run it only for models whose @xmath42 is less than four times the degrees of freedom .",
    "we experimented with increasing the @xmath42 cut and found no important variations .",
    "we also compare the data to the whole set of pre - wmap data . to do this",
    ", we use the power spectrum provided by wang , tegmark and zaldarriaga ( 2002 ) , which is a compression of essentially all the available data up to mid-2002 in 25 @xmath15-bins from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , complete of correlation matrix and window functions ( calibration and beam uncertainty are included in the correlation matrix ) . the main entries in this compilation are cobe ( bennett et al .",

    "we add archeops ( benoit et al . 2002 ) with its correlation matrix , window functions , beam and calibration uncertainties . for the pre - wmap data we assumed no reionization ( @xmath45 ) because this was the best fit before wmap .",
    "for the pre - wmap data we integrated out analytically the calibration and beam uncertainties and the overall normalization .",
    "let us denote with @xmath46 the correlation matrix , the calibration uncertainty and the beam uncertainty , respectively , of the @xmath47-th experiment , and with @xmath48 a vector of dimension equal to the number of bins in the @xmath47-th experiment .",
    "moreover , let @xmath49 be the theoretical cmb spectrum binned in the @xmath15-th bin with the experimental window function .",
    "then one gets the remarkably simple likelihood function ( see appendix)@xmath50\\ ] ] where@xmath51 where the matrix @xmath52 is@xmath53 and where @xmath54 and @xmath55 and where the vector @xmath56 expresses the dependence on @xmath15 of the beam uncertainty ( in the case of a gaussian beam , @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is the likelihood we use for the pre - wmap data .",
    "our theoretical model depends on two scalar field parameters , four cosmological parameters and the overall normalization : @xmath58 as anticipated , to save computing time we found it necessary to restrict the analysis to a flat space ; moreover , we fixed the optical depth to @xmath59 , the best fit found by map ( spergel et al .",
    "we derived the likelihood also for @xmath60 and found no significative differences for as concerns the two dark energy parameters @xmath31 .",
    "the initial conditions for the scalar field are found iteratively for each set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the overall normalization has been integrated out numerically .",
    "since @xmath61 determine uniquely the present and past equations of state , we will present the likelihood also as function of @xmath34 .",
    "we calculate the theoretical @xmath62 spectra by a modified parallelized cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) code that includes the full set of coupled perturbation equations ( see amendola 2000 and amendola & tocchini - valentini 2001 ) .",
    "the other parameters are set as follows : @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "we evaluated the likelihood on two grids of roughly @xmath65 models each ( for each normalization ) : a sparse grid that covers a broad volume was used as a preliminary exploration ; a second denser grid centered on the peaks of the first was then used for the actual calculations . for the first grid we adopted the following top - hat broad priors : @xmath66 @xmath67  @xmath68 @xmath69  @xmath70 .",
    "for the hubble constant we adopted the top - hat prior @xmath71 we also employed the hst result ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath9 ( gaussian prior ) but found only minor differences , since the wmap results are already very close to the hst distribution .",
    "the same age constraint ( @xmath72 gyr ) used in most previous analyses is adopted here .",
    "we begin by putting @xmath35 and assuming @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the likelihood for each parameter , marginalizing in turn over the others .",
    "the dotted line is for the hst prior @xmath9 .",
    "notice that , due to the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath12 , the limits on @xmath4 are rather weak , especially if no prior is assumed .",
    "the numerical results are in table i. here and in the following the limits are always at the 68%(95% ) c.l .",
    "while the errors are at 68% c.l .. as expected , we find results very close to those in spergel et al .",
    "the small residual differences are probably due to the fact we use a grid instead of a markov chain and fix @xmath74 instead of marginalizing over it .",

    "1990 ; the radiation is automatically uncoupled with this coupling , see e.g. amendola 1999 ) .",
    "the dimensionless coupling @xmath91 can be seen as the ratio of the dark energy - dark matter interaction with respect to gravity ( damour & nordtvedt 1993 , wetterich 1995 ) . in amendola ( 2001 )",

    "we will consider only @xmath92    it is important to observe that the cmb bounds on @xmath26 depend on the existence of the @xmath24mde .",
    "this epoch has several features that distinguish it from tracking : it is very long ( from equivalence to @xmath93 ) ; it depends only on the kinetic energy of the dark energy , and therefore is independent of the dark energy potential ; it can not be avoided even assuming an extremely small initial dark energy density ( contrary to the tracking that may be avoided by selecting initial conditions with very low scalar field energy  the so - called `` undershooting '' trajectories ) .",

    "the striking difference between the level of the two constraints in ( [ cons ] ) indicates that the cmb is more sensitive to the dark energy coupling than to its potential , as emphasized in amendola et al .",

    "<S> the satellite experiment wmap has produced for the first time a high - coverage , high - resolution survey of the microwave sky , releasing publicly available data that are likely to remain unrivalled for years to come . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare the wmap temperature power spectrum , along with an exhaustive compilation of previous experiments , to models of dark energy that allow for a tracking epoch at the present , deriving updated bounds on the dark energy equation of state and the other cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we complement the analysis by including a coupling of the dark energy to dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are : _ a _ ) the wmap data alone constrain the equation of state of tracking dark energy to be @xmath0 to 68%(95% ) ( confining the analysis to @xmath1 ) , which implies for an inverse power - law potential an exponent @xmath2 ; _ b _ ) the dimensionless coupling to dark matter is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> including the results from the supernovae ia further constrains the dark energy equation of state . </S>"
