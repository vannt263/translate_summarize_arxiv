    "one of the major difficulties in observationally constraining the formation and evolutionary histories of galaxies is that there is no good observational tracer of formation time or age . in the simplest possible terms , galaxies grow through a combination of continuous and/or stochastic star formation and episodic mergers . throughout this process  and in contrast to other global properties like luminosity , star formation rate , restframe colour , or luminosity - weighted mean stellar age  a galaxy s evolution in stellar mass is nearly monotonic and relatively slow .",
    "stellar mass thus provides a good , practical basis for evolutionary studies .",
    "further , it is now clear that stellar mass plays a central role in determining  or at least describing  a galaxy s evolutionary state .",
    "virtually all of the global properties commonly used to describe galaxies  e.g . ,",
    "luminosity , restframe colour , size , structure , star formation rate , mean stellar age , metallicity , local density , and velocity dispersion or rotation velocity  are strongly and tightly correlated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one of most influential insights to come from the ambitious wide- and deep - field galaxy censuses of the 2000s has been the idea that most , if not all , of these correlations can be best understood as being primarily a sequence in stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "given a galaxy s stellar mass , it is thus possible to predict most other global properties with considerable accuracy .",
    "presumably , key information about the physical processes that govern the process of galaxy formation and evolution are encoded in the forms of , and scatter around , these stellar mass scaling relations .",
    "-1      this paper presents the first catalogue of stellar mass estimates for galaxies in the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite . at its core , gama is an optical spectroscopic redshift survey , specifically designed to have near total spectroscopic completeness over cosmologically representative volume . in terms of survey area and target surface density , gama is intermediate and complementary to wide - field , low - redshift galaxy censuses like sdss @xcite , 2dfgrs @xcite , 6dfgs @xcite , or the mgc @xcite and deep - field surveys of the high redshift universe like vvds @xcite , deep-2 @xcite , combo-17 @xcite , cosmos and zcosmos @xcite .",
    "the intermediate redshift regime ( @xmath8 ) that gama probes is thus largely unexplored territory : gama provides a unique resource for studies of the evolving properties of the general galaxy population .    in a broader sense , gama aims to unite data from a number of large survey projects spanning nearly the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum , and using many of the world s best telescopes . at present , the photometric backbone of the dataset is optical imaging from sdss and near infrared ( nir ) imaging taken as part of the large area survey ( las ) component of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galex uv imaging from the medium imaging survey ( mis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is available for the full gama survey region . at longer wavelengths , mid - infrared imaging is available from the wise all - sky survey @xcite",
    ", far infrared imaging is available from the herschel - atlas project @xcite , and metre - wavelength radio imaging is being obtained using the giant metre - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ; pi : m.  jarvis ) . in the near future , the sdss and ukidss imaging will be superseded by significantly deeper , sub - arcsecond resolution imaging from the vst - kids project ( pi : k.  kuijken ) and from the vista - viking survey ( pi : w.sutherland ) .",
    "looking slightly further ahead , a subset of the gama fields will also be targeted by the askap - dingo project ( pi : m.  meyer ) , adding 21 cm data to the mix . by combining these many different datasets into a single and truly panchromatic database",
    ", gama aims to construct ` the ultimate galaxy catalogue ' , offering the first laboratory for simultaneously studying the agn , stellar , dust , and gas components of large and representative samples of galaxies at low - to - intermediate redshifts .",
    "the stellar masses estimates , as well as estimates for ancillary stellar popualtion parameters like age , metallicity , and restframe colour , form a crucial part of the gama value - added dataset .",
    "these values are already in use within the gama team for a number of science applications .. in keeping with gama s commitment to providing these data as a useful and freely available resource , the stellar mass estimates described in this paper are being made publicly available as part of the gama data release 2 , scheduled for mid-2011 . particularly in concert with other gama value - added catalogues , and with catalogues from other wide- and deep - field galaxy surveys ,",
    "the gama stellar mass estimates are intended to provide a valuable public resource for studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a primary goal of this paper is therefore to provide a standard reference for users of these catalogues .",
    "stellar mass estimates are generally derived through stellar population synthesis ( sps ) modelling @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on stellar evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , these models describe the spectral evolution of a single - aged or simple stellar population ( ssp ) as a function of its age and metallicity .",
    "the idea behind sps modelling is to combine the individual ssp models according to some fiducial star formation history ( sfh ) , and so to construct composite stellar populations ( csps ) that match the observed properties of real galaxies .",
    "the stellar population ( sp ) parameters  including stellar mass , star formation rate , luminosity weighted mean stellar age and metallicity , and dust obscuration  implied by such a fit can then be ascribed to the galaxy in question ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sps fitting is most commonly done using broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) or spectral indices ( see the comprehensive review by * ? ? ?",
    "this presents two interrelated challenges .",
    "first is the question of the accuracy and reliability of the spectral models that make up the stellar population library ( spl ) used as the basis of the fitting , including both the stellar evolution models that underpin the synthetic spectra , and the sfhs used to construct the spl .",
    "second , there is the question of what sed or spectral features provide the strongest and/or most robust constraints on a galaxy s sp , taking into account the uncertainties and assumptions intrinsic to the models .",
    "-1    in principle , the accuracy of sps - derived parameter estimates is limited by generic degeneracies between different sp models with the same or similar observable properties  for example , the well known dust  age  metallicity degeneracy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further , the sps fitting problem is typically badly under - constrained , inasmuch as it is extremely difficult to place meaningful constraints on a given galaxy s particular sfh .",
    "this issue has been recently explored by @xcite , who tested their ability to recover the known sp parameters of mock galaxies , in order to determine the limiting accuracy of stellar mass estimates . in the highly idealised case",
    "that the spl contains a perfect description of each and every galaxy , and that the photometry is perfectly calibrated , and that the dust extinction is known exactly , @xcite argue that sp model degeneracies mean that both spectroscopic and photometric stellar mass estimates are generically limited to an accuracy of @xmath9 dex for galaxies with a strong burst component , and @xmath10 dex otherwise .    in practice ,",
    "the dominant uncertainties in sps - derived parameter estimates are likely to come from uncertainties inherent to the sp models themselves . despite the considerable progress that has been made ,",
    "there remain a number of important ` known unknowns ' .",
    "the form and universality ( or otherwise ) of the stellar imf is a major source of uncertainty @xcite . from the stellar evolution side , the treatment of nir - luminous thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars ( tp - agbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the subject of some controversy . as a third example",
    ", there is the question of how to appropriately model the effects of dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , including both the form of the dust obscuration / extinction law , and the precise geometry of the dust with respect to the stars @xcite .",
    "many of these uncertainties and their propagation through to stellar mass estimates are throughly explored and quantified in the excellent work of @xcite , who argue that ( when fitting to full uv  to  nir seds ) the net uncertainty in any individual @xmath11 stellar mass determination is on the order of @xmath12 dex .",
    "differential systematic errors across galaxy populations  that is , biases in the stellar masses of different galaxies as a function of mass , age , sfh , etc.are at least as great a concern as the net uncertainty on any individual galaxy .",
    "the vast majority of stellar mass - based science focusses on differences in the ( average ) properties of galaxies as a function of inferred mass . in such comparative studies , differential biases",
    "have the potential to induce a spurious signal , or , conversely , to mask true signal . in this context",
    ", @xcite have used the consistency between stellar and dynamical mass estimates for sdss galaxies to argue that any such differential biases in @xmath4 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xmath13 ) as a function of stellar population are limited to @xmath14 dex ( 40 % ) ; _ i.e. _ , small .    in a similar way ,",
    "systematic differential biases in the masses and sp parameters of galaxies at different redshifts are a major concern for evolutionary studies , inasmuch as any such redshift - dependent biases will induce a false evolutionary signal . indeed , for the specific example of measurement of the evolving comoving number density of massive galaxies at @xmath15 , such differential errors are the single largest source of uncertainty , random or systematic @xcite",
    ". more generally , such differential biases will be generically important whenever the low redshift point makes a significant contribution to the evolutionary signal ; that is , whenever the amount of evolution is comparable to the random errors on the high redshift points . in this context , by probing the intermediate redshift regime and providing a link between @xmath16 surveys like sdss and 2dfgrs and @xmath17 deep surveys like vvds and deep-2 , gama makes it possible to identify and correct for any such differential effects .",
    "gama thus has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate a major source of uncertainty for a wide variety of lookback survey results .",
    "-1      before we begin , a few words on the ethos behind our sps modelling procedure : we have deliberately set out to do things as simply and as conventionally as is possible and appropriate .",
    "there are two main reasons for this decision .",
    "first , this is only the first generation of stellar mass estimates for gama .",
    "we intend to use the results presented here to inform and guide future improvements and refinements to our sps fitting algorithm .",
    "second , in the context of studying galaxy evolution , gama s unique contribution is to probe the intermediate redshift regime ; gama becomes most powerful when combined with very wide low redshift galaxy censuses on the one hand , and with very deep lookback surveys on the other .",
    "to maximise gama s utility , it is therefore highly desirable to provide masses that are directly comparable to estimates used by other survey teams .",
    "this includes using techniques that are practicable for high redshift studies .    with all of the above as background ,",
    "the programme for this paper is as follows . after describing the subset of the gama database that we will make use of in [ ch : data ] , we lay out our sps modelling procedure in [ ch : estimates ] . in particular , in [ ch : diagnostics ] , we show the importance of taking a bayesian approach to sp parameter estimation .",
    "in [ ch : nir ] , we look at how our results change with the inclusion of nir data . specifically , in [ ch : residuals ] , we show that our spl models do not yield a good description of the gama optical  to  nir sed shapes .",
    "further , in [ ch : nirvalues ] , we show that for a large fraction of galaxies , the sp parameter values derived from the full optical  plus  nir seds are formally inconsistent with those derived from just the optical data .",
    "both of these statements are true irrespective of the choice of ssp models used to construct the spl ( [ ch : sspmodels ] ) .    in order to interpret the results presented in [ ch : nir ] ,",
    "we have conducted a set of numerical experiments designed to test our ability to fit synthetic galaxies photometry , and to recover the ` known ' sp parameters of mock galaxies . based on these tests , which we describe in appendix [ ch :",
    "mocks ] , we have no reason to expect the kinds of differences found in [ ch : nir]we therefore conclude that , at least for the time being , it is better for us to ignore the available nir data [ ch : nonir ] .    in light of our decision not to use the available nir data , in [ ch : gimoverl ] , we investigate how well optical data can be used to constrain a galaxy s @xmath18 . using the spl models , we show in [ ch : gimodels ] that , in principle",
    ", @xmath3 colour can be used to estimate @xmath4 to within a factor of @xmath19 . in [ ch : colourrel ] , we use the empirical relation between ( @xmath20-derived ) @xmath4 and @xmath3 colour to show that , in practice , @xmath3 can be used to infer @xmath4 to an accuracy of @xmath21 dex . the derived colour@xmath22 relation presented in this section",
    "is provided to enable meaningful comparison between stellar mass - centric measurements from gama and other surveys .    finally , in [ ch :",
    "discuss ] , we discuss how we might improve on the current sp parameter estimates for future catalogues . in particular , in [ ch : future ] , we examine potential causes and solutions for our current problems in incorporating the nir data . in this section",
    ", we suggest that we have reached the practical limit for sp parameter estimation based on grid - search - like algorithms using a static spl . in order to improve on the current estimates , future efforts will require a fundamentally different conceptual approach .",
    "however , as we argue in [ ch : nirvalue ] , this will not necessarily lead to significant improvements in the robustness or reliability of our stellar mass estimates .    separately",
    ", we compare the sdss and gama photometry and stellar mass estimates in appendix [ ch : cfsdss ] . despite there being large and systematic differences between the sdss ` model `  and gama ` auto `  seds",
    ", we find that the gama- and sdss - derived @xmath18s are in excellent agreement . on the other hand ,",
    "we also show that , as a measure of total flux , the sdss ` model `  photometry suffers from structure - dependent biases ; the differential effect is at the level of a factor of 2 .",
    "these large and systematic biases in total flux translate directly to biases in the inferred total mass . for sdss",
    ", this may in fact be the single largest source of uncertainties in their stellar mass estimates . in principle",
    ", this will have a significant impact on stellar mass - centric measurements based on sdss data .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology : @xmath23 .",
    "different choices for the value of @xmath24 can be accommodated by scaling any and all absolute magnitudes or total stellar masses by @xmath25 or @xmath26 , respectively ( _ i.e. _ , a higher value of the hubble parameter implies a lower luminosity or total mass ) .",
    "all other sp parameters , including restframe colours , ages , dust extinctions , and mass - to - light ratios can be taken to be cosmology - independent , inasmuch as they pertain to the stellar populations at the time of observation .",
    "we assume a @xcite imf .",
    "our stellar mass estimates are based on the @xcite sp models and the dust obscuration law of @xcite .",
    "we briefly consider the effect of using the @xcite or @xcite sp models on the inferred sp parameter estimates in [ ch : sspmodels ] . in discussions of stellar mass - to - light ratios",
    ", we use @xmath27 to denote the ratio between stellar mass and luminosity in the restframe @xmath28-band ; where the discussion is generic to all ( optical and nir ) bands , we will drop the subscript for convenience . in all cases , the @xmath29 in @xmath27 should be understood as referring to the absolute luminosity of the galaxy , _",
    "i.e. _ , without correction for internal dust extinction .",
    "we thus consider effective , and not intrinsic stellar mass - to - light ratios . unless explicitly stated otherwise , quantitative values of @xmath27s are given using units of @xmath29 equivalent to an ab magnitude of 0 ( rather than , say , @xmath30 ) .",

    "our motivation for presenting these plots is twofold .",
    "first , the figures presented in this section illustrate the distribution of derived parameter values for all @xmath134 gama galaxies with @xmath55 and @xmath54 ( defined in [ ch : specdata ] ) .",
    "the different panels in each figure show the 2d - projected logarithmic data density in small cells ; the same colour - scale is used for all panels in all of figures [ fig : bestfit][fig : bfvsml ] .",
    "note that by showing the logarithmic data density , we are visually emphasising the more sparsely populated regions of parameter space .",
    "second , we use these figures to illustrate the differences between sp parameter estimates based on bayesian statistics , and those derived using more traditional , frequentist statistics . as described above , bayesian statistics focuses on the most likely state of affairs given the observation , @xmath135 .",
    "bayesian estimators can be , both in principle and in practice , significantly different to frequentist estimators , which set out to identify the set of model parameters that is most easily able to explain the observations ; _ i.e. _ , to maximise @xmath136 . to make plain the differences between these two parameter estimates",
    ", we will compare the bayesian ` most likely ' estimator as defined by equation ( [ eq : margin ] ) to a more traditional ` best fit ' value derived via maximum likelihood .",
    "note that when deriving the frequentist ` best fit ' values , we have applied our priors through weighting of the value of @xmath128 for each template ; that is , the ` best fit ' value is that associated with the template @xmath109 which has the highest value of @xmath137 .    the distribution of these ` best fit ' sp parameters are shown in * figure [ fig : bestfit ] * , as a function of stellar mass , @xmath13 and sp age , @xmath73 .",
    "it is immediately obvious from this figure how our use of a semi - regular grid of sp parameters to construct the spl leads directly to strong quantisation in the ` best fit ' values of @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , and @xmath82 .",
    "what is more worrying , however , is that there is also a mild discretisation in the inferred values of @xmath18 , seen in the bottom - lefthand panel of figure [ fig : bestfit ] as a subtle striping .",
    "this is despite the fact that the spl samples a much more nearly continuous range of @xmath18s than @xmath73s , @xmath84s , or @xmath74s .    to explain the origin of this effect , let us return to figure [ fig : ugri ] . for a given galaxy , there will be a large number of templates that will be consistent with the observed @xmath20 photometry .",
    "to the extent that a small perturbation in the observed photometry can have a large impact on the inferred sp parameter values , there is a degree of randomness in the selection of the ` best fit ' solution from within the error ellipse .",
    "this means that values of @xmath18 , @xmath3 , etc .  that are ` over - represented ' within the spl",
    "will be more commonly selected as ` best fits ' .",
    "note that this problem of discretisation in @xmath4 is therefore _ not _ a sign of insufficiently fine sampling of the spl parameter space : this problem arises where there very many , not very few , templates that are consistent with a given galaxy s observed colours .",
    "figure [ fig : bestfit ] should be compared to * figure [ fig : fitdists ] * , in which we show the distribution of the bayesian ` most likely ' parameter values .",
    "consider again figure [ fig : ugri ] : whereas the ` best fit ' value is the one nearest the centre of the error ellipse for any given galaxy , the bayesian value is found by taking a probability - weighted mean of all values around the observed data point .",
    "the process of bayesian marginalisation can thus be thought of as using the spl templates to discretely sample a continuous parameter distribution , after effectively smoothing on a scale commensurate with the observational uncertainties .",
    "this largely mitigates the discretisation in @xmath73 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74as well as in @xmath18that comes from using a fixed grid of parameter values to define the spl .    .",
    "it is immediately obvious how the use of a semi - regular grid of sp parameter values within our spl produces strong discretisation in @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , and @xmath82 . in the lower - left panel ,",
    "however , it can be seen that there is some quantisation in @xmath18 , even though the distribution of @xmath18s in the spl is more nearly continuous . as described in [ ch : diagnostics ] , this form of discretisation arises where there are strong degeneracies in the sps fit that can not be properly accounted for using a frequentist ` best fit ' approach .",
    "[ fig : bestfit],width=287 ]    , @xmath84 , and @xmath82 shown .",
    "the observed relations between these parameters shows that information about the process of galaxy formation and evolution can be extracted from galaxies seds . from an algorithmic point of view",
    ", the most important point to take from this plot is that by using a bayesian approach , we are able for the most part to avoid ` discretisation ' errors ( _ i.e. _ , preferred parameter values ) associated with the use of a discrete grid of parameter values ( _ cf . _  figure [ fig : bestfit ] ) .",
    "further , note that particularly for @xmath73 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 , these distributions are qualitatively different to those in figure [ fig : bestfit ] .",
    "[ fig : fitdists],width=287 ]    that said , this only works where several different parameter combinations provide an acceptable description of the data .",
    "if one particular template is strongly preferred ",
    "if the observational uncertainties in a galaxy s sed are comparable to or less than the differences between the seds of different templates  then our approach reverts to a ` best fit ' , and we will again suffer from artificial quantisation in the fit parameters . for the same reasons ,",
    "the formal uncertainty on the sp parameters will be artificially small in this case .",
    "note that , somewhat perversely , this problem will become _ worse _ with increasing signal  to  noise .",
    "( see also * ? ? ? * but note , too , that the inclusion of a moderate ",
    "uncertainty in the observed seds works to protect against  single template",
    " fits . ) in this sense , and in contrast to the quantisation in the ` best fit ' values discussed above , quantisation in the bayesian ` most likely ' values does indicate inadequately fine sampling of the spl parameter space .",
    "we have chosen our parameter grids with this limitation in mind ; in particular , we have found that a rather fine sampling in the @xmath82 dimension is required to avoid strong quantisation .",
    "although our spl templates span a semi - regular grid in each of @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , and @xmath82 , the observed distribution in these parameters is anything but uniform .",
    "there is nothing in the calculation to preclude solutions with , for example , young ages and low metallicities .",
    "the fact that these regions of parameter space are sparsely- or un - populated shows that there are few or no galaxies with optical seds that are consistent with these properties .",
    "figure [ fig : fitdists ] thus illustrates the mundane or crucial ( depending on one s perspective ) fact that the derived sp parameters do indeed encode information about the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is particularly striking that there appears to be a rather tight and ` bimodal ' relation between @xmath73 and @xmath84 : there is a population of galaxies that are best fit by very long and nearly continuous sfhs ( @xmath138 gyr ) , and another with @xmath139 310 .",
    "there are virtually no galaxies inferred to have @xmath140 .",
    "the inferred distribution of parameter values is significant in terms of our assumed priors : it is clear that the derived parameter distributions do not follow our assumed priors ( see also figure [ fig : colourrel ] ) .",
    "but this is not to say that the precise values are not more subtly affected by our particular choice of priors . in particular",
    ", the local slope of the priors on the scale of the formally derived uncertainties might act to skew the posterior pdf ( see also appendix [ ch : mocks ] ) . in principle , it is possible to use the observed parameter distributions to derive new , astrophysically motivated priors . then",
    ", if this were to significantly alter the observed parameter distribution , the process could be iterated until convergence .",
    "such an exercise is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "next , in * figure [ fig : errors ] * , we show the distribution of inferred uncertainties in each of the parameters shown in figure [ fig : fitdists ] . as in figure",
    "[ fig : fitdists ] , there is some structure apparent in these distributions : the uncertainties in some derived properties are different for galaxies with different kinds of stellar populations . as a simple example , galaxies with @xmath141 have considerably larger uncertainties in @xmath84 , as information about the sfh is washed out with the deaths of shorter - lived stars . in connection to the discretisation problem ,",
    "the very young galaxies ( seen in figure [ fig : fitdists ] to suffer from discretisation in the values of @xmath74 ) also have low formal values for @xmath142 and/or @xmath143 .",
    "but it is worth noting that in comparison to the uncertainties in other sp parameters , @xmath144 is more nearly constant across the population ( this is perhaps more clearly apparent in figure [ fig : bfvsml ] , described immediately below ) .",
    "our last task for this section is to directly compare the frequentist ` best fit ' and bayesian ` most likely ' sp values ; this comparison is shown in * figure [ fig : bfvsml ] * . in each panel of this figure , the ` @xmath145 ' plotted on the @xmath146 axis should be understood as being the ` best fit'-minus-`most likely ' value ; these are plotted as a function of the bayesian estimator . within each panel ,",
    "the dashed white curves show the median @xmath147 uncertainty in the @xmath146-axis quantity , derived in the bayesian way , and computed in narrow bins of the @xmath148-axis quantity .",
    "these curves can thus be taken to indicate the formal consistency between the best fit and most likely parameter values .    in practice",
    ", there is an appreciable systematic difference between the frequentist and bayesian parameter estimates . in general",
    ", we find that traditional , frequentist estimates are slightly older ( by @xmath149 dex ) , less dusty ( by @xmath150 mag ) , and more massive ( by @xmath151 dex ) than the bayesian values . in comparison to the formal uncertainties , these systematic differences are at the 0.50.7@xmath6 level ; this is despite the fact that the ` best fit ' value is within 1.5@xmath6 of the ` most likely ' value for 99 % of objects . and",
    "again , we stress that , formally , the bayesian estimator is the correct value to use",
    ".    , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 is different for different stellar populations . the crucial point to be made from this figure , however , is that the formal uncertainty in @xmath4 is @xmath21 dex for the vast majority of galaxies , with essentially no dependence on the uncertainties in other parameter values .",
    "[ fig : errors],width=294 ]        as a final aside for this section , we note that the importance of bayesian analysis has been recognised in the context of photometric redshift evaluation ( a problem which is very closely linked to sps fitting ) by a number of authors , including @xcite and @xcite . while most of the sps fitting results for sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "said another way , gama probes roughly twice the range of lookback times of sdss .",

    "figure [ fig : residuals ] should be compared to figure [ fig : simresiduals ] in appendix [ ch : mocks ] .",

    "inasmuch as they can inform our expectations for the real data , the results of these numerical experiments ( shown in figure [ fig : simresiduals ] ) can help interpret the offsets seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] .    in figure",

    ", we see that our sps fits provide a reasonably good description of the observed @xmath20 seds of real gama galaxies .",
    "the fit residuals are qualitatively and quantitatively similar when using each of the three different ssp models to construct the spl .",
    "the median offset in each of the @xmath183-bands is @xmath184 ( @xmath1850.10 , @xmath1850.00 , + 0.01 , + 0.02 , @xmath1850.03 ) mag . in terms of the formal uncertainties from the fits , the median offsets are at the level of @xmath184 ( @xmath1850.3 , @xmath1850.0 , + 0.2 , + 0.5 , @xmath1850.5)@xmath6 .",
    "the systematic biases in the fit photometry are thus weakly significant , but , at least for the @xmath186-bands , well within the imposed error floor of 0.05 mag .",
    "how does this compare to what is seen for the mocks in figures [ fig : simresiduals ] ?",
    "we find qualitatively similar offsets when fitting to the mock @xmath20 photometry .",
    "more specifically , we see a similar ` curvature ' in the residuals , with slight excesses in the fit values for the @xmath187- and @xmath101-band photometry , and the @xmath131- band photometry being very slightly too faint . it is true that , quantitatively , the offsets seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] are about twice as large as we might expect based on our numerical experiments ( @xmath188 for the real data , as opposed to @xmath189 for the mocks ) .",
    "but even so , the fact that we see similar residuals when fitting to the mocks shows that such residuals are to be expected , even in the ideal case where both the spl and photometry are perfect .",
    "we do not , therefore , consider the mild systematic offsets between the fit and observed photometry as evidence for major problems in the @xmath20 fits .",

    ", there is no reason to suspect that we should be unable to reproduce the observed optical  to  nir sed shapes of real galaxies .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : simresiduals ] , the fits to the mock @xmath64 seds are near perfect .",
    "each of the issues highlighted above point to inconsistencies between the optical  to  nir colours of our spl models on the one hand , and of real galaxies on the other .",
    "further , the fact that the models fail to satisfactorily describe the nir data immediately calls into question the reliability of parameter estimates derived from fits to the full optical - to - nir photometry .",

    "again , based on our experiences with the mock catalogues described in appendix [ ch : mocks ] , we have no reasons to expect these sort of discrepancies : for the mocks , we are able to recover the input sp parameters with virtually no systematic bias using either the optical  only or optical  plus  nir seds ( see figure [ fig : reliable ] ) .    in each case , based on the formal uncertainties from the 5-band fits , the median significance of the offset in the sp parameter estimates is @xmath209 . for each of these quantities ,",

    "( using the @xcite models , we find a similar fraction ; using the @xcite models , this fraction goes up to 3040 % . )",
    "this shows that the residuals seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] are more than merely a cosmetic problem  they are symptomatic of inconsistencies between the fits with and without the inclusion of the nir .    to make plain the importance of these systematic offsets , consider the fact that there are large and statistically significant differences in the @xmath3 colours inferred from the 9-band and 5-band fits .",
    "the median values inferred from the fits with the nir included are 0.10 mag bluer than those based on the optical alone . in comparison to the formal uncertainties in the 5-band derived values of @xmath3 ,",
    "this amounts to an inconsistency at the @xmath211 level . and",
    "this is despite the fact that the nir data _ by definition _ contain no information about @xmath3 .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : residuals ] , it is clear that the 5-band fits are a more reliable means of inferring a restframe @xmath3 colour : for the 9-band fits , the differential offset between the @xmath212 and @xmath202 bands is @xmath213 mag ; for the 5-band fits , the differential offset is @xmath214 mag .    said another way , because the 9-band fits have the wrong sed shape , they can not be used to infer a restframe colour .",
    "but the same is true of any other derived property  simply put , _ if the models can not fit the data , they can not be used to interpret them .",
    "_      one possible explanation for the large residuals seen in figure [ fig : optnir ] is problems with the @xcite ssp models . in particular , one might worry that these are related to the nir contributions of tp - agb stars . in this context , let us begin by noting that if this were to be the source of the problems that we are seeing , then we would expect the optical  only fits to underpredict the ` true ' nir fluxes , particularly for the @xcite models .",

    "it is clear from figure [ fig : bc03m05 ] that there are systematic differences between the models , particularly ( and as expected ) for @xmath215@xmath216 gyr .",

    "using only the optical data , the _",

    "that is , when using optical data only , these famously ` disagreeing ' models yield completely consistent results .",
    "this is in marked contrast to a number of results emphasising the importance of differences in the modelling of tp - agb stars in the @xcite and @xcite models when nir data are used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of ` random ' differences ,",
    "the inferred values of @xmath13 based on the two sets of models agree to within @xmath217 dex ( a factor of 2 ) for 99 % of galaxies .",
    "we can treat the 15/85 percentile points of the distribution of the  @xmath145 s as indicative of the 1@xmath6 random ` error ' associated with the choice of ssp model . for @xmath18 ,",
    "this ` error ' is @xmath218 dex .",
    "that is , when using only optical data , the sp parameter estimates are not significantly model dependent .",
    "when we include the nir data in the fits , the agreement between the sp values inferred using the two different sets of ssp models is not as good .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath13 using the @xcite or @xcite models agree to within @xmath219 dex ( a factor of 3 ) for 99 % of galaxies ; the 1@xmath6 random ` error ' in @xmath13 is @xmath220 dex .",
    "while the inferred values of @xmath18 agree reasonably well , the differences in the other inferred stellar population parameters @xmath82 , @xmath74 , and especially @xmath208are larger . for @xmath208 , the @xmath221 ` error ' is @xmath222 dex ; this should be compared to the formal uncertainty in @xmath208 of @xmath190 dex .",
    "thus we see that the ` error ' in sp parameter estimates associated with the choice of model becomes comparable to the formal uncertainties when , and only when , nir data is included in the fit .      what can have possibly gone wrong in the fits to the nir data ? there are ( at least ) three potential explanations for our inability to obtain a good description of the optical ",
    "nir sed shapes of gama galaxies using the models in our spl .",
    "the first is problems in the data .",
    "the second is problems in the stellar evolution models used to derive the ssp spectra that form the basis of our template library .",
    "the third is problems in how we have used these ssp spectra to construct the csps that comprise our spl .",
    "we can not unambiguously exclude the possibility of errors in , for example , the basic photometric calibration of the nir imaging data . in this context",
    ", we highlight the qualitative difference in our ability to use optical data to predict nir fluxes for the real gama galaxies on the one hand , and for mock galaxies on the other .",
    "in particular , the sharp discontinuity in the residuals between the @xmath101- and @xmath203-bands for the real galaxies would seem to suggest a large inconsistency between these two bands at the level of @xmath223@xmath224 mag .    as described in [ ch : photdata ] , gama has received the nir data fully reduced and calibrated . in order to ensure that there are not problems in our nir photometric methods ( which are not different from those in the optical )",
    ", we have verified that there are no large systematic offsets between our photometry and that produced by casu .",
    "this would suggest that any inconsistencies would really have to be in the imaging data themselves .",
    "the accuracy of the ukirt wfcam data calibration has been investigated by @xcite through comparison to sources from the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite : they argue that the absolute calibrations of the @xmath203- and @xmath225-band are good to @xmath226 and @xmath227 % , respectively . * ? ? ? * taken at face value , this argues against there being such large inconsistencies in the photometry .    in light of the fact that we have not been directly involved in the reduction or calibration of these data , and with the anticipated availability of the considerably deeper vista - viking nir imaging in the near future",
    ", we will not investigate this further here .      from what we have already seen",
    ", we can exclude errors in the ssp models as a likely candidate .",
    "we have shown in figure [ fig : residuals ] that _ none _ of the @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite models provides a good description of the full optical - to - nir seds of real galaxies  these models all show qualitatively and quantitatively similar fit residuals . taken together , the results in figures [ fig : optnir ] and [ fig : bc03m05 ] show that ( for the same data ) the sp parameters derived using different models show small systematic differences , while at the same time ( for any given set of ssp models ) there is a large systematic difference between the values derived with or without the nir data .",
    "this is not to say that the models are perfect , but the offsets seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] would appear to be larger than can be explained by uncertainties inherent in the ssp models themselves.-2      this leaves the third possibility that the assumptions that we have made in constructing our spl are overly simplistic , in the sense that they do not faithfully describe or encapsulate the true mix of sps found in real galaxies .",
    "we defer discussion of this possibility to [ ch : future ] . for now , however , we stress that the present spl _ does _ seem to be capable of describing the optical sed shapes of real galaxies .",
    "we have now outlined three reasons to suspect that , at least in our case , sp parameter estimates based only on optical photometry are more robust than if we were to include the nir data :    1 .",
    "regardless of which set of ssp models we use , we see much larger than expected residuals in the sed fits when the nir data are included .",
    "if the models do not provide a good description of the data , then we can not confidently use them to infer galaxies sp properties .",
    "the consistency between the sp parameter estimates derived with or without the inclusion of the nir data is poor . for a sizeable fraction of gama galaxies ( @xmath228 % ) , the sp parameter values inferred from fits to the optical  plus ",
    "nir seds are statistically inconsistent ( at the @xmath229 level ) with those based on the optical alone .",
    "when using different models to construct the spl templates , the agreement between the derived sp parameters is very good when the nir data are excluded , but considerably worse when the nir data are included .",
    "that is , the fit results become significantly model - dependent when , and only when , we try to include the nir data .    for these reasons , and for the time being , we choose not to use the nir data when deriving the stellar mass estimates .",
    "this begs the question as to how accurately @xmath18 can be constrained based on optical data alone , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "as we have said at the beginning of [ ch : nir ] , conventional wisdom says that nir data provides a better estimate of stellar mass . our conclusion in [ ch : nir ] ,",
    "however , is that we are unable to satisfactorily incorporate the nir data into the sps calculation . with this as our motivation , we will now look at how well @xmath18 can be constrained on the basis of optical data alone . in particular , we want to know whether or to what extent the accuracy of our stellar mass estimates is compromised by our decision to ignore the nir data .",
    "part of the rationale behind the idea that the nir provides a better estimate of @xmath18 is that galaxies show less variation in their nir @xmath18s than they do in the optical .",

    "finally , the colour - graded lines connect models with the same @xmath73 and @xmath84 , but different metallicities . in this way , each panel shows a 2d projection of the 3d ( @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 ) grid of spl templates .",
    "note that we only show zero - dust models in this figure ; the dust - extinction vector is shown in the lower - right corner of each panel .",
    "each row of figure [ fig : moverls ] shows the mass  to  light ratio in different bands ( @xmath232 , from top to bottom ) .",
    "let us look first at the first column , in which we plot each of these @xmath18s as a function of time . for fixed @xmath74 and @xmath84 , and particularly for @xmath233 gyr , it is true that the nir @xmath18 varies less with @xmath73 than does the optical @xmath18but not by all that much . for the ssp models ,",
    "the total variation in @xmath18 between 2 and 10 gyr is @xmath234 dex in the @xmath187 band , compared to @xmath235 dex in the @xmath202-band , and @xmath236 dex in the @xmath204- and @xmath237-bands .",
    "similarly , it is also true that at fixed @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the spread in @xmath18s for different @xmath84s is slightly smaller for longer wavelengths : the total variation goes from @xmath234 dex in the @xmath212-band to @xmath238 dex in the @xmath202-band , to @xmath12 dex in the @xmath204- and @xmath237-bands .",

    "* ) , it seems that the most important thing is to use a band that is redder than the 4000   and balmer breaks  the range in @xmath4 is not all that much greater than that in @xmath239 or @xmath240 .",

    "[ fig : moverls ] , width=294 ]      in what we have said so far in this section , we have completely ignored dust .",
    "this may have seemed like a very important oversight , so let us now address this issue .",
    "the dust vector in @xmath3@xmath4 space is ( @xmath247 ) = ( 0.19 , 0.11 ) @xmath248 .",
    "compare this to the empirical @xmath3@xmath4 relation for gama galaxies , which , as we show in [ ch : colourrel ] below , has a slope of 0.73 . because these two vectors are roughly aligned",
    ", the first order effect of dust obscuration is merely to shift galaxies along the @xmath3@xmath4 relation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the accuracy of @xmath3-derived estimates of @xmath4 are not sensitive to a galaxy s precise dust content",
    ". said another way , although there may be large uncertainties in @xmath82 , this does not necessarily imply that there will also be large uncertainties in @xmath4 .",
    "to see this clearly , imagine that we were only to use zero - dust models in our spl , and take the example of a galaxy that in reality has @xmath249 mag . in comparison to the zero - dust spl model with the same @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 ,",
    "this dusty galaxy s @xmath3 colour becomes 0.19 mag redder , and its absolute luminosity drops by 0.11 dex ; the effective @xmath4 is thus increased by the same amount .",
    "( recall that @xmath244 denotes the effective absolute luminosity _ without _ correction for internal dust obscuration , rather than the intrinsic luminosity produced by all stars . ) now , using the slope of the @xmath3@xmath4 relation , the inferred value of @xmath4 for the @xmath249 mag galaxy will be @xmath250 dex higher than it would be for the same galaxy with no dust .",
    "that is , in this simple thought experiment , the error in the value of the effective @xmath4 implied by @xmath3 would be @xmath251 dex , even though we would be using completely the wrong kind of sps model to ` fit ' the observed galaxy .",
    "note that this argument holds only to the extent that dust can be accurately modelled using a single dust vector ; _ i.e._a single screen approximation . using the @xcite attenuation curve , which is a single screen approximation to a fractal dust distribution ,",
    "does not produce a large change in the derived values of @xmath18 .",
    "using the model of @xcite and @xcite , @xcite show how variations in both viewing angle and bulge  to  disk ratio can produce a spread in the color@xmath18 dust vectors .",
    "these results suggest that in some cases , dust geometry may have a significant effect on the colour - inferred value of @xmath18 , at the level of @xmath252 .",
    "one avenue for further investigation of the effects of dust geometry is through detailed radiative transfer modelling for galaxies whose geometries can be accurately constrained .",
    "while this is clearly impractical for large galaxy samples , an alternative would be to construct spatially resolved mass maps ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , using a single - screen approximation for each pixel individually .            just as @xmath3 can be used to estimate @xmath4 without being strongly sensitive to dust , variations in each of age , sfh , and metallicity do not have a large impact on @xmath3-inferred estimates of @xmath4 .",
    "this is demonstrated in * figure [ fig : gimodels ] * , in which we use our spl models to show how variations in any one of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , or @xmath74 shift galaxies in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane .",
    "we do this as follows : for an individual model , we ask how great a change in any one of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , or @xmath74 ( while holding the other two parameters fixed ) is required to change @xmath3 by 0.05 mag ; we then look at the corresponding change in @xmath4 that comes with this variation .",
    "in other words , we are looking at how uncertainties in each of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 affect the accuracy of @xmath3inferred estimates of @xmath4 .",

    "focussing on each set of vectors individually , it can be seen that for the bulk of the models , the effect of independent variations in any of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , or @xmath74 is to move the model point more or less parallel to the main cloud .",
    "note , too , that closer to the centre of the main cloud , the three separate vectors tend to come into closer alignment .",
    "to first order , then , variations in any one of these quantities simply shift galaxies along the main @xmath3@xmath4 relation . by the same argument presented above in regard to dust",

    "figure [ fig : gimodels ] thus shows that , uncertainties in any of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 do not produce large errors in the value of @xmath4 inferred from the @xmath3 colour .",
    "considering the combined effect of variations in all three of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 , the robustness of @xmath3derived estimates of @xmath4 is even greater .",
    "the black vectors in this plot show the net variation in @xmath4 allowing for the uncertainties in all of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath74 that come with an observational uncertainty of @xmath253 . notice how closely aligned these vectors are with the empirical @xmath3@xmath4 relation for real galaxies .",
    "this shows that while there may well be a relatively large range of models with different values of @xmath73 , @xmath84 , and/or @xmath74 that are consistent with the observed value of @xmath3 for any given galaxy , because all of these models will follow more or less the same relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the spread of @xmath4s among these models will still be relatively low .",
    "that is , through a coincidence of dust and sp evolution physics , _ the dust  age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy actually helps in the estimate of _",
    "@xmath4 ( see also , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , as a corollary to this statement , because the estimated value of @xmath4 does not depend strongly on the accuracy of the inferred values of @xmath75 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , or @xmath82 , it is not necessary to model these aspects of the spl models exactly .",
    "the last commonly - cited bugbear of stellar mass estimation is the effect of ` secondary ' populations in general , and of bursts in particular , on the inferred value of @xmath18 . to explore this issue ,",
    "consider the case of a combination of two sps with ( @xmath75 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 ) = ( 10 gyr , 0.5 gyr , @xmath74@xmath107 ) and ( 0.5 gyr , 30 myr , @xmath74@xmath107 ) ; _ i.e. _ , an old and passive sp and a very young and star forming sp .",
    "these two individual sps are highlighted in the fourth panel of figure [ fig : gimodels ] .",
    "now let us combine these two sps in varying amounts .",
    "the track connecting these two points show where the combined sp would lie in the @xmath4@xmath3 plane .",
    "the large points highlight the cases where the mass of the burst component is @xmath254 , @xmath255 , ... , @xmath256 times the mass of the old component .    we again see that the @xmath4@xmath3 relation is largely preserved . in particular , the effect of small bursts ( @xmath257 ) on the @xmath4@xmath3 colour relation is very slight .",
    "at least for the specific case that we have chosen to illustrate , we see that if a very old galaxy were to experience a modest burst ( @xmath258 % ) , then this will shift the galaxy along the edge of the main cloud .",
    "the greatest concern is a largely star - forming galaxy with a sizeable underlying population of very old stars ( @xmath259 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 can shift by up to 0.5 dex with only a small change in colour ; @xmath260 .",
    "it is thus clear from this panel that secondary stellar populations in general , and those with @xmath261 in particular , are better able to shift galaxies away from the main @xmath4@xmath3 relation than are variations in any or all of @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , or @xmath82 within one of our smooth and exponential csps .",
    "that said , we stress this specific example represents something of an extreme case : the two separate sps we have chosen are at opposite ends of the sp values that we find for real galaxies , and the problem is only significant where the two populations are comparable in mass .",
    "furthermore , even for this extreme example , note that the combined sp still lies within the main cloud of sps within our spl .",
    "the claim that @xmath4 can be estimated to within a factor of @xmath19 based on the @xmath3 colour alone is true even for galaxies with relatively complex sfhs .",
    "so far in this section , our discussion has been restricted to the range of @xmath18s and colours spanned by the models in our spl , and has thus focussed on the theoretical relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in this sense",
    ", our conversation has been completely generic  at least insofar as the sp models we have used provide an accurate description of the stellar content of real galaxies .",
    "let us now turn to * figure [ fig : colourrel ] * , and consider how well @xmath3 can be used to estimate @xmath4 in practice . in this figure ,",
    "the grey - scale contours show the prior - weighted distribution on @xmath4 for the models , again in bins of @xmath3 , as the grey - scale contours : the darkest line shows the median prior - weighted value ; the greyscale shows the equivalent of the @xmath219 , 1.0 , ... , 3.0 @xmath6 percentiles .",
    "this figure also shows the empirical relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 that we infer for real gama galaxies , based on our @xmath20 sps fits .",
    "the data themselves are shown as the blue points .    consider for a moment what would happen if we were to have only ( restframe ) @xmath212- and @xmath202-band photometry for a real galaxy .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath4 would just be the mean value of all models in our spl with a similar colour ( weighted both by the consistency between the observed and model photometry , and the prior probability of that model ) .",
    "further , for a given @xmath3 , the inferred uncertainty in @xmath4 would simply reflect the prior - weighted range of values spanned by models of the same colour .",
    "that is , we would expect to ` recover ' the prior - weighted distribution shown as the grey contours in figure [ fig : colourrel ] .",
    "this is not what we see for the real galaxies : there are clear differences between the form of and scatter around the relations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the models on the one hand , and for the data on the other . particularly for intermediate colours , the median value of @xmath4 is considerably lower than the probability - weighted mean of the models .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath187- , @xmath264 , and @xmath101-band data do provide additional information concerning @xmath4 that can not be gleaned from @xmath3 alone .- band photometry did not provide additional sp information , then the observed relation would be strongly dependent on the specific priors used ; particularly the assumed prior on @xmath84 . ]",
    "further , the effect of this additional information is to significantly _ reduce _ the observed scatter in the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the red points in figure [ fig : colourrel ] show the median values of @xmath4 for gama galaxies in narrow bins of @xmath3 .",
    "the error bars on these points show the mean values of the formal 1@xmath6 upper and lower limit on @xmath4 in each bin ; these error bars thus show the intrinsic , astrophysical scatter in the relation convolved with the formal , observational uncertainties . even considering the formal uncertainties for individual galaxies , the scatter around the mean colour@xmath4 relation is considerably lower than what would expected from the models alone : quantitatively , the scatter in @xmath4 is constrained to being @xmath265 dex for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that , _ the apparent tightness of the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is not a mere consequence of the central limit theorem_.    in other words , the precise form of the empirical relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 encodes information about the distributions of sps among real galaxies .",
    "both the linearity and tightness of the observed relation are therefore fortuitous coincidences of the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "fitting the empirical relation for gama galaxies , we find : @xmath266 ( to convert @xmath244 from our preferred ab - centric units to solar units , note that the absolute ab magnitude of the sun in the @xmath202-band is @xmath267 . )",
    "this fit is shown in figure [ fig : colourrel ] as the solid red line . in the fitting , we have fully accounted for the covariant errors in the derived values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; the mean error ellipse is shown in the lower - right corner of this panel . rearranging equation [ eq : colourrel",

    "the @xcite relation has been derived for galaxies from the sdss edr , and should thus be compared to our empirical relation .",

    "the @xcite relation has been obtained by marginalising over the models in their spl in bins of @xmath3 .",
    "this relation thus can not be considered to be ` empirical ' , and should be compared to the prior - weighted median for our spl , shown as the heavier grey line .",
    "the significant systematic differences between these relations underscore the importance of ensuring that any cross - survey comparisons are based on a comparable mass scale .",
    "[ fig : giothers],width=309 ]    in * figure [ fig : giothers ] * , we compare our empirically calibrated @xmath4@xmath3 relation to two other recent works . from the outset ,",
    "let us stress that these relations are _ not _ directly comparable , in the sense that they have been derived in very different ways , and therefore should be interpreted as having rather different meanings .",
    "first , the dashed blue line shows the relation given by @xcite , which has been derived from least - squares sed fitting to @xmath20 seds for galaxies from the sdss early data release ( edr * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with @xmath237-band photometry from 2mass @xcite , and using pegase @xcite ssp models as the basis of the spl .",
    "we have scaled the @xcite relation down by 0.093 dex to account for their use of a ` diet salpeter ' rather than @xcite imf .",
    "most importantly , @xcite explicitly attempt to account for evolution between the epoch of observation and the present day by running forward the implied sfh to @xmath271 . with that caveat ,",
    "the @xcite relation is derived from fits to the observed relation between @xmath18 and colour for real galaxies in a similar way as in this work , and so can be compared to our relation , shown in figure [ fig : giothers ] as the solid red line .",
    "second , the solid blue line shows the relation derived by @xcite , which is based on a monte carlo realised spl modelled after @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , including secondary sf bursts ) , with a sophisticated treatment of dust extinction using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the relation shown has been derived by marginalising over all spl models in bins of @xmath3 .",
    "the @xcite relation should therefore be compared to the heavier gray line in figure [ fig : giothers ] , which shows the prior - weighted median value of @xmath4 , computed in bins of @xmath3 , for our spl .",
    "that said , there is still one important caveat : @xcite have marginalised over their dust priors , whereas the gray line in figure [ fig : giothers ] is based only on the zero - dust models in our spl .",
    "note that the precise form of the @xcite line is determined almost entirely by their assumed priors ( _ i.e. _ , the relative weighting given to the different models in their spl ) ; no observational data has been used to derive this relation .    the reader may be forgiven for being startled by the apparently poor agreement between these relations in the first instance , and then equally by the subtleties in their meanings .",
    "the point to take from this comparison is simply that there are important systematic differences between each of these mass determinations .",
    "( although , again , we stress that we have shown our @xmath4 estimates to be in excellent agreement with the well - tested and widely used sdss values . )",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : giothers ] that comparing results based on different mass determination methods would not be fair , or at best , would be misleading .",
    "the utility of these relations is therefore primarily that they provide a means for simply and transparently reproducing the results of more sophisticated calculations , ` warts and all ' ; _ i.e. _ , including any and all systematics .",
    "the derived relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 thus provides a solid basis for comparison between results from gama ( and , by extension , sdss ) , and from other survey projects .",
    "in this penultimate section , we look at how our sp parameter estimates might be improved for future gama catalogues . first , in [ ch",
    ": nirvalue ] , we look at what might be gained by successfully integrating nir data into our sps calculations . then , in light of our present difficulties in incorporating the available nir data , in [ ch : future ] , we explore potential avenues for improving on the present sp parameter estimates . in particular , we argue that any future improvements in our sps calculations will require a new conceptual framework .",
    "let us now consider what additional information may be provided by the inclusion of nir data , or , conversely , what we have sacrificed by excluding the available nir data for the present catalogue of stellar masses and sp parameters .",
    "our discussion of this question is based on * figure [ fig : moverls2]*. as in figure [ fig : moverls ] , these panels show the variation in @xmath18 at different wavelengths for our spl .",
    "the lefthand panels show @xmath18 as a function of @xmath3 colour ; the righthand panels show the same as a function of @xmath272 colour . using this figure ,",
    "then , we can compare the information encoded in optical  minus  optical and optical  minus  nir colours .",
    "figure [ fig : moverls2 ] shows that most of the additional information encoded within optical  to  nir colours is concerning metallicity : the fact that each of the single - metallicity surfaces are well separated in the righthand panels shows that the different metallicity models can be easily distinguished by their @xmath272 colours . while the single - age metallicity surfaces are well - separated , however , the fact that each of these surfaces spans a narrower range of @xmath272 colours than @xmath3 colours shows that both @xmath75 and @xmath84 are better constrained by @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the inclusion of nir data will not necessarily lead to tighter constraints on galaxies individual sfhs .",
    "further , by the same argument that we have used in [ ch : moverls ] and [ ch : gimodels ] , it is immediately clear from figure [ fig : moverls2 ] that the @xmath272 colour encodes virtually _ no _ information directly pertaining to @xmath18 : the range of @xmath18 within our spl is nearly constant as a function of @xmath272 . to be sure",
    ", optical  to  nir sed shape is a powerful means of breaking degeneracies associated with metallicity , but _ this has very little bearing on the inferred value of @xmath4_.    in this way , figure [ fig : moverls2 ] offers a means of understanding the results of the numerical experiments presented in appendix [ ch : mocks ] . in this appendix , we find that the principal gain that comes with the inclusion of the nir is in our ability to recover the known values of @xmath74 for the mock galaxies .",
    "although the inclusion of nir data has little to no effect on our ability to recover @xmath73 or @xmath84 individually , our ability to recover @xmath208 is improved ( from @xmath273 % to @xmath274 % ) with the inclusion of the nir .",
    "that is , while nir data do help to break the degeneracy between metallicity and luminosity - weighted mean stellar age , it does not help to constrain galaxies precise sfhs .",
    "we also find that including the nir data has little effect on our ability to recover the known values of @xmath18 for synthetic galaxies : we are able to recover the known values of @xmath18 to within @xmath275 and @xmath276 dex with and without the inclusion of nir data , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that the robustness and reliability of our stellar mass estimates will not necessarily be improved simply by folding the nir data into the sps calculations  or , said another way , our decision to exclude the nir data for the current catalogue does not necessarily have a large adverse effect on the quality of our stellar mass estimates .     as a function of restframe @xmath3 and @xmath272 colour for models in our spl. all symbols and their meanings are as in the directly comparable figure [ fig : moverls ] .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3 , optical  minus  nir colours contain virtually no information directly pertaining to @xmath22 , or to age .",
    "instead , the optical  to  nir colour is sensitive primarily to variations in dust and metallicity . while the inclusion of nir data into the sps fitting calculation may in principle",
    "lead to tighter constraints on @xmath73 , @xmath84 , @xmath74 , and @xmath82 , it will have little to no impact on the accuracy of our @xmath18 estimates .",
    "[ fig : moverls2 ] , width=294 ]      in [ ch : badnir ] , we have suggested that our problems in satisfactorily incorporating the available nir data into the sps calculation may reflect that our present spl is inadequate to the task of describing galaxies full optical  to  nir sed shapes . in this section , with an eye towards the availability of the much deeper vst - kids and vista - viking optical and nir imaging in the near future , we discuss possible avenues for deriving improved sp parameter constraints .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the first instance in what kinds of expansions of our spl are likely to have the greatest impact on our sps calculation ; secondarily to this , we want to know whether and what modifications to our sps algorithm will be required to fully exploit these high quality data .",
    "our discussion is based on * figure [ fig : badnir ] * , in which we show colour - colour diagrams for two heavily populated redshift intervals in the gama sample .",
    "the coloured lines in figure [ fig : badnir ] show the evolutionary tracks for models in our spl with different values of @xmath84 and @xmath74 .",
    "each track is colour - coded according to its metallicity .",
    "for clarity , we only show the models with zero dust ; the @xmath249 dust vector is shown at the bottom right of each panel .",
    "these tracks should be compared to the actual observations , which are shown as the black points .",
    "based on this figure , let us now consider how our ability to fit the optical  to  nir seds of real galaxies might change with an expanded spl template set .    , @xmath277 , and @xmath272 against @xmath3 .",
    "the grey points show the observed colours of gama galaxies .",
    "we have deliberated selected two well - populated spikes in the gama redshift distribution .",
    "the coloured tracks show models from our spl , colour - coded by their metallicity .",
    "the @xmath249 dust obscuration vector is shown in the lower right corner of each panel .",
    "the point to be made from this figure is that the single metallicity stellar populations in our library only sparsely cover the observed optical ",
    "nir colour  colour space of real galaxies .",
    "a finer metallicity grid in the stellar evolution models is required for adequate synthetic stellar population modelling including nir data .",
    "[ fig : badnir],width=294 ]      the upper panels of figure [ fig : badnir ] show @xmath3 versus @xmath278 .",
    "note that in the optical , the different uniform metallicity models in our spl almost completely overlap .",
    "but as you go further towards the nir ( lower panels ) , the distance between the different metallicity tracks steadily grows . looking at the bottom panels ,",
    "it is clear that the relatively coarse grid of @xmath74 values used for our present spl only sparsely samples the @xmath279 color space of real galaxies .",
    "particularly for the gap between @xmath280 and @xmath281 , the distance between the distinct metallicity tracks in @xmath272 becomes comparable to the imposed error floor of 0.05 mag ( see [ ch : sedfit ] ) .",
    "this explains the origin of the most striking feature of figure [ fig : bc03m05 ] : the rather strong quantisation in @xmath74 .",
    "galaxies with colours that lie between the distinct metallicity tracks can only be fit by adopting the too - blue , lower metallicity model , with the addition of some dust to compensate .",
    "the implication , then , is that a finer grid of metallicities is required when working with nir data than when working with optical data alone .",
    "( this is a direct corollary to the fact that optical  minus ",
    "nir colours are sensitive to metatllicity in a way that optical colours are not . )",
    "the problem here is twofold .",
    "the first problem is a mundane , practical one : the size of our current spl is already about as big as we can deal with . with the current architecture of our code",
    ", we can not easily expand the grid in any one dimension without reducing its size in some other dimension to compensate .",
    "the bigger problem is that the bc03 ( like the m05 and cb07 ) ssp models cover only a relatively coarse grid in stellar metallicities . in principle",
    ", it is trivial to generate models with arbitrary metallicity by interpolating between the ssp models provided by @xcite , @xcite , or whomever .",
    "however , at fixed age , the @xmath74-dependence of both flux and sp properties is complex . for this reason",
    ", we consider it unwise to blindly interpolate between models of different metallicities .    to ensure that our coarse metallicity grid is not responsible for the problems we are seeing with the nir data , however ,",
    "we have tried re - fitting the galaxies in our main sample with @xmath169 galaxies ( _ i.e. _ , we have reduced the size of our redshift grid by a factor of @xmath282 ) using a finer @xmath74 grid for the spl .",
    "this grid , which we have generating by interpolating between the different metallicity ssp models at fixed age and wavelength , spans the same range as the native @xcite ssp grid in 24 logarithmically spaced steps .",
    "using a finer metallicity grid makes no appreciable difference to the quality of the fits to the optical  plus  nir data .",
    "the biggest difference between the two fits is that , with the finer @xmath74 grid , the inferred values of @xmath74 for galaxies with @xmath283 are systematically higher by @xmath222 dex .",
    "but even so , compared to the optical  plus  nir fits using the native @xcite metallicity grid , the change in the inferred value of @xmath4 is less than 0.06 dex for 99 % of galaxies ; the median change is @xmath284 dex . we therefore conclude that simply expanding our metallicity grid does not fix our current problems with incorporating the nir data into the sps fits , nor does it significantly improve the accuracy of our stellar mass estimates .    in principle , it is easy to accommodate more sophisticated treatments of mixed metallicities by generalising equation ( [ eq : csp ] ) so that the sfr is an explicit function of @xmath74 as well as @xmath73 . in practice , however , the principal disadvantage to doing so is that we would want to specify or parameterise the relations between @xmath285 , and @xmath286 , whether explicitly , or in terms of appropriate priors .",
    "( further , this does not address the issue of whether and how one can safely generate ssp models of arbitrary metallicity . )",
    "one simple way to accomplish this would be to assume an exponentially - declining gas accretion rate with a characteristic timescale @xmath287 , coupled with assumptions about stellar gas recycling back into the ism ( as done by , e.g. , pgase ; * ? ? ?",
    "again , the apparent insensitivity of our @xmath18 estimates argues against this having a large impact on our stellar mass estimates ; it may , however , lead to improvements in our estimates of both @xmath74 and @xmath208 .      for the present work , we have limited ourselves to considering smooth , exponentially declining sfhs .",
    "a number of authors have attempted to incorporate or allow for more complicated sfhs in their sps calculations .",
    "one approach has been to increase the dimensionality of the spl parameter space by introducing additional sp components as short bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can also use figure [ fig : badnir ] to explore what impact the inclusion of more complicated sfhs in our spl might have . consider what happens to any of the models in figure [ fig : badnir ] with the addition of a secondary burst of star formation .",
    "if any two of the models shown in figure [ fig : badnir ] are combined in any proportion , the evolutionary track of the resultant sp must necessarily lie between the individual tracks of the two distinct sp components . if you were to combine any two sps with the same dust and metallicity , but different sfhs ,",
    "the result will necessarily still lie trapped within the region of colour space spanned by the smooth models .",
    "that is , so long as any secondary stellar population has the same dust and metallicity , it will not be easily distinguishable from any of our existing smooth models .",
    "this insight is significant in terms of the results of @xcite .",
    "these authors find that sfh - related degeneracies mean that the inclusion of bursty sfhs among the spl model templates does little to reduce this bias for bursty galaxies .",
    "further , there is the potential that the inclusion of too many bursty spl models can lead to biases in _ non_-bursting galaxies . in other words , because these scenarios can not be distinguished on the basis of their seds , a bias in @xmath18 is inevitable , whether that be a small bias for the many ` smooth sfh ' galaxies , or a large bias for the fewer bursty galaxies .",
    "note , too , that in this picture , the degree of the bias is strongly dependent on the assumed priors .",
    "the implication from the above , then , is that the inclusion of models with mixed metallicities and/or multi - component sfhs will improve our sp parameter estimates only to the extent that they expand the high - dimensional colour space spanned by the full ensemble of spl models .",
    "and then , multi - component sfhs will only expand the spl colour space if and only if the different components are allowed to have different amounts of dust and/or metals .    in order to meaningfully incorporate dual - component sps",
    "thus requires the addition of at least five parameters to describe the secondary sp : the equivalent of a ` formation time ' ; some characteristic timescale for the secondary sfh ( _ i.e. _ , an @xmath83-folding time , or some equivalent ) ; its mass relative to the primary ; and then both its metallicity , and its dust content . with the current architecture of our sps code ,",
    "such an expansion of parameter space is completely impractical .",
    "we would therefore appear to have reached the practical limits of complexity that can be covered by discrete grid - search - like fitting algorithms using a static spl .",
    "independently of the question of nir data issues , any future expansion of the model parameter space will have to be accompanied by a change in the conceptual framework that underpins our sps modelling procedure .",
    "alternative approaches apply standard dimensionality - reducing techniques , developed in the context of data compression , to the problem .",
    "one example is the ` moped ` algorithm @xcite , which uses a variant of principal component analysis ( pca ) to efficiently perform a 23-component sps fit to full sdss spectra , including a generalised 10-bin sfh ( see also ` vespa ` ; * ? ? ?",
    "another example is ` kcorrect ` @xcite , which uses the technique of non - negative matrix factorisation ( nmf ) .",
    "the idea here is to determine the basis set of template spectra that optimally describes the observed seds of real galaxies .",
    "the nmf basis set is constructed as a combination of sp template spectra ; this means that the basis templates constructed using the nmf algorithm can be considered as sps template spectra with realistic , multi - component , non - parametric sfhs .",
    "the principal motivation for and advantage of these approaches is that they can eliminate entirely the need to assume parametric forms for the sfh . in the context of the above discussion",
    ", the operational advantage of such approaches can be thought of as shifting from sampling a static and semi - regular grid of parameter values to a dynamic sampling of an expanded but continuous parameter space .",
    "the main point to take from the above discussion is that proper modelling of the optical - to - nir sed shapes of galaxies is considerably more challenging than modelling just the optical sed .",
    "part of the reason for this is that , for a fixed optical colour , a galaxy s optical  nir colour is sensitive to both @xmath74 and to @xmath208 .",
    "said another way it is precisely because a galaxy s optical ",
    "nir sed can break metallicity - related degeneracies that it becomes necessary to model each of these quantities in more detail  indeed , in more detail than is practical within the present architecture of our code . on the other hand , the relatively strong degeneracies between a galaxy s sp properties and",
    "its optical sed shape means that sps fitting of optical seds can be done using a relatively crude spl .",
    "the primary purpose of this work has been to present and describe the ` first generation ' estimates of stellar mass and other ancillary stellar population parameters for galaxies in the gama survey .",
    "we have deliberately set out to use widely used and accepted techniques to derive these values , partially in order to allow for the fairest comparison between results from gama and other high and low redshift galaxy surveys .",
    "our stellar mass estimates are based on the synthetic stellar population models of @xcite , assuming a @xcite imf and a @xcite dust law ( [ ch : models ] ) . in constructing the stellar population library that forms the backbone of the calculation , we have used the standard assumptions of a single metallicity and a continuous , exponentially - declining star formation history for all stellar populations , with dust modelled as a single , uniform screen ( [ ch : sedfit ] ) .",
    "the most significant ` non - standard ' element of the calculation is that we use a bayesian approach when determining the fiducial values of all parameters and their associated uncertainties ( [ ch : bayes ] ) .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : bfvsml ] , this decision has an important _ systematic _ effect on the parameter estimates : averaged over the full gama sample , the _ most likely _ ( in a bayesian sense ) values of @xmath4 are @xmath10 dex higher than those taken from the single _ best fit _",
    "( _ i.e. _ , maximum likelihood ) sp template .",
    "while the mpa - jhu mass estimates for sdss used a bayesian approach , this is not ( yet ) generally done in high redshift studies .      through comparison between the gama- and sdss - derived values of @xmath18 and @xmath13 ( appendix [ ch : cfsdss ] ) , we highlight two important issues with the sdss ` model `  photometry .",
    "first , we show that as a measure of total flux , the sdss ` model ` photometry has serious systematics as a function of ( true ) srsic - index ( figure [ fig : mags ] ) . for galaxies best - fit by an exponential ` model ` profile ,",
    "the differential bias between @xmath288 and @xmath289 is @xmath290 mag ( @xmath291 % ) ; for those best - fit by a de vaucouleurs ` model ` profile , the differential bias between @xmath292 and @xmath293 is @xmath294 mag ( a factor of 2 ) .",
    "these systematic biases in total luminosity translate directly to biases in total stellar mass : this may be the single largest source of error in the sdss mass estimates based on ` model `  photometry .",
    "second , if we apply our algorithm to the sdss ` model ` seds , we see very large differences between our derived values and those from the mpa - jhu catalogue ( figure [ fig : cfsdss ] ) . these differences are directly tied to strong systematic differences between the sdss ` model ` and gama ` auto ` colours ( [ ch : modelseds ] ) , such that the net systematic offset in @xmath295 is as large as 0.2 mag ( figure [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that it may be more appropriate to use ` petro ` seds when analysing data from the sdss photometry catalogues .    despite these differences in the sdss and gama photometry ,",
    "the fiducial gama values of @xmath18 are in excellent agreement with those found in the latest generation mpa - jhu catalogue for sdss dr7 ( section [ ch : cfsdss ] ) , which have been shown to be well consistent with dynamical mass estimates @xcite .",
    "( we investigate the consistency between gama - derived stellar and dynamical mass estimates in a companion paper . ) as we argue in [ ch : modelmasses ] , the inclusion of a dust prior in the mpa - jhu stellar mass estimation algorithm may have effectively circumvented the potential bias in stellar population parameters based on the sdss ` model ` photometry ; using the gama ` auto ` photometry , we find no need for such a prior .",
    "for the present generation of stellar mass estimates , we have elected _ not _ to include the available @xmath99 nir photometry in the sed - fitting ; the stellar population parameters presented here are based on fits to the optical @xmath20 seds only .    as summarised in [ ch : badnir ] , there are three reasons for this decision .",
    "first , none of the commonly used stellar population models @xcite provide good fits to the full optical  to  nir seds ( figure [ fig : residuals ] ) .",
    "second , while the inclusion of the nir data does have an impact on the derived values ",
    "the median value of @xmath13 goes down by 0.15 dex when the nir data are included ",
    "the values derived with the nir are formally inconsistent with those derived from the just the optical data for a large fraction of galaxies . both of these points suggest inconsistencies between the optical  to  nir sed shapes of real galaxies and those of the models in our spl .",
    "the third reason is that we find that the ` random ' differences in inferred sp parameters ",
    "particularly @xmath82 , @xmath74 , and @xmath208using different ssp models are larger than than the formal uncertainties once the nir data are included .",
    "that is , our sp parameter estimates become significantly model dependent when , and only when , the nir data are used .",
    "that said , the _ systematic _ differences in the inferred sp parameters based on different ssp models are small : for @xmath18 , the median difference in the value of @xmath18 using the bc03 and m05 ssp models is just 0.02 dex .",
    "we therefore consider it unlikely that the failure of the models to adequately accommodate the nir data is due to differences between or uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves .",
    "this leaves two possibilities : that there may be problems in the nir data , and/or that the stellar population library that we have used is insufficient to describe the full range of stellar populations that exist in the local universe .",
    "these issues will have to be addressed  both through additional data validation and verification and through expansion of our stellar population library to include additional metallicities and possibly more sophisticated star formation histories  in the construction of future generations of the gama stellar mass catalogues .",
    "we have discussed possible avenues for expanding our spl in [ ch : future ] , and conclude that any future expansion to our spl parameter space will have to be accompanied by a change in the conceptual framework of our sps fitting procedure .",
    "we would appear to have reached the practical limit of complexity for a simple grid - search - like approach using a static spl .",
    "note that future catalogues will make use of considerably deeper vst optical imaging from kids and vista nir imaging from the viking survey . in this context , it is highly significant that , even with the present photometry , the accuracy of our sp parameter estimates are not currently limited by signal  to  noise , but by systematics . with the exception of the @xmath187-band ,",
    "the photometric errors are smaller than the error floor of 0.05 mag that we have imposed for the fits ( see [ ch : sedfit ] ) .",
    "the extent to which the deeper data will improve on the present sps fitting results will depend crucially on how well the data can be self - consistency cross - calibrated , including biases due to psf- and aperture - matching , colour gradients , and background subtraction , as well as the basic photometric calibration . as a corollary to this",
    ", it will be incumbent upon us to ensure that the model photometry in any future spl can be considered accurate to the same level as the real data ; @xmath296 mag .      in light of our decision to ignore the presently available nir data , we have reexamined the commonly - held belief that nir data are crucial to deriving a robust and reliable estimate of stellar mass ( [ ch : gimoverl ] ) .",
    "we use generic properties of the stellar population models to demonstrate that on its own , the @xmath202-band flux is nearly as good a representation of the total stellar population as is the nir flux ( [ ch : moverls ] ) .",
    "more quantitatively , assuming a constant @xmath4 or @xmath239 , it is possible to use @xmath244 or @xmath246 to estimate @xmath13 to within a factor of 5.5 or 4.5 , respectively .    using a similar argument",
    ", we show that the variation in @xmath4 _ at fixed _",
    "@xmath3 is @xmath242 dex ( figure [ fig : moverls ] ) .",
    "the effect of dust is largely to shift galaxies along the @xmath3@xmath4 relation .",
    "dust thus does not significantly affect one s ability to estimate @xmath4 using @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we show that , for a given model , variations in age , sfh , and metallicity act to largely preserve the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 colour ( figure [ fig : gimodels ] ) .",
    "further , we show that multi - component stellar populations ( e.g. , a burst superposed over an old and passive stellar population ) fall within the same region of @xmath3@xmath4 space as the exponentially - declining star formation histories that comprise our stellar population library . in this way , based on generic properties of stellar evolution models , we show that @xmath3 colour can be used to estimate @xmath13 to within a factor of @xmath19 , even considering the well known dust  age  metallicity degeneracy , and even for multi - component stellar populations ( [ ch : gimodels ] ) .    finally , we consider the empirical relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 for gama galaxies .",
    "it is significant that the observed relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 is both more linear and considerably tighter ( at fixed colour , the scatter in @xmath4 is @xmath5 dex ) than we might expect by simply taking the prior - weighted average of the models in our stellar population library ( figure [ fig : colourrel ] ) .",
    "this implies that the full @xmath20 sed shape contains additional information not found in the @xmath3 colour , and that this information is sufficient to exclude a significant range of the models in our library .",
    "the tightness of the @xmath3@xmath4 relation is not merely a consequence of the central limit theorem .    in other words ,",
    "there are two completely separate reasons why @xmath3 is an excellent predictor of @xmath4 , both of which are entirely fortuitous .",
    "first , variations in age , sfh , dust , and metallicity  independently and _ en masse_largely preserve the @xmath3@xmath4 relation .",
    "this is a coincidence produced by the physics of stellar evolution .",
    "second , the stellar populations of real galaxies produce a @xmath3@xmath4 relation that is both tighter and more nearly linear than might be expected from stellar population models alone .",
    "this is a coincidence produced by the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .    in this sense , presuming that both our derived values and their associated uncertainties are reasonable , we have effectively ` calibrated ' the @xmath3@xmath4 relation to a precision of @xmath5 dex ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "the derived relation offers a reliable and robust means for observers to derive stellar masses based on minimal information .",
    "similarly , under the ( non - trivial ) assumption that the relation does not evolve strongly with redshift , it offers a simple and transparent basis for fair comparison between results derived from gama and other low- and high - redshift surveys . as an important caveat on the use of this relation ,",
    "however , any and all systematic errors or uncertainties in the spl itself  including , e.g. , the imf and errors in the treatment of the _ optical _ stellar evolution tracks  are not included in the quoted uncertainty of 0.1 dex . on the other hand , the relation given does offer a solid means for other surveys to compare their stellar mass - centric measures to those from gama under the identical assumptions .",
    "the stellar mass estimates we have described have been or will be used for a wide variety of recent and ongoing studies by the gama collaboration .",
    "these include studies of variability in the stellar imf @xcite , measurement of the @xmath16 mass function @xcite , the properties of galaxies at the lowest end of the h@xmath298 luminosity function @xcite , and studies of galaxy demographics in the field ( taylor et al .  in prep .",
    ") , in groups ( prescott et al .  in prep .",
    ") , and in filaments ( pimbblett et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "further , they provide an important benchmark for any and all future gama stellar mass and sp parameter estimates .    in line with the legacy goals of the gama survey , these stellar mass estimates are also being made publicly available for use by the wider astronomical community as part of gama dr 2 ( scheduled for mid-2011 ) .",
    "gama s unique combination of depth and survey area have been deliberately chosen to bridge the gap between large - scale local universe surveys like 6dfgs , sdss and 2dfgrs , and deep surveys of the high redshift universe like vvds , deep-2 , and zcosmos . particularly in combination with these other major surveys ,",
    "the gama catalogues are intended to provide a valuable laboratory for studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "let us look first at the right - hand panel of this figure , in which we show the difference between the known , input photometry , and the recovered , output photometry , after fitting to the mock @xmath64 seds .",
    "put simply , the quality of the fits is near perfect .",
    "the residuals are at the millimag level for all but the @xmath187-band ; the median residual in the @xmath187-band is still just 0.02 mag .",
    "none of these residuals is significant at the 0.1@xmath6 level .",
    "now consider the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : simresiduals ] , in which we show the residuals when fitting to the mock @xmath20 seds .",
    "our primary interest here is in how well we are able to predict nir photometry for the mock galaxies using their @xmath20 seds . in comparison to figure [ fig : residuals ] , there are three features of this plot that we find striking .",
    "first , it is clear that , as in figure [ fig : residuals ] , the nir photometry predicted from the mock optical seds is systematically too bright .",
    "quantitatively , in comparison to figure [ fig : residuals ] , the size of the discrepancy is considerably smaller . for the mock galaxies , the residuals",
    "are @xmath5 mag ; roughly half that seen for real gama galaxies . compared to the photometric errors , the median significance of these offsets is @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 in the @xmath99 bands ; again , roughly half that seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] .",
    "second , the residuals for the mock galaxies show a qualitatively different dependence on rest - frame wavelength / redshift than is seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] . whereas for real galaxies , the offsets in each individual band appear to be greatest at the highest and lowest redshifts , for the mock galaxies , the offsets grow rather smoothly for longer and longer wavelengths .",
    "that is , for the mock galaxies , our results suggest that one s ability to predict nir photometry depends primarily on how far one is willing to extrapolate off the red end of the observed optical sed .",
    "third , we note that , just as in figure [ fig : residuals ] , we do see some residuals in the optical bands .",
    "quantitatively , the median residual in each of the @xmath20 bands is @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath304 , and @xmath306 mag , respectively ; in all cases , this is insignificant at the level of @xmath307 . in comparison to those seen in figure",
    "[ fig : residuals ] , these residuals are again roughly half the size as for real galaxies , but show a qualitatively similar ` curvature ' with wavelength .",
    "given the above , what are we to make of the ( very slight ) residuals in the @xmath20 fits ?",
    "since we are fitting to the same @xmath20 photometry in both of the above experiments , the additional information provided by the nir photometry must exclude some of those models that are consistent with the optical data on its own .",
    "in other words , the models allowed by the 5-band fits span a broader range of sp parameter values than those allowed by the 9-band fits ; the set of spl templates allowed by the 5-band fits must be a superset of those allowed by the 9-band fits .",
    "( we will look at precisely how the sp parameter estimates change with the inclusion of the nir data in a moment ; for now , let us keep the discussion general . )",
    "the implication of this , as is well known , is that an optical sed simply does not encode sufficient information to fully constrain a galaxy s sp parameters .    naturally , the models are distinguished by their sed shapes . from the fact that the @xmath20 fits",
    "tend to over - predict the ` true ' nir photometry of our mock galaxies , we know that the optical - only fits are consistent with a range of spl models , and that these models are on average redder than the ` real ' solution .",
    "now , the fiducial parameter estimate is derived from marginalising over the pdf  la equation [ eq : margin ] .",
    "again , for the optical - only fits , this includes a disproportionally large number of models with the ` wrong ' sed shape ; specifically , models that are substantially too red in the nir .",
    "but these models will also have ( very ) slightly different optical sed shapes .",
    "hence the very slight offsets seen in the optical bands when the nir data are excluded .    consider what would happen if we were to significantly change the form of our assumed priors in such a way as to make these redder fits less likely  for example , by making higher dust extinctions or metallicities less likely than lower ones .",
    "reducing the prior probability of these models directly reduces their contribution to the integral in equation [ eq : margin ] , which defines the bayesian ` most likely ' parameter value .",
    "this implies that if we were to use more realistic priors , we might be able to do a substantially better job of predicting the nir photometry based on the optical seds .",
    "( parenthetically , this may be why ` kcorrect ` is so successful at predicting nir photometry from optical colours . )    in this context , it is significant that the @xmath20 residuals seen when fitting only to the optical bands disappear when the nir data are included .",
    "this shows that our sps algorithm is in fact able to near - perfectly match galaxies seds given sufficient information , where we have also now shown that ` sufficient information ' means both optical and nir photometry .",
    "furthermore , this is possible even despite the fact that the assumed priors are very different from the real distribution intrinsic to the data .",
    "these experiments thus suggest that the gama optical  plus  nir dataset can , in principle , be used to constrain galaxies sp parameters to the extent that the quality of the fits is not sensitive to the assumed priors .",
    "said another way ( and more accurately ) , so long as nir data are available , the way that the photometry uncertainties map onto sp parameter space means the allowed range of sp parameters is small enough that the assumption that the priors are _ locally _ flat is a good one .        as we have already pointed out in [ ch : nirsummary ] , there is an important corollary to the idea that we are , in principle , able to near - perfectly match the ` observed ' seds in our mock catalogue .",
    "once nir data are included , the quality of the fits is no longer limited by the amount of information that is encoded in the data , but instead by how closely the stellar populations that comprise the spl represent those found in the wild .",
    "this means that , to the extent that more complex stellar populations  including more complicated sfhs , a mix of stellar metallicities , and patchy dust geometries  change the shape of a galaxies seds ,",
    "these effects must be adequately folded into the construction of the spl . in other words , precisely _ because _ nir data provides the additional sp parameter information not found in the optical , robust and reliable fits to optical  plus  nir seds require more sophisticated spls ( see also [ ch : future ] . )",
    "whereas in the previous section we have focussed on how well our sps fitting algorithm is able to describe or reproduce the sed shapes of mock galaxies , we now turn to the question of how well galaxies sp parameters can be constrained from their broadband sed shapes .      in * figure",
    "[ fig : reliable ] * , we show how accurately we are able to recover the sp parameters associated with the mock galaxies based either on their optical - only ( left panels ) or optical  to  nir ( right panels ) photometry , and in the face of realistic observational uncertainties . in all cases ,",
    "the ` @xmath145s ' on the @xmath146 axis should be understood as being the ` output ",
    "minus  input ' parameter value , plotted as a function of the ` known ' , input value from the mock catalogue . as in figures [ fig : optnir ] and [ fig : bc03m05 ] , the colour - scale shows the logarithmic data density , with the percentile equivalents of the @xmath308 points of the distributions given with the histograms at right .",
    "the first  and , in the context of our main argument , the most crucial  point to be made from these plots is that we are able to recover the @xmath4s of the mock galaxies with no discernible bias based on the optical seds alone .",
    "further , the @xmath4 determinations derived from fits including nir photometry are not all that much more reliable than those based only on the optical data : on the one hand , the 1 @xmath6 ` errors ' are @xmath309 dex ; on the other , they are @xmath310 dex .    in line with the results of the previous section , where we have shown that our priors tend to over - weight models with redder sed shapes , the optical - only fits imply slightly too - red @xmath3 colours .",
    "empirically , the error is @xmath311 mag ; using the slope of the empirical @xmath3@xmath4 relation , this translates to an error of @xmath312 dex in @xmath4 .    for the other sp parameters , as for @xmath4 , the inclusion of nir data does not appear to be crucial to obtaining reliable parameter estimates .",
    "the median offset between the known and the recovered sp parameter values for the optical  plus  nir fits is not clearly less than for the optical  only fits .",
    "that said , the inclusion of nir data clearly does reduce the ` random ' error in the derived sp parameters  that is , the robustness  particularly in the case of @xmath74 and @xmath82 , as well as @xmath84 for those ` passive ' galaxies with @xmath313 .",
    "the final question to be considered here is how precisely galaxies sp parameters can be constrained based on sed fits with or without nir photometry .",
    "we address this question with reference to * figure [ fig : robust ] * , which shows the distribution of the formal uncertainties in sp parameter estimates derived from the mock photometric catalogues , based on fits to optical  only ( left panels ) or optical  plus  nir ( right panels ) seds .    looking at the global distribution of uncertainties for all galaxies in the mock catalogues , the greatest effect of the nir is to reduce the uncertainties on @xmath74 and on @xmath208 .",
    "the median value of @xmath314 goes from 0.35 dex to 0.25 dex with the inclusion of the nir , while the median value of @xmath315 goes from 0.26 dex to 0.19 dex . by comparison ,",
    "the improvement in @xmath316 is relatively minor : the median value goes from 0.10 dex to 0.07 mag .",
    "it is interesting to compare this improvement in @xmath317 to that in @xmath143 , which goes from 0.21 to 0.18 dex , and in @xmath318 , which remains nearly unchanged at 0.21 dex .",
    "this suggests that while nir photometry helps to break degeneracies between @xmath208 and @xmath74 ( and to a lesser extent @xmath82 ) , and so helps provide a better constraint on instantaneous mean stellar age , it does not provide much additional information concerning the precise sfh .",
    "but again , the nir data does not lead to a substantial improvement in the accuracy with which @xmath4 can be determined : the median value of @xmath319 goes from 0.11(4 ) dex ( @xmath320 % ) to 0.09(8 ) dex ( @xmath321 ) .",
    "the nir encodes virtually no additional information concerning a galaxy s stellar mass that can not be found in the optical .",
    "this fact has one important implication for future stellar mass catalogues . in the previous section",
    ", we found that we were able to recover @xmath4 for the mock galaxies with an empirical @xmath297 ` error ' on the order of @xmath322 dex , both with and without the inclusion of nir data ; _ i.e. _ , more precisely than might be expected from the formal uncertainties of @xmath323 dex .",
    "the reason for this is that , in generating the mock photometry , we have added random photometric errors commensurate with the random photometric errors ; in the fitting , on the other hand , we include an error ` floor ' of 0.05 mag .",
    "this error is intended to account for potential differential systematic errors between the different photometric bands .",
    "the implication is thus that the accuracy of our stellar mass determinations is not limited by signal  to  noise ( _ i.e. _ , the random observational uncertainties in the photometry in each band ) , but instead by the relative accuracy of the photometry in the different bands with respect to one another ( _ i.e. _ , differential systematic errors between the different bands ) .",
    "this means that the extent to which the considerably deeper vst and vista photometry will improve our ability to constrain galaxies stellar masses will depend crucially on how well we are able to control systematic photometric errors in the different bands , including the accuracy of the basic photometric calibrations .",
    "in this appendix , as a means of validating our stellar mass estimates , we compare them to the latest generation of stellar mass estimates from the mpa - jhu catalogue for sdss dr7 .",
    "the motivation for this comparison stems from the fact that the mpa - jhu mass - to - light ratios have been well tested ; they thus provide a useful set of benchmark measurements .",
    "they are in excellent agreement with other frequently used mpa - jhu mass determinations ; e.g. , the @xcite dr4 catalogue .",
    "dex , with a scatter on the order of 0.1 dex ; see http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/mass_comp.html ] that is , the ( sed - derived ) dr7 mass estimates are wholly consistent with values derived from spectra .",
    "further , @xcite have compared the dr7 mpa - jhu stellar masses to dynamical mass estimates , derived using the srsic - fit structural parameters of @xcite . based on the consistency between these stellar mass estimates and dynamical mass estimates ,",
    "@xcite have argued that any differential biases in the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratio as a function of stellar population parameters may be as low as @xmath14 dex ( @xmath324 % ) .-2    there are two facets to this comparison : differences in sdss and gama photometry from which the mass estimates are derived , and differences in the algorithms used to actually derive the mass estimates .",
    "we compare the gama and sdss photometry in [ ch : sdssphot ] . after describing the key differences between the sdss and gama algorithms in [ ch : sdssmasses ]",
    ", we will then look at our ability to reproduce the sdss stellar mass and stellar mass - to - light ratio values using first sdss ` model `  the and then the gama ` auto `  photometry in [ ch : automasses ] and [ ch : modelmasses ] , respectively . in this way",
    ", we will hope to identify whether and how these differences affect the derived values for @xmath18 and @xmath13 . before we begin , let us again stress that the rationale behind this comparison is that the sdss mass - to - light ratios have been well tested ; our main concern is thus our ability to reproduce the sdss values for the galaxies that are common to both sdss and gama .",
    "the basic sdss catalogue contains two different photometric measures in each of the @xmath20 bands . following the recommendation of @xcite",
    ", it is standard practice to use ` model ` photometry to construct multi - band seds .",
    "this photometry comes from fitting either an exponential or a de vaucouleurs profile to the observed light distribution .",
    "the choice of profile shape and structural parameters ( _ i.e. _ , effective radius , ellipticity , and position angle ) are based on the @xmath37-band image . for the @xmath325-bands these parameters are then held fixed during fits , so that only overall normalisation is allowed to vary ; this is then the ` model ` flux .",
    "the mpa - jhu mass estimates are based on the ` model `  seds taken from the basic sdss catalog .",
    "the second photometric measure is the ` petro ` magnitude , which is based on the idea of @xcite .",
    "this flux is measured within a flexible circular aperture , the size of which is based on the observed ( radial ) surface brightness profile . again following the recommendations of @xcite , it is standard practice to use the ` petro ` photometry as a measure of total flux .",
    "accordingly , when we consider @xmath326 below , we will scale the mpa - jhu mass estimates by @xmath327 to obtain ` total ' mass estimates .",
    "this is directly analogous to our use of seds based on matched aperture ` auto ` photometry , scaled to match ` sersic ` total magnitudes .      in * figure",
    "[ fig : mags ] * , we compare the different gama and sdss photometric measures of @xmath37-band flux .",
    "this comparison is based on the @xmath328 sdss - targeted galaxies that appear in the gama catalogue . in this figure",
    ", we distinguish between those galaxies whose sdss ` model `  photometry is based on an exponential ( blue points ) or a de vaucouleurs ( red points ) profile.-2    in each case , it is clear that the relation between different photometric measures depends most strongly on profile shape ( parameterised by the gama @xmath37-band derived srsic  index , @xmath329 ) . for @xmath330 , the difference between the gama srsic - fit and sdss ` petro `  fluxes is more or less as expected : the fraction of missed flux increases rapidly from @xmath331 for @xmath332 , to @xmath184 0.1 mag for @xmath333 galaxies , to @xmath334 mag for @xmath335 , and so on .",
    "the most striking feature of figure [ fig : mags ] is the large @xmath329-dependent differences between the sdss ` model `  and gama ` sersic `  and ` auto`photometry . the crucial assumption behind the sdss ` model `",

    "as expected , the ` petro`magnitude misses an increasingly large fraction of total flux for galaxies with higher values of @xmath329 .",

    "quantitatively , the observed ` gama ` auto`minus  sdss ` model ` ' offsets are @xmath346 mag , @xmath347 mag , @xmath348 mag , and @xmath349 mag ; the cumulative offset between @xmath187 and @xmath101 is thus @xmath350 mag .",
    "these offsets are not a strong function of apparent brightness . particularly for the bluer bands , they may depend weakly on srsic  index .",
    "further , looking at the right - hand panels of this figure , there is the hint that the offsets vary systematically with observed colour : this immediately suggests that colour gradients may play a role in one or the other of these measurements .",
    "note that we find no such systematic offsets between the gama ` auto `  and sdss ` petro `  colours .",

    "taken together , these two points suggest that that when using sdss photometry , despite the fact that the ` petro `  photometry is not psf - matched , it may provide a better basis for constructing multi - colour seds than ` model `  photometry .    [",

    "that is , the problem appears to be specific to the sdss ` model `  photometry .",
    "we have seen that the sdss ` model `  seds are systematically redder than those constructed using gama ` auto `  magnitudes .",
    "the effect of these differences can be understood by looking at figure [ fig : ugri ] . using the ` model `  seds , the ` problem ' objects ( that is , those galaxies where there are large differences in the gama- and sdss- derived stellar mass estimates ) prefer templates with young ages ( @xmath371 gyr ) , high metallicity ( @xmath372 ; the highest value allowed in our bc03 library ) and moderately heavy dust extinction ( @xmath373 ) .",
    "when using the gama ` auto ` photometry , these objects come out to be considerably older ( @xmath374 gyr ) , lower metallicity ( @xmath375 ) and less dusty ( @xmath3760.10 ) .    looking carefully at the @xmath377 region of figure [ fig : ugri ]",
    ", one can see that immediately above the broad strip defined by the older , low - ssfr models ( colour - coded red in the upper - left panel ) , there is a narrower strip of models with ages @xmath378 gyr ( colour - coded green ) . in the lower - lefthand panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ugri ] , these models can also be seen to have @xmath379 ( colour - coded red ) .",
    "note that this is precisely the regime where we see the largest differences in the gama- and mpa - jhu - derived @xmath18s .",
    "this explains the differences between our stellar mass estimates based on the ` auto `  and ` model `  photometry : the 0.13 mag offset in @xmath71 between the ` model `  and ` auto `  photometry pushes these galaxies up towards the upper edge of the region of colour space spanned by the models . the redder @xmath71 ` model `  colours thus open up a qualitatively different , young , high - metallicity stellar population solution for what would otherwise be old , lower - metallicity galaxies .    but",
    "how is it that the sdss stellar mass estimates , which are based on the ` wrong ' ` model `  seds still get the ` right ' value for @xmath380 ?",
    "we speculate that the answer may lie in the different metallicity and/or dust priors used by the mpa - jhu team .",
    "the priors most strongly affect galaxies with low metallicities and dust extinction ( jarle brinchmann , private communication ; 24/09/2009 ) ; these are precisely the kinds of galaxies where we see the greatest discrepancies between the gama- and mpa - jhu - derived values of @xmath18 .",
    "that is , it would seem that the ` problem ' dustier , younger , and high - metallicity solutions preferred by the ` model `  photometry are down - weighted by the inclusion of a dust prior in the mpa - jhu algorithm . here ,",
    "too , the sdss decision to use the median , rather than the mean , of the pdf will help to reduce any susceptibility to a ` bimodality ' in the pdf , and so reduce the likelihood of choosing these ` problem ' solutions . in our case , using the gama ` auto `  photometry , the inclusion of such a prior is unnecessary .",
    "again , our primary motivation for performing this comparison is to test our ability to reproduce the well tested mpa - jhu values for @xmath18 . given that we have demonstrated our ability to do so using our own @xmath20 photometry , and the fact that without access to the mpa - jhu algorithm we are unable to perform any more detailed tests or comparisons , we have not investigated this issue any further .",
    "in this appendix , we have compared the gama photometry and stellar mass estimates to those from sdss .",
    "our primary motivation for this comparison is that is has been argued , based on their consistency with dynamical mass estimates , the sdss stellar mass estimates have no strong systematic differential biases for galaxies with different stellar populations @xcite . when using the gama photometry , we find excellent agreement between our fiducial estimates of @xmath18s and those from sdss , with no strong differential biases as a function of mass , colour , or structure .",
    "this argues against there being any strong biases in the gama @xmath18 estimates .",
    "we will investigate this further through comparison between the gama stellar and dynamical mass estimates in a separate work .",
    "we have also shown that there are significant differences between the gama and sdss estimates of total flux , which come from ` sersic `  and ` model`photometry , respectively .",
    "these differences are a strong function of @xmath329 : for @xmath336 and @xmath337 galaxies , where the sdss ` model `  assumes the ` right ' value of @xmath329 , we find excellent agreement between the two surveys photometry .",
    "away from these points , however , the ` model `  photometry is strongly biased . for de vaucouleurs - like galaxies , the size of the differential bias in the `",
    "model`photometry is as large as a factor of 2 .",
    "this will have a significant impact on a number of stellar mass - centric measurements like the mass function or the size  mass relationship .",
    "we have shown that there are significant systematic differences between the gama- and sdss - derived colours , which are derived from ` auto `  and ` model`photometry , respectively .",
    "the sdss ` model `  photometry is systematically redder , with a net offset of @xmath381 mag .",
    "we suggest that it may be better to use ` petro ` , rather than ` model `  photometry when analysing sdss data : we find no such differentials between the gama ` auto `  and sdss ` petro`photometry . when we apply our sps pipeline to the ` model `  photometry",
    ", our stellar mass estimates no longer agree well with those from sdss .",
    "we suggest that these differences may be explained by the different priors used in the sdss pipeline , which act to downweight young , moderately dusty , and high metallicity sps fits . in the case of sdss",
    ", their priors would seem to effectively circumvent the potential biases in @xmath18 that these photometric biases might produce . in our case",
    ", we are able to reproduce the well - tested sdss values with no need for such priors ."
