    "one of the characteristic features of geophysical flows ( see for instance  @xcite ) is stratification ( the other one is rotation ) . in this manuscript",
    ", we study some problems related to suspensions of heavy particles in incompressible slightly compressible- fluids .",
    "our aim is a better understanding of mixing phenomena between the two phases , the fluid and solid one .",
    "we especially study this problem because ( turbulent ) mixing with stratification plays a fundamental role in the dynamics of both oceanic and atmospheric flows . in this study , we perform the analysis of some models related to the transport of heavy dilute particles , with special emphasis on their mixing . observe that mixing is very relevant near the surface and the bottom of the ocean , near topographic features , near polar and marginal seas , as well as near the equatorial zones  @xcite . especially in coastal waters , precise analysis of transport and dispersion is needed to study biological species , coastal discharges , and also transport of contaminants .",
    "the other main motivation of our study is a better understanding of transport of particles ( e.g. dust and pollution ) in the air .",
    "this happens -for instance- in volcanic eruptions or more generally by natural and/or human generation of jets / plumes of particles in the atmosphere .    following  @xcite , in the physical regimes we will consider , it is appropriate to use the eulerian approach , that is the solid - phase ( the particles ) will be modeled as a continuum .",
    "this choice is motivated by the presence of a huge number of particles and because we are analyzing the so called `` fine particle '' regime ( that is the stokes number is much smaller than one ) . in this regime",
    ", a lagrangian approach could be computationally expensive , and the eulerian approach may offer more computationally efficient alternatives .",
    "we will explain the precise assumptions that make this _ ansatz _ physically representative and we will also study numerically the resulting models , with and without large scales further approximation .",
    "in particular , we will model the particles as dust , investigating a model related to _",
    "dusty gases _ , and which belongs to the hierarchy of reduced multiphase models , as reviewed by balachandar  @xcite .",
    "these models represent a good approximation when the number of fine particles to be traced is very large and a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the fluid with a lagrangian tracer for each particle would be too expensive . as well explained in  @xcite ,",
    "the point - like eulerian approach for multiphase fluid - particle dynamics becomes even more efficient in the case of large eddy simulations ( les ) , because the physical diameter of the particles has to be compared with the large eddy length - scale and not with the smaller kolmogorov one .",
    "we will use the dusty gas model in a physical configuration that is very close to that modeled by the boussinesq system , and this explains why we compare our numerical results with those reported in  @xcite .",
    "observe that the dusty gas model reduces to the boussinesq system with a large prandtl number if : a ) the fluid velocity is divergence - free ; and b ) the relative ratio of solid and fluid bulk densities is very small ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] and eq .  ) .",
    "the approach we will use for multiphase fluids is well - described in marble  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , when the _ stokes time _",
    "which is the characteristic time of relaxation of the particle velocity with respect to the surrounding fluid is small enough and the number of particles is very large , it could be reasonable to use the eulerian approach ( instead of the lagrangian ) . in eulerian models both the carrier and the dispersed phase",
    "are treated as interpenetrating fluid media , and consequently both the particulate solid - phase and fluid - phase properties are expressed by a continuous field representation .",
    "originally we started studying these models in order to simulate ash plumes coming from volcanic eruptions , see  @xcite , but here we will show that the same approach could be also used to study some problems coming from other geophysical situations , at least for certain ranges of physical parameters .    our model is evaluated in a two dimensional _ dam - break problem _ , also known as the _ lock - exchange problem_. this problem , despite being concerned with a ) a simple domain ; b ) nice initial and boundary conditions ; and c ) smooth gravity external forcing , contains shear - driven mixing , internal waves , interactions with boundaries , and convective motions .",
    "the dam - break problem setup has long served as a paradigm configuration for studying the space - time evolution of gravity currents ( cf .",
    "consequently , we set up a canonical benchmark problem , for which an extensive literature is available : the vertical barrier separating fluid and fluid with particles is abruptly removed , and counter - propagating gravity currents initiate mixing",
    ". the time evolution can be quite complex , showing shear - driven mixing , internal waves interacting with the velocity , and gravitationally - unstable transients .",
    "this benchmark problem has been investigated experimentally and numerically for instance in  @xcite .",
    "both the impressive amount of data and the physical relevance of the problem make it an appropriate benchmark and a natural first step in the thorough assessment of any approximate model to study stratification .",
    "the results we obtain validate the proposed model as appropriate to simulate dilute suspensions of ash in the air . in addition , we found that new peculiar phenomena appear , which are generated by compressibility .",
    "even if the behavior of the simulations is qualitatively very close to that of the incompressible case , the ( even very slightly ) compressible character of the fluid produces a more complex behavior , especially in the first part of the simulations . to better investigate the efficiency and limitations of the numerical solver",
    ", the numerical tests will be performed by using both dns and les .",
    "complete discussion of the numerical results will be given in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "* plan of the paper : * in section  [ sec : models ] we present the reduced multiphase model we will consider , with particular attention to the correct evaluation of physical parameters that make the approximation effective . in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] we present the setting of the numerical experiments we performed .",
    "particular emphasis is posed on the initial conditions and on the interpretation and comparison of the results with those available in the literature .",
    "in order to study multiphase flows and especially ( even compressible ) flows with particles , some approximate and reduced models have been proposed in the literature . in the case of dilute suspensions ,",
    "a complete hierarchy of approximate models is available ( see  @xcite ) on the basis of two critical parameters determining the level of interaction between the liquid and solid phase : the fractional volume occupied by the dispersed - phase and the mass loading , ( that is the ratio of mass of the dispersed to carrier phase ) . when they are both small , the dominant effect on the dynamics of the dispersed - phase is that of the turbulent carrier flow ( _ one - way coupled _ ) .",
    "when the mass of the dispersed - phase is comparable with that of the carrier - phase , the back - influence of the dispersed - phase on the carrier - phase dynamics becomes relevant ( _ two - way coupled _ ) .",
    "when the fractional volume occupied by the dispersed - phase increases , interactions between particles become more important , requiring a _ four - way coupling_. in the extreme limit of very large concentration , we encounter the granular flow regime .    here , we consider rather heavy particles such that @xmath1 ( air ) , or @xmath2 ( liquid ) , where in the sequel the subscript `` @xmath3 '' stands for solid , while `` @xmath4 '' stands for fluid . here",
    "a hat @xmath5 denotes material densities ( as opposed to bulk densities ) : in particular , we suppose @xmath6 . a rather small particle / volume concentration must be assumed ( to have dilute suspensions ) , that is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume occupied by the particles over the total volume @xmath9 . when @xmath10 is smaller than @xmath0 , particle - particle collisions and interactions can be neglected and the particle - phase can be considered as a pressure - less and non - viscous continuum . in this situation",
    "the particles move approximately with the same velocity of the surrounding fluid , and the theory has been developed by carrier  @xcite ( see a review in marble  @xcite ) . with these assumptions",
    "the bulk densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are of the same order of magnitude , about @xmath13 in the case dust - in - air ( two - way coupling ) . in the case of water with particles",
    "the ratio @xmath14 is of the order of @xmath0 , hence particles behave very similarly to passive tracers ( almost one - way coupling ) .",
    "another assumption required by marble s analysis is that particles can be considered _ point - like _ , if their typical diameter @xmath15 is smaller than the smallest scale of the problem under analysis , that is the kolmogorov length @xmath16 ( dns ) , or the smallest resolved les length - scale @xmath17 ( les ) .    to describe the gas / fluid - particle drag",
    ", we observe that it depends in a strong nonlinear way on the local flow variables and especially on the relative reynolds number : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gas dynamic viscosity coefficient and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fluid and solid phase velocity field , respectively . on the other hand , for a point - like single particle and in the hypothesis of small velocities difference ( @xmath22 )",
    ", the drag force ( per volume unit ) acting on a single particle depends just linearly on the difference of velocities : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the _ particle relaxation time or stokes time _ , which is the time needed to a particle to equilibrate to a change of fluid velocity  @xcite , and @xmath25 is the fluid kinematic viscosity .",
    "in particular , in the case of water with particles we have @xmath26 , while in the case of a gas @xmath27 and hence @xmath28 in order to measure the lack of equilibrium between the two phases , we have to compare @xmath24 with the smallest time of the dynamics . in the turbulent regime ,",
    "the smallest time is the kolmogorov smallest eddy s turnover time @xmath29 ( dns ) ( cf .",
    "frisch  @xcite ) or analogously @xmath30 ( les ) .",
    "it is possible to characterize this situation by using as non - dimensional parameter the stokes number which is defined by comparing the stokes time with the fastest time - scale of the problem under analysis @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 ( the `` fine particle regime '' ) , we say that we have _ kinematic equilibrium _ between the two phases and so we can use in a consistent way the dusty gas model . in order to have also",
    "_ thermal equilibrium _ between the two phases , one has to assume that the _ thermal relaxation time _",
    "@xcite ) is small , that is : @xmath33 comparing the kinetic and thermal relaxation times , we get the stokes thermal time @xmath34 i.e. , the particle prandtl number , where @xmath35 is the solid - phase specific heat - capacity at constant volume and @xmath36 is its thermal conductivity . to ensure that the dusty gas model is physically reasonable ,",
    "both kinematic and thermal equilibrium must hold , that is , both stokes numbers should be less than @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that we have a single velocity @xmath37 for both phases and also a single temperature field @xmath38 .    to check that our assumptions are fulfilled",
    ", we first show that if the stokes number is small , then also the thermal stokes number remains small . indeed , using the typical value of the dynamic viscosity @xmath39 ( water ) or @xmath40 ( air ) , specific heat capacity @xmath41 and thermal conductivity @xmath42",
    ", we can evaluate the particle prandtl number in both cases : @xmath43 hence formula   shows that @xmath44 .",
    "summarizing , we used the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "continuum assumption for both the gaseous and solid phase ; 2 .   the solid - phase is dispersed ( @xmath45 ) , thus it is pressure - less and non - interacting ; 3 .",
    "the relative reynolds number between the solid and gaseous phases is smaller than one so that it is appropriate to use the stokes law for drag ; 4 .   the stokes number is smaller than one so that the eulerian approach is appropriate ; 5 .",
    "all the phases , either solid or gaseous , have the same velocity and temperature fields @xmath46 ( local thermal and kinematic equilibrium ) .",
    "we showed that this assumption is accurate if the stokes number is much smaller than one .    in this regime ,",

    "the stress - tensor is @xmath51,\\ ] ] with @xmath52 the dynamic viscosity , possibly depending on the temperature @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the spatial dimension of the problem .",
    "the fourier law for the heat transfer assumes @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the fluid thermal conductivity .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 and @xmath35 the fluid and solid phase specific heat - capacity at constant volume , respectively .",
    "system   is completed by using the constitutive law @xmath58 . in the case of air and particles ( the one for which we will present the simulations )",
    "@xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the air gas constant . +",
    "* remark 1 .",
    "* the correct law would be @xmath61 , but in our dilute setting @xmath62 is very small , which justifies the approximation @xmath59 .",
    "a different constitutive law must be used in the presence of water or other fluids . + * remark 2 . *",
    "note that the constant particle pressure @xmath63 is justified by the lack of particle - particle forces .",
    "note that in the case of uniform particle distribution ( @xmath64 ) , the equations   reduce to the compressible navier - stokes equations , with density multiplied by a factor @xmath65 .",
    "some numerical experiments ( with @xmath66 ) were performed in  @xcite , where the dusty gas model was applied to volcanic eruptions , i.e. a flow with vanishing initial solid density @xmath67 and particles injected into the atmosphere from the volcanic vent .    denoting by s @xmath68 the solid - phase mass - fraction",
    ", we can rewrite the system   with just one flow variable ( @xmath69 ) as follows : @xmath70\\ , ,      \\end{aligned }    \\right.\\ ] ] in the following , we will also assume to have an iso - entropic flow with a perfect gas ( which is a reasonable approximation for the air , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "we can thus substitute the energy equation  ( [ eq : equilibriumeulerian2bis]-d ) by the constitutive law @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the streamline starting at @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( we have not been able to find this expression in the literature ; for its full derivation see  @xcite ) . in particular , a simple calculation shows that @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are motivated by the small density variations compared with a constant temperature ) , we can consequently study the following system ( with @xmath80 ; and @xmath81 are constants determined from the initial conditions ) : @xmath82 here the iso - entropic assumption is justified . indeed , since the reynolds number is typically much greater than 1 , and the prandtl number is of the order of @xmath83 , the two dissipation terms @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( corresponding to the conduction of heat and its dissipation by mechanical energy ) can be neglected . moreover , since @xmath86 and the temperature fluctuations are small , we can disregard the heat transfer from solid to fluid phase .",
    "observe that if @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and if we use the boussinesq approximation , we get from   the following system : @xmath89 which is exactly the boussinesq equations , except that there is no diffusion for the density perturbation ( i.e. , infinite prandtl number ) .",
    "thus , numerical results concerning   are comparable with results from the classical boussinesq equations , see  @xcite .",
    "to validate the eulerian model for multiphase flows  , we use it to perform both dns and les of a dam - break ( lock - exchange ) problem .",
    "since we want to compare our results with accurate results available in the literature , we use a setting which is very close to that in  @xcite , in terms of both equations and initial conditions .",
    "in particular , we consider a two dimensional rectangular domain @xmath90 and @xmath91 with an aspect ratio large enough ( @xmath92 ) in order to obtain high shear across the interface , and to create kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "we use this setting because in a domain with large aspect ratio , the density interface has more space to tilt and stretch .    for this test case ,",
    "the typical velocity magnitude is ( for further details see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the layer thickness and @xmath95 the volumetric fraction of denser material times @xmath94 . from now on , with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the modulus of the gravity acceleration . in our simulation",
    "we set @xmath96 , from which we get @xmath97 we use the characteristic length - scale @xmath98 to non - dimensionalize all the equations in  . in order to have @xmath99 when @xmath100 , we need to set @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , we choose a dimensional system where the initial solid bulk density is @xmath102 , which yields @xmath103 .",
    "the froude number is @xmath104 for all the simulations , so we are free to choose a @xmath105 such that @xmath106 .",
    "we set @xmath107 . in these non - dimensional units ,",
    "the reynolds number is @xmath108 , we set the dynamic viscosity @xmath109 such that the maximum reynolds number we consider is @xmath110 one of the inherent time - scales in the system is the ( brunt - visl ) buoyancy period @xmath111 which is the natural time related to gravity waves . in order to have a quasi - incompressible flow , we set @xmath112 . using our non - dimensional variables , the perfect gas relationship is @xmath113 and the speed of sound is @xmath114 .",
    "we want @xmath115 and @xmath116 , so we set @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "experiments are performed at different resolutions ( from about @xmath119 , up to about @xmath120 grid cells ) , see the next section for details .",
    "the initial condition is a state of rest , in which the fluid with particles on the left is separated from the fluid ( without particles ) on the right by a sharp transition layer .",
    "since the tilting of the density interface puts the system gradually into motion , the system can be started from a state of rest . due to the ( slight ) compressibility of the fluid some peculiar phenomena",
    "occur close to the initial time .",
    "these effects are not present in the incompressible case , cf .  the discussion below .",
    "we consider the isolated problem , so that the iso - entropic approximation is valid and consequently we supplement system   with the following boundary conditions : the boundary condition for the density perturbation @xmath121 is no - flux , while free - slip for the velocity : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the unit outward normal vector , while @xmath124 is a tangential unit vector on @xmath125 . in the two dimensional setting we use for the numerical simulation ( the two dimensional rectangular domain @xmath126-l/2,l/2[\\times]0,h[$ ] ) the boundary conditions",
    "become : @xmath127      we considered as initial datum the classical situation used in the dam - break problem , with all particles confined in the left half of the physical domain ( with uniform distribution ) , while a uniform fluid fills the whole domain .",
    "moreover , we have an initial uniform temperature @xmath128 and pressure distribution @xmath129 . suddenly the wall dividing the two phases is removed and we observe the evolution .",
    "even if our numerical code is compressible , we started with this setting , widely used to study incompressible cases , since we are in the physical regime of quasi - incompressibility .",
    "the compressibility is mostly measured by the mach number . for air we have a typical velocity @xmath130 , hence the mach number of air in this condition is around 0.01 , as we choose for our simulations . on the other hand , for water we would obtain @xmath131 and @xmath132 . nevertheless , as we will see especially in fig .",
    "[ fig : bge ] , even this very small perturbation creates a new instability and new phenomena for times very close to @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , new effects appear for @xmath133 .",
    "these effects seem limited to the beginning of the evolution .",
    "the characteristic time of the stratification ( for a dns ) is defined as ( see  @xcite ) @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the density difference between the ground level and the height @xmath94 of the upper boundary wall . in particular , we know that for the gaseous - phase , the stable solution is the barotropic stratification , due to the gravity acceleration : @xmath136 and in the case of perfect gases we recover the fact that the typical stratification height for the atmosphere ( @xmath137 ) is @xmath138 while for water in the iso - thermal case we would obtain @xmath139 since @xmath16 is small in both cases , we can use the following approximation : @xmath140 for a domain with volume @xmath9 and mass @xmath141 , in the incompressible case the stable stationary configuration is with vanishing velocity and @xmath142 . on the contrary , in our slightly compressible case , the stable stationary configuration is : @xmath143 the length @xmath16 has to be compared with the height of the domain @xmath94 , in order to evaluate the importance of stratification .",
    "for instance , if we use realistic values of density , pressure , and gravity acceleration for air ( to come back to dimensional variables ) we get that the height of the domain is @xmath144 , while for water we get @xmath145 . in the case of air",
    "we obtain density variations due to gravity which are of the order of @xmath146 , while for water they should be of the order of @xmath147 .",
    "this explains that in the case of water , the dominant variations of density , which are of the order of @xmath148 , are those imposed by the initial configuration of particles . on the other hand , in the case of particles in air , the one we are mostly interested to",
    ", the two phenomena create fluctuations which are comparable in magnitude , and this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bge_irreversible ] .",
    "in particular , in fig .  [",
    "fig : bge_irreversible ] , one can see that the fluctuations created by the non - stratified initial condition affect the behavior of the background potential energy defined below . in the case of air",
    ", we have that @xmath149 , and thus the effects of these instabilities ( due to the initial heterogeneity ) will be observed before the mixing effects , which are dominant in the rest of the evolution . on the other hand , this effect can not be seen by analyzing just the mixed fraction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - fraction ] and the discussion below",
    ".    we will also compare the results obtained from dns with those obtained by different les models , as discussed later on .",
    "the accuracy of the les models is evaluated through _ a posteriori _ testing .",
    "the main measure used is the background / reference potential energy ( rpe ) , which represents an appropriate measure for mixing in an enclosed system  @xcite .",
    "rpe is the minimum potential energy that can be obtained through an adiabatic redistribution of the masses . to compute rpe ,",
    "we use directly the approach in  @xcite , since the problem is two - dimensional and computations do not require too much time @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the height of fluid of density @xmath152 in the minimum potential energy state . to evaluate @xmath151 , we use the following formula : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the heaviside function .",
    "it is convenient to use the non - dimensional background potential energy @xmath155 which shows the relative increase of the rpe with respect to the initial state by mixing .",
    "further discussion of the energetics of the dam - break problem can be found in  @xcite .    with these considerations we are now able to compute the maximum particle diameter fulfilling our hypothesis ( @xmath156 ) .",

    "apart from the above les model assessment , we also observe that new important phenomena appear in the compressible case : while in the incompressible case the rpe is monotonically increasing , in our investigation it is initially decreasing , it then reaches a minimum , and it finally starts to increase monotonically , as expected . in order to better understand this phenomenon",

    "evaluating the initial potential energy ( @xmath174 ) , the available energy ( @xmath175 ) , and the background energy ( @xmath176 ) for the homogeneous initial density of the solid - phase , we get : @xmath177 if we consider the initial distribution of fluid and particles in the stratified case , with @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , we get @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the heaviside step function . evaluating the same energies ( as those in  ) for the stratified density distribution considered and using @xmath182 and @xmath183 , we get @xmath184 and also @xmath185 these analytical computations show that the rpe of the stratified state is smaller than that of the homogeneous state . in the next section we will discuss this issue in more detail .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the results of the previous sections with some low - res simulations obtained from the same test case , by using system  , i.e. without the assumption of a barotropic fluid .",
    "the simulations with model   are more time - consuming and so we performed them only at low - res ( simulations with finer mesh resolution are in preparation and their results will appear in the forthcoming report  @xcite ) .",
    "the barotropic assumption is based on the fact that the thermal and kinematic diffusion ( @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) in eq .",

    "indeed , the background energy can be considered as a sort of entropy , measuring the potential energy dispersed in the mixing  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the transformation is reversible allows the background energy to decrease . on the contrary , if we remove this assumption , coming back to the full multiphase model   ( including the energy equation ) , we find that the background energy becomes monotone , see fig .",

    "nevertheless , the barotropic assumption seems justified after the time @xmath189 .",
    "moreover , the stratified initial condition makes the simulation more stable and accurate , but also less diffusive , even at low - res .",

    "the comparison of the results obtained at various resolutions and with different les models for the barotropic and non - barotropic equations deserves further investigation and we plan to perform it in the near future .",
    "we examined a two - dimensional dam - break problem were the instability is due to the presence of a dilute suspension of particles in half of the domain .",

    "the particle concentration is @xmath0 , and the stokes number is smaller than @xmath0 ( fine particles ) .",
    "the importance of stratification , measured as the density gradient times the domain height ( @xmath196 ) , is about a few percent ( @xmath197 ) .",
