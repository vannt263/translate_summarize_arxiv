    "_ `` have you generated any + new random numbers today ? '' + j. kpyaho _",
    "long sequences of random numbers are currently required in numerous applications , in particular within statistical mechanics , particle physics , and applied mathematics .",
    "the methods utilizing random numbers include monte carlo simulation techniques @xcite , stochastic optimization @xcite , and cryptography @xcite , all of which usually require fast and reliable random number sources . in practice , the random numbers needed for these methods are produced by deterministic rules , implemented as _ ( pseudo)random number generator algorithms _ which usually rely on simple aritmethic operations . by their definition , the maximum - length sequences produced by all these algorithms are finite and reproducible , and can thus be `` random '' only in some limited sense @xcite .    despite the importance of creating good pseudorandom number generators ,",
    "fairly little theoretical work exists on random number generation .",
    "thus , the properties of many generators are not well understood in depth .",
    "some random number generator algorithms have been studied in the general context of cellular automata @xcite , and deterministic chaos @xcite . in particular ,",
    "number theory has yielded exact results on the periodicity and lattice structure for linear congruential and tausworthe generators @xcite .",
    "these results have led to theoretical methods of evaluating the algorithms , the most notable being the so called spectral test .",
    "however , most of these theoretical results are derived for the full period of the generator while in practice the behavior of subsequences of substantially shorter lengths is of particular importance in applications .",
    "in addition , the actual implementation of the random number generator algorithm may affect the quality of its output .",
    "thus , _ in situ _ tests of implemented programs are usually needed .    despite this",
    "obvious need for _ in situ _ testing of pseudorandom number generators , only relatively few authors have presented results to this end @xcite .",
    "most likely , there are two main reasons for this .",
    "the first is the persistence of underlying fundamental problems in the actual definitions of `` randomness '' and `` random '' sequences which have given no unique practical recipe for testing a finite sequence of numbers @xcite .",
    "thus various authors have developed an array of different tests which mostly probe some of the statistical properties of the sequences , or test correlations _",
    "e.g. _ on the binary level .",
    "recently , compagner and hoogland @xcite have presented a somewhat more systematic approach to randomness as embodied in finite sequences .",
    "they propose testing the values of all possible correlation coefficients of an ensemble of a given sequence and all of its `` translations '' ( iterated variations ) @xcite , a task which nevertheless appears rather formidable for practical purposes .",
    "we are not aware of any attempts to actually carry out their program .",
    "the second reason is probably more practical , namely the gradual evolution of improved pseudorandom number generator algorithms , which has led to a diversity of generators available in computer software , public domain and so on . for many of these algorithms ( and their implementations ) only a few rudimentary tests",
    "have been performed .    in this work",
    "we have undertaken an extensive test program @xcite of a group of pseudorandom number generators , which are often employed in the applications of physics .",
    "these generators which are described in detail in section 2 include public domain programs ggl , ranmar , ran3 , rcarry and r250 , a library subroutine g05faf , manufacturer installed routines rand and ranf , and even a sequence generated from physical noise ( puran ii ) .",
    "our strategy is to perform a large set of different tests for all of these generators , whose results can then be directly compared with each other .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "namely , there is a difficulty associated with most quantitative tests in the choice of the test parameters and final criteria for judging the results .",
    "thus , we think that full _ comparative _ tests of a large group of generators using _ identical _ test parameters and criteria can yield more meaningful results , in particular when there is a need for a reliable generator with a good overall performance .",
    "second , performing a large number of tests also allows a comparison of exactly how efficient each test is in finding certain kinds of correlations .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , we first employ an array of standard statistical tests , which measure the degree of uniformity of the distribution of numbers , as well as correlations between them . following this",
    ", we perform a series of bit level tests , some of which should be particularly efficient in finding correlations between consecutive bits in the random number sequences .",
    "third part of our testing utilizes visual pictures of random numbers and their bits on a plane .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness we have also included a relative performance test of the generators in our results .",
    "a complete summary of the test results is presented in section 4 .",
    "as our main result we find three generators , namely ggl , g05faf , and r250 with an overall best performance in all our tests , although some other generators such as ranf and ranmar perform almost as convincingly .",
    "we also find that the bit level tests are most efficient in finding local correlations in the random numbers , but do not nevertheless guarantee good statistical properties , as shown in the case of rcarry .",
    "our results also show that visual tests can indeed reveal spatial correlations not clearly detected in the quantitative tests .",
    "our work thus provides a rather comprehensive test bench which can be utilized in choosing a random number generator for a given application .",
    "however , choosing a `` good quality '' random number generator for _ all _ applications may not be trivial as discussed in section 5 , in light of the recent results reporting anomalous correlations in monte carlo simulations @xcite using the here almost impeccably performing r250 .",
    "thus , more physical ways of testing random number sequences are probably needed , a project which is currently underway @xcite .",
    "_ `` the generation of random numbers + is too important to be left to chance . ''",
    "+ r. coveyou _",
    "pseudorandom number sequences needed for high speed applications are usually generated at run time using an algorithm which often is a relatively simple nonlinear deterministic map .",
    "the implementation of the corresponding recurrence relation must also ensure that the stream of numbers is reproducible from identical initial conditions .",
    "the deterministic nature of generation means that the designer has to be careful in the choice of the precise relationship of the recursion , otherwise unwanted correlations will appear as amply demonstrated in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , even the best generator algorithm can be defeated by a poor computer _",
    "whenever an exact mathematical algorithm is translated into a computer subroutine , different possibilities for its implementation may exist . only if the operation of a generator can be exactly specified on the binary level ,",
    "has the implementation a chance to be unambiguous ; otherwise , machine dependent features become incorporated into the routine .",
    "these include finite precision of real numbers , limited word size of the computer , and numerical accuracy of mathematical functions .",
    "furthermore , it would often be desirable that the implemented routine performed identically in each environment in which it is to be executed , _",
    "i.e. _ it would be _",
    "portable_.    some of the desired properties of good pseudorandom number generators are easily defined but often difficult to achieve simultaneously .",
    "namely , besides good `` randomness '' properties portability , repeatability , performance speed , and a very long period are often required .",
    "ideally , a random number generator would be designed for each application , and then tested _ within that application _ to ensure that the inevitable correlations that do exist in a deterministic algorithm , cause no observable effects . in practice , this is seldom possible , which is another reason why extensive tests of pseudorandom number generators are needed .",
    "most commonly used pseudorandom number generator algorithms are the _ linear congruential method _ , the _ lagged fibonacci method _ , the _ shift register method _ , and _ combination methods_. a special case are nonalgorithmic or _ physical generators _ which are used for creating a non - reproducible sequence of random numbers .",
    "these are usually based on `` random '' physical events , _",
    "e.g. _ changes in physical characteristics of devices , cosmic ray bursts or electromagnetic interference .",
    "details and properties of the algorithms will be summarized in the next section . following this",

    "marsaglia @xcite pointed out about 20 years ago that the random numbers in @xmath17 dimensions lie on a relatively small number of parallel hyperplanes .",
    "further theoretical work @xcite has been done to weed out bad choices of the constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 but so far no consensus has evolved on a unique best choice for these parameters .    to increase the period of the linear congruential algorithm , it is natural to generalize it to the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the period is the smallest positive integer @xmath21 for which @xmath22 since there are @xmath23 possible @xmath24tuples , the maximum period is @xmath25 . in this category",
    "the simplest algorithm is of the _ fibonacci type_. the use of @xmath26 leads to the fibonacci generator @xmath27 since no multiplications are involved , this implementation has the advantage of being fast .",
    "a _ lagged fibonacci _",
    "generator requires an initial set of elements @xmath28 and then uses the integer recursion @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two integer lags satisfying @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a binary operation ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( exclusive - or ) ) .",

    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative generator type is the _ shift register generator_. feedback shift register generators are also sometimes called tausworthe generators @xcite .",
    "the feedback shift register algorithm is based on the theory of primitive trinomials of the form @xmath40 .",
    "given such a primitive trinomial and @xmath41 binary digits @xmath42 , a binary shift register sequence can be generated by the following recurrence relation : @xmath43 where @xmath37 is the exclusive - or operator , which is equivalent to addition modulo 2 .",
    "@xmath44-bit vectors can be formed from bits taken from this binary sequence as @xmath45 where @xmath17 is a chosen delay between elements of this binary vector .",
    "the resulting binary vectors are then treated as random numbers .",
    "such a generated sequence of random integers will have the maximum possible period of @xmath46 , if @xmath40 is a primitive trinomial and if this trinomial divides @xmath47 for @xmath48 , but for no smaller @xmath49 .",

    "generators based on small values of @xmath41 do not perform well on the tests @xcite . according to some statistical tests on computers @xcite the value of @xmath50 should be small or close to @xmath51 .",

    "the words @xmath53 satisfy the recurrence relation : @xmath54 under special conditions , maximal period length of @xmath55 can be achieved .",
    "lewis and payne @xcite and niederreiter @xcite have also studied the properties of the algorithm theoretically .",
    "an important aspect of the gfsr algorithm concerns its initialization , where @xmath41 initial seeds are required .",
    "this question has been studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the inevitable dependencies that will exist in a pseudorandom sequence , it seems natural that one should try to _ shuffle _ a sequence @xcite or to _ combine _ separate sequences .",
    "an example of such approach is given by maclaren and marsaglia @xcite who were apparently the first to suggest the idea of combining two generators together to produce a single sequence of random numbers .",
    "the essential idea is that if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two random number sequences , then the sequence @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 will not only be more uniform than either of the two sequences but will also be more independent .",
    "algorithms using this idea are often called _ mixed _ or _ combination _ generators . as mentioned before , _",
    "physical devices _ have also been used in the creation of random number sequences .",
    "usually , however , such sequences are generated too slowly to be used in real time , but rather stored in the computer memory where they can be easily accessed .",
    "this also guarantees the reproducability of the chosen sequence in applications .",
    "however , physical memory restrictions often severely limit the number of stored numbers .",
    "unwanted and unknown physical correlations may also affect the quality of physical random numbers . as a result , physical random numbers have not been commonly used in simulations .",

    "a fundamental problem in testing finite pseudorandom number sequences stems from the fact that the definition of randomness for such sequences is not unique @xcite .",
    "thus , one usually has to decide upon some criteria which test at least the most fundamental properties that such sequences should possess , such as correct values of the moments of their probability distribution .",
    "this has lead to the emergence of a large number of tests which can be divided into three approximate categories : _ statistical ( or traditional ) tests _ for testing random numbers in real or integer representation , _ bit level tests _ for binary representations of random numbers , and more phenomenological _ visual tests_. in this work , we have employed several tests belonging to each of these categories , as will be discussed below .",

    "kirkpatrick and stoll @xcite further argue that as all columns of bits generated by a gfsr(@xmath194 ) generator have the same statistical characteristics , their results of this test should apply to any subset of bits in a random number sequence produced by this generator .",
