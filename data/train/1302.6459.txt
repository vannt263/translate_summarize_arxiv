    "in the context of finite element methods ( fem ) there exist two main ways of improving the numerical accuracy .",
    "first , a computational mesh on which a problem is approximated can be refined ( @xmath1-refinement ) .",
    "secondly , the order @xmath2 of the approximating polynomials can be increased ( @xmath2-refinement ) .",
    "both strategies , their combinations ( @xmath3-refinement ) and their connection to the level of regularity of the solutions have been extensively studied ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "even higher accuracy can be obtained by applying problem - specific high order basis functions .",
    "we pursue this approach in the framework of the discontinuous galerkin finite element methods ( dg - fem ) @xcite , as it allows an almost unrestricted choice of bases .",
    "to date , there exist only few works on dg and dg - type methods using a problem specific basis in the frequency - domain , in particular the ultra weak variational formulation ( uwvf )  @xcite and the plane wave discontinuous galerkin method ( pwdg )  @xcite which has been shown to be a generalization of the former one . in the time - domain , we are aware of  @xcite only",
    ". however , this approach differs significantly from our work as will be detailed below . most commonly however , generic polynomials are employed , which does not lead to the optimal approximation accuracy for a given polynomial order and mesh size .    in this article",
    "we present a highly accurate type of dg - fem for time - domain applications .",
    "a distinguishing new attribute of the method is the use of trefftz - type basis functions  @xcite , which , by definition , exactly satisfy the underlying partial differential equations and the respective interface boundary conditions in an element - wise fashion .",
    "the method is , hence , a discontinuous galerkin trefftz finite element method ( dgt - fem ) .",
    "we consider space- and time - dependent equations .",
    "as trefftz functions are required to solve the equations exactly , at least in a local sense , they necessarily have to depend on time as well .",
    "consequently , the dgt - fem has to be formulated as a space - time fem  @xcite . in a space - time method",
    "there is no formal distinction between the spatial dimensions and the temporal one .",
    "finite element spaces are given as @xmath4-dimensional functional spaces , where @xmath5 denotes the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "working in a space - time setting has two immediate implications : first , high order time integration is obtained in a straightforward and consistent manner by increasing the order of the approximating polynomials , and second , convergence rates describe the approximation error not only in space but in space - time .",
    "it is shown below that spectral convergence of the global approximation error in the space - time domain of interest is obtained under @xmath2-enrichment for sufficiently smooth data .",
    "this is in contrast to dg methods based on a discretization of space , where spectral convergence is attained with respect to the spatial discretization error only .",
    "we also show that the presence of inhomogeneous elements ( i.e elements filled with different materials ) does not affect the convergence rate if an appropriate local trefftz basis is used .    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model-1d ] we derive the weak space - time dg formulation of time - dependent electromagnetic waves . the derivation is restricted to the @xmath6-dimensional case . a generalization to higher spatial dimensions",
    "is outlined below and will be implemented in the near future . section  [ sec : trefftz - approximations ] introduces the space - time trefftz basis functions that by necessity have to be vector - valued , with the electric and magnetic field as components .",
    "trefftz bases are derived for homogeneously filled grid cells as well as for partially filled cells containing two different materials .",
    "results obtained from numerical experiments are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "first , we demonstrate the physical correctness of the results .",
    "then we investigate the convergence rates of the method both in space and time . finally , we show that the method outperforms well - established methods such as the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) and the dg method with leapfrog time stepping ( dgl ) in terms of efficiency .",
    "section  [ sec : outlook ] concludes the paper and provides an outlook to the ongoing work of extending the method to higher dimensions in space .",
    "this section contains a derivation of a weak space - time dg formulation of maxwell s equations using vectorial basis functions .",
    "the resulting equations describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in one spatial dimension .",

    "in contrast to most approaches , we are interested in employing trefftz bases rather than the standard piecewise - polynomial approximations .",
    "however , in this part of the derivation we keep a general form of basis functions and implement the trefftz basis in section  [ sec : trefftz - approximations ] .",
    "once a set of basis functions over the cell is chosen , the integral over @xmath58 directly leads to the entries of the stiffness matrices @xmath59 @xmath60 on the element level , the treatment of the integrals over the element boundary @xmath61 is more nuanced than in the global problem .",
    "these integrals represent surface fluxes that in the continuous problem must be the same for any two adjacent grid cells . in dg methods basis and",
    "test functions are defined with a strictly element - wise compact support .",
    "therefore , the approximation is continuous within each element but discontinuous across any cell interfaces . at the interfaces",

    "flux continuity can be numerically imposed via a penalty term or , as is commonly done in dg methods , by combining weighted numerical approximations of each flux in the two adjacent cells .",

    "trefftz basis functions are a set of problem - specific functions , which satisfy the underlying partial differential equations exactly within a grid cell .",
    "as they include features of the exact solution , trefftz methods often yield very accurate numerical solutions . in this section",
    "we construct a trefftz basis for electromagnetic wave propagation problems as stated in section  [ sec : model-1d ] .",
    "for some scenarios , such as the propagation of a plane wave in a vacuum , trefftz basis functions are relatively easy to construct  @xcite .",
    "however , we also address the case of partially filled elements , where the derivation of locally exact functions is more involved .      in the following we apply maxwell s equations   in natural units , with the permittivity and permeability of vacuum set to one .",
    "as a consequence , the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath78 , is one as well .",

    "traveling waves of the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an arbitrary sufficiently smooth function and @xmath82 the local speed of light , are well known to be solutions of the wave equation .",

    "we note that using separate scalar bases for approximating the electric and magnetic field individually does not yield a trefftz method .",
    "any individual basis function or a combination of them has to solve the governing equations . in the two field formulation that we apply , this is not guaranteed with separate scalar basis functions as can easily be seen by inserting transport polynomials of order @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 into ( [ eqn:1d - maxwell ] ) .",

    "a reconstruction procedure that ensures point wise inter element continuity is used to define the element average , which is unnatural in the context of dg methods and makes the implementation of material interfaces much harder , if possible at all in higher dimensions .",
    "inter - element continuity is weakly imposed by means of lagrange multipliers instead of numerical fluxes .",
    "apart from being an unusual approach within a dg method , the multipliers are additional degrees of freedom , which have to be solved for .      in the following",

    "what remains is to find these waveforms at an arbitrary position @xmath7 rather than just at @xmath109 .",
    "we therefore express the outgoing waveforms in terms of the incoming waveform which yields @xmath110 for the reflected waves and @xmath111 for the transmitted waves . here",
