    "magnetic quantum phase transitions , where the threshold of magnetism can be reached at low temperature , guide towards new ordering phenomena in metals . while examples of quantum phase transitions and of the associated quantum critical behavior abound in 4__f__-electron metals , such as the heavy fermion ce- and yb - compounds,@xcite comparatively few transition metal compounds have been studied in detail . among these are the nearly or weakly ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials mnsi , ni@xmath9al",

    "the most thoroughly studied example is chromium and its alloy series with vanadium , in which signatures of fermi liquid ( fl)@xcite breakdown have been observed at the quantum critical composition cr@xmath12v@xmath13.@xcite recently , we have reported anomalous temperature dependences of the heat capacity and of the electrical resistivity in slightly off - stoichiometric nbfe@xmath14.@xcite positioned very close to the threshold of magnetism at ambient pressure and stoichiometric composition , nbfe@xmath14  may provide fresh opportunities in this long - standing problem .    the c14 laves phase system nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  exhibits three magnetically ordered low temperature states within a narrow composition range at ambient pressure . at slightly off - stoichiometric compositions , both towards the iron - rich and the niobium - rich side , it has been reported to be ferromagnetic at low temperature , with composition - dependent , low transition temperatures @xmath11 of the order of tens of kelvin .",
    "moreover , at and very close to the stoichiometric composition , nbfe@xmath14  has been reported to assume antiferromagnetic or spin density wave ( sdw ) order below a second transition temperature @xmath15.@xcite the easy accessibility of these ordered states in a nearly stoichiometric compound presents a number of interesting opportunities for studies of quantum phase transitions and quantum criticality in a transition metal compound .",
    "firstly , it may be possible to examine ferromagnetic quantum criticality by tuning @xmath11 towards absolute zero .",
    "this requires starting with a niobium - rich sample and either changing the composition or applying hydrostatic pressure . in iron - rich samples ,",
    "ferromagnetism transforms into the presumed spin density wave state on approaching stoichiometry .",
    "the precise nature of this non - ferromagnetic ordered phase in nearly stoichiometric nbfe@xmath14 , and the associated quantum critical phenomena , represent a second area of interest .",
    "finally , the intermediate composition ranges , at which ferromagnetism is replaced by the non - ferromagnetic order characteristic of stoichiometric nbfe@xmath14  invite detailed investigation .    past studies of the nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  system have explored the composition - temperature phase diagram in polycrystals by magnetic measurements and by nuclear magnetic resonance.@xcite while in broad agreement , these studies differ in their classification of the slightly niobium - rich region of the phase diagram .",
    "the former ( ref .",
    "13 ) describes the region around @xmath16 as paramagnetic down to @xmath17 , whereas the latter ( ref .",
    "14 ) reports a mixed ( fm and sdw ) phase .",
    "further microscopic probes have been mbauer spectroscopy , muon spin relaxation ( @xmath18sr ) and neutron scattering studies .",
    "while @xmath18sr has shown evidence of static moments in stoichiometric nbfe@xmath14 , neutron scattering has so far not revealed any information about the nature of this magnetic order in nbfe@xmath14 . here , we reexamine the magnetic phase diagram of nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  in well - characterized high - quality samples .",
    "we aim to address key questions thrown up by earlier studies : ( i ) are both fm phases previously observed truly belonging to the c14 phase of nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  or is the ferromagnetism due to the presence of a fm second phase;@xcite ( ii ) which is then the real origin of the sdw order ; ( iii ) how does the sdw state grow out of the fm state ; ( iv ) does the antiferromagnetism disappear in slightly nb - rich samples , and , if so , ( v ) is there a qcp ?",
    "most measurements in previous studies,@xcite were carried out on polycrystalline samples of nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  prepared by arc - melting , followed by annealing for one week at @xmath19 .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction was used to check for phase purity and to determine the lattice parameters , from which the composition was estimated .    since c14-nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  crystallizes in a broad homogeneity range from 27.4 to 36.3 at.@xmath20 nb at @xmath21 , and because the magnetic properties are very sensitive to @xmath22 , it is important to verify not only the structure but also the final composition .",
    "we decided , therefore , to prepare samples in the range from 26 to 40 at.% nb , covering the whole homogeneity range of the c14 phase , with two similar methods ( indicated as method a and b in table  [ tab : table1 ] ) accompanied by characterization with x - ray powder diffraction , metallographic analysis , and wavelength and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wdxs and edxs ) .     and @xmath23 in tab .",

    "the measurements performed at low magnetic field ( 100  oe ) allow to detect the presence of fm phases ( @xmath24  k ) in the upper slice sample in addition to the expected sdw peak ( @xmath25  k ) . comparing this measurement with the micrograph shown in the inset",

    "method a : pellets with a mass of @xmath27 were prepared by arc melting from pure niobium ( h. c. starck , granules , @xmath28 ) and iron ( chempur , foil , @xmath29 ) on a water - cooled copper hearth in an argon atmosphere . in order to assure homogeneity ,",
    "the pellets were turned over and remelted several times .",
    "the pellets were subsequently enclosed in weld - sealed niobium ampoules which were in turn jacketed in quartz tubes , and annealed at @xmath21 for three weeks .",

    "the structure type of the second phase was confirmed for the sample at the composition nb@xmath37fe@xmath38 ( see tab .  [",

    "the actual composition of this phase could not be accurately determined due to its small grain size .",
    "it is plausible that in a sample with a large amount of this nb - rich second phase the c14 main phase will be fe - rich .",
    "this argument may explain the difference in lattice parameters between the samples with @xmath39 and @xmath23 , which were both extracted from the same ingot .",
    "the main difference between the two methods emerged in the metallographic analysis : while the first method resulted in high homogeneity in all regions of the final pellet with very small isolated filaments of the ti@xmath14ni - like phase , the second method produced drastic differences in homogeneity between the upper and the lower zone inside the pellet .",
    "the zone with almost no extra phases appears to be the middle of the pellet .    after having cut the samples into horizontal slices , we ground and polished them carefully ( in two steps ) and observed the surface with a high resolution optical microscope .",
    "the inset in fig .",

    "the phase can be seen clearly near the c14-nbfe@xmath14  grain boundaries , which have dimensions of about @xmath40 .",
    "afterwards , we measured the ac - susceptibility at low magnetic fields ( @xmath41 ) of samples extracted from the upper and the middle slice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample4b_p4 ] ) : in the upper slice , we observed a fm signal with a transition temperature @xmath42 , in addition to the expected sdw peak at @xmath43 . in the middle slice ,",
    "only the sdw signature is present . comparing these measurements with the metallographic analysis",
    ", we conclude that the second phase is responsible for the fm part of the signal . repeating the same procedure with different samples",
    ", we observed that @xmath44 is different in every sample , varying from 250  k to 15  k. it probably depends on the real nb concentration at the grain boundaries .",
    "looking at the nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) , this hypothesis makes sense because the nb - rich region is fm and the transition temperature varies strongly with the quantity of nb . in magnetic fields",
    "higher than 250  oe these fm features disappear .",
    "it is therefore necessary to evaluate the quality of any sample by not only measuring the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) , but also the ac - susceptibility in zero magnetic field .",
    "the lattice parameters of all polycrystals are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] , together with the initial nominal compositions , wdxs results and transition temperatures .",
    "the discrepancy between the values of our lattice parameters for nbfe@xmath14  and those reported in literature is less than 0.001 .@xcite the measurements that we are going to present have been performed on a selected number of polycrystals , which show none or at most very low presence of the second phase .",
    "[ fig : volume ] shows the average volume per atom of the c14 structure versus the nominal ( solid line ) and wdxs ( dashed line ) nb content .",
    "the final composition of most samples , as determined by wdxs , is slightly richer in nb than the nominal composition . in the range from 28 to 34 at.@xmath20 nb , a linear dependence of the atomic volume on composition determined by wdxs according to vegard s volume is observed . around the upper border of the homogeneity range ( @xmath45  at.% nb )",
    ", the sample composition could not be determined accurately by wdxs , probably because of the large amount of the second phase . using the relation @xmath46 obtained by a least - squares fit of the data",
    ", we can determine the composition of a sample by measuring the lattice parameters .",
    "this is especially useful for detecting small differences in composition that are difficult to observe using wdxs .",
    "the accuracy in the wdxs experiments is of the order of @xmath47 limiting the accuracy on @xmath22 to @xmath48 .",
    "we note that a small systematic error of about 0.2 at.@xmath20 can not be ruled out .",
    "however , this error would only shift the absolute value without changing the shape of the phase diagram",
    ".      measurements of the resistivity , heat capacity , magnetization and magnetic susceptibility down to 1.8  k have been carried out in a 9  t physical properties measurements system and in a 7  t magnetic properties measurements system ( quantum design ) .",
    "high - resolution measurements of the resistivity at temperatures down to 50  mk were obtained in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( cambridge magnetic refrigeration ) by a standard 4-terminal lock - in technique .",
    "the low temperature heat capacity was determined in the same refrigerator by a relaxation - time technique .    due to the low molar specific heat of nbfe@xmath14  compared to that of heavy fermion compounds ( @xmath49 mj / kmol at 1  k ) , and due to the low sample mass of @xmath50 , we had to assemble a particular platform for measuring the heat capacity with high resolution : we used sapphire single - crystals of 6 mm diameter and @xmath51 m thickness held mechanically by four pt@xmath52ir@xmath53 wires , which provide a well defined thermal link with a thermal conductance @xmath54 at 1  k ; this configuration provides relaxation time constants of about @xmath55 s. details of the heat capacity setup will be described in a forthcoming article .",

    "order.@xcite they are still in the c14 homogeneity range and the amount of the second phase appears to be negligible .",
    "our results confirm that both nb- and fe - rich nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  are fm , and indicate that the two ferromagnetically ordered states are different in character .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] shows the dc magnetic susceptibility of the two samples measured at 50  oe .",
    "clear jumps in magnetization are observed at @xmath58  k and @xmath59  k for the fe - rich and the nb - rich sample respectively . when increasing the external field , the transition temperature remains practically constant , suggesting that the ferromagnetism is not a consequence of the second phase .",
    "in addition , hysteresis signatures are evident in both samples , as shown in the inset of the same figure .",
    "although in both samples the remanent magnetizations are very small , of the order of @xmath60 per atom , the coercive fields are quite large : 200  oe and 700  oe .",
    "with increasing nb excess the coercive field of nb - rich samples decreases to a value that is not detectable anymore by the measurement technique , as in the case of soft magnets : the arrott plot for sample @xmath61 ( @xmath62  k ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrott2k ] at 2  k does not show any hysteresis , although the finite @xmath63 intercept for zero @xmath64 is a clear indication of a remanent magnetization and hence of ferromagnetism .",
    "for very slight nb doping , @xmath65 , no fm signal has been observed down to 2  k and also the arrott plot suggests a pm groundstate .    on the fe - rich side , all samples exhibited large hysteresis ( see inset of fig .  [",

    "the heat capacity is less sensitive to the magnetic transition and so the weak anomaly that was observed in the stoichiometric sample at 10  k , has not yet been observed in either nb - rich sample .",
    "the surprisingly high value of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath158 at low temperature for all the samples close to the stoichiometric composition has been considered as indication of the presence of strong spin fluctuations and of the vicinity of the system to a qcp.@xcite approaching the qcp by increasing the nb - content , @xmath158 gradually increases and , for @xmath65 , it follows a logarithmic temperature dependence down to about @xmath159 ( fig .",

    "magnetoresistance measurements below @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_676 ] ) suggest that nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  does not have a paramagnetic ground state at @xmath65 . a little drop ( less than 1@xmath20 ) in @xmath125",
    "is observed at 2  k and clear hysteresis phenomena develop below @xmath168 .",
    "this indicates the presence of very weak sdw order below @xmath169 , which develops domains at @xmath170 .",
    "these findings contrast with our observations on a high quality nb - rich ( @xmath171 ) single crystal , in which non - fermi liquid phenomena have been observed down to the lowest temperature.@xcite despite residual low - temperature order below @xmath172 , presumably with a very small ordered moment , the resistance of the single crystal follows a @xmath173 power law down to @xmath174 , and its heat capacity coefficient @xmath175 increases logarithmically with decreasing temperature , without any indication of a crossover to a fl state .",
    "the return of our nb - rich polycrystal with @xmath65 to fl behavior at low temperature , when such a return to fl behavior is not observed in a single crystal with a similar composition , may be attributed to the lower quality of the polycrystal either in terms of its purity or its homogeneity .",
    "we interpret these findings as the first clear indication of a logarithmic breakdown of the fermi - liquid state in a transition metal antiferromagnet : the fact that the precise power - law exponent varies between 3/2 and 5/3 and the discrepancies between the phenomena observed in single and polycrystals suggest that the precise form of @xmath84 may depend on stoichiometry and on the sample orientation and that present data can not decide whether fm or sdw spin fluctuations determine the low temperature behavior .",
    "we propose a refined version of the magnetic phase diagram for nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] ) , obtained by combining all the thermodynamic and transport measurements discussed in this paper .",
    "dashed lines indicate the likely limits of the fm and sdw state .",
    "we can address the five questions outlined in the introduction with the help of this phase diagram .    for @xmath176 , distinct fm phases have been observed at low temperature .",
    "our data confirm that the fm features do not originate from an impurity phase , but are intrinsic to the c14 laves phase nb@xmath0fe@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath177 isotherms are qualitatively different in the fe - rich and nb - rich fm phases , suggesting that the two states are of a different nature .    between the fm phases ,",
    "a distinct non - fm phase has been observed : susceptibility , magnetization , resistivity and heat capacity results , many of which are similar to observations in well - known spin helical compounds such as mnau@xmath3,@xcite y@xmath3fe@xmath178@xcite and mnsi,@xcite suggest that the magnetic order in stoichiometric nbfe@xmath14  assumes the form of a sdw , possibly a long wavelength helical or spiral state . on the fe - rich side , we believe that the sdw state with a small wave vector @xmath135 connects continuously to the fm state at the lifshitz point , which is located around @xmath7.@xcite the schematic fig .  [ fig : fmafm3a ] shows the possible evolution of the wave vector dependent generalised susceptibility @xmath179 , as nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  is tuned away from the lifshitz point : with decreasing iron content @xmath22 the minimum shifts from @xmath180 to low @xmath181 , and nb@xmath0fe@xmath1  changes from fm to long - wavelength sdw order .",
    "the small value of the @xmath182 intercept at @xmath180 would explain the high value of the measured ac - susceptibility at low temperature . assuming that the dispersion stiffness value of nbfe@xmath14  is similar to the one measured in zrzn@xmath14 , we could estimate an ordering wave vector of about 0.05 @xmath5 for nbfe@xmath14.@xcite until the precise nature of the sdw state can be observed using a microscopic probe , ideally neutron scattering , this scenario remains strongly hypothetical .",
    "alternative origins of the dual nature of nbfe@xmath14   nearly ferromagnetic and yet antiferromagnetic  include ( i ) coincidental peaks of the wave vector dependent susceptibility at large wave vector ( sdw ) and at @xmath180 ( fm ) and ( ii ) a very weakly dispersive wave vector dependent susceptibility @xmath179 , peaking at a large , antiferromagnetic wave vector but remaining unusually large even at @xmath180 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on recently grown , large single crystals of nbfe@xmath14  are planned , and will hopefully help to resolve this controversy .    once the sdw state is entered , sdw domains form with different order parameter polarizations or ordering wavevector directions , creating a set of domain walls .",
    "a weak magnetic field @xmath108 is sufficient to destroy the sdw and induce a weakly spin - aligned paramagnetic state .",
    "the transition in @xmath108 from helical to the paramagnetic state probably occurs through a number of successive steps , which are linked with domain wall jumps and define the size of the hysteresis .",
    "we are planning to investigate this interpretation by high precision measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization and of the electrical resistivity at very low temperatures . by reducing the fe content ( for small negative @xmath22 ) ,",
    "the sdw state can be suppressed completely , leading to a magnetic quantum critical point and leaving a small paramagnetic region around @xmath183 . here",
    ", magnetic fluctuations dominate the temperature dependence of resistivity and specific heat .",
    "since the critical exponents fall in between those expected for fm and sdw spin fluctuations and the qcp is located between the two different phases , the nature of the fluctuations requires clarification .",
