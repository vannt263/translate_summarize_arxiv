    "no doubt , @xmath0 centauri is the most - studied and the most - enigmatic among the milky way satellites . for long times",
    "it has been considered a globular cluster , but a number of peculiarities , like the mass , the chemical composition , the stellar content and the kinematics , suggest that it might be the remnant of a larger stellar system ( bekki & freeman 2003 , lee et al .  2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "great interest and great efforts have been dedicated to this object , since the discovery that its stars span a wide range of metallicities , including iron - peak elements ( cannon & stobie 1973 , freeman & rodgers 1975 , johnson et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .    with the advent of wide - field imagers and thanks to the increasingly high - photometric precision in the densest cluster regions ,",
    "new discoveries revived the interest in @xmath0  cen , and surely complicated the already inexplicable enigma represented by its composite stellar population .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and pancino et al.(2000 ) announced that its red giant branch ( rgb ) resolves into several distinct stellar sequences .",
    "anderson ( 1997 ) found that , over a range of about two magnitudes , the main sequence ( ms ) splits into a blue ( bms ) and a red sequence ( rms ) .",
    "the result has been confirmed by bedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who discovered a third , less populated ms ( ms - a ) on the red side of the rms ( see also villanova et al .  2007 , hereafter v07 ) .",
    "a totally unexpected discovery came from the spectroscopic analysis by piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who revealed that the bms is more metal - rich than the rms .",
    "only greatly - enhanced helium can explain the color and metallicity difference between the two mss .",
    "bellini et al.(2009 ) ( see also sollima et al .  2007 ) , found that bms stars are more centrally concentrated than rms ones , with a bms over rms ratio ranging from @xmath11.0 ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 ) to @xmath10.40 ( @xmath2@xmath58@xmath6 ) .                        perhaps , the most complex region of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) .",
    "photometric studies showed that the sgb of @xmath0  cen is split into 4 , possibly 5 , distinct stellar populations ( lee et al .",
    "2005 , sollima et al.2005 , v07 ) .    in this work we present high - accuracy photometry obtained with both the _ wide field camera 3 _ ( wfc3 ) in the _ uv - optical _ channel ( uvis ) , and the _ wide field channel _ of the _ advanced camera for survey _",
    "( wfc / acs ) of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "not surprisingly , we obtained astonishingly complex cmds unveiling a number of new details which make the @xmath0  cen stellar population more complex than ever shown , making the the understanding of the star formation history in this cluster a real challenge .",
    "the purpose of this work is just to present to the astronomical community these new cmds , discuss their detailed morphology  with the hope of adding important information and a deeper insight into @xmath0  cen  and help to add up all the pieces of what still remains a broken puzzle . the multi - band astro - photometric catalog presented in this work",
    "will be publicly available to the astronomical community , for further analysis .",
    "for calibration purposes , @xmath0  cen has been observed many times with _ hst _ , using a huge variety of filters .",
    "recent observations were collected with the newly installed wfc3 . in september 9@xmath7 2009 , a set of well - dithered exposures through the broad - band ultraviolet ( uv ) filters f225w , f275w , and f336w were released to the community .",
    "the data were collected in july 15 , 2009 , for general calibration purposes ( pid-11452 ) .",
    "the portion of the data that we used in this paper consists of 9 exposures , each of 350 s , for each filter .",
    "the archive images were standard pipe - line pre - reduced flt , and we measured star positions and fluxes with a software mostly based on img2xym_wfi ( anderson et al .",
    "details on this software will be presented in a stand - alone paper .",
    "star positions and fluxes have been corrected for geometric distortion and pixel - area using the geometric distortion solution provided by bellini & bedin ( 2009 ) , and calibrated as in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "we complement these uv data with the optical photometry obtained with the acs / wfc in the filters f435w , f625w , f658n , f606w , and f814w .",
    "details on these data sets and their photometry can be found in v07 , and anderson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "since we are focused on high - accuracy photometry , this work only concerns relatively isolated stars with small photometric and astrometric errors , and high psf - fit quality .",
    "a detailed description of the selection procedures adopted in this paper is given in milone et al .",
    "finally , we corrected our photometry for both reddening variations in the field of view ( fov ) and spatial - dependent photometric errors , introduced by small variations of the psf shape , which are not accounted for in our psf models . with this aim",
    ", we used a method similar to that used by sarajedini et al.(2007 ) and milone et al .",
    "briefly , we determined the average ms ridge line ( rl ) for each cmd and then we analyzed the color residuals as a function of the position within the fov .",
    "we corrected the effect of spatial photometric variations suffered by each star by computing the average color residuals from the ms rl of its 50 well - measured neighbors , and by correcting the star color by this amount .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a collection of cmds from multi - band wfc3/uvis and acs / wfc photometry .",
    "all cmds encompass all the evolutionary sequences , from faint ms stars , down to a well developed white dwarf ( wd ) cooling sequence ( cs , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . a close view of these cmds is sufficient to realize that each of them is a mine of information on the stellar content of @xmath0  cen . a model - based interpretation of these cmds is severely complicated by the heterogeneity of the composition of each sequence and by possible age differences , and requires a very accurate analysis , which is beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "many of the features that we observe in these cmds are well known , and widely studied . for completeness of information , and in order to make the following discussion clearer to the reader , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) the cmd resulting from the @xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 mosaic of acs images centered on the cluster center , that was already analyzed in several papers ( bedin et al .",

    "2009 , and dantona , caloi , & ventura 2010 ) .",
    "the high accuracy of the acs photometry already revealed a large number of evolutionary sequences in the cmd .",

    "[ fig2 ] to highlight the four main sgbs and the triple ms , following the notation of v07 .    in the following",
    ", we will focus our attention on a number of details in the cmd that can be revealed for the first time by the high - accuracy multi - band photometry presented in this paper .",
    "the new , multi - band data set provided by wfc3 , combined with the acs data , open a new observational window also on the complex main sequence of @xmath0  cen .    the wide color base - line of the @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 cmd plotted on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] allows us to isolate the two groups of bms and rms stars indicated by blue and red color - coded regions .",
    "similarly , we can select a sample of ms - a stars from the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 cmd where the ms - a is most clearly separated from the remaining mss of @xmath0  cen .",
    "selected stars are highlighted in green on the right panel cmd of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "we have high - accuracy photometric measurements in eight bands , which allow us to plot seven distinct cmds involving the f814w band . for each of them",
    ", we plotted @xmath10 magnitudes as a function of the @xmath14 color , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show the three most representative of these cmds ( zoomed around the ms region ) .",
    "we assigned to each star a blue , red or green color code according to whether it belongs to the bms , rms , or ms - a sample , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we overimposed to the observed cmds the ms rls corresponding to the three mss , extracted from the cmd using the method described in milone et al .  (",
    "briefly , we divided the cmd in intervals of 0.2 magnitudes in the f814w band and calculated for each of them the median color and magnitude for the bms , rms , and ms - a stars .",
    "we fitted these median points with a spline and obtained a first guess for the ms rl .",
    "then , we calculated the difference between the color of each star and the color of the ms rl corresponding to magnitude of the star , and we took as @xmath21 the @xmath22 percentile of the absolute value of the color difference .",
    "we rejected all stars with color differences larger than @xmath23 , and we recalculated the median points .",
    "the rls for the three mss are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the seven cmds analyzed in this section .",
    "we note a few interesting features : ( i ) the rls of the bms and the ms - a are nearly parallel in all the cmds in the magnitude range @xmath24 , while the rl of the rms have a different slope ; ( ii ) when using @xmath25 and @xmath26 colors the rl of the ms - a seems to intercept ( or merge with ) the rms going from the brightest to the faintest stars .",
    "ms - a stars become even bluer than the rms ones in the @xmath27 color .",
    "this is the most intriguing cmd , in the context of the he content :  he abundance affects the color of ms stars .",
    "the f658n filter maps essentially the h@xmath28 feature , with a very small influence by other elements .",
    "it measures the strength of the h@xmath28 which , for ms stars cooler than 8000 k , is a function of the t@xmath29 , but also of the hydrogen content , if it is allowed to vary .",
    "ms - a stars are more metal rich than rms stars , being the progenitors of sgb - d and of the rgb - a ( pancino et al .",
    "2002 , v07 ) .",
    "for this reason , the fact that ms - a stars become even bluer than the rms in the @xmath27 color , overlapping with the bms , might imply that also ms - a is enriched in he ( as suggested by norris 2004 ) .",
    "in fact , he enhancement tends to move the ms to bluer colors .",
    "the shape of the the ms - a , parallel to the bms , might be also an indication that its stars are he enriched .",
    "however , we also know that the ms - a has higher iron content than the bms .",
    "higher metallicity implies redder ms colors .",
    "it is a combination of different metal abundances , including cno , and he content which results in the observed behavior of the ms - a color .",
    ", plotted as a function of the central wavelength of the @xmath30 filter . ]    in order to quantify the color differences among the three mss as a function of the color baseline , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plotted the central wavelength @xmath31 of the @xmath30 filter versus the measured color - difference @xmath32(color ) of both bms stars ( blue points ) and ms - a stars ( green points ) , with respect to the rms rl color , at @xmath33 ( this magnitude level is also indicated with an horizontal line in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] are listed in table  [ deltacolor ] .",
    "a visual inspection of the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 cmd of fig .  [ fig7 ] suggests that the rms is broadened . in this section",
    "we will investigate the possible presence of this intrinsic color spread among rms stars , by using the same approach followed in the recent studies on the ms broadening of 47 tuc ( anderson et al .",
    "2009 ) and of ngc 6752 ( milone et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we started by dividing f275w and f336w images in two halves ( hereafter , samples 1 and 2 ) , and considered only those stars measured in both sub - samples . from each of the two independent sub sets , we plotted a cmd . as an example we show the cmd from the first data set in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "the selected bms and ms - a stars are represented with blue and green colors , while rms stars are plotted in red ( in all the plots , star colors are given according to their classification , as defined in fig .",
    "the dashed line is the rl of the rms , obtained as described in the previous section .",
    "then we subtracted from the observed color ( hereafter @xmath36 ) of each star the rl color at the same magnitude , obtaining the quantity @xmath37 .",
    "the straightened mss for the first and the second data set are plotted in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . in panel",
    "( d ) we show the color distribution of the straightened ms from the whole data set [ indicated as @xmath38 . in this case , the errors are smaller by a factor @xmath39 with respect to those of the two data halves .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the distribution of the difference between the colors in each half of the images [ i.e. , @xmath40 which is indicative of the color error .",
    "the histogram distribution of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are plotted in panels ( f ) and ( g ) , respectively . in table",
    "[ tabdata ] we give the estimated values of the intrinsic and error dispersion of the rms , for four equally - spaced magnitude intervals , assuming a gaussian distribution . as suggested by a visual inspection of panel ( d ) , there is no doubt that the rms is larger than what expected from the color - error distribution shown in panel ( e ) . even in the worst case of the last considered magnitude bin",
    ", we have an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath43 , which is significantly larger ( at the level of more than 10@xmath21 ) than the error dispersion ( @xmath44 ) .    figure  [ fig7 ] and the bottom two panels of col .",
    "( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] might suggest a possible split .",
    "we can not assess the significance of this feature , but we think it is worth of further investigation . as shown by v07 , the rms evolves into the brightest sgb - a sequence .",
    "the fact that the rms is broadened shall not come as a surprise . in piotto",
    "( 2005 ) , stars in this sequence were found to have a large spread in c , much larger than that of stars on the bms .",
    "if light - element abundances are correlated , as it happens in all the massive clusters , this implies also a spread in n and o. we do not know the magnitude of this spread , but it surely must be reflected in the photometry , especially in the blue - uv filters where ch and cn bands are located .",
    "the accurate cmds presented in previous sections impose a more detailed investigation also for the ms - a .    among all color combinations",
    ", the @xmath45 color is the one which provides us with the best separation between ms - a stars and the other mss of @xmath0  cen .",
    "the reason could be that the ms - a has a somehow peculiar cno content with respect to the other populations . as above outlined , filters centered in the blue - ultraviolet region , between @xmath13200 and @xmath14300  , are the most affected by cn and ch features ( see marino et al .",
    "2008 , their fig .",
    "moreover , the he content must affect the position of the different mss , as discussed in previous sections .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the @xmath17 vs.  @xmath45 cmd of @xmath0  cen . the ms - a fiducial sequence ( drawn by eye ) is plotted in red in panel ( b ) .",
    "we subtracted the color of this fiducial sequence from the color of all the stars at the same magnitude .",
    "the rectified mss are presented in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the magnitude interval 19.7@xmath46@xmath17@xmath4621.4 , where ms - a can be easily separated from the other mss .",
    "we drew a vertical line , located at @xmath47 to isolate ms - a members ( on the right ) from the rest of the mss [ on the left , hereafter called ( b+r)ms for simplicity ] .",
    "we defined three radial intervals in such a way that each radial bin contains the same amount of selected stars [ panels ( d ) ] .",
    "for each of the three radial intervals , using a logarithmic scale to emphasize ms - a counts , panel ( e ) plots the distribution of the rectified colors . the ratios of the star counts of ms - a/(b+r)ms are plotted in panel ( f ) as a function of the angular distance from the cluster center .",
    "errors are calculated as in bellini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) : for each radial interval , we derived the ms - a/(b+r)ms ratio in 5 magnitude bins [ as defined by the red horizontal lines in panel ( c ) ] , and we used the corresponding number of stars as weight to cumpute a weighted mean for the ms - a/(b+r)ms ratio in each of the 5 bins . finally , we derived an error for the entire radial interval from the residuals of the individual ratio values from their mean , using the same weights as we had used for the mean . the radial trend shown in panel ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] is consistent , within the errors , with the flat radial distribution of rgb - a stars ( the progeny of the msa stars ) with respect to ( rgb - mint+rgb - mp ) ones ( as found by bellini et al .",
    "2009 ) within the inner @xmath12 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "this region of the cmd was previously analyzed by sollima et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and by v07 .",
    "the latter studied the @xmath48 vs.  @xmath49 acs / wfc cmd .",
    "they identified four distinct stellar groups ( named , from bright to faint magnitudes , a , b , c and d , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) corresponding to at least four distinct stellar populations , plus a broad distribution of stars , between groups c and d.    wfc3 photometry reveals a new , much - more - complex picture of the sgb region . in the @xmath34 vs.  @xmath50 cmd of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] , stars of the original b and c components of v07 are widely spread in the f275w band , without any apparent substructure , while the brightest sgb component ( a ) is split into two branches figure [ fig12 ] shows a more quantitative analysis of the split of sgb - a .",
    "the dashed red line has been traced ( by hand ) between the two branches of sgb - a .",
    "for each star in the red box which includes the dashed line , we calculated the difference between the star magnitude and the magnitude of the dashed line at the same color of the star .",
    "the bimodal distribution of these magnitude differences shown by the histogram in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] confirms the presence of two distinct branches .",
    "it is not clear how the two sgb - a sequences evolve into the rgb , though in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] they seem to run parallel up to the bright part of the rgb .",
    "in particular , the origin of the bluest rgb is not obvious : is it coming from sgb - b or from the faintest sgb of sgb - a ?",
    "the bluest rgb could also be something similar to the broadened rgb of m4 visible in fig .",
    "11 of marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the broadening has been related to a spread in cno affecting the @xmath51-band .",
    "only chemical abundance measurements will allow us to answer this question .",
    "interestingly enough , the separation of the different rgb sequences becomes more visible in the cmd @xmath34 vs. @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "there is another feature of the sgb which is visible for the first time in the cmds presented in this paper .",
    "the sgb - d of v07 ( which corresponds to the sgb - a ferraro et al .",
    "2004 ) is also broadened , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] and , in more details , in fig .  [ fig13 ] .",
    "it is not clear whether this broadening corresponds to two distinct populations .",
    "a visual inspection of all these figures suggests that the faintest part of sgb - d could be associated to a poorly populated ms which runs on the red side of the ms - a .",
    "the sequence on the red side of the ms - a can not be a sequence of binaries , which would evolve into a brighter ( not fainter ) sgb .    in summary",
    ", the new wfc3 photometry shows that the sgb of @xmath0  cen is even more complex than thought so far .",
    "there are at least _ six _ distinct sequences , plus the broad distribution of stars between sgb - c and sgb - d already identified by v07 .",
    "typically , the horizontal branch ( hb ) amplifies all the complexities of a stellar population , and it can not be different for @xmath0  cen . indeed , the hb shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows a multiplicity of features and , in particular , a well - known , very - extended hb , with a pronounced blue hook ( dcruz et al .",
