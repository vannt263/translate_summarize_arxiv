    "in order to model the mg ii emission resonance doublet at @xmath62795,2803 ( hereafter mg ii ) , we fitted a power law to the continuum emission .",
    "in addition , the uv fe ii template of vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) was used for modeling and subtracting the fe ii contribution in all calibrated and de - reddened spectra .",
    "the mg ii emission line fluxes were obtained after fitting gaussian profiles . in figure 1 ( left side )",
    "we present a plot showing the variation of the @xmath7 vs. @xmath2 .",
    "when excluding the points near the 2005 and 2007 outbursts , a linear fit was obtained : @xmath8 , with a correlation coefficient @xmath9 . including our 2005 and 2007 data , a completely different tendency is observed . on september 3 , 2007 ( ut )",
    "the mg ii flux is found to be a factor @xmath10 smaller with respect to the above linear correlation .",
    "this tendency is even stronger on may 13 , 2005 ( ut ) , where the mg ii flux is a found to be a factor @xmath11 smaller .",
    "a similar behavior between @xmath7 vs. @xmath2 was found in ao 0235 + 16 ( raiteri et al .",
    "2007a ) .    using all spectra we also studied the variability behavior of the uv fe ii with respect to the continuum changes .",
    "we found a linear correlation ( see figure 1 , right side ) : @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "one of the main results of this study is that the fe ii flux tends to follow the continuum variations .",
    "although the origin of the uv fe ii lines in agn is not completely clarified ( joly et al .",
    "2008 ) , it seems possible that part of this emission originates from a region that is close to the base of the relativistic jet , while the mg ii may be emitted in a more extended region ( goad et al .",
    "1999 ) and can not respond immediately to dramatic flux variations .",
    "another possible scenario may be that the relativistic jet continuum swamps almost all the thermal contribution from the big blue bump ( see raiteri et al .",
    "2007b ) and also from the blr .",
    "finally , an anticorrelation between ew ( mg ii ) and @xmath2 was found using all spectra : ew(mg ii)@xmath14 , known as  intrinsic baldwin effect \" ( see osmer & shields 1999 ) .",
