    "when studying the statistical mechanics of random interfaces which typically arise between coexisting phases of a ( @xmath6-dimensional ) physical system in equilibrium , one often considers so - called _ effective _ models , which aim at describing the @xmath3-dimensional surface _ itself _ , free from its surroundings .",
    "arguably the most notorious example in this class is the massless harmonic crystal , or gaussian free field ( precise definitions will follow , see below ) .",
    "a natural approach in trying to gain some insight into the geometry of this field is to inquire about its level sets , say , above a given height @xmath7 . in case",
    "the underlying space is the cubic lattice @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , and due to the presence of strong correlations ( the susceptibility is infinite ) , this gives rise to an interesting percolation model , which was originally introduced by lebowitz and saleur in @xcite , and has since then been investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite for related results .",
    "only recently has it been shown in @xcite that the associated phase transition is non - trivial in _ all _ dimensions @xmath1 ( partial results were already obtained in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our main focus in the present work is to examine the limiting behavior of certain critical parameters associated to this transition in high dimension . of fundamental importance in this context",
    "is the heuristic principle by which this percolation model ought to fall in the `` domain of attraction '' of a corresponding model on the @xmath8-regular tree .",
    "our results indicate that this is indeed the case , and in fact , this paradigm permeates more or less explicitly many of the proofs below .",
    "ideally , we would also like to compare these results with corresponding ones in the tree - case _",
    "directly_. we hope to return to this point elsewhere .",
    "a first step in the direction of high - dimensional asymptotics is given by theorem 3.3 of @xcite , which asserts that the critical height @xmath4 for percolation of gaussian free field level sets , defined in below , is strictly positive when @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "in fact , a careful inspection of the proof of this theorem yields that @xmath9 as @xmath10 , which amounts to saying that the critical density for this percolation model converges to @xmath11 as @xmath3 tends to infinity . we will considerably refine this result by providing the leading asymptotic behavior of the critical density , as well as principal asymptotics for @xmath4 and a related critical parameter @xmath12 ( see below ) as @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "our proof follows in its broad lines the general strategy underlying similar results in bernoulli ( see @xcite and @xcite , section 4 ) and interlacement ( see @xcite and @xcite ) percolation .",
    "however , the implementation of this program highly depends on the specific nature of the model , as it crucially relies on a precise understanding of its dependence structure in high dimension . in particular , in the present context , the random walk representation of the gaussian free field , which will lead us to its `` perturbative '' expansion around a suitable _ independent _ field , will play a pivotal role in allowing for a precise understanding of the _ local _ connectivity of the level set ( we will explain this in greater detail below , see the discussion around ) .",
    "moreover , a severe technical obstruction is the absence of a bk - type inequality ( companion to the long - range dependence ) . in the independent case",
    ", this inequality underlies the successful deployment of such elaborate tools as the lace expansion , see @xcite and @xcite , chapter 9 . in our set - up , as a partial substitute , we develop suitable decoupling inequalities , much in the spirit of @xcite , @xcite , with the notable difference that they will need to work `` _ _ uniformly _ _ well '' for all sufficiently large @xmath3 .",
    "these inequalities will typically allow for a certain kind of ( static ) renormalization procedure , to which the dimension @xmath3 will be inextricably tied .",
    "we now describe our results and refer to section [ notation ] for details .",
    "we consider the lattice @xmath0 , @xmath1 , endowed with the usual nearest - neighbor graph structure , and investigate the gaussian free field on @xmath0 , with canonical law @xmath13 on @xmath14 ( equipped with the product @xmath15-algebra ) such that , @xmath16 = g ( x , y)$ } , \\text { for all } x , y \\in \\mathbb{z}^d , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the green function of simple random walk on @xmath0 , see .",
    "note that , for fixed @xmath3 , this model exhibits rather strong correlations , ( in particular , the susceptibility is infinite for all @xmath18 , cf .",
    "below ) . however , as @xmath3 grows , @xmath19 `` approaches '' an independent field , in a sense to be made precise below .    for any _ level _ @xmath7 , we introduce the random subset of @xmath0 @xmath20 often referred to as the _ excursion set _ ( or _ level set _ ) of the field @xmath19 above height @xmath21 . in order to study its percolative properties , we set @xmath22 $ ] , the probability that the origin lies in an infinite cluster ( i.e. connected component ) of @xmath23 . the function",
    "@xmath24 being decreasing , we define the critical parameter for level - set percolation as @xmath25 ( with the convention @xmath26 ) . following @xmath27 of @xcite , we also introduce a second critical point @xmath28 = 0 \\big\\},\\ ] ] where the event @xmath29 refers to the existence of a nearest - neighbor path in @xmath30 connecting @xmath31 , the ball of radius @xmath32 around @xmath11 in the @xmath33-norm , to @xmath34 , the @xmath33-sphere of radius @xmath35 around @xmath11 ( in fact does not exactly coincide with ( 0.6 ) in @xcite , which requires the relevant probability to decay at least polynomially in @xmath32 ; the two are in fact equivalent , and can be further weakened , see @xcite , theorem 2.1 ) . the definitions and",
    "immediately yield that @xmath36 for all @xmath1 .",
    "it is presently known that @xmath37 which implies that percolation of @xmath23 exhibits a non - trivial phase transition ( see @xcite , corollary 2 for the former and @xcite , theorem 2.6 for the latter result in ; see also theorem 3 in @xcite for a proof of @xmath38 ) .",
    "in particular , for all @xmath39 , @xmath23 only contains finite clusters , and a ( unique , see @xcite , remark 1.6 ) infinite cluster for all @xmath40 .",

    "moreover , as mentioned in the expository paragraph ( see @xcite , theorem 3.3 ) , @xmath46 our main goal in this paper is to prove the following asymptotic result concerning the critical density of this percolation model .",

    "below ) .    before describing our methods ,",
    "we make a few remarks concerning these results and the heuristics lurking behind them .",
    "as alluded to above , a recurrent theme in the proofs below will be that , in high dimensions , the free field at _ small _ scales ( at which the geometry felt by the random walk is roughly tree - like ) can be viewed as a _ perturbation _ of an independent gaussian field , and a considerable effort will go into understanding the precise effect of this perturbation on the connectivity of the level sets around the asymptotic value @xmath63 ( see the comments below , and the proofs of theorems [ t : local_cb ] and [ p : subst_comp ] ) .",
    "this perturbative behavior was already hinted at in the proof of in @xcite , which was based on a decomposition of the covariance @xmath64 for @xmath65 belonging to a ( lower - dimensional ) subspace @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , into the sum of a dominant _ diagonal _ part with entries close to @xmath68 ( thus inducing a field of independent gaussians ) and a `` small noise '' ( cf .",
    "lemma 3.1 . of @xcite for a precise statement ) . admitting this ( local ) resemblance of @xmath19 to an independent field",
    ", it is reasonable to compare to @xmath69 , the critical parameter for bernoulli site percolation on @xmath0 , which is known to be asymptotically equal to @xmath70 as @xmath71 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    regarding theorems [ t : asymptotics_ub ] and [ t : asymptotics_lb ] , using @xmath72 , and",
    "imply that @xmath73 ( we write @xmath74 as @xmath75 if @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is at present an important unresolved question whether both critical parameters are actually equal ( in any dimension ) .",
    "we now comment on the proofs .",
    "the proof of the upper bound follows a strategy inspired by that used in @xcite to prove finiteness of @xmath12 , for arbitrary , but _ fixed _",
    "dimension @xmath3 ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for similar ideas in the context of random interlacements ) . in particular , we use a variant of the renormalization scheme developed therein .",
    "however , the present task requires a scheme which works `` uniformly in @xmath3 '' as @xmath3 becomes large . using careful estimates on the behavior of the green function of simple random walk on a high - dimensional lattice developed in @xcite , we obtain a `` decoupling inequality , '' which enables us to propagate bounds on the relevant crossing events in @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "the definition of @xmath41 ) , where @xmath78 for some @xmath79 , at small scale ( the so - called seed estimates ) to controls of such crossing probabilities at arbitrarily large scale in @xmath80 ( this is in fact much more than we need ) . a significant part of the problem is to produce sufficiently sharp seed estimates , in order to initiate the renormalization , see remark [ r : renorm ] , 2 ) below ( note that , in contrast to the proof of the finiteness of @xmath12 in @xcite , which allowed one to look for a corresponding regime at arbitrary large @xmath21 , we are now constrained to remain in the vicinity of @xmath63 ) .    obtaining the desired bounds at small scales",
    "involves controlling the probability to see a crossing in @xmath77 from a given point @xmath81 to the boundary of the @xmath82-ball centered at @xmath81 of radius @xmath83 , see and theorem [ t : local_cb ] below ( we emphasize that the use of the @xmath82-norm is essential here , as this distance controls the short - range behavior of @xmath84 in high dimensions , where the tree - like nature of the lattice manifests itself , cf . ) .",
    "this is the first instance where the aforementioned ( local ) perturbative expansion comes into play . in rough terms , the domain markov property for the free field @xmath19 allows us to `` discover '' it along any given path ( in the present case , one joining @xmath81 to @xmath85 ) `` dynamically , '' starting from a suitable _ independent _ gaussian field @xmath86 , and introducing the required dependence at each step .",
    "specifically , if @xmath87 , @xmath88 , denotes the trace of the path in question , we represent @xmath89 where the error term is a suitable linear combination of @xmath90 , cf .",
    "lemma [ l : conds_exps2 ] below for a precise statement .",
    "this procedure enables us to `` pass '' from @xmath19 to the independent field @xmath86 , provided we carefully keep track of the error we make in each step .    for the lower bound , theorem [ t : asymptotics_lb ] ,",
    "our method mimics in its broad lines the approach of @xcite and @xcite , section 4 , to the corresponding problem in bernoulli ( bond and site ) percolation on @xmath0 , involving ideas of @xcite from hypercube percolation ( see also @xcite for a completely different solution , and @xcite for a corresponding result in interlacement percolation , following a similar spirit ) .",
    "the proof essentially comprises two parts , which we briefly detail .    in the first part , we show the following finite - size criterion .",
    "suppose we partition the set @xmath91 into translates of the hypercube .",
    "roughly speaking , we show in theorem [ t : local_global ] below that if @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , @xmath53 ,    * contains a `` giant '' connected component in each of the sets @xmath94 and its four neighboring translates , and * all these components are connected in @xmath92 within the union of @xmath94 and its four neighboring translates ,    with sufficiently high probability , then @xmath95 percolates ( the `` additive '' sprinkling in @xmath21 is more than enough for the sake of proving ) . due to the long - range dependence , this reduction step does not follow from standard stochastic domination arguments ( see for example @xcite ) , and theorem [ t : local_global ] is established by means of a ( two - dimensional ) renormalization argument .    in the second ( and more difficult ) part of the proof of theorem [ t : asymptotics_lb",
    "] , we show that this criterion actually holds . in the independent",
    "setting of @xcite and @xcite , the validity of such a criterion is essentially guaranteed by the analysis in @xcite of ( independent ) percolation in the hypercube .",
    "our procedure essentially comprises two steps .",
    "first , drawing inspiration from @xcite , cf .",
    "in particular lemma 1 therein , we grow _ substantial _ connected components in @xmath96 ( with @xmath93 ) , which have cardinality growing polynomially in @xmath3 . to achieve this ,",
    "we embed into @xmath94 a deterministic @xmath97-regular tree @xmath98 , rooted at @xmath11 , with @xmath99 comparable to @xmath3 for every @xmath53 , of depth depending on @xmath100 only . here again , the `` perturbative representation '' of crucially enters in allowing us to compare @xmath101 to a certain ( supercritical ) galton - watson process on the same tree in order to derive a meaningful lower bound for the probability to see a substantial component at the origin .",
    "the precise statement is the object of theorem [ p : subst_comp ] , and an easy consequence is that most vertices in @xmath94 are in fact either neighboring or contained in such a substantial component , see corollary [ c : number_subst_comps ] .",
    "the second step then consists of gluing all substantial components within the hypercube to a giant one ( i.e. a connected component whose closure in @xmath94 contains at least @xmath102 points ) , and subsequently connecting neighboring giant components , which is achieved in theorem [ t : giant_comp ] by two successive sprinkling operations . quantifying that it is highly unlikely for the substantial components not to merge after sprinkling requires isoperimetric considerations in @xmath94 ( as were used in the proofs of @xcite , theorem 1 and @xcite , theorem 4.2 ) .",
    "however , the ( wealth of ) edges which are hereby deduced to be pivotal for a giant component to emerge or not , are not necessarily `` well spread - out '' within @xmath94 and might therefore influence each other rather strongly .",
    "a slightly careful bookkeeping of this mutual influence is required in order to show that it is too costly for many pivotal sites to remain `` closed '' ( cf .",
    "the proof of lemma [ l : giant_event_h ] ) .",
    "this then completes the proof of the lower bound .",
    "let us now describe the organization of this article . in section [ notation ]",
    ", we introduce some notation and review a few known results concerning simple random walk on a high - dimensional lattice and the gaussian free field .",
    "section [ s : upper_bound ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ t : asymptotics_ub ] .",
    "subsection [ s : ub_rs ] introduces the renormalization scheme .",
    "its main result is proposition [ p : dec_ineq ] , which entails the induction step ( one - step renormalization ) .",
    "subsection [ s : ub_lcb ] contains the local estimates on the connectivity of @xmath103 , @xmath53 .",
    "the main result , theorem [ t : local_cb ] , is of independent interest , but it is needed crucially to establish the required seed estimate which enables us to trigger the renormalization scheme . finally , in subsection [ s : denouement ] , we put these two ingredients together to complete the proof of .",
    "the proof of the lower bound is the object of section [ s : lower_bound ] .",
    "first , we show the abovementioned finite - size criterion , which requires another ( simpler ) renormalization scheme .",
    "the main result is theorem [ t : local_global ] , which can be found in subsection [ s : finite_size_criterion ] .",
    "having established this reduction step , we prove that most points in the hypercube are either contained or neighboring a substantial component in the level set of interest .",
    "this is done in subsection [ s : subst_comp ] , see in particular theorem [ p : subst_comp ] and corollary [ c : number_subst_comps ] therein .",
    "finally , theorem [ t : giant_comp ] in subsection [ s : connecting_subst_comps ] connects these substantial components , thereby completing the proof of the criterion .",
    "the lower bound then follows readily by collecting the pieces , and subsection [ s : connecting_subst_comps ] also contains the proof of theorem [ t : asymptotics_density ] , which follows straightforwardly from and .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a remark concerning our convention regarding constants : we denote by @xmath104 positive constants with values changing from place to place .",
    "numbered constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 are defined at the place they first occur within the text and remain fixed from then on until the end of the article .",
    "all constants are numerical , and their dependence on any additional parameter , including , most importantly , the dimension @xmath3 , will always appear in the notation .",
    "the only exceptions to this rule are the last two sections [ s : subst_comp ] and [ s : connecting_subst_comps ] , in which constants may implicitly depend on a parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the reader will be reminded of this exception in due time .",
    "in this section , we introduce some notation to be used in the sequel , collect some important estimates related to simple random walk on a high - dimensional lattice , and review a few useful facts concerning the gaussian free field .",
