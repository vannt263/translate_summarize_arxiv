    "<S> we introduce a hamiltonian dynamics for the description of long - range interacting systems in contact with a thermal bath ( i.e. , in the canonical ensemble ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics confirms statistical mechanics equilibrium predictions for the hamiltonian mean field model and the equilibrium ensemble equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> we find that long - lasting quasi - stationary states persist in presence of the interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that quasi - stationary states are indeed reproducible in real physical experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions is important for a variety of physical applications , including , e.g. , gravitational systems , plasmas , bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in such systems , </S>",
    "<S> the inter - particle interactions decay at large distances @xmath0 as @xmath1 with @xmath2 ( spatial dimension ) and ordinary statistical mechanics assumptions are questioned by nontrivial effects , like persistence of correlations and non - negligible interface energies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the boltzmann transport equation picture for the approach to equilibrium is not valid @xcite and long - range interacting systems may even display inequivalences among different equilibrium statistical ensembles @xcite . because of these subtleties a privileged investigation tool is the microscopic hamiltonian dynamical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian dynamics at fixed - energy ( microcanonical ensemble ) for a paradigmatic long - range hamiltonian ( see below ) directly connected with experiments @xcite revealed the existence of long - lived quasi - stationary states ( qss ) that finally cross over to boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question arises about the reproducibility of such qsss in real physical experiments , where the environment introduces perturbations that can not be taken into account in the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> if so , practical advantages could be obtained by knowing control mechanisms that improve or hinder this quasi - stationarity . </S>",
    "<S> the use of classical numerical prescriptions ( like the nos - hoover or the monte carlo @xcite ) , to perform such an investigation raises some subtle questions , since these methods implicitly assume the bg equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose a novel , physically transparent , microscopic hamiltonian dynamics obtained by coupling the long - range system with a thermal bath ( tb ) which simulates the effect of the environment on the system itself . for sufficiently large time - scales , such dynamics confirms the equilibrium canonical ensemble predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , starting with out - of - equilibrium initial conditions , we discover that long - lived qsss subsist in presence of the tb , providing evidence in favor of the reproducibility of qsss in real physical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the relaxation process following the qss and the peculiar behavior of the boltzmann @xmath3-function .    in a magnetic context , the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite describes a set of @xmath4 globally coupled @xmath5-spins with hamiltonian @xmath6 , \\label{hmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are the spin angles and @xmath8 their angular momenta ( velocities ) . </S>",

    "<S> phase functions such as the specific kinetic and potential energies fluctuate around stationary or quasi - stationary non - equilibrium average values . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a microscopic setup where the hmf model is in contact with a short - range thermal bath ( tb ) in such a way that the thermodynamic limit is achieved with a negligible interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium dynamics confirms the microcanonical / canonical equivalence for the hmf model . </S>",
    "<S> if the hmf - tb coupling is weak enough , the relaxation to equilibrium is still characterized by drastic slowing - downs ( qsss ) where also the system energy fluctuate around quasi - stationary average values . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in a separate paper @xcite the details about the statistical mechanics of qsss in the canonical ensemble , a question of considerable debate @xcite . here </S>",

    "<S> the total hamiltonian @xmath22 defines then a microcanonical system ( constant energy @xmath23 ) , in which the energy of the hmf model can fluctuate . in our approach , the temperature is defined by ( twice ) the specific kinetic energy and we expect the tb to maintain a constant temperature about which the hmf model thermally equilibrates . by assuming a `` surface - like effect '' @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) , we make sure that the interaction energy , @xmath26 , satisfy @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , thus ensuring a well defined thermodynamic limit . for the present results we chose @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to integrate the equation of motion we use a velocity verlet @xcite algorithm with an integration step guaranteeing conservation of total energy within an uncertainty of @xmath31 .     and @xmath32 temperatures for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",

    "<S> a crucial issue is to see whether they survive when the coupling between the hmf and the tb is switched on @xcite . to address this point </S>",

    "<S> the tb - temperature is first fixed at @xmath80 . the time dependence of @xmath81 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_qss_1]b , c ) suggests that the qsss indeed exist even in the canonical setup and independently of @xmath61 ( if @xmath61 is small enough ) . denoting by @xmath65 the life time of the qsss we found that @xmath82 , with @xmath83 that tends to zero as @xmath61 increases and to the microcanonical estimate given in @xcite as @xmath84 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_qss_1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary evidences @xcite , suggest that @xmath65 is also influenced by the `` surface effect '' parameter @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that during the qss the long - range system does not thermalize with the tb . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a consistent change ( @xmath68 ) of @xmath46 does not alter @xmath60 and even the subset of tb - spins in direct contact with the hmf model remains at @xmath46 @xcite . however , energy fluctuations are significantly larger than those due to the algorithm precision ( @xmath86 for @xmath33 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this distinguishes the canonical qsss from the microcanonical ones . during these qsss , </S>",
    "<S> the hmf model are in a partial equilibrium state at a temperature ( specific kinetic energy ) which is not the one of the tb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps this is one reason why a nos - hoover dynamics with the same out - from - equilibrium initial conditions is not capable to reproduce the relaxation to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we verified @xcite that in such a case a nos - hoover dynamics displays very strong fluctuations of the dynamical variables ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) that do not decay with time . </S>",
    "<S> another important remark is that classical assumptions in mesoscopic stochastic equations seem to rule out the existence of such canonical qss . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a stability analysis applied to a fokker - planck description of the hmf model in both ensembles ( canonical and microcanonical ) shows that anomalous velocity pdfs are ( neutrally ) stable only in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> title=\"fig : \" ]    the occurrence of canonical qsss points towards an extension of the ensemble equivalence to some aspects of the non equilibrium properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find on the other hand that there is a substantial microcanonical / canonical _ inequivalence _ in the relaxation to equilibrium process that follows the qss . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the final equilibrium specific magnetization changes by a factor @xmath89 going from the microcanonical ( fig . [ fig_qss_1]a ) to the canonical ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_qss_1]b , c ) simulations , independently of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> a further indication of this inequivalence is given by the time evolution of the @xmath3-function , , in the two ensembles . indeed , if during the microcanonical dynamics @xmath90 on the average increases , reaching its maximum at equilibrium , in the @xmath91 canonical ones it displays a maximum during the qss and then _ decreases _ towards the @xmath80 equilibrium value ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_eta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these unconventional behaviors with respect to the @xmath3-theorem are consequences of the different relaxation dynamics in the two ensembles , i.e. fixed - energy and fixed - temperature ( full circles in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig_eq]c ) .    in summary , we introduced a hamiltonian canonical setup for long - range interacting systems through a coupling with a short - range interacting tb . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is described by a parameter that can be tuned continuously to provide a unified description of microcanonical and canonical ensembles . by applying our scheme to the hmf model we verified its capability to reproduce the equilibrium bg statistics in both ensemble ( ensemble equilibrium equivalence ) . </S>",
    "<S> the major feature of this setup is that it is based solely on microscopic hamiltonian dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is a novelty with respect to previous approaches , that allows an unbiased dynamical description of the non equilibrium properties of such system . as a result we found that , if the coupling with the tb is weak enough and we start from out - of - equilibrium initial conditions , the dynamics reveals the existence of quasi stationary states in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> these qsss are reminiscent of the microcanonical ones @xcite in the sense that , for example , their lifetime diverges with the system size @xmath4 in a power law fashion . on the other hand in presence of the tb </S>",
    "<S> , the life - time of the qsss is influenced by the parameters controlling the interaction between long - range system and tb . </S>",
    "<S> this could be useful for an experimentalist who is willing to enhance or hinder the quasi - stationary behavior @xcite and could also be of some importance in the understanding of the dynamical evolution of quasi - stationary structures , e.g. , in galaxies @xcite , or in other long - range interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of canonical qss extends the notion of ensemble equivalence from equilibrium to some non equilibrium properties . </S>",
    "<S> a substantial microcanonical / canonical _ inequivalence _ is found in the relaxation to equilibrium process following the qss and it is clearly revealed by a dramatic change in the time dependence of the boltzmann @xmath3-function . </S>",
    "<S> of course , a more detailed statistical description ( and interpretation ) of the canonical qss is needed and we are confident that our unbiased set up will be a useful tool for this achievement@xcite not only with respect to the hmf model , but also to other hamiltonian long - range systems exhibiting either dynamical peculiar features @xcite or equilibrium ensemble inequivalence @xcite . </S>"
