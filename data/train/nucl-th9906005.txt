    "@xcite at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) is currently measuring spin - dependent effects in the thermal neutron capture process n+pd+ , [ polnp ] wherein , as indicated , both the incident neutron and the target proton are polarized . at threshold ,",
    "the initial nuclear state is in either the @xmath9 or @xmath10 channel , where @xmath11 is the isospin .",
    "the process ( [ polnp ] ) therefore receives contributions from the isovector m1 matrix element ( m1v ) between the initial @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the final deuteron ( @xmath14 ) state , along with the isoscalar m1 matrix element ( ) and the isoscalar e2 ( ) matrix element between the initial @xmath15 ( @xmath14 ) and the final deuteron @xmath16 states .",
    "contribution recently considered by chen , rupak and savage @xcite . ] since m1v is by far the largest amplitude ( see below ) , the spin - averaged cross section @xmath17 is totally dominated by m1v .",
    "meanwhile , since the initial @xmath12 state has @xmath18 , the m1v can not yield spin - dependent effects , whereas and can .",
    "this means that , as first noted by breit and rustgi@xcite , the spin - dependent observables in ( [ polnp ] ) are sensitive to small isoscalar matrix elements . to explain the significance of this feature in the context of nuclear effective field theory ( eft )",
    ", we first give a brief discussion of the  chiral filter hypothesis\"@xcite .    the chiral filter hypothesis based on current algebra",
    "was proposed in 1978 prior to the advent of modern nuclear eft .",
    "it dictates that corrections to the single - particle transitions in nuclei for the isovector m1 operator and the weak axial charge operator should be dominated by one - soft - pion - exchange two - body currents .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this dominance is naturally explained by chiral perturbation theory ; the soft - pion exchange diagrams are leading - order two - body diagrams in chiral counting . a thorough nuclear eft calculation of m1v carried out in @xcite gave a precise , parameter - free estimate of @xmath19 , which was in perfect agreement with the experimental value @xcite ; furthermore , it was confirmed that the major corrections to the one - body ( single - nucleon ) current in m1v indeed come from one - soft - pion - exchange . for the axial charge also ,",
    "its large enhancement due to the soft - pion exchange two - body currents is by now well established @xcite .",
    "thus , for the observables  protected \" by the chiral filter ( i.e. , observables essentially determined by leading chiral - order terms ) , nuclear eft has been highly successful .",
    "the question now is whether we can profitably apply nuclear eft to observables  unprotected \" by the chiral filter . with leading chiral - order contributions vanishing , one must consider higher order diagrams , a task which can quickly become formidable .",
    "the above - mentioned isoscalar matrix elements , m1s and e2s , are examples of the  unprotected \" observable .",
    "as is well known , the one - body contribution of is highly suppressed due to the orthogonality between the initial @xmath15 and the final deuteron state .",
    "the soft - pion exchange is also suppressed , there being no isoscalar @xmath20 vertex in the leading order chiral lagrangian , where @xmath21 is the external isoscalar field that couples to the baryonic current . due to this double suppression ,",
    "the size of @xmath22 becomes even comparable ( see below ) to that of , which is a higher - order multipole and hence , in normal circumstances , can be ignored .",
    "this situation suggests that we must go up to an unusually high chiral order before getting sensible estimates of the isoscalar matrix elements that govern the spin observables in ( [ polnp ] ) .",
    "however , we show in this paper ( confirming the previous results reported in @xcite ) that nuclear eft allows us to make a systematic and reasonably reliable estimation of m1s and e2s .    by the very nature of eft ,",
    "an effective lagrangian involves , at each order of power counting , a certain number of parameters .",
    "these parameters are in principle calculable from first principles for a given scale ( _ e.g. _ , lattice qcd  @xcite ) but , in practice , they have to be fixed by experimental data .",
    "once the parameters are so fixed , the lagrangian can then be used to make predictions for other processes governed by the same parameters .",
    "however , it often happens that after fixing the parameters there is not much room left for prediction .",
    "a major point of our work is to demonstrate that one can make a genuine eft prediction even for the highly suppressed m1s and e2s .",
    "our _ bona fide _ prediction not biased by pre - existing numbers can be tested soon by the forthcoming results from the ill experiment @xcite .",
    "adopting the convention of mller et al  @xcite , we write the transition amplitude as _",
    "d , ( , ) | t| _ np = ^_d m ( , ) _ np with ( , ) = [ amp ] where @xmath23 is the velocity of the projectile neutron , @xmath24 is the deuteron normalization factor @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denotes the spin wave function of the final deuteron ( initial @xmath0 ) state .",
    "the emitted photon is characterized by the unit momentum vector @xmath28 , the energy @xmath29 and the helicity @xmath30 , and its polarization vector is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitudes , @xmath32 , @xmath22 and @xmath33 , represent the isovector m1 , isoscalar m1 and isoscalar e2 contributions , respectively .",
    "these quantities are defined in such a manner that they all have the dimension of length , and the cross section for the unpolarized @xmath0 system takes the form _",
    "unpol= ^2 + ^2 + ^2 .",
    "[ xsection ] as we shall see below , the isoscalar terms ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are strongly suppressed relative to @xmath36  approximately by a factor of @xmath37  so the unpolarized cross section is practically unaffected by the isoscalar terms . as mentioned , the isovector m1 amplitude was calculated  @xcite very accurately up to @xmath38 relative to the single - particle operator .",
    "the result expressed in terms of @xmath32 is : @xmath39 fm , which should be compared to the empirical value @xmath40 fm . in this paper , therefore , we will focus on the isoscalar amplitudes .",

    "this feature suggests the possibility of obtaining two independent constraints on @xmath63 s , one from @xmath58 and the other from @xmath61 , which would allow extraction of the individual values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "our argument above is based on the strict threshold kinematics .",
    "a few remarks are in order here .",
    "when the velocity of the projectile neutron @xmath23 goes to zero , the cross section diverges as @xmath68 and consequently the matrix elements as @xmath69 .",
    "however , the quantity that is actually measured in experiment is the yield , the flux times the cross section . since the flux is proportional to @xmath23 , @xmath70 near threshold is constant with good accuracy , and one measures the thermal average of this @xmath23-independent yield .",
    "it is customary to translate the measured yield into the cross sections using a fixed velocity , @xmath71 m / s , which corresponds to the average neutron velocity at room temperature .",
    "we adopt this convention throughout this paper , and we mean by  at threshold \" that we are neglecting any higher order corrections in @xmath23 .",
    "chen et al.@xcite pointed out that at this velocity the isovector e1 matrix element ( we denote it by e1v ) connecting initial @xmath72 waves with the deuteron state can compete with m1s and e2s .",
    "they calculated @xmath58 including the e1v contribution but the corresponding result for @xmath61 has not been reported .",
    "the inclusion of e1v affects the asymmetry @xmath73 defined and calculated in @xcite .",

    "this means that @xmath58 , eq.([pgammadef ] ) , is not influenced at all by the e1v contribution .",
    "meanwhile , according to @xcite , @xmath61 arising from e1v has a very different @xmath75 dependence from that arising from m1s and e2s . in principle , therefore , it should be possible to distinguish experimentally these two @xmath61 s of different origins . in the present work limited to the threshold kinematics , we do not discuss the contribution of e1v .",

    "the chiral counting rules relevant to electroweak vertices in two - nucleon systems are well known by now ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the chiral index @xmath76 of a given irreducible diagram is given by = 1 - 2 c + 2 l + _ i _ i ,   _ i = d_i + e_i + -2 , [ naive]where @xmath77 is the number of disjoint pieces ( @xmath78 for one - body currents and @xmath79 for two - body currents ) , and @xmath80 the number of loops ; @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the numbers of derivatives/@xmath84 s , external fields and nucleon lines at the @xmath85-th vertex . since chiral symmetry guarantees @xmath86 , eq.([naive ] ) implies that the one - body em current @xmath87 starts at @xmath88 while the two - body current @xmath89 starts at @xmath90 . as spelled out in @xcite",
    ", there are additional suppression factors of either a kinematical or symmetry origin .",
    "for instance , the space - part of the one - body current is suppressed by one power in @xmath91 relative to its time part .",
    "the detailed counting rules for the two - body isoscalar em current are rather complicated and will be discussed later .    at present , there are essentially two  alternative \" ways of power counting in setting up an effective field theory for two - nucleon systems .",
    "one is the original weinberg scheme  @xcite , in which the leading four - fermi contact interaction and a pion - exchange are treated on the same footing in calculating the  irreducible \" graphs for a potential that is to be iterated to all orders in the ",
    "reducible \" channel . the power counting is done only for irreducible vertices .",
    "the other is the  power divergence subtraction \" ( pds ) scheme  @xcite , in which only the leading ( nonderivative ) four - fermi contact interaction is iterated to all orders , with the higher - order contact interactions and the pion exchange treated perturbatively . while the pds scheme is perhaps more systematic in power counting , we believe that the weinberg scheme is not only consistent with the strategy of eft but also , in the sense developed below , more flexible and predictive with possible errors due to potential inconsistency in power counting generically suppressed . in our work",
    "we adopt the weinberg scheme . in this framework ,",
    "the power counting for electroweak transition amplitudes simply reduces to chiral counting in the irreducible vertex for the current , as the current appears only once in the graphs .",
    "we are then allowed to separate the current matrix element into the one - body ( single - particle ) and two - body ( exchange - current ) terms .",
    "this framework has the advantage that it can be straightforwardly applied to n - body systems for @xmath92 .",
    "iterating the irreducible vertex to all orders in the reducible channel is equivalent to solving the schrdinger equation with a corresponding potential .",
    "this then suggests that we use , in calculating nuclear responses to slowly varying electroweak probes , those wave functions computed with so - called phenomenological  realistic potentials \" .",
    "a prime example of these realistic potentials is the argonne @xmath93 potential  @xcite ( called in short av18 ) .",
    "thus in this approach , referred to as the _ hybrid approach _ , the one - body and two - body transition operators derived from eft are sandwiched between the initial and final two - nucleon wavefunctions distorted by a phenomenological n - n potential .",
    "this procedure of mapping effective field theory to realistic wave functions has recently been justified by means of a cutoff regularization  @xcite .",
    "a similar argument in support of such a hybrid procedure has been presented by van kolck  @xcite .",
    "previously we adopted this scheme to study the unpolarized @xmath94 reaction for the thermal neutron .",
    "the cross section for this process was computed to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the above - described chiral counting scheme for the transition vertex  @xcite , and with the use of the av18 wave functions .",
    "the resulting theoretical cross section , @xmath95 , agrees very well with the experimental value @xmath96 fm @xcite ; @xmath97 consists of the leading 1-body contribution , @xmath98 , and the 2-body exchange - current contribution , which in conformity with the chiral filter is dominated by the soft one - pion exchange .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the single - particle matrix element has negligible uncertainty , and therefore the theoretical error is entirely attributable to the uncertainty in the exchange - current operator associated with the short - distance part of the interactions .",
    "this short - range behavior is not fully controlled in the formulation of @xcite .",
    "the short - distance part introduces a scale and renormalization - scheme dependence , and only those results that are not sensitive to this uncertainty can be trusted . in a framework that uses realistic wave functions ,",
    "the short - distance scale is set by a ( momentum ) cutoff proportional to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the  hard - core radius \" that removes the part of the wave function for @xmath101 .",
    "the net effect of this cutoff is that in addition to cutting the radial integrals in the coordinate space , it removes _ all _ zero - range terms in the current operator including zero - ranged counter terms .",
    "after the four - fermion counter term is removed by the hard core , there are no more parameters in the theory  .",
    "this procedure , familiar to nuclear physicists , may be viewed as a form of exploiting the scheme dependence .",
    "we shall refer to this procedure as the hard - core cutoff scheme ( hccs ) .",
    "hccs can be justified for the process in question by using a ( momentum ) cutoff @xmath102 and showing that the counter - term contribution  killed \" by the hard core lies within that uncertainty range .",
    "is related to the hard - core radius used in standard nuclear physics calculations . ]",
    "the @xmath103 theoretical error assigned to @xmath97 above represents uncertainty in this cutoff procedure .",
    "we will see below that , when the chiral filter does not apply , the removal of the zero - range counter terms by the simple hard - core cutoff may be much less reliable .      either starting from the well - known em form factors of the nucleon , or carrying out an explicit chpt calculation that reproduces the form factors , we arrive at the following expressions for the one - body operators : _",

    "we see that the size of the one - body @xmath22 is about @xmath106 times smaller than m1v , a suppression which can be traced to the above - mentioned orthogonality and the smallness of @xmath107 as compared to @xmath108 .",

    "however , these radial functions can be approximated as @xmath166 and @xmath167 . the small-@xmath160 contribution ( @xmath168 ) of the first integral of eq.([naivemut ] ) then can be written as _ 0^r_c",
    "dr f_t u_d(0 ) u_t(0 ) a where @xmath169 is an @xmath100-dependent but wavefunction - independent constant .",
    "this contribution can be absorbed into the redefintion of the parameter @xmath151 ; the resulting @xmath151 will become @xmath100-dependent . the net effect of this procedure",
    "is to remove the @xmath157 contribution while retaining the @xmath100-dependent @xmath151 term .",
    "operationally , we can achieve the same goal by replacing the delta function attached to @xmath151 with the delta - shell function , ^3 ( ) .",
    "[ deltashell]for a given value of @xmath100 we can fix @xmath151 by fitting the deuteron magnetic moment .",
    "we shall call this scheme the modified hard - core cutoff scheme ( mhccs ) . a regularization scheme similar to mhccs",
    "has often been used in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter we drop the prime on @xmath151 for simplicity .    in mhccs ,",

    "our results can be summarized as = ( -2.850.01)10 ^ -3  , where the error bar stands for the @xmath100-dependence .",
    "it is highly noteworthy that the @xmath100-independence holds even when @xmath120 changes by a factor of @xmath181 .",
    "we also observe that the individual contributions coming from and are of the same order as the lo one - body contribution .",
    "this feature can be traced to the afore - mentioned facts that the lo one - body contribution is suppressed by the orthogonality of the wavefunctions , and that the is suppressed due to the smallness of @xmath182 .",
    "about half of the contributions are cancelled by the contributions . in obtaining the above numerical results",
    ", we used the ksrf value , @xmath183 , for the @xmath184 coupling constant featuring in the wess - zumino term .",
    "if instead we use a more conventional value , @xmath185 , then the resonance - exchange contribution decreases , leading to a larger cancellation between the loop contribution and the contributions .",
    "even with the use of a unrealistically small value of the @xmath182 which would cause a complete cancellation among the 2-body terms , we have found @xmath186 ( for the entire range of @xmath172 ) , which differs only about 2  % from @xmath22 in table 1 .",
    "we note that the mec contribution reduces the one - body contribution by about 30  % .",
    "the two - body contribution to the @xmath33 turns out to be quite small , @xmath187 for the whole range of @xmath188 . combining the one - body and two - body contributions , we obtain = ( 1.40 0.01 ) 10 ^ -3  .",
    "correspondingly , the two - body contribution to the deuteron quadrupole moment also is quite small , @xmath189 .",
    "this means that the discrepancy between the experimental value ( @xmath190 ) and the one - body contribution ( @xmath191 ) can not be explained in terms of the two - body effects as calculated here .",
    "we now discuss briefly the possibility of another renormalization scheme .",
    "earlier , we invoked eq.([v1term ] ) to eliminate the contribution of the @xmath143 term .",
    "however , if we use a non - zero value of @xmath100 , the delta - function gets smeared and therefore the @xmath143 term can have a finite contribution even though suppressed by powers of @xmath192 .",
    "one then might wonder if there exists a possibility to renormalize the deuteron quadrupole moment @xmath193 as well as the magnetic moment by adjusting @xmath143 .",
    "this is indeed possible , and we shall refer to this scheme as mhccs@xmath194 . since the extension of mhccs to mhccs@xmath194 is straightforward , we simply quote the results . for the range of @xmath195",
    ", we find @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "thus mhccs@xmath194 and mhccs give very similar results .",
    "we have found that , as far as the observables are concerned , the mhccs@xmath194 results exhibit even a higher degree of insensitivity to @xmath100 than those of mhccs .",
    "meanwhile , the values of @xmath143 and @xmath120 in mhccs@xmath194 vary as @xmath198 and @xmath199 , when @xmath100 changes from 0.01 fm to 0.8 fm . while neither @xmath143 nor @xmath120 is an observable , the occurrence of these large coefficients , [ nwz ] ) , we can infer that the _ natural scales _ of the @xmath143 and @xmath120 are @xmath200 and @xmath201 , respectively .",
    "] as well as the huge variation of @xmath143 with respect to @xmath100 is rather offending to the _ naturalness _ of the theory .",
    "so we will not consider this scheme seriously .    to illustrate the convergence of our chiral expansion",
    ", we also present the results that are renormalized only up to . to this order",
    ", there are no loops , and @xmath33 does not receive any two - particle contribution .",
    "the results for @xmath22 again turn out to be very close to what we obtained in mhccs , exhibiting little @xmath100-dependence : for @xmath172 , = ( -2.84 0.01)10 ^ -3  .",
    "the only  isospin - violating \" effect that features in the above consideration is the trivial fact that the two - nucleon system can emit both isovector and isoscalar photons .",
    "we examine here whether any significant additional isospin - violating effects can arise due to higher - order electromagnetic ( em ) interactions , or isospin impurity in the two - nucleon system .",
    "although in normal circumstances these effects give only minor corrections , they might be important in calculating highly suppressed amplitudes such as m1s and e2s .",
    "it is particularly important to assess those isospin - violating effects in the dominant m1v which mock the isoscalar amplitude .",
    "first , we argue that isospin violation in the initial- and final - state interactions can not influence the observables of our concern . to produce any spin - dependent effects",
    ", the initial @xmath0 state must have @xmath202 , and hence , at threshold , should be a @xmath15 state .",
    "if this state could be mixed with @xmath12 ( the only other available state at threshold ) , then the dominant m1v transition connecting @xmath12 and the deuteron would produce a rather significant correction to the genuine m1s . in the two - nucleon systems , however , the conservation of @xmath203 dictates that , even in the presence of isospin - violating interactions , there be no mixing between the @xmath12 and @xmath15 channels .",
    "next , we need to examine radiative corrections to the m1 operator itself .",
    "instead of considering all possible diagrams , we study here a typical diagram just to get a rough estimate .",
    "one of the diagrams that give non - vanishing corrections is obtained from fig .",
    "3@xmath204 by replacing the one - pion line in it with a photon line .",
    "let @xmath205 be the ratio of the contribution of this radiative correction diagram to that of fig .",
    "the em correction becomes more ( less ) important for lower ( higher ) momentum transfers .",
    "when the momentum transfer is of order of @xmath84 , we find @xmath206 , where @xmath207 ( @xmath208 mev )",
    ". applied to a specific case of @xmath22 , however , this ratio is enhanced by @xmath209 , as the isovector @xmath210 vertex can contribute to the isoscalar current due to the isospin breaking em interaction , and as a result the ratio of the em correction becomes @xmath211 .",
    "thus the em correction might be substantial compared to the .",
    "we remark , however , that , in mhccs ( and also in mhccs@xmath194 ) , this amount of correction would cause negligible changes in the final results .    to conclude , we recapitulate our predictions in the mhccs scheme for the ratios of the relevant matrix elements and the polarization observables : & = & ( -0.490.01 ) 10 ^ -3 , + & = & ( 0.240.01 ) 10 ^ -3,[ourpred ] [ rme]and strictly at threshold p_&= & ( -1.04 0.01)10 ^ -3,[ppred ] + _ & = & 0.800.02 , [ etais]where the errors represent the variance among mhccs , mhccs@xmath194 and the mhccs",
    ". the @xmath100-dependences are negligible .",
    "the above values of @xmath58 and @xmath61 are for complete polarization ; that is , @xmath212 for @xmath58 and @xmath213 for @xmath61 .",
    "as noted , @xmath61 decreases rapidly when @xmath75 becomes smaller ; for instance , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the results with hccs are rather different overlooked in the preliminary calculation reported there .",
    "] , : & & = ( -0.980.03 ) 10 ^ -3 , + & & p_= ( -1.73 0.05)10 ^ -3,[hccs ] + & & _ = 0.530.01 , [ hccsres]where , this time , the errors reflect the @xmath100-dependence .",
    "the @xmath33 remains the same as in eq.([rme ] ) .",
    "the presently available experimental data for @xmath58 @xcite is : p_^exp = ( -1.5 0.3)10 ^ -3.[pexp ] although the prediction in the hccs , ( [ hccs ] ) , gives a @xmath58 closer to ( [ pexp ] ) , we regard our mhccs result ( [ ourpred ] ) to be more reliable .",
    "the results of chen , rupak and savage @xcite for the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 computed in the pds counting scheme of @xcite are quite close to ours ( [ ourpred ] ) .",
    "even with the rather generous error estimates in @xcite taken into account , this agreement is remarkable .    while we believe that mhccs is more reliable than hccs",
    ", we should note that the mhccs and hccs results for @xmath66 differ by a factor of @xmath216 . to be conservative",
    ", we should take this difference as uncertainty in the treatment of the short - distance physics involved .",
    "( @xmath67 does not distinguish the two hard - core cutoff schemes . )",
    "this sort of uncertainty was implied in the chiral filter hypothesis of ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been mentioned in various places that , when protected by the chiral filter , the hccs procedure yields quantitatively accurate results .",
    "but the other side of the coin of the chiral filter suggests that the hccs procedure is likely to fail when unprotected by the chiral filter , as in the case of the isoscalar matrix elements at hand .",
    "our results here indicate how to understand the possible demise of the much used hard - core cutoff procedure , a procedure which has long been a standard method in nuclear physics , in terms of an effective field theory regularization .",
    "what comes out as a surprise from this work is that , despite the uncertainty due to the short - distance behavior , one can make a reasonably quantitative calculation of the observables that are _ not _ protected by the chiral filter mechanism .",
    "we await with great eagerness the forthcoming results of the ill experiment , which will bring crucial information on this issue .",
    "we would like to thank thomas m. mller for informing us of his experiment in progress and for useful discussions and martin savage for demonstrating to us the predictive power of the effective field theory approach he and his co - workers have developed .",
