    "a periodic non - autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation ( ode ) can be used to study seasonal variability in the field of climate science . in particular",
    ", the study of the seasonal variability of arctic sea ice , which shows large seasonal fluctuations , involves considering a periodic non - autonomous stochastic ode as a first order differential equation @xcite .",
    "however , the climate also contains slowly varying variabilities caused by ocean circulations or large - scale atmospheric low - frequencies @xcite , owing to which the inclusion of a long - term forcing should be considered into the related periodic non - autonomous stochastic ode to be more near to actual climate variability . along these lines , one of the key issues is determining how long - term forcing interacts with seasonality , and accordingly , influences seasonal variability .",
    "stochastic solutions without long - term forcing have been constructed in previous studies using a regular perturbation method based on the assumption that noise magnitude is much lesser than the degree of seasonal cycle @xcite .",
    "these approximate solutions reveal several important physical characteristics of seasonal variability , which is explained by the interaction between seasonal stability and noise forcing . in particular , the accumulation effect of the responses to noise forcing controlled by seasonal stability is the main physics towards understanding the seasonal evolution of stochastic solutions .",
    "the best example for the above generalised perspective is the seasonal variability of arctic sea ice . beginning from early summer",
    ", arctic sea ice becomes less stable or unstable due to sea ice albedo feedback , which implies that a decline in sea ice albedo induced by melting sea ice leads to more melting . during mid - summer",
    ", short - wave radiance increases rapidly in the arctic basin , and then , the intensity of the sea - ice albedo feedback is maximised .",
    "one might expect that the variance of arctic sea ice thickness is maximised in the middle of summer considering the stability and the noise magnitude ; however , the variance of sea ice thickness is maximised nearer to the end of summer .",
    "the responses of arctic sea ice to noise forcing accumulates until the sea ice albedo feedback almost vanishes , which normally happens nearer to the end of summer . this could be termed as the `` memory effect '' , which is well described in a previous research based on a delayed - integral form of stochastic solutions @xcite .    in spite of the success of the previous research in capturing the core of the seasonal variability of arctic sea ice",
    ", we have to consider a more realistic situation , i.e. , the seasonal cycle is influenced by various long - term forcing including ocean circulations or large - scale atmospheric low - frequencies .",
    "multi - fractal time - series analysis reveals that decadal time scales exist separately after showing the white noise characteristics between seasonal and bi - seasonal in arctic sea ice extent data @xcite , which may not be a special characteristic of arctic sea ice but a more general one in any climate phenomenon .",
    "hence , we can consider a minimal comprehensive model to address the issue regarding the interaction of low - frequencies and seasonal stochasticity .",
    "one possible approach is to consider simple long - term forcing represented as sinusoidal functions in the seasonal stochastic model .",
    "mathematically , it is the inclusion of an additional forcing term , whose magnitude slowly increases with time .",
    "seasonal variability could be different depending on the phase of the periodic low frequency .",
    "to analyse this effect explicitly , we need to find approximate solutions that include long - term forcing and then compare them with the original stochastic model without long - term forcing .",
    "based on the views discussed above , this research focusses on the construction of stochastic solutions for a periodic non - autonomous stochastic model that includes low - frequency forcing .",
    "previously , a regular perturbation method was applied to a given stochastic ode based on stochastic calculus @xcite .",
    "the shortcoming of the regular perturbation method for a stochastic ode is that one would need to deal with complicated integral equations of higher orders . to overcome this issue in the regular perturbation method , we use the equivalent fokker - planck equation , which provides us with a more direct and convenient method to calculate higher moments .    physically , the main issue is how long - term forcing interacts with seasonality and noise forcing .",
    "depending on the phase of the long - term forcing , the interaction could cause an increase or decrease in seasonal variability .",
    "this research investigates the influence the interaction with long - term forcing has on seasonal variability in detail , with regard to the stochastic model .",
    "moreover , we focus on the possibility that an increase in the seasonal variability is related to the occurrence of extreme events during a specific time period in a year .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows , in section [ sec : model ] , the formalism based on the fokker - planck equation is introduced .",
    "we show that this equivalent method also provides the same approximate solutions as that in previous research .",
    "the inclusion of long - term forcing is considered using the fokker - planck equation in section [ sec : longterm ] .",
    "here , we systematically interpret the new terms generated by the inclusion of long - term forcing .",
    "the solutions and the general interpretations of the given stochastic solutions are applied to the arctic sea ice model in section [ sec : seaice ] .",
    "finally , the implications of the results are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "a periodic non - autonomous 1-dimensional stochastic differential equation is generally represented as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is white noise and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are periodic functions . under the assumption that we already know the steady - state solution , @xmath4 , of the deterministic part and also that the magnitude of the noise term , @xmath5 , is small",

    "the characteristic equations are @xmath21 which leads to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant and @xmath24 after taking the inverse fourier transformation , the resulting solution is @xmath25    the fourier transform is applied again to @xmath26 , which leads to @xmath27 the resultant characteristic equations are @xmath28 the solution in the fourier domain is @xmath29 where @xmath30 after taking the inverse fourier transform of equation ( [ eqn : p1k ] ) , using the following relationships : @xmath31 we finally have @xmath32 hence , @xmath33 instead of @xmath16 , @xmath6 can be used to express @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 to compare the results with that of the previous research @xcite , we calculate several statistical moments , which are @xmath37 therefore , we obtain @xmath38 . these results are consistent with the previous research @xcite , which is based on a regular perturbation method in the original stochastic ode .",
    "now , we consider the inclusion of long - term forcing in the above stochastic model . in general , long - term forcing in a climate system can be a result of low - order chaotic systems .",
    "however , we consider the simplest form of long - term forcing , periodic low - frequency forcing , which can form the basis to understanding more complicated cases .      the relevant fokker - planck equation with simple periodic forcing is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the simple periodic forcing satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is important , here , to point out that periodic forcing has the same order of magnitude as noise forcing .",
    "although we can choose any scale for the magnitude of the periodic forcing , it is more realistic to choose the same order as that of the starting point .",
    "the difficulty in detecting low - frequencies in data comes from the speculation that seasonal variability masks low - frequencies , which simply leads to the assumption that the magnitude of low - frequencies is not bigger than that of seasonal variability .    rescaling @xmath6",

    "first , in the o(1 ) order , long - term forcing results in a deviation from the steady state solution .",
    "the deviation is represented by @xmath56 , which represents a combination of long - term forcing @xmath57 and periodic stability @xmath58 . under the assumption @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the period of @xmath58 , @xmath56",
    "is approximated as @xmath61 @xmath62 can be interpreted as a weighting factor controlled by the instantaneous stability , @xmath58 . as per the approximate solution",
    ", the response to long - term forcing has the same frequency as that of the forcing and its magnitude is weighted by the memory effect shaped by @xmath58 . in the @xmath15 order ,",
    "the role of long - term forcing is to move the mean slowly following the phase of the forcing , whereas the standard deviation remains same as in the case without long - term forcing .    in the next order @xmath26",
    ", long - term forcing begins interacting with the nonlinearity of the system and the multiplicative structure of the noise , which changes the standard deviation of the stochastic solution .",
    "moreover , a more complicated combination of long - term forcing and the stability , @xmath58 , tends to update the mean of the solution .",
    "we look into these parts in detail .",
    "first , we need to recollect that in the case without long - term forcing there is no change in standard deviation in the order @xcite .",

    "we can expect that as the order increases , the memory effects tend to be more complicatedly interlaced inside the integral .",
    "in the previous research @xcite , a generalised periodic non - autonomous stochastic model is applied to the arctic sea ice thickness model .",
    "arctic sea ice serves as a good example in the field of climate science for demonstrating distinct seasonal characteristics in terms of monthly stability @xmath58 .",
    "hence , it expresses the difference between an autonomous stochastic model and a periodic non - autonomous one with reasonable accuracy . in this research , it is also desirable to use the arctic sea ice model as an example to emphasise the role of seasonality with long - term forcing .",
    "further , the application of the previous general theory can also be considered in the study of climate science .",
    "a detailed model description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sea ice model is based on the energy heat flux balance between two boundaries in sea ice . on the boundary between sea ice and atmosphere , radiative ,",
    "sensible and latent heat fluxes are balanced by conductive heat flux in sea ice .",
    "similarly , there is a balance between oceanic turbulent heat flux and conductive heat flux on the boundary between ocean and sea ice .",
    "this overall balance is represented by a single periodic non - autonomous ode evolving the thickness of sea ice with seasonally - varying external fluxes .",
    "this energy flux balance induces a seasonal cycle of sea ice thickness . to observe the effect of global warming on sea ice , the additional heat flux , @xmath83 ,",
    "is included as a control parameter that ranges from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "short - time variabilities can be realised by stochastic noise forcing .",

    "the periodic function @xmath89 represents short - wave radiative flux evolving seasonally .",
    "the other term , @xmath90 , contains longwave radiative flux , turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes and meridional atmospheric heat flux from low - latitudes .",
    "short - wave radiative flux is controlled by the albedo , @xmath91 , which is a function of the sea ice energy , @xmath92 .",
    "oceanic turbulent heat flux is represented by the constant , @xmath93 ; further , sea ice export out of the arctic region , caused mainly by atmospheric large circulation , is also considered in the last term .",
    "the ramp function , @xmath94 , is used to initiate this term only when sea ice exists ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "these time - functions are constructed based on monthly - averaged observation data .",
    "the last term on the right side , @xmath96 , is stochastic forcing implying the effect of weather - related processes .",
    "based on observation data , it is realistic to assume that @xmath5 is quite small compared to the overall seasonal cycle of the main variable , @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath92 represents the latent heat stored in the sea ice when it is negative and it is the thermal energy stored in the ocean mixed layer when @xmath92 is positive .",

    ", we can see that the thickness of sea ice reflected in the steady state solutions decreases as the additional heat , @xmath83 , increases .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath83 increases , the absolute magnitude of @xmath58 also decreases , which indicates the weakening of the stability of sea ice ; then , @xmath58 becomes even positive during summer when @xmath83 is 18.0 .",
    "the nonlinearity , @xmath69 , shows more seasonality when @xmath83 increases , which is related to the asymmetric response of the sea ice albedo feedback during summer .",
    "based on the assumption that we already know the periodic steady state solution of the deterministic part , @xmath101 , we can consider a taylor expansion around the steady state , @xmath102 , to observe the variability around the solution due to small stochastic forcing .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath103 which leads to @xmath104 after introducing @xmath105",

    "the seasonal variability is more magnified during extreme phases .",
    "as @xmath58 has larger seasonal variability ( @xmath109 ) , the response to long - term forcing during extreme phases shows larger fluctuations .",
    "this is owing to a combination of the memory effect and the magnitude of the long - term forcing .",

    "the overall response to long - term forcing is maximised near extremes , similar to other quantities .    from the stochastic arctic sea ice model , we investigated the role of long - term forcing reflected in several statistical moments terms in each order . in the stochastic arctic sea ice model",
    ", the solutions became less stable and had larger seasonality as the additional heat flux @xmath83 increased .",
    "the seasonality of the stability , nonlinearity , and multiplicative noise characteristics interacts with long - term forcing , in which case the response of the seasonality is maximised near the extremes of the long - term forcing .",

    "the above theory yields approximate estimations of several statistical moments , standard deviation , mean , and skewness .",
    "we need to observe how the change in statistical moments by the inclusion of long - term forcing is projected in time - series .    to observe the effect of long - term forcing interacting with the seasonality in time - series",

    "in particular , the magnitude of @xmath69 is quite different for the two cases .",
    "according to the theory , long - term forcing is intertwined with @xmath69 in the memory kernel for changing the variance .",
    "the effect of the combination between long - term forcing and @xmath69 upon the time - series is realised by the sharp peaks in the time - series ( the red curve in ( b ) ) . in the narrow time domain , shown in ( e )",
    ", it is clearly seen that the increase or decrease of fluctuations is associated with the phase of long - term forcing . in this comparison",
    ", it is found that the interaction between the seasonality and long - term forcing results in the occurrence of large fluctuations phased with long - term forcing .",
    "the other comparisons shown in ( c ) and ( f ) also suggest the role of long - term forcing more clearly .",
    "the black curve is a case without long - term forcing and the red one with long - term forcing . because the magnitude of long - term forcing is not larger than noise forcing , the shift of the mean is not well detected owing to the existence of noise forcing . instead",
    ", the contribution of long - term forcing is represented by the intensified sharp signals following the phase of long - term forcing ( red curve in ( c ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "the other distinct characteristics is that the intensified signals shown in sharp peaks are concentrated near the end of summer in the seasonal time domain .",
    "owing to the memory effect , the extreme signals are shown to be concentrated when the seasonal variance is maximised .",
    "this is normally near the end of summer for the arctic sea ice .",
    "we also have to observe the situation wherein long - term forcing interacts with multiplicative noise structure . according to the theory",
    ", long - term forcing also interacts with multiplicative noise to shift the variance .",
    "we can rely on a similar comparison to observe the role of long - term forcing with multiplicative noise .",
    "the three models can be suggested as @xmath120 where @xmath113 and @xmath116 are used again and we use that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "however , the difference between the two cases is not significant compared to the case with nonlinearity , @xmath69 , with long - term forcing .",
    "another comparison between a case with long - term forcing ( red ) and the one without long - term forcing ( black ) is shown in ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "these two cases use the same random numbers for time advancing , and thus , short - time fluctuations appear almost the same .",
    "the distinct difference lies in the increase or decrease of the fluctuations depending on the phase of long - term forcing . however , the difference between the two cases is not distinctive compared with the previous case , which shows the interaction of long - term forcing with @xmath69 .    in this section ,",
    "the results imply that the interaction of long - term forcing with nonlinearity or multiplicative noise in the stochastic arctic sea ice model results in large unusual fluctuations in the seasonal time domain when the memory effect is maximised . owing to the small magnitude of long - term forcing compared with the size of background noise",
    ", it may be hard to detect the existence of long - term forcing using a simple spectrum analysis .",
    "the existence of long - term forcing seems to be realised by unusually large fluctuations at a specific time of a year .",
    "seasonality is a fundamental feature that needs to be considered , primarily when one observes any physical variables in our climate .",
    "seasonality is not an internal characteristic of a climate system but rather an externally - induced one .",
    "hence , periodic non - autonomous characteristics are inevitable in all of daily and monthly data spanning several decades . in this research , we investigate how seasonality can interact with long - term forcing based on a simple periodic non - autonomous stochastic model .    previously , a regular perturbation method is applied to a periodic non - autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation with small noise based on the rules of stochastic calculus . on the other hand",
    ", this research uses the equivalent fokker - planck equation , for which we rely on a singular perturbation method , fourier transformation , and the characteristics method .",
    "we prove that this different approach also yields the same approximate solutions as the previous one .",
    "the advantage of this method is its ability to directly calculate the probability density function , which enables us to avoid complicated calculations with stochastic calculus in high orders .",
    "we include a simple long - term forcing into the given periodic non - autonomous stochastic equation .",
    "we apply the fokker - planck equation formalism to find out stochastic solutions .",
    "simple long - term forcing modifies the original solutions .",
    "first , the stochastic mean changes slowly with the same phase as that of the long - term forcing .",
    "this effect is not necessarily unique in a periodic non - autonomous model but a common feature with an autonomous one .",
    "moreover , if long - term forcing is not significantly larger than background noise , the mean shift is not observed as a distinct feature .",
    "the uniqueness of the periodic non - autonomous stochastic ode with long - term forcing is in the @xmath26 order .",
    "the standard deviations change owing to long - term forcing combined with nonlinearity and multiplicative noise . without long - term forcing ,",
    "only the first two odd statistical moments are affected by the nonlinearity and multiplicative noise structure in the order .",
    "however , the inclusion of long - term forcing leads to a change in the standard deviation by the interaction of the long - term forcing with the nonlinearity and the multiplicative noise .",
    "the mean shift also exists in this order , but the expression is more complicated in its interaction with the memory effect .",
    "the next issue is determining how a change in standard deviation and the mean in this order is shown in the time - series generated by the periodic non - autonomous stochastic ode with long - term forcing .",
    "for this , the stochastic arctic sea ice model is used again to see the effect of long - term forcing in stochastic realisations . the weakened stability and intensified nonlinearity during summer combined with the extreme phases of long - term forcing generates sharp peaks in time series .",
    "the findings indicate that the unusual signals or events in a particular season could be due to the interaction of the intensified nonlinearity or the multiplicative noise with the phase of long - term forcing .",
    "even though it is almost impossible to observe the slow change of the mean in time - series , the occurrence of the unusual peaks during a specific time of a year may be used to determine the existence of long - term forcing statistically .",
    "moreover , we may explore the possibility that the knowledge of low - frequency leads to the prediction of unusual events for a specific year .",
    "owing to the complexity of the various scale interactions in our climate , it is difficult to say that the simple model approach represents the reality in a full range , but this result suggests important qualitative aspects of the seasonality influenced by a myriad of slowly varying physical processes . with different seasonal stability and nonlinearity and weather - like short - time processes",
    ", long - term forcing could contribute to not only long - term variability but also seasonal variability .",
    "in particular , long - term forcing may be related to the occurrence of extreme events represented as sharp peaks . in the future , it would be beneficial to extend this research with more complicated and realistic considerations ."
