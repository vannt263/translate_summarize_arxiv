    "many authors have proposed various theories of massive photons . in this paper , the topologically massive model associated with the axion field is studied . the axion electrodynamics is an extension of maxwell s electromagnetic theory that includes the dynamical axion term .",
    "the presence of the dynamical axion term means that the photon becomes topologically massive in the axion electrodynamics",
    ".    the axion term is also called the chern - simon ( cs ) term because of its origin . the chiral magnetic effect",

    "these studies reported that the observed shapiro step anomalies in all four experiments consistently point toward an axion mass of @xmath1 .",
    "as the author of @xcite pointed out , this result for the axion mass also needs to be examined from other viewpoints or experimentally .    in present paper",
    ", it has been shown that the relation of @xmath2 and axion mass @xmath3 in the bulk of superconductor from the beginning of the phase synchronizing condition and the london equations .",
    "these findings suggest the axions penetrate deep inside of the superconductor and @xmath2 enhances in the superconductor , and besides , it is probable that the measurement of the following modified london penetration depth allows the checking of presence of this phenomenon .    among the various possible effects of the axion field , we focus on the london penetration depth .",
    "superconductors have perfect diamagnetism , which is called the meissner effect .",
    "because of the meissner effect , the magnetic field does not penetrate deep inside of the superconductor , and the depth is called the london penetration depth .",
    "it is inferred from the presence of enhanced @xmath2 in the superconductor that the london penetration depth is due to the axion mass @xmath3 .",
    "this paper presents the simple classical results for the phase synchronization of bulk of superconductor and the london penetration depth of a type - i superconductor using the electromagnetic field theory , including the time - dependent axion field .",

    ". represents perfect diamagnetism . in the axion electrodynamics , the additional magnetic field on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is in the same direction as the current .",
    "namely , it is necessary to calculate the london penetration depth under slightly unusual conditions .",
    "this paper shows a method of deriving the modified london penetration depth under simple assumptions .",
    "let us now apply a rotation to both sides of eq . and substitute the perfect magnetism in the equation .",
    "the magnetic field equation is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are defined .",

    "our result is base on a new point of view , i.e. , the london equations .",
    "let us now consider the phase synchronization of the superconductor and axion decay .",
    "the superconductor is under the status of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , that implies the the phase @xmath49 of the wave function @xmath50 is synchronized on the bulk of the superconductor .",

    "if the incoming axions enter the superconductor , then the region around axions is the different phase to the external @xmath18 vacuum space .",
    "therefore , the phase difference @xmath54 emerges , and produces the weak link like region of the josephson junction in the superconductor .",
    "grant that this axion generated region is considered as weak link region of the josephson junction , the following equations holds , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the difference of a voltage of the inside of superconductor and the outside of the superconductor . from this relation",

    "the main key for describing the enhancement of the phase @xmath2 is the relation of the electromagnetic field and the current , i.e. , the london equations .",
    "the electric field in the superconductor obeys the london equation for the electric field : @xmath60 this equation implies that the time derivative of the density of the current produces the electric field @xmath61 , and the static current does not produce the electric field in the superconductor . from the phase synchronization condition @xmath62 , we get the relation of @xmath18 and @xmath63 , that are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "this equation means that the current is oscillation in the superconductor . here ,",
    "if this current @xmath63 is regard as the josephson junction current , we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this result implies that , in the region of surface to length @xmath79 , the current obey @xmath87 since the relation of @xmath18 and @xmath63 , and @xmath88 . using this relation , the entering axion generated magnetic field",

    "next , the length of the axions decay is estimated .",
    "we consider the situation that an axion is placed the surface of the superconductor at @xmath91 and has the velocity @xmath92 . from eq . , the time average of magnetic field in the weak link like region becomes @xmath93 in si units where @xmath94 is used .",

    "then the phase difference @xmath119 as many as an axion emerges on the weak link region of normal metal , which make the super current of josephson junction and the axion generated voltage @xmath120 .",

    ", this means a dc component only when @xmath124 , i.e. , when the dc voltage has the shapiro step values @xmath125 .",
