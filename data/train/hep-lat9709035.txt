    "improving the lattice qcd action using the method of lepage et al . @xcite and",
    "the perfect action method @xcite has allowed simulations with relatively large lattice spacings ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "while these methods have proved successful for lattice qcd with wilson @xcite or non - relativistic quarks @xcite they have been less successful for staggered ( kogut - susskind ) quarks @xcite .    improved staggered quark actions such as the naik(1 + 3-link ) @xcite , aimed at improving the fermion dispersion relations to bring them closer to their continuum form , do provide some improvement .",
    "however , they do not significantly decrease the flavour symmetry violations which plague the staggered quark action .",
    "the simplest of `` perfect '' actions also exhibit this deficiency @xcite .",
    "the reason appears to be that these actions concentrate on improving the low momentum dispersion relations for the fermions associated with the `` corners '' of the brillouin zone ( and the gauge fields ) and on making the interactions between low momentum fields more continuum - like .",
    "flavour symmetry violation occurs because the momentum transferred to the fermions by the gauge fields can change them from one flavour to another , and such transfers are not suppressed by such improvements .",
    "recently the milc @xcite collaboration have introduced an action where the gauge links in the staggered fermion action are replaced with a linear combination of a single gauge link and a sum over the six 3-link `` staples '' joining the same sites .",
    "this does appreciably decrease flavour symmetry violations as measured by the splitting between the goldstone and non - goldstone pions .",
    "the reason for this is clear .",
    "such a replacement effectively smooths the gauge field interaction with the fermions , thus reducing large momentum transfers at the vertex responsible for flavour symmetry breaking .",
    "we have improved on this scheme in a systematic fashion . at tree level",
    ", our scheme suppresses flavour symmetry breaking by an additional power of @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that an action of the same form , but with different coefficients , is the appropriate choice beyond tree level .",
    "the 4 flavours and 4 dirac components in one staggered fermion are associated with the 16 poles of the free propagator . for massless quarks",
    "these occur at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , at weak coupling , we can suppress flavour mixing to higher order in @xmath4 if we can suppress coupling to gluons which couple the neighbourhood of one of these poles to any other .",
    "in particular we should suppress coupling to gluons with momentum components @xmath5 or @xmath6 , but not all zero .    to see how to do this",
    "let us ignore , for the moment , the complications of gauge invariance .",
    "then the coupling of the gluon and quark fields would be of the form @xmath7 we could then achieve our objective by making the substitution @xmath8 where @xmath9 then in momentum space @xmath10 which vanishes when any component of @xmath11 is @xmath6 , and @xmath12 as @xmath13 . for",
    "@xmath11 having any component within @xmath14 of @xmath6 , the coupling is suppressed by @xmath15 .",
    "thus this substitution would achieve precisely what we want .",
    "note also that adding a fermion mass shifts the poles in the fermion propagator by @xmath14 , and so does not invalidate these arguments .    to make this approach gauge invariant",
    ", we replace @xmath16 by the standard gauge link variable @xmath17 .",
    "the displacement operators @xmath18 are replaced by covariant displacement operators , for example @xmath19 as one moves away from weak coupling , the coefficients in this new action will develop @xmath20 dependence , so that these coefficients are considered as free parameters to be adjusted to minimize flavour symmetry violations .",
    "equation  [ eqn : naive ] then becomes @xmath21                                                                      \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\hspace{-.1 in } + \\sum_{\\nu\\rho } [ x_2 d_{\\nu\\rho } + y_2 ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho }                                              + d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho } ) ]    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\hspace{-.1 in } + \\sum_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda } [ x_3 d_{\\nu\\rho\\lambda }     + y_3 ( d_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda}+d_{-\\mu\\nu\\rho\\lambda})]\\ } u_\\mu \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are summed over @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 all different , and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 s acting on @xmath35 displace it in each of the subscript directions .",
    "products of @xmath36 s join the ends of the displaced link to the sites at the ends of the undisplaced @xmath35 so as to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "to reduce the number of independent parameters , we symmetrize over all such minimal length paths joining the undisplaced sites to displaced sites . in general",
    ", we could assign different weights to such paths , provided we preserved lattice symmetries .",
    "the tree level values for these coefficients are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the milc action has @xmath37 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the first check of this fermion action is to see that it does indeed suppress coupling to gluons with momentum components @xmath5 or @xmath6 but not all zero , in the weak coupling limit when the coefficients are set to their tree values . for this",
    "we use the weak coupling approximation @xmath44 and expand @xmath45 to first order in @xmath16 .",
    "since we are dealing with non - gauge - invariant quantities , we work in landau gauge . in this approximation @xmath46 vanishes at @xmath47 , except when @xmath48 , which is the required result .",
    "the true test of this new action is how it reduces the flavour symmetry violation , as measured by the @xmath49 ",
    "@xmath6 mass difference for values of @xmath50 where this splitting is quite large for the standard action @xcite .",
    "we have measured the spectrum of local light hadrons on an ensemble of 203 quenched configurations generated with the standard action at @xmath0 on an @xmath51 lattice .",
    "we have used the standard staggered quark action , the milc action and our new improved action , for various values of their parameters . for the results presented here , we used a 1 parameter subset of improved actions for which @xmath52 , @xmath53 . for the milc actions @xmath37 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , as mentioned above .",
    "we plot the standard action results for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in figure  1 , along with those for milc1 ( the milc action with @xmath56 ) and imp2 ( our improved action with @xmath57 ) , which show the most improvement of those actions we have considered in each class .",
    "since the @xmath23 mass for the standard action , extrapolated to @xmath58 , is @xmath59 larger than that for the milc or improved actions , we should really compare these with standard action results from a lattice with @xmath59 larger lattice spacing , where the improvement will be less dramatic .",
    "however , a reduction of @xmath6@xmath49 mass splitting of a factor of 2 for the milc actions , as reported at @xmath60 by the milc collaboration seems likely .",
    "since the @xmath23 masses for the milc and improved actions are very close , a direct comparison of @xmath6@xmath49 mass splittings is justified .",
    "looking at an extrapolation to zero quark mass suggests that our improved action could reduce this mass splitting by around 40% .",
    "actions which are designed to systematically suppress the coupling of high - momentum gluons , which give rise to flavour symmetry violations , reduce flavour symmetry violations in the pion mass spectrum by @xmath61 over the milc action , and hence by a factor of @xmath62 over the normal staggered fermion action , on quenched configurations at @xmath0 . we are repeating these calculations on a larger lattice ( @xmath63 ) to remove finite size effects .",
