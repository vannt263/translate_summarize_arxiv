    "this needs to be understood properly before making any quantitative conclusions regarding the radial flow .",
    "such broadening of @xmath0 is thought to arise due to successive collisions in nuclear reactions .",
    "it is basically an initial state collision broadening of @xmath0 .",
    "this effect in high @xmath0 ( typically above 2 gev ) is referred to as cronin effect  @xcite .",

    "we discuss the random walk model .",

    "if a nucleon starts with zero @xmath0 , after the first collision the next one will generally occur at some non - vanishing transverse velocity .",
    "thus there is a gain in transverse momentum through successive collisions .",
    "the propagation of nucleon through successive collisions is assumed to follow a @xmath3 pattern .",
