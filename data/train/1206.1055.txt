    "quantum hall effects are the best known experimentally observed manifestations of electron fractionalization above one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "it is believed that similar fractionalization is also possible in materials with strong spin - orbit coupling that realize a new class of topological insulators ( tis ) with time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "all currently known tis are _ uncorrelated _ band - insulators @xcite .",
    "quantum wells made from these materials feature electron dynamics that somewhat resembles integer quantum hall states , most notably by exhibiting protected gapless edge modes @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to respecting the tr symmetry the new tis differ from quantum hall systems by the character of their spectra and by lacking the conservation of `` charge '' whose role is played by the electron s spin . the latter prevents observing a quantized spin hall conductivity in two spatial dimensions and reduces the number of stable uncorrelated insulating quantum phases from infinity to only two @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper are _ strongly correlated _ tis in two spatial dimensions whose excitations carry a fraction of electron s charge and exhibit unconventional exchange statistics @xcite .",
    "this research is motivated both by the fundamental quest for unconventional quantum states of matter and by potential future applications in spintronics and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the central problem we address is the classification of topological orders in the ground states of interacting particles .",
    "we loosely define topological orders as distinct manifestations of macroscopic many - body quantum entanglement that can not be altered by tuning topologically unbiased hamiltonians without going through a quantum phase transition .",
    "topological orders are expressed in the phenomena such as the fractional exchange statistics of quasiparticles and the ground - state degeneracy without symmetry breaking on non - simply connected spaces .",
    "we will argue that novel kinds of topological order are made possible by the rashba spin - orbit coupling in tis , whose description requires a generalization of the chern - simons ( cs ) effective theory .",
    "our main goal is then to construct a more general topological field theory that can capture a sufficiently broad spectrum of conventional and topological orders .",
    "we will discuss examples of spin entanglement that have no analogue in fractional quantum hall states ( fqhs ) , but a systematic classification of such states is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "fractional tis can exist in various systems , and likely will be observed in the foreseeable future .",
    "there are at least three prominent approaches to obtaining fractional tis in solid state materials .",
    "the earliest one relies on coulomb interactions to facilitate spin - charge separation in materials with geometrically frustrated local magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "electrons can be fractionalized into neutral spinons and spinless charge - modes without a spin - orbit coupling , but gapped spinons can additionally exhibit the ti dynamics in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a more recent approach explores lattice models with fractional excitations , the so called chern insulators @xcite .",
    "such models can be tr - invariant and generally rely on narrow bands in the electron spectrum to create favorable conditions for fractional ground states .",
    "there are a few proposals of materials that could realize fractionalization using artificially created narrow bands @xcite .",
    "the third approach is to use the currently available band - insulating ti materials and artificially induce electron correlations by a proximity effect in a heterostructure device .",
    "for example , a conventional superconductor placed in contact with a ti quantum well can induce superconductivity or leave behind an insulating state inside the ti .",
    "a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition inside the ti can be tuned by a gate voltage , and it turns out that it would belong to the bosonic mean - field or xy universality class in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this quantum critical point is sensitive to perturbations , and correlated `` pseudogap '' topological states can be born out of its quantum critical fan as a result of the spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "candidate states are fractional tis of spinful @xmath0-wave cooper pairs whose existence is allowed by the tis orbital degrees of freedom and low - energy dynamics enhanced by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a similar correlated ti of excitons could be envisioned in the device proposed by seradjeh , @xcite .",
    "another promising system are ultra - cold gases of bosonic atoms trapped in quasi 2d optical lattices .",
    "superfluid to mott insulator transitions can be easily arranged to remove any energy scales that could compete with the spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and thus create similar conditions as in the proximity effect heterostructures .",
    "at the same time , the recent development of artificial gauge fields for neutral atoms , created by stimulated raman transitions between internal atomic states , has not only introduced the effective spin - orbit couplings @xcite , but also looks very promising for generating locally enhanced flux densities needed for fractional states @xcite .",
    "the current theoretical studies of two - dimensional strongly correlated tis are based entirely on adapting the well - known descriptions of fqhs to the tr - symmetry @xcite .",
    "this approach is certainly well motivated , but the fact is that no experimental observations of fractional tr - invariant tis have been made to date .",
    "quantum hall systems are sufficiently different from the spin - orbit - coupled materials that we must question their validity as an experimental basis for the complete theory of fractional tis .",
    "specifically , we will argue in this paper that the dirac spectra of surface electrons in tis pave the way to topological orders that can not be fully captured by the standard cs effective theory , which is better suited to systems with landau levels .",
    "we will instead view the two - dimensional tis as manifestations of the su(2 ) `` quantum hall physics '' , created by an su(2 ) `` magnetic field '' that implements the spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "some idealized su(2 ) incompressible quantum liquids are quantum hall states because they exhibit a quantized hall conductivity of spin currents .",
    "however , the hall response quantization is a symmetry - protected feature , lost due to spin non - conserving perturbations that unavoidably exist in materials .",
    "interestingly , the non - commutative character of the su(2 ) gauge fields enables incompressible quantum liquids without a quantum hall effect even in the absence of unwanted perturbations .",
    "all presently available two - dimensional tis can be viewed as the non - quantum - hall analogues of `` integer '' quantum spin - hall states , where the rashba spin - orbit su(2 ) `` magnetic flux '' creates a dirac rather than a landau - like electron spectrum .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is then to construct and begin exploring a new topological quantum field theory that can naturally describe both the fractional quantum - hall and non - quantum - hall states .",
    "our ambition here is to systematically capture the _ topological _ properties of a broad class of states in a relatively simple manner .",
    "this theory will help us predict the topological orders which may be specific to the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we will take guidance from the experimentally established facts about the available ti materials and construct a theory that can address all of the above candidate systems for tr - invariant fractional incompressible quantum liquids .",
    "this topological field theory will have a general form applicable to interacting elementary particles with arbitrary charge and spin , whose dynamics is restricted to two spatial dimensions and affected by any type of spin - orbit coupling or magnetic field or both .",
    "we will use it to show that correlated tis can feature excitations with fractional charge , spin and exchange statistics , despite the spin non - conservation .",
    "we will make predictions about the fractional excitation quantum numbers in relation to symmetries , possible symmetry breaking , as well as cooper or exciton pairing in topologically - enhanced ground states .",
    "we will demonstrate the relationship of this topological field theory to the standard cs gauge theories , and point to limitations of the latter to adequately model all possible tr - invariant tis .",
    "for the purpose of focusing on bulk topological orders , we will view all states of interest here as fractional tis regardless of whether they have gapless edge states or not , and thus depart from the terminology introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will set up the formalism for analyzing both the abelian and non - abelian topological orders , including hierarchical states and incompressible quantum liquids specific to su(@xmath1 ) fluxes and the rashba spin - orbit coupling , which may have no analogue in the quantum hall states .",
    "the field theory we propose can also describe conventional quantum phases , and possibly the universal aspects of phase transitions to topological states",
    ". it may be able to provide a broad classification scheme for topological states of quantum matter , analogous to that provided by landau - ginzburg theories of symmetry - broken states .",
    "this introductory section describes the effective field theory of correlated two - dimensional tis that we propose , explains the principles of its construction , and relates it to other works .",
    "the structure of the paper s technical parts is outlined near the section end .",
    "understanding complex emergent phenomena directly from microscopic models can be extremely difficult .",
    "it is often much more practical to study emergent and universal phenomena using effective theories that specialize to the low energy parts of spectra .",
    "an effective lagrangian can be constructed in the continuum limit by introducing field operators to quantize the classical equations of motion , and by collecting all combinations of fields that respect the required symmetries .",
    "this method , pioneered in high - energy physics and the theory of critical phenomena , is the basis of the present analysis .",
    "the topological term @xmath17 , allowed by symmetries , shapes the quantum kinematics of dual topological defects in the @xmath6 field configurations @xcite .",
    "it is inconsequential in conventional phases such as superconductors and mott - insulators , but affects the quasiparticle statistics in incompressible quantum liquids .",
    "the static u(1)@xmath18su(2 ) gauge field @xmath19 implements any combination of external electromagnetic fields and spin - orbit couplings .",
    "its components are su(2 ) matrices , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are scalars and @xmath23 are three su(2 ) generators in the spin-@xmath8 representation ( angular momentum matrices ; @xmath24 ) .",
    "the flux components of non - abelian gauge fields are @xmath25 in the matrix representation .",
    "the temporal `` magnetic '' component @xmath26 of the external flux density is inserted in the topological term @xmath17 to ensure its adequate transformation under tr ( @xmath27 is the levi - civita tensor in ( 2 + 1)d space - time )",
    ". there are four possible insertion points , and @xmath17 is symmetrized with respect to them using anticommutators ( braces ) .",
    "if all components of @xmath19 commute with each other , then the topological term can be reduced to the cs form when the phase fluctuations in the spinor @xmath6 components drive the dynamics .",
    "it turns out , however , that the @xmath19 appropriate for solid state tis have non - commuting components .",
    "the topological term @xmath17 is the main new ingredient in a field theory of this kind and we will devote most of the discussion in this paper to its derivation and consequences",
    ". we will derive it using the same field - theoretical principles that yield the cs theories of fqhs , but applied in the context of spinor rather than gauge fields .",
    "the standard effective field theory of fqhs is a pure gauge theory in which the cs coupling acts as a topological term that implements a fractional exchange statistics .",
    "the cs theory is constructed from the requirement that the action be stationary when the hall conductivity and incompressible electron density are quantized as observed in fqhs experiments @xcite .",
    "this requirement can be stated in an alternative form .",
    "electrons in mutually perpendicular electric @xmath28 and magnetic @xmath29 fields generally have classical cyclotron trajectories whose orbit centers move at the constant velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting drift current is precisely reproduced by the kinematic equations of motion that make the cs action stationary .",
    "we will seek the analogous drift currents of spin - orbit - coupled particles in the section [ secqm ] .",
    "our starting point will be the minimal model hamiltonian of two - dimensional topological band - insulators , which is by now well established experimentally .",
    "this hamiltonian can be written in the form that couples electrons to an external static su(2 ) gauge field with a finite `` magnetic '' flux density .",
    "we will derive the time - evolution of various current operators in the heisenberg picture from a generic hamiltonian of this type .",
    "the obtained equations of motion have a direct classical interpretation according to the ehrenfest s theorem",
    ". we will extract from them the topologically protected features of dynamics in the combined u(1)@xmath18su(2 ) `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "we will discover that topologically quantized constant drift currents and hall effects are possible only when the appropriate gauge charges ( charge and spin ) are conserved .",
    "focusing first on this special case , we will show in the section [ sectft ] that the drift component of motion agrees with the stationary action condition applied to the topological term of ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "this will justify @xmath17 as an effective field theory of quantum hall and spin - hall effects that can replace the cs theory ( later in the paper we will separately show how @xmath17 can describe fractionalization , hierarchical quantum hall states , etc . ) .",
    "if the above had been our only goal , we would have been able to construct the effective topological lagrangian @xmath17 by directly considering the spin - hall conductivity .",
    "however , we wish to also describe topological states that feature no quantum hall effect , so only the su(2 ) symmetry can guide us .",
    "the drift current analysis helps us to transparently construct @xmath17 for any representation of any gauge symmetry group that allows a quantum hall effect .",
    "having spinors , we can easily describe particles of arbitrary charge and spin moving in any combination of u(1 ) electromagnetic , su(2 ) spin - orbit and other fields .",
    "now that @xmath17 formally has the su(2 ) gauge symmetry in any desired representation , we can directly apply it to the fractional tis with the non - commutative gauge fields of the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the ensuing spin non - conservation ruins the quantum spin - hall effect , but any incompressible quantum liquid in which individual particles become microscopic cyclotron vortices will have excitations whose fractional statistics is topologically protected and correctly captured by @xmath17 .",
    "we will , therefore , have a tool that is more general than the cs theory and capable of handling the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the construction of @xmath17 will make it clear that the fields @xmath6 are not the ordinary field operators of particles , but rather the dual field operators that represent vortices .",
    "their dynamics is provided by the non - topological part @xmath9 of ( [ toplg ] ) in the most general landau - ginzburg form allowed by symmetries .",
    "the gauge field @xmath31 implements the magnus force on vortices in this language .",
    "note that @xmath9 governs the dynamics of smooth configurations of @xmath6 , while @xmath17 is sensitive only to singular configurations .",
    "for this reason , the stationary action conditions for @xmath9 and @xmath17 are essentially independent .",
    "the topological theory dual to ( [ toplg ] ) and expressed in terms of the particle field operators is given by the lagrangian density ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "the quantization of classical equations of motion , which we apply to obtain the quantum field theory of tis , rests upon knowing the exchange statistics of elementary objects .",
    "the lagrangians ( [ toplg ] ) with and without the topological term @xmath17 quantize the same classical system using different state - dependent exchange statistics .",
    "therefore , the role of @xmath17 is to specify quantum statistics and other fundamentally non - classical aspects of dynamics .",
    "this is done in a manner that depends on the presence and density of topological defects in the field @xmath6 configuration , which is a desirable property of a general theory that should describe fractional ground states .",
    "in contrast , the cs theory has a rigid implementation of statistics , specific to only one particular fractional ground state .    when employed in the context of fqhs , the theory ( [ toplg ] ) is closely related to the cs landau - ginzburg lagrangian of wen and niu from the ref.@xcite .",
    "going beyond this formal similarity , ( [ toplg ] ) is an effective theory in exactly the same sense as the cs theory in wen s treatment of fqhs @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that ( [ toplg ] ) naturally generalizes the cs theories of abelian fqhs to non - abelian incompressible quantum liquids of particles with arbitrary internal degrees of freedom .",
    "likely descriptions of non - abelian fqhs in the present formalism @xcite seem to be somewhat different than other proposed field theories involving non - abelian gauge fields @xcite .",
    "no explicit assumptions about microscopic dynamics , such as the existence of composite bosons or fermions , are made in the construction of ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "this marks a contrast to several other approaches to fqhs that use cs gauge fields , including landau - ginzburg - cs @xcite , and `` hamiltonian '' @xcite theories .",
    "the present effective field theory is also complementary to microscopic wavefunction constructions @xcite .",
    "it is better suited for the systematic prediction , classification and qualitative characterization of new possible topological orders , than for describing microscopic realizations of topological states with quantitative accuracy .",
    "being not restricted to topological states in flat bands , this theory is a valuable tool for exploring the uncharted territory of tr - invariant fractional tis .    the technical part of this paper begins with an introduction to the su(2 ) gauge - field description of spin - orbit couplings in the section [ secqm ] .",
    "a simple single - particle quantum mechanics is used there to establish the equation of motion for electrons in external electromagnetic and spin - orbit fields .",
    "the following section [ sectft ] explains how symmetries and the equations of motion can be used to construct the field theory ( [ toplg ] ) , and especially its topological term .",
    "the next major subject of the paper are certain essential properties of the theory and its initial predictions in the context of the simplest laughlin - type topological orders .",
    "we will first apply fundamental principles in the section [ secfract ] to show that fractionalization is mandated in a class of correlated quantum states that bridge between the phases of maximally localized and maximally delocalized particles .",
    "these include the fractional tis without spin - conservation that could arise in solid - state materials",
    ". then , we will discuss in the section [ seccs ] how and in what special circumstances the cs theories arise from ( [ toplg ] ) as effective descriptions of fractionalized states .",
    "such circumstances are not met in the currently available tis , and we will identify in the section [ sectopord ] a special dynamical symmetry of the rashba spin - orbit coupling that can lead to new but utterly fragile topological quantum phases beyond the pure cs description .",
    "the following section [ secdeg ] verifies the existence of topological order in all these phases by calculating their ground - state degeneracy on a torus and other non - simply connected surfaces . finally , the section [ secdual ] formally derives the topological field theory of physical particles dual to ( [ toplg ] ) , and takes a bigger perspective on the relationship between quantum hall states and conventional phases of matter .",
    "we will touch upon the possibility of revealing the origins of fractionalization in dynamics .",
    "the stability of topological orders against perturbations that violate the su(2 ) gauge structure is briefly discussed in the section [ secstab ] from the duality point of view .",
    "the following segment of the paper goes beyond the laughlin - type topological orders and explores the ways in which the proposed effective theory ( [ toplg ] ) can be generalized to describe arbitrary abelian hierarchical quantum hall states ( section [ sechier ] ) and many non - abelian ones ( sections [ secnonabel ] and [ tinonabel ] ) .",
    "we will demonstrate how the generalized topological term of ( [ toplg ] ) can shape unconventional quantum statistics once the dynamics governed by the landau - ginzburg part selects appropriate low - energy fluctuations of the spinor fields .",
    "we will discuss in greater detail a class of novel and robust non - abelian topological orders that can arise specifically due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "all conclusions and an outlook of the many remaining issues are summarized in the section [ secconcl ] .",
    "the simplest model of a quantum well made from a topological band - insulator material such as bi@xmath32se@xmath33 or bi@xmath32te@xmath33 is given by the hamiltonian : @xmath34 the four - component spinor wavefunction @xmath35 captures electron s internal states labeled by the spin projection @xmath36 , and the orbital index @xmath37 that can be interpreted as the top or bottom surface of the quantum well .",
    "the vector spin operator is @xmath38 , @xmath24 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are pauli matrices that act on spin and orbital degrees of freedom respectively ( we set @xmath41 ) . in a bulk crystal",
    ", the two surfaces would be far apart and decoupled ( @xmath42 ) , so their energy spectrum @xmath43 would contain massless dirac states with the helical correlation @xmath44 between momentum and spin .",
    "assuming that the chemical potential @xmath45 were placed well within the bulk bandgap , the above hamiltonian would then consistently describe the low - energy part of the full spectrum that contains only the surface states .",
    "however , electrons in a quantum well can tunnel between the two surfaces ( @xmath46 ) , which opens up a gap in the dirac spectrum of surface states .",
    "a two - dimensional band - insulator can be obtained by pushing @xmath45 into this tunneling bandgap in a gated heterostructure .",
    "the given hamiltonian is the minimal model of 2d electrons that both experience a spin - orbit coupling and have a finite bandgap without violating the tr symmetry .",
    "it has identical spectrum to the model of hgte quantum wells introduced by bernevig , @xcite , and may be considered different from it only by the choice of representation .",
    "experimental evidence for the validity of this model comes both from bulk systems and quantum wells @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ bernevig ] ) is related to a gauge theory for electrons in a static external su(2 ) gauge field @xmath47 .",
    "consider : @xmath48 where @xmath49 the su(2 ) charge @xmath50 operates in the orbital subspace , and @xmath19 are su(2 ) matrices derived from spin operators .",
    "gauge transformations are specified by three angles @xmath51 combined into an su(2 ) transformation matrix @xmath52 : @xmath53 for spin @xmath54 particles , the su(2 ) generators are @xmath55 .",
    "the hamiltonians ( [ bernevig ] ) and ( [ gaugeth ] ) produce the same operator equation of motion @xmath56 in the heisenberg picture for the current ( velocity ) operator @xmath57 : @xmath58 the symbol @xmath59 is the 2d antisymmetric tensor that implements vector cross products in the einstein notation .",
    "this equation of motion ( written at @xmath60 ) illustrates the quantum cyclotron dynamics of electrons in its dependence on the spin and orbital index @xmath37 , which is the fundamental origin of all topological properties .",
    "in particular , we can immediately see the tendency of acceleration @xmath61 to be perpendicular to the particle s momentum @xmath62 , and its dependence on the spin @xmath36 that embodies the tr - invariance .",
    "note , however , that spin precession is not properly taken into account here ( will be in the subsequent analysis ) . from the gauge theory perspective",
    ", the cyclotron dynamics is caused by the presence of a finite su(2 ) `` magnetic '' flux density : @xmath63 the non - abelian nature of su(2 ) gauge fields allows a finite flux even when the gauge field is uniform .",
    "gauge transformations ( [ gaugetransf ] ) merely rotate the flux in a spatially dependent way , @xmath64 .",
    "the model ( [ gaugeth ] ) is different from ( [ bernevig ] ) by the extra @xmath65 term and a constant .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath66 determines the curvature of electron band - dispersions @xmath67 at larger momenta , which is indeed seen in arpes experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can regard ( [ gaugeth ] ) as a more accurate description of realistic systems than ( [ bernevig ] ) , and take advantage of having the parameter @xmath66 to define the cyclotron frequency scale and flux density .",
    "this will prove extremely useful in building the topological field theory of correlated tis .",
    "the gauge model ( [ gaugeth ] ) should be considered valid only below a cutoff momentum scale @xmath68 in order to ensure a true bandgap @xmath69 and a natural shape of the valence band .",
    "such a cutoff is indeed produced by the crystal lattice of a realistic system .",
    "the presence of a bandgap is essential for the existence of topologically non - trivial insulating states .",
    "we must note that realistic systems do not have the su(2 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "still , their topological properties can be protected as long as the perturbations to @xmath70 that violate the gauge symmetry do not remove the su(2 ) flux .",
    "we shall postpone the discussion of gauge - symmetry violations to the section [ secstab ] and focus first on the pure charge and spin hall effects .",
    "we will explore the combined effects of spin - orbit couplings and external electromagnetic fields on any particles by generalizing the hamiltonian to the u(1)@xmath18su(2 ) symmetry group with arbitrary spin @xmath8 representation .",
    "band - insulating solid state tis exhibit a particular realization of an su(2 ) `` magnetic '' field .",
    "we will consider more general situations in the following , described by the hamiltonian of particles that have both an electromagnetic u(1 ) charge @xmath71 and spin - orbit su(2 ) charge @xmath50 : @xmath72 this is sufficient for analyzing the cyclotron motion that stands behind all topological phenomena .",
    "we will implicitly assume the existence of internal degrees of freedom and microscopic features that are necessary to open a topological gap and stabilize a ti ground state .",
    "the general u(1)@xmath18su(2 ) gauge field @xmath73 carries flux : @xmath74 its u(1 ) and su(2 ) parts will be labeled by lowercase and uppercase symbols respectively , and @xmath23 for @xmath24 are the three su(2 ) generators ( angular momentum operators ) in any spin-@xmath8 representation .",
    "the temporal @xmath75 and spatial @xmath76 flux matrices correspond to `` magnetic '' @xmath77 and @xmath78-rotated `` electric '' @xmath79 fields respectively , which together form the field tensor @xmath80 : @xmath81 the traces of @xmath82 contain the u(1 ) electromagnetic fields @xmath83 , while their traceless parts contain the analogous spin - dependent su(2 ) fields .",
    "only the eigenvalues of @xmath84 ( and @xmath80 ) are gauge - invariant . defining the charge @xmath85 and",
    "spin @xmath86 current operators , @xmath87 we obtain the following heisenberg equation of motion for the spatial current components from ( [ u1su2 ] ) : @xmath88 one should keep in mind that all operators in this equation are expressed at time @xmath89 in the heisenberg picture , including the flux operators @xmath90 which will precess if @xmath91 and @xmath84 do not commute .",
    "we will solve this differential equation for @xmath92 treated as a matrix function of time .",
    "the expectation value @xmath93 calculated from the solution @xmath92 in any state @xmath94 will properly reflect the quantum time - evolution of currents , as well as the behavior of an equivalent classical system according to the ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "let us first consider the special case of spin - conserving gauge fields @xmath95 whose components commute with each other .",
    "the resulting flux operators commute with the hamiltonian , so that @xmath96 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "writing @xmath97 and organizing the scalars @xmath98 and @xmath99 into an eight - component vector @xmath100 reduces ( [ heisenberg ] ) to linear differential equations with constant coefficients whose matrix form and solution are : @xmath101 all eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath102 are purely imaginary and thus generate cyclotron oscillations .",
    "the resulting heisenberg current operator is @xmath103 where the first term describes cyclotron motion with frequencies @xmath104 , @xmath105 and amplitudes @xmath106 appropriate for circular classical trajectories . the second term @xmath107 is a constant drift current perpendicular to both `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "note that @xmath107 is state - independent and thus topologically protected , unlike the cyclotron orbit amplitudes @xmath108 .",
    "we will now concentrate on the drift current kinematics . setting @xmath109 in ( [ heisenberg ] ) and @xmath110 in ( [ eqmotsol ] )",
    ", we easily find : @xmath111 it is not hard to recognize that this equation indirectly describes the quantum hall effect .",
    "the amount of drift current is completely determined by the `` magnetic field '' ( perpendicular to the sample s plane ) and the in - plane `` electric field '' perpendicular to the current flow . the coefficients @xmath112 can be calculated by expanding both sides of this equation in the powers of @xmath113 , and noting that there are only @xmath7 independent matrices among @xmath114 in the spin @xmath8 representation . we will not pursue this expansion . instead",
    ", we will need a slightly different formula @xmath115 which is obtained by inserting @xmath116 and its inverse into ( [ dj ] ) .",
    "now let us briefly consider the analogous dynamics of rashba spin - orbit - coupled electrons . the gauge field ( [ asolid ] ) produces the hamiltonian ( [ u1su2 ] ) that does not commute with the flux operators ( [ u1su2flux0 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the heisenberg - picture operator @xmath117 in ( [ heisenberg ] ) has a non - trivial time dependence .",
    "the proper way to evolve the gauge field operators is to treat the time evolution in the heisenberg picture as a generalized gauge transformation that leaves all equations of motion invariant and ensures that all measurable ( gauge - invariant ) observables evolve according to @xmath118 : @xmath119 we can handle the flux precession by formally seeking the time - dependent operator solutions in the schrodinger picture , where the flux operators are static : @xmath120 like before , we can expand @xmath121 as in ( [ currentexpand ] ) to reduce the above equation to the form ( [ lde ] ) .",
    "its solution for @xmath122 must then be used to obtain the heisenberg - picture operator @xmath92 that properly captures the full dynamics .",
    "it is not useful for the purpose of this paper to calculate the detailed and complicated expression for @xmath92 .",
    "we will , however , benefit from revealing some qualitative properties of the dynamics shaped by the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "first , the residual commutator @xmath123 in ( [ schrodinger ] ) introduces the momentum operator into the general solutions for @xmath92 , because the spin - orbit coupling is proportional to momentum but also contains the spin operators that do not commute with the flux ( [ u1su2flux0 ] ) .",
    "this means that all aspects of the current dynamics explicitly depend on the electrons momenta .",
    "second , even the constant drift component of @xmath124 is turned into an oscillating current in @xmath125 .",
    "the only way to obtain a constant current that satisfies ( [ schrodinger ] ) is to insist on @xmath126 .",
    "it can be easily seen that such solutions are possible when @xmath127 , but they are not topologically protected because they can have any amplitude independent of the fluxes .",
    "therefore , this dynamics does not feature a quantum hall effect .",
    "there are certain topologically - protected aspects of the dynamics , but they are buried in the oscillatory and momentum - dependent motion of electrons such as spin precession .",

    "the symmetry of @xmath290 is `` geometrical '' , while the symmetry of @xmath292 is `` dynamical '' . @xmath308 and @xmath309 could also be the ground states of a globally su(2 ) symmetric hamiltonian in different parameter regimes , in which case they would be separated by at least one symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "the qualitative difference between @xmath308 and @xmath309 could be very deep , depending on the dynamics .",
    "for example , one would expect that the most stable topological orders in @xmath290 typically feature abelian quasiparticle statistics , while @xmath292 could dynamically prefer quantum liquids with non - abelian statistics that we will discuss in the section [ tinonabel ] .",
    "however , here we will consider the minimal possible difference between @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "we will assume that both ground states can be characterized by the same quantized vortex densities @xmath175 in the @xmath310 spin channels , according to ( [ densityquant ] ) .",
    "we will justify the validity of this assumption only in the section [ secstab ] .    the simplest minimally different ground states @xmath306 are both uncorrelated or laughlin quantum liquids whose excitations can exhibit charge and spin fractionalization given by ( [ quantnum ] ) .",
    "however , their specific symmetries affect the statistics of measurement outcomes in an observable way .",
    "suppose that one could prepare the system by exciting a particular fractional quasiparticle @xmath311 with desired quantum numbers above the ground state .",
    "the excitation @xmath312 of the ideal hamiltonian @xmath313 will have a good quantum number @xmath284 and additional quantum number(s ) derived from orbital motion .",
    "the eigenstates with opposite @xmath284 have the same energy but different orbital quantum numbers in spin - orbit - coupled tr - invariant tis .",
    "measuring @xmath284 of @xmath312 many times would produce a fractionally quantized average value @xmath314 because @xmath284 is conserved .",
    "analogous quantum measurements of any other spin projection in @xmath312 with fixed orbital quantum numbers would yield non - quantized averages that smoothly depend on the orientation of the spin - projection axis .",

    "the quasiparticle excitations @xmath315 of the ideal hamiltonian @xmath316 behave differently .",
    "there , one must prepare @xmath315 in a momentum @xmath62 eigenstate , and measure the spin projection along the @xmath317 axis in order to observe the fractional quantization of average values .",
    "all other projection axes or orbital states would spoil the observation of spin fractionalization .    a sharp distinction and a phase transition between the minimally different ground states @xmath308 and @xmath309 exists only when the symmetries of both are not jeopardized by the fundamental dynamics ( e.g. when both states arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same su(2 ) symmetric many - body hamiltonian ) .",
    "this is reflected in the nature of their topological symmetry - protected edge modes that we compare in the figure [ rings ] .",
    "an entire class of smooth local perturbations has an effect on the spin density and current flows along edges that is equivalent to their local spin rotations , or an su(2 ) gauge transformation . since no gauge transformation can connect the edge modes and bulks of @xmath308 and @xmath309 , these idealized ground states are different quantum phases .",
    "in fact , there are infinitely many different quantum phases of both kinds , characterized for example by the number of gapless edge modes ( a spin chern number in the uncorrelated lattice case of @xmath308 ) .",
    "the spin - hall conductivity is quantized only when the spin projection ( @xmath284 ) parallel to the external su(2 ) flux ( @xmath318 ) is conserved .",
    "therefore , the ideal @xmath308 is a quantum spin - hall state while @xmath309 is not .",
    "however , the spin projection of a single particle is not conserved in realistic systems at least due to interactions .",
    "the `` dynamical '' spin symmetry of @xmath309 is even more fragile .",
    "it depends on the single - particle momentum conservation , which is jeopardized by interactions , disorder , and even bending of the system s edges .",
    "spin - fractionalization is only approximate in realistic systems .",
    "its manifestations could be visible at such short time or length scales that allow neglecting all scattering events of a single quasiparticle excitation that alter its spin projection .",
    "the ground state incompressibility is helpful in this regard since it endows the low - energy quasiparticles with an infinite lifetime .",
    "apart from these imperfections of realistic systems , the fractionalization of the quasiparticle exchange statistics and the spectrum of symmetry - protected quantum numbers are the same in the two minimally different ground states @xmath306 .",
    "we will also show in the next section that the ground - state degeneracy on a torus is the same in these two laughlin quantum liquids .",
    "therefore , they have the same topological order because they are distinguished only by properties that are not topologically protected .",
    "we have seen that one of such properties is even the quantized spin - hall conductivity of the ideal @xmath308 .",
    "only the u(1 ) symmetry allows its respective hall conductivity to be topologically protected .",
    "any perturbation that removes the defining symmetries of @xmath308 and @xmath309 can open a gap in the edge state spectrum and thus ruin the fragile phase transition between them .",
    "the tr - symmetry alone protects only a z@xmath32 edge - state distinction between topological states with the same topological order @xcite .",
    "the lack of symmetry also spoils the bulk measurements of fractional spin discussed above , but does not jeopardize the topological order expressed via the topologically protected numbers @xmath197 in ( [ densityquant ] ) which determine the details of many - body quantum entanglement .",
    "here we calculate the ground state degeneracy of fractional tis on non - simply connected surfaces .",
    "we will focus on the laughlin sequence of tr - invariant fractional states of spin @xmath54 particles .",
    "our main goal is to establish the existence of spin - related topological orders despite the fact that the rashba spin - orbit coupling of solid - state materials spoils spin conservation .",
    "this is motivated by our interest in topological orders that are created by the rashba spin - orbit coupling , rather than the ones merely perturbed by it .",
    "let us first review the procedure for extracting the topological degeneracy in the well - understood situations when spin and charge are conserved @xcite . consider the tr - invariant su(2 ) hall effect shaped by the external gauge field @xmath290 in ( [ a1a2 ] ) .",
    "the two spin projections are decoupled and experience opposite magnetic fields .",
    "this admits a pure cs gauge theory description of low energy dynamics in quantum hall states .",
    "the tr - invariant laughlin state discussed in the section [ secfract ] is characterized by vortex densities @xmath319 , where @xmath310 for spin @xmath54 particles , and @xmath66 is a positive integer .",
    "we assume that vortex fields @xmath176 are locally coherent in quantum hall states , so their phase gradients @xmath158 are locked to the gauge field @xmath11 that represents the physical particle currents .",
    "we may , therefore , integrate out @xmath11 in ( [ toplg ] ) and use ( [ effth ] ) to arrive at the following effective cs theory : @xmath320 we have defined @xmath321 , and omitted the generated vortex coulomb and current - current interactions .",
    "the latter is justified by our exclusive interest in the ground states and the fact that vortices are always gapped .",
    "recall that the `` gauge fields '' @xmath158 admit only quantized flux loops by the requirement that @xmath285 be single - valued .",
    "this constraint enables a sharp distinction between gauge field configurations that correspond to the ground - state manifold and excitations .",
    "any quantized flux tube is bound to cost a finite amount of energy due to its narrow core .",
    "the exception are flux tubes that reside outside of the space in which the lagrangian density is defined .",
    "if the space is shaped as a torus , a flux tube can be threaded through one of its openings without paying any core energy , as illustrated in the figure [ fluxbend](a ) .",
    "the situation is temporarily complicated by the presence of @xmath322 in ( [ lagden1 ] ) , which is related to the background density of particles . in normal circumstances , this nucleates flux lines that stretch along the path - integral s time direction at an average spatial density determined by @xmath323 .",
    "the presence of a net bulk magnetic flux is reflected by the corresponding circulating currents along the system s boundary .",
    "however , we will consider a torus geometry of space , which has no boundaries .",
    "the torus geometry frustrates the system by allowing only the configurations of temporal flux lines whose net flux is zero .",
    "a finite @xmath323 is , therefore , fairly innocuous on a torus .",
    "it is better to not have any temporal flux lines at all then to compensate every flux line by an anti - line .",
    "the exception are , again , flux tubes threaded through the torus openings .",
    "we conclude that ground - states on a torus are shaped by phase @xmath159 configurations that wind an integer number of times around any torus opening .",
    "if the torus sizes in both @xmath324 and @xmath325 spatial directions are @xmath326 , then the relevant ground - state configurations are : @xmath327 where @xmath328 are the integer winding numbers . since @xmath158",
    ", we also find @xmath329 and @xmath330 indicates that , indeed , no flux penetrates the torus surface . the configurations ( [ gsconf ] ) are , however , not the only relevant ones because they prohibit electric fields ( spatial flux ) on the torus .",
    "if the magnetic flux threaded through a torus opening changes in time , @xmath331 , then electric field loops should appear on the torus surface according to the faraday s law .",
    "this is physically required because a threaded magnetic flux is merely a circulating supercurrent flowing around the torus , so changing it requires an electric field pulse .",
    "the faraday s law is a consequence of flux conservation in the path - integral .",
    "a flux - tube stretching in the time direction is a constant magnetic field , while its bending toward a spatial direction turns it into an electric field flux line that unavoidably coincides with the change of magnetic field .",
    "electric field is actually perpendicular to the spatial flux vector , so the flux - tube bending into various spatial directions generates circulating electric fields around the place where the magnetic field changes .",
    "it is necessary to integrate out short length- and time - scale fluctuations in the path - integral in order to recover the continuum faraday s law from the diffusion of quantized flux loops .",
    "this is visualized in the figure [ fluxbend](b ) .",
    "now we can look for the missing important field configurations in ( [ gsconf ] ) .",
    "if one viewed the ( 2 + 1)d torus space - time as the boundary of a four - dimensional hyperspace , then a quantized magnetic flux tube threaded through a torus opening could bend in the `` fourth dimension '' to accommodate @xmath331 .",
    "this would cost energy whenever the tube touched or punctured the torus , but the cost can be arbitrarily small if the entry and exit points are sufficiently close together .",
    "we may regard such tube intrusions into the torus space - time as instanton configurations of @xmath159 .",
    "they must be included in the low energy dynamics , but there is no need to construct them explicitly",
    ". we may simply coarse - grain the action on the torus by integrating out the short - scale fluctuations , and require that the faraday s law be dynamically obtained from instanton events .",
    "the coarse - graining will allow flux to diffuse on the torus surface , but the threaded magnetic flux through the torus opening remains quantized .",
    "now , note that keeping @xmath332 from ( [ gsconf ] ) while setting @xmath333 to zero would yield the configurations @xmath334 that precisely implement the correct faraday s law .",
    "therefore , these are the full coarse - grained gauge field configurations that adequately represent the dynamics of the ground states .",
    "the coarse - grained lagrangian density has the same form as ( [ lagden1 ] ) , but with a renormalized coupling of the maxwell term ( the cs couplings are topological and never renormalized ) .",
    "if we substitute ( [ faraday ] ) in the coarse - grained lagrangian density , convert it to real time and integrate over the spatial coordinates of the torus , we obtain the lagrangian of the spatially - uniform low - energy modes : @xmath335 note that @xmath323 drops out completely due to the torus geometry , and hence affects only the dynamics of excitations .",
    "the canonical coordinates are @xmath336 , so the corresponding canonical momenta are : @xmath337 and the hamiltonian is : @xmath338 this is equivalent to the quantum mechanics of a single particle with an internal spin - state , in a spin - dependent external magnetic field .",
    "the particle is allowed to move only on a discrete square lattice whose lattice constant is 1 .",
    "the equivalent gauge fields @xmath339 and their magnetic fields @xmath340 are : @xmath341 the amount of flux per plaquette is @xmath342 , so that there are @xmath343 flux quanta per plaquette .",
    "the above hamiltonian , thus , corresponds to a hofstadter problem , whose spectrum is @xmath66-fold degenerate in each spin sector @xcite .",
    "the total ground - state degeneracy is @xmath344 .",
    "we are now ready to analyze the main problem of interest .",
    "consider the gauge field @xmath292 from ( [ a1a2 ] ) , which captures the rashba spin - orbit coupling in solid - state tis . an attempt to derive the cs theory from ( [ effth ] ) ends with the following effective theory : @xmath345 the spin non - conservation should introduce compact components in the maxwell term ( [ maxwell1 ] ) , but we have expanded them to the quadratic order given that the relevant flux densities ( [ faraday ] ) are extremely small in the thermodynamic limit @xmath346 . even though vortex current - current interactions are omitted again ,",
    "this is not a pure gauge theory because @xmath284 is not conserved .",
    "nevertheless , the relevant @xmath159 configurations in the ground - state manifold are still given by ( [ gsconf ] ) and instantons for the same reasons as before .",
    "instantons always introduce flux lines into the torus space - time and hence rotate @xmath159 in a manner that averages @xmath285 to zero over space - time .",
    "we have no means to capture this exactly in the complicated lagrangian density ( [ lagden2 ] ) .",
    "however , we can consider a hypothetical worst - case scenario in which instantons fail to annihilate the @xmath285 factors even after coarse - graining .",
    "if instantons and coarse - graining only produced ( [ faraday ] ) as the relevant gauge field configurations @xmath213 ( which are now liberated from @xmath159 due to flux diffusion ) , then integrating out ( [ lagden2 ] ) over the spatial coordinates on the torus would yield the real - time lagrangian : @xmath347 the factors @xmath348 are averaged to zero unless @xmath349 because of the windings ( [ gsconf ] ) . consequently",
    ", the second part of the lagrangian always vanishes , so this lagrangian is actually identical to ( [ lag1 ] ) and we are tempted to conclude that the ground - state degeneracy on a torus is again @xmath350 .",
    "but , before we make any conclusions we must address the gauge - dependence of ( [ lagden2 ] ) because choosing a gauge different than ( [ gsconf ] ) would invalidate the above averaging of the @xmath348 factors .",
    "since we are not dealing with a true gauge theory , different gauges are really different physical states .",
    "let us recall that spatially varying @xmath159 configurations generally represent vortex currents ( [ currents ] ) in the original theory ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "we focused earlier only on the circulating vortex currents that produce the quantized flux tubes of @xmath213 .",
    "however , any vortex density or current produced by a deviation from ( [ gsconf ] ) implies the presence of vortex excitations .",
    "vortices are fully gapped by the assumption that the ground state is not a mott insulator ( and they are gapped even in mott insulators by the anderson - higgs mechanism according to our simplified model that neglects the physical photon fluctuations ) . therefore",
    ", the `` gauge '' we used in deriving ( [ lag2 ] ) is exactly pertinent to the ground - state manifold and sharply separated from other `` gauge '' choices by an energy gap .",
    "the only important deviations from ( [ gsconf ] ) are instantons , but they are bound to help rather than hinder the averaging of @xmath348 to zero .    we conclude that the ground - state degeneracy of a tr - invariant su(2 ) laughlin state on a torus is always @xmath350 . the specific spin - non - conserving form of the external gauge field @xmath292 only determines the global symmetry of the ground state , and the details of spatial fluctuations in the lagrangian density that are relevant for the excitation spectrum .",
    "we are also assuming that @xmath292 shapes the energy landscape in a way that gives rise to the specific edge states discussed in the previous section .",
    "quasiparticles are fractionalized , but their conserved spin - like quantum number is the spin - projection perpendicular to momentum according to the right - hand rule .    a more general derivation of the topological ground - state degeneracy relies on the `` topological symmetry '' transformations of the effective lagrangian in quantum hall states .",
    "this procedure reveals the degeneracy on riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus @xmath50 . we will not discuss it here because it essentially follows the calculation of the ref.@xcite and arrives at the analogous conclusion that the degeneracy of all tr - invariant laughlin states is @xmath351",
    "one would have to start from the lagrangian ( [ toplgp ] ) , which is dual to ( [ toplg ] ) and describes physical particles directly .",
    "then , one would derive an effective theory of quantum hall states from this lagrangian ( by fixing the particle densities in all spin channels in the topological term ) .",
    "this effective theory is essentially the same as the landau - ginzburg theory with a chern - simons coupling from the ref.@xcite .",
    "the only difference is in the choice of a ( singular ) gauge and an implicit constraint for the flux quantization of the cs gauge field , but this does not affect any symmetries .",
    "therefore , the same symmetry analysis can then be performed to demonstrate topological orders on riemann surfaces .",
    "the ground - state degeneracy is shaped by the low - energy dynamics of particle or vortex fields , and not directly by the specific spin conserving or non - conserving form of the external su(2 ) gauge flux .",
    "this section discusses the duality relationship between the vortex theory ( [ toplg ] ) and the theory that directly describes the dynamics of physical particles ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the particles are bosons and formally derive duality using the xy and cs descriptions of dynamics @xcite , which are not always available as we have seen in the previous sections .",
    "this and the symmetries will guide us in making a conjecture about an approximate duality that holds generally at the level of the spinor lagrangians ( [ toplg ] ) and ( [ toplgp ] ) for any type of particles .",
    "when the phase fluctuations of the spinor @xmath6 components dominate the dynamics , the landau - ginzburg part of ( [ toplg ] ) can be viewed as the continuum limit of the gauged quantum xy model on the square lattice .",
    "its action can be formulated in the discretized imaginary time : @xmath352 the angles @xmath159 are the phases of the complex spinor components @xmath131 in the representation that diagonalizes the gauge field matrix @xmath236 . in this microscopic model , however ,",
    "@xmath159 live on the ( 2 + 1)d space - time lattice sites @xmath353 , and @xmath238 live on the lattice bonds , where @xmath354 labels the three bond orientations and @xmath355 .",
    "the discrete lattice derivative is @xmath356 and the discrete curl @xmath357 is given by the oriented sum of @xmath358 on the bonds @xmath359 of a square plaquette .",
    "the sum of all gauge fields @xmath238 is non - compact as implied by ( [ toplg ] ) , because the physical particles must be able to exist in fully delocalized states such as superfluids @xcite .",
    "certain linear combinations of @xmath238 are allowed to be compact since spin need not be conserved , but we will assume for simplicity that every @xmath238 is individually non - compact in ( [ sxy ] ) .",
    "we will also neglect the electromagnetic field fluctuations to which electrons are coupled ; otherwise , the sum of @xmath238 associated with charge fluctuations would be gapped out by the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the formal duality transformation maps ( [ sxy ] ) into the xy model of particles @xcite whose continuum limit is given by the landau - ginzburg part of ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "the gauged xy model ( [ sxy ] ) represents the dynamics of vortices , while its dual xy model represents the dynamics of particles .",
    "according to duality , the transition from the superfluid state of particles to a mott insulator can be viewed as the condensation of quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "particles are mobile and coherent in the superfluid state , while vortices are gapped and localized into a vortex lattice if their density is finite .",
    "a mott insulator is a dual reflection of the superfluid where particles and vortices exchange their behavior",
    ".    we can qualitatively view incompressible quantum liquids of bosons , including quantum hall states , as `` arrested '' mott transitions in which both particles and vortices are abundant and mobile , yet uncondensed and controlled by the cyclotron scales .",
    "duality allows simultaneous mobility of both particles @xmath144 and vortices @xmath360 only if vortices are `` attached '' to particles and both have incompressible densities .",
    "this prevents a vortex from passing through a particle , and thereby prohibits strong phase fluctuations that would localize the particles ( and vice versa by duality ) .",
    "we must imagine that the superfluid - like correlations are not locally lost in an incompressible quantum liquid , but particles have nevertheless begun localizing with respect to other nearby particles . in the presence of external fluxes , the wavefunction of a localized particle must acquire vorticity , and this constitutes the microscopic mechanism for `` flux attachment '' .",
    "the quantum hall regime is achieved when every particle becomes a microscopic `` cyclotron '' vortex .",
    "the motion of particles is then governed by lorentz and magnus forces , whose effect is captured by the topological ( chern - simons ) terms in the lagrangian .",
    "an example of conditions that could produce an incompressible quantum liquid is found beyond a first - order transition from a vortex lattice superconductor to a correlated insulator .",
    "vortex lattice melting is generally first - order @xcite , but this implies that the superconducting system enters an insulating state while its order parameter magnitude is still finite .",
    "in other words , the superconductor s phase coherence survives at short length - scales given by the separation between vortices in their liquid state .",
    "this is enough to define isolated vortices in the first place and give rise to magnus forces on them , provided that vortices are small and compact as is the case when the number of particles per vortex is small .",
    "we will now include the topological term @xmath17 of ( [ toplg ] ) in the duality analysis , in order to discover its form in the direct theory of physical particles .",
    "unfortunately , the form of @xmath17 is precisely defined only in the continuum limit .",
    "this can be appreciated by considering an equivalent cs coupling @xmath361 , which couples the particle current @xmath362 to the vortex current @xmath363 .",
    "if a cs term were to be defined microscopically , then the particle current would have to live on the bonds of the direct ( physical ) lattice , while the vortex currents would live on the links of the dual lattice .",
    "these two lattices do not coincide , so the lattice cs coupling @xmath364 is ambiguous . instead of trying to deal with this issue",
    ", we will carry out the duality mapping in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , we will give up keeping track of the detailed lattice effects on the particle and vortex dynamics , but they are anyway known from the exact duality mapping in the absence of topological terms .",
    "our interest is mainly to discover the continuum limit of the topological term in the particle theory , and we will obtain the adaptation of the result from the ref.@xcite to the specific features of the present formalism .    our starting point is the effective theory given by ( [ xy ] ) and ( [ effth ] ) .",
    "we require the presence of the u(1)@xmath365 symmetry that decouples different spin channels in the diagonal representation of @xmath26 . in that case",
    ", all xy fields @xmath159 fluctuate independently , and we need to only focus on the dynamics of one of them at a time .",
    "a single copy of the cs term looks like ( [ csth ] ) with the topologically fixed coupling @xmath265 , where the normalization @xmath366 is used for the cs gauge field .",
    "therefore , the effective theory of vortices in a single spin channel @xmath367 takes the form : @xmath368 even though @xmath213 reflects all local fluctuations of @xmath159 , only its singular ( gauge - invariant ) part contributes to the cs coupling .",
    "it is therefore convenient to carry out a singular gauge transformation @xcite and separate two kinds of fluctuations @xmath369 , where @xmath370 are smooth and @xmath371 are singular phase configurations : @xmath372 we have redefined the `` gauge field '' @xmath213 by fixing its gauge . in order for",
    "vortex spinors to be single - valued , @xmath285 must be single - valued and hence the space - time configurations of @xmath213 can allow flux to be concentrated only in quantized loops as if the dynamics of @xmath213 were extremely compact .",
    "monopole configurations of @xmath213 would have been allowed if only they did nt have to be compensated by @xmath238 , which is non - compact .",
    "we can now promote @xmath213 to arbitrary gauge - field configurations and impose the constraint of `` compactness '' via the poisson summation formula , by introducing an integer - valued fluctuating current field @xmath373 in the path - integral @xmath133 : @xmath374 an integer @xmath373 is associated with every lattice bond in the microscopic lattice formulation of the path - integral , but here we must treat @xmath373 as an integer - valued vector function of continuous space - time coordinates .",
    "the transformed lagrangian ( [ l1 ] ) reads : @xmath375 let us decouple the two xy - model - like terms in ( [ l1 ] ) by applying the hubbard - stratonovich transformation in the path - integral : @xmath376 we need to introduce two real - valued hubbard - stratonovich current fields that appear in the transformed lagrangian , @xmath377 for particles and @xmath378 for vortices : @xmath379 then , integrating out @xmath370 and @xmath238 multiplies the measure of the path - integral by the dirac delta functions that implement the following constraints : @xmath380 strictly speaking , only the transverse ( flux - changing ) modes of @xmath238 are physical and fluctuating , but integrating them out imposes the constraint @xmath381 only on the transverse part @xmath382 of the full vortex current @xmath383 .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal currents are defined by restrictions @xmath384 and @xmath385 respectively , so that integrating out @xmath370 quenches the longitudinal current by imposing @xmath386 .",
    "note that @xmath370 does not include the singular configurations that produce a non - zero flux of @xmath158 , but this does not affect its coupling to the longitudinal current .",
    "once the longitudinal current is suppressed , we can identify the total vortex current with its transverse part and solve the resulting constraints ( [ constr ] ) by introducing a scalar and a gauge field : @xmath387 the scalar field @xmath388 is not allowed to have singular configurations because the curl of @xmath377 must be generated entirely by @xmath389 . substituting the above expressions in ( [ l2 ] )",
    "gives : @xmath390 where we have introduced symbols @xmath391 to simplify notation ( note that @xmath392 restricts the allowed values of @xmath323 and @xmath197 ) .",
    "now we are ready to integrate out @xmath213 , the last field that originated in the vortex lagrangian ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "this can be done by completing the square : @xmath393 where @xmath394 integrating out @xmath395 merely multiplies the path - integral by a constant and leaves behind the effective lagrangian of physical particles : @xmath396 expanding the cs coupling for @xmath397 yields : @xmath398 since @xmath399 , the last term in this expression is an integer multiple of @xmath400 for bosonic particles that require @xmath197 to be an even integer .",
    "then , this term does not affect the path - integral and can be ignored ( because @xmath401 ) .",
    "in contrast , fermionic particles have an odd @xmath197 , so for them the last term introduces interference of the z@xmath32 kind in the path - integral . we will not attempt to study this interference here ; that can be done only in the lattice limit , and may prove to be a formidable challenge since duality mappings for fermions are not known .",
    "instead , we will simply focus on bosons and drop the last term in ( [ makecompact ] ) .",
    "the summation over @xmath373 has no quadratic weight any more and thus forces the gauge field @xmath402 to collect flux only into quantized vortex loops according to ( [ poisson ] ) . from this point on",

    ", @xmath15 must exhibit the same kind of symmetry transformations as the su(2 ) `` magnetic '' flux @xmath26 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath15 in the presence of tr - symmetry must have a form such as @xmath429 , which implies a reduction of the full spin su(2 ) symmetry at least down to u(1 ) in the theory ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "condensates of @xmath413 , or insulating phases with independent fluctuations of individual spinor @xmath413 components in some particular representation , are thus consistent with @xmath430 .",
    "on the other hand , su(2 ) symmetric insulators with fixed @xmath431 are consistent only with @xmath432 .",
    "this includes the special case of mott insulators with an integer number of particles in each spin - projection state .",
    "it also includes mott insulators with arbitrary density whose su(2 ) symmetry is restored by fluctuations ( in which case our detailed duality derivation is not applicable ) .",
    "magnus forces on vortices are proportional to particle densities rather than the dual `` flux '' @xmath15 as naively portrayed by ( [ toplg ] ) and ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "this can be revealed by renormalizing the gauge fields @xmath433 that capture ordinary matter fluctuations in the dual theory . using ( [ dualsymb ] ) , the first two terms of ( [ l1 ] ) become : @xmath434 we see that the numbers @xmath197 are vortex charges . in conventional phases",
    "@xmath435 and there is no fractionalization . however , the interplay between various coupling constants in the landau - ginzburg theory ( [ toplgp ] ) can in principle",
    "set such densities and dispersions of particle modes that the charges @xmath197 become non - trivial via ( [ dualsymb ] ) .",
    "this is not a complete picture of how fractionalization arises dynamically , but it is more general than a rigid kinematic cs description of fractionalized states .",
    "we will not make any further attempts to study the dynamical origin of fractionalized states in this paper .",
    "we found in the section [ secfract ] that vortex densities @xmath175 are locked into the values of @xmath197 in quantum hall states , and similar locking between the particle densities @xmath188 and @xmath197 can be extracted using the duality analysis from this section .",
    "namely , @xmath436 are filling factors , so that @xmath437 and @xmath438 according to ( [ dualsymb ] ) in quantum hall liquids .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 is rigidly determined at least in all laughlin quantum hall liquids , irrespective of which fractional charges are selected by dynamics .",
    "the appearance of @xmath439 in the topological term of ( [ toplgp ] ) is not alarming because this relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath26 does not hold in conventional states of matter that always become stable in the @xmath440 limit .",
    "in such conventional states , @xmath15 is determined by the particle density as discussed above .",
    "the theory ( [ toplgp ] ) might apply to a much more general context than the one we derived it in .",
    "for example , we could formulate it for fermionic particles even though duality mapping is then not known .",
    "furthermore , we will see in the sections [ sechier ] and [ secnonabel ] what generalizations are necessary for hierarchical abelian and non - abelian quantum hall states .",
    "we have analyzed simple topological orders of spinful particles using an su(2 ) gauge theory . in several occasions",
    "we first considered laughlin states with conserved spin , and then naively generalized the analysis to the rashba spin - orbit coupling that does not conserve spin .",
    "however , real materials do not feature the su(2 ) gauge structure and contain perturbations that violate all symmetries of the ideal spin - orbit couplings .",
    "we would like to explain here using duality why none of these violations of spin - conservation or the su(2 ) symmetry jeopardize the conclusions so far , or why the spin - related topological orders are stable .",
    "we found in the section [ secfract ] that generic u(1)@xmath18su(2 ) laughlin incompressible quantum liquids feature quasiparticle excitations with fractional quantum numbers given by ( [ quantnum ] ) , regardless of whether the spin - orbit coupling conserves spin or not .",
    "what matters in the derivation of that result are only the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) stated at the beginning of the section [ secfract ] .",
    "specifically , the vortex densities @xmath175 in all spin channels must be effectively frozen .",
    "note that the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) make no reference to the possible conservation of the @xmath284 spin projection .",
    "if @xmath284 fluctuates , then the winding numbers @xmath188 from ( [ fracexc ] ) and ( [ quantnum ] ) fluctuate accordingly in a state where all @xmath175 are fixed .",
    "the crucial point is that the dual - spin of vortices @xmath6 in ( [ toplg ] ) is conserved , even when the spin of particles @xmath413 in ( [ toplgp ] ) is not conserved .",
    "this is what allows the vortex densities @xmath175 in various dual - spin channels to have quantized incompressible values .",
    "the conservation of dual - spin can be made explicit by emphasizing its nature in the context of the particle lagrangian ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "a vortex with a definite dual - spin projection is a topological defect of a particular particle spinor component @xmath441 in which the phase @xmath410 winds by @xmath442integer about the singularity .",
    "the conservation of dual - spin corresponds to the conservation of vorticity in the particle theory ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "if the particle lagrangian is allowed to have only local terms , then only vortex - antivortex pairs and other topologically neutral deformations of the fields in any given spin channel can cost finite action ( energy ) .",
    "furthermore , no local operator written in terms of @xmath443 and @xmath444 can create or annihilate a single vortex , because it would have to qualitatively alter the field configuration arbitrarily far away from the vortex core .",
    "a local theory can allow the non - conservation of vorticity only if it is a gauge theory with deconfined monopoles ( typically a compact gauge theory ) . a gauge field coupled to the matter field",
    "is necessary in order to compensate the macroscopic energy cost of a vortex configuration in the matter field alone .",
    "then , creating or annihilating a vortex at a particular point in space and time requires compensation by a monopole gauge - field configuration . in our case",
    "there are @xmath7 flavors of vortices , and we could introduce that many compact gauge fields @xmath445 in the model ( [ toplgp ] ) to spoil the conservation of vorticity . alternatively , we could make the gauge fields @xmath445 non - compact and combine them in the following kind of the maxwell term : @xmath446 this would prohibit individual monopoles , but allow monopole - antimonopole pairs in arbitrary two spin channels that correspond to dual - spin flips ( at the expense of the su(2 ) symmetry ) .",
    "both scenarios require dynamical gauge fields , which are simply absent from the theory ( [ toplgp ] ) of particles . at best",
    ", the particles may be charged and coupled to the conventional u(1 ) gauge field of electrodynamics ( which has non - compact dynamics ) , but the spin - orbit su(2 ) gauge field is fundamentally static so that spin - flavored vorticity must be conserved .",
    "note that the choice of the spin projection axis is arbitrary in the above argument , so the full su(2 ) dual - spin symmetry can be partially lowered in ( [ toplg ] ) only through the external fluxes @xmath26 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is at the heart of the robustness of topological orders against perturbations such as disorder and spin non - conserving collisions .",
    "perturbations do not introduce dynamical gauge fields .",
    "topological order can be destroyed only via the landau - ginzburg part of the lagrangian by perturbations that can overcome the ti s gap and make a conventional state more energetically favorable .",
    "contrast this to the situation of the dual lagrangian of vortices ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "it does feature a dynamical gauge field @xmath11 , which describes particle fluctuations in all spin states and provides the means to allow the non - conservation of dual vorticity , that is the physical particle spin .",
    "one weighted trace of @xmath11 is related to charge and must be non - compact due to charge conservation , but certain combinations of @xmath11 eigenmodes can be compact and implement spin - changing events via appropriate modifications of ( [ maxwell1 ] ) .",
    "an example of such a maxwell term is : @xmath447 which is written using the continuum notation but ultimately defined on a lattice , using the representation @xmath448 that was introduced in the previous section .",
    "generally , the compact cosine terms have to reflect the specific ways in which the spin is not conserved , and therefore depend on the spin - orbit coupling and various spin non - conserving perturbations .",
    "we have no means to derive by duality the precise form of the maxwell couplings in these general circumstances .",
    "nevertheless , we can understand qualitatively the effect of fluctuations that are made possible by the compact gauge fields in the vortex lagrangian ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "a compact gauge field can admit @xmath449-quantized flux lines of arbitrary length without any energy cost , implying that monopoles ( ends of semi - infinite flux tubes ) are allowed .",
    "the ensuing fluctuations of quantized flux tubes and monopoles lead to the quantization of local density fluctuations in all charge and spin channels that couple to the compact gauge fields ( in the spirit of the dirac s charge quantization by the existence of monopoles ) .",
    "the meaning of density quantization is that an isolated volume of space can contain only integer multiples of charge / spin quanta .",
    "the quanta can be mobile , but the suppression of smooth density fluctuations produces an incompressible ground state .",
    "the specific compact components of the dual maxwell term @xmath12 dictate which particular vortex density fluctuations become quantized in the theory ( [ toplg ] ) . for example , ( [ maxwell2 ] ) would quantize all vortex density fluctuations that carry a definite dual - spin projection on the @xmath133-axis .",
    "a different kind of spin non - conserving dynamics , translated by duality to a different @xmath12 , could quantize other dual - spin projections , possibly dependent on position or momentum .",
    "the landau - ginzburg part of the lagrangian ( [ toplg ] ) has to determine the incompressible vortex densities that shape the topological order while respecting the imposed density quantization rules .",
    "we can not predict the outcome of this without knowing the precise form of @xmath12 , but we can rest assured that only the dual - spin densities of vortices can be affected .",
    "consequently , the quantization ( [ densityquant ] ) of @xmath175 holds against all forms of spin non - conservation at least in the tr - invariant laughlin states , because the resulting average dual - spin density is zero and properly quantized .",
    "however , spin non - conservation affects the quantum numbers of excitations .",
    "the fractional quantum numbers of quasiparticles discussed in the section [ secfract ] can be jeopardized , but fractional vortex excitations ( typically discussed in the fqhs literature and explained in the section [ sechier ] ) are protected by the dual - spin conservation .",
    "this section demonstrates how the theory ( [ toplg ] ) and its dual ( [ toplgp ] ) can describe a broad range of topological insulating states .",
    "we will first develop the formalism for describing hierarchical abelian fqhs and immediately extend it to the general abelian su(2 ) states of fractional tis .",
    "this formalism will also provide a natural description of uncorrelated `` integer '' quantum ( spin ) hall states .",
    "then we will discuss non - abelian states and generalizations to arbitrary symmetry groups and representations .",
    "we will demonstrate how the topological term of ( [ toplgp ] ) can produce non - abelian statistics of excitations depending on the character of low - energy fluctuations , and devote a special attention to new topological orders that could be obtained from the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "many important properties of the ground state are decided by the dynamical ( landau - ginzburg ) part of the lagrangian .",
    "they include particle densities , excitation spectra , vortex winding numbers and the corresponding fractions of elementary charge or spin that are expressed in quantum fluctuations .",
    "a class of ground states in external gauge fields features frustration which is resolved by nucleating vortices and `` binding '' them to particles in an incompressible quantum liquid . instead of trying to microscopically understand this `` binding '' process , we qualitatively capture its most important outcomes via the topological term .",
    "the unique feature of ( [ toplg ] ) is that its topological term is very general and does not by itself specialize to any concrete topological state of matter .",
    "instead , the topological term describes the quantum entanglement due to particle - vortex `` binding '' once the conventional dynamical properties of the ground state are known ( or chosen for classification purposes ) .",
    "the deducible manifestations of the many - body quantum entanglement are the fractional statistics of quasiparticles and the ground - state degeneracy on riemann surfaces such as torus .",
    "therefore , the topological term alone is responsible for describing topological orders , and can be used to classify them .",
    "we will here discuss only topological orders without asking what dynamical conditions are necessary for stabilizing them .",
    "the section [ secfract ] characterizes some entanglement effects in a particular set of incompressible topological states whose vortex densities are given by ( [ densityquant ] ) .",
    "we can now imagine more complicated incompressible states that feature multiple low energy excitations labeled by some `` flavor '' quantum number @xmath450 that corresponds to emergent symmetries .",
    "the appearance of emergent symmetries in the low - energy dynamics is the only kind of ground state reorganization that overcomes the very restrictive condition ( [ densityquant ] ) without leading to a conventional state such as superconductor or mott insulator .",
    "the resulting possible topological states of matter form a hierarchy based on the emergent symmetries , and are generally obtained form ( [ toplg ] ) when the background flux @xmath26 and density @xmath15 matrices do not commute .",
    "more generally , the low - energy dynamics can lead to non - abelian topological orders .",
    "only the topological term in ( [ toplg ] ) can capture them properly , while the landau - ginzburg part written there is specialized for the dynamics that favors abelian statistics .",
    "we will not attempt in this paper to generalize this landau - ginzburg part because its form is known only to the extent allowed by the duality transformation of the physical particle theory ( [ toplgp ] ) , and the duality mapping is currently available only for the cases with abelian statistics . instead",
    ", we will explore the non - abelian topological states starting from the particle lagrangian ( [ toplgp ] ) whose landau - ginzburg part can be readily constructed by understanding the microscopic system of interest .",
    "the goal we pursue in this paper is very modest and limited to the construction of effective theories of a few highly - entangled topological liquids , should they be stable ground states .",
    "many important issues will be left untouched , most notably the characterization of any observable properties .",
    "a systematic study of fractional non - abelian states and their properties is left for future work .",
    "the main message will be that the topological spinor lagrangian provides a formalism of much greater flexibility than the standard cs theory .",
    "its topological term can be reduced to an effective cs form by coarse - graining in an incompressible quantum liquid , but the cs gauge fields may be arbitrary functions of any number of independent parameters that are restricted by the system s fundamental symmetry group and its representation .",
    "these parameters need not be sufficient to generate fully unconstrained fluctuations of the cs gauge fields .",
    "they instead represent the physical low - energy degrees of freedom , while the cs gauge fields are merely the mathematical tool that endows the physical excitations with non - trivial statistics via the topological term .",
    "we will show that such a flexibility is necessary to describe new topological orders that could arise in the rashba spin - orbit - coupled tis .",
    "first , we will consider abelian fractional quantum hall states of electrons in external magnetic fields ( without a spin - orbit coupling ) , and obtain their most general cs descriptions from ( [ toplg ] ) .",
    "the crucial assumption we need to make is that the low energy dynamics exhibits an emergent u(1)@xmath451 symmetry . the number of low energy modes , and the level of the effective cs theory , is equal to the dimension of the u(1)@xmath451 symmetry representation .",
    "we will consider only the minimal @xmath452-dimensional representations ( conserved quantum numbers ) , so the vector @xmath453 in ( [ toplg ] ) will group together @xmath452 vortex flavors .",
    "the corresponding flavors of particle modes are captured by the @xmath452-dimensional gauge field matrix @xmath11 that depends on @xmath452 fluctuating eigenmodes .",
    "these can be either microscopic particles in different internal states or any emergent low - energy modes that carry conventional quantum numbers ( charge , spin , band / orbital index , etc . ) .",
    "the currents @xmath454 of particle modes can be related to vortex currents @xmath455 via a linear transformation : @xmath456 where the coefficients @xmath457 have a dynamical origin in @xmath458 and are related to vortex charges along the lines hinted in the section [ secdual ] .",
    "we will also consider a generic static u(1)@xmath451 gauge field @xmath19 coupled to vortex flavors in the topological term .",
    "this extended gauge field generally depends on the physical u(1 ) gauge field @xmath459 .",
    "all space - time components of @xmath19 commute with one another , but need not commute with @xmath11 , in which case we have a non - trivial linear relationship ( [ c1 ] ) .    by the assumed symmetry , we can choose to work in the representation that simultaneously diagonalizes all components of @xmath19 and @xmath84 .",

    "if the fluctuations of all densities @xmath463 are suppressed , then we can repeat the analysis from the section [ secfract ] and relate the local measurements of microscopic particle quantum numbers ( charges ) to the quantized windings of @xmath464 in the low - energy vortex field configurations . from ( [ c1 ] )",

    "this can be done by coarse - graining .",
    "we will integrate out the short length - scale fluctuations in the path - integral that average out the non - singular fluctuations of @xmath522 and allow the cs flux to diffuse .",

    "but , the gauge field here belongs to a three - dimensional representation and depends on three parameters while being strictly traceless , so it is guarantied to remain non - abelian after coarse - graining .",

    "we would like to remark here that the obtained non - abelian gauge theories have a self - coupling of the dynamical gauge field that differs from the usually discussed @xcite ( tr - violating ) cs form of the yang - mills gauge field : @xmath582 this is gauge - invariant up to the boundary term , and the wess - zumino - witten term @xcite whose gauge - invariance requires the quantization of the constant @xmath470 .",
    "in contrast , the form ( [ nacs ] ) is gauge - invariant because it contains a ( hidden ) background gauge field @xmath423 bundled into @xmath536 .",
    "even though we could set the gauge @xmath583 , the fundamental presence of @xmath423 is very much in the spirit of the duality between ( [ toplg ] ) and ( [ toplgp ] ) .",
    "the formally analogous topological terms of ( [ toplg ] ) and ( [ toplgp ] ) are essential for reproducing the correct drift currents via equations of motion .",
    "the cs coupling ( [ nonabelcs ] ) might require a different kind of a topological term in the spinor lagrangian , possibly tailored to a different kind of physics than discussed in this paper .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath584 in quantum wells does not conserve any fixed spin projection , but respects a special dynamical symmetry that we discussed in the section [ sectopord ] .",
    "if no perturbations or interactions spoil this symmetry , it will define the quantum numbers of excitations .",
    "our goal here is to rudimentarily explore the highly entangled incompressible quantum liquids consistent with this symmetry , and establish that they host quasiparticles with a non - abelian fractional statistics .",
    "the latter indicates a non - trivial topological order , which is automatically robust against sufficiently weak perturbations even if they spoil the symmetries of the ideal rashba - coupled hamiltonian .",
    "let us focus on spin @xmath54 particles .",
    "if @xmath284 were conserved , we would expect the spinor configurations @xmath585 to be relevant at low energies when the density fluctuations are small in comparison to the average densities @xmath586 and @xmath587 .",
    "this applies to quantum hall and spin - hall liquids , and leads to our earlier constructions of the abelian cs theories , albeit in the language of vortices rather than particles .",
    "the @xmath284 conservation here defines the two eigenmodes that carry the opposite @xmath284 spin projections , and the independent fluctuations of these modes at fixed densities are captured by the above spinor configurations .",
    "in contrast , the translation symmetry and the dynamical symmetry of the rashba spin - orbit coupling create particle modes that carry a conserved momentum @xmath62 and a conserved `` helical '' spin projection @xmath588 .",
    "generic excitations are superpositions of these modes that we can describe by the following spinor field configurations : @xmath589 where @xmath590 is the angle of the in - plane direction perpendicular to @xmath62 according to the right - hand rule , and @xmath543 is the vector of pauli matrices .",

    "the real - space field configurations @xmath592 @xmath593[t3 ] are characterized by the densities @xmath594 an incompressible quantum liquid that conserves the helical spin projection will have constant uniform densities @xmath595 in both @xmath591 sectors , so that @xmath596 this represents one constraint on each of the two complex amplitudes @xmath597 per point in space - time .",
    "therefore , the allowed configurations of @xmath598 are determined by one real function @xmath599 in each @xmath591 sector .",
    "the complexity of ( [ t4 ] ) will unfortunately prevent us from identifying the independent variables @xmath599 , but we will still gain some insight about the quantum states shaped by their fluctuations .    the tr - invariance and other symmetries impose no restrictions on the incompressible densities @xmath600 and @xmath601 .",

    "let us consider such a special case , where for example only @xmath602 is important .",
    "having a fixed density @xmath604 in an incompressible quantum liquid allows us to generate the low - energy fluctuations by applying a unitary operator to a fixed spinor : @xmath605 the cs gauge field ( [ csb ] ) is given by @xmath606 as a function of the independently fluctuating variables @xmath607 .",
    "all aspects of topological order in an incompressible quantum liquid are then captured by the effective cs lagrangian ( [ nacs ] ) expressed in terms of this gauge field , and by the knowledge of low - energy particle modes that restrict the gauge field configurations .",
    "the effective theory also contains @xmath608 , but the tr - invariance ensures that it can be replaced by @xmath609 after coarse - graining .",
    "the winding numbers of vortex excitations determine the quantization of @xmath610 that appears in the cs theory , and hence the fractional amounts of charge and spin .",
    "the ensuing topological orders can be classified by a laughlin - like sequence of states and hierarchical constructions . however , the statistics of quasiparticles and the ground state degeneracy on riemann surfaces are expected to differ from the ordinary laughlin and hierarchical quantum hall states .",
    "the statistics of excitations can be found by considering the adiabatic evolution of a quasiparticle s spinor as it moves on a closed path around another quasiparticle .",
    "it depends on the cs gauge field in the vicinity of a vortex , which in the present case gives rise to a non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect and a non - abelian fractional statistics once @xmath610 is fractionally quantized .",
    "unfortunately , we can not reach more detailed conclusions at this time .",
    "the characterization of non - abelian topological orders is an open problem , since the steps outlined here can not be carried out without a better understanding of the non - abelian duality .",
    "nevertheless , we can at least get a glimpse of a @xmath602 vortex and appreciate why the quantum liquids of such vortices produce tr - invariant non - abelian topological orders .",
    "we do not know how @xmath611 in ( [ t5 ] ) depends on @xmath607 , but we can establish that it is locally a linear combination of the unit - matrix , @xmath612 and @xmath613 , which does not include @xmath36 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the pauli matrices are introduced in ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) only via the products @xmath614 with a two - dimensional vector @xmath615 .",
    "any unitary operator of this kind can be written as @xmath616 in our case , @xmath617 , @xmath549 and @xmath550 are mutually - dependent functions derived non - locally from a single independent function @xmath607 . after isolating out the trivial charge fluctuations @xmath618",
    ", the rest of this operator is the same as the one in ( [ psi1 ] ) , so the traceless part of the corresponding cs gauge field @xmath619 takes the form ( [ psi1b ] ) in terms of the vector @xmath620 : @xmath621    an elementary @xmath602 excitation that carries momentum @xmath62 has an amplitude @xmath622 , so its field configuration is : @xmath623 this mode carries both a charge and spin current .",
    "charge currents must be absent in a tr - invariant ground state , so let us consider a superposition of two elementary @xmath602 modes that carry counter - propagating currents : @xmath624 the corresponding cs gauge field @xmath625 is : @xmath626 and it can be reproduced by @xmath627 from the expression ( [ t7 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen either from ( [ pcurrents3 ] ) or ( [ pcurrents4 ] ) that the charge and spin current densities carried by this excitation are : @xmath628 meaning that only the helical spin projection perpendicular to the momentum @xmath615 is carried in the direction of @xmath615 .",
    "the charge and spin densities are : @xmath629 the number ( charge ) density is uniform and thus consistent with incompressibility .",
    "the spin density appears non - uniform , but it should be noted that it oscillates in both space and time .",
    "we have been emphasizing only the spatial dependence , but @xmath630 in fact stands for @xmath631 , where the frequency @xmath632 is by magnitude equal or greater than the excitation gap @xmath633 in the incompressible liquid state .",
    "these oscillations are removed by coarse - graining over time intervals larger than @xmath634 .",
    "the ground state formed by the zero - point quantum fluctuations of many modes such as ( [ t9 ] ) will not have any spin texture or charge currents .",
    "however , as long as we are allowed to superpose only the @xmath602 modes , we can not eliminate the spin currents .",
    "these currents are allowed by the tr symmetry , but must not have an open - ended flow in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , a stable ground state of fluctuating @xmath602 must in fact feature spin current loops .",
    "any static arrangement of such loops is an su(2 ) vortex lattice , which could be stabilized if the particles were bosonic .",
    "the appropriate configurations of @xmath635 in such a vortex lattice would have to involve a vector field @xmath636 that according to ( [ t11 ] ) changes along any vortex - centered loop as @xmath637 , where @xmath615 is locally tangential to the loop and quantized to make @xmath636 single - valued .",
    "this inevitably generates a quantized @xmath638 flux tube at the vortex center via the @xmath639 part of ( [ t7 ] ) .",
    "the presence of an external su(2 ) flux @xmath640 can naturally generate this type of vortex configurations .",
    "a topologically ordered and highly entangled su(2 ) quantum liquid state is obtained upon the quantum melting of this vortex lattice .",
    "this qualitative picture hints that the duality transformation involving non - abelian fields has a lot in common with the abelian case .",
    "however , an elementary vortex can not be captured by a purely abelian @xmath641 configuration according to ( [ t7 ] ) , so it can not have an abelian statistics . as an example , consider a single vortex with concentric circular spin supercurrents .",
    "the spatial gauge field component @xmath642 taken in the direction perpendicular to the local spin - current flow ( @xmath643 ) is locally proportional to @xmath644 because @xmath546 always points in the radial direction .",
    "hence , @xmath642 is a linear combination of only @xmath612 and @xmath613 . on the other hand ,",
    "the component @xmath645 in the direction parallel to the current flow is a linear combination of all @xmath39 in the presence of the current flow curvatures ( @xmath646 is not parallel to @xmath546 for @xmath647 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath642 and @xmath645 do not commute .",
    "one might say that a dynamical su(2 ) gauge field can emit its own `` gauge boson '' quanta and provide a flux - feedback to the externally imposed flux .",
    "the kind of a tr - invariant topological order explored here is different than any one that can be described using the standard cs theories with proper gauge fields .",
    "clearly , the types of many - body entanglement discussed in this section can be extended to higher spin representations , hierarchical states , inhomogeneous quantum fluids , etc .",
    "fluctuations can be generated by virtually any unitary operator that depends on distributed parameters and acts on the @xmath452-component spinors of fixed amplitudes .",
    "each parameter can be distributed over any complete set of generalized coordinates and coupled to any coordinate - dependent generator of transformations .",
    "the lagrangians ( [ toplg ] ) and ( [ toplgp ] ) provide the formalism to describe all of these possibilities for topological states of matter , at least in principle .",
    "in this paper we constructed a topological field theory of particles in two spatial dimensions whose charge and spin couple to the external electromagnetic and spin - orbit fields .",
    "this theory provides a universal description of both conventional and topological phases , being an extension of the landau - ginzburg lagrangian that implements a state - dependent quantization of classical dynamics via a topological term .",
    "the added topological term is innocuous in phases where particles are well localized ( e.g. mott insulators ) or very mobile ( superconductors and fermi liquids ) .",
    "however , quantum insulators in which the external magnetic field or spin - orbit coupling frustrate particle motion are qualitatively affected by the topological term and acquire quasiparticle excitations with fractional quantum numbers and exchange statistics .",
    "these incompressible quantum liquids are generalized quantum hall states with topological order ( many - body quantum entanglement extending over large distances ) .",
    "the topological field theory was written in two mutually dual and physically equivalent forms : ( [ toplgp ] ) describes the physical particles directly , while ( [ toplg ] ) describes vortices , the topological defects of particle field configurations .",
    "the particle lagrangian ( [ toplgp ] ) must transparently capture the known dynamics of particles in external magnetic and spin - orbit fields , but can not alter their exchange statistics in smooth field configurations that dominate the path integral of conventional phases .",
    "therefore , any statistics - altering topological term may couple only to topological defects .",
    "unfortunately , no experimental evidence of vortex dynamics in the materials of interest is available to guide the construction of such topological terms .",
    "instead , we had to resort to the dual theory of vortices ( [ toplg ] ) and construct its topological term first .",
    "topological defects of the dual theory correspond to physical particles whose dynamics is measurable .",
    "we constructed the dual topological term by requiring that the dual action be stationary when its field configurations reproduce the classical equations of motion for constant drift currents of particles in external magnetic and spin - orbit fields .",
    "the appropriate equations of motion were deduced from the generic model hamiltonian of two - dimensional topological insulators that exhibit the quantum spin - hall effect .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit - coupled electrons in realistic quantum wells are modeled by exactly the same type of hamiltonian , with the same symmetries and qualitative structure . therefore , by using symmetries we achieved an indirect experimental justification of the topological field theory .",
    "the full picture of particle dynamics and topological kinematics is obtained only by establishing the field - theoretical duality between the particle ( [ toplgp ] ) and vortex ( [ toplg ] ) lagrangians , which constrains their relative form .",
    "the vortex lagrangian ( [ toplg ] ) is actually a generalization of ( dynamically enhanced ) chern - simons gauge theories . whenever the dynamics of a quantum state can be approximately captured by an xy model derived from ( [ toplg ] ) , its topological properties",
    "are similarly captured by an effective theory derived from ( [ toplg ] ) that has a chern - simons structure .",
    "a landau - ginzburg theory is already an abstraction that gives up the `` irrelevant '' microscopic details of the system in order to focus on its universal properties based on symmetries .",
    "the true usefulness of a chern - simons theory is achieved when even the symmetries are regarded as `` irrelevant '' in order to focus on topological orders .",
    "a chern - simons theory can be written only after assuming some symmetry , such as u(1)@xmath451 , but the topological order that it captures is robust even when perturbations remove this symmetry .",
    "the topological term of the lagrangian ( [ toplg ] ) is more versatile . it does not assume any emergent symmetry , but rather lets the landau - ginzburg part determine the symmetries and densities in the ground state , which in turn dictate the fractional statistics of quasiparticle excitations",
    "this paper accomplished several goals .",
    "first , we explained the construction of the new topological field theory and its dual .",
    "several known results from the literature were re - derived and adapted to the specific features of the present theory in order to show that it is consistent with the dynamics of systems we wish to model , and that it adequately generalizes the chern - simons theory in the cases of standard u(1 ) quantum hall liquids .",
    "second , we introduced a formalism based on the su(2 ) gauge symmetry that can describe any spin - orbit coupling and view it as the origin of a generalized quantum hall effect .",
    "the su(2 ) `` hall effect '' has a richer phenomenology that its u(1 ) counterpart and need not lead to the quantization of spin - hall conductivity . in particular , we showed that the rashba spin - orbit coupling has a dynamical symmetry that differs from the conventional u(1 ) symmetry of the standard quantum hall effect , but nevertheless creates fractional ground states with topological degeneracy on a torus when interactions stabilize an incompressible quantum liquid .",
    "the simplest such topological orders are of the laughlin kind and do not depend on whether @xmath284 is conserved or not .",
    "we further analyzed the quantum numbers of quasiparticle excitations , and identified the nature of charge and spin fractionalization in relation to the symmetries of the ground state .",
    "we did this for any combination of external magnetic and spin - orbit fields acting on particles with arbitrary spin .",
    "third , we demonstrated the ability of the proposed topological field theory to handle a broad spectrum of incompressible quantum liquids with distinct robust topological orders .",
    "we elucidated the construction of hierarchical incompressible liquids , mostly by focusing on the abelian quantum hall states classified by the u(1 ) chern - simons theories .",
    "the analogous su(2 ) descriptions of hierarchical abelian spin - hall states were obtained in a straight - forward fashion .",
    "then , we considered a few examples of low - energy fluctuations that produce non - abelian fractional statistics in incompressible quantum liquids .",
    "for instance , if such a quantum liquid features a triplet of low - energy modes with su(2 ) symmetry , its topological order is described by an effective su(2 ) chern - simons gauge theory that can be derived from the topological term of ( [ toplg ] ) . in general , the effective theory superficially has a chern - simons form , but its non - abelian gauge fields can be constrained to a subspace of all possible configurations through their dependence on a small number of parameters that generate the low - energy fluctuations .",
    "we specifically constructed an effective field theory of a highly entangled non - abelian incompressible quantum liquid that respects the time - reversal symmetry and takes advantage of the rashba spin - orbit coupling to lower its energy .",
    "the proposed topological field theory is much more general than the chern - simons theory , and its clean structure based on representations and symmetries might provide a broad classification scheme of topological orders .",
    "the present lagrangian can be extended to any representation of arbitrary emergent u(1)@xmath648su(2)@xmath649su(3)@xmath650 symmetry groups in which particles or vortices are coupled to an external ( non - abelian ) `` electromagnetic '' flux of arbitrary direction in the space spanned by the symmetry generators .",
    "the symmetry determines the character of topological orders , the representation is related to the available low - energy particle / vortex modes and the ( non)conservation of their quantum numbers , while the flux direction determines the mutual statistics of modes .",
    "there are many possibilities that will be explored in future work , together with a systematic analysis of observable phenomena such as the properties of protected boundary states .",
    "certain symmetry - protected aspects of topological order can be observed in curved geometries because the total angular momentum of quasiparticles couples to the curvature of their two - dimensional plane @xcite .",
    "similar `` geometric '' coupling , but of dynamical origin , was noticed in anisotropic fractional quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "we restricted the analysis in this paper to the simplest continuum systems , and hence did not consider these geometric properties of incompressible quantum liquids .",
    "nevertheless , the spin - geometry coupling can be readily implemented in the presented theory , and will be scrutinized in the future .    the topological term constructed in this paper",
    "could be viewed as the lowest - order member of a sequence of topological terms that contain higher powers of flux , ( co - variant ) derivatives and field operators .",
    "this sequence must be restricted by symmetries and its higher order members might lead to additional topological orders if they are macroscopically relevant .",
    "further generalizations to higher spatial dimensions and other types of matter fields would involve constructing topological terms that reflect all possible topological defects and their symmetry - allowed couplings to external gauge fields .",
    "finally , the proposed theory also describes the dynamics of particles or vortices via its landau - ginzburg part .",
    "we demonstrated that the topological term is state - independent , but the topological order that it creates depends on the dynamically stable density of particles and vortices . with this level of description",
    ", we can ask whether the written theory could be used to chart universal phase diagrams that contain both conventional and topological states of matter .",
    "this question is very much worth exploring because no method is currently available to solve such problems , other than the numerical exact diagonalization of systems with a few particles .",

    "<S> electrons subjected to a strong spin - orbit coupling in two spatial dimensions could form fractional incompressible quantum liquids without violating the time - reversal symmetry . here </S>",
    "<S> we construct a lagrangian description of such fractional topological insulators by combining the available experimental information on potential host materials and the fundamental principles of quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this lagrangian is a landau - ginzburg theory of spinor fields , enhanced by a topological term that implements a state - dependent fractional statistics of excitations whenever both particles and vortices are incompressible . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling is captured by an external static su(2 ) gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of spin conservation or emergent u(1 ) symmetries would reduce the topological term to the chern - simons effective theory tailored to the ensuing quantum hall state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rashba spin - orbit coupling in solid - state materials does not conserve spin . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that it can nevertheless produce incompressible quantum liquids with topological order but without a quantized hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two examples of such liquids whose description requires a generalization of the chern - simons theory . </S>",
    "<S> one is an abelian laughlin - like state , while the other has a new kind of non - abelian many - body entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> their quasiparticles exhibit fractional spin - dependent exchange statistics , and have fractional quantum numbers derived from the electron s charge and spin according to their transformations under time - reversal . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to conventional phases of matter , the proposed topological lagrangian can capture a broad class of hierarchical abelian and non - abelian topological states , involving particles with arbitrary spin or general emergent su(n ) charges . </S>"
