    "in recent years quantum information theory has known an enormous expansion .",
    "this has boosted new interest in probabilistic and geometric aspects of state spaces of simple quantum systems . in this context , the dynamics of entanglement in a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators has been the subject of many papers  @xcite .",
    "one of the systems for which entanglement dynamics is being studied consists of a large chain of harmonic oscillators coupled by some nearest neighbour interaction  @xcite . in a popular model this coupling",
    "is represented by springs obeying hooke s law .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath3 in other words , the quantum system consists of a string or chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators , each having the same mass @xmath4 and natural frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the position and momentum operator for the @xmath5th oscillator are given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; more precisely @xmath6 measures the displacement of the @xmath5th mass point with respect to its equilibrium position ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the last term in  ( [ intro - h ] ) represents the nearest neighbour coupling by means of `` springs '' , with a coupling strength  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "finally , we shall assume periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath10 such quantum systems are also relevant in quantum optics ( photonic crystals ) , or for describing phonons in a crystal  @xcite .",
    "masses in equilibrium position , ( b ) certain displacements @xmath11 for each oscillator . ]    in the standard approach for the quantum system governed by  ( [ intro - h ] ) , one assumes the canonical commutation relations ( ccr s ) @xmath12=0 , \\qquad [ { \\hat p}_k,{\\hat p}_l]=0,\\qquad [ { \\hat q}_k,{\\hat p}_l]=i\\hbar\\delta_{kl}.      \\label{ccr}\\ ] ] then , reformulating the problem in normal coordinates , the eigenstates of @xmath13 can be described in some infinite - dimensional fock space  @xcite .",
    "the approach of the present paper is more general . instead of postulating the ccr s",
    ", we shall start from a more general quantization procedure .",
    "this procedure is based upon the compatibility of hamilton s equations with the heisenberg equations .",
    "such systems are called wigner quantum systems ( wqs s )  @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on wigner s observation  for the simple example of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator  that this quantum system also allows solutions for which both hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations are satisfied , but not the ccr s  @xcite . in other words , the ccr s are sufficient but not necessary conditions for hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations to be compatible .",
    "wigner s work led to the theory of parabosons and parafermions in quantum field theory  @xcite , and because of this attention its impact for ordinary quantum systems was somewhat overlooked .",
    "another reason why wqs s did not receive immediate attention was because no general solutions could be constructed for the compatibility conditions of simple wqs s ( apart from the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "it was only much later ",
    "after the theory of lie superalgebra s was completed  that palev  @xcite observed that classes of wqs - solutions for the @xmath14-dimensional harmonic oscillator are described by means of representations of the lie superalgebras @xmath15 and @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "this algebraic or representation theoretic approach to quantum systems has revived the interest in wqs s",
    "the wqs approach has so far been applied to simple systems of free harmonic oscillators , with some interesting and surprising results  @xcite . here",
    "it is , for the first time , applied to a more realistic quantum system .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the system described by  ( [ intro - h ] ) as a wqs .",
    "this implies that , apart from the standard solutions for which the ccr s hold , we shall also discover non - canonical solutions .",
    "in particular , we shall show that the quantum system allows solutions in a finite - dimensional hilbert space , thus with a discrete spectrum not only for @xmath13 but also for the position and momentum operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the class of solutions considered here is related to a @xmath2 solution of the quantization or compatibility conditions , and we consider then a simple class of @xmath2 representations in which the physical properties of the quantum system are analysed .",
    "in section  [ sec : q ] we analyse the compatibility conditions for the system  ( [ intro - h ] ) as a wqs .",
    "this leads to an expression of the hamiltonian @xmath13 in terms of a set of @xmath18 operators @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , which are themselves certain lineair combinations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these operators @xmath19 should satisfy certain triple relations , see  ( [ algrelations ] ) .",
    "the task is then to construct operator solutions ( constructions for the @xmath19 as operators acting in some hilbert space ) satisfying these triple relations .",
    "although a complete set of solutions can not be given , we show in section  [ sec : alg ] that certain generators of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 satisfy the triple relations .",
    "in other words , we present algebraic solutions of the compatibility condition ( or quantization condition ) in terms of a lie superalgebra . in order to have algebraic solutions that also satisfy the required unitarity conditions , the coupling constant @xmath8",
    "is bounded by a critical value @xmath21 , depending upon  @xmath0 . since the problem has a @xmath2 solution , the unitary representations of @xmath2 serve as hilbert space representations for the operators of the quantum system . in principle , all unitary representations of @xmath2 are allowed for this purpose . in this paper , however , we shall concentrate on a particular class of unitary representations @xmath22 , mainly for computational purposes .",
    "for these representations @xmath22 , the actions of the @xmath2 generators , and in particular of the operators @xmath19 , are very simple expressions , see section  [ sec : repres ] . on the other hand , the class of representations @xmath22 is already sufficiently rich to exhibit intriguing physical properties of the quantum system under consideration .",
    "these properties are examined in the remaining sections . in section  [ sec : h ] we study the energy spectrum of the quantum system in @xmath22 . if @xmath23 ( absence of coupling ) , the system consist of @xmath0 independent ( or free ) identical one - dimensional oscillators , and it is easy to see that there are @xmath24 equidistant energy levels in @xmath22 , with multiplicities @xmath25 according to the level  @xmath5 ( @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , these energy levels split : we can give a closed formula for the energy levels themselves , for their multiplicities , and for the total number of energy levels ( which grows like @xmath28 ) .",
    "section  [ sec : position ] is devoted to the investigation of spatial properties of the chain of coupled oscillators , if the system is in one of the representations @xmath22 .",
    "clearly , since the representations considered here are finite - dimensional , the spectrum of position operators @xmath6 and momentum operators @xmath7 is discrete . we manage to give the spectrum of these operators in closed form , but so far an analytic expression for a set of orthonormal eigenvectors is missing",
    "finally , we examine numerically for a simple example ( @xmath29 ) some position probability distributions of the oscillator system .",
    "the case of _ atypical _ representations @xmath22 ( i.e.  @xmath30 ) is examined in section  7 , followed by some concluding remarks in section  8 .",
    "in our approach we shall require that hamilton s equations @xmath31 and the heisenberg equations @xmath32 , \\quad       { \\dot{\\hat{q}}}_k = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{h},\\hat{q}_k ]   \\qquad ( k=1,2,\\ldots , m )       \\label{heis}\\ ] ] should be identical as operator equations . since hamilton s equations for the hamiltonian  ( [ intro - h ] ) take the explicit form @xmath33 the compatibility conditions read @xmath34 & = -\\frac{i\\hbar } { m } \\hat{p}_k , \\label{ccpq1}\\\\ { }     [ \\hat{h},\\hat{p}_k ] & = -i\\hbar cm\\,{\\hat q}_{k-1}+i\\hbar m(\\omega^2 + 2c)\\,{\\hat q}_k - i\\hbar cm \\,{\\hat q}_{k+1 } , \\label{ccpq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , and  extending  ( [ qm+1 ] )",
    " @xmath36 stands for @xmath37 , or more generally @xmath38 whenever @xmath5 is out of the range @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , the task is to find operator solutions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that the compatibility conditions  ( [ ccpq1])-([ccpq2 ] ) , together with  ( [ intro - h ] ) , are satisfied .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to physical observables , the operators should be unitary : @xmath40    just as in the canonical treatment of the problem  @xcite , it will be useful to introduce `` normal coordinates '' and reformulate the problem in terms of these new coordinates .",
    "so let us consider the finite fourier transforms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath41 the inverse relations are given by : @xmath42 as for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , see  ( [ modulo - qp ] ) , it will sometimes be useful to extend the indices by @xmath43 note that the unitarity conditions  ( [ unitaryqp ] ) imply : @xmath44 and in particular , following the convention  ( [ modulo - qp ] ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "an essential part is now to substitute  ( [ qk])-([pk ] ) in the hamiltonian @xmath13 , given by  ( [ intro - h ] ) , and simplify this expression without assuming any commutation relations between the operators . for the term @xmath47 , one can , after the substitution , use the identity @xmath48 and thus @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , @xmath50 .",
    "the coupling terms can be written as @xmath51 in the right hand side , the first two sums are of the same form as before ; the last sum yields @xmath52 thus we obtain , just as in the canonical case  @xcite @xmath53 where , for @xmath54 , the quantities @xmath55 are positive numbers with @xmath56 and clearly @xmath57 substituting  ( [ qk])-([pk ] ) in  ( [ ccpq1])-([ccpq2 ] ) yields the set of compatibility conditions for the new operators : @xmath58&=-\\frac{i\\hbar } { m } \\hat{p}_r^\\dagger , \\quad     [ \\hat{h},\\hat{q}_r^\\dagger ] = -\\frac{i\\hbar } { m } \\hat{p}_r , \\label{ccpq1 } \\\\ { }   [ \\hat{h},\\hat{p}_r ] & = i\\hbar m\\omega_r^2\\hat{q}_r^\\dagger , \\quad   [ \\hat{h},\\hat{p}_r^\\dagger ] = i\\hbar m\\omega_r^2\\hat{q}_r . \\label{ccpq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the task is now reduced to finding operator solutions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that the compatibility conditions  ( [ ccpq1])-([ccpq2 ] ) , together with  ( [ hpq ] ) , are satisfied .    as a final step it is convenient to introduce linear combinations of the unknown operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , say @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath54 ) , by @xmath63 with @xmath64 observe that the inverse relations take the form @xmath65 with similar expressions for @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". in terms of the new set of unknown operators @xmath19 ( @xmath54 ) , the hamiltonian  ( [ hpq ] ) becomes : @xmath68 it is essential  and the reader should verify this  that in going from  ( [ hpq ] ) to  ( [ haa ] ) , no commutation relations among the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 are used , but only identities like  ( [ modulo - qp ] ) , ( [ unitaryqp ] ) and  ( [ symm - omega ] ) . a final and simple calculation , using  ( [ a- ] ) and  ( [ a+ ] ) , shows that  ( [ ccpq1])-([ccpq2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath69=\\pm \\hbar \\omega_r a_r^\\pm , \\quad \\ ( r=1,2\\ldots , m ) .   \\label{cca}\\ ] ] thus    in the approach of  ( [ intro - h ] ) as a wigner quantum system , the problem is reduced to finding @xmath18 operators @xmath19 ( @xmath70 , acting in some hilbert space , such that @xmath71 and @xmath72= \\pm 2 \\omega_r a_r^\\pm , \\quad \\ ( r=1,2\\ldots , m ) .",
    "\\label{algrelations}\\ ] ] the operators corresponding to physical observables @xmath6 and @xmath7 are then known linear combinations of @xmath19 , and the hamiltonian @xmath13 is given by  ( [ haa ] ) .    as we shall see in the following section , this is an algebraic problem that has a class of solutions in terms of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 .    before concentrating on an algebraic solution ,",
    "let us end this section with a few words about the time dependency of the operators .",
    "the time dependency of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is determined by  ( [ qdot])-([pdot ] ) . from these equations and  ( [ qr])-([pr ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath73 using ( [ a-])-([a+ ] ) yields @xmath74 with the evident solution @xmath75 so it is sufficient to have solutions for the operators @xmath19 at time 0 , @xmath76 .",
    "the time dependence for @xmath77 is given by  ( [ a(t ) ] ) , and since all operators of the quantum system can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 , their time dependence follows . as a consequence , we shall concentrate on solutions of the system  ( [ haa])-([cca ] ) at time @xmath78 .    for completeness",
    ", it should also be mentioned that if the ccr s  ( [ ccr ] ) hold , then the operators @xmath19 satisfy the usual boson relations @xmath79=0 $ ] , @xmath80=\\delta_{rs}$ ] . in that case  ( [ cca ] ) follows automatically from  ( [ haa ] ) .",
    "the set of relations  ( [ algrelations ] ) , together with the conditions  ( [ unitarya ] ) , are reminiscent of the algebraic relations satisfied by a set of @xmath2 generators  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that our problem has indeed a solution in terms of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 or @xmath81 .",
    "let us first recall the definition of @xmath2 : it is a lie superalgebra with basis elements @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . the elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) are _ odd _ elements , having degree @xmath87 ; the remaining basis elements are _ even _ elements , having degree  0 .",
    "the lie superalgebra bracket is determined by  @xcite @xmath88 in a representation , or in the enveloping algebra of @xmath2 , the bracket @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are homogeneous elements of @xmath2 ) stands for an anti - commutator if @xmath90 and @xmath91 are both odd elements , and for a commutator otherwise .",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath81 is the subalgebra of @xmath2 consisting of elements with supertrace  0 , or also @xmath92 .    for a lie superalgebra",
    "one can also fix a star condition , i.e.  an anti - linear anti - involution . for @xmath2 or @xmath81 such a star condition is fixed by a signature @xmath93 , i.e.a sequence of plus or minus signs @xmath94 and @xmath95 thus with each @xmath96 equal to @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case where all @xmath96 s are @xmath97 since this corresponds to the `` compact form '' @xmath99 of @xmath2  @xcite , for which finite - dimensional unitary representations exist  @xcite .",
    "we shall now show that there exist solutions of the form @xmath100 with @xmath101 certain complex constants to be determined .",
    "first of all , note that by  ( [ starcondition ] ) , the unitarity condition  ( [ unitarya ] ) is automatically satisfied . with  ( [ a = e ] ) , the hamiltonian  ( [ haa ] ) becomes @xmath102 and the commutator of the above with  ( [ a = e ] ) yields : @xmath103 = \\pm \\hbar \\bigl(\\sum_{j=1}^m \\sigma_j |\\alpha_j|^2 - \\sigma_k |\\alpha_k|^2\\bigr ) a_k^\\pm \\qquad ( k=1,\\ldots , m).\\ ] ] these should coincide with the compatibility conditions  ( [ cca ] ) .",
    "thus we get a system of @xmath0 equations in the unknown coefficients @xmath101 : @xmath104 it is easy to verify that a solution for this set of equations is determined by @xmath105 for further use , it will be convenient to introduce the following numbers : @xmath106 with @xmath107 the values fixed by  ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath108 and thus @xmath13 can be rewritten as @xmath109    remember that we are primarily interested in the signature with all @xmath96 s equal to @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath110 , the question is whether there exist solutions such that all @xmath111 s are positive . at first sight , ( [ beta ] )",
    "indicates that @xmath111 is equal to @xmath112 plus `` some average value '' of the @xmath107 s , and hence one would expect half of the @xmath111 s to be negative and half of them to be positive .",
    "we shall show , however , that under certain conditions ( `` weak coupling '' , i.e.  a small value for @xmath8 ) , all @xmath111 s are indeed positive .",
    "first of all , note that for @xmath9 , @xmath113 since a similar property holds for the values @xmath114 .",
    "thus if @xmath115 , then all @xmath111 s are positive .",
    "the value of @xmath116 depends on the value of @xmath8 ; if @xmath23 then indeed all @xmath117 are positive .",
    "so by continuity as a function of  @xmath8 there will be a certain interval @xmath1180,c_0[$ ] where all @xmath111 s are positive .",
    "this critical value @xmath21 is the @xmath8-value for which @xmath119 . for general @xmath0 , this is a complicated transcendental equation that can be solved only numerically .",
    "table  1 gives the numerical solutions for this equation , for @xmath0 ranging from 4 to 21 ( for @xmath120 or @xmath121 the @xmath111 s are always positive ) .",
    ".critical values @xmath122 [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the extreme position of oscillator  1 has a strong influence on the possible positions of oscillator  2 , a weaker influence on the possible positions of oscillator  3 , and again a stronger one on those of oscillator  4 ( this last is due to the periodic boundary conditions  ( [ qm+1 ] ) , oscillator  4 behaves as if it is just to the left of oscillator  1 ) .",
    "we have also considered a second example , when the first oscillator is in an eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath123 , i.e.  the system is in a state @xmath124 .",
    "the position probability distributions for the other oscillators @xmath125 are plotted in figure  4(b ) , where we have averaged out over @xmath126 ( here , @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus in figure  4(b ) an answer is given to the following question : suppose we make a measurement of the position of the first oscillator , and detect it in @xmath123 , what are in that case the probabilities of finding the other oscillators 2 , 3 , and 4 in one of their positions @xmath128 ?",
    "in this section , we very briefly discuss what happens when working with atypical representations @xmath22 , i.e.  when @xmath129 .",
    "we concentrate on the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath13 and on that of the operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 . recall that the representation space in the atypical case is a truncation of that in the typical case , discarding basis vectors @xmath132 for which @xmath133 .",
    "thus one expects a close connection between the spectra of the different operators in the typical and atypical case .",
    "it is clear that each basis vector @xmath132 is still an eigenvector of @xmath13 , with eigenvalue @xmath134 , with @xmath135 given by  .",
    "so the spectrum of @xmath13 in the atypical case is nothing but a truncation of that in the typical case where the higher eigenvalues are retained ( of course , the actual values are different because of the different value for @xmath136 ) . as an example , for @xmath29 and @xmath137 the dimension of the representation space is @xmath138 and the only four eigenvalues @xmath134 of @xmath13 are @xmath139 where @xmath140 for @xmath27 .",
    "these are the four topmost energy levels depicted in figure  2(a ) .    in the typical case",
    "@xmath130 has eigenvalues @xmath141 , with @xmath142 . from equations  , , and   it follows immediately that an eigenvector of @xmath130 in the typical case is also an eigenvector of @xmath130 in the atypical case provided that it is a linear combination of basis vectors @xmath132 with @xmath143 .",
    "when @xmath144 one has the same set of eigenvectors as in the typical case , arising from both @xmath145 and @xmath146 and the multiplicity of @xmath147 is @xmath148 .",
    "however , when @xmath149 , @xmath150 and only the vectors arising from @xmath146 remain ( the vectors arising from @xmath145 would have @xmath151 which is impossible in an atypical representation ) .",
    "the multiplicity of eigenvalue @xmath150 is thus @xmath152 .",
    "consider the case @xmath29 and @xmath137 ; each operator @xmath130 has two eigenvalues namely @xmath153 , with multiplicity @xmath154 and @xmath155 with multiplicity @xmath156 .    for the position operators @xmath131 finally , it is seen as before that @xmath128 with @xmath157 are eigenvalues of @xmath131 each with multiplicity @xmath158 .",
    "besides these eigenvalues , there is also the eigenvalue @xmath150 with multiplicity @xmath152 .",
    "so in the atypical case it is possible to detect  an oscillator in its equilibrium position , in contrast with the typical case .",
    "it is worth giving some further details for the representation @xmath159 ( so @xmath137 ) , for general @xmath0-values .",
    "this representation has dimension @xmath24 , with basis vectors @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( in the notation of  ( [ v_r ] ) ) , with @xmath162 .",
    "each position operator @xmath163 has spectrum @xmath164 , with multiplicities @xmath165 respectively , where @xmath166 .",
    "herein , @xmath167 is given by  ( [ gamma ] ) ; in fact it will be useful to introduce the notation @xmath168 and thus @xmath169 .    in this case",
    ", it is not difficult to construct explicitly a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath163 . in the notation of subsection  6.3",
    ", it is given by : @xmath170 where @xmath171 .",
    "now it becomes simple to compute some position probabilities .",
    "following  ( [ probp ] ) , one finds for the state @xmath160 with @xmath172 : @xmath173 hence in the highest energy state of @xmath159 , the oscillators can be detected only in the positions @xmath174 and not in  0 .",
    "similarly : @xmath175    also the probabilities  ( [ proba ] ) can be computed .",
    "one finds , for example : @xmath176 and thus @xmath177 as before , the quantities @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 describe the probabilities of detecting the @xmath181th oscillator in the position @xmath182 , @xmath153 or @xmath183 respectively , when the first oscillator is in its highest position  @xmath182 .    with the given probabilities , one can consider a final illustration .",
    "if the system is in the state @xmath184 , the average position of each oscillator  @xmath181 is given by @xmath185 using  ( [ cossin ] ) , this simplifies to @xmath186 in figure  5 we plot the average position of each oscillator  @xmath181 in this state .",
    "so in this figure one can see the effect of having the first oscillator in its highest position @xmath182 on the average position of the other oscillators .",
    "oscillators , @xmath187 , when the first oscillator is in the position @xmath182 , in the representation @xmath159 .",
    "here , we have taken @xmath188 .",
    "the horizontal axis labels the @xmath0 oscillators ; the vertical axis gives the average position in units of @xmath189 . ]",
    "we have examined some properties of non - canonical solutions of the quantum system determined by the hamiltonian  ( [ intro - h ] ) .",
    "these solutions arise from a wigner quantum systems approach , where the quantization conditions are weaker than the canonical commutation relations , thus allowing more types of solutions .",
    "the solutions studied here are found by identifying certain linear combinations of position and momentum operators with generators of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that this is always possible , but that the solutions are corresponding to the compact form @xmath99 of @xmath2 only if the coupling constant @xmath8 is sufficiently small .    the physical hilbert spaces in which the states of the system are described then correspond to unitary representations of @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we have considered only a simple class of such unitary representations , the so - called fock spaces @xmath22 .",
    "this class of representations turns out to be already sufficiently resourceful in order to exhibit some fascinating physical properties of the solutions .",
    "of special interest is the feature of having only a discrete spectrum for each oscillator position operator . at first sight , this is somewhat unusual . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis of probability distributions for position operators has shown effects that are reminiscent of canonical results .",
    "this paper presents only the first results for this quantum system consisting of a one - dimensional chain of coupled harmonic oscillators in the wigner quantum systems approach .",
    "there are still many open problems or new aspects to be studied .",
    "for example , it is clear that the system  ( [ algrelations ] ) has also solutions outside @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath190 is even , then one can construct an algebraic solution by means of the direct sum lie superalgebra @xmath191 ( @xmath14 copies ) . in this case",
    ", the unitarity conditions following from the form @xmath192 imply no conditions on the coupling constant @xmath8 , and it would be interesting to study the system from this point of view .",
    "furthermore , it would be worth investigating whether  ( [ algrelations ] ) has also solutions related to orthosymplectic lie superalgebras  @xcite .",
    "but even if we restrict for the moment our attention to the @xmath2 solutions given here in section  [ sec : alg ] , work remains to be done .",
    "in particular , one should also consider other classes of unitary @xmath2 representations  @xcite and investigate the corresponding physical properties .",
    "finally , and this a more technical question , the explicit construction of orthonormal eigenvectors of the position operators @xmath6 is lacking . although this can be done numerically for any given @xmath0 and a given set of parameters , we have at the moment no closed form expressions for these eigenvectors .",
    "we hope to find such forms , as they would allow us to draw some general conclusions regarding position probability distributions . at this moment",
    ", the last conclusions in section  6 are based upon observations of examples rather than upon analytic formulas .",
    "we expect to return to some of these remaining questions in future publications .",

    "<S> we consider a quantum system consisting of a one - dimensional chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators with natural frequency  @xmath1 , coupled by means of springs . </S>",
    "<S> such systems have been studied before , and appear in various models . in this paper , we approach the system as a wigner quantum system , not imposing the canonical commutation relations , but using instead weaker relations following from the compatibility of hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations . in such a setting , the quantum system allows solutions in a finite - dimensional hilbert space , with a discrete spectrum for all physical operators . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a class of solutions can be obtained using generators of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . then we study the properties and spectra of the physical operators in a class of unitary representations of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are both interesting and intriguing . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we can give a complete analysis of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and of the position and momentum operators ( including multiplicities ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also study probability distributions of position operators when the quantum system is in a stationary state , and the effect of the position of one oscillator on the positions of the remaining oscillators in the chain .    * </S>",
