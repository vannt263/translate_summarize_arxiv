    "in this paper we want to introduce the strength of higher - order spin orbit resonances which we want to use in the froissart - stora formula to compute how much polarization is lost when a resonance is crossed . for first - order resonances the",
    "definition and computation of the resonance strength is relatively simple @xcite , for higher - order resonances it is much more elaborate .",
    "we will need to use the invariant spin field , also called the @xmath1-axis @xcite , the amplitude dependent spin tune and the periodic coordinate system over phase space that determines the spin tune @xcite .",
    "these concepts are therefore quickly reviewed in this introduction .",
    "while a polarized particle moves along the azimuth @xmath2 of the storage ring s closed orbit with path length @xmath3 and total length @xmath4 , its semi - classical spin precesses according to the t - bmt equation @xcite @xmath5 the spin direction that is periodic after one turn is referred to as @xmath6 . if the spin has any other direction , it precesses around @xmath7 .",
    "the numbers of precessions that occur during one turn is referred to as the closed orbit spin tune @xmath8 . to describe the precession ,",
    "a right handed system of orthogonal unit vectors @xmath9 is introduced for any azimuth .",
    "the two vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 precess around @xmath12 according to the t - bmt equation so that they would have rotated @xmath8 times after one turn .",
    "however a precession is added that continuously winds back @xmath8 precessions .",
    "these vectors are therefore periodic in the azimuth and @xmath13    since particles on the closed orbit have spins that precess around @xmath7 , the product @xmath14 is an invariant , i.e.  does not depend on @xmath15 . it can be shown that it is also an adiabatic invariant @xcite , i.e.  it hardly changes when parameters of the system , like the storage energy , are slowly changed .",
    "this concept of an invariant spin direction , a spin tune , a periodic system of unit vectors and an adiabatic invariant can be extended to particles that do not move on the closed orbit but oscillate around this orbit and whose motion is thus described by phase space trajectories @xmath16 .",
    "the t - bmt equation for spin motion then depends on the phase space trajectory @xmath17    if the vector field @xmath18 with @xmath19 describes the spin distribution in a particle beam , it is called a spin field and satisfies the t - bmt equation @xmath20 a special spin field that is periodic from turn to turn is called the invariant spin field @xmath1 , @xmath21    particles that travel along the trajectory @xmath16 have spins that precess around @xmath22 . describing this precession and",
    "even the number of precessions in one turn starting at @xmath23 is not trivial , since the particle has a new phase space point @xmath24 after one turn .",
    "an orthogonal set of unit vectors @xmath25 has to be defined for each phase space point and for each azimuth to determine spin precession angles .",
    "if the unit vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 would satisfy the t - bmt equation along each phase space trajectory starting at @xmath28 and ending at @xmath29 after one turn , these vectors would precess around @xmath1 and after one turn @xmath30 would have some angle @xmath31 with respect to the initial unit vectors @xmath32 at the same phase space point .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath33 is not well defined , since the direction of the @xmath34 before and after the turn is only required to be perpendicular to @xmath1 , but has a free angular orientation in the orthogonal plain . this free orientation for each phase space point",
    "can ( under certain general conditions @xcite ) be chosen to make the number of rotations @xmath35 independent of the orbital phase variables @xmath36 .",
    "it then only depends on the amplitudes @xmath37 of the orbital motion and is therefore called the amplitude dependent spin tune @xmath38 .    to obtain a periodic set of unit vectors , the described precession of the unit vectors is again augmented by continuously winding back @xmath35 spin precessions during one turn , @xmath39\\times\\vec u_i\\ .\\ ] ]    since spins precess around @xmath1 , the product is an invariant of motion , i.e.  it does not change with @xmath15 .",
    "it can be shown , however , that it is also an adiabatic invariant @xcite , i.e.  it hardly changes when system parameters like the storage energy change sufficiently slowly .",
    "this has strong implications . when a beam is polarized parallel to the invariant spin field @xmath40 at some initial energy @xmath41 and the storage energy is increased slowly , the beam will be polarized parallel to @xmath42 at the final energy @xmath43 .",
    "this is a very important property since a beam in such a polarization state will have the average polarization @xmath44 after acceleration , which can be large even if this average polarization is small at intermediate energies .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath35 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath45 will be computed for an analytically solvable model and the adiabatic invariance will be illustrated by letting a parameter of this model change .",
    "since this model leads to the froissart - stora formula , a comparison of its equations with the equations of general spin dynamics leads to the introduction of higher - order resonance strengths that can be used in the froissart - stora formula .",
    "the spin precession vector for particles which oscillate around the closed orbit can be decomposed into the closed - orbit contribution @xmath46 and a part @xmath47 due to the particles oscillations , @xmath48 . in the @xmath9 system",
    "we write @xmath49 with the complex notation @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the equation of spin motion is @xmath52 and the equation of motion for @xmath53 is obtained by multiplication with @xmath54 , and taking into account that @xmath55 , @xmath56 in a coordinate system that rotates by @xmath57 , this equation becomes @xmath58 spin precession on the closed orbit ( @xmath59 ) leads to a constant @xmath60 due to the left equation .",
    "the right equation describes additional precessions due to phase space motion .",
    "if the motion in phase space can be transformed to action - angle variables , the spin precession vector @xmath61 for particles which oscillate around the closed orbit is a @xmath62-periodic function of @xmath36 and @xmath15 .",
    "the fourier spectrum of @xmath63 has frequencies @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are integers and @xmath66 describes the tunes of synchrotron and betatron oscillations .",
    "the integer contributions @xmath67 are due to the @xmath62 periodicity of @xmath47 in @xmath15 and give rise to so - called imperfection resonances .",
    "the contributions @xmath68 of integer multiples of the orbit tunes are due to the @xmath62 periodicity of @xmath47 in the orbital phases @xmath69 and give rise to so - called intrinsic resonances @xcite .",
    "when one of the fourier frequencies is nearly in resonance with @xmath8 , one component of @xmath70 is nearly constant",
    ". then it can be a good approximation to drop all other fourier components since their influence on spin motion can average to zero so that they are in effect less dominant .",
    "this is referred to as the single resonance approximation .",
    "note that this approximation can only be good when the domains of influence of individual resonances are well separated .",
    "this model corresponds to the rotating field approximation often used to discuss spin resonance in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "note also that for a conventional flat ring , the first - order resonances due to vertical motion dominate and therefore the fourier components with frequencies @xmath71 are often of most interest .",
    "the amplitude of a single fourier contribution is sometimes called the resonance strength .",
    "this is misleading since generally it can not be used in the froissart - stora formula .",
    "the fact that the fourier component is not the resonance strength manifest itself clearly in models where where @xmath47 is linear and has only first - order fourier components , i.e.  those with @xmath72 .",
    "such a @xmath47 can lead to depolarization or spin flip at first - order resonances but also at higher - order resonances @xcite .",
    "the strength of these resonances that might be use in the froissart - stora formula can clearly not be determined by the higher order fourier coefficients , i.e.  those where @xmath73 , since those are zero .",
    "in fact all examples of higher - order resonances that will be shown in this paper were computed for such a linear model of hera - p with siberian snakes @xcite .    a higher order resonance can thus be created either by a higher - order fourier component or by feed - up of lower order components .",
    "such a feed - up can occur due to the inherent non - commutativity of three dimensional rotations or equivalently due to the nonlinearity of the mapping from the unit sphere to the complex plane which gives rise to the square root term in the equation of motion ( [ eq : hatbmt ] ) . obtaining a resonance strength @xmath74 that can be used to describe depolarization therefore has to include all these feed - up effects . before the following investigations it was not clear whether a froissart - stora formula with some resonance strength @xmath74 could be applied to crossing such higher - order resonances . but even if it can be applied , it is clear that the resonance strength can not be obtained from a fourier coefficient of @xmath47 in ( [ eq : hatbmt ] ) .",
    "moreover , in high energy accelerators , the @xmath75-th order fourier coefficients of @xmath47 are not even the dominant contribution to the strength of a @xmath75-th order resonance .",
    "usually the former contain @xmath76 , whereas the feed - up contributions from combining @xmath77 lower order harmonics , contain @xmath78 , which can be an exceedingly large number .    only for first - order resonances ,",
    "where @xmath72 , there is no feed - up contribution and the fourier components can generally be used in the froissart - stora formula and there are different straight forward ways of computing @xmath74 in that case @xcite .      the analytically solvable model advertised above is usually called the single resonance model ( srm ) .",
    "it has @xmath79 and an @xmath47 which only has one fourier contribution , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "note that the modulus of its higher - order fourier coefficient is denoted as @xmath74 since there are no lower order coefficients that could contribute to the resonance strength by a feed - up precess .",
    "any dependence on the orbital actions can be expressed by @xmath82 .",
    "this @xmath47 is perpendicular to @xmath7 and tilts spins away from @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath83 , the frequency is @xmath64 and the equation of motion ( [ eq : hatbmt ] ) becomes @xmath84 when the coordinates in the @xmath85 $ ] system are arranged in column vectors @xcite , one obtains @xmath86 initial coordinates @xmath28 are taken into final coordinates @xmath87 after one turn according to the relation @xmath88 whence @xmath89 . now",
    "the orthogonal matrix @xmath90 is introduced to describe a rotation around a unit vector @xmath91 by an angle @xmath92 . transforming the spin components of @xmath93 into a rotating frame using the relation @xmath94 ,",
    "one obtains the simplified equation of spin motion @xmath95 if a spin field is oriented parallel to @xmath96 in this frame , it does not change from turn to turn .",
    "therefore @xmath97 is an invariant spin field . in the original frame , this @xmath1-axis is @xmath98 where the ` sign factor ' @xmath99 has been chosen so that on the closed orbit ( @xmath100 ) the @xmath1-axis @xmath101 coincides with @xmath102 .",

    "this analytically solvable model can also be used to illustrate the construction of a phase independent but amplitude - dependent spin tune @xmath38 .",

    "( [ eq : shatodesrm ] ) and the equation for a general system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shatode ] ) to show how higher - order resonance strength can be introduced and how they can be computed .",
    "for the analytically solvable srm the change of the adiabatic invariant @xmath155 can be computed explicitly . when the design - orbit spin tune changes during the acceleration process , resonances will be encountered , where @xmath35 jumps from @xmath156 to @xmath157 while the spin is under the strong influence of an approximately resonant fourier contribution of @xmath158 .",
    "it is then found that for some speeds of the spin tune change , parametrized by @xmath159 , a reduction of polarization can occur is due to a generally irreversible reduction of @xmath45 rather than a temporary decrease of @xmath123 , and which does not recover after the energy has increased and the resonance is crossed .    to describe the reduction of polarization during resonance crossing , ( [ eq : shatodesrm ] ) can be used but the usual approach is to insert a changing closed orbit spin tune @xmath8 into the equation of motion ( [ eq : bmtsrm ] ) .",

    "if the closed - orbit spin tune changes like @xmath161 , the equation of spin motion can be solved in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "the equations for arbitrary initial conditions are quite complicated but when at @xmath162 a vertical spin @xmath163 is chosen as the initial condition then the vertical component at @xmath164 is given by the well known and regularly used froissart - stora formula @xcite , @xmath165 in the case of a strong perturbation @xmath74 , or when the acceleration is very slow , spins follow the change of @xmath166 . the @xmath1-axis in ( [ eq : srmn ] ) has a discontinuity from @xmath167 just below resonance to @xmath168 just above resonance .",

    ". therefore @xmath170 is close to @xmath171 for a slow change of @xmath8 .",

    "the polarization is preserved but the spins are reversed . in the second case the polarization is preserved without reversal . in the third case the polarization is no longer vertical but precesses around the vertical so that the time averaged polarization is reduced .",
    "as mentioned above , the froissart - stora formula in eq.([eq : froissart ] ) is regularly used to describe the reduction of polarization due to vertical betatron motion during resonance crossing in accelerators where the closed - orbit spin tune @xmath8 changes with energy .",
    "these descriptions were normally restricted to flat rings and @xmath142 .    since siberian snakes @xcite are unavoidable for high - energy polarized beam acceleration , the design - orbit spin tune is @xmath0 in most cases which will be considered here and it does not change during acceleration .",
    "since the orbital tunes are never chosen to be @xmath0 , first - order resonances with @xmath173 are avoided and higher - order resonances can become dominant .",
    "but since the strength of such resonances can not be obtained as a fourier coefficient of @xmath174 , a method for obtaining the strength of the higher - order resonances is required in order to use the froissart - stora formula when siberian snakes are in use .",

    "[ fg : nlres ] that the spin tune @xmath182 has discontinuities at some of the resonances .    when spin motion in a ring is approximated by a single resonance with @xmath71 and then siberian snakes are included in the ring , it has often been noted that only odd - order resonances with @xmath189 appear , i.e.  @xmath190 is odd .",
