    "note that there is a natural @xmath553$]-module structure on @xmath458 : here @xmath164 is a meridian , thus belongs to the boundary of @xmath265 . over @xmath553",

    "hence @xmath551 , as a @xmath553 $ ] module , is spanned by @xmath555 .    note",
    "that @xmath556 is the closure in the sense of section [ d3 ] of a braid on @xmath557 strands , while @xmath558 is the closure of a braid on @xmath559 strands .",
    "moreover , @xmath560 is the closure of a braid on @xmath561 strands , while @xmath562 is the closure of of a braid on @xmath563 strands .",
    "lemma [ disk21 ] shows that @xmath564 , as an element of @xmath492 $ ] , has @xmath168-degree @xmath565 , with highest coefficient invertible and of the form a power of @xmath44 .",
    "hence when we factor out @xmath492 $ ] by @xmath551 , we get a free @xmath553$]-module with representatives @xmath566 as a basis .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "the same proof shows that the theorem still holds true if we replace the ground ring @xmath567 $ ] by @xmath568 $ ] .    for two - bridge knots one has @xmath569 , the ring of regular functions on the character variety .",
    "[ phu ]    by the result of @xcite , the ring @xmath570 is @xmath571/(\\varphi(\\bar x,\\bar y))$ ] , where @xmath572 is a polynomial of @xmath573-degree @xmath79 , with leading coefficient 1 . here",
    "@xmath574 , @xmath573 are respectively the traces of the loop @xmath575 .",
    "the corollary follows immediately .",
    "when @xmath577 , the field @xmath30 of rational functions in @xmath13 is a flat @xmath553$]-module , since @xmath30 contains the fractional field of @xmath553 $ ] as a subfield .",
    "hence the following sequence , which is obtained from ( [ sao200 ] ) by tensoring with @xmath30 , is exact    @xmath578}{{\\mathcal p}}\\ , \\hookrightarrow\\ , { { \\mathcal r}}(m)\\otimes_{{{\\mathcal r}}[x]}{{\\mathcal t}}^\\sigma \\,\\overset{id \\otimes \\theta}{\\longrightarrow}{{\\mathcal r}}(m)\\otimes_{{{\\mathcal r}}[x ] } { { \\mathcal s}}(x ) \\label{sao201}\\ ] ]    note that the first module @xmath579}{{\\mathcal p}}$ ] is exactly @xmath580 , the left - ideal extension of @xmath321 from @xmath153 to @xmath32 .",
    "it s easy to check that the second module @xmath579}{{\\mathcal t}}^\\sigma$ ] is @xmath32 .",
    "one can now rewrite ( [ sao201 ] ) as      the third module is a finite - dimensional @xmath30-vector space ; in fact , its basis is @xmath582 , since @xmath458 is @xmath553$]-free with the same basis , by theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "the middle module @xmath32 is an @xmath30-vector space of infinite dimension ; in fact , its basis is @xmath583 .",
    "thus the kernel @xmath580 is never 0 , and hence its generator @xmath584 is not 0 .",
    "moreover the image of @xmath585 elements @xmath586 are linearly dependent .",
    "hence there must be a non - trivial element in the kernel of @xmath12-degree less than or equal to @xmath79 .",
    "this is because @xmath329 is divisible by the recurrence polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "note that the existence of recurrence relations for _ arbitrary _ knots was established in @xcite by another method .",
    "but in @xcite the @xmath12-degree is much larger .",
    "consider again the exact sequence ( [ sao200 ] ) , but now as sequence of modules over @xmath567 $ ] , a principle ideal domain . by assumption ,",
    "the last module @xmath458 is free over @xmath50 .",
    "hence when tensoring ( [ sao200 ] ) with any @xmath50-module , one gets an exact sequence .",
    "in particular , tensoring with @xmath52 , considered as @xmath50-module by putting @xmath48 , one has the exact sequence                      \\(c ) suppose @xmath281 has @xmath12-degree @xmath82",

    "@xmath332is @xmath13-essentially divisible by @xmath276 .",
    "hence the @xmath12-degree of @xmath329 must be exactly @xmath79 , and also          recall that @xmath603 is a polynomial by proposition [ divi ] . from ( [ sao ] ) and the fact that the @xmath12-degree of @xmath38 is bigger than 1 ( proposition [ deg2 ] ) it follows that the @xmath12-degree of @xmath368 is less than @xmath82 , which is the @xmath12-degree of @xmath281",
    ". hence if @xmath281 is @xmath81-irreducible , from ( [ 600 ] ) one must have @xmath604 and @xmath605 .",
