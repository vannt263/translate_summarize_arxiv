    "quantification of pure state bipartite entanglement , a concept that emerged immediately after the first systematization of quantum mechanics @xcite , is by now well understood in terms of the entropic content in the reduced states of the constituent subsystems , as lucidly pointed out for the first time by schrdinger @xcite .",
    "the universal properties that any _ bona fide _ measure of entanglement has to satisfy have been thoroughly discussed and characterized in recent years @xcite . for pure states of bipartite systems ,",
    "the von neumann entropy is the unique measure of entanglement , and all other consistent measures are monotonic functions of the former @xcite .",
    "however , this uniqueness is lost in bipartite mixed states : in this context , measures that differ according to their definitions and/or operational meaning , such as , for instance , the entanglement of formation , the distillable entanglement , the relative entropy of entanglement , and the negativity @xcite , quantify different forms of entanglement .",
    "in fact , very few of these quantities can be computed explicitly for mixed quantum states , even in the simplest instances .",
    "a notable exception is the celebrated wootters formula for the entanglement of formation of arbitrary two - qubit mixed states , obtained in terms of the concurrence @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes even more complex in the multipartite instance , already at the level of pure states in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "progress has been achieved mainly in understanding the different ways in which multipartite systems can be entangled .",
    "the intrinsic nonlocal character of entanglement imposes invariance and monotonicity constraints under local quantum operations .",
    "equivalence classes of entangled states can be defined with respect to the group of reversible stochastic local quantum operations assisted by classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite .",
    "such an approach has allowed to demonstrate that three and four qubits can be entangled , respectively , in two and nine different inequivalent ways @xcite . in the case of three qubits ,",
    "the representatives of the two inequivalent classes are , notoriously , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states @xcite .    simplifying to the essential , in a multipartite scenario a legitimate quantification of entanglement",
    "can be achieved by identifying a positive function that is an entanglement monotone ( vanishing on separable states and not increasing under slocc ) , and is endowed with some kind of operational interpretation .",
    "several measures satisfying these requirements have been proposed . for a system of three qubits , wootters and co - workers",
    "defined the so - called residual entanglement , or @xmath5-tangle , a quantity constructed as the difference between the squared three - qubit concurrence and the squared concurrences of the reduced two - qubit states @xcite . while successfully detecting the genuine tripartite entanglement in the state @xmath6 , the @xmath5-tangle ( or residual tangle ) vanishes if computed for the state @xmath7 , thus being not appropriate for the quantification of tripartite entanglement in this class of states .",
    "in other words , a non vanishing residual tangle is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "the schmidt measure , defined as the minimum of @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the minimum of the number of terms in an expansion of a quantum state in product basis , has been proposed by eisert and briegel as an alternative measure of multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "other proposals are given as functions of the various bipartite entanglements contained in a multipartite state @xcite .",
    "the seed representative of this class of measures is the global entanglement of meyer and wallach , that for an @xmath0-qubit state is defined as the sum of all the possible two - qubit concurrences @xcite .",
    "a different set of entanglement quantifiers is defined in purely geometric terms .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement ( generalized for multipartite settings ) and the so - called geometric entanglement belong to this class @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement is defined as the distance of a given state from the set of fully separated states , quantified in terms of the quantum relative entropy @xcite .",
    "the geometric entanglement was originally defined as the euclidean distance of a given multipartite state to the nearest fully separable state @xcite .",
    "this last measure can be considered as one of the most reliable quantifiers of global multi - particle entanglement @xcite : it exhibits interesting connections with other measures @xcite and can be efficiently estimated by quantitative entanglement witnesses amenable of experimental verification @xcite .",
    "given an @xmath0-partite pure state @xmath10 , the geometric measure of entanglement introduced by wei and goldbart @xcite is defined as : @xmath11 where the maximum is taken with respect to all pure states that are fully factorized , i.e. the @xmath0-separable states @xmath12 where the states @xmath13 are single - qubit pure states .",
    "this measure is intrinsically geometric because it coincides with the distance ( in the hilbert - schmidt norm ) between a given pure state and the set of fully separable ( i.e. fully product ) pure states .",
    "the wei - goldbart geometric measure is thus a global quantifier of entanglement , including all the bipartite and multipartite contributions .",
    "the geometric measure can be extended by the convex roof procedure to the case of mixed states , and , analogously to the meyer - wallach global entanglement , is a proper multipartite entanglement monotone .",
    "remarkably , the geometric measure can be effectively exploited to quantify the entanglement of two distinct multipartite bound entangled states @xcite and to study the behavior of global entanglement at the approach of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "however , notwithstanding the very appealing properties and the important results cited above , the global nature of the wei - goldbart geometric entanglement constitutes a limitation insofar as it does not allow to distinguish and discriminate among the different bipartite and multipartite contributions to the overall entanglement , to determine their properties , and to establish a systematic hierarchy among them .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to fill this gap .",
    "+ in this paper , we define and study in detail a natural and powerful multipartite generalization of the geometric measure of entanglement for pure states of many - qubit systems .",
    "we first introduce a compact and convenient parametrization to express analytically general @xmath1-separable states of @xmath0-qubit systems ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we then analyze the behavior of the distance between pure @xmath0-qubit states and the set of @xmath1-separable states ( @xmath2 ) in order to determine and distinguish the different multipartite contributions to the geometric entanglement and characterize their ordering .",
    "the different distances , corresponding to @xmath2 , quantify hierarchically the different forms of multipartite entanglement present in the given @xmath0-qubit state . in section [ secgme ] , we define the multi - component generalization of the geometric measure , we review the known results in the case of full separability and , for this latter case , we also present some further extended results . in section [ secksepgme ] we evaluate explicitly the generalized multi - component geometric measure of entanglement , considering genuine @xmath1-separability ( @xmath15 ) . we analyze the detailed behavior of the different forms of geometric entanglement for various relevant classes of @xmath0-qubit states , establishing some generic and asymptotic properties , and we determine the explicit hierarchy holding for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , cluster , and multi - magnon states . in the case of @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , the established relations between the different forms of multipartite geometric entanglement clarify the original result of wei and goldbart that @xmath3 states possess a larger total entanglement content than @xmath4 states , when quantified by the geometric measure .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath0-qubit @xmath3 states , we find that the geometric entanglement is scale - invariant ( self - similar ) as the total number of qubits grows at the same rate as the number of subsystems in each party . we show that the property of self - similarity is enjoyed by other symmetric states as well , as a direct consequence of the invariance under permutation of any two qubits , which is the characterizing property of symmetric states .",
    "we then analyze and determine the different multipartite components of geometric entanglement for arbitrary symmetric superpositions of @xmath0-qubit @xmath4 and @xmath3 states .",
    "in section [ secgeneralw ] we compute the multipartite geometric measures for classes of generalized @xmath3 states beyond the single - excitation regime : these are general symmetric states , the so - called magnon states , that are of crucial importance , for instance , in the theory of magnetism .",
    "furthermore , we determine the multipartite components of geometric entanglement in generalized , asymmetric @xmath3-like superposition states . in this and related cases , at variance with most of the symmetric instances ,",
    "a complete characterization of entanglement requires the determination of all the multipartite geometric components , which we compute explicitly . finally , in section [ conclusions ] we discuss some general conjectures on generic properties and typical behaviors of the geometric entanglement , and examine some outlooks on possible future lines of research .",
    "let us consider a @xmath0-qubit system , corresponding to a tensor - product state space @xmath16 of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "for such a system , let us introduce the integer @xmath1 , @xmath18 , and the ordered sequence of integers @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider the @xmath1-partition of the system in @xmath1 subsystems described by the sets @xmath22 .",
    "let each set @xmath23 be composed of @xmath24 elementary parties , i.e. @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a discrete index labeling the @xmath0 elementary parties , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",

    "each state @xmath31 belongs to the hilbert space @xmath32 of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "a @xmath1-separable state can then be written as @xmath34 correspondingly , the hilbert space @xmath16 is decomposed in the tensor product @xmath35 .",
    "varying the integers @xmath36 , one obtains different @xmath1-partitions @xmath29 and , correspondingly , different possible @xmath1-separable states .",
    "it is worth noticing that even at fixed @xmath37 , there exist different @xmath1-partitions associated with the different arrangements of the elementary parties in the sets @xmath23 ; in fact , from a given initial @xmath1-partition , a certain number of different @xmath1-partitions can be generated through permutations of the elementary parties belonging to different sets @xmath23 .",
    "we then denote by @xmath38 the set of all @xmath1-separable states , defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the set of all the @xmath1-separable states associated to a fixed @xmath1-partition .",
    "we can now define the relative ( i.e. partition - dependent ) and the absolute ( i.e. partition - independent ) geometric measures of entanglement with respect to @xmath1-separable pure states for an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit pure state @xmath41 , respectively , as : @xmath42 where the squared overlap @xmath43 and @xmath44 where the squared overlap @xmath45 by eqs .",

    "therefore , in such a case , in the definitions ( [ gmerel ] ) and ( [ overlap2rel ] ) , the symbols @xmath23 can be replaced by the indices @xmath24 as the multi - index @xmath53 completely determines the particular component of geometric entanglement . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measure ( [ gmeabs ] ) is defined only in the simplest instance of @xmath0-separability . in this case , we may write the general expression for a ( normalized ) @xmath1-separable state @xmath54 , eq .",
