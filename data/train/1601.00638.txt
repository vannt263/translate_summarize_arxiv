    "while most interpretations of the 750 gev diphoton excess recently reported by atlas and cms @xcite assume gluon production ( for a sample of such studies , see for example  @xcite ) , a more minimal scenario via photoproduction ( as proposed in  @xcite ) is also plausible .",
    "the photoproduction cross section for a 750 gev resonance is able to account for the entire excess provided the resonance has sizable @xmath7 branching ratio to two photons . in this paper",
    ", we simulate the two production scenarios , provide the full cross sections taking into account both elastic and inelastic photoproduction , and present kinematical distributions useful for discriminating between the two scenarios for the production of the hypothetical resonance .",
    "complementary to this paper , ref .",
    "@xcite has studied quark - antiquark annihilation production of the resonance .",
    "the production process of a 750 gev diphoton resonance has observable features in the kinematical distribution of events in the signal region .",
    "in particular , the color flow of photon fusion ( @xmath8f ) or @xmath9 fusion processes would suppress the production of central hadronic activity resulting in fewer central jets compared to a gluon fusion ( @xmath10f ) signal while also enhancing the number of central pseudorapidity gaps , central regions of the detector absent of hadronic activity .",
    "the kinematic properties of the events in the region of the diphoton excess are reported to have no significant difference compared to events above and below the excess diphoton invariant mass region .",
    "we find that this is consistent at 3.2 fb@xmath0 of data with a resonance produced dominantly through either @xmath11f or @xmath10f , assuming the background makes approximately half of the detected events as suggested by the number of diphoton events predicted and observed in the excess region by atlas  @xcite .",
    "however , the additional jet multiplicity expected from a @xmath10f signal compared to the expected jet multiplicity from the dominant irreducible diphoton background events would already suggest an approximately 1.5-@xmath12 excess in the total number of jets in the signal region @xmath13 gev for the 38 events measured by atlas if the resonance were produced though @xmath10f .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of the central rapidity gap rate , expected from the signal @xmath8f and background events but exponentially suppressed in @xmath10f events , could discriminate between a vbf or @xmath10f signal but requires special care in order to ensure central tracks originating from pileup do not bury the signature .    due to differences in the shape of parton distribution functions and the kinematics between @xmath8f and @xmath10f events",
    ", the resonance tends to be produced more forward in @xmath11f production .",
    "we note that this affects the rapidity distribution of the photons , preferring rapidities corresponding to the detector end caps more often than gluon fusion produced events , although this effect alone is not sufficiently large to fully account for the large end cap excess in the cms diphoton search @xcite .",
    "we find that photons from a decaying heavy scalar resonance are more often central than photons from background events and tend to be detected in the detector barrel rather than the end caps .",
    "if the hypothetical resonance has a large width and the large excess in the 700 gev bin of the cms search is to be considered a signal , then this result is in tension with the interpretation of the large fraction of cms diphoton events with one photon detected in the barrel and one detected in the end cap ( ebee category ) as a scalar resonance signal .",
    "the situation for a wide resonance is improved for a spin-2 resonance for which one expects more events in the ebee category than for a scalar signal .",
    "elastic photoproduction events result in forward and backward protons which can be detected by forward detectors installed by atlas and cms  @xcite .",
    "elastic production is suppressed with respect to inelastic .",
    "however , the detection of two intact protons in the final state , with @xmath14 matched to @xmath15 , can be used to remove background .",
    "it was estimated in  @xcite that approximately 20 fb@xmath0 is needed for a 5-@xmath12 discovery in this channel . in this paper",
    "we use this luminosity as a benchmark to characterize which features of the production mechanism may be apparent in the kinematic properties of excess events at or before 20 fb@xmath0 of data .",
    ". ]    following @xcite",
    ", we will consider a model with an additional scalar particle @xmath16 with mass @xmath17 gev whose only sizable coupling to sm particles is to photons via the operator @xmath18 with @xmath19 gev introduced to have dimensionless couplings , resulting in a partial width to photons @xmath20 of @xmath21     and total width @xmath22 to match the observed event rate , varied between 3 - 6 fb , assuming photon fusion dominates .",
    "the central value ( red ) corresponds to a 4.5 fb production cross section . ]    in this paper , we include the contributions from inelastic - inelastic , elastic - inelastic , and elastic - elastic processes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : photoproduction ] ) . in the narrow width approximation ,",
    "the total photoproduction cross section at @xmath23 tev is @xmath24 determined at leading order ( lo ) from madgraph 5  @xcite with the parton distribution function set nn23lo1  @xcite . for elastic collisions ,",
    "the equivalent photon approximation is made with the improved weizsacker - williams formula  @xcite in order to account for the electromagnetic form factor of the proton .",
    "inelastic collisions dominate the production followed by partially elastic and elastic collisions in the ratios 63:33:4 , respectively . here , we see that the rate of @xmath25-@xmath26 fb ( corresponding to the excess number of events observed by atlas ) can be accommodated by a photoproduced resonance with total width of @xmath27 gev , motivated by the best - fit width of the atlas excess , with branching ratio to two photons of approximately 2% .",
    "if we allow the total width @xmath22 to vary , the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath22 is fixed by matching the observed event rate of the excess and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : brvsgamma ] .",
    "we assume @xmath29 gev for the remainder of this paper , although the conclusions still apply for a narrower resonance .",
    "the total production cross section at @xmath30 tev is @xmath31 the ratio @xmath32 determined from madgraph is approximately 2 and does not provide an explanation for the absence of a signal in run i diphoton searches .",
    "however , the ratio for elastic and partially elastic production depends strongly on the finite size effects of the proton , or equivalently the maximum fraction of the proton momentum transferred to an emitted photon , and can be larger than 2 depending on the correct value  @xcite .",
    "and gluon coupling @xmath33 to match the observed event rate , varied between 3 - 6 fb , assuming gluon fusion dominates .",

    "the ratio @xmath32 , determined from madgraph , for @xmath38 is 4.5 . matching the diphoton cross section to the observed excess event rate determines the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath33 as shown in fig .",

    "the production mechanism of a 750 gev resonance can be probed by measuring the hadronic observables in the diphoton signal events .",
    "the most prominent features in the @xmath8f events compared to @xmath10f are the suppression of central jets with @xmath39 and the appearance of central pseudorapidity gaps .",
    "these effects are absent for a resonance produced via @xmath10f because the two incoming protons are color - connected , and the color flux tube breaking fills up the central region with soft hadrons from the fragmentation .",
    "however , for a @xmath40-channel exchange of a color - singlet , as in photoproduction , the remnants from each initial proton remain color singlets and only form color connections with partons originating within the same proton , typically resulting in very forward jets ( or intact protons ) with a pseudorapidity gap in the central region .",
    "the two forward jets expected in @xmath9 fusion , from the parton recoil after emitting the heavy gauge boson , are typically not detected in @xmath11f production , although two forward jets would be a signature of a resonance produced via @xmath9 fusion .",
    "these observables have been well - studied for vbf higgs production  @xcite . for the higgs ,",
    "@xmath10f dominates the cross section , making the hadronic observables of the vbf events difficult to measure . for a 750 gev photoproduced diphoton resonance ,",
    "however , the event color flow effects of the vbf production should be observable since the small background rate in the diphoton channel does not bury the signal .",
    "one experimental challenge is then to remove pileup which contaminate the events with central hadronic activity . on average , there are between 10 - 20 inelastic collisions per bunch crossing at 2015 run ii luminosities .",
    "atlas and cms have powerful tracking capabilities making possible the matching of jets to the hard interaction and identification of pileup jets  @xcite . to remove the jets resulting from pileup ,",
    "only the jets matching the primary vertex of the hard interaction should be considered .",
    "cms has shown the efficiency to match jets with @xmath41 gev to the hard interaction to be @xmath42 in  @xcite and to be flat over the range @xmath43 , corresponding to the rapidity acceptance of the tracker .",
    "pileup tracks must also be subtracted from the event in order to observe central rapidity gaps . only tracks matched to the diphoton primary vertex , perhaps by a longitudinal impact parameter cut , should be considered in determining whether an event contains a pseudorapidity gap .",
    "this pileup subtraction procedure may be non - standard , and the presence of central pileup tracks not matched to the primary vertex could bury this signal if special care is not taken .    in this section , we present the results of the event generation and fast detector simulation for the two production scenarios of a 750 gev scalar or tensor diphoton resonance and the dominant irreducible diphoton background at @xmath23 tev .",

    "<S> the production mechanism of a 750 gev diphoton resonance , either via gluon or photon fusion , can be probed by studying kinematic observables in the diphoton events . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detector study of the two production modes of a hypothetical scalar or tensor diphoton resonance in order to characterize the features of the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the resonance production can be determined from the jet multiplicity , the jet and diphoton rapidities , the rate of central pseudorapidity gaps , or the possible detection of forward protons from elastic photoproduction for events in the signal region . </S>",
    "<S> kinematic distributions for both signals and expected irreducible diphoton background events are provided for comparison along with a study of observables useful for distinguishing the two scenarios at an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that decay photons from a 750 gev scalar resonance have a preference for acceptance in the central detector barrel , while background events are more likely to give accepted photons in the detector end caps . </S>",
    "<S> this disfavors the interpretation of the large number of excess events found by the the run-2 cms diphoton search with one photon detected in the end cap as a wide spin-0 resonance signal . </S>",
    "<S> however , one expects more end cap photons in the case of spin-2 resonance .    </S>",
