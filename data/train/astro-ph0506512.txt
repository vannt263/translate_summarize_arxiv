    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a class of neutron stars , numbering about half a dozen , which are radio - quiet , with periods of the order @xmath1s and estimated ages of @xmath2 to @xmath3yr . like the soft gamma - ray repeaters",
    ", they are thought to be _ magnetars _ , whose emission is powered by the decay of a super - strong magnetic field ( @xmath4 g ) .",
    "see woods & thompson ( 2004 ) for a review of the known magnetars and their properties .    while energetically , the emission at x - ray energies dominates , optical and infrared photometry of axps is giving interesting constraints on the physical processes of the stellar magnetospheres .",
    "particularly intriguing is that for the brightest object , 4u  0142 + 61 , the optical spectral energy distribution is not just a power law .",
    "it shows , unique among neutron stars , a spectral break between v and b ( hulleman et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , because of the uncertainty in the high amount of reddening , the precise shape can not be measured .    in the magnetar model",
    ", the optical emission could be dues to ion cyclotron emission .",
    "if so , the spectral break should be a general feature ( c. thompson , 2004 , priv comm . ) due to the existence of a _ cooling radius _ in the magnetar magnetosphere from within which ions do not radiate ( for a brief discussion , see hulleman et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath5 other axps known so far are , unfortunately , too highly reddened to be detected in v or b. another prediction is that the spectra of different axps should be similar , but again uncertainties in the reddening do not allow us to test this ( e.g. durant & van kerkwijk , 2005 ) . as an alternative model , eichler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , considered the possibility of coherent optical and infrared emission from the lower magnetosphere of a magnetar , in analogy to some radio pulsar models .",
    "unfortunately , no clear predictions for the spectral shape were made .",
    "for the purposes of investigating the optical spectra of axps , the recent discovery of an axp in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 ( lamb et al . , 2002 ; majid et al . , 2004 ) is particularly interesting .",
    "it is the only axp found so far , that is not confined to the disc of the milky way .",
    "the reddening to this source is , therefore , much less than for the other axps .",
    "furthermore , its distance is relatively well known at 60.6(1.0 ) kpc ( e.g. hilditch et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "it thus presents a unique opportunity to study an axp in the blue / uv .",
    "seeking imaging data on cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 , we searched all the archives available t us .",
    "we found that the field was observed on 20 april 2004 with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , as part of a snapshot programme for three - colour photometry of several patches of the smc ( tolstoy , 1999 ) .",
    "single exposures were taken of 230s in the near - ultraviolet f300w , 180s in the `` broad v '' f606w and 300s in cousins i - like f814w filters .",
    "the position of our object of interest is on chip wf2 of the wfpc2 array .",
    "we determined an astrometric solution by matching sources off the wf2 image to objects in the usno b1.0 catalogue ( monet et al . , 2003 ) , and fitting for offset , rotation and scale .",
    "eight stars were matched , after rejecting 7 objects which had poorly measured positions or which corresponded to multiple sources on the wf2 image . with these eight sources ,",
    "the uncertainty in the astrometric fit is @xmath6 in each co - ordinate for the f606w frame .",
    "the uncertainty in applying the astrometry to the other two bands was negligible in comparison .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in connecting the usno astrometry to the international celestial reference system is @xmath7 in each co - ordinate , and the uncertainty in the _ chandra _ position of cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 is a radius @xmath8 at 90% confidence .",
    "note that the latter is from the nominal _ chandra _ performance , despite being somewhat off - axis ( lamb et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the above numbers , combined in quadrature , give a total uncertainty in the axp s position on our images of @xmath9 at 90% confidence .",
    "photometry was performed using hstphot 1.1 ( dolphin , 2000 ) .",
    "figure [ field ] shows the f606w image of the field immediately around cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 , with the positional error circle indicated .",
    "stars x and y have positions consistent with that of the axp , with star z being a nearby , much brighter source .",
    "their positions and magnitudes are listed in table [ phot ] , and indicated in a colour - magnitude diagramme of all stars detected in the wfpc2 images in figure [ cmd ] .    from the photometry ,",
    "star y is consistent with being a g5v star at the distance and reddening of the smc , and star z an early b - type star .",
    "the colours and magnitudes of star x do not correspond to any known stellar type , and make it a clear out - lier in figure [ cmd ] , suggesting a very blue , possibly hot object . based on its position and unusual colours ,",
    "we therefore consider star x a likely counterpart to cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 .",

    "star x is the proposed counterpart , and stars y and z its nearest neighbours .",
    "the circle shows the uncertainty in the chandra position at 90% confidence . ]",
    "stars y and z are labelled , and star x is shown as a limit .",
    "the effect of one magnitude of visual reddening is shown by the dashed line . ]    as a caveat , however , it should be remembered that this measurement is based on a single f606w exposure .",
    "the source in figure [ field ] does not appear like a cosmic ray hit , and the hstphot @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters are within reasonable limits for a point source : @xmath15 ( goodness of fit parameter ; reasonable values : @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( where 0 corresponds to a stellar point spread function , positive values to more peaked profiles and negative values to more diffuse ones ; reasonable values : -0.5 0.5 ) .",
    "there were no bad pixels within star x s profile .    in order to test the robustness of this identification , we estimated the likelihood of such a detection in an error circle of this size at any point on this chip of the detector .",
    "we searched the photometry for all objects in the f606w image which are classified as stellar ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , and with @xmath20 , i.e. at least as blue as star x. forty such objects are found on the same chip as star x ( including those near star x in figure [ cmd ] ) , giving the probability of one falling within a circle of radius @xmath21 of @xmath22% .",
    "we note that the majority of these are within 3 pixels of brighter sources in the f814w image , and consequently were not detected in that band .",
    "since this does not apply to star x , and there do not appear to be any artifacts close to it ( i.e. the location of star x appears like sky in the f814w image ) , the chance of it being a false detection is somewhat smaller , but how much smaller is hard to quantify .",
    "we also calculated the likelihood of our putative detection being due to a cosmic ray hit or instrumental effects .",
    "we searched for objects which are classified as stars in terms of their _ chi _ and _ sharp _ parameters as above , which were detected in f300w but not in f606w .",
    "we find thirteen objects , which implies that the probability of star x being due to a cosmic rays hit or purely instrumental effects is 0.4% ( after correcting for the difference in exposure time between f300w and f606w ) .    seeking to confirm this detection , we searched other archives for optical images .",
    "we found a v - band image from the wide field imager ( wfi ) on the 2.2 m eso telescope , la silla , chile .",
    "this demonstrated that the area of sky was very crowded , and extremely good seeing would be required to separate and securely detect star x. in this case , the seeing was poor .",
    "we also obtained gemini ddt observations with gmos - s ( crampton & murowinski , 2004 ) at cerro pachon , chile .",
    "unfortunately , the seeing was also not good enough in these images to distinguish between the sources in the crowded field .",
    "a proposal was also accepted at magellan , las campanas , chile , but conditions have not been good enough to obtain images so far .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of star z means that only the most exceptional seeing conditions will allow further measurements of this object from the ground .",
    "taking star x as the true optical counterpart , cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 has an x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath23 ( un - absorbed x - ray flux in the 210kev range from woods & thompson , 2004 ; visual @xmath24 flux is de - reddened using @xmath25 [ hilditch et al . , 2005 ] , and assumes @xmath26 ) .",
    "this compares with @xmath27 for 4u  0142@xmath2861 ( for @xmath29 , the nominal reddening ) , the only other axp with an optical detection ( hulleman et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "clearly the two ratios are very different .",
    "it has been observed that infrared to x - ray flux ratios are similar for those axps with secure measurements ( 4u  0142@xmath2861 , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 and 1e  2259@xmath28586 ; durant & van kerkwijk , 2005 ) .",
    "variations have , however , been observed to be very large , of orders of magnitude in some cases .",
    "for example the _ transient axp _ xte  j1810 - 197 ( ibrahim et al , 2004 ) increased dramatically in both x - rays and infrared flux before slowly dimming again .",
    "it is possible that the difference in v - band to x - ray flux ratio above arises because the measurements for cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 were not simultaneous ; the axp could have been brighter by a large factor at the time of the hst observation .",
    "cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 was observed to be @xmath30% brighter in x - rays by majid et al .",
    "( 2004 ) than lamb et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but they attribute this to the different instruments used to make the observations rather than genuine variability . 4u  0142@xmath2861 has been the most stable of the axps in both x - ray and optical flux ( hulleman et al . ,",
    "this could , in principle , mean that the intrinsic spectra of the two objects are very different , possibly indicating differing magnetic field configurations .",
    "the limit in f814w already provides some constraints on the shape of the optical spectrum . whilst a rayleigh - jeans form @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 is possible , a flat spectrum ( @xmath33 ) is excluded .",
    "the 90% confidence limit is @xmath34 . since the spectrum should not increase steeper than rayleigh - jeans ( in the absence of an emission feature ) , we predict that the i - band magnitude is not much below the limit we have established .",
    "the f300w limit is not constraining in this respect .    in summary ,",
    "we present star x , with @xmath35 , as the probable optical counterpart to cxou  j010043.1@xmath0721134 .",
    "it is at the right location and has colours unlike normal stellar sources .",
    "although based on a detection in a single exposure , hstphot diagnostics point to it being a real detection , with only a @xmath36% probability of a false detection . if confirmed , this discovery will enable the measurement of axp properties in the blue and uv .",
