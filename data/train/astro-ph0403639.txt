    "stars with m@xmath5 30m@xmath6 go through a wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase in their evolution , during which they undergo large scale mass loss ( @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 year@xmath10 ) .",
    "consequently they display broad emission line spectra and large infrared excesses originating in their accelerated stellar winds ( wind terminal velocity v@xmath11=7505000 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "they are post - main sequence stars which have lost most of their hydrogen envelopes through stellar winds in the pre - wr stage .",
    "based on the emission lines seen , they are classified as wn stars ( lines of he , n and h ) , wc and wo stars ( lines of he , c and o ) .",
    "late wc stars ( wc79 ) show evidence of circumstellar dust , mainly of amorphous carbon ( williams 1995 ) .",
    "some of them are persistent dust makers which show continuous dust formation and others are episodic dust makers , where we see periodic rises in their ir flux due to episodic formation of dust .",
    "it is believed , now , that episodic dust making wc stars are massive binary systems in which the stellar winds of two massive stars interact . wr 140 ( hd 193793 ) is the prototype of colliding - wind , episodic dust forming wc stars ( williams 1995 ) .    from the photometry of the infrared maxima in 1977 and 1985 and earlier data ,",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found that the occurence of the ir maxima and the dust formation were periodic and derived a period of 7.9 years .",
    "studying the existing radial velocity data , from which no orbit had previously been derived , they showed that wr 140 was indeed a spectroscopic binary with high eccentricity .",
    "this was extended to a multi - wavelength study , including 1.6512.6 @xmath1 m light curves , radio and x - ray data by williams et al .",
    "( 1990 , hereafter w90 ) , who derived a photometric period @xmath12 days ( 7.94 y ) and a spectroscopic orbit from published radial velocities giving elements @xmath13 , @xmath14=32@xmath158@xmath16 and t@xmath17=jd 2446160@xmath1829 ( 1985.26@xmath180.08 ) ) .",
    "the system formed dust for about four months , 4% of the period , during periastron passage .",
    "this is perhaps one of the least well understood of the phenomena shown by wr 140 .",
    "the most recent periastron passage and dust - formation episode occurred in early 2001 , for which a multi - wavelength observing campaign was planned and undertaken .",
    "marchenko et al . ( 2003 ) carried out optical photometric and spectroscopic observations and derived a spectroscopic period @xmath19 days , in excellent agreement with the photometric period and new orbital elements , @xmath20=0.881@xmath180.005 , @xmath14=46.7@xmath151.6@xmath16 and t@xmath17=jd 2446147.4@xmath183.7 , which we use in this paper .",
    "they found that at phases very close to periastron , the profiles of the 5696@xmath21ciii and 5876@xmath21hei lines developed extra emission components at their ` blue ' ends which rapidly moved to the red .",

    "july , the optical light almost reached the pre - eclipse level .",
    "they interpreted this eclipse - like phenomenon as due to the carbon dust envelope , the formation of which was triggered at the periastron passage .",
    "the difference in the rising part of the eclipse light curves of 1993 and 2001 could be due to the differences in clumping in the expanding dust shell from cycle to cycle .",
    "aperture masking interferometric observations by monnier , tuthill & danchi ( 2002 ) using the keck telescope showed the first direct images of dust in wr 140 .",

    "[ wr140jmk ] , the slope of the continuum of the @xmath26 spectrum taken in 2001 march 31 is much flatter than that taken on january 2 . by the time of the 2003 may observation ,",
    "when the light curves predict that the dust emission contribution to the total flux had fallen to 10 per cent in the @xmath28 band and below 5 per cent in @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands owing to the cooling of the dust , the slope in the @xmath26 region had returned to that before dust formation .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 spectra show the change in continuum caused by variable amount of dilution due to emission from the dust .",
    "the @xmath38 region shows a nearly flat spectrum during 2001 april when the dust emission was at maximum at these wavelengths , and the spectra became steeper when the dust became cooler .",

    "the mass - loss rate for the o star ( @xmath61 ) was adopted from average values ( prinja et al . ) while that of the wc star @xmath62 was derived from the 5-ghz flux density at radio minimum , with allowance for the contribution from the wind of the o star .",
    "we can not rule out a @xmath25 three - fold higher mass - loss rate for the o star but note that the value adopted by w90 is supported by recent determinations ( @xmath63 for the o4  v((f * ) ) star hd 303308 and @xmath64 for the o5",

    "we therefore believe that the wc star s mass - loss rate was overestimated because its wind is clumped . a clumped wind with a volume filling factor @xmath65 ( dessart et al .",
    "2000 ) would have mass - loss rate a factor @xmath66 lower , yielding @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is consistent with the limits set by our hei observations , and will be adopted here .",
    "the hei line at 1.083 @xmath1 m is a very good tracer of colliding - wind phenomena in massive binaries ( stevens & howarth 1999 ) .",

    "re - observation of wr 140 with ukirt on 1991 october 19 ( @xmath70 = 0.83 ) confirmed the absence of structure on the flat top of the 1.083-@xmath1 m line profile . yet , by @xmath70 = 0.96 , the phase of our first high - resolution ( @xmath71 ) ukirt observation , a conspicuous sub - peak had appeared at the short - wavelength end of the profile ( fig .",

    "we interpret the appearance of this new emission feature in the intervening @xmath72 as evidence of increased interaction of the wc and o type winds as the stars moved closer to each other in their orbit . between phases 0.83 and 0.96 ,",
    "the separation of the stars decreased from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , so that the density of undisturbed winds having an @xmath75 density distribution would have increased by a factor of @xmath76 .",

    "marchenko et al . found that the strengths of the structures on the 5696-  ciii and 5896  hei lines varied with separation of the binary components more steeply than the @xmath4 dependency expected .",
    "we have fewer measurements , but it seems that the 1.083-@xmath1 m behave similarly . as noted above , the flux in the sub - peak increased by a factor @xmath79 between our 2000 october and december observations while the reciprocal separation , @xmath49 , increased by a factor of 2.05 . these spectra",

    "but it seems that the flux in the sub - peak is stronger still in 2001 march .",
    "the movement of the sub - peak is readily understood , qualitatively at least , in terms of the changing orientation of the wind - collision zone with orbital motion , especially around the time of periastron passage .",

    "this becomes analogous to the thin shell model of lhrs ( 1997 ) and hill , moffat & st - louis ( 2002 ) except that , instead of solving for the cone angle and flow velocity , we will adopt the value of @xmath53 derived above and determine the flow velocity following cant et al . ( eqn 29 ) from the terminal velocities of the wc and o stars ( 2860 km s@xmath10 and 3100 km s@xmath10 respectively",

    "[ model ] , where the models are compared with the observed velocities of the centre and extent measured from our high - resolution ukirt spectra .",
    "the agreement is very encouraging : the simple models successfully explains the movement of the centre of the line and reasonably approximate its width . from comparision with the october observation , we suggest that the orbital inclination is close to @xmath91 .",
    "the discrepanicies at the blue edges of the pre - eclipse sub - peaks are expected since we are not able to measure accurately the ` real ' blue edge of the sub - peak before the periastron passage since it overlaps the steep , p - cygni absorbed , region of the profile , which also results in an under - estimation of the flux in the subpeak during these phases .",
    "given the uncertainties , we have not attempted a formal solution for inclination .",

    "[ thetalim ] ) .",
    "the flux in the sub - peak ( table [ velocity ] ) on the hei profile is a significant source of cooling for the shock - heated material , exceeding the 26 kev x - ray flux ( @xmath92 wm@xmath52 ) observed with exosat near the time of the 1985 periastron passage ( w90 ) or the 110 kev flux ( @xmath93 wm@xmath52 ) observed with asca by koyama et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in 1993 june , shortly after the following periastron passage .",
    "koyama et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also noted that their x - ray flux was not significantly different from that observed with ginga in 1987 ( koyama et al .",
    "1990 ) , at a phase when the orbital separation was @xmath94 times that of their 1993 observation .",
    "they pointed out that this , and the exosat results , showed no convincing evidence that the x - ray flux above 2 kev , which should be relatively unaffected by interstellar or orbitally modulated circumstellar extinction , varied systematically with orbital separation .",
    "this was in contrast to the @xmath4-dependence expected theoretically for the x - ray luminosity of wr140 ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) , on the basis that the shocked winds were close to adiabatic because the cooling time of the shocked x - ray emitting material was long compared with the characteristic flow time .",
    "this discrepancy was studied further with additional asca data by zhekov & skinner ( 2000 ) and pollock , corcoran & stevens ( 2002 ) . both studies sought to adjust the orbital elements of wr 140 derived by w90 to recover the @xmath4-dependence for the x - ray fluxes , either reducing the eccentricity to @xmath95 or bringing forward t@xmath96 by 0.025p ( 72 days ) .",

    ", we see that the sub - peak remained blue shifted until 2001 january 2 and had moved to the red end of the profile by march 18 .",
    "if we are correct in interpreting this movement as a change of the orientation of the wind - collision region moving with the stars in their orbits , then quadrature and periastron passage must have occurred after january 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions of t@xmath96 of 2001 february 20 ( w90 ) or february 6 ( from elements by marchenko et al . ) but rules out the 72-day shift to december 10 proposed by zhekov & skinner .",
    "( setia gunawan et al . also proposed moving t@xmath96 forward , by 104 days .",
    "relative to the elements of w90 , but with a relatively large uncertainty , 117 days , which does not constrain our solution . )",
    "we propose instead that the x - ray flux departs from a @xmath4-dependence because the shocked wc wind is not totally adiabatic during periastron passage as a consequence of significant additional cooling in the hei sub - peak .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of wr 140 during and after its 2001 periastron passage showed dilution of the emission lines consistent with the formation of circumstellar dust between 2001 january 3 and march 26 , phases 0.989 and 0.017 .",
    "the hei 1.083-@xmath1 m line showed a strong p - cygni profile .",
    "variation of the strength of the absorption component measured from high - resolution spectra was interpreted in terms of the passage of different parts of the colliding wind structure in our line of sight to the two stars .",
    "this allowed us to set fairly tight limits on the opening half angle of the ` cone ' modelling the interaction region : @xmath99 .",
    "this , in turn , indicated a wind - momentum ratio @xmath67 , signifcantly higher than the @xmath100 found from the mass - loss rates and terminal velocities of the wc7 and o components .",
    "we suggested that the mass - loss rate of the wc7 star , @xmath62 derived from the 5-ghz flux density at radio minimum was overestimated because the wind is clumped .    at phases ( @xmath101 ) close to periastron passage ,",
    "the normally flat - topped emission component of the 1.083-@xmath1 m line showed the appearance of a sub - peak which moved from the blue to the red end of the profile during periastron .",
    "the evolution of the position and width of the sub - peak were found to be reasonably conistent with the flow of the emitting material along the surface of the interaction region modelled by a cone having @xmath68 .",
    "the maximum radiative flux in the sub - peaks is greater than the 110 kev x - ray flux at periastron and is a significant source of cooling of the shocked wc wind .",
    "we suggest that the shocked wc wind is not totally adiabatic near periastron , thereby accounting for the departure of the x - ray flux from the previously expected @xmath4-dependence and , as suggested by marchenko et al . , allowing dust formation .",
