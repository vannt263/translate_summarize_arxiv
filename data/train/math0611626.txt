    "the study of links and knots in spatial graphs began with conway and gordon s seminal result that every embedding of @xmath2 contains a non - trivial link and every embedding of @xmath1 contains a non - trivial knot @xcite .",
    "their result sparked considerable interest in _ intrinsically linked _ and _ intrinsically knotted _",
    "graphs with the property that every embedding in @xmath3 contains a pair of linked cycles ( respectively , a knotted cycle ) .",
    "robertson , seymour and thomas @xcite gave a kuratowski - type classification of intrinsically linked graphs , showing that every such graph contains one of the graphs in the _",
    "petersen family _ as a minor ( see figure  [ f : petersen ] ) .",
    "[ h ] @xmath4    however , while their result answers the question of _ which _ graphs are intrinsically linked , it does not address _ how _ they are linked , and how complicated the linking must be . in this paper , we measure the  complexity \" of a graph ( with respect to intrinsic linking ) by the minimal number of links in any embedding of the graph ( denoted @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is not the only possible measure of complexity . rather than counting the number of links",
    ", one could focus instead on the complexity of the individual links .",
    "flapan @xcite has given examples of graphs which must contain links with large linking numbers , and flapan et al .",
    "@xcite constructed graphs whose embeddings must contains links with many components .",
    "recently , the second author , with flapan and naimi , has generalized these results to show that there are graphs whose embedding must contain a link with arbitrarily complex _ linking patterns _ @xcite .    in other work , the authors have used the notion of _ virtual spatial graphs _ to form a filtration of graphs based on the presence of virtual links in a graph s virtual diagrams .",
    "these various measures of complexity are quite different ; for example , while all the graphs in the petersen family have @xmath6 , in the virtual filtration they fall into two distinct levels . while both @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be embedded with only hopf links , @xmath7 while we will show that @xmath8 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to count the minimal number of links in small ( 7 or 8 vertices ) complete @xmath0-partite graphs .",
    "we obtain complete results for graphs on 7 vertices , and upper and lower bounds for @xmath5 for graphs on 8 vertices ( see table [ ta : results ] ) . in the final sections ,",

    "so @xmath360 , realized by the fan embedding .",

    "the number of links is increasing very rapidly , so computer calculations quickly become infeasible .",

    "book embeddings , and particularly minimal book embeddings , minimize the entanglement among the edges of the graph ( for example , a book embedding of a graph can not contain any local knots along the edges ) .",
    "so it is reasonable to think that minimal book embeddings will also minimize the linking or knotting in an embedding .",
    "otsuki @xcite gave the first results along these lines .",
    "since conway and gordon @xcite showed that every embedding of @xmath2 contains a pair of linked triangles , and every embedding of @xmath1 contains a knotted 7-cycle , it is immediate that every embedding of @xmath375 contains at least @xmath376 pairs of linked triangles , and @xmath377 knotted 7-cycles .",
    "otsuki constructed a particular minimal book embedding of @xmath375 called the _ canonical book representation _ , which has the property that removing any vertex gives a canonical book representation of @xmath378 .",

    "therefore , each such subgraph contains 14 triangle - square links , and the embedding of @xmath375 contains @xmath379 triangle - square links . by theorem [ t : k7 ] , this is minimal .",
    "we can also look at a canonical book representation for @xmath56 , as shown in figure  [ f : k8canonical ] .",
    "we can compute that this embedding contains exactly 305 links ",
    "28 triangle - triangle links , 112 triangle - square links , 112 triangle - pentagon links and 53 square - square links .",
    "this is the same total number of links as the embedding shown in figure [ f:8vertex2 ] , which leads us to conjecture :      however , notice that the embeddings of @xmath56 in figures [ f:8vertex2 ] and [ f : k8canonical ] , while they have the same total number of links , do _ not _ have the same number of links of each type ; so an embedding which minimizes the total number of links may not minimize the number of links of each type .",
    "given integers @xmath0 and @xmath336 , is there an embedding of @xmath375 ( @xmath381 ) which minimizes both the total number of links and the number of links between a @xmath0-cycle and an @xmath336-cycle ?",
    "our discussion of complete bipartite graphs in section [ s : bipartite ] also provides some evidence in favor of conjecture [ c : minimal ] .",
    "the fan embeddings discussed there are easily seen to be book embeddings , although not minimal ( the fan embedding of @xmath362 has a pagenumber of @xmath9 , while enomoto et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the pagenumber is at most @xmath382 ) .",
    "so once again , it seems reasonable to focus on book embeddings , and if possible on minimal book embeddings , when trying to minimize the total number of links in a graph embedding .",
    "there are also issues about the interplay between different measures of the complexity of the linking in a graph embedding .",
    "for example , while the embeddings of @xmath56 in figures [ f:8vertex2 ] and [ f : k8canonical ] each have 305 links ( the smallest number we have found ) , they also each contain a link with linking number 2 . on the other hand",
    ", there is an embedding with only hopf links ( all links have linking number @xmath383 ) , shown in figure  [ f : k8hopf ] , but this embedding contains 330 links .",
