    "the fact that the top quark is much heavier than the other quarks , @xmath11 gev @xcite , is suggestive of a new dynamics at the electroweak scale , where the third generation may be playing a special role .",
    "in particular , effective four - fermion interactions @xcite can lead to the formation of quark - antiquark bound states which in turn can dynamically trigger the breaking of the electroweak symmetry @xcite . this is the basic idea of top - quark condensation as well as of technicolor models , i.e. the higgs sector of the standard model is just an effective ginzburg - landau - type description of low - energy physics represented by a composite isodoublet scalar field ( or fields ) @xcite .    in the above framework ,",
    "a particularly interesting scenario is provided by models where the top quark mass arises mostly from a @xmath12 condensate , generated by a new strong dynamics , plus a small fundamental component , generated by an extended technicolor or higgs sector @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such a structure for the top quark mass avoids the problems usually found in pure ( minimal ) top - quark condensation scenarios , which assume that the @xmath13 condensate is fully responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , thus leading to a too large @xmath14 value ( @xmath15 gev ) and a very large scale for the new dynamics ( @xmath16 gev ) with significant fine tuning .    along this line",
    ", a dynamical scheme was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is assumed that the third generation of quarks does indeed experience new forces , symmetric in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and that these new forces also generate a strong @xmath1 phase @xmath0 .",
    "it is then possible to show that , in such a scenario , the @xmath0 term triggers the breaking of the symmetry between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and induces a large @xmath1-violating phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , due to the smallness of the @xmath19 mass ratio @xcite . in this model one expects to have a richer low - energy phenomenology when compared to the standard model ( sm ) , which could lead to potentially interesting effects , specially in @xmath2 and @xmath3 physics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the low - energy phenomenological implications of the model proposed in @xcite and , in particular , its implications for @xmath2 and @xmath3 physics .",
    "we will show that new observable effects arise due to the fact that the third generation of quarks experiences new strong forces which in turn lead to scalar flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions at tree level .",
    "these fcnc interactions result from the fact that both the up and down quark mass matrices receive contributions not only from yukawa interactions with the standard higgs but also from interactions involving the third generation quark - antiquark bound states .",
    "the present and near future experiments at @xmath3 factories and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will certainly improve the bounds on many of the @xmath1-violating and flavour - changing processes , which are forbidden or strongly suppressed in the sm .",
    "therefore it is particularly interesting to determine possible experimental signatures in models involving new fcnc physics .",
    "in this section we shall briefly present the main features and physical consequences of the model in question . a more complete and detailed analysis",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a standard model higgs sector in combination with an effective new strong interaction acting on the third generation of quarks and characterized by a @xmath0 term .",
    "we require that this new strong interaction conserves the isospin symmetry between @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks .",
    "moreover , if one assumes that the electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections due to top - quark ( and possibly , bottom - quark ) loops , the quartic self - interactions of the higgs field may be neglected . in this case , the relevant classical lagrangian for the fundamental scalar field @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the yukawa couplings and @xmath27 is the usual covariant derivative of the sm .",
    "next one assumes that the interactions acting on the members of the third generation of quarks are strong enough to form quark - antiquark bound states at the electroweak scale .",
    "the latter can be described in terms of two complex doublet scalar fields @xmath28 and the corresponding effective lagrangian then reads : @xmath29    the effects of a new strong @xmath1 phase @xmath0 can , in principle , be described through an arbitrary function of @xmath30 , where @xmath31    in analogy with qcd @xmath32 we shall assume the lagrangian form . ]",
    "^{2 } ,   \\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] which typically arises as a leading term in a @xmath34 - expansion .",
    "the total effective lagrangian of the model is then given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined by eqs.([eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) , respectively . notice that if @xmath38 the lagrangian ( [ eq:6 ] ) conserves an `` isospin '' symmetry .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the angle @xmath0 provides a dynamical origin for both @xmath1 violation and isospin breaking , once the neutral components of the three doublets @xmath20 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) .",
    "denoting the vev s of the neutral components of the fields by @xmath41 the effective potential reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some effective quadratic and quartic couplings , respectively .",
    "all couplings and parameters in the potential are assumed to be real and positive .",
    "the minimization of the potential implies the following system of equations : @xmath46 where @xmath47 the mass parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 are chosen such that the quantities @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 defined in eqs.([eq:11 ] ) are always positive .",
    "if the parameter @xmath53 is large , @xmath54 , then the last equation in ( [ eq:10 ] ) implies the constraint @xmath55 furthermore , if @xmath56 , it is easy to show that @xmath57 is the only solution of the equations and therefore @xmath1 is conserved .",
    "a simple analytical solution can be given for the isospin symmetric case @xmath58 and assuming @xmath59 .",
    "in this case @xmath60 and therefore @xmath61 .",
    "clearly the large splitting between the physical values of the bottom and top masses ( @xmath62 ) requires @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 , which in turn demands that the @xmath1-violating phase @xmath0 be close to @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , the presence of a phase @xmath0 close to @xmath65 induces both isospin breaking and @xmath1 violation with    @xmath66    the actual values of the vev s can be determined from the physical values of the masses @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for small values of @xmath69 , i.e @xmath70",
    ", one has the simple expressions @xmath71 where @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 is the fermi coupling constant .    the mass spectra of the neutral and charged ( pseudo ) scalars are easily found . in the neutral sector , it is straightforward to find the linear combination corresponding to the goldstone boson eaten up by the @xmath74 gauge boson . for @xmath53 very large , one of the eigenvalues of the mass matrix will be proportional to @xmath75 and therefore the corresponding linear combination of the fields will decouple from the theory .",
    "the remaining @xmath76 mass matrix can be easily diagonalized .",
    "one finds that the standard higgs scalar @xmath77 has a mass given by @xmath78 , two of the remaining masses are proportional to @xmath79 and thus are quite large .",
    "finally the mass which corresponds mainly to a @xmath80 bound state is very sensitive to the difference @xmath81 , but as soon as @xmath25 and @xmath26 differ ( as expected from higher order corrections ) it will also get a contribution proportional to @xmath82 . in the charged sector one of the eigenstates is eaten up by the @xmath83 gauge boson through the usual higgs mechanism . for the isospin symmetric case @xmath84",
    ", we find that one of the charged higgs masses is very small , i.e. a new pseudo - goldstone boson appears as it happens in the neutral sector .",
    "nevertheless , radiative corrections yield @xmath85 and therefore this mass will get a large contribution proportional to @xmath82 .    to conclude this section let us comment on the origin of @xmath1 violation in the present model . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the new interaction characterized by a @xmath86 term induces a @xmath1-violating effect which filters down to the sm only if @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , this new source of @xmath1 violation can be in principle responsible for what is observed in the @xmath88 system , since it leads indeed to a sizeable @xmath1-violating phase in the ckm matrix , @xmath89 .",
    "in general , the presence of more than one higgs doublet in the sm leads to fcnc interactions at the tree level , which are mediated by the physical neutral scalars .",
    "such interactions are severely constrained by the smallness not only of the @xmath1-violating parameter @xmath90 but also of the @xmath88 and @xmath91 mixing .",
    "the model we are considering is effectively equivalent to a three higgs doublet model with a specific structure for yukawa couplings .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to determine the form of the induced fcnc interactions by generalizing the results obtained in the two higgs doublet case @xcite .",
    "let us consider 3 higgs doublets @xmath92 and make the decomposition : @xmath93 where @xmath94 are real fields and @xmath95 denote the vev s of the higgs fields .",

    "the quark mass matrices are easily obtained , @xmath99 @xmath100 where the phase @xmath101 has been put equal to zero by an appropriate redefinition of the fields .    to single out the pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath102 we introduce the new fields @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath102 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 defined through the transformation @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 . in terms of the new fields , the scalar couplings to the down quarks can be written as @xmath111    we notice that the couplings to the fields @xmath112 and @xmath106 are flavour - conserving while the couplings to @xmath113 and @xmath105 are flavour - violating .",
    "similarly , for the couplings to the up quarks one obtains @xmath114 and thus the couplings of @xmath115 conserve flavour while the couplings of @xmath116 do violate flavour .",
    "it is useful to obtain the scalar - quark couplings in terms of the quark mass eigenstates . in the down quark sector",
    "we find @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the up quark sector the couplings to the scalars in the quark mass eigenstate basis are given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 which can be rewritten as @xmath123    the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath124 have a very simple form in the present model , namely , @xmath125 and therefore the matrices @xmath126 defined in eqs.([gd ] ) and ( [ gu ] ) are given by    @xmath127    these matrices completely determine the structure of tree - level fcnc interactions in the model . without further assumptions we can not predict the size of such interactions .",
    "we shall assume that the quark mass matrices @xmath128 are hermitian can always be written as a product of a hermitian matrix and a unitary matrix .",
    "the latter can be rotated away by a redefinition of the right quark fields .",

    "are entirely predicted in terms of @xmath135 since from eq.([g2d ] ) we obtain    @xmath136    finally , new contributions to flavour - changing processes will be also induced by the couplings of the heavy charged higgs fields to the quarks .",
    "such contributions correspond to feynman box diagrams with @xmath83-boson and charged higgs particle exchanges . to determine the magnitude of these couplings ,",
    "let us introduce the new charged fields @xmath137 through the decomposition @xmath138 where the matrix @xmath139 is given by eq.([matrixo ] ) and @xmath140 corresponds to the pseudo - goldstone boson .",

    "it is clear that in order to analyze the charged higgs contributions to the relevant flavour - changing processes we need to know the structure of the unitary matrices @xmath147 . to be able to predict the size of such contributions",
