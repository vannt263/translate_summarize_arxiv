    "extragalactic radio sources are uniquely well suited to probe clustering on the largest scales : ( 1 ) radio surveys are unaffected by dust extinction which may introduce spurious features reflecting the inhomogeneous extinction due to galactic dust ; ( 2 ) due to their strong cosmological evolution , radio sources are very rare locally , so that radio samples are free from the profusion of local objects that dominate optically selected galaxy samples and tend to swamp very large - scale structures at cosmological distances ; ( 3 ) thanks to the strong cosmological evolution , even shallow radio surveys reach out to substantial redshifts . the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",

    "when a realistic redshift distribution of the nvss sources is adopted , the interpretation of the measured @xmath14 in the framework of the standard hierarchical clustering scenario with gaussian primordial perturbations requires an evolution of the bias factor radically different from that of optically selected qsos @xcite , in stark contrast with the similar evolution of the luminosity function .",

    "it is known to be robust and accurate for the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix but not as widely tested and calibrated for the off - diagonal ones , which can not be neglected because neighboring acf data points are highly correlated . from @xcite",
