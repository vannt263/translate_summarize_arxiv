    "since the qcd corrections to @xmath3 and @xmath4 production are very similar , they cancel almost perfectly in the @xmath3 to @xmath4 cross section ratio ; the @xmath115 corrections to @xmath277 are of @xmath288 or less , depending on the set of parton distribution functions used  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the electroweak corrections do in general not cancel in @xmath277 .",
    "as noted before , in @xmath289 both leptons can emit photons , whereas only the charged lepton radiates in @xmath5 decays .",
    "since final state photonic corrections are the dominating contribution to the @xmath24 ew corrections , the @xmath0 corrections to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections are quite different , and thus do not cancel in @xmath277 .",
    "for example , when lepton identification requirements are taken into account , the @xmath0 ew corrections in the electron ( muon ) case increase @xmath277 by @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) . note that , unlike the electroweak corrections , qcd corrections are only slightly modified by cuts and lepton identification requirements .    from the results shown in table  [ tab : two ]",
    "we conclude that it will be necessary to correct for higher order electroweak effects if one wishes to measure the @xmath3 cross section and @xmath277 with an accuracy of @xmath288 or better .",
    "uncertainties in the parton distribution functions are a major contribution to the systematic error of the @xmath3 mass extracted in hadron collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the charge asymmetry of leptons in @xmath3 decays  @xcite , @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the lepton rapidity and @xmath294 provides strong constraints on the ratio of @xmath295 and @xmath296 quark distributions  @xcite .",
    "these constraints considerably reduce the uncertainty originating from the parton distribution functions in the @xmath3 mass measurement  @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to know how electroweak radiative corrections affect @xmath297 .",
    "the @xmath25 asymmetry as a function of the lepton rapidity for @xmath298 ( dashed line ) and @xmath237 ( dotted line ) production is shown in fig .  [ fig : twelve ] together with the lowest order prediction ( solid line ) . except for the pseudo - rapidity cut on the charged lepton",
    ", we impose the cuts listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lepcut ] ) and  ( [ eq : ptmisscut ] ) in this subsection . since @xmath299 , the asymmetry is only displayed for @xmath300",
    ". the flavor specific lepton identification requirements of table  [ tab : one ] are not taken into account in fig .",
    "[ fig : twelve ] .",
    "the asymmetry in the born approximation for electron and muon final states is virtually indistinguishable for the cuts and the energy and momentum resolutions we use .",
    "electroweak corrections are seen to only slightly affect the charge asymmetry .    in order to display the effect of ew radiative corrections on @xmath297 more clearly , we show the difference between the @xmath301 and the born asymmetry in fig .",
    "[ fig : thirteen ] . without taking the lepton identification requirements of table  [ tab : one ] into account , the difference of the @xmath25 and the born asymmetry is positive and gradually increases with @xmath293 from zero at @xmath302 to about 0.01 for electrons , and approximately 0.005 for muons , at @xmath303 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : thirteen]a ) . figure  [ fig : thirteen]b displays the difference between the @xmath32 and the born charge asymmetry when the lepton identification requirements are included in the simulation . due to the recombination of the electron and photon momentum four vectors for small lepton ",
    "photon opening angles , the size of the electroweak corrections to the charge asymmetry in the electron case is drastically reduced when these requirements are taken into account . for @xmath304 ,",
    "the @xmath236 corrections reduce @xmath305 by a very small amount . in the forward rapidity region , @xmath306 , the difference of the @xmath32 and",
    "the born charge asymmetry is positive and slowly increases , reaching approximately 0.0025 at @xmath307 . for comparison , the statistical error in @xmath305 in this region expected for run  ii ( assuming @xmath308 ) is @xmath309  @xcite .",
    "the variation of the charge asymmetry due to the uncertainties of the present parton distribution functions is about 0.015  @xcite in the same region .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0 electroweak corrections for muons and electrons when lepton identification requirements are included is similar .",
    "however , in the muon case , the ew corrections enhance ( reduce ) the @xmath32 asymmetry at small ( large ) rapidities .",
    "the mass of the @xmath3 boson is one of the fundamental parameters of the sm and a precise measurement of @xmath9 is an important objective for current experiments at lep2 and future experiments at the tevatron .",
    "a precise measurement of the @xmath3 mass helps to constrain the higgs boson mass from radiative corrections .",
    "it will also provide restrictions on the parameters of the mssm . in order to perform such a measurement at a hadron collider , it is crucial to fully control higher order qcd and electroweak corrections . in this paper",
    "we have presented a calculation of the electroweak corrections to @xmath3 production in hadronic collisions which is based on the full set of contributing @xmath32 feynman diagrams .",
    "the @xmath0 electroweak corrections can be arranged into separately gauge invariant qed - like contributions corresponding to initial state , final state and interference corrections , and gauge invariant modified weak contributions to the @xmath3 production and decay processes .",
    "due to mass singular logarithmic terms associated with final state photon radiation in the limit where the photon is collinear with one of the leptons , final state radiation effects dominate .",
    "initial state corrections were found to be small after appropriately factorizing the corresponding collinear singularities into the parton distribution functions . however , currently no parton distribution functions which include qed corrections are available . with the factorization scheme used in this paper , the effect of the qed corrections on the pdf",
    "is expected to be small .",
    "we find that the part of the initial state corrections included in our calculation is uniform over the entire range of the @xmath34 transverse mass and the lepton @xmath36 range , and increases the differential cross section by about @xmath176 . likewise ,",
    "the modified weak corrections are uniform , but decrease the cross section by a similar amount . in contrast , the final state qed - like corrections modify the shape of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 distributions substantially .    without including the lepton identification requirements imposed by experiments , the effect of the electroweak corrections is larger in the electron channel than in the muon channel .",
    "when these requirements are taken into account , the mass singular logarithmic terms are eliminated in the electron case because the electron and photon momentum four vectors are combined for small opening angles where it is difficult to resolve the two particles .",
    "initial state qed - like , final state qed - like , modified weak and interference contributions are then all of similar size . on the other hand , in order to experimentally identify muons , the energy of the photon is required to be smaller than a critical value if the @xmath310 separation is small , and mass singular terms survive . removing energetic photons thus enhances the effect of the @xmath0 corrections , and the effect of the electroweak corrections in the muon case is larger than in the electron case once lepton identification requirements are included .    electroweak radiative corrections have a significant impact on the @xmath3 mass extracted from experiment .",
    "the main effect is caused by final state photon radiation and is corrected for in the @xmath3 mass analyses of the tevatron experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , in the calculation used by cdf and d  @xcite , the effect of the final state soft and virtual photonic corrections is estimated indirectly from the inclusive @xmath21 @xmath22 width and the hard photon bremsstrahlung contribution .",
    "initial state , interference , and weak contributions to the @xmath0 corrections are ignored altogether .",
    "the correct treatment of the final state soft and virtual photonic corrections significantly changes the slope of the transverse mass distribution in the region @xmath226 .",
    "this changes the @xmath3 mass extracted from the transverse mass distribution by @xmath311 , and might also have a non - negligible effect on the @xmath3 width measured from the tail of the @xmath35 distribution .",
    "more detailed numerical simulations are needed to quantitatively assess this effect .",
    "initial state , and initial  final state interference corrections , have only a small effect on the @xmath35 distribution and hence are expected to only marginally influence the amount the @xmath3 boson mass is shifted .",
    "our results demonstrate that , for the current level of precision , the approximate calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is adequate .",
    "the small difference in the @xmath3 boson mass obtained in the complete @xmath32 and the approximate calculation , however , can not be ignored if one attempts to measure the @xmath3 mass with high precision at hadron colliders .",
    "this also raises the question of how strongly multiple final state photon radiation influences the measured @xmath3 boson mass .",
    "so far , only partial calculations exist  @xcite .",
    "a more complete understanding of multiple photon radiation is warranted .    as an alternative to the transverse mass and the lepton @xmath36 distribution ,",
    "the @xmath3 to @xmath4 transverse mass ratio , @xmath261 , has been used recently to extract the mass of the @xmath3 boson .",
    "we found that , since the @xmath0 corrections to the @xmath4 boson transverse mass distribution are significantly larger than those to the @xmath3 @xmath35 distribution , electroweak corrections influence @xmath261 more strongly than the @xmath35 or @xmath212 distribution .",
    "finally , we studied how electroweak radiative corrections influence the @xmath3 cross section , the @xmath3 to @xmath4 cross section ratio , @xmath277 , and the charge asymmetry of leptons in @xmath3 decays , @xmath297 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : two ] , the @xmath0 electroweak corrections can reduce the @xmath3 cross section by up to @xmath229 in the presence of cuts .",
    "the size of the @xmath0 electroweak corrections is of the same order as the nnlo qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections were found to enhance @xmath277 by up to @xmath291 .",
    "qcd corrections , on the other hand , cancel almost perfectly in the @xmath3 to @xmath4 cross section ratio and are of @xmath288 .",
    "the @xmath0 electroweak corrections to @xmath297 may not be negligible in view of the projected accuracy of the charge asymmetry in future tevatron runs",
