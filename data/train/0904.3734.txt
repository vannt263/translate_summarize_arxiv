    "-55.8  mv).,width=325 ]    the oxidation of the ag(111 ) surface is a fascinating example of how a seemingly simple system can escape a detailed understanding for decades , in spite of repeated and thorough efforts .",
    "the history of surface science investigations of the oxidation of ag(111 ) , briefly reviewed recently,@xcite started back in the sixties and early seventies with a couple of single crystal studies@xcite and took a serious upswing with the investigations by rovida _",
    "_ in the seventies,@xcite who , in particular , reported on the now renowned @xmath0 phase . in the following much of the effort",
    "was directed towards this phase,@xcite but also numerous other studies of more general character appeared,@xcite as well as works concerned with the reactivity of o / ag(111 ) towards , in particular , the oxidation of ethene and methanol . @xcite",
    "only recently the atomic - scale geometric model for the @xmath6 phase was completely revised on the basis of a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) , surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) , and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) experiments and density functional theory calculations.@xcite subsequent , detailed low - energy electron diffraction and co reaction studies supported this atomic model.@xcite at the same time an increasing number of studies have indicated that the phase diagram of the oxidized ag(111 ) surface is more complex than previously anticipated . while earlier studies only stipulated the existence of the @xmath0 and an atomic adsorbate layer ( including a phase with a local @xmath7r@xmath8 symmetry ) ,",
    "recent studies have reported phases containing both less@xcite , equally much,@xcite and more@xcite oxygen than the @xmath0 phase ( cf .",
    "table  [ tableconditions ] ) .",
    "many of the reactivity studies have assumed that the catalytical properties of ag are associated with the @xmath0 structure due to the anticipation that this phase should be predominant under oxygen pressures similar to those under reaction conditions.@xcite these investigations have in general not taken into account the existence of further phases and , hence , a much more complex phase diagram for the ag - o system will fundamentally change our picture of what happens in the catalytic process . at present",
    ", growing evidence exists that the static phases found in surface science studies may neither be responsible for the surface s catalytic activity itself nor be preserved during catalytic operation.@xcite the surface is rather to be considered as a dynamic medium , the structure of which changes in response to the changing chemical environment .",
    "the formation and breakup of these static ag - o phases are still of significant interest due to the phases role in the overall dynamics of the catalytic process .",
    "thus surface science studies with their unprecedented ability of clarifying the atomic - scale structure still retain their value and validity .    here",
    "we present a detailed and thorough experimental and theoretical study of oxygen adsorption on ag(111 ) , with data concerning both previously observed structures and hitherto new unobserved phases of oxidized ag(111 ) .",
    "the present study shows that the @xmath0 phase is embedded in a wider context of two additional phases , the @xmath9rect and @xmath10rect structures .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath11 structure , to our knowledge in contrast to the @xmath12rect and @xmath13rect phases , can host foreign atoms and molecules . finally , the existence of two more phases with a @xmath3 and `` stripe '' character is reported .",
    "the experiments were carried out in the stm laboratory and at the vacuum ultraviolet / soft x - ray synchrotron radiation facility astrid at aarhus university . in the stm laboratory we used an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber with a base pressure of @xmath14 torr , equipped with standard instrumentation for sample cleaning",
    ", the aarhus stm,@xcite a low - energy electron diffractometer , and a thermal gas cracker from oxford instruments for atomic oxygen exposure with a cracking efficiency which in our experiments varied from 30% at @xmath15 to 14% at @xmath16 torr total pressure .",
    "directly connected to the uhv chamber is a small and compact high pressure cell which makes it possible to dose molecular oxygen at pressures up to one atmosphere . after oxygen exposure",
    "the sample was characterized by stm and , in some cases , low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "the transfer between the high pressure cell and the uhv chamber could be accomplished within less than 15 min of oxygen exposure .",
    "most of the stm experiments were performed at room temperature , although some of the stm images were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature , which sometimes resulted in higher spatial resolution .    for the xps measurements the surfaces were prepared and initially characterized in the stm chamber and then brought to the sx-700 beamline@xcite of astrid in a vacuum suitcase with a base pressure better than @xmath17 torr .",
    "the pressure during transfer from the vacuum chambers to the suitcase , which could be accomplished within a minute , rose to in between @xmath18 and @xmath19 torr .",
    "the base pressure of the uhv chamber of the sx-700 beamline is @xmath20 torr .",
    "after the xps measurement the sample was transferred back to the stm chamber and the status of the sample reinvestigated by stm .",
    "the control experiments ensured that the examined structures were still present and clearly visible in the stm , although some minor deterioration of the surface might have occurred .",
    "the ag(111 ) surface was cleaned by repeated sputter / annealing cycles . it was then oxidized by exposing it to either atomic oxygen at partial atomic oxygen pressures of @xmath17 to @xmath21 torr or molecular oxygen at pressures between 0.5 and 10  torr . during oxygen exposure the ag(111 ) sample was held at temperatures in between 420 and 600  k for an exposure time of 10 to 50  min . following this recipe , the structure of the oxidized surface varied with oxygen pressure , sample temperature , and exposure time . as discussed below",
    ", the prepared surface typically exhibited co - existing domains of different surface phases .",
    "however , it was possible to prepare single phase surfaces for some of the structures presented below by carefully tuning the preparation parameters .",
    "bare _ et al._,@xcite have proposed an alternative preparation procedure , in which the surface is exposed to no@xmath22 at pressures between @xmath5 to @xmath23  torr , while the sample is kept at the same temperatures as described above .",
    "this method has also been used in a variety of subsequent studies.@xcite here we do not present any results obtained on samples prepared by this no@xmath22 method , although we did carry out a limited number of such studies .",
    "consistent with carlisle _",
    "et al._,@xcite we were able to produce the atomic oxygen , @xmath13rect - o , and @xmath0-o phases in these studies , which indicates that the use of no@xmath22 instead of atomic or molecular oxygen does not significantly change the picture drawn up here .",
    "all the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations reported here were carried out with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation@xcite in periodic supercells within the plane - wave pseudopotential formalism as implemented in the castep code.@xcite as discussed below , a variety of unit cells were used , all consisting of five layer ag(111 ) slabs and with fine monkhorst - pack _ * k*_-point meshes equivalent to at least 24@xmath2424@xmath241 per ( 1@xmath241 ) surface unit cell . during structure optimizations",
    "the top layer of ag atoms as well as the oxide overlayer atoms were allowed to relax , whilst the bottom four layers of ag were held fixed . from the dft results simulated stm images",
    "were obtained using the simple tersoff - hamann approximation.@xcite a `` tip '' height of 2.5   above the highest atom in each overlayer for occupied states within 2 ev of the fermi level was used .",
    "figure  [ figallstructures ] displays stm images of all the phases which we have observed experimentally . the symmetry assignments ( @xmath9rect , @xmath25rect , and @xmath3 for the hitherto non - assigned phases",
    "; see below for a more detailed description ) were derived on the basis of the stm results .",
    "the middle parts of the panels represent the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the stm images , while the right - hand parts reproduce leed simulations obtained from the symmetry assignments provided on the basis of the stm observations .",
    "these leed results are in excellent agreement with the ffts , which lends further credibility to the stm - based symmetry assignments for the oxygen - induced phases .    at the lowest oxygen coverages an apparently disordered arrangement of depressions",
    "is observed in the constant current stm images ( fig .",
    "[ figallstructures](a ) ) .",
    "the depressions are interpreted as atomic oxygen adsorbates , consistent with previous studies@xcite and the well - known fact that oxygen depletes the local density of states at the fermi level , leading to a depression - like appearance of atomic oxygen on metal surfaces.@xcite domains of this disordered structure are also frequently observed to co - exist with domains of the structures shown in figs .",

    "as shown in panel ( a ) , at the lowest biases of approximately @xmath26  mev the stm image exhibits the typical honeycomb appearance with the structural voids displayed as depressions ( cf . the atomic model in fig .  [ figbuildingblockstructures](b ) ) .",
    "when the bias is increased to about @xmath27  mv a fraction of the voids appears filled ( panel ( b ) ) . at the highest biases used , around @xmath28  mv , the fillings already visible at the intermediate bias are now the brightest features in the stm image , while other voids display fillings with a smaller apparent height in the image [ panel ( c ) ] .",
    "only a very minor fraction of voids seem to be unfilled .",
    "we frequently observed the presence of fillings in the voids of the @xmath0 structure ; indeed , it is likely that they are an inherent feature of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "the fillings are most easily imaged at elevated biases of both tunneling polarities . at low biases they normally remain unobserved , and , thus ,",
    "their absence in stm images recorded at low biases does not imply their absence from the surface .",
    "the fillings occur in preparations from both atomic and molecular oxygen , but we can not clarify here whether they exist for preparations from no@xmath22 , as well .",
    "interestingly , we have not seen any such filling for the @xmath13rect phase , although it  in contrast to the @xmath9rect structure  contains the same kind of voids as visible from the structural models in fig .",
    "[ figbuildingblockstructures ] .",
    "we suggest that the fillings are related to adsorbate species in the voids of the @xmath0 phase . since we observed such fillings both directly after preparation of the surface by either atomic or molecular oxygen as well as after measurements for a time span of several hours",
    ", it seems unlikely that rest gas contamination can be made responsible for the fillings .",
    "nonetheless , at present we can not specify the chemical nature of the fillings and we can just note that the observation of the fillings suggests an interesting host - guest character of the @xmath0 phase , which would deserve a more systematic study .",
    "finally we would like to discuss two additional structures not observed previously .",
    "these are the @xmath3 and stripe phases of figure  [ figallstructures](e - f ) . in both cases",
    "it is difficult to provide the exact details of the atomic scale structures .",
    "the reasons are that for the @xmath3 structure we have so far not been able to find a recipe for preparing a single phase @xmath3 surface , and for the stripe structure there exists a larger manifold of similar , co - existing structures .",
    "the difficulty in preparing surfaces covered by a single coherent structure have prevented the use of averaging techniques such as leed , which would have resulted in useful additional information . in the following we therefore limit ourselves to primarily describing the characteristics of the structures to the extent",
    "they could be extracted from the stm data .",

    "such a comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ figc4x8](a ) .",
    "the correctness of the assignment is supported by the good agreement between the fft of the stm image and the leed simulation based on the @xmath3 unit cell in figure  [ figallstructures](e ) .",
    "since oxygen typically is invisible in the stm images it is assumed that the bright features in the more highly resolved stm images of the @xmath33 structure correspond to silver atoms , cf .",
    "[ figc4x8](b ) .",
    "this assignment leads us to suggest the tentative top layer ag atom geometry depicted in fig .",
    "[ figc4x8](c ) .",
    "it is the only geometry for which the bright features in the experimental image can be brought into coincidence with lattice sites . in this model ,",
    "20% of the top layer silver atoms reside in bridging sites , while the remaining silver atoms are found in both hcp and fcc hollow sites .    the ring - formed depressions around the ag atoms in bridging sites indicate that the ag atoms are surrounded by oxygen atoms .",
    "the placement of four oxygen atoms in the dark ring leads to the detailed geometry shown in figure  [ figc4x8](d ) . in this geometry",
    "the coordination of the silver atoms by other top layer silver atoms is much lower than in the building block structures described in section [ secbuildingblockstructures ] . in these structures silver atoms with a low silver coordination such as the corner atoms of the ag@xmath1/ag@xmath2 triangles",
    "were imaged with a reduced apparent height as compared to the fully silver - coordinated silver atoms in the centers of the triangles .",
    "as seen clearly in figure  [ figc4x8](a ) , also the @xmath33 phase is characterized by a much smaller apparent height than the brightest features of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "we take this as an indication that the @xmath3 structure indeed is more highly oxidized than any of the building block structures .",
    "the suggested structure for the @xmath3 phase possesses a ag@xmath34o@xmath35 ( ag@xmath22o@xmath36 ) stoichiometry ( cf .",
    "table  [ tablestoichiometrydensity ] ) .",
    "a very similar structure was observed previously for a pd@xmath34o@xmath35 surface oxide.@xcite a major difference between the present and the pd oxide case is , however , the full commensurability of the ag@xmath34o@xmath35 unit cell , while the pd@xmath34o@xmath35 is incommensurate in one surface direction .",
    "it is seen that the proposed stoichiometry for the @xmath3 is more reminiscent of ago than ag@xmath22o and that the density of ag and o atoms is much lower in the @xmath3 as compared to the ag@xmath1/ag@xmath2 building block structures .",
    "this difference in stoichiometry and ag and o densities in comparison to the @xmath0 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 phases is surprising in view of the coexistence of these structures such as those in figure  [ figstructuresatthesametime ] . at present",

    ", we would first like to again emphasize that there exists a larger number of co - existing structures which appear as stripes in the stm measurements .",
    "probably these structures have similar , but not exactly equal atomic geometries . that the geometries indeed differ between different domains of the stripe phase",
    "is quite obvious from a comparison of the displayed domains in figs .",
    "[ figallstructures](f ) and [ figstripes ] .",
    "the common denominator of the domains is the occurrence of stripes along \\{1@xmath400 } , but the arrangement and apparent height of the stripes are not always the same .",
    "while it was difficult in general to obtain high resolution stm images on extended domains of stripe character , this was sometimes possible on smaller domains embedded in other structures .",
    "figure  [ figstripes ] provides examples of such high - resolution stm images .",
    "we tentatively assume that the protruding features of these images are silver atoms . along",
    "the \\{1@xmath400 } directions the distance between these features corresponds to the ag(111 ) nearest - neighbor distance @xmath41   . in the perpendicular direction the distances of the rows",
    "is , however , not a multiple of @xmath42 , as might have been expected . by comparison to the surrounding surface covered by domains of the @xmath0 , @xmath9rect , and @xmath25rect phases",
    "it is estimated that the repetitive unit rather comprises four stripes and that this unit has a width of @xmath43 .",
    "in such a unit cell it is not possible to place all the silver atoms in the same lattice site .",
    "the differing brightness of adjacent stripes supports this conclusion .",
    "the position of the oxygen atoms in the stripe phase can not be specified in any detail from an analysis of the stm results .",
    "it seems likely that oxygen atoms reside in between the bright stripes .",
    "the xps data in figure  [ figo1s ] indicate that the oxygen content is considerably higher than in the @xmath0 and @xmath9rect phases .",
    "similar to the @xmath44 structure and the corner atoms of the triangles in the building block structures , the stripes are imaged at a smaller apparent height compared to that of the adjacent domains of primarily @xmath9rect symmetry in panel ( a ) of figure  [ figstripes ] and primarily @xmath0 in panel ( b ) .",
    "this suggests that the silver coordination of the ag atoms of the stripe phase is smaller than that of the ag atoms in the centers of the triangles of the building block structures , which indicates a higher oxygen coordination and thus a higher oxygen content of the stripe phase .",
    "however , at present , we refrain from a more quantitative analysis , partly since it is unclear to what extent the xps data represent fully covered surfaces and partly since the stm data can not provide any more detailed information .",
    "it is noted , though , that metal / oxygen structure with quite a high oxygen content and exhibiting a stripe appearance have been observed on other metal surfaces such as pt(110).@xcite",
    "we have shown from an interplay of stm and xps experiments and dft calculations that the oxidation of the ag(111 ) surface may be structurally more complex than previously anticipated .",
    "depending on the preparation conditions  oxidation agent , dose , and pressure , exposure time , and sample temperature during and after exposure  a large variety of different structures are found , essentially all of which may coexist . among these phases",
    "we have identified a number of structures , which are formed from ag@xmath1/ag@xmath2 fundamental building blocks .",
    "this group of structures comprises both the renowned @xmath0 surface as well as two phases of @xmath9rect and @xmath45rect symmetry .",
    "the @xmath13rect structure had been observed previously,@xcite but we have devised a structural model which is in line with the geometries for the @xmath0 ( refs . and ) and @xmath9rect phases ( ref . ) proposed recently and discussed in more detail here .",
    "in addition , we have observed two additional structures of @xmath3 and stripe character .",
    "the present results suggest that a complex coexistence of oxide and oxygen adsorbate overlayers with varying contents of oxygen may form under the conditions of industrial oxidation catalysis .",
    "this is in contrast to the prevalent perception that the @xmath11 phase alone represents an adequate model for the surface under such conditions .",
    "it is conceivable that the complexity of the phase diagram has a profound influence on the dynamics of the catalytic process .",
    "hence , although an increased understanding of the structure of the oxidized silver surface is presently being obtained as demonstrated in this and other studies,@xcite we are still far from a detailed understanding of the oxidized silver surface under reaction conditions .",
    "it appears likely that the structure of the silver oxide surface may vary in response to changes in the gas composition and the chemical potential of the reaction intermediates .    the competent assistance of the staff of the mechanical workshop of the department of physics and astronomy in aarhus is gratefully acknowledged .",
