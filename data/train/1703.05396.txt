    "<S> in addition , the absence of measurable phonon softening at high @xmath11 , indicates that the laser - induced temperature rise remains moderate , likely below @xmath22  @xcite .    on the other hand , for coupled gr / mose@xmath0 , @xmath23 distinctly rises as @xmath11 increases , whereas @xmath24 decreases ( see figs .  </S>",

    "<S> since there are no similar effects whatsoever for gr / sio@xmath0 and decoupled gr / mose@xmath0 , we conclude that the observed doping arises from photoinduced ict from mose@xmath0 to graphene .    </S>",

    "<S> such a correlation can be conveniently used to distinguish between electron and hole doping  @xcite . as @xmath11 increases </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , on coupled gr / mose@xmath0 @xmath25 and @xmath23 follow a linear correlation with a slope of @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to several resonant features involving finite momentum phonons  @xcite , one can identify the two raman - active one - phonon modes ( involving zone - center optical phonons ) in single - layer mose@xmath0 : ( i ) the out - of - plane , out - of - phase vibration of the se planes with @xmath27 symmetry near @xmath28 and ( ii ) the in - plane vibration of the mo and se planes against each other with @xmath29 symmetry near @xmath30  @xcite . as expected for single - layer mose@xmath0 , no low - frequency layer breathing and shear modes </S>",
    "<S> are observed . the faint @xmath29 mode - feature is slightly downshifted on coupled gr / mose@xmath0 , as compared to mose@xmath0/sio@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]b ) .    as in the case of graphene , </S>",
    "<S> changes in the raman spectra can tentatively be assigned to doping , with possible spurious contributions from native strain and laser - induced heating . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , recent raman studies in mos@xmath0 monolayers have demonstrated that the @xmath27-mode phonon undergoes modest doping - induced phonon renormalization , namely a downshift and a broadening for increasing electron concentration whereas the @xmath29-mode phonon is largely insensitive to doping  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , also in mos@xmath0 , it was shown that under tensile ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> compressive ) strain the @xmath29-mode feature undergoes much larger shifts than the @xmath27-mode feature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 and @xmath29 phonons may thus be used as probes of ict and strain , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> based on these considerations , the minute @xmath29 phonon softening observed ( irrespective of @xmath11 ) in gr / mose@xmath0 relative to mose@xmath0/sio@xmath0 suggests a slightly larger native tensile strain on gr / mose@xmath0 , that has no impact whatsoever on ict . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the slightly upshifted and narrower @xmath27-mode feature consistently observed up to @xmath33 in coupled gr / mose@xmath0 suggests a lower electron density in mose@xmath0 than in decoupled gr / mose@xmath0 and mose@xmath0/sio@xmath0 , supporting our working hypothesis of photoinduced electron transfer from mose@xmath0 to graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> however , on the three regions of the sample , the frequency and fwhm of the @xmath27-mode feature downshifts and increases linearly as @xmath11 augments , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such trends can not be attributed to photoinduced ict and counter - intuitively suggest photoinduced electron doping in mose@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively assign the observed evolution of the @xmath27-mode feature to slight laser - induced temperature increase ( estimated below @xmath22@xcite at @xmath34 ) , possibly combined with related photogating effects involving the unavoidable presence of molecular adsorbates and laser - assisted desorption  @xcite .    nevertheless , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c , the difference between the @xmath27 frequencies ( fwhm ) measured on coupled gr / mose@xmath0 and decoupled gr / mose@xmath0 or mose@xmath0/sio@xmath0 monotonically increases ( decreases ) as @xmath11 augments . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest a net photoinduced hole doping for mose@xmath0 in coupled gr / mose@xmath0 , relative to decoupled gr / mose@xmath0 and mose@xmath0/sio@xmath0 , consistently with the strong evidence for photoinduced electron transfer from mose@xmath0 to graphene revealed in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> when visible light is shined onto the gr / mose@xmath0 vdwh , excitons are mainly created in mose@xmath0 since the latter absorbs significantly more than graphene  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this value compares reasonably well with density functional theory calculations , including gw corrections  @xcite and is consistent with recent electrical measurements in gr - wse@xmath0 vdwhs that reported an electron affinity of @xmath50 for wse@xmath0  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus far , we have analyzed how ict depends on the intrinsic features of a vdwh . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the influence of environmental effects on the ict rate . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4]d compares the evolution of @xmath35 with increasing @xmath11 recorded under ambient conditions and in vacuum on the same spot of a vdwh ( s@xmath51 ) . in both cases , @xmath35 saturates at around @xmath52 above the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> however , by performing a phenomenological fit to a saturation curve , we estimate a saturation @xmath11 of @xmath53 in vacuum that is about 20 times smaller than in ambient conditions ( @xmath54 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distinct behaviors observed under ambient conditions and in vacuum shed light on the role of molecular adsorbates at the surface of the vdwh , which may act as efficient traps for the photo - transferred carriers and strongly influence the steady state charge carrier concentrations as a function of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> such environmental effects provide an impetus for further studies under controlled atmospheres  @xcite , using different substrates and encapsulating materials such as boron nitride  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ * conclusion and outlook  * _ we have demonstrated that micro - raman scattering spectroscopy provides a swift and quantitative probe of photoinduced charge transfer in graphene / tmd van der waals heterostructures . as compared to electron transport measurements  @xcite , our approach is contactless and allows spatially - resolved investigations of the charge transfer efficiency . as an illustrative example , on a same sample we have shown that the significant electron transfer observed from mose@xmath0 to a tightly coupled graphene layer vanishes for van der waals gap between the charge donor and acceptor layers as small as @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation confirms the very short range character of the interlayer charge transfer process .    </S>",
    "<S> our work invites further applications for reversible and spatially - resolved photogating of graphene since photoinduced doping levels as high as @xmath56  similar to those obtained using conventional gate dielectrics  can be reached . </S>",
    "<S> although measurements of the graphene raman modes certainly provide the most distinctive hallmark of photoinduced doping , the raman response of the tmd layer also displays convincing evidence for interlayer charge transfer . as a result , raman spectroscopy is an appealing technique to probe charge transfer and interlayer excitons in type ii tmd / tmd heterostructures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the observation of a strongly non - linear increase of the transferred charge density as the incident photon flux augments , together with a seemingly universal saturation value of the graphene fermi energy paves the way towards all - optical investigations of band alignments in van der waals heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> combined electron transport  @xcite and optical measurements should unveil the impact of strong bandgap renormalization and exciton binding energy in transition metal dichalcogenides on their optoelectronic properties .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , our first hint of interlayer coupling was provided by the observation of strong photoluminescence quenching in gr / mose@xmath0 heterostructures ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> photoluminescence quenching may arise from charge transfer but also from near - field energy transfer , as well documented in hybrid systems made of nanoscale emitters ( molecules , quantum dots , quantum wells ,  ) coupled to carbon nanotubes  @xcite , graphene  @xcite , tmd  @xcite , and recently in tmd / tmd type ii heterostructures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> probing the photoluminescence dynamics while monitoring the charge transfer efficiency would bring invaluable insights into near - field interlayer coupling in two - dimensional materials .    </S>",
    "<S> * _ methods  _ * gr / mose@xmath0 vdwhs were prepared using a viscoelactic transfer technique  @xcite . in a first step , </S>",
    "<S> single - layer mose@xmath0 flakes were obtained by mechanical exfoliation of commercially available bulk crystals ( hq graphene ) onto si wafers covered with a 90 nm thick sio@xmath0 epilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the single layers were identified from optical contrast and further confirmed by the observation of bright photoluminescence near @xmath57 ( pl ) and raman measurements  @xcite . in a second step , single - layer graphene flakes were mechanically exfoliated from natural graphite onto polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) stamps ( gel - pak 4 ) and identified by optical microscopy . in a third step , the two layers are aligned and carefully brought into contact using a mask aligner ( karl suss mjb3 ) . finally , the pdms stamp is slowly peeled off . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1]a shows an example of the resulting vdwh .    </S>",
    "<S> the gr / mose@xmath0 vdwhs were first characterized by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and then by micro - pl and micro - raman measurements . </S>",
    "<S> pl and raman studies were carried out in ambient conditions , in a backscattering geometry , using a home - built confocal microscope equipped with 40@xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and 100@xmath58 ( @xmath60 ) air objectives for mapping and single - spot measurements , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar measurements were also performed in a vacuum pressure ( at @xmath61 ) using a 50@xmath58 ( @xmath62 ) objective . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were optically excited using a single longitudinal mode , linearly polarized , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) continuous wave laser . </S>",
    "<S> the collected light was dispersed onto a charged - coupled device ( ccd ) array by a single ( 500  nm in focal length ) monochromator equipped with a 150 ( resp . 900 for graphene , 2400 for mose@xmath0 ) </S>",

    "<S> spectral resolutions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 were obtained for raman measurements with the 900 and 2400 grooves / mm grating , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sample holder was mounted onto a x - y - z piezoelectric stage , allowing hyperspectral imaging .    the incident photon flux @xmath11 is obtained by measuring the laser power and by dividing it by the product of the laser photon energy and the area of the laser spot . </S>",
    "<S> the area of the laser spot was measured by fitting an optical image of the tightly focused laser spot on the surface of a substrate using a two - dimensional gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> we found an area of @xmath67 for the @xmath68 objective , @xmath69 for the @xmath70 objective and @xmath71 for the @xmath72 objective . </S>",
    "<S> for an optical power of @xmath73 at the objective , these values lead to photon fluxes of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the pl data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] have been recorded at sufficiently low @xmath11 , in the linear regime .    finally , the raman peaks are fit using lorentzian and modified lorentzian  @xcite profiles for the g- and 2d - mode features , respectively , and voigt profiles ( with a fixed gaussian width taking into account our spectral resolution ) for mose@xmath0 features . therefore in fig .  </S>",
