    "a convex @xmath2 structure on @xmath3 is the quotient of a properly convex open set in @xmath2 by a free and cocompact action of a group of projective transformations . identifying this convex domain with the projectivization of a convex cone in @xmath7",
    ", one can consider smooth convex surfaces in @xmath7 that are asymptotic to the boundary of the cone .",
    "a fundamental theorem of cheng and yau @xcite ( proving a conjecture of calabi @xcite ) shows that there is a unique such surface which is a _ complete hyperbolic affine sphere_. classical affine - differential constructions equip this affine sphere with a @xmath8-invariant riemann surface structure and holomorphic cubic differential ( the _ pick differential _ ) , and the respective @xmath8-quotients of these give a point in @xmath5 .",
    "the surjectivity of this map from @xmath2 structures to @xmath5 is established using a method of c.  p.",
    "wang , wherein the reconstruction of an affine sphere from the cubic differential data is reduced to the solution of a quasilinear pde .    since wang s technique and the cheng - yau theorem apply to any properly convex domain",
    ", it would broadly generalize the labourie - loftin parameterization if one could characterize those pairs of simply - connected riemann surfaces and holomorphic cubic differentials that arise from properly convex open sets in @xmath2 .",
    "that is the basic motivating question we consider in this paper .",
    "as stated , this question is probably too broad to have a satisfactorily complete answer .",
    "however , the question can be specialized in many ways by asking to characterize the cubic differentials corresponding to a special class of convex sets , or the convex sets arising from a special class of cubic differentials .",
    "of course the labourie - loftin parameterization can be described this way , where one requires the convex domain to carry a cocompact group action of a given topological type .",
    "benoist and hulin have also considered aspects of this question , first for convex domains covering a noncompact surface of finite area @xcite , and later showing that domains with gromov - hyperbolic hilbert metrics correspond to the banach space of @xmath9 cubic differentials on the hyperbolic plane @xcite .",
    "we consider another specialization of the motivating question that is essentially orthogonal to those of labourie - loftin and benoist - hulin , namely , identifying riemann surfaces and holomorphic cubic differentials that correspond to _ convex polygons _ in @xmath2 .",
    "our main result is that the associated affine spheres give parabolic riemann surfaces ( biholomorphic to @xmath10 ) and cubic differentials that are complex polynomials , with the degree of the polynomial determined by the number of vertices of the polygon .",
    "for example , the affine sphere over the regular pentagon corresponds to the complex plane with the cubic differential @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12-fold rotational symmetry of the pentagon corresponds to the invariance of @xmath11 under the automorphism @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , as in the compact surface case , the affine sphere construction gives a homeomorphic identification between two moduli spaces .",
    "consider the space of cubic differentials @xmath14 on the complex plane where @xmath15 is a polynomial of degree @xmath0 , and let @xmath16 denote the quotient of this set by the action of the holomorphic automorphism group @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the space of projective equivalence classes of convex polygons in @xmath2 with @xmath19 vertices .",
    "we show :    [ introthm : main ] the affine sphere construction determines a homeomorphism @xmath20 that is , each polynomial cubic differential @xmath21 is the pick differential of a complete hyperbolic affine sphere @xmath22 , uniquely determined up to the action of @xmath23 and asymptotic to the cone over a convex polygon @xmath24 .",

    "since both of these are smooth orbifolds , it is natural to ask about the smoothness of the map @xmath25 itself .",
    "this issue and related conjectures are discussed in section [ sec : conjectures ] .",
    "our proof of the main theorem is direct : we construct mutually inverse maps @xmath31 and @xmath32 and show that each is continuous .",
    "( most of the time we actually work with the lifted map between manifold covers of these orbifold moduli spaces , but we elide this distinction in the introduction . )      the construction of the map @xmath33 first requires an existence theorem , i.e.  for any polynomial cubic differential on @xmath10 there exists a corresponding complete hyperbolic affine sphere . as in the work of labourie and loftin , through the technique of",
    "wang this becomes a problem about finding a conformal metric  the _ blaschke metric _ of the affine sphere  that satisfies a quasilinear pde involving the norm of the cubic differential .",
    "the cubic differential and the blaschke metric together determine a flat @xmath34-valued connection form , the trivialization of which gives the affine sphere ( and a framing thereof ) .",
    "the technique we apply to solve for the blaschke metric ( the method of super- and sub - solutions ) naturally gives a result for a somewhat more general class of equations . in section [ sec : vortex ]",
    "we show :    [ introthm : vortex ] let @xmath35 be a holomorphic differential on @xmath10 with @xmath36 a polynomial .",
    "then there exists a unique complete and nonpositively curved conformal metric @xmath37 on @xmath10 whose gaussian curvature function @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 here @xmath40 denotes the pointwise norm of @xmath41 with respect to the hermitian metric @xmath42 on the bundle of order-@xmath43 holomorphic differentials .",
    "the existence part of this result appears in theorem [ thm : existence ] , and the uniqueness in theorem [ thm : uniqueness ] ; the details are modeled on those found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we call the differential equation considered in this theorem the _ coupled vortex equation _ ; the connection between this equation and the classical vortex equation from gauge theory is described at the beginning of section [ sec : vortex ] .",
    "returning to the construction of @xmath25 , the case @xmath44 of theorem [ introthm : vortex ] implies that there exists a complete affine sphere with any given polynomial pick differential .",
    "the next step is to show that these affine spheres are asymptotic to cones over convex polygons with the right number of vertices .      the simplest examples of complete affine spheres with nonzero pick form are the _ ieica surfaces_. these can be characterized as the affine spheres conformal to @xmath10 and having constant nonzero pick differential ; all such surfaces are projectively equivalent , and each is asymptotic to the cone over a triangle",
    ".    a polynomial cubic differential on @xmath10 can be identified , after removing a compact set containing the zeros , with the result of gluing of a finite collection of half - planes , each equipped with a constant differential @xmath45 .",
    "using this description , we show that the asymptotic geometry of an affine sphere with polynomial pick differential ( briefly , a _ polynomial affine sphere _ ) can be asymptotically modeled by gluing together pieces of finitely many ieica surfaces .",
    "corresponding pieces of the asymptotic triangular cones glue to give the cone over a convex polygon .",
    "an important aspect of the picture that is missing from the sketch above represents most of the work we do in section [ sec : polynomials - to - polygons ] : in order to compare an affine sphere to a ieica surface , one must control not only the pick differential , but also the blaschke metric . analyzing the structure equations defining an affine sphere , this becomes a question of comparing the _ blaschke error _ , meaning the difference between the blaschke metric of a polynomial affine sphere and that of a ieica surface , to the _ frame size _ of the ieica surface , meaning the spectral radius of its affine frame in the adjoint representation .",
    "if the product of frame size and blaschke error decays to zero in some region , we find a unique ieica surface to which the polynomial affine sphere is asymptotic .",
    "using our estimates for solutions to the coupled vortex equation , we find that the blaschke error decays exponentially , and more precisely that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the distance from the zeros of the polynomial ( measured in a natural coordinate system ) . in the same coordinates ,",
    "the affine frame of the ieica surface grows exponentially , but the rate depends on direction , i.e.   @xmath48 along a ray of angle @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an explicit function satisfying @xmath51 with equality for exactly @xmath52 directions , for a polynomial of degree @xmath0 .",
    "away from these _ unstable directions _ , the error decay is therefore more rapid than the frame growth and we have a unique asymptotic ieica surface , giving @xmath52 ieica surfaces in all .",
    "the final step in the construction of @xmath25 is to understand how the limiting ieica surface changes when we cross an unstable direction .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , in this analysis the @xmath53 factor in our bound for the error turns out to be crucial ( and sharp ) .    by integrating the affine connection form over an arc of a circle of radius @xmath54 joining two rays that lie on either side of an unstable direction , we determine the element of @xmath23 relating the limiting ieica surfaces along these rays .",
    "the interplay between the quadratic approximation to @xmath50 near its @xmath55 maximum and the blaschke error estimate show that this integral is essentially a gaussian approximation to a delta function in @xmath49 multiplied by an off - diagonal elementary matrix .",
    "letting @xmath56 we find that the neighboring ieica surfaces are related by a particular type of unipotent projective transformation .",
    "these unipotent factors are the `` glue '' that let us move from an understanding of asymptotics in one direction , or in a sector , to the global picture . using them , we find that each of the @xmath52 transitions across an unstable direction reveals either a new edge or a new vertex , alternating to give a chain that closes up to form a convex polygon @xmath24 with @xmath57 vertices .",
    "the polynomial affine sphere is asymptotic to the cone over @xmath24 .",
    "after the fact , the triangles associated to the individual ieica surfaces can also be described directly in terms of the polygon @xmath24 : each vertex of @xmath24 forms a triangle with its two neighbors , giving @xmath57 _ vertex inscribed triangles _ of @xmath24 .",
    "each edge of @xmath24 forms a triangle with the lines extending the two neighboring edges , giving @xmath57 _ edge circumscribed triangles _ of @xmath24 .",
    "each transition across an unstable direction flips from a vertex inscribed triangle to one of its neighboring edge circumscribed triangles , or vice versa ( see figure [ fig : triangles ] ) .",
    "alternate in a natural cyclic order .",
    "ieica surfaces over these triangles assemble into an asymptotic model for the affine sphere over the polygon . ]",
    "constructing the inverse map @xmath58 amounts to showing that an affine sphere over a convex polygon has parabolic conformal type ( i.e.  is isomorphic to @xmath10 as a riemann surface ) and that the pick differential is a polynomial in the uniformizing coordinate .",
    "these properties are established in section [ sec : polygons - to - polynomials ] .    in this case",
    "there is no question of existence , as the cheng - yau theorem gives a complete affine sphere over any convex polygon ( or indeed any properly convex set ) . to understand the conformal type and pick differential of this affine sphere",
    ", we once again use the ieica surface as the key model and comparison object .",
    "the arguments are somewhat simpler than in the construction of @xmath25 described above .",
    "benoist and hulin , using interior estimates of cheng - yau , showed that the @xmath43-jet of the affine sphere at a point depends continuously on the corresponding convex domain @xcite .",
    "this implies that the blaschke metric and pick differential vary continuously in this sense ( see theorem [ thm : support - function - continuous ] and corollary [ cor : blaschke - and - pick - continuous ] below ) .",
    "we use this continuity principle and projective naturality to compare the affine sphere over a polygon to the ieica surface over one of its vertex inscribed polygons .",
    "we find that the blaschke metric and the pick differential of the polygonal affine sphere are comparable ( with uniform multiplicative constants ) to those of the ieica surface , at any point that is sufficiently close to the edges shared by the triangle and the polygon . applying this construction to each of the vertex inscribed triangles , we find a `` buffer '' around the boundary of the polygon that contains no zeros of the pick differential , and where the blaschke metric is approximately euclidean .",
    "it follows easily that the pick form has finitely many zeros , that the conformal type of the blaschke metric is @xmath10 , and finally that the pick form is a polynomial .",
    "having established that polynomial affine spheres correspond to polygons and vice versa , the proof of the main theorem is completed by theorem [ thm : main - in - text ] , where we use estimates and results from the preceding sections to show that this bijection between moduli spaces and its inverse are continuous . also , since the normalization conventions of sections [ sec : polynomials - to - polygons ] and [ sec : polygons - to - polynomials ] implicitly require working in manifold @xmath59-covers of the moduli spaces , we verify at this stage that our the constructions have the necessary equivariance properties to descend to the orbifolds themselves .",
    "the comparison between rates of error decay and frame growth which yields the finite set of asymptotic ieica surfaces for a polynomial affine sphere is an apparently novel element of our work on this class of surfaces .",
    "however , we build upon a substantial history of error estimates for wang s equation and other geometric pde . while both loftin @xcite and labourie @xcite focused on the wang equation in their studies of affine spheres , loftin ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) began and developed a theory of error estimates for this equation .",
    "the structurally similar bochner equation governing harmonic maps to hyperbolic surfaces had an analogous development of error estimates in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "crucial to refined error estimates are the use of sub- and super - solutions , first constructed in the present setting by loftin @xcite ; for the analogous bochner equation and for open riemann surfaces , this technique began with @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the passage from estimates for the solution of wang s equation to an asymptotic description of the affine frame field requires an understanding the behavior of solutions to certain ordinary differential equations ( i.e.  the affine structure equations restricted to a curve ) .",
    "the technique we use here was introduced by loftin in @xcite ; there was no lower - dimensional bochner equation analogue to this technique .      to conclude the introduction we briefly comment on the potential relations between our main theorem and techniques from areas such as higgs bundles and minimal surfaces .",
    "some more concrete conjectures and possible extensions of our work are described after the proof of the main theorem , in section [ sec : conjectures ] .    in @xcite",
    ", labourie interprets the parameterization of convex @xmath2 structures by cubic differentials in terms of certain rank-@xmath60 higgs bundles , thus identifying wang s equation for the blaschke metric of an affine sphere with hitchin s self - duality equations for these bundles .",
    "the same construction applies in our setting : compactifying @xmath10 to @xmath61 , our polynomial affine spheres correspond to _ irregular higgs bundles _ on the projective line defined by a vector bundle and a meromorphic endomorphism - valued @xmath62-form ( which in this case has a single high - order pole ) .",
    "our existence theorem for wang s equation ( theorem [ thm : existence ] ) is therefore equivalent to the existence of solutions to the self - duality equations for these bundles .",
    "the self - duality equations have been studied in the irregular case by biquard - boalch @xcite , extending simpson s work for the case of a simple pole @xcite .",
    "however , there is a mismatch of hypotheses preventing us from deducing theorem [ thm : existence ] directly from results in the higgs bundle literature : the _ irregular type _ of the higgs fields we consider , i.e.  the laurent expansion of the higgs field at the pole , has nilpotent coefficient in the most singular term , while the type is usually assumed to be a regular semisimple element ( for example in the results of @xcite ) .",
    "witten has proposed a way to generalize results from the semisimple case to arbitrary irregular types using branched coverings @xcite , however a sketch is provided only in rank @xmath63 and the details of a corresponding existence theorem have not appeared .",
    "we expect that pursuing these ideas further , one could give an alternate proof of theorem [ thm : existence ] entirely by higgs bundle methods .",
    "the connection with irregular higgs bundles also suggests that our main theorem could be related to the general phenomenon of equivalence between _ dolbeault moduli spaces _ of higgs bundles and _ betti moduli spaces _ of representations of the fundamental group of a riemann surface into a complex lie group .",
    "it is known that the generalized betti moduli space which corresponds to irregular higgs bundles includes extra _ stokes data _ at each pole of the higgs field ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this data consists of a collection of unipotent matrices cyclically ordered around each pole , and the possibility of a connection with the unipotent factors we find for a polygonal affine sphere in lemma [ lem : unipotent - factors ] is intriguing .",
    "we hope that by further developing this connection , one could interpret theorem [ introthm : main ] as identifying the space of convex polygons in @xmath2 ( stratified by the number of vertices ) as a generalization of the hitchin component of @xmath23 representations to the punctured riemann surface @xmath10 ( with a stratification by the order of pole of the associated higgs field at infinity ) .    finally , we mention another interpretation of the affine sphere construction discussed by labourie in @xcite : the combination of the blaschke metric and the affine frame field of a convex surface in @xmath7 induces a map to the symmetric space @xmath64 which is a minimal immersion exactly when the original surface is an affine spherical immersion ( the local version of being an affine sphere ) . by this construction , the flats of the symmetric space correspond to ieica affine spheres .",
    "our main theorem can therefore be seen as identifying a moduli space of minimal planes in @xmath64 that are asymptotic to finite collections of flats ( in some sense that corresponds to theorem [ thm : exponential - bound ] ) with a space of polynomial cubic differentials .",
    "it would be interesting to develop this picture more fully , for example by characterizing these minimal planes directly in terms of riemannian geometry of the symmetric space , and possibly generalizing to the symmetric space of @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",

    "mw appreciates the hospitality of the morningside center where some of this work was done .",
    "as in the introduction we will consider polygons in @xmath2 up to the action of the group @xmath67 of projective transformations .",
    "an elementary fact we will frequently use is :    the group @xmath23 acts simply transitively on @xmath68-tuples of points in @xmath2 in general position .",
    "our convention is that a _ convex polygon _ in @xmath2 is a bounded open subset of an affine chart @xmath69 that is the intersection of finitely many half - planes . in particular",
    "a polygon is an open @xmath63-manifold homeomorphic to the disk @xmath70 . as usual ,",
    "a polygon can also be specified by the @xmath62-complex that forms its boundary , or by its set of vertices .    by _ orientation _ of the polygon we mean an orientation of its interior , as a @xmath63-manifold , or equivalently an orientation of its boundary as a @xmath62-complex .",
    "whenever we list the vertices of an oriented polygon , it is understood that the list is ordered consistently with the orientation .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the set of oriented convex polygons in @xmath2 with @xmath43 vertices ( briefly , _",
    "convex @xmath43-gons _ ) ; this is an open subset of the symmetric product @xmath72 .",
    "the group @xmath23 of projective automorphisms acts on @xmath71 with quotient @xmath73 the _ moduli space _ of convex polygons . for @xmath74",
    "we denote by @xmath29 $ ] its equivalence class in @xmath75 .    by suitably normalizing a polygon",
    ", one can construct a natural `` quasi - section '' of the map @xmath76 : choose an oriented convex quadrilateral @xmath77 with vertices @xmath78 .",
    "this polygon @xmath79 and the labeling of its vertices will be fixed throughout the paper .",
    "we say that @xmath74 , @xmath80 , is _ normalized _ if it is obtained from @xmath79 by attaching a convex @xmath81-gon to its @xmath82 edge .",
    "equivalently , an oriented convex polygon is normalized if its vertices are @xmath83 for some @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "in particular the vertices of a normalized polygon have a canonical labeling by @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the set of normalized convex @xmath43-gons in @xmath2 .",
    "having fixed four vertices , the set @xmath88 is naturally is an open subset of @xmath89 .",
    "in fact @xmath88 is contractible :    [ prop : polygon - global - topology ] the space @xmath88 is diffeomorphic to @xmath90 .",
    "choose an affine chart of @xmath2 in which @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "by convexity , the remaining vertices of a normalized polygon must lie in the half - strip @xmath95 setting @xmath96 we also have that @xmath97 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath43 , while the slopes @xmath98 of the segments @xmath99 are monotonically increasing .",
    "up to those two constraints , we may freely choose the pairs @xmath100 for @xmath101 , which determine the polygon completely .",
    "thus @xmath88 is parameterized by a product of open simplices : @xmath102    it is easy to see that @xmath88 intersects every @xmath23-orbit in @xmath71 : given @xmath74 , any four adjacent vertices of @xmath24 are in general position and can therefore be mapped to @xmath103 by a unique element @xmath104 .",
    "thus @xmath105 and we say that @xmath106 _ normalizes _ @xmath24 .",
    "the only choice in the normalization construction is that of a vertex to map to @xmath107 , and so there are exactly @xmath43 ways to normalize an oriented convex @xmath43-gon @xmath24 ( though possibly some of them give the same normalized polygon ) .",
    "equivalently , the set of intersection points of a @xmath23-orbit in @xmath71 with @xmath88 has cardinality at most @xmath43 , and the projection @xmath108 is finite - to - one .",
    "furthermore , each fiber of this projection is the orbit of a natural @xmath109-action on @xmath88 : given @xmath110 with vertices @xmath111 , there is a projective transformation @xmath112 uniquely determined by its action on the @xmath68-tuple , @xmath113 then defining @xmath114 we have a map @xmath115 . by construction @xmath24 and @xmath116",
    "lie in the same @xmath23-orbit and @xmath117 follows since @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a projective transformation fixing the vertices of @xmath79 , hence @xmath120 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath121 acts diffeomorphically on @xmath122 , and in fact it acts by the restriction of a rational map defined over @xmath123 .    summarizing the discussion above ,",
    "we find :    [ prop : polygon - cyclic - quotient ] the projection @xmath124 can be identified with the quotient map of the @xmath109 action on @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath75 has the structure of an orbifold with universal cover @xmath125 .",
    "the fact that any convex polygon has a unique normalization once a vertex is chosen also shows that @xmath88 can be identified with a quotient space related to @xmath75 : if we consider a space of pairs @xmath126 where @xmath74 and @xmath127 is a vertex of @xmath24 , then the quotient of this space of _ labeled polygons _",
    "by @xmath23 is in canonical bijection with @xmath88 . in this description , the @xmath109 action cycles @xmath127 around @xmath24 while the map @xmath128 corresponds to @xmath124 .",
    "the notations @xmath129 are meant to suggest _ teichmller space _ and _ moduli space _ , respectively . in this analogy ,",
    "the additional data of a normalization of a polygon is like the marking of a riemann surface , and the @xmath109 action plays the role of the mapping class group . on both sides of the analogy ,",
    "the teichmller space is contractible and smooth , while the quotient moduli space is only an orbifold .",
    "( compare the `` toy model '' of the space of convex projective structures described in @xcite . )",
    "so far we have considered our spaces of polygons to be topological spaces using what could be called the _ vertex topology _ ,",
    "i.e.  by considering the set of vertices of the polygon as a point in the symmetric product of @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , one could introduce a topology on polygons using the hausdorff metric on closed subsets of @xmath2 ; here ( and throughout the paper ) we take the closures of the convex domains whenever the hausdorff topology is considered .",
    "in fact these topologies are equivalent ; it is immediate that vertex convergence implies hausdorff convergence , and conversely we have :    [ prop : hausdorff - vertex - equivalent ] if a sequence @xmath130 of convex polygons converges in the hausdorff topology to a convex polygon @xmath24 , and if @xmath24 and @xmath130 all have the same number of vertices , then @xmath130 also converges to @xmath24 in the vertex topology .",
    "first observe , each extreme point of the limit set is a limit of extreme points of the sequence . ] that each vertex of @xmath127 of @xmath24 is a limit of a sequence @xmath131 of vertices of @xmath130 : otherwise @xmath127 would be a limit of interior points of edges , but not of their endpoints .",
    "by passing to a subsequence we could arrange for this sequence of edges to converge , giving a line segment in @xmath24 of which @xmath127 is an interior point , contradicting the assumption that @xmath127 is a vertex .",
    "suppose @xmath24 has @xmath43 vertices .",
    "applying the observation above to each vertex in turn we obtain @xmath43 sequences , each having as @xmath132 element a vertex of @xmath130 . while these sequences may overlap for some @xmath19 , this can only happen for finitely many terms since these sequences have distinct limit points .",
    "thus for all large @xmath19 we have labeled the @xmath43 vertices of @xmath130 in such a way that vertices with a given label converge , as required .",

    "however , one would also need to control the variation of the uniformizing coordinate @xmath252 in which the pick differential becomes a polynomial .",
    "assuming for the moment that @xmath888 is a diffeomorphism , several questions arise about its possible compatibility with additional differential - geometric structures of its domain and range .",

    "it is natural to ask whether the images of circle orbits in @xmath972 could be recognized in terms of intrinsic features of that space , or in terms of projective geometry of polygons , without direct reference to the map @xmath25 .",
    "for example , there is a natural poisson structure on a space closely related to @xmath75 : define a _ twisted polygon _ with @xmath43 vertices to be a map @xmath973 that conjugates the translation @xmath974 of @xmath123 with a projective transformation @xmath975 .",

    "is it the restriction of hamiltonian flow on @xmath978 ?",
