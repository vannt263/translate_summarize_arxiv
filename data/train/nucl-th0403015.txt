    "since the 80s of the last century , the radioactive ion beams have been used intensively to measure the total reaction cross sections and interaction cross sections induced by unstable nuclei on stable targets ( see a recent review in ref .",

    "the discovery of exotic structures of unstable nuclei , such as neutron halos or neutron skins , are among the most fascinating results of this study .    the theoretical tool used dominantly by now to analyze the interaction cross sections measured at energies of several hundred mev / nucleon is the glauber model @xcite which is based on the eikonal approximation .",
    "this approach provides a simple connection between the ground state densities of the two colliding nuclei and the total reaction cross section of the system and has been used , in particular , to deduce the nuclear density parameters for the neutron - rich halo nuclei @xcite .    in general , the total reaction cross section , which measures the loss of flux from the elastic channel ,",

    "perhaps , that is the reason why different versions of glauber model are widely used to calculate  at high energies .",
    "depending on the structure model for the nuclear wave functions used in the calculation , those glauber model calculations can be divided into two groups : the calculations using a simple optical limit of glauber model ( see ref .",

    "the use of the @xmath2-matrix interaction corresponds to the so - called _ impulse approximation _ ( ia ) , where the medium modifications of the nn interaction are neglected @xcite .    in the present folding calculation",

    "is sometimes referred to as the folding model @xcite , we find it necessary to highlight the distinctive features of the present folding approach in comparison with the ol of glauber model before going to discuss the results of calculation .    on the level of the optical potential ( op ) ,",

    "double - zero \" approximation which reduces the complex finite - range @xmath2-matrix interaction ( [ v1 ] ) to a _ zero - range _ ( purely imaginary ) nn scattering amplitude at _ zero _ nn _ angle _ @xmath60 that can be further expressed through the total nn cross section @xmath61 , using the optical theorem . as a result , one needs to evaluate in the ol of glauber model only a simple folding integral over local densities of the two colliding nuclei @xcite @xmath62    the prescription ( [ eol ] ) is also known as the @xmath63 approximation @xcite which neglects the off - shell part of the @xmath2-matrix . besides the inaccuracy caused by the use of zero - range approximation @xcite , the zero - angle approximation takes into account only the on - shell @xmath2-matrix at zero momentum transfer ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .",
    "since the antisymmetrization of @xmath64 requires an accurate estimation of the nn knock - on exchange term which is strongest at _ large _ momentum transfers ( @xmath65 @xmath66 at energies around 0.8 gev @xcite ) , the zero - angle approximation could strongly reduce the strength of the exchange term .",
    "a question remains , therefore , whether the nn antisymmetry is properly taken into account when one uses the empirical @xmath61 in the glauber folding integral ( [ eol ] ) .",
    "a similar aspect has been raised by brandan _",
    "@xcite who found that an _ overestimated _ absorption in the nucleus - nucleus system ( by the @xmath63 model ) is due to the effects of pauli principle . to illustrate the importance of the knock - on exchange term , we have plotted in fig .",

    "one can see that the exchange term of the real op is repulsive and much stronger than the ( attractive ) direct term , which makes the total real op repulsive at all internuclear distances ( see panel _ a _ of fig .  [ f0 ] ) .",
    "the exchange term of the imaginary op is also repulsive but its relative strength is much weaker compared to that of the real op , and the total imaginary op remains attractive or _ absorptive _ at all distances . as a result , the direct part of the imaginary op is about 10% more absorptive than the total imaginary op ( see panel _ b _ of fig .",

    "this value increases to  @xmath69 mb when the exchange potential @xmath70 is omitted in the om calculation .",
    "consequently , the relative contribution by the exchange term in  is about 3% .",
    "this difference is not small because it can lead to a difference of up to 7% in the extracted nuclear rms radii . due to an overwhelming contribution by the exchange part of the _ real _ op",
    ", the exchange potential affects the calculated elastic scattering cross section ( see fig .",

    ".    we will show below a slight ( but rather systematic ) difference in  values obtained in our approach and the ol of glauber model that might be due to the exchange effect .",
    "we note further that the elastic @xmath7-matrix is obtained in our approach rigorously from the quantal solution of the schrdinger equation for elastic scattering wave , while the elastic @xmath7-matrix used in the glauber model is given by the eikonal approximation which neglects the second - derivative term of the same schrdinger equation .",
    "a common feature of the present folding approach and the ol of glauber model is the use of single - particle nuclear densities of the projectile and target as input for the calculation , leaving out all few - body correlations to the structure model used to construct the density .",

    "such an explicit treatment of the dynamic few - body correlation leads consistently to a smaller , i.e. , to a larger nuclear radius compared to that given by the ol of glauber model @xcite . on the level of the hf - type folding calculation ( [ e5 ] )",
    ", an explicit treatment of the core and valence nucleons would result in a much more complicated triple - folding formalism which involves the antisymmetrization not only between the projectile nucleons and those of the target , but also between the nucleons of the core and the valence nucleons .",
    "such an approach would clearly end up with a _",
    "nonlocal _ op which will not be easily used with the existing direct reaction codes .",
    "the lack of an appropriate treatment of the dynamic few - body correlations remains , therefore , the main limitation of the present folding approach in the calculation of the op for systems involving unstable nuclei with halo - type structure .",
    "note that an effective way of taking into account the loose binding between the core and valence nucleons is to add a higher - order contribution from breakup ( dynamic polarization potential ) to the first - order folded potential @xcite or simply to renormalize the folded potential to fit the data .",
    "however , validity of the ia implies that higher - order multiple scattering or contribution from the dynamic polarization potential are negligible , and the folded op and inelastic form factor based on the @xmath2-matrix interaction ( [ v1 ] ) should be used in the calculations without any further renormalization .",

    "the best - fit ho densities give radii of 2.67 and 2.74 fm for @xmath120o and @xmath121o , respectively , which are rather close to those given by the ipm densities .",
    "predictions given by the microscopic hfb densities are also in a good agreement with the data for even o isotopes excepting the @xmath122o case , where the hfb density gives obviously a too small radius . since the hfb calculation already takes into account the continuum effects @xcite , such a deficiency might be due to the static deformation of @xmath122o .",
    "a jump in the value was found for @xmath123o which could indicate to a neutron halo in this isotope .",
    "behavior of radii given by the best - fit ho densities agrees with the trend established by the ol of glauber model @xcite but , like the case of c isotopes , they are about 0.1 fm larger than those deduced from the ol of glauber model .",
    "thus , the ol of glauber model seems to consistently overestimate  for the neutron - rich c and o isotopes under study in comparison with our approach .",
    "one clear reason for the difference between our results and those given by the ol of glauber model analysis is that one has matched directly the calculated  with the measured  in the glauber model analysis @xcite to deduce the nuclear radius .",
    "if we proceed the same way with the ho densities for the considered nuclei , the best - fit radii decrease slightly but are still larger than those given by the ol of glauber model . as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the _ zero - angle _",
    "approximation for the nn scattering amplitude used in the glauber model might reduce significantly the strength of the exchange part of the imaginary op given by eq .  ( [ eol ] ) and could overestimate , therefore , the absorption in the dinuclear system .",
    "this effect should be much stronger if one uses a realistic _ finite - range _ representation of the nn scattering amplitude .",
    "et al . _ have shown @xcite that the _ zero - range _",
    "approximation for the nn scattering amplitude leads to a reduction of the calculated  or an enhancement of the nuclear radius by a few percent ( see figs .  2 and 3 in ref .",
    "thanks to such a cancellation of the exchange effects by the zero - range approximation for nn scattering amplitude , the simple ol of glauber model was able to deliver reasonable estimates of nuclear radii for many stable and unstable isotopes @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the eikonal approximation for the scattering wave function used in the glauber model was introduced in the past to avoid large numerical calculations . with the computing power available today , there is no problem to perform the om and dwia calculations for different systems involving large numbers of partial waves , and the folding + dwia method presented here can be recommended as a reliable microscopic approach to predict the elastic scattering cross section and to deduce the nuclear radius from the measured .",
    "in this work we have explored the reliability of the optical model + dwia approach as a tool for extracting important information on nuclear sizes from interaction cross section measurements .",
    "we concentrate on the energy region of 0.8 to 1 gev / nucleon where interaction cross section data exist for various combinations of stable as well as unstable projectiles on different targets . at these bombarding energies",
    "our knowledge of the empirical optical potential is scarce , especially for unstable systems , and we have used , therefore , the folding model to calculate the microscopic ( complex ) optical potential and inelastic form factors necessary for our analysis .    we have chosen for the folding input the fully finite - range @xmath2-matrix interaction developed by franey and love @xcite .",
    "the folded optical potentials and inelastic form factors are used further as inputs for the standard optical model and dwia calculations of total reaction cross sections and interaction cross sections induced by stable and unstable he , li , c , and o isotopes on @xmath0c target . by using the well tested nuclear g.s .",
    "densities for the stable @xmath124he , @xmath0c and @xmath46o isotopes , we found that the franey and love @xmath2-matrix gives extremely good account of the measured  for these nuclei .",
    "we have further used the nuclear g.s .",
    "densities obtained in various structure models to calculate  and made realistic estimate for the nuclear radii of ( still poorly known ) neutron - rich isotopes based on the comparison between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the chains of c and o isotopes , our results agree reasonably well with the empirical trend established by the ol of glauber model @xcite , but give consistently larger radii for these nuclei .",
    "such an effect could be due to the unsatisfactory treatment of the exchange part of the nucleus - nucleus op in the glauber model calculation .    although the nuclear radii deduced by our approach for some light halo nuclei might be a few percent smaller than realistic values because the dynamic few - body correlation was not considered explicitly in the present folding + dwia formalism , this fully microscopic approach was shown to be more accurate than the ol of glauber model .",
    "given realistic nuclear densities , it can give a reliable ( parameter - free ) prediction of the nucleus - nucleus optical potential at energies around 1 gev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , it provides the necessary link to relate the calculated  to the nuclear density and rms radius .",
