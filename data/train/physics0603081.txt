    "a very interesting empirical phenomenon in the study of weighted networks is the power - law correlation between strength @xmath0 and degree @xmath1 of nodes @xmath2 @xcite . very recently , wang _",
    "et al _ have proposed a mutual selection model to explain the origin of this power - law correlation @xcite .",
    "this model can provide a partial explanation for social weighted networks , that is , although the general people want to make friend with powerful men , these powerful persons may not wish to be friendly to them .",
    "however , this model can not explain the origin of power - law strength - degree correlation in weighted technological networks .    in many cases ,",
    "the concepts of edge - weight and node - strength are associated with network dynamics .",
    "for example , the weight in communication networks is often defined by the load along with the edge @xcite , and the strength in epidemic contact networks is defined by the individual infectivity @xcite . on the one hand , although the weight / strength distribution may evolve into a stable form , the individual value is being changed with time by the dynamical process upon network . on the other hand , the weight / strength distribution will greatly affect the corresponding dynamic behaviors , such as the epidemic spreading and synchronization @xcite .    inspired by the interplay of weight and network dynamics , barrat , barthlemy , and vespignani proposed an evolution model ( bbv model for short ) for weighted networks @xcite .",
    "although this model can naturally reproduce the power - law distribution of degree , edge - weight , and node - strength , it fails to obtain the power - law correlation between strength and degree . in bbv model ,",
    "the dynamics of weight and network structure are assumed in the same time scale , that is , in each time step , the weight distribution and network topology change simultaneously .",
    "here we argue that the above two time scales are far different .",
    "actually , in many real - life situations , the individual weight varies momently whereas the network topology only slightly changes during a relatively long period .",
    "similar to the traffic dynamics based on the local routing protocol @xcite , we investigate the dynamic behaviors of resource / traffic flow on scale - free networks with given structures , which may give some illuminations about the origin of power - law correlation between strength and degree in weighted scale - free networks .",
    "as mentioned above , strength usually represents resources or substances allocated to each node , such as wealth of individuals of financial contact networks @xcite , the number of passengers in airports of world - wide airport networks @xcite , the throughput of power stations of electric power grids @xcite , and so on .",
    "these resources also flow constantly in networks : money shifts from one person to another by currency , electric power is transmitted to every city from power plants by several power hubs , and passengers travel from one airport to another . further more , resources prefers to flow to larger - degree nodes . in transport networks ,",
    "large nodes imply hubs or centers in traffic system .",
    "so passengers can get a quick arrival to the destinations by choosing larger airports or stations . in financial systems , people also like to buy stocks of larger companies or deposit more capital in the banks with more capital because larger companies and banks generally have more power to make profits and more capacity to avoid losses .",
    "inspired by the above facts , we propose a simple mechanism to describe the resource flow with preferential allocation in networks .",
    "[ 0.5 ] resources in node @xmath3 are divided into several pieces and then flow to its neighbors .",
    "the thicker lines imply there are more resources flowing .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in order to give a clearer illustration we do not plot the resource flow into node @xmath3 or out of node @xmath4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at each time , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , resources in each node are divided into several pieces and then flow to its neighbors .",
    "the amount of each piece is determined by its neighbors degrees .",
    "we can regulate the extent of preference by a tunable parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the equations of resource flow are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the amount of resources moving from node @xmath3 to @xmath4 at time @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the amount of resources owned by node @xmath3 at time @xmath8 , @xmath10 is the degree of node @xmath4 and @xmath11 is the set of neighbors of node @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath3 are not neighboring , then @xmath12",
    ". meanwhile each node also gets resources from its neighbors , so at time @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath4 @xmath15    [ 1 ]",
    "( color online ) the evolution of the strengths of node @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are randomly selected for observation .",
    "the three cases are in different initial states which simply satisfy @xmath18 . the exponent @xmath19.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.8 ] scatter plots of @xmath20 vs @xmath10 for all the nodes , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the eq . [ strength of node i ] can be expressed in terms of a matrix equation , which reads @xmath21 where the elements of matrix @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 since @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the spectral radius of matrix @xmath22 obeys the equality @xmath26 , according to the gershgrin disk theorem @xcite . here , the spectral radius , @xmath27 , of a matrix @xmath22 , is the largest absolute value of an eigenvalue .",
    "further more , since the considered network is symmetry - free ( that is to say , the network is strongly connected thus for any two nodes @xmath4 and @xmath3 , these exists at least one path from @xmath4 to @xmath3 ) , @xmath28 will converge to a constant matrix for infinite @xmath1 .",
    "that is , if given the initial boundary condition to eq .",
    "[ matrix ] ( e.g. let @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the total number of nodes in network ) , then @xmath31 will converge in the limit of infinite @xmath8 as @xmath32 for each node @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , denote @xmath33 , one can obtain @xmath34 that is , for any @xmath4 , @xmath35 from eq .",
    "[ kinetic equilibrium ] , it is clear that @xmath36 is just the kinetic equilibrium state of the resource flow in our model . since @xmath37 , @xmath36 is determined only by matrix @xmath22 , if given the initial boundary condition with @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 .",
    "since matrix @xmath22 is determined by the topology only , for each node @xmath4 in the kinetic equilibrium , @xmath40 is completely determined by the network structure .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the amount of resource eventually allocated to node @xmath4 , thus it is reasonable to define @xmath20 as the strength of node @xmath4 .",

    ", the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath5 is given , where the squares come from the simulations and the solid line represents the theoretical result @xmath42.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.8 ] ( color online ) the distribution of strength with different @xmath5 .",
    "the inset exhibits the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath5 , where the squares come from the simulations and the solid line represents the theoretic analysis @xmath44.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the solution of eq . ( 6 ) reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a normalized factor .    in principle",
    ", this solution gives the analytical relation between @xmath20 and @xmath10 when @xmath47 can be analytically obtained from the degree distribution . for uncorrelated networks",
    "@xcite , statistically speaking we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the probability a randomly selected node is of degree @xmath1 . since @xmath50 is a constant when given a network structure , one has @xmath51 , thus @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the average strength over all the nodes with degree @xmath1 .",
    "this power - law correlation @xmath54 where @xmath42 , observed in many real weighted networks , can be considered as a result of the conjunct effect of the above power - law correlation and the scale - free property . obviously ,",
    "if the degree distribution in a weighted network obeys the form @xmath55 , one can immediately obtain the distribution of the strength @xmath56 where the power - law exponent @xmath44 .",
    "recent empirical studies in network science show that many real - life networks display the scale - free property @xcite , thus we use scale - free networks as the samples .",
    "since the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite is the mostly studied model and lacks structural - biases such as non - zero degree - degree correlation , we use ba network with size @xmath57 and average degree @xmath58 for simulations .",
    "the dynamics start from a completely random distribution of resource . as is shown in fig .",
    "2 , we randomly pick two nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and record their strengths vs time @xmath59 and @xmath60 for three different initial conditions . clearly , the resource owned by each node will reach a stable state quickly . and no matter how and where the one unit resource flow in , the final state is the same .",
    "[ 0.8 ] ( color online ) the distributions of degree ( left panel ) and strength ( right panel ) with different @xmath5 .",
    "the networks are generated by the strength - pa mechanism , and those shown here are the sampling of size @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.8 ] ( color online ) the correlation between degree and strength with different @xmath5 . in the inset ,",
    "the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath5 is given , where the squares come from the simulations and the solid line represents the theoretical result @xmath42 .",
    "the networks are generated by the strength - pa mechanism , and those shown here are the sampling of size @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]    similar to the mechanism used to judge the weight of web by google - searching ( see a recent review paper @xcite about the _ pagerank algorithm _ proposed by google ) , the strength of a node is not only determined by its degree , but also by the strengths of its neighbors ( see eq . 7 ) .",
    "although statistically @xmath61 for uncorrelated networks , the strengths of the nodes with the same degree may be far different especially for low - degree nodes as exhibited in fig .",
    "3 .    in succession",
    ", we average the strengths of nodes with the same degree and plot fig . 4 to verify our theoretical analysis that there is a power - law correlation @xmath62 between strength and degree , with exponent @xmath42 .",
    "5 shows that the strength also obeys power - law distribution , as observed in many real - life scale - free weighted networks . and the simulations agree well with analytical results .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a model for resource - allocation dynamics on scale - free networks , in which the system can approach to a kinetic equilibrium state with power - law strength - degree correlation . if the resource flow is unbiased ( i.e. @xmath63 ) , similar to the bbv model @xcite , the strength will be linearly correlated with degree as @xmath64 . therefore , the present model suggests that the power - law correlation between degree and strength arises from the mechanism that resources in networks tend to flow to larger nodes rather than smaller ones .",
    "this preferential flow has been observed in some real traffic systems .",
    "for example , very recently , we investigated the empirical data of chinese city - airport network , where each node denote a city , and the edge - weight is defined as the number of passengers travelling along this edge per week @xcite .",
    "we found that the passenger number from one city to its larger - degree neighbor is much larger than that from this city to its smaller - degree neighbor .",
    "in addition , in chinese city - airport network @xcite and us airport network @xcite , the power - law exponents are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , which is within the range of @xmath41 predicted by the present model .",
    "the readers should be warned that the analytical solution shown in this paper is only valid for static networks without any degree - degree correlation .",
    "however , we have done some further simulations about the cases of growing networks ( see appendix a ) and correlated networks ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the results are quantitatively the same with slight difference in quantity .",
    "[ 0.9 ] ( color online ) the correlation between degree and strength with different assortative coefficients @xmath67 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 is fixed .",
    "the inset shows the numerically fitting value of @xmath41 vs assortative coefficients .",
    "the networks are generated by the generalized ba algorithm @xcite of size @xmath57 and average degree @xmath58.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , in this model , the resource flow will approach to a kinetic equilibrium , which is determined only by the topology of the networks , so we can predict the weight of a network just from its topology by the equilibrium state . therefore , our proposed mechanism can well apply to estimate the behaviors in many networks .",
    "when given topology of a traffic network , people can easily predict the traffic load in individual nodes and links by using this model , so that this model may be helpful to a better design of traffic networks .    the authors wish to thank miss . ming zhao for writing the c++ programme that can generate the scale - free networks with tunable assortative coefficients . this work has been partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant nos .",
    "70471033 , 10472116 , and 10635040 , the special research founds for theoretical physics frontier problems under grant no .",
    "a0524701 , and specialized program under president funding of chinese academy of science .",
    "since many real networks , such as www and internet , are growing momently .",
    "the performance of the present resource - allocation flow on growing networks is thus of interest .",
    "we have implemented the present dynamical model on the growing scale - free networks following the usual preferential attachment ( pa ) scheme of barabsi - albert @xcite .",
    "since the topological change is independent of the dynamics taking place on it , and the relaxation time before converging to a kinetic equilibrium state is very short ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , if the network size is large enough ( like in this paper @xmath69 ) , then the continued growth of network has only very slight effect on topology and the results is almost the same as those of the ungrowing case shown above .    furthermore , we investigate the possible interplay between the growing mechanism and the resource - allocation dynamics . in this case , the initial network is a few fully connected connected nodes , and the resource is distributed to each node randomly .",
    "then , the present resource - allocation process works following eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and simultaneously , the network itself grows following a strength - pa mechanism instead of the degree - pa mechanism proposed by ba model . that is to say , at each time step , one node is added into the network with @xmath70 edges attaching to the existing nodes with probability proportional to their strengths ( in a growing ba network , the corresponding probability is proportional to their degrees ) .",
    "clearly , under this scenarios , there exists strong interplay between network topology and dynamic .    when the network becomes sufficient large ( @xmath69 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the evolution approaches a stable process with both the degree distribution and strength distribution approximately following the power - law forms .",
    "furthermore , we report the relationship between strength and degree in fig . 7 , which indicate that the power - law scaling , @xmath71 with @xmath42 , also holds even for the growing networks with strong interplay with the resource - allocation dynamics .",
    "note that , the eq .",
    "( 8) is valid under the assumption that the underlying network is uncorrelated . however , many real - life networks exhibit degree - degree correlation in some extent . in this section , we will investigate the case of correlated networks .",
    "the model used in this section is a generalized ba model @xcite : starting from @xmath72 fully connected nodes , then , at each time step , a new node is added to the network and @xmath70 ( @xmath73 ) previously existing nodes are chosen to be connected to it with probability @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath10 denote the choosing probability and degree of node @xmath4 , respectively . by varying the free parameter @xmath76 @xmath77 , one can obtain the scale - free networks with different assortative coefficients @xmath67 ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite for the definition of assortative coefficient ) .",
    "the simulation results are shown in fig .",
    "8 , from which one can find that the power - law correlations between strength and degree in the correlated networks are quantitatively the same as that of the uncorrelated networks , however , the power - law exponents , @xmath41 , are slightly different . actually , in the positive correlated networks , the large - degree nodes prefer to connect with some other large - degree nodes rather than those small - degree nodes , thus there may exist a cluster consisting of large - degree nodes that can hold the majority of resource .",
    "that cluster makes the large - degree nodes having even more resource than in the uncorrelated case , thus leading to a larger @xmath41 . in the inset of fig .",
    "8 , one can find that @xmath41 is larger in the positive correlated networks , and smaller in the negative correlated networks .",
    "however , the analytical solution have not yet achieved when taking into account the degree - degree correlation , which needs a in - depth analysis in the future .",
