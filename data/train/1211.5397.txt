    "at present it is generally recognized that microwave and submillimeter molecular spectra from the interstellar medium provide us with a very sensitive tool to study possible variation of the fundamental constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 on a large space - time scale .",
    "it was shown that certain types of transitions are particularly sensitive to such variations .",
    "the mixed tunneling - rotational transitions in such molecules as h@xmath1o@xmath7 , h@xmath8o@xmath8 , ch@xmath1oh , and ch@xmath1nh@xmath8 can be very sensitive to @xmath4-variation @xcite .",
    "recently the submillimeter spectra of methanol have been used to place very stringent limits on @xmath4-variation on the cosmological timescale @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath9-doublet transitions in such diatomic radicals , as oh and ch are very sensitive to variation of both constants @xcite .",
    "the 18 cm oh line was observed at high redshifts , which allowed to constrain time variation of both constants @xcite . in that work",
    "the 21 cm hyperfine hydrogen line was used as a reference .",
    "this constrain can be further improved if more than one @xmath9-doublet transition in oh , or ch is detected .",
    "a rather general way to look for the enhanced sensitivity to variation of the fundamental constants is to search for the accidental degeneracy of the levels of different nature .",
    "this approach works for very different systems from nuclei , to atoms , and molecules ( see , for example , the review @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to draw attention to the microwave and submillimeter spectra of the linear polyatomic radicals with nonzero electronic angular momentum .",
    "first , these molecules have @xmath10-doublets , which are analogous to the @xmath9-doublets in diatomics .",
    "second , the renner - teller interaction can lead to the anomalously low lying vibronic levels and cause enhanced sensitivities of the mixed ro - vibronic transitions .",
    "finally , there are many linear polyatomic molecules , which are detected in the interstellar medium . in this context one of the most interesting species",
    "is the linear c@xmath1h molecule , where the excited vibronic @xmath11 level lies less than 30 @xmath12 above the ground level @xmath13 and where several mixed transitions were recently measured in the molecular beam experiment @xcite . because of that we focus on this molecule here leaving other similar molecules for a separate discussion .",
    "the interstellar carbon - chain radicals of hydrocarbon series c@xmath14h ( @xmath15 ) exist in linear and cyclic isomeric forms",
    ". both forms are observed in the millimeter - wave range toward dark and translucent molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes of carbon - rich stars @xcite . a typical abundance of the linear radical @xmath16-c@xmath1h ,   the simplest odd carbon chain radical under consideration in the present study ,",
    " is @xmath17 relative to hydrogen .",
    "the cyclic - to - linear abundance ratio [ @xmath18c@xmath1h]/[@xmath16-c@xmath1h ]  @xmath19 in dark clouds @xcite , but decreases to @xmath20 in translucent clouds @xcite , and becomes less than unity around carbon stars @xcite .",
    "the cyclic and linear isomers of c@xmath1h have also been detected in a star - forming region @xcite and in two extragalactic sources : the star - burst galaxy ngc  253 @xcite and the spiral galaxy located in front of the quasar pks  1830211 at the redshift @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath16-c@xmath1h lines have been detected in regions with kinetic temperature ranging from @xmath22  k ( dark clouds ) to several hundred kelvin ( circumstellar envelopes , star - forming regions ) .",
    "the observed line intensities are less or about 0.1  k.    the lines observed from the interstellar medium ( ism ) are doppler broadened , so the linewidth @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the velocity distribution for the ism and @xmath25 is speed of light .",
    "this means that @xmath26 characterizes ism and to a first approximation is independent on the frequency of the transition @xmath27 .",
    "because of that for the astrophysical search of the possible variation of the fundamental constants it is crucial to find transitions with high dimensionless sensitivity coefficients defined as : @xmath28 in the optical waveband these sensitivity coefficients are typically of the order of @xmath29 . in the microwave waveband they are typically of the order of unity , but can be much bigger",
    ". below we will calculate @xmath30 factors for some microwave and submillimeter transitions of the @xmath16-c@xmath1h molecule and show that they can reach the order @xmath31 . as usual such enhanced sensitivities take place for the low frequency transitions between quasi degenerate levels of different nature .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the theory of the renner - teller effect in polyatomic linear molecules @xcite .",
    "the total molecular angular momentum @xmath32 consists of several contributions .",
    "we have the overall rotation of the nuclei @xmath33 .",
    "then we have the vibrational angular momentum @xmath34 associated with the twofold degenerate bending vibration mode(s ) and the electronic angular momentum @xmath35 .",
    "momentum @xmath33 is perpendicular to the molecular axis @xmath36 ; two others have @xmath36 projections @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "we define momentum @xmath37 and its projection @xmath38 . finally , we add electronic spin : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "suppose we have @xmath0 electronic state @xmath41 and @xmath42 vibrational state of a bending mode @xmath43 .",
    "all together there are 4 states @xmath44 .",
    "we can rewrite them as one doublet @xmath45 state @xmath46 and states @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in adiabatic approximation",
    "all four states are degenerate .",
    "@xcite showed that the states with the same quantum number @xmath49 strongly interact , so @xmath47 and @xmath48 states repel from each other , while @xmath45 doublet in the first approximation remains unperturbed .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case when one of the @xmath50 levels is pushed close to the ground state @xmath51 .",
    "this is what takes place in @xmath16-c@xmath1h molecule @xcite .",
    "consider linear polyatomic molecule with unpaired electron in the @xmath52 state in the molecular frame @xmath53 .",
    "obviously , the bending energy is different for bendings in @xmath54 and in @xmath55 planes : @xmath56 ( here @xmath57 is the supplement to the bond angle ) .",
    "that means that the electronic energy depends on the angle @xmath58 between the electron and nuclear planes : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "there is no reason for @xmath61 to be small , so @xmath62 a.u .  and to a first approximation @xmath63",
    "does not depend on @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "as long as interaction depends on the relative angle between electron and vibrational rotation it changes angular quantum numbers as follows : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is exactly what is necessary to produce splitting between @xmath47 and @xmath48 states with @xmath42 as discussed above .",
    "interaction also mixes different vibrational levels with @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we have , for example , the nonzero matrix element ( me ) @xmath67 between states @xmath68 .",
    "such mixings reduce effective value of the quantum number @xmath9 and , therefore , reduce the spin - orbital splitting between @xmath13 and @xmath69 states @xcite , @xmath70    let us define the model more accurately .",
    "following @xcite we write hamiltonian as : @xmath71 here `` electronic '' part @xmath72 includes all degrees of freedom except for the bending vibrational mode and spin . for @xmath16-c@xmath1h",
    "there are two bending modes , but for simplicity we include second bending mode in @xmath72 too .",
    "electronic mes in the @xmath73 basis have the form :    [ ham2 ] @xmath74    here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are vibrational coordinates for the bending mode .",
    "kinetic energy in these coordinates has the form : @xmath75    we can use the basis set of 2d harmonic functions in polar coordinates @xmath76 and @xmath58 for the mass @xmath77 and force constant @xmath78 : @xmath79 it is important that radial functions are orthogonal only for the same @xmath16 : @xmath80 this allows for the nonzero mes between states with different quantum number @xmath16 .",

    "we solved eigenvalue problem for hamiltonian using the basis set of the 2d - harmonic oscillator .",
    "matrix elements were formed according to eq .",
    "( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "as discussed above we neglected one of the bending modes leaving only the one that produces @xmath83 level close to the ground state doublet @xmath84 .",
    "our model hamiltonian has only 3 parameters , namely @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and the dimensionless renner - teller parameter @xmath87 : @xmath88 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the following values were obtained : @xmath89 we fixed the values for @xmath85 and @xmath86 and varied the renner - teller parameter @xmath87 to fit five lowest levels for the given bending mode : @xmath13 , @xmath69 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",

    "( [ rot6 ] ) keeping all other scalings unchanged .",
    "the uncertainty in the scalings of the smaller parameters of the effective hamiltonian may be higher due to the nonadiabatic corrections .",
    "so we did two additional calculations with the scaling of the parameter @xmath136 changed by @xmath419 , i.e. @xmath420 and @xmath421 .",
    "finally , in order to check , how the fitting procedure may affect the results , we did several calculations with slightly different sets of parameters .",
    "for example , we made a 13 parameter fit with three centrifugal corrections set to zero : @xmath422 . in terms of the obtained frequencies ,",
    "such fit is only three times less accurate than our final 16 parametric one .    in tables [ tabq1 - 3 ]  [ tabq7 ] we give the average values of the @xmath30 factors for all calculations , described above .",
    "the errors , given in the brackets , correspond to the maximum deviations from these average values for individual calculations . in most cases",
    "these errors are smaller than , or of the order of 10% , even for the large sensitivities .",
    "this accuracy is sufficient for the analysis of the experimental and observational data .",
    "we have studied sensitivity coefficients to the variation of the fundamental constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the microwave and submillimeter spectra of the linear polyatomic molecule with strong renner - teller interaction . as an example",
    "we have chosen @xmath16-c@xmath1h molecule , which is often observed in the interstellar molecular clouds and recently has been detected at the redshift @xmath21 .",
    "the renner - teller interaction depends on the dimensionless ratio @xmath423 of the force constants in the two perpendicular planes , which include molecular axis .",
    "parameter @xmath87 does not depend on the fundamental constants and vibrational intervals scale in the same way as for harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath424",
    ". however , the renner - teller interaction modifies vibrational spectrum and can lead to the close lying vibrational states .",
    "such states then strongly interact with each other due to the coriolis interaction . as a result",
    ", the molecules with strong renner - teller interaction can have low frequency mixed ro - vibronic transitions with strongly enhanced sensitivity coefficients to the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the @xmath16-c@xmath1h molecule we found several types of transitions with sensitivity coefficients varying in a wide range .",
    "this opens new possibilities to study variation of fundamental constants in astrophysics .",
    "i am grateful to sergei levshakov for bringing @xmath16-c@xmath1h molecule to my attention and for the constant interest to this work .",
