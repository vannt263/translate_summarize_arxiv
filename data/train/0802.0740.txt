    "the flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath4 provide potentially stringent tests of standard model ( sm ) in flavor physics and are not allowed at tree level but are induced by the glashow - iliopoulos - miani ( gim ) amplitudes @xcite at the loop level in the sm . in addition , these are also suppressed in sm due to their dependence on the weak mixing angles of the quark - flavor rotation matrix @xmath5 the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "these two circumstances make the fcnc decays relatively rare and hence important for the study of physics beyond the sm commonly known as new physics .",
    "the experimental observation of inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite decays , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , has prompted a lot of theoretical interest on rare @xmath8 meson decays . though the inclusive decays are theoretically better understood but are extremely difficult to be measured in a hadron mechine , such as the lhc , which is the only collider , except for a super-@xmath8 factory , that could provide enough luminosity for the precise study of the decay distribution of such rare processes .",
    "in contrast , the exclusive decays are easy to detect experimentally but are challanging to calculate theoretically and the difficulty lies in describing the hadronic structure , which provides the main uncertainty in the predictions of exclusive rare decays . in exclusive",
    "@xmath9 decays the long - distance effects in the meson transition amplitude of the effective hamiltonian are encoded in the meson transition form factors which are the scalar functions of the square of momentum transfer and are model dependent quantites .",
    "many exclusive @xmath10@xcite , @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , @xmath13@xcite processes based on @xmath14 have been studied in literature and many fameworks have been applied to the description of meson transition form factors : like constituent quark models , qcd sum rules , lattice qcd , approaches based on heavy quark symmetry and analytical constraints .",
    "rare @xmath8 decay modes also provide imporatant ways to look for physics beyond the sm .",
    "there are various extensions of the sm in the literature , but the models with extra dimensions are of viable interest as they provide a unified framework for gravity and other interactions . in this way",
    "they give some hints on the hierarchy problem and a connection with string theory . among different models of extra dimensions , which differ from one another depending on the number of extra dimensions , the most interesting are the scenario with universal extra dimensions . in these ued models",
    "all the sm fields are allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions and compactification of extra dimension leads to the appearance of kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners of the sm fields in the four dimensional description of higher dimensional theory , together with kk modes without corresponding sm partners .",
    "the appelquist , cheng and dobrescu ( acd ) model @xcite with one universal extra dimension ( ued ) is very attractive because it has only one free parameter with respect to the sm and that is the inverse of compactification radius @xmath2 @xcite .    by analyzing the signature of extra dimenions in the different processes",
    ", one can get bounds to the size of extra dimensions which are different in different models .",
    "these bounds are accessible for the processes already known at the particle accelerators or within the reach of planned future facilities . in case of ued these bounds are more sever and constraints from tevatron run i allow to put the bound @xmath15 gev @xcite .",
    "rare @xmath8 decays can also be used to constraint the acd scenario and in this regard buras and collaborators have already done some work .",
    "in addition to the effective hamiltonian they have calculated for @xmath16 decays and also investigated the impact of ued on the @xmath17 mixing as well as on the ckm unitarity triangle @xcite . due to the availability of precise data on the decays @xmath18 , colangelo et al .",

    "we will study the rare semileptonic decay modes , @xmath20on the same footing as @xmath21 because both are induced by the same quark level transitions , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "we compare results of forward backward asymmetry for @xmath23 using our form factors with those obtained by colangelo @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the comparision shows clear distinction as shown in fig 4 .",
    "these decays may provide us step forward towards the study of existance of new physics beyond the sm and therefore deserve serious attention , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will briefly introduce the acd model .",
    "section 3 deals with the study of effective hamiltonian and the corresponding matrix elements for @xmath20 decay .",
    "now the new physics manifest in these decays in two different ways , either through new operators in the in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm or through new contributions to the wilson coefficients @xcite . in acd",
    "no new operator appears at tree level and therefore the new physics comes only through the wilson coefficients which are calculated in literature @xcite and we will summarize them in the same section . finally , in section 4 we will calculate the decay rate and forward - backward asymmetry and summarize our results .",
    "in our usual universe we have 3 spatial @xmath251 temporal dimensions and if an extra dimension exists and is compactified , fields living in all dimensions would menifest themselves in the @xmath26 space by the appearence of kaluza - klein excitations .",
    "the most pertinent question is whether ordinary fields propagate or not in all extra dimensions .",
    "one obvious possibilty is the propagation of gravity in whole ordinary plus extra dimensional universe , the `` bulk '' .",
    "contrary to this there are the models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) in which all the fields propagate in all available dimensions @xcite and appelquist , cheng and dobrescu model belongs to one of ued scenarios @xcite    this model is the minimal extension of the sm in @xmath27 dimensions , and in literature a simple case @xmath28 is considered @xcite .",
    "the topology for this extra dimension is orbifold @xmath29 , and the coordinate @xmath30 runs from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the the compactification radius .",

    "the fields may be even or odd .",
    "even fields have their correspondent in the @xmath37 dimensional sm and their zero mode in the kk mode expansion can be interpreted as the ordionary sm field .",
    "the odd fields do not have their correspondent in the sm and therefore do not have zero mode in the kk expansion .",
    "the significant features of the acd model are :    * the compactification radius @xmath2 is the only free parameter with respect to sm * no tree level contribution of kk modes in low energy processes ( at scale @xmath38 ) and no production of single kk excitation in ordinary particle interactions is a consequence of conservation of kk parity .",

    "* yukawa terms *    in sm , yukawa coupling of the higgs field to the fermion provides the fermion mass terms .",

    "can not be simultaneously even under @xmath72 .",
    "this makes the acd model to be the minimal flavor violation model , since there are no new opeators beyond those present in the sm and no new phase beyond the ckm phase and the unitarity triangle remains the same as in  sm @xcite . in order to have 4-d mass eigenstates of higher kk levels ,",
