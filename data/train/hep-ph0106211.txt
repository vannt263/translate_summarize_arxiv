    "the radiative decays of @xmath5 mesons are valuable sources of information in low - energy hadron physics in areas such as quark model , su(3 ) symmetry and the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule .",
    "in particular , radiative @xmath5 meson decays @xmath0 and @xmath6 can provide insight on the structure and properties of low - mass scalar resonances , since these decays primarily proceed through processes involving scalar resonances such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the subsequent decays into @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the novosibirsk snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite collaborations recently have reported very accurate results on these decays with the following branching ratios br(@xmath11 , br(@xmath12 @xcite , and br(@xmath13 , br(@xmath14 @xcite , where the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic .",
    "the low - mass scalar mesons with vacuum quantum numbers have fundamental importance in understanding low energy qcd phenomenology and the symmetry breaking mechanisms in qcd .",
    "in addition to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the existence of the scalar - isoscalar @xmath1 meson as a broad @xmath17 resonance , which has long been controversial , seems to be established . increasing number of theoretical and experimental analyzes find a @xmath1-pole position near ( 500-i250 ) mev @xcite .",
    "a direct experimental evidence seems to emerge from @xmath18 decay channel observed by the fermilab ( e791 ) collaboration , where @xmath1 meson is seen as a clear dominant peak with @xmath19=478 mev and @xmath20=324 mev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the nature and the quark substructure of these scalar mesons have not been established yet , whether they are conventional @xmath21 states @xcite , @xmath22 in case of @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath23 in case of @xmath3 and @xmath24 @xcite molecules , or exotic multiquark @xmath25 states @xcite have been a subject of debate .",
    "it has been noted that the radiative decay of @xmath5 meson to the scalar mesons can differentiate among various models of their structure @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay process @xmath0 among other radiative decay processes of the type @xmath26 where v and p belong to the lowest multiplets of vector ( v ) and pseudoscalar ( p ) mesons was studied by fajfer and oakes @xcite using a low energy effective lagrangian approach with gauged wess - zumino terms .",
    "they considered the contributions in which the virtual vector meson states dominate , and obtained the branching ratio for this decay as @xmath27 .",

    "they showed that the one - loop contributions are finite and to this order no counterterms are required . in this approach",
    "the decay @xmath0 proceeds through charged - kaon loop and they obtained the contribution of charged - kaon loops to this decay as @xmath30=224 ev which is much larger than the intermediate vector meson state ( vmd ) contribution due to ozi rule . considering the amplitudes of both vmd and kaon - loop contributions they obtained for the decay rate the value @xmath30=269 ev , moreover they noted that ozi allowed kaon - loops dominate both the photonic spectrum and the decay rate .",
    "radiative decays of @xmath5 meson were also investigated by marco et al .",
    "@xcite employing the techniques of chiral unitary theory developed earlier by oller @xcite . using a chiral unitary approach , they included the final state interactions of two pions by summing the kaon - loops through bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "they obtained the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 as @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , they obtained the photon distribution as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath32 system and compared it with snd data .",
    "they noted that the shape of the experimental spectrum is relatively well reproduced with the @xmath33 contribution since @xmath3 meson is the important scalar resonance appearing in @xmath34 amplitude .",
    "however , they also noted an appreciable strength for a possible @xmath35 contribution in the spectrum .    in this work ,",
    "we follow a phenomenological approach and study the radiative @xmath0 decay by considering @xmath2-pole vector meson dominance amplitude as well as scalar @xmath1-pole and @xmath3-pole amplitudes . by employing the experimental value for this decay rate",

    "however , the mass @xmath88=980 mev of @xmath3-meson is very close to @xmath36 threshold , and this induces a strong energy dependence on the width @xmath89 of @xmath3-meson . in order to take that into account",
    "different expressions for @xmath89 can be used .",
    "a first possibility is to use an energy dependent width for @xmath3 @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the four - momentum square of the virtual @xmath3-meson . in this expression",

    "another and widely accepted possibility is known from the work of flatt @xcite .",
    "this amounts to extending the expression for @xmath94 below the @xmath97 threshold where @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath99 and thus @xmath94 becomes purely imaginary . in our work , we consider both possibilities .    in terms of the invariant amplitude @xmath100(e@xmath101 , e@xmath102)= @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are the invariant amplitudes resulting from the diagrams a , b , and c in fig .",
    "2 respectively , the differential decay probability for @xmath0 for an unpolarized @xmath5-meson at rest is then given as @xmath107 where e@xmath101 and e@xmath102 are the photon and pion energies respectively .",
    "we perform an average over the spin states of @xmath5-meson and a sum over the polarization states of the photon .",
    "the decay width @xmath30 is then obtained by integration @xmath108 where now the factor ( @xmath109 ) is included because of the @xmath110 in the final state .",
    "the minimum photon energy is e@xmath111 and the maximum photon energy is given as @xmath112=474 mev .",
    "the maximum and minimum values for pion energy e@xmath102 are given by @xmath113",
    "the experimental full width of @xmath3 is @xmath89=40 - 100 mev @xcite .",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath4 depends on the value of the width of @xmath3 , in order to estimate its effect on the coupling constant we take this width as @xmath114 mev and @xmath88=980 mev in our calculation .",
    "if we use the form for @xmath94 that was proposed by flatt @xcite , we are not able to reproduce the form of the invariant mass spectrum for the @xmath0 decay . in this case",
    "the enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum appears in the central part rather than around the @xmath3 pole .",
    "a similar problem was also encountered by bramon et al .",
    "@xcite in their study of the role of @xmath16 exchange in the @xmath6 decay . therefore , in the analysis presented below , for @xmath115 we use the form given in eq .",
    "( 14 ) . through the decay rate that results from the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( 13 ) describing @xmath116-vertex we obtain the coupling constant @xmath84 as @xmath84=1.58 . in order to determine the coupling constant @xmath4 , we follow a similar procedure that we used in our previous works where we estimated the coupling constants @xmath117 @xcite and @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "we use the experimental value of the branching ratio for the radiative decay @xmath0 @xcite in our calculation for this decay rate , and this way we arrive at a quadric equation for the coupling constant @xmath4 , the coefficient of the quadratic term resulting from @xmath1 meson contribution shown in fig .",

    "2(b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "therefore our analysis produces for a set of values of @xmath1-meson parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 two values for the coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "we choose for the @xmath1-meson parameters the values @xmath119 mev and @xmath87 mev as suggested by the recent fermilab ( e791 ) experiment @xcite , resulting for the coupling constant @xmath69 in the value @xmath120 using the expression for the decay rate @xmath121 given in eq .",
    "( 10 ) . this way we obtain for the coupling constant",
    "@xmath4 the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we then study the invariant mass distribution for the reaction @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the distribution @xmath124 for the radiative decay @xmath0 in our phenomenological approach choosing the coupling constant @xmath4=0.064 and in fig .",
    "4 we show the same distribution for @xmath4=0.025 as a function of the invariant mass @xmath125 of @xmath32 system . in these figures",
    "we also indicate the contributions coming from the different reactions @xmath61 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 as well as the contribution of the total amplitude which includes the interference terms as well .",
    "the difference between the two total contribution curves is mainly in the interference region @xmath126 gev above which @xmath3-amplitude dominates the spectrum . from the analysis of the spectrum obtained with the coupling constants @xmath4=0.064 and @xmath4=0.025 in figs . 3 and 4 , respectively",
    ", we may decide in favor of the latter value of the coupling constant @xmath4 and we may state that the experimental data within the framework of our phenomenological approach suggest that @xmath123 . in fig .",
    "5 , we show the contributions of different amplitudes and the contributions of the interference terms in interference region @xmath126 gev for @xmath4=0.025 .",
    "on the other hand , the photoproduction of @xmath127-meson on proton targets near threshold can be described at low momentum transfers by single one - meson exchange model .",
    "friman and soyeur @xcite showed that in this picture the @xmath127-meson photoproduction cross - section on protons is given mainly by @xmath1-exchange .",
    "they calculated @xmath128-vertex assuming vector meson dominance of the electromagnetic current , and their result when described using an effective lagrangian for the @xmath128-vertex gives the value @xmath1292.71 for this coupling constant .",
    "later , titov et al .",
    "@xcite in their study of the structure of @xmath5-meson photoproduction amplitude based on one - meson exchange and pomeron - exchange mechanism used the coupling constant @xmath4 which they calculated from the above value of @xmath117 invoking unitary symmetry arguments as @xmath1300.047 .",
    "our result for this coupling constant @xmath123 is not in total agreement with this value .",
    "we note that in order to derive their result titov et al . assumed that @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath24 are members of a unitary nonet .",
    "however , assignments of scalar states into various unitary nanets are not without problems and other possible assignments than used by titov et al .",
    "have also been suggested @xcite . in our work",
    "we do not make any assumption about the quark substructure of @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons and describe their couplings in a phenomenological framework .",
    "n. n. achasov and v. v. gubin @xcite performed a fit to the experimental data and they obtained the following values : the branching ratio with interference @xmath131 , the branching ratio of the signal @xmath132 , the branching ratio of the background @xmath133 . if we use the coupling constant @xmath4=0.025 and @xmath19=478 mev @xmath20=324 mev , we obtain for the branching ratios for different contributing reactions to the radiative decay @xmath0 the values @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and for the total interference term @xmath139(interference)=@xmath140 .",
