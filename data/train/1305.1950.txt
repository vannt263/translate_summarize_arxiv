    "de paris - cnrs / umr8630 , upmc , france + @xmath3 inaf - astronomical observatory of turin , university of turin , italy + @xmath2 imcce - obs . de paris - cnrs / umr8028 , upmc , france e - mail : stefano.bertone@obspm.fr        deep space data processing during the last decade has revealed the presence of anomalies in the form of unexpected accelerations in the trajectory of probes  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis made trying to solve this puzzle can be summarized in two main approaches : whether these anomalies are the manifestation of some new physics  @xcite , or something is mismodeled in the data processing @xcite .",
    "+ we investigate moyer s book  @xcite , which describes the relativistic framework used by space agencies for data processing .",
    "we know that the ephemeris of a space mission is built from subsequent measures involving the light time of a signal traveling between the earth and the probe and the solution of the inverse problem . since the ephemeris is used for both operational ( space probe navigation ) and scientific goals ( measurements for testing fundamental physics ) , a well defined model is then mandatory for both the interpretation of physical data and the orbit reconstruction . in this article",
    ", we suggest an improvement of the light time modeling focusing on the treatment of the so - called `` transponder delay '' .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows .",
    "+ in section 2 , we give a brief overview of light time computation as described by the moyer s book ; we show that the transponder s delay ( i.e. the time delay between the reception and retransmission of the light signal on board the satellite ) is not accurately taken into account in this model",
    ". in section 3 we present an alternative , more precise , modeling . finally , in section 4 , we compare both modelings to highlight their differences and give some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "+ throughout this work we will suppose that space - time is covered by some global barycentric coordinates system @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath7 a time coordinate and @xmath8 .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 , and latin indices from 1 to 3 . here",
    "@xmath9/@xmath10 represents the position / velocity of body @xmath11 at time @xmath7 , where @xmath11 can take the value @xmath12 ( ground station ) or @xmath13 ( spacecraft ) .",
    "primed values are related to the _ moyer s modeling _ , while we will generally use non - primed values for our proposed modeling .",
    "deep space navigation is based on the exchange of light signals between a probe and at least one observing ground station .",
    "the calculation of a coordinate light time , as resumed from  @xcite , is quite simple : a clock starts counting as an uplink signal is emitted from ground at @xmath14 .",
    "the signal is received by the probe at @xmath15 and then , after a short delay , reemitted towards the earth where it is received by a ground station at @xmath16 .",
    "the clock stops counting and gives the round - trip light time @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the shapiro delay  @xcite , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the transponder delay and other corrections ( ex : atmospheric delay ... ) that we will not detail here , respectively .",
    "the light time @xmath22 is then used to compute two physical quantities :    * the _ ranging _ , related to the distance between the probe and the ground station can be computed using @xmath23 * the _ doppler _ , related to the velocity of the probe with respect to the earth , is obtained by differentiating two successive light time measurements , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , during a given count interval @xmath26 .",
    "it has been showed that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a transponder s ratio applied to the downlink signal when it is reemitted towards the earth and @xmath29 .",
    "+ since the _ doppler _ signal results from the differentiation of the _ ranging _ signal , all constant or slowly changing terms like @xmath20 and @xmath21 obviously cancel out in this modeling .",
    "nevertheless , the electronic delay of some microseconds @xmath20 due to on board processing of the incoming signal requires to consider a different position of the spacecraft at reemission time . in the following ,",
    "we study its consequences on light time modeling for _ ranging _ and _ doppler _ calculations .",
    "+ for this purpose , we introduce an improved light time model @xmath30 taking into account four events ( one more with respect to moyer s model ) : the emission from the ground station at @xmath31 , the reception by the probe at @xmath32 , the reemission at @xmath33 and the reception at ground at @xmath34 .",
    "the additional event @xmath35 accounts for this small delay of @xmath20@xmath36@xmath37 @xmath38 ( at least for modern spacecraft ) so that we get @xmath39 similarly to section  [ sec : moyermodel ] , we then use @xmath30 to compute _ ranging _ @xmath40 and _ doppler _ @xmath41 observables as           to compare the two modelings presented in sections  [ sec : moyermodel ] and  [ sec : ourmodel ] , we shall define the difference between the computed light times = -  = t_1 - t_1 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let us then analyze the supplementary event @xmath35 . this term is implicitly related to @xmath20 by the first order development ^sc_3=^sc_2+t ^sc_2 + o ( t^2 ) , the implications of this mismodeling are given by @xmath48 where we used eq .  , eq .   and eq .   into eq .   and defining @xmath49 as the minkowskian direction between the ground station and the probe .",
    "+ equation   highlights the presence of an extra non - constant term , directly proportional to the transponder delay and neglected in moyer s model .",
    "this term also depends on the position and velocity of both the probe and the ground station .",
    "neglecting it would actually lead to a wrong determination of the epoch @xmath50 and to an error in both _ ranging _ and _",
    "doppler_.      in order to evaluate the magnitude of the additional term in eq .",
    ", we computed @xmath51 ( giving the difference between the _ ranging _ calculated with the two models ) and @xmath52 ( related to the difference of the _ doppler _ calculated by the two models ) for the observation of a probe .",
    "we used the real orbit of some probes ( rosetta , near , cassini , galileo ) during their earth flyby , which is a particularly favorable configuration .",
    "we used the naif / spice toolkit  @xcite to retrieve the ephemeris for probes and planets to be used in the computation .",
    "computing eq .   and",
    "it s time derivative for the near probe during its earth flyby on the 23 january 1998 , we found a difference of the order of some @xmath53 for the probe distance @xmath54 calculated by the two models and a difference up to several @xmath55 at the instant of maximum approach for its velocity .",
    "these results are shown in figures  [ fig : range ] and[fig : dop ] .",
    "+ in order to highlight the high variability of the transponder delay effect on doppler measurements , we computed @xmath56 for different probes in different configurations with respect to the observing station .",
    "the results are exposed in figure  [ fig : dop1 ] and show that this delay can not be simply calibrated at the level of light time calculation nor neglected in the _ doppler _ calculation .",
    "it seems obvious from our results that the influence of the transponder delay can not be reduced to a simple calibration without taking some precautions .",
    "it is indeed responsible for a tiny effect on the computation of light time and has an impact on both _ ranging _ and _ doppler _ determination .",
    "we represent it by a more complete modeling , considering four epochs instead of three . in order to test the amplitude and variability of this effect on real data ,",
    "we compute its influence on some real probe - ground station configurations during recent earth flybys ( near , rosetta , cassini and galileo ) .",
    "+ the observables calculated using moyer s model and our improved model show differences of the order of several @xmath53 and of @xmath57 for the _ ranging _ and the _ doppler _ , respectively .",
    "such an error is acceptable for most operational goals at present .",
    "anyway , we shall highlight that this error is directly proportional to the transponder delay and that for past missions , whose data are still largely used for scientific purposes , transponders were more than @xmath58 times slower that today . in the future too , increasing ephemeris precision  @xcite should be followed by the development of faster transponders or by the use of a more precise model .",
