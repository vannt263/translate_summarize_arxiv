    "the past decade has seen a growing interest in the research of stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomena in interdisciplinary fields , involving physics , biology , neuroscience , and information processing .",
    "conventional sr has usually been defined in terms of a metric such as the output signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) being a non - monotonic function of the background noise intensity , in a nonlinear ( static or dynamic ) system driven by a subthreshold periodic input @xcite . for more general inputs , such as non - stationary , stochastic , and broadband signals , adequate sr quantifiers",
    "are information - theoretic measures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , aperiodic sr represents a new form of sr dealing with aperiodic inputs @xcite .",
    "the coupled array of dynamic elements @xcite and spatially extended systems @xcite have been investigated not only for optimal noise intensity but also for optimal coupling strength , leading to the global nonlinear effect of spatiotemporal sr @xcite . by contrast , the parallel uncoupled array of nonlinear systems gives rise to the significant feature that the overall response of the system depends on both subthreshold and suprathreshold inputs . in this way ,",
    "a novel form of sr , termed suprathreshold sr @xcite , attracted much attention in the area of noise - induced information transmissions , where the input signals are suprathreshold for the threshold of static systems or the potential barrier of dynamic systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , for a single bistable system , residual sr ( or aperiodic sr ) effects are observed in the presence of slightly suprathreshold periodic ( or aperiodic ) inputs @xcite .",
    "so far , the measure most frequently employed for conventional ( periodic ) sr is the snr @xcite .",
    "the snr gain defined as the ratio of the output snr over the input snr , also attracts much interest in exploring situations where it can exceed unity @xcite . within the regime of validity of linear response theory ,",
    "it has been repeatedly pointed out that the gain can not exceed unity for a nonlinear system driven by a sinusoidal signal and gaussian white noise @xcite . however , beyond the regime where linear response theory applies , it has been demonstrated that the gain can indeed exceed unity in non - dynamical systems , such as a level - crossing detector @xcite , a static two - threshold nonlinearity @xcite , and parallel arrays of threshold comparators or sensors @xcite , and also in dynamical systems , for instance , a single bistable oscillator @xcite , a non - hysteretic rf superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) loop @xcite , and a global coupled network @xcite .",
    "archetypal over - damped bistable oscillators .",
    "each oscillator is subject to the same noisy signal but independent array noise . in this paper",
    ", we call @xmath0 the input noise and @xmath1 the array noise .",
    "[ fig : one ] ]    a pioneering study of a parallel uncoupled array of bistable oscillators has been performed with a general theory based on linear response theory @xcite , wherein the snr gain is below unity .",
    "recently , casado _ et al _ reported that the snr gain is larger than unity for a mean - field coupled set of noisy bistable subunits driven by subthreshold sinusoids @xcite .",
    "however , each bistable subunit is subject to a _ net _",
    "sinusoidal signal without input noise .",
    "the conditions yielding a snr gain exceeding unity have not been touched upon in a parallel uncoupled array of bistable oscillators , in the presence of either a subthreshold or suprathreshold sinusoid and gaussian white noise . in practice , an initially given noisy input is often met , and a signal processor operating under this condition , with the feature of the snr gain exceeding unity , will be of interest @xcite .",
    "the snr gain has been studied earlier in the less stringent condition of narrowband noise @xcite . in the present paper , we address the more stringent condition of broadband white noise and the snr gain achievable by summing the array output , wherein extra array noise can be tuned to maximize the array snr gain . as",
    "the array size is equal to or larger than two , the array snr gain follows a sr - type function of the array noise intensity .",
    "more interestingly , the regions where the array snr gain can exceed unity for a moderate array size , are demonstrated numerically for both subthreshold and suprathreshold sinusoids . since the array snr gain is amplified as the array size increases from two to infinity",
    ", we can immediately conclude that an infinite parallel array of bistable oscillators has a global maximum array snr gain for a fixed noisy sinusoid .",
    "for an infinite parallel array , a tractable approach is proposed using an array of two bistable oscillators , in view of the functional limit of the autocovariance function @xcite .",
    "we note that , for obtaining the maximum array snr gain , the control of this new class of array sr effect focuses on the addition of array noise , rather than the input noise .",
    "this approach can also overcome a difficult case confronted by the conventional sr method of adding noise .",
    "when the initial input noise intensity is beyond the optimal point corresponding to the sr region of the nonlinear system , the addition of more noise will only worsen the performance of system @xcite .",
    "finally , the optimization of the array snr gain in an infinite array is touched upon by tuning both an array parameter and array noise , and an optimal array parameter is expected to obtain the global maximum array snr gain .",
