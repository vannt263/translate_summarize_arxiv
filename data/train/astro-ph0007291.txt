    "detections of absorption and emission features at high redshifts in optical afterglows of grbs and their host galaxies clearly demonstrate that the grb sources lie at cosmological distances ( e.g. , piran @xcite ; vietri @xcite ) . despite such a great advance , the nature of the grb sources is still unknown .",
    "several currently popular models posit as the energy - releasing event coalescence of two neutron stars ( blinnikov et al .",
    "@xcite ; paczyski @xcite ) , the collapse of a massive star ( woosley @xcite ; paczyski @xcite ) ; or accretion induced collapse of magnetic white dwarfs to neutron stars ( usov @xcite ; yi & blackman @xcite ; ruderman , tao & kluniak @xcite ) . in all these models , fast - rotating compact objects like millisecond pulsars with the surface magnetic field of @xmath2 g may be formed ( usov @xcite ; blackman , yi , & field @xcite ; katz @xcite ; kluniak & ruderman @xcite ; vietri & stella @xcite ; spruit @xcite ; wheeler et al .",
    "the rotation of these objects decelerates on a time scale of seconds , and relativistic strongly magnetized winds ( rsmws ) are generated ( e.g. , usov @xcite ) .",
    "these winds are plausible sources of cosmological grbs . in ",
    "2 we discuss radiation from rsmws .",
    "more than 2500 grbs have been detected by batse .",
    "the large area detectors of batse provided excellent light curves of grbs .",
    "some properties of the light curves expected for grbs in this model are considered and compared with available data in  3 .",
    "our main results are discussed in  4 .",
    "our proposal applies more generally , but , for the sake of concreteness , we consider millisecond pulsars with extremely strong magnetic fields as the sources of rsmws .",
    "the wind outflowing from a such a pulsar is poynting flux@xmath3dominated , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pulsar luminosity in the poynting flux , @xmath6 is its luminosity in both electron - positron pairs and radiation , @xmath7 cm is the radius of the pulsar and @xmath8 is its angular velocity . for typical parameters , @xmath9  s@xmath10 and @xmath11  g , we have @xmath12 erg  s@xmath10 that is about the luminosities of cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters .",
    "the more plausible value of @xmath13 is @xmath14 ( usov 1994 ) .    at @xmath15 erg s@xmath10 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the density of electron - positron pairs near the compact object is so high that the optical depth for radiation is as high as @xmath17 . in this case , the outflowing plasma and radiation are in thermodynamic equilibrium , and the outflowing hot wind may be completely described by @xmath18 and the mass - loss rate in baryons , @xmath19 . the values of @xmath20 , @xmath13 and @xmath19 may be estimated from observational data on grbs ( see below ) .",
    "we identify three possible types of high - frequency emission from rsmws : ( i ) thermal radiation from the wind photosphere , ( ii ) non - thermal radiation generated because of the development of internal wind instabilities ( iii ) non - thermal radiation produced by the interaction between rsmws and an ambient plasma ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .      during outflow ,",
    "the wind plasma accelerates and its density decreases . at the wind photosphere , @xmath21 ,",
    "the optical depth for the bulk of thermal photons is @xmath0 , and these photons propagate freely at @xmath22 . for a spherical electron - positron wind with @xmath23 , the radius of the photosphere and the lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma at this radius",
    "are determined by the condition that the comoving plasma temperature at @xmath24 is @xmath25  k and by the law @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( paczyski @xcite ; usov @xcite ) :    @xmath28    @xmath29    the mean energy of observed photons is @xmath30  mev .    for an optically thick electron - positron wind ,",
    "the thermal luminosity of the wind photosphere , @xmath31 , practically coincides with @xmath18 ( usov @xcite ) .",
    "presence of baryons in rsmws may change the above estimates . if the mass - loss rate in baryons is small ,",
    "@xmath32 , then the baryonic loading of the wind is negligible . for larger mass - loss rates , @xmath33 , the following relations are valid , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( e.g. , paczysky @xcite ) .",
    "these relations and equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yield @xmath37    @xmath38    in this case , the photospheric luminosity is about @xmath18 , similar to a pure electron - positron wind , @xmath39 .",
    "the baryon loading with @xmath40 does not change essentially the mean energy of photons radiated from the wind photosphere .",
    "this is because @xmath41 is @xmath42 while @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for even larger mass - loss rates , @xmath45",
    ", the baryon loading is very important ( paczysky @xcite ) : @xmath46 @xmath47 thus , for @xmath48 the photospheric luminosity and the mean energy of thermal photons decrease rapidly ( @xmath49 ) with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "the main source of energy for non - thermal radiation from rsmws is the magnetic field energy .",
    "rsmws outflowing from the grb progenitors should resemble the winds from rotation - powered neutron stars ( pulsars ) ( coroniti @xcite ; melatos & melrose @xcite ) .",
    "they have two main components : helical and striped magnetic fields ; the striped component alternates in polarity on a scale length of @xmath50 cm . at small distances the magnetic field of the wind",
    "is frozen into the plasma . as the plasma flows out , the plasma density decreases in proportion to @xmath51 reaching a radius @xmath52  cm where it becomes less than the critical charge density ( goldreich - julian density ) required for the magnetic field to be frozen . at @xmath53",
    "the plasma density is not sufficient to screen displacement currents and the striped component of the wind field is transformed into large - amplitude electromagnetic waves ( laemws ) due to the development of magneto - parametric instability ( usov @xcite ) .",
    "the energy of the laemws is , in turn , transfered almost completely to the electron - positron pairs and then to x - ray and @xmath1-ray photons with the typical energy @xmath54 mev ( usov @xcite ; blackman et al .",
    "@xcite ; lyutikov & blackman @xcite ) .    at @xmath55 ,",
    "the magnetic field is helical everywhere in the outflowing wind .",
    "this wind expands more or less freely up to the distance @xmath56  cm at which deceleration of the wind because of its interaction with an interstellar gas becomes important .",
    "it was suggested by mszros and rees ( @xcite ) that at this distance an essential part of the wind energy may be radiated in x - rays and @xmath1-rays .",
    "this suggestion was recently confirmed by numerical simulations ( smolsky & usov @xcite , @xcite ; usov & smolsky @xcite ) . in these simulations",
    "it was shown that at @xmath57 in the process of the rsmw  ambient gas interaction a shock - like radiating layer forms ahead of the wind front and about 20% of the wind energy may be transferred to high - energy electrons of this layer and then to high frequency ( x - ray and @xmath1-ray ) emission .",
    "the fact that in rsmws there are several radiating regions results in a multicomponent structure of grbs .",
    "since the radiating regions are at different distances from the wind source , sub - pulses generated at the different regions are shifted in time with respect to each other . the first sub - pulse that may be observed in the light curve of a grb",
    "is radiated from the wind photosphere .",
    "this sub - pulse looks like a weak precursor of the bulk emission ( c.f .",
    "hansen & lyutikov ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "it is expected that the peak intensity of such a precursors is @xmath58 times smaller than that of the remaining emission .",
    "the precursor has a blackbody - like spectrum , and its duration is about the characteristic time of deceleration of the neutron star rotation @xmath59",
    "s. if the outflow from the millisecond pulsar is non - stationary , the radiation of the precursor may be strongly variable .",
    "the time scale of this variability may be as small as @xmath60  s. this value is a few orders of magnitude less than the pulsar period @xmath61  s. if the angle @xmath62 between the rotational and magnetic axes of the pulsar is non - zero , @xmath63 , the density of the outflowing plasma may be modulated with the pulsar period . in this case",
    "the precursor radiation may be periodical with the pulsar period .",
    "using equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we can see that this periodical variability may be observed even if the mass - loss rate in baryons @xmath19 is as high as @xmath64  s@xmath10 .",
    "hence , observations of both the spectra of grb precursors and their short - time variability can test the grb model .",
    "the second component that may be observed in the light curve of a grb is generated at the distance @xmath65  cm where the striped component of the wind field is transformed into laemws .",
    "for its generation it is necessary that @xmath62 is non - zero .",
    "this component has a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "the time delay between the precursor and the second component is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma at @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is somewhere between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . using this and equations ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , for typical parameters , @xmath71  erg  s@xmath10 , @xmath11  g , @xmath9  s@xmath10 and @xmath72  s@xmath10 , the value of @xmath73 is in the range from one millisecond to a few seconds . in the extreme case when @xmath73 is as small as @xmath74  s , the precursor and the second component practically coincide and",
    "can not be separated from the main components even for the shortest grbs .",
    "the duration of the second component is @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the third component that may be observed in the light curve of a grb is generated at the distance @xmath76  cm where the outflowing wind with a helical magnetic field decelerates due to its interaction with an interstellar gas .",
    "the time delay between the precursor and the third component is @xmath77 .",
    "numerically , we have that @xmath78 is @xmath79  s at @xmath80 and @xmath81  s at @xmath82 .",
    "the grb light curves expected in our model depend on both the angle @xmath62 between the rotational and magnetic axes and the angle @xmath83 between the rotational axis and the sight light .",
    "if @xmath62 is about @xmath84 , almost all the energy of the poynting flux - dominated wind is radiated at the distance @xmath52  cm and transferred to the second component . in this case , the third component is strongly suppressed . on the contrary , if the rotational and magnetic axes are nearly aligned , the third component strongly dominates in grb light curves irrespective of the @xmath83 value . in this case",
    ", only a weak second component may be observed .",
    "such a weak second component may imitate a precursor radiated from the wind photosphere , but its spectrum should be nonthermal",
    ". therefore , the nature of a precursor may be find out only when its spectrum is measured .",
    "in general case , when @xmath62 is somewhere between zero and @xmath84 , both the second and third components with comparable intensities may be seen in grb light curves .    in our model",
    ", the time delay between the precursor and the second component can not be much more than the rise time of the second component .",
    "figure  2a shows the light curve of grb 000508a with a weak precursor that is a plausible candidate to be radiated from the wind photosphere .",
    "for this grb , the bulk of its emission is , most probably , the second component radiated at @xmath85 . in the light curves of many grbs ( grb970411 , grb910522 , grb991216 , grb 000508a , etc . ) , weak precursors separated by long ( @xmath86  s ) background intervals were observed ( see fig .",
    "2b ) . in this case",
    ", the bulk of the grb emission is naturally to identify with the third component .",
    "however , to be sure that a weak first episode in grb light curves is a precursor radiated from the wind photosphere , it is necessary to make sure that its spectrum is nearly blackbody .",
    "this may be done for strongest grbs in near future with glast .",
    "time histories of long grbs often show multiple episodes of emission with the count rate dropping to the background level between adjacent episodes ( e.g. , fishman et al .",
    "@xcite ; fishman & meegan @xcite ; meegan @xcite ) .",
    "this is well consistent with the idea that there are several space - separated regions where the radiation of a grb is produced .",
    "for some grbs , the first episode is rather weak and may be treated as a precursor radiated from the wind photosphere .",
    "we expect that the most ( if not all ) grbs have weak precursors with blackbody - like spectrum .",
    "the peak intensity of a precursor is typically about @xmath87 times less than that of the remaining grb emission .",
    "koshut et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated that @xmath88% of the grbs observed with batse exhibit precursor activity .",
    "however , their definition of precursor activity differs significantly from ours .",
    "indeed , precursor activity was defined by koshut et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as any case in which the first episode has a lower peak intensity than that of the remaining grb emission and is separated from the remaining emission by a background interval that is at least as long as the remaining emission . in our model ,",
    "one of the main observational features of a precursor radiated from the wind photosphere is its blackbody - like spectrum , and it is not necessary for the count rate to drop to a background level at all .",
    "therefore , a weak first episode in the light curve of grb000508a which is slightly ahead of the remaining emission ( see fig .",
    "2a ) is a reasonable candidate to be a precursor in our model while from the definition of koshut et al .",
    "( @xcite ) it follows that grb000508 has no any precursor activity .",
    "however , this does not mean that the fraction of grbs with already observed precursor activity in our conception is higher than @xmath88% .",
    "the reason is that for the main part of grbs discussed in ( koshut et al .",
    "@xcite ) the first episodes have a peak intensity either comparable or only a few times smaller than that of the remaining emission .",
    "such a first episode is , most probably , the second components generated at @xmath85 while the remaining emission is the third components generated at @xmath57 .",
    "we thank norm murray for useful comments .",
