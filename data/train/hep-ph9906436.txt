    "the caldwell plot @xcite of @xmath0 presented at the desy workshop in november 1997 suprized the community .",
    "the results appeared to indicate that we have reached a region in the x and @xmath1 where pqcd was no longer valid .",
    "dglap evolution lead us to expect that @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 would be a monotonic increasing function of @xmath2 , whereas a superficial glance at the data suggests that the logarithmic derivative of @xmath3 deviates from the expected pqcd behaviour , and has a turnover in the region of 2 @xmath4 4 gev@xmath5 ( see fig.1 where the zeus data and the grv94 predictions are shown ) .",
    "opinions were also voiced that the phenomena was connected with the transition from `` hard '' to `` soft '' interactions .    amongst the problems that one faces in attempting to comprehend the data , is the fact that due to kinematic constraints that data is sparse , and each point shown pertains to a different pair of values of x and @xmath1 .",
    "we miss the luxury of having measurements at several different values of x for fixed values of @xmath1 , which would allow one to deduce the detailed behaviour of @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the caldwell plot is in agreement with the pqcd expectations , once screening corrections ( sc ) ( which become more important as one goes to lower values of x and @xmath1 ) , are included . to provide a check of our calculations , we compare with the results one derives using the allm97 parametrization @xcite , which we use as a `` pseudo data base '' .    following the method suggested by levin and ryskin @xcite and mueller @xcite we calculate the sc pertaining to @xmath0 for both the quark and gluon sector . in fig.2",
    "we show the results as well as those of allm compared with the experimental results .",
    "in fig.3 and 4 we display our calculations for the logarithmic derivative of @xmath3 after sc have been incorporated , as well as the allm results . in fig.3 for fixed values of @xmath1 and varying values of x , and in fig.4 for fixed x and varying values of @xmath1 . in fig.4",
    "we show our results as well as those of allm compared with the experimental results .",
    "we note that @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 both in our calculations and in the `` psuedo data '' ( allm ) , remains a @xmath6 increasing function of @xmath2 .    from fig.4",
    "we note that for fixed x , @xmath0 decreases as @xmath1 becomes smaller . the decrease becomes stronger as we go to lower values of x. this phenomena which is due to sc adds to the confusion in interpreting the cadwell plot .",
    "\\1 ) we have obtained a good description of @xmath0 for x @xmath7 0.1 .",
    "\\2 ) at low @xmath1 , @xmath8 both in the pseudo data and in our calculations .",
    "\\3 ) our results suggest that there is a smooth transition between the `` soft '' and `` hard '' processes .",
    "\\4 ) the apparent turn over of @xmath0 is an illusion , created by the experimental limitation in measuring the logarithmic derivative of @xmath3 at particular correlated values of @xmath1 and x.    the detailed calculations and results that this talk was based on appear in @xcite and @xcite",
    "i would like to thank my friends and collegues genya levin and uri maor for an enjoyable and fruitful collaboration ."
