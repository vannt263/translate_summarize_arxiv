    "supercooled and superheated states are ubiqutious in nature , even though they _ can not _ be rigorously derived from _ equilibrium _ statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "their observation is usually justified by appeal to the van der waals loop  in the celebrated van der waals equation for the liquid - gas transition .",
    "the existence of the loop violates the fundamental property that the  partition function ( pf ) be maximized or the free energy be _",
    "convex_. despite this , metastable states appear not only in many other mean - field theories such as the bragg - williams theory @xcite , but can easily be prepared in the  labratory .",
    "there are usually two different mechnism operative in metastable states .",
    "there is usually a fast  mechanism ( time scale @xmath3 ) to create a metastable state in the system , followed by a slow  mechanism ( time scale @xmath4 ) for nucleation of the stable phase and the eventual decay of the metastable state . for the metastable state to exists for a while",
    ", we need to require @xmath5 in approximate theories , the thermodynamic functions for the metastable states are taken as the extrapolation of the functions from the nearby equilibrium states .",
    "however , metastable states in real systems always have time - dependence associated with them .",
    "thus , the metastable state represented by extrapolation can only represent the _ stationary _ limit ( @xmath6 ) of experimentally observed metastable states ; see also @xcite .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the extrapolation is possible only because of the mean - field approximation , and would not be possible in real systems due to a singularity in the thermodynamic functions @xcite .",
    "the presence of the stable phase above some critical size in the metastable state is responsible for the decay of metastable states and for the _ essential singularity _ in the free energy @xcite .",
    "the singularity is absent in mean - field theories or theories with long - range interactions .",
    "accordingly , the existence of sms ( no time - dependence ) is commonly considered a mean - field consequence or due to long - range interactions so that one should not seen sms@xmath7s in real systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "what one observes in experiments are ( time - dependent ) metastable states .",
    "since essential singularities are almost impossibe to detect experimentally , it is not surprising that the extrapolation is possible , at least from the experimentalist s point of view .    in many cases ,",
    "metastable states like supercooled liquids and glasses can remain stable for a long period of times @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with metastability at high temperatures in the liquid - gas transition that do not share this property .",
    "thus , for supercooled liquids , @xmath8  this can be undestood by the high viscosity observed in supercooled liquids , which slows down the growth of the stable phase nuclei .",
    "there is another remarkable difference .",
    "supercooled liquids such as viscous liquids usually do not ( but very well could , as was seen recently @xcite ) exhibit spinodals , while supercooled vapor and superheated liquid invariably do .",
    "rather , viscous liquids undergo a glass transition at low temperatures , about two - thirds of their melting temperature @xmath9 provided the liquid is cooled in a way that crystallization does _ not _ intervene@xmath10 here , the crystal phase ( cr ) represents the more stable phase , and care must be exercised to forbid its nuclei to form while cooling the viscous liquid .",
    "this makes the decay of the metastable state even less probable , and strengthens the inequality @xmath11 thus , it is safe to treat viscous liquids as stationary metastable states ( sms s ) , which can then be described by equilibrium thermodynamics under the _ restriction _ that the crystal phase is not allowed .",
    "it is these sms s that are of interest in this work .",
    "it is the hope that the study of sms will throw some light on the properties of observed metastable states in the form of viscous fluids .",
    "in particular , the extrapolated free energy below the melting temperature can be used to describe supercooled liquids .    however , even if extrapolation is possible , one must still argue that the thermodynamic functions describe the stationary limit of experimentally observed metastable states . under what condition(s ) can one demonstrate this association to be valid ?",
    "[ ptb ]    i5dpgq01.wmf    while there is no rigorous theory of such sms s at present , there are some valuable approaches available in the literature .",
    "one such approach to describe sms  is to use the pl formalism of penrose and lebowitz ( pl ) @xcite using _ restricted ensemble _ method , which we modify and adapt for our case below .",
    "the modification is the following .",
    "the decay of the metastable states ( to the stable state ) in the pl formalism  will be _ completely _ suppressed in order to make them stationary .",
    "thus , nucleation of the stable phase will not be allowed  in our study .",
    "this is consistent with maxwell s idea @xcite that to observe metastable states , we must ensure that the stable phase is not present .",
    "the properties of the sms are what pl call the static or reversible properties @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario for extrapolation is by analytically continuing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix as presented in @xcite , which attempts to accomplish the same as the restricted ensemble does but in a somewhat direct fashion .      in the pl approach ,",
    "only certain microstates out of all are allowed , the prescription of which is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the restricted microstates are used to define a restricted partition function , which is then used to study metastable states .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the curve ohab represents the entropy function @xmath12  for the ordered crystal state , while dh@xmath13ao@xmath13k represents the entropy @xmath14 associated with the disordered liquid state . the entropy as a function of @xmath15 must be thought of as the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite , which must be at its maximum in the equilibrium state . since",
    "a sms is not an equilibrium state in the unrestricted ensemble , its entropy at some @xmath15 _ can not _ exceed the entropy of the corresponding equilibrium state at the same @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that at lower energies , the ordered state must have higher entropy , while at higher energies the disordered state must have higher entropy . on the other hand , if a time - dependent metastable state is prepared under the constraint that the stable phase is not allowed , then the entropy function of such a metastable state will be represented schematically by fg .",
    "the three free energies corresponding to the above entropy functions are shown in the inset .",
    "a consequence of the entropy maximization principle noted above is that the free energy @xmath16 of sms  _ can not _ be lower than the free energy @xmath17 of cr at the same temperature @xmath18 this explains the form of the free energy in the inset .",
    "the slope of the tangent line hh@xmath19 gives the inverse melting temperature , while the slope of the tangent line oo@xmath20gives the inverse temperature at which the free energy do@xmath13ck in the inset is equal to the free energy of the crystal phase at absolute zero  ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the slope of the entropy at k is shown to be finite , as opposed to the infinite slope at o. this point will be discussed further below .    the question that naturally arises is whether the above extrapolation is possible .",
    "it should also be noted that the extrapolation of the free energy does not guarantee that metastable states associated with this extension exist in the model .",
    "this will become clear in the following .",
    "thus , the other important issue is to understand the condition under which the extrapolation will represent the stationary limit of the metastable states that might be observed . to answer these questions , we borrow ideas from both approaches mentioned above and develop an approach , which is then tested by considering a 1-dimensional lattice model .",
    "this model has only nearest - neighbor interactions , and is solved exactly by the use of the transfer matrix .",
    "we find that the extrapolation can be carried out without any ambiguity to describe stationary metastable states ( sms ) in this case .",
    "thus , stationary metastability can exist even in non - mean - field theories and without long - range interactions , which is our main result .",
    "we further show that the extrapolation yields a thermodynamically stable sms free energy , at least mathematically ( see below for details ) , all the way down to absolute zero@xmath10 however , the continuation can not represent any metastable state at very low temperatures when the entropy becomes negative , and must be stopped . at this point ,",
    "the continuation must be replaced by what is conventionally called an ideal glass ; see below .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with the termination of a metastable state in a spinodal .",
    "the point where the entropy vanishes is not a spinodal .",
    "we assume the _ existence _ of sms s , so that the partition function ( pf ) formalism can be applied .",
    "the need for the assumption is easy to understand . at present , our understanding of whether equilibrium ( lowest free energy ) states can be demonstrated to exist mathematically even in simple models is too limited . we should recall that the existence of equilibrium states is taken for granted as a _ postulate _ in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , where it is well known that it is extremely hard to prove their existence .",
    "we quote huang @xcite@xmath22 statistical mechanics , however , does not describe how a system approaches equilibrium , nor does it determine whether a system can ever be found to be in equilibrium .",
    "it merely states what the equilibrium situation is for a given system .",
    "ruelle @xcite notes that equilibrium states are defined _ operationally _ by assuming that the state of an isolated system tends to an equilibrium state as time tends to + @xmath23 whether a real system actually approaches this state can not be answered .",
    "the problem becomes more complicated for sms s like supercooled liquids in which , at least at low temperatures , the relaxation becomes very sluggish and it is highly likely that the appropriate relaxation time @xmath3 indeed tends to + @xmath23 in other words , such an sms may not even be observed in a finite amount of time , even though associated time - dependent metastable states can certainly be observed . even in this case , the study of the long - time limit of metastable states still has a predictive value , and can be carried out using the statistical mechanical formalism .      for the microstates to exist in nature",
    ", it is evident that @xmath24 the number of microstates of energy @xmath25 must satisfy the _ _ reality condition__@xmath26 [ so that the entropy @xmath27 even in the restricted ensemble .",
    "however , a state with _ negative entropy _ can emerge under extrapolations of the free energy . if it happens that the extrapolation results in a negative @xmath28 at low temperatures , this will indicate that the extrapolation no longer represents real microstates , and the system could not be found in those microstates in nature .",
    "there are two @xmath29 aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics .",
    "the first one is the requirement of _ stability _ according to which thermodynamic quantities like the heat capacity , the compressibility , etc .",
    "must never be negative . the other aspect , independent of the stability criteria , is the _ reality _ condition that ensures that such states occur in nature @xcite . the mathematical extension of the free energy of the disordered phase , while always satisfying the stability criteria everywhere ( @xmath30 ) , need not satisfy the reality condition , as our example will show below .",
    "we consider a system composed of @xmath31 particles confined in a given volume @xmath32 and at a given temperature @xmath33 .",
    "the canonical pf is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is over all possible values of the energy , @xmath36 is the number of microstates of energy @xmath15 @xcite , and @xmath37 @xmath33 being the system temperature in the units of the boltzmann constant @xmath38 we do not explicitly show the volume - dependence .",
    "we also introduce the  adimensional free energy ( without the conventional minus sign ) @xmath39 for microstates to exist in nature , @xmath40 ; hence the corresponding entropy @xmath41  @xmath42 .",
    "whether this remain true for the analytic continuation remains to be seen .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is obtained by taking @xmath43 and @xmath32 @xmath44 keeping @xmath45 fixed .",
    "the limit is taken by considering the sequence formed by @xmath46 for different values of @xmath31 as @xmath47 the volume must be changed according to @xmath48 for proper thermodynamics , the limit of the sequences must exist , which we assume and denote it by @xmath49 the corresponding helmholtz free energy is @xmath50    in the following , we will usually suppress the index @xmath31 on various quantities , unless necessary .",
    "we assume the existence of an equilibrium crystal , which has its energy @xmath51 at @xmath52  it also has the lowest free energy at low temperatures . since @xmath53 is an allowed energy@xmath54 we must surely have @xmath55 assuming @xmath56 as @xmath57 , which is always true according to the nernst s postulate , we recognize that @xmath53 represents not only the helmholtz free energy but also the energy of the perfect cr at @xmath21 . since @xmath58 is non - negative , @xmath59 is a sum of positive terms . as a consequence ,",
    "the following two principles of equilibrium are always satisfied .      * _ maximization principle _ the pf @xmath59 must be _ maximized _ in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath60 corresponds to picking out the maximum term @xmath61 in ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "this maximum term corresponds to @xmath62 * _ stability principle _ the heat capacity , which is given by the fluctuations in the energy is non - negative .    it should be stressed that the non - negativity of the heat capacity and the maximization principle only require the _ positivity _ of @xmath58 ( @xmath63 @xmath58 @xmath64 is not required@xmath10 thus , both principles remain valid even if the entropy becomes negative @xcite .",
    "the above principles of equilibrium and reality are two _ independent _ aspects .",
    "this observation is going to be useful when we discuss the metastable states below .",

    "most probably , @xmath97 does not continue all the way down to @xmath113 .",
    "if it did , the energy of the disordered phase at absolute zero would be @xmath53 ( we assume that @xmath114 as @xmath57)@xmath54 the same as that of cr .",
    "this would most certainly imply that they would coexist at @xmath21 , each having the same volume ; recall that we are considering a fixed volume ensemble@xmath10  while there is no thermodynamic argument against it , it does not seem to be the case normally .",

    "let us consider the disordered pf@xmath7s . for temperatures",
    "so that the average energies @xmath139 and @xmath140 are greater than @xmath115 both partition functions are determined by the microstates of energies above @xmath115 where the starred and unstarred @xmath141s are identical .",
    "hence , for @xmath142 the two pf@xmath7s @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the same so that their free energies are the same .",
    "they differ only below @xmath145 while @xmath143 exists there , @xmath146 does not .",

    "therefore , the corresponding free energies satisfy the two equilibrium conditions noted above .",
    "consequently , even the restricted and extended restricted pf@xmath7s will never give rise to unstable states .",

    "we consider the case when there is only one phase transition , the first - order melting transition , in the system .",
    "the following point is to be noted as discussed by penrose and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "the resticted pf@xmath7s defined in ( [ pfalpha0 ] ) and ( [ pfalpha1 ] ) require that we add an extra energy term in the energy of the system , which takes the value 0 if the microstate belongs to the set @xmath161 , and + @xmath162 if it does not .",
    "this meets the pl criterion for `` static '' metastable states .",
    "the other two criteria that pl  require relate to the decay of metastable states , and does not have to be imposed here anymore .",
    "thus , the problem of two incompatible requirements discussed by penrose and lebowitz @xcite no longer is an issue .    a prescription to describe metastability using the pf  formalism can now be formulated .",
    "we _ abandon _ the above global maximization principle , and use @xmath71 to give the free energy of the metastable disordered phase ( supercooled liquid ) below @xmath67 and  @xmath73 to give the metastable ( superheated crystal ) state free energy above @xmath163 similarly , @xmath164 @xmath165 and @xmath166 @xmath165 give the entropy and energy per particle for the supercooled liquid and superheated crystal , respectively .",
    "there are two possibilities for the extrapolation of the free energy .",
    "as said above , unstable states are not possible in the restricted ensemble .",
    "thus , either the free energy terminates in a spinodal at a non - zero but finite temperature , or it extrapolates to @xmath21 through @xmath167 for the supercooled liquid ( @xmath168 through @xmath169 for the superheated crystal ) . in this work ,",
    "we are only interested in the supercooled liquid .",
    "it is easy to calculate the order parameter @xmath170 for @xmath171 for the `` disordered phase '' by using @xmath143 to check if we have properly identified the set of disordered microstates above . since all microstates in @xmath97 contain only nuclei of the stable cr  phase of finite sizes , the argument of fisher @xcite about the origin of an essential singularity no longer works , which requires nuclei of all sizes , including infinitely large sizes",

    "are given by @xmath239 which are needed to calculate the entropy per site of the polymer system @xmath240 the superscript is to indicate that it is the polymer system entropy , and is different from the spin system entropy @xmath241 if we define @xmath206 without the last term in ( [ axisfe ] ) , then @xmath242 and @xmath243  must be replaced by @xmath244 and @xmath245 respectively .",
    "this will not affect any of the conclusions below .    in the following",
    ", we will be only interested in the polymer entropy .",
    "the proper stability requirements for the polymer system are @xmath246 as can easily be seen from ( [ axispf ] ) , and must be satisfied even for sms .",
    "they replace the positivity of the heat capacity of the spin system , which no longer represents a physical spin system for @xmath217 @xmath2 it is easy to see from the definition of @xmath247 that @xmath248 need not be positive , even if the conditions in ( [ polystbl ] ) are satisfied .",
    "let us compute @xmath206  as @xmath249 ( @xmath250 for the two eigenvalues @xmath211 and @xmath219 . from ( [ density ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath251 for both states as @xmath252 thus , using @xmath253 we have @xmath254 this means that if the eigenvalue @xmath211 is taken to represent the metastable phase above @xmath255 , its osmotic pressure must become equal to that of the equilibrium phase ( described by the eigenvalue @xmath219 ) at absolute zero .",
    "this is in conformiity with theorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath71 to represent the sms  osmotic pressure below @xmath256 we have also checked that @xmath257 as @xmath252     we will only discuss the disordered polymer phase below for @xmath217 @xmath258 .",
    "it is easily checked that the above stability conditions in ( [ polystbl ] ) are always satisfied for @xmath259 see , for example , the behavior of @xmath260 in fig . 2 , where we have taken @xmath261 and @xmath262 . since the high - temperature disordered phase represents a physical system , it can not give rise to a negative entropy @xmath247 above @xmath222 ; however , its metastable extension violates the reality principle as shown in fig .",
    "2 , where its entropy @xmath247 becomes negative below @xmath263 which is lower than the transition temperature @xmath256    we now make an important observation . as @xmath1 decreases ( below 1 ) , both @xmath183 and @xmath222 ( @xmath264 move down towards zero simultaneously .",
    "as @xmath232 the equilibrium ordered phase corresponding to @xmath219  disappear completely , and the disordered phase corresponding to @xmath211 becomes the equilibrium phase . there is no transition to any other state .",
    "thus , there is no metastability anymore .",
    "consequently , there is _ no _ ideal glass transition since there is _ no _ other state more ordered than this state any more , as argued above .",
    "thus , our exact calculation confirms our earlier conclusion that the existence of an ordered state is crucial for the existence of the entropy crisis . the existence of an ordered state sets the zero of the temperature scale by its minimum energy @xmath53 .",
    "this scale then sets the temperature @xmath183 of the lowest sms energy @xmath265 to be positive .",
    "we also observe that there is no singularity in @xmath211 or @xmath71 at @xmath222 , even though there is a phase transition there .  similarly , there is no singularity in @xmath266 or @xmath73 at @xmath256  thus , the thermodynamic singularity in the equilibrium free energy does not necessarily create a singularity in @xmath71 or @xmath73 at @xmath267 as was discussed earlier .",
    "the existence of a singularity or spinodal at some other temperature is a different matter .",
    "the transition between sms and the ideal glass is not brought about by any thermodynamic singularity at @xmath145 rather , it is _ imposed _ by the reality requirement .",
    "the ideal glass state does _ not _ explicitly emerge as a new phase in the calculation since it is a disordered phase defined by the order parameter @xmath69 . in this sense , the transition to the ideal glass is a very special kind of transition , which does not seem to belong to the class of phase transitions in which various phases emerge in the calculation .    the exact calculation , which is not mean - field calculation in principle , in the previous section demonstrates the existence of sms .",
    "thus , it demonstrates that our hypothesis of sms existence is not vacuous .",
    "it also shows that the free energy can be extrapolated below the melting temperature by the use of the restricted pf , and that there is no essential singularity , a signature of a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the free energy remains stable all the way down to absolute zero .",
    "however , the mere existence of the stable extrapolated free energy all the way down to @xmath268 does not mean that it represents the free energy of a realizable metastable state .",
    "this becomes evident when we consider the entropy of the extrapolated free energy .",
    "this entropy drops rapidly , and goes through zero at @xmath269 and becomes negative as the temperature is reduced .",
    "a genuine entropy crisis appears in the sms below @xmath183 . at @xmath270 which is higher than the cr free energy @xmath53 at @xmath110 below @xmath271",
    "the extrapolated free energy can not represent any real metsatable state and must be replaced by another free energy branch , which is constant :  @xmath272 for @xmath273 it is shown by the dotted horizontal straight line at k in the inset.this branch represents the free energy of the ideal glass ( ig ) , which is the phase below @xmath274 we need to invoke an ideal glass transition at this temperature in the model .",
    "the energy of the ideal glass is @xmath275this means that the ideal glass has a higher energy than the crystal at absolute zero , in conformity with the experiments .",
    "the entropy crisis occurs only in the metastable state , and not in the equilibrium state , even though we have not shown this explicitly here .",
    "the entropy of the latter vanishes at @xmath53 with an infinite slope , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . thus , the lowest energy @xmath53 determines the lowest allowed temperature @xmath21 in the system , which is consistent with the nernst - planck postulate .",
    "however , it is possible that the equilibrium free energy becomes horizontal , so that the entropy vanishes , over a non - zero temperature range @xmath278 where the system is frozen@xmath10 such a situation happens , for example , in the kdp model and gives rise to a singularity at @xmath279 this should be contrasted with the existence of the ideal glass transition in the supercooled state , where its appearance is not accompanied by any singularity in the sms free energy . replacing the unphysical sms free energy below @xmath183 by a frozen state is done by hand ; it does not emerge as part of the calculation . indeed",
    ", as our calculation has shown , the ideal glass transition disappears as @xmath280 in this limit , @xmath281 thus , the `` ordered '' state corresponding to @xmath282 disappears , and the disordered phase remains the equilibrium state all the way down to @xmath52 thus , it is safe to conclude that equilibrium state in any system will _ never _ show an entropy crisis ( at a positive temperature ) .",
    "if any exact calculation for the free energy or the entropy predicts an entropy crisis at a positive temperature , this will necessarily imply that there must exist another state , the equilibrium state , for which no entropy crisis should exist .",
    "this observation has been crucial in a recent investigation of a dimer model @xcite in which the disordered phase underwent a first - order transition to an equilibrium ordered phase .",
    "the ordered phase then gave rise to an entropy crisis at a lower temperature , which forced us to look for another equilibrium state , which was eventually discovered above the temperature where the entropy crisis was found , so that the crisis occurred in a metastable state ( this time emerging form an intermediate ordered state ) .",
    "similar situation occured in more complex systems containing particles of different shapes and sizes @xcite .",
    "the stability criteria such as a non - negative heat capacity that immediately follow from the pf  formulation are independent of the non - negative entropy requirement .",
    "thus , it is possible for the sms to have a negative entropy over some temperature range .",
    "this will only means that such states are not observable in nature .",
    "it is well known that in classical statistical mechanics , the entropy in continuum space can become negative .",
    "this is true of the ideal gas at low temperatures . from the exact solution of the classical tonks gas of rods in one dimension",
    ", one also finds that the entropy becomes negative at high coverage .",
    "thus , either quantum mechanics is needed or a lattice structure is needed to replace the continuum spapce to make entropy positive .",
    "we assume here that this has been done and that the entropy for realizable microstates can not be negative ."
