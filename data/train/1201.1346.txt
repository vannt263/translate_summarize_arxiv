    "the recent discovery of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) with weak fields @xcite has again raised problems related to magnetic field evolution in isolated neutron stars .",
    "the activity of magnetars with sgrs and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) has been believed to be powered by the decay of ultrastrong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "their surface dipole field , which is observationally inferred from the spin period and its time derivative , typically exceeds electron quantum magnetic field @xmath0 g .",
    "the field strength of sgr0418 + 5729 is , however , relatively weak at @xmath1g@xcite .",
    "the critical boundary between magnetars and radio pulsars has thus become less clear , and magnetars are not sufficiently characterized by their dipole field strength alone .",
    "their activity may be explained by hidden magnetic fields such as poloidal components with higher - order multipoles or internal toroidal components . in either case",
    ", the field strength should be greater than @xmath2-@xmath3 g , since other energy sources are insufficient ( see , for example , the review by ) .",
    "the importance of hall drift on the magnetic evolution of neutron stars was pointed out before evidence of the existence of magnetars was available @xcite .",
    "the effect , which depends on the field strength , becomes more important in strong regimes where @xmath4 g .",
    "furthermore , hall drift may induce instability under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "the effect has been considered in analytic treatments , and as plane - parallel slab geometry .",
    "these studies are useful to understand some aspects of the mechanism , but nonlinear numerical analysis is also required to examine the behavior in more realistic stars .",
    "several simulations have also been performed , assuming that the fields are located in the spherical crust region of a neutron star . in particular , @xcite extensively studied the effect in a crust with uniform conductivity and density , and subsequently extended the discussion to stratified stellar models . also calculated the evolution in a realistic stratified model with a thermal history .",
    "these numerical calculations are based on spectral or quasi - spectral methods , for example expanding angular functions using spherical harmonics .",
    "limitations of such an approach are discussed therein .",
    "for example , evolution of a purely toroidal field forms a steep gradient that can not be calculated .",
    "a recent promising approach is using a finite difference scheme to examine the nonlinear evolution of the hall instability in a 2d slab .",
    "each numerical scheme has advantages and disadvantages , so multiple complementary approaches are needed .    in this paper , we calculate magnetic field evolution using a finite difference scheme to understand nonlinear hall drift dynamics .",
    "the model is simplified by assuming an axisymmetric magnetic field located in a crust with uniform conductivity and electron number density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model and its assumptions are described .",
    "magnetic field evolution is governed by an induction equation with nonlinear hall drift term .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions and initial configurations are also discussed .",
    "sections 3 and 4 give numerical results for two distinct initial configurations .",
    "one condition is a purely toroidal field in which the poloidal part is always zero if it is exactly zero at the initial state .",
    "this is in contrast to a purely poloidal initial case , for which the toroidal part is inevitably induced .",
    "the evolution of a purely toroidal field is furthermore of interest , due to the similarity to burgers equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite study the problem in a stratified plane - parallel slab , which corresponds to small - scale dynamics much smaller than the stellar radius .",
    "the results clarify the local mechanism , but our concern is global aspects",

    "this problem is numerically studied in section 3 .",

    "magnetohydrodynamics simulation shows that dynamically stable configurations are such mixed ones , in which poloidal and toroidal field strengths are of the same order .",
    "there is little known about the initial configuration of neutron stars in particular , the location , topology , and field strength .",
    "if both components coexist , their strengths are likely to be similar .",

    "the minor component is highly affected by the poloidal one , but is almost neglected in the dynamics of the whole system .",
    "no consequence of the toroidal field comes from the fast decay rate @xmath169 in the amplitude as seen in section 4 , or from the initial small strength .",
    "figure 7 shows the results of an evolution in which the toroidal component is dominated at the initial state .",
    "compared with the decay curve of total energy in fig .",
    "6 , the damping is much faster . most of the magnetic energy is initially stored in the toroidal part , but rapidly decays .",
    "the poloidal component decays rather slowly , and dominates at the later time .",
    "the higher multipole moments are induced and have larger amplitudes than those of fig .",
    "the overall dipole decay curve is nonetheless very similar to that of the large poloidal case .",
    "figure 8 shows the results for large a magnetization parameter @xmath117 and an initially large poloidal field .",
    "the evolution of the total energy is very similar to that of fig .",
    "6 , although the oscillatory behavior in the toroidal energy is evident .",
    "the timescale determined by the hall drift is approximately 1/5 that of fig .",
    "6 , in which @xmath164 . the oscillatory behavior is also clear in the coefficients @xmath66 and helicity @xmath103 .",
    "however , except for the initial wavy structure seen in the hall drift timescale , the decay of the dipole field is similar to that of fig . 6 .",
    "the dominant component , the polar dipole , is thus not affected by the toroidal field , which never plays an important role because of its rapid decay .    figure 9 shows the results for a large magnetization parameter @xmath117 and an initially large toroidal field . in this case , a large amount of energy is transferred from the toroidal to poloidal components .",
    "higher multipoles in the poloidal field are induced around @xmath170 .",
    "the configuration of the poloidal field at this time is significantly distorted as in the second panel in fig .",
    "the toroidal energy becomes much smaller than the poloidal energy around @xmath171 , and both components are subsequently decoupled .",
    "after that , the dipole field evolution is determined by free decay . despite the disorder at @xmath170 ,",
    "the amplitude of the free decay phase , for example at @xmath172 , does not differ so much from that of figs .",

    "numerical simulations demonstrate how the hall drift changes the current and magnetic configuration . in a purely toroidal evolution ,",
    "ohmic dissipation is enhanced by accumulated currents elsewhere .",
    "the spatial location depends on the initial data , but the energy dissipation rate does not so significantly depend on the accumulation position in our uniform conductivity model . in a realistic case the conductivity will decrease with the radius ,",
    "so most of the magnetic energy may be effectively dissipated near the surface .",
    "the results become more sensitive to the initial condition .",
    "energy is , in principle , transferred between poloidal and toroidal components if both are initially involved .",
    "it is important for understanding the evolution that the free decay rate of the polar dipole is the least .",
    "when the polar dipole dominates , it is rarely affected by the toroidal field , which rapidly decays . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant amount of energy is transferred to the poloidal field until almost equipartition when the toroidal component is initially dominant .",
    "global nonlinear coupling is manifest in the hall drift timescale only when the corresponding energies are of the same order .",
    "moreover , the poloidal field at the surface and the exterior is highly distorted , and is no longer described by a pure dipole field . during this phase , the dipole is not a good indicator of overall field strength . in a longer ohmic dissipation timescale the toroidal field decays rapidly , so the coupling vanishes .",
    "the polar dipole eventually survives .",
    "the early evolution highly depends on the choice of the initial data , i.e , the configuration and strength . as discussed by , stationary conditions in the presence of hall drift for an axisymmetric magnetic field",
    "means that the isosurface of @xmath26 coincides with that of @xmath25 ; in other words , @xmath174 , for which the coupling term @xmath175 vanishes .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in the whole shell region .",
    "the outer boundary condition requires that the toroidal component is concentrated in the interior ( @xmath53 ) , whereas the poloidal one may leak out to the exterior , meaning that @xmath176 at the surface .",
    "the interior poloidal field is described by the value at the surface if the topology is simply connected .",
    "the condition @xmath177 therefore means that @xmath53 everywhere , irrespective of @xmath25 .",
    "our numerical calculation starts with an initial configuration different from the ` hall equilibrium ' , and shows the behavior to the state @xmath53 .",
    "it may be necessary as a next step to study plausible initial configurations , since little known about them .",
    "the timescale is less accurate in our simplified model with uniform density and conductivity .",
    "realistic models are necessary , but the distributions depend on equation of state and neutron star mass . assuming that our uniform model is obtained as a result of spatial average of a certain model with stratified number density and conductivity , the timescale is estimated .",
    "the overall normalization constant @xmath178 is given by @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182 years , where @xmath183 is an averaged value of the conductivity .",
    "the decay timescale of the dipole is @xmath184 years , and that of the toroidal one is @xmath185 years .",
    "these numbers are slightly larger , since the crust size in our present model is thick , @xmath186 .",
    "the timescale is proportional to @xmath187 , so that the actual values may be smaller by a factor of @xmath188@xmath189 .",
    "a typical decay timescale is around @xmath190@xmath191 years .",
    "the characteristic age of the low - field magnetar sgr0418 + 5729 is more than @xmath192 years @xcite .",
    "the dipole field ( @xmath1 g ) may decay or survive within this period .",
    "however , the internal toroidal field is likely to dissipate more quickly .",
    "it is therefore difficult to understand why the toroidal field has a much larger field strength , @xmath193-@xmath194 g , which is required for the activity .",
    "one possible explanation is that current age estimates are inaccurate .",
    "the characteristic age is normally estimated by assuming a constant dipole magnetic field .",
    "the hall drift significantly affects the surface value , especially at the initial epoch with strong field . as demonstrated in the second panel of fig .",
    "4 , the surface field is highly distorted from the pure dipole .",
    "sgr0418 + 5729 may correspond to a young phase of oscillatory evolution in which the surface dipole temporarily decreases , but there is a strong internal toroidal component .",
