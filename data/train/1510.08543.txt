    "one of the biggest challenges in micromagnetic modeling@xcite is a proper treatment of the dipolar coupling . due to the long - range character of this interaction , an accurate evaluation of the corresponding energy",
    "is a notoriously expensive computational task even for finite systems .",
    "the problem becomes more severe when periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are used . in this case , a supercell is introduced which is repeated infinitely many times along one , two , or three directions forming an infinite system .",
    "a magnetic moment inside the supercell interacts not only with other magnetic moments inside the supercell but also with magnetic moments inside all periodic images of the supercell .",
    "early solution to the problem involved neglecting the interaction beyond some cutoff radius.@xcite similar idea is employed in the more recently proposed macrogeometry method.@xcite another approach is based on the lorenz cavity concept.@xcite many authors evaluated the dipolar interactions using the convolution theorem and fast fourier transform ( fft ) method.@xcite for an infinite range of interactions , however , the convolution theorem is not valid and errors may be expected when magnetization varies rapidly in space.@xcite for one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) pbc it was shown that the dipolar interactions can be accurately evaluated by using analytical formulas for large distances.@xcite this method , however , has not been extended to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case .",
    "the most natural approach for calculations of the long - range interaction with pbc is based on the ewald summation.@xcite however , this technique is rarely used in micromagnetic simulations .",

    "hard - soft magnetic nanocomposites , also called exchange spring magnets , are a promising class of materials with potential applications in permanent magnetism@xcite and magnetic recording.@xcite addition of a high - magnetization soft phase ( sp ) to a high - anisotropy hard phase ( hp ) is expected to increase the remanence of the system at the expense of the coercivity . however ,",
    "if the size of the sp is sufficiently small , the coercivity decrease is only mild resulting in an enhancement of the energy product of the system.@xcite thus , hard - soft nanocomposites are candidates for a new generation of permanent magnets.@xcite on the other hand , reduction of the coercivity in exchange spring magnets is a desirable feature for magnetic recording applications as it allows for lower writing fields without compromising the thermal stability.@xcite    in this paper we introduce a micromagnetic approach for magnetic hysteresis modeling in systems with 1d , 2d , and 3d pbc .",
    "the dipolar interactions are efficiently evaluated using the ewald summation technique .",
    "the method was applied to study magnetic hysteresis of hard - soft nanocomposites with different geometries .",
    "we pay a special attention to layered structures with an out - of - plane hp easy axis . for such systems",
    "it was demonstrated that the sp magnetization tilt away from the hard phase magnetization direction in order to avoid formation of magnetic charges at the interface.@xcite here , we investigate this effect in details by varying the hp spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this allows us to control the strength of the interfacial magnetic charges .",
    "we demonstrate that the sp tilting competes with the interface exchange coupling ( iec ) which favors the perfect alignment of the hp and sp magnetizations . as a results ,",
    "the hysteretic properties show a strong dependence on the iec , provided the spontaneous magnetization for the hp is significantly smaller than for the sp .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the optimal sp size for which the maximum energy product is the largest .",
    "micromagnetic methodology is described in section ii .",
    "section iii provides a basic background on hard - soft magnetic nanocomposites .",
    "the simulation results for layered and core - shell geometries are presented and discussed in section iv .",

    "micromagnetic methodology can be derived using a coarse - grained procedure which averages out the atomic structure of the system and represents it by a collection of micromagnetic blocks , see fig .",
    "[ mblocks ] .",
    "each micromagnetic block contains many atoms whose magnetic moments are assumed to be parallel to each other .",
    "therefore , the size of the micromagnetic blocks must be smaller than the length scale of characteristic magnetic inhomogeneities in the system .",
    "the latter is characterized by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bloch domain wall width and @xmath2 is the exchange length .",
    "here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the exchange stiffness constant , the anisotropy density constant , and spontaneous magnetization , respectively . for majority of magnets",
    "@xmath6 is of the order of a few nanometers@xcite which sets the limit for the micromagnetic block size .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that even if the block size is smaller than @xmath6 , errors are expected in the description of topological defects such as bloch points .",
    "additionally , the method breaks down at temperatures close to the curie point where short - wavelength thermal fluctuations play a significant role . in this case , the fully atomic description is necessary , although an approach based on the landau - lifshitz - bloch equation is an interesting alternative.@xcite    the shape of the micromagnetic blocks is arbitrary and can be chosen according to the problem of interest .",
    "in addition , both the size and shape of the blocks can vary across the system . in this work , however , we choose all blocks to be cubes with the side length @xmath7 . note that while this choice requires the system to have a cuboidal shape , more complicated geometries may still be studied by introducing vacuum micromagnetic blocks .",
    "we choose the coordinate system to be aligned with the cuboid axes .",

    "different types of boundary conditions can be adapted . in the case of open boundary conditions",
    "the system is surrounded by a vacuum allowing the study of an actual magnetic sample .",
    "however , samples of interest often exceed the size limits that are computationally feasible when using micromagnetic calculations . in such cases ,",
    "a common approach is to consider only a smaller system representing a characteristic microstructure of the magnetic sample . here ,",
    "the open boundary conditions introduce artificial surface effects complicating the interpretation of the results . in order to remove the surface effects one can use pbc . in this case ,",
    "a supercell is introduced which is repeated infinitely many times along one , two , or three directions forming an infinite system .",
    "our approach treats the open boundary conditions as well as 1d , 2d , and 3d pbc on equal footing . in the case of 3d pbc ,",
    "the system is assumed to be in a closed circuit environment so that there is no macroscopic demagnetization field .",
    "we point out , however , that it does not lead to any loss of generality since the hysteresis loop can be appropriately rescaled to take into account any demagnetization field .",
    "the direction of atomic magnetic moments inside a micromagnetic block is described by a unit vector @xmath11 called a block spin ( the subscript @xmath12 denotes the position of the block ) .",
    "the set of all block spins @xmath13 fully specifies the magnetic state of the system .",
    "the magnetic energy depends on the block spin configuration and it consists of four terms    @xmath14    here @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denote zeeman , anisotropy , exchange , and dipolar contributions to energy , respectively .",
    "the zeeman energy describes the interaction of magnetic moments with an external magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) and can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 n / a@xmath22 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath23 is the micromagnetic block volume , and @xmath24 is the spontaneous magnetization for the block @xmath12 .",
    "the anisotropy energy describes the preference of magnetic moments to point along their easy axis .",
    "we consider a second - order uniaxial expression given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the anisotropy constant density of the block @xmath12 and @xmath27 is the unit vector along its easy axis .",
    "more general forms of the anisotropy energy can be easily implemented .",
    "the exchange energy favors neighboring magnetic moments to be aligned .",
    "it is given by the heisenberg formula    @xmath28    here the summation is over the nearest neighbor blocks and @xmath29 is the exchange coupling .",
    "implementation of pbc for the exchange energy is rather trivial since the interaction is short - ranged .",
    "the dipolar energy corresponds to the magnetostatic interaction between classical dipoles and is given by    @xmath30    where the prime excludes from the summation the self - interaction term @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the dipolar tensor with cartesian elements given by    @xmath33    here @xmath10 and @xmath34 is the component of a vector pointing from @xmath12 to @xmath35 in units of @xmath7 . due to long - range character of dipolar interactions ,",
    "this contribution to the energy should be treated with special care in the presence of pbc . indeed , while in eq .",
    "( [ dipolar ] ) we can choose the index @xmath12 to run over micromagnetic blocks in the supercell , the index @xmath35 then runs over the blocks inside the supercell and all its periodic images .",

    "we evaluate the effective dipolar tensor using the ewald summation technique.@xcite for 3d pbc the application of this technique to the dipolar systems is well known.@xcite the basic idea is to add for each micromagnetic block a gaussian magnetic charge distribution corresponding to the dipole moments exactly opposite to the original point - like dipole of the block . these gaussian dipoles screen the resulting dipolar interaction making it short - ranged so that the corresponding summation ( [ diptensorpbc ] ) can be straightforwardly done . the extra field from the smooth gaussian magnetic charge density",
    "can then be easily evaluated in the fourier space and subtracted .",
    "the generalizations of the ewald technique to the system with 2d and 1d pbc were described in refs . for the case of electrostatic interactions .",
    "the application of the ewald method for evaluation of the effective dipolar tensor @xmath42 is presented in the appendix .",

    "( [ dipolar2 ] ) or the dipolar contribution to the effective field ( last term in eq .",
    "( [ heff2 ] ) ) can be very time consuming for large systems .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) can be used in such cases to save a considerable amount of time .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the zero - padding technique needs to be applied along the directions with no pbc .",
    "the time evolution of block spins is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath8 is the gilbert damping factor , and @xmath45 is the effective field defined as    @xmath46    using eqs .",

    "the first term in eq . ( [ llg ] ) describes the precession of the block spins around their effective field direction while the second term is responsible for relaxation of the block spins towards the local or global energy minima .",

    "these parameters are often obtained from experimental data . in particular , for each constituent , @xmath55 and @xmath26 can be estimated from the magnetization measurements for the corresponding bulk material.@xcite in the case of the exchange coupling @xmath56 , as long as the blocks @xmath12 and @xmath35 are made of the same material , it can be related to the exchange stiffness of this material ( @xmath57 ) using @xmath58 .",
    "the exchange stiffness can be then obtained from neutron diffraction data using the equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the measured spin wave stiffness , @xmath61 is the land g - factor , and @xmath62 is the bohr magneton .",

    "when the blocks @xmath12 and @xmath35 are made of different materials , the estimation of @xmath56 is very challenging . therefore , the iec is usually assumed to be some kind of average of bulk exchanges or it is treated as a free parameter .",
    "alternatively , the micromagnetic parameters can be evaluated from first principles electronic structure calculations within a general multiscale scheme for hysteresis",

    "in particular , the iec can be explicitly evaluated.@xcite such calculations , however , are often very expensive . in addition , the accuracy of first principles methods may be currently not sufficient for certain classes of materials including important for permanent magnetism rare - earth intermetalics .",
    "the basic physics of exchange spring magnets can be explained using 1d micromagnetic models for hard - soft layered structures.@xcite the key length scale is the hp domain wall width,@xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the exchange stiffness constant and the anisotropy density constant of the hp , respectively .",

    "the corresponding maximum energy product can be as high as 1 mj / m@xmath76 , thus , making nanocomposites in this regime ideal for permanent magnet applications .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath77 we are in the exchange spring regime . here",
    ", the soft layer remains roughly parallel to the hard layer for reverse fields smaller than the nucleation field , which assuming a rigid hard layer can be written as@xcite    @xmath78    the first term is the anisotropy field of the sp , while the second accounts for the exchange field from the hard layer.@xcite once the reverse field exceeds @xmath79 , a domain wall - like magnetic structure develops inside the soft layer . here",
    ", the magnetic moments continuously rotate toward the direction of the external field with the rotation angle increasing as the distance from the hard layers increases ( see fig . [ exchangespring ] ) .",
    "the corresponding demagnetization curve has a convex shape and is fully reversible so that when the external field is removed the magnetization of the soft layer rotates back into alignment with the hp in analogy with the behavior of a mechanical spring .",
    "further increase of the reverse field results in an increase of the rotation angles inside the soft layer until the depinning field is reached at which the domain wall propagates into the hard layer and the magnetization switches .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath80 both layers are essentially decoupled .",
    "the soft layer switches irreversibly at a low reverse field @xmath81 creating a domain wall at each interface . on the other hand , the hard layer remains roughly intact until the reverse field is strong enough to reverse its magnetization .",
    "this reversal field , however , is not equal to the hard layer anisotropy field @xmath82 , but it is the depinning field at which the domain wall at the interface starts to propagate inside the hard layer . assuming infinitely thick hard and soft layers , the depinning field was derived to be@xcite        @xmath83    in the special case of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 the above formula simplifies to@xcite @xmath87 demonstrating a coercivity decrease of a hard magnet due to an interface with the soft material .",
    "note that a nonzero @xmath75 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 all lead to further reduction of the depinning field .",
    "the above expression for the depinning field was found to be a good approximation as long as the interfacial domain walls fit inside each layer which makes eq .",
    "( [ depin ] ) applicable even in the exchange spring regime.@xcite    the above discussion is applicable for hard - soft layered magnets with an in - plane anisotropy axis . in the case of the out - of - plane anisotropy axis there is another complication due to magnetic moments having components normal to the interface .",
    "this is due to magnetization discontinuity between the hard and soft layers leading to the creation of magnetic charges at the interface .",
    "the resulting stray field can be approximately taken into account by introducing effective anisotropy constants@xcite    @xmath90    where the second term is the stray field energy contribution .",
    "note that for a soft layer with small @xmath75 the effective anisotropy constant may become negative resulting in a reversal starting already in the first quadrant of the hysteresis loop .",
    "the role of the iec between the hard and soft materials was also studied.@xcite it was demonstrated that the reduction of the iec resulted in the decrease of the soft layer thickness for which hysteretic behavior changes from a rigid magnet to the exchange - spring regime.@xcite in the exchange - spring regime the nucleation field increases with iec , but the dependence is rather weak unless the iec is an order of magnitude lower than the bulk exchange.@xcite on the other hand , the depinning field increases as the iec decreases .",
    "similarly as for the nucleation field , however , the dependence is strong only when iec is significantly smaller from the bulk exchange.@xcite    experimental realization of hard - soft magnetic nanocomposites requires control of the sp dimension at the nanometer scale .",

    "subsequently , a number of hard - soft nanostructured magnets were produced@xcite using various methods including melt - spinning , mechanical alloying , and nanoparticle self - assembly .",
    "the bulk exchange spring magnets , however , tend to be isotropic .",
    "consequently , while their measured energy products are improved over corresponding isotropic single - phase magnets , they are smaller than the values obtained for corresponding oriented single - phase magnets .",
    "therefore , much of the experimental focus was on thin film systems where the crystallographic texture can be controlled more easily.@xcite in particular , the energy product enhancement as compared to the corresponding oriented single - phase magnets have been reported for fept(l1@xmath94)/fe - pt(fcc),@xcite smco@xmath95/fe,@xcite and nd@xmath91fe@xmath92b / feco@xcite nanocomposite films .",
    "while the simple 1d micromagnetic models capture basic physics of exchange - spring systems , they can not provide a quantitative description of real magnets .",
    "in particular , the predicted energy products@xcite are significantly larger than the experimental values .",

    "a number of calculations have been performed for different exchange - spring magnet systems@xcite in particular , it was demonstrated that permanent magnet properties of hard - soft nanocomposites are reduced as compared to the prediction of 1d micromagnetic models due to several mechanisms including grain misorientation , grain shape irregularity , and dipolar interaction induced magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "3d micromagnetic simulations result in a stronger dependence of the hysteretic properties on the iec as compared to the 1d micromagnetic models.@xcite however , it was argued that such dependence is an artifact of the micromagnetic approach which underestimates the exchange energy associated with the large changes of magnetization at the interface.@xcite in fact , the multiscale model which explicitly treats the interfacial atomic structure yields results very similar to the 1d models.@xcite",
