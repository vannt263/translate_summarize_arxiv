    "the search for quark hadron phase transition and the investigation of the properties of quark gluon plasma stand among the most challenging as well as rewarding pursuits of high energy nuclear physics today .",
    "the observations of jet - quenching  @xcite and the elliptic flow  @xcite , and the success of the partonic recombination  @xcite as a model for hadronization in recent experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven presage the shift of the focus to even more interesting questions about how the plasma is formed and how does it evolve .",
    "it is expected that the quantum statistical interference between identical particles emitted from the relativistic heavy ion collisions will provide valuable inputs for these investigations .",
    "the pion intensity interferometry experiments have however thrown up some startling questions , which need to be answered before we can address these issues .",
    "the hydrodynamics models which have traditionally provided a quantitative description to data on particle spectra and elliptic flow , fail to explain the near identity of the so - called outward and side - ward radii seen in these experiments and invariably lead to outward radii which are up to a factor of 2 larger than the side - ward radii  @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the structure and dimensions of the source in terms of photon interferometry should provide a more direct and valuable insight into these questions .",
    "the advantages of using photons for such studies is well known  @xcite ; they interact only weakly with the system after their production and are free from such distorting effects as the re - scattering  @xcite and coulomb interactions , which have dogged these investigations using identical hadrons .",
    "photons are also emitted at every stage of the collision dynamics and from every point in the system- and not only from the freeze - out surface .",
    "we note though that some studies have postulated that pions may be emitted not only from the surface as normally assumed ; they also escape the system continuously from all points in the system  @xcite with some escape probability .",
    "a large probability for this will however be hard to justify , as the pions do interact strongly with the hadroinc medium .",
    "still this possibility along with the modifications introduced due to final state interactions for hadrons , necessitates a great deal of further study before the radii obtained from the intensity interferometry of hadrons are used to get the spatial and temporal extent of the source in these collisions .",
    "theoretical investigations of the nature of the photon correlation function for relativistic heavy collisions , where a quark - gluon plasma may be formed have been carried out by several authors  @xcite .",
    "an experimental measurement is a far more difficult proposition though , due to the huge back - ground of decay photons and a considerably smaller production of direct photons .",
    "thus , so far only one experiment at cyclotron energies  @xcite ( where direct photons mostly originate from bremsstrahlung of protons against neutrons ) , and a measurement by the wa98 collaboration  @xcite ( where photons originate from hadronic reactions and possibly quark matter ) for the central collision of lead nuclei at cern sps have been reported .",
    "it is expected that such experiments will have a higher possibility of success at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "firstly , the larger initial temperatures expected there will lead to a larger production of direct photons .",
    "secondly , a large suppression of high momentum pions due to the onset of jet - quenching will lead to a reduction in the back - ground from the decay photons . furthermore , a large production of photons having high @xmath1 is expected from the pre - equilibrium stage of the collision  @xcite , which can be reliably crafted using the parton cascade model  @xcite and it has been shown to have a very distinct distribution of the source  @xcite .",
    "the early theoretical investigations  @xcite of photon interferometry were also aimed at isolating photons coming from the quark matter from those coming from the hadronic matter .",
    "these studies concentrated on photons having high transverse momenta ( @xmath2 1 gev ) , which are more likely to be emitted from the early hot and dense phase of the plasma .    in the present work we focus our attention on the photons having low and intermediate @xmath0 100 mev",
    "the photons at the lower end of the @xmath1 range considered would have a dominant contribution from the late stages of the hadronic phase .",
    "this should reveal a source which is strongly affected by the radial flow . the higher end of the @xmath1 should have a leading contribution from the early hot and dense stage of the plasma , when the flow is still small and the temperature is large .",
    "we also incorporate several improvements over the early exploratory works  @xcite .",
    "firstly , we use the complete leading order results for the production of photons from the quark matter  @xcite , which has important contributions from the bremsstrahlung , and annihilation of off - shell quarks  @xcite . secondly , for hadronic reactions we use the state of the art results from turbide et al .",
    "@xcite along with inclusion of hadronic form - factors at the vortexes , incorporating strange mesons .",
    "the dominant hadronic bremsstrahlung process ( @xmath3 ) is included  @xcite for low @xmath1 photons and double counting via @xmath4 and @xmath5 avoided by limiting the contributions of the latter two processes to @xmath6 500 mev .",
    "this should be adequate till a more detailed and complete calculation is available .",
    "finally , we use a much richer equation of state for the hadronic matter , with the inclusion of all the particles in the particle data book , having @xmath7 2.5 gev .",
    "results of our model calculations are compared with the recent data obtained by the wa98 experiment and predictions given for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we shall see that the competition between the cooling due to expansion and the blue - shift of the photon spectra due to transverse expansion give rise to a unique @xmath1 dependence of the outward and side - ward correlation radii , which evolves rapidly as the initial temperature of the system changes , as we go from sps to rhic to lhc .",
    "we first discuss the tools necessary for the analysis of the intensity interferometry and briefly discuss the initial state and the rate of production of photons .",
    "next we check whether the description used by us provides a reasonable description of the single photon spectra measured at .",
    "the results for some typical momenta of the photons and transverse momentum dependence of correlation radii are discussed next .",
    "finally we give our conclusions .",
    "the spin averaged intensity correlation between two photons with momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , emitted from a completely chaotic source , is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the space - time emission function , and @xmath12    in a hydrodynamics calculation , the space - time emission function @xmath13 is replaced by the rate of production of photon @xmath14 , in the hadronic or the quark matter , as discussed earlier .",
    "the results for the correlation function @xmath15 are best discussed in terms of the so - called outward , side - ward , and longitudinal momentum differences .",
    "thus for the four - momentum @xmath16 of the @xmath17th photon , we have , @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath1 is the transverse momentum , @xmath20 is the rapidity , and @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle . defining the difference and the average of the transverse momenta , @xmath22 we can write  @xcite , @xmath23 the corresponding radii",
    "are obtained by approximating : @xmath24 \\label{actual}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that for this choice of parametrization for the correlation function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the average is performed over the distribution @xmath29 .",
    "a one dimensional analysis of the correlation function @xmath30 is some - times performed in terms of the invariant momentum difference @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{one_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however the significance of the corresponding radius does not have a clear meaning  @xcite , and it is also not useful for comparing results obtained using different particles .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is also occasionally used for a one dimensional analysis  @xcite , and one writes : @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{one_2}\\ ] ] note also that @xmath35 .    here",
    ", it is useful to realize that in actual studies of photon interferometry the correlation function @xmath30 would be parametrized as : @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a measure of single ( s ) vs. decay photons ( d ) , under the assumption that the source is completely chaotic .",
    "obviously the later do not contribute to the correlation ( the life - time of @xmath38 is @xmath39 seconds ) and thus : @xmath40 so that @xmath41 and therefore using the measured values of the total photon yield ( @xmath42 ) at the momentum @xmath43 , we can get the yield of single photons from the intercept of @xmath30 on the @xmath20-axis ( peressounko  @xcite ) .",
    "this can provide a check on the results on single photon obtained by , say , a subtraction of photons from decay of pions and etas .",
    "it is important to realize that this procedure is not directly applicable to the case where only a one - dimensional analysis in terms of @xmath44 ( eq.[one_1 ] ) is performed .",
    "the photon - pairs having transverse momenta in some bin around @xmath45 , rapidity difference within @xmath46 , and azimuthal angle difference within @xmath47 will lead to a range of outward , side - ward , and longitudinal momentum differences which will decide the actual correlation function @xmath30 ( eq.[actual ] ) .",
    "even a given value of @xmath44 will admit a range of these momentum - differences , and thus the value of one - dimensional @xmath30 will be obtained by taking an average over the corresponding results .",
    "this will lead to an effective @xmath37 which will not reduce to unity , even if there were no decay - photons  @xcite .",
    "this `` effective '' @xmath37 , as well as the @xmath48 will depend upon @xmath45 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the correlation radii , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "thus the direct photon yield can be measured only by assigning a value to these radii and becomes model dependent .",
    "of - course , @xmath48 can be assigned , though its meaning remains unclear and it remains model dependent .",
    "a simple instance should exemplify this issue . consider a case where @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that @xmath550 ( see eq.([q_l]-[q_s ] ) ) . in this case @xmath56 , but @xmath57 0 .",
    "thus the `` true '' correlation function ( eq.[actual ] ) will be decided by the value of the outward momentum difference and the outward correlation radius , while naively one would expect the one dimensional correlation function ( eq.[one_1 ] ) , to reduce to 1.5 .",
    "thus even for a case when there are no decay photons , we would need a correction factor to account for the range of values admitted by the `` true '' correlation function .",
    "the procedure may however still work for the one - dimensional analysis in terms of the variable @xmath58 ( eq.[one_2 ] ) , as this vanishes only when all the three momentum - differences , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 also vanish simultaneously .",
    "the meaning of the corresponding radius and its relation to the outward , side - ward and longitudinal correlation radii , remains unclear though .    while we are discussing the merits of the one dimensional analysis in terms of the invariant momentum difference , @xmath44",
    ", we recall that for typical cases , the correlation function @xmath30 differs substantially from unity for momentum differences @xmath62 0.2 gev . for studies using single photons this limit",
    "has to be less than @xmath63 , to stay clear of the @xmath38 peak .",
    "if @xmath64 are large , choosing @xmath46 and @xmath47 as small , we can get very small values of the side - ward , outward , and longitudinal momentum differences .",
    "however as @xmath65 , small values for @xmath44 can be obtained only if @xmath64 are quite small . for larger value of @xmath64",
    ", the necessary @xmath46 and @xmath47 bins would be too small to admit meaningful statistics .",
    "thus , it is no wonder that both the photon interferometry experiments reported in the literature so far  @xcite , use the one - dimensional analysis in terms of @xmath44 and utilize photons having very low @xmath1 .",
    "we hope that a much larger statistics expected at rhic and lhc will help us get over this problem by providing results for the full 3-dimensional correlation function .",
    "we very briefly recall the treatment for the space - time evolution of the system and the production mechanism of the photons in these calculations .",
    "for the first set of calculations , we consider central collision of lead nuclei , corresponding to the conditions realized at the cern sps .",
    "we further assume that a thermally and chemically equilibrated quark - gluon plasma is produced in such collisions at the initial time @xmath66 , and use the assumption of is - entropic expansion to estimate the initial temperature , @xmath67 .",
    "thus we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the transverse area of the system , @xmath70 is the particle rapidity density , and @xmath71 for a plasma of massless quarks ( u , d , and s ) and gluons .",
    "the number of flavours for this purpose is taken as @xmath72 2.5 to account for the mass of the strange quarks .",
    "we further assume a rapid thermalization of the plasma , constrained by the uncertainty relation , @xmath73 .",
    "the initial energy density is taken as proportional to the `` wounded - nucleon '' distribution , appropriate for sps energies .",
    "the quark - hadron phase transition is assumed to take place at 180 mev , and the freeze - out at 100 mev .",
    "the relevant hydrodynamic equations are solved under the assumption of boost - invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric transverse expansion using the procedure discussed earlier  @xcite and integration performed over the history of evolution .",
    "this procedure is known to give an accurate description of hadronic spectra  @xcite .",
    "we have already indicated the sources for evaluation of rates of photon production from quark and hadronic matter .    as a first step we plot the rate of production of single photons due to all the reactions among mesons considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at @xmath74 180 mev .",
    "we see that the inclusion of the form factor considerably reduces the rate for production of photons having higher energies , leaving the results for the lowest energy photons unaltered .",
    "we also give the results for the rates from quark matter at the same temperature .",
    "it should be remembered that photon intensity interferometry should be less sensitive to the specific details of the rates of production from quark and hadronic matter , but should depend on their relative strengths .    in order to uniquely establish the importance of the mandatory requirement of including the form - factors discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we plot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) the sum of the production of thermal photons from the quark matter and the hadronic matter in a collision of lead nuclei at the cern sps , with the initial conditions discussed earlier .",
    "the data obtained by the wa98 experiments  @xcite and the production from the quark - matter are also shown for a comparison .",
    "we immediately note that the exclusion of the form - factors will considerably overestimate the production of single photons at higher @xmath1 , as it is well established from several studies that up to half of the single photons measured by the wa98 experiment have their origin in the prompt - qcd process , which should be added to the thermal photons to get a quantitative description of the production of the single photons .",
    "we further note that the calculations underestimate the data by a factor of 7  9 at the lowest @xmath1 reported recently  @xcite ( see discussion later ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show our results for the production of single photons , by summing the thermal contributions ( with the inclusion of form - factors while estimating the hadronic rates ) and the prompt - qcd contribution . for the",
    "later we use a parametrization of all the @xmath75 data  @xcite and scale it for collision of lead nuclei .",
    "we account for the intrinsic @xmath1 of the partons by multiplying this scaled @xmath75 contribution by a factor of 2 .",
    "we see that the sum of the thermal and prompt contributions provides a satisfactory explanation of the single photon spectrum at large @xmath1 in the present model .",
    "we also note that while an inclusion of the pionic bremsstrahlung improves the description of the data at the lower @xmath1 marginally , the theoretical calculations are still well below the estimated ( see later ) experimental results .",
    "we can think of two possible reasons for this shortfall .",
    "one possibility is that there may be additional reactions , e.g. , involving baryons , which may contribute at low @xmath1 . the other , and possibly more plausible ,",
    "reason could be the neglect of the pionic chemical potential  @xcite in the present work , and which can arise arise to - wards the end of hadronic phase  @xcite .",
    "let us elaborate on this aspect .",
    "recall that the pion - chemical potential ( @xmath76 ) may reach a value of about 60 mev in collision of lead nuclei at sps energies@xcite when @xmath77 drops to 100 mev .",
    "this will imply an enhancement in the rate of production of photons from the hadronic matter by approximately a factor of @xmath78 for every pion in the entrance channel , and also some increase due to bose enhancement factor in the exit channel , if there is a pion there .",
    "these aspects are under investigation .",
    "we may add however that the inclusion of these corrections should not drastically alter the following results , as the hadronic phase contributions , already dominate the yield of photons at low @xmath1 , considerably .",
    "the calculations at rhic and lhc energies are performed in an analogous manner , taking @xmath70 at @xmath79 as 1260 and 5625  @xcite respectively for central collisions of gold ( at rhic ) and lead ( at lhc ) nuclei .",
    "this procedure has been discussed repeatedly in literature ; the only difference we have in the present work is that we use the state of the art results for the rates , and a more complete equation of state for the hadronic matter .      as a first step ,",
    "let us investigate the differences in the patterns of the intensity interferometry of photons having high and low @xmath1 .",
    "thus we perform calculations by choosing @xmath64 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 of photons such that two of the three momentum differences , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , vanish in turn .",
    "this theoretical construction helps us obtain the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "we show typical results for @xmath82 0.15 gev , 1.05 gev , and 1.95 gev in fig .",
    "we see a very interesting feature in the outward correlation function : as the transverse momentum of the photon increases , we see a clear emergence of two sources , one which has a smaller correlation radius ( see larger @xmath59 ) and the other which has a larger correlation radius .",
    "this aspect has remained a recurring theme in results for photon intensity interferometry  @xcite and has its origin in the emissions from quark and the hadronic phases respectively which have vastly differing source dimensions .",
    "it is interesting that this feature noted in early exploratory studies has survived the vast improvements in the rate calculations and the dynamics of evolution .",
    "the emergence of the two source structure at larger @xmath1 is facilitated by the decreasing contribution of the hadronic phase there .",
    "this feature is not expected for pion intensity correlations as they leave the system mostly at the time of freeze - out only .",
    "the side - ward correlations show a decreasing radial dimension as @xmath1 increases , as expected for a transversely expanding source , and look gaussian in nature .",
    "the longitudinal correlation function also shows a similar behaviour , as far as the variation of the correlation radius is concerned , however it is definitely not gaussian in form .",
    "thus neither the function ( eq.[actual ] ) describes these variations satisfactorily , nor does the procedure of taking @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the momentum difference where @xmath85 has dropped by a factor of @xmath86 compared to its value at @xmath87 , can do a full justice to these distributions .    in view of the above ,",
    "we have numerically evaluated : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and plotted it as a function of @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 variation of the @xmath50 reveals a very rich structure . in order to fully appreciate the observations , we recall that the source of photons has a dependence @xmath91 where @xmath92 2 , and @xmath93 is the energy of the photons in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "this is very distinct from the corresponding dependence for pions , which varies as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the freeze - out temperature and contributions accrue from locations along the freeze - out surface .",
    "the `` reclining chair '' behaviour seen in this variation is an outcome of competition between a high temperature ( limited to small radii and early times ) and a large transverse flow velocity ( predominant at large radii and late times ) in producing photons having moderate @xmath1 .",
    "thus the large radial flow ensures that photons having a large @xmath1 can also be produced at later times , thus enhancing the so - called duration of the source measured as @xmath96 .",
    "we shall see later that the the ` seat ' of this `` reclining chair '' gets narrower for rhic energies and vanishes at lhc energies , as the increasing radial flow rapidly cools the system .",
    "a hint of this behaviour is also present in the momentum dependence of the side - ward correlation radius , which decreases almost linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the longitudinal correlation radius is completely different from the @xmath97 expected for pions  @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath52 for photons is almost inversely proportional to the transverse momentum .",
    "we believe that these differences do arise due to the difference in the source function for photons and pions .",
    "let us now look at our results for the one - dimensional analysis of the correlation function in terms of the invariant momentum difference @xmath44 corresponding to the transverse momentum , and rapidity window used in the wa98 experiment  @xcite .",
    "our results with all the kinematic cuts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in order to simulate the probabilistic selection of photons ,",
    "we first generated a sufficiently large number of photons according to the thermal distribution calculated by us earlier , in the transverse momentum window of @xmath98 $ ] gev , and ( randomly ) distributed them uniformly over the azimuthal directions and the rapidity window corresponding to the experiment .",
    "next we sampled pairs so that their average transverse momentum @xmath45 was in the appropriate window . the correlation function",
    "was then calculated using the expression eq.([def ] ) .",
    "the results were then averaged by binning in @xmath44 .",
    "we see that our results are described to a reasonable accuracy by the form : @xmath99 \\label{fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 6.5 fm for @xmath101 gev and 5.3 fm for the transverse momentum window @xmath102 gev . in order to compare our results with the numbers quoted",
    "the wa98 experiment  @xcite we need to multiply their results with @xmath103 as the fits discussed in that work do not include the factor of 2 in the exponential used in the present work ( eq.[one_1 ] ) .",
    "thus the corresponding experimental results for the @xmath48 obtained by the wa98 experiment are 8.34 @xmath104 1.7 fm and 8.63 @xmath104 2.0 fm , respectively . while our predictions are in reasonable agreement with the `` experimental '' findings ( within the errors ) , the experimental results are on the larger side .",
    "before passing a judgment on our results , recall that that the values quoted by the wa98 experiment are obtained by assigning a values of 7.85 and 7.25 fm for the @xmath51 , 8.4 and 7.7 fm for the @xmath52 and 8.5 fm for the @xmath50 based on the values obtained for pion interferometry  @xcite .",
    "our results for the @xmath51 are 4.93 and 4.85 fm , for the @xmath52 are 3.7 and 2.5 fm , and for the @xmath50 are 9.97 and 9.39 fm respectively at @xmath1 = 0.15 and 0.25 gev respectively ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "thus we feel that the results for the @xmath48 as well as the results for the single photons at low @xmath1 quoted by the wa98 experiment ( based on the value of the parameter @xmath105 in the eq.([fit ] above ) , are model dependent and uncertain to the extent that they use correlation radii determined from pion interferometry .",
    "we also see that at least the side - ward and the longitudinal radii for photon correlations are much smaller than the corresponding values for the pion interferometry .",
    "a full three dimensional determination of the correlation function will go a long way in getting reliable results and constraining the theoretical calculations discussed here .",
    "we now present results for correlation functions for thermal photons at rhic and lhc energies ( see figs.[fig7][fig10 ] ) .    looking at fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , for central collisions of gold nuclei at rhic energies , we note that the two - source aspect in the out - ward correlation function becomes more clear , due to increased contributions from the ( smaller but stronger ) quark - matter .",
    "of - course , it is known  @xcite that we shall have a large contribution of pre - equilibrium photons at larger @xmath1 and this trend should continue at lhc energies .",
    "this will further enhance the contribution of the smaller - sized source , and the structure seen here , will disappear .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of the source sizes ( fig .  [ fig8 ] ) , is similar in nature to what we see at sps energies , though the ` seat ' of the ` reclining chair ' seen in the out - ward size gets narrower , as one would expect for a more rapidly expanding source .",
    "the longitudinal correlation length is again seen to decrease rapidly with the increase in the transverse momentum .",
    "these trends continue at lhc energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) and the transverse momentum dependence of the source sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) becomes very pronounced .",
    "the so - called ` seat ' in the outward correlation vanishes completely , and all the radii decrease roughly as @xmath106 , with @xmath107 @xmath72 0.27 for the outward correlation , about 0.14 for the side - ward correlation and about 0.94 for the longitudinal correlation .",
    "we note that at none of the energies , the longitudinal correlation function resembles a gaussian , as normally assumed in parametrization .",
    "this is perhaps related to the emission of the photons from all the points in a longitudinally expanding system .",
    "in fact , similar shape is seen for the longitudinal correlation function for pions ` escaping ' from the system  @xcite and for pions produced from partonic cascades  @xcite .",
    "the difference of the out - ward and side - ward correlation radii is often associated with the life - time of the source . in order to see the evolution of this parameter with the transverse momentum of the thermal photons we plot their difference as well as their ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , for the three systems studied in the present work .",
    "we see the ` reclining chair ' behaviour for the sps energies , and a more rapid decrease as we go from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "several interesting results emerge .",
    "firstly the difference @xmath108 is nearly unaltered as we go from sps to rhic for photons having transverse momenta less than 0.5 gev .",
    "we have already noted that the ` seat ' of variation is caused by the competition between cooling due to expansion and the blue - shift of the momenta due to the transverse flow .",
    "the more rapid decrease of the difference arises due to a more rapid cooling and an increased flow as the initial temperature rises .",
    "the same trend is seen for the ratios .",
    "an experimental confirmation or a refutation of theses predictions will be very valuable .",
    "before summarizing , it may be of use to discuss some aspects which we have overlooked in the present work .    it should be of interest to examine the role of the reactions of the type @xmath109 or @xmath110 , for the intensity interferometry of photons .",
    "firstly , the quark matter contribution to single photons is already marginal for low transverse momenta , which is the subject of our focus here .",
    "then we note such photon pairs ( `` diphotons '' ) will be produced at ` a point ' and not at different locations like a pair which comes from , say , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "more - over their transverse momentum difference @xmath113 , where @xmath1 is the transverse momentum of either photon . for calculations which we can treat perturbatively ,",
    "this difference is at least an order of magnitude larger than the values of @xmath114 where the correlation function has a significant value . of - course one could include them as a source of single photons .",
    "however they are suppressed by a factor @xmath115 compared to the @xmath116 , say .",
    "let us also discuss the role of direct ( qcd ) photons to the @xmath1 region under consideration here and for which we have experimental data at sps energies from the wa98 experiment .",
    "in addition to the results given here , calculations have been reported by dumitru et al .",
    "@xcite , where large values for intrinsic momenta of partons are used to exhaust the wa98 data beyond @xmath117 3 gev .",
    "the calculations exhaust only about 50% of the single photon yield at 2 gev ( as in the present work ) and less than 20% of the yield at 1 gev .",
    "turbide et al .",
    "@xcite have extrapolated the pqcd results down to zero transverse momenta ( ! ) and find that the thermal photon yield is up to 4 orders of magnitude larger than the direct photon yield at lower transverse momenta .",
    "parton cascade model calculations for sps energies @xcite show the dominance of quark matter contributions beyond 3 gev ( including photons which could be termed thermal , from the quark - matter ) but a much smaller production from them at lower @xmath1 .",
    "these considerations should convince us that indeed thermal photons dominate in the region of transverse momenta considered here .",
    "we may also recall here the results of two works , which address similar issues .",
    "peressounko  @xcite has used hydrodynamics calculations with rates for the production of photons from quark matter and hadronic matter , along with the photons from the decay of pions to get @xmath37 as well as the correlation radii , for direct photons .",
    "while the @xmath50 and the @xmath52 vs. @xmath1 behaviour estimated by him are similar to ours , his work shows a very unusual result : the @xmath51 actually increases , and that too substantially , with increase in @xmath1 .",
    "considering that photons having large transverse momenta are produced very early in the collision when the transverse expansion has not yet set - in , this is hard to understand .",
    "similarly , the decrease in the values of the correlation radii , as @xmath1 decreases below 0.5 gev at sps energies is also difficult to fathom .",
    "other differences could be attributed to the more complete rates for photon production used in the present work .",
    "the work of renk  @xcite is interesting in that it uses a fire - ball description to model the collision at sps and rhic energies .",
    "the parameters of the fireball are adjusted to reproduce the pion spectra as well as the hbt radii for pions .",
    "the differences seen in the present work then arise due to the explicit appearance of a mixed phase here , during which the speed of sound is zero and acceleration of the expansion is stalled .",
    "results of an investigation using different equations of state , including one which does not admit a mixed phase , will be published shortly .    in brief , the side - ward , out - ward , and longitudinal correlation functions for intensity interferometry of thermal photons at sps , rhic , and lhc energies are calculated .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of these radii are very different from the corresponding results for pions , which are expected to decrease as @xmath118 for all the components .",
    "the longitudinal correlations for the three energies are quite similar and may be indicative of boost - invariance of the flow assumed in the work .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 at lhc decreases rapidly and approaches unity , due to increase in @xmath51 due to expansion and decrease in @xmath50 due to rapid cooling .",
    "as the results are free from distortions due to final state interactions and uncertainties about the production - vertexes , or the production mechanism of the particles under investigation , a confirmation or refutation of the findings will be very valuable .",
