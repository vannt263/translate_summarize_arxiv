    "as is well - known , the set of knots in the 3-sphere is classified into four classes ; the _ trivial knot _ , _ torus knots _ , _ satellite knots _ and _ hyperbolic knots _ , depending on the types of the essential surfaces of non - negative euler characteristic lying in their exteriors .",
    "the trivial knot is the only knot that contains an essential disk in its exterior , while the torus knot exteriors contain essential annuli but do not contain essential tori .",
    "the class of satellite knots consists of knots admitting essential tori .",
    "classical studies on knots prove that the essential annuli in the exterior of torus knots or satellite knots are very limited , that is , each of them is either a cabling annulus or that which can be extended to decomposing spheres ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : bz85 ] ) .",
    "the class of hyperbolic knots consists of knots whose exteriors are _ simple _ , that is , do not admit any essential surfaces of euler characteristic at least zero .",
    "by thurston s hyperbolization theorem @xcite , the complement of each hyperbolic knot admits a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume .",
    "a great many studies on knots have been based on this classification .",
    "a genus @xmath0 handlebody @xmath1 embedded in the 3-sphere @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is a non - negative integer , is called a _",
    "genus @xmath0 handlebody - knot _ and denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath0 equals one , the study of handlebody - knots coincides with the classical knot theory . on the other hand",
    ", the study of handlebody - knots whose exteriors are also handlebodies is related to the theory of heegaard splittings . by thurston s hyperbolization theorem again , the exterior @xmath4 of handlebody - knot @xmath1 of genus at least two is simple if and only if @xmath4 admits a hyperbolic structure with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "otherwise , the configurations of essential surfaces of non - negative euler characteristic in the exterior @xmath4 are much more complicated in general compare to the case of knots .",
    "the aim of this paper is to classify these essential surfaces in the exteriors of genus two handlebody - knots .",
    "in fact , we classify , without overlap , the essential disks into three types ( cf . section [ sec : classification of essential disks in the exteriors of genus two handlebodies embedded in the 3-sphere ] ) , the essential annuli into four types ( cf . section [ sec : classification of essential annuli in the exteriors of genus two handlebodies embedded in the 3-sphere ] ) , the essential mbius bands into two types ( cf . section [ sec : classification of essential mobius bands in the exteriors of genus two handlebodies embedded in the 3-sphere ] ) , and the essential tori into three types ( cf .",

    "this should be contrasted with the case of knots ; the essential annuli , for example , in knot exteriors can be classified into two types , as was mentioned above . to obtain the above classification",
    ", we fully use the results on essential planar surfaces and punctured tori properly embedded in the exteriors of knots , which are strongly related to the study of dehn surgeries on knots in the 3-sphere that produce reducible or toroidal 3-manifolds .    in @xcite",
    ", motto gave an infinite family of genus two handlebody - knots , and using essential annuli lying in their exteriors , he showed that the handlebody - knots in the family are mutually distinct whereas they have homeomorphic exteriors . in @xcite , lee and lee",
    "provided other infinite families of genus two handlebody - knots such that the handlebody - knots in each of the families are mutually distinct whereas they have homeomorphic exteriors .",
    "detailed description of essential annuli in the exteriors of the handlebody - knots again played an important role in their paper .",
    "also , in @xcite , eudave - muoz and the second - named author determined essential annuli that can be extended to 2-decomposing spheres in tunnel number one , genus two handlebody - knot exteriors and they characterized their summands by @xmath5-decomposing spheres . each of the above families of essential annuli is entirely contained in one type of the essential surfaces studied in this paper .    on the other hand , the first - named author defined in @xcite the _ symmetry group _ of a handlebody - knot .",
    "this is the group of isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms of @xmath2 leaving the handlebody - knot invariant .",
    "when the exterior of a genus two handlebody - knot is boundary - reducible or simple , a finite presentation of its symmetry group can be obtained following @xcite .",
    "however , apart from a few examples , the symmetry groups of the remaining handlebody - knots still remain unknown .",
    "the result in this paper would be a beginning step to developing the study of the symmetry groups .    in @xcite ,",
    "ishii , kishimoto and the second - named author showed the unique decomposition theorem with respect to a special kind of @xmath5-decomposing spheres for handlebody - knots of arbitrary genus whose exteriors are boundary - irreducible . in an appendix of the paper , we prove the same uniqueness theorem for arbitrary handlebody - knots .    throughout this paper , we will work in the piecewise linear category .",
