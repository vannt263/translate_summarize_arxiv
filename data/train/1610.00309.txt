    "in a neurofeedback investigation , @xcite refer to `` criticality analyses '' alluding to self - organised criticality  a theory inconclusively supported by the neuroscientific data .",
    "this term self - organised criticality , or just `` criticality '' , is often misconstrued as a property of a physical system , whereas self - organised criticality is , rather , a theory of the interactions within multiple simple elements in a physical system .",
    "this theory assumes systems of such elements tend to criticality : inter - elemental interactions , termed critical branching , poise that system in a `` critical state '' between responding in two ways . in a critical state ,",
    "a system can respond either through linear local interactions or through a higher - amplitude nonlinear propagation of the response via a widespread network of elements . that nature of interaction between elements leading to such a system , poised in what is called a critical state , is termed `` critical branching '' .    this theory originated in the peer - reviewed articles on systems such as accumulating piles of long - grain rice self - organising into a critical state . in turn",
    "the theory become widely popularised across several domains , including systems neuroscience and now clinical neurophysiology .",
    "characteristics of a system in a critical state derived by criticality analyses include @xmath0 spectra , avalanche dynamics , and fractal self - similarity in the scale - invariance of power - law scaling of long - range temporal correlations ( lrtcs ) .",
    "poignant is zhigalov _",
    "et al._ s departure from linking a criticality interpretation of neuronal lrtcs to arguably conscious phenomena such as fluctuations of sustained attention : previously , analysing meg - derived time - series , @xcite not only identified such neuronal lrtcs , but also an avalanche dynamics  another characteristic of criticality . investigating power - scaling of lrtcs , during a stimulus detection task , neuronal exponents correlated positively not only with behavioural exponents but also with neuronal exponents at rest",
    ". these behavioural lrtcs concern periods of attention when the participant correctly identifies a stimulus at threshold punctuated by periods of inattention when the participant is incorrect .",
    "thus power - scaling of those lrtcs shows that the extent of fluctuation on one timescale determines that on others  psychologically , there is a power - scaling of fluctuations of sustained attention .",
    "measures of the amplitude and duration of highly nonlinear neuronal avalanches during the task correlate negatively with both behavioural and neuronal lrtc exponents .",
    "nevertheless , those avalanche measures did not significantly predict behaviour independently from neuronal exponents @xcite .",
    "these findings call into question the role of avalanches as a cause for transitions between attention and inattention  there is no such avalanche ( private communication , alexander y. zhigalov , 2015 ) .",
    "thus self - organised criticality , encompassing an avalanche dynamics , can not drive fluctuations of sustained attention .",
    "concerns include the objectively incorrect mathematical expression of the parcellation strategy computation ( private communication , muriel lobier , 2015 ) .",
    "that is , there was a confusion in the in - house data pipeline of palva and colleagues between the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers used in calculating similarities of phase between time series in measures such as the phase - locking value ( plv ) and the distinct imaginary plv @xcite .",
    "this confusion has consequences for fidelity and infidelity measures @xcite used in the parcellation strategy of the foundational work @xcite ; private communication , muriel lobier , 2015 ) that @xcite cite as motivating their study .",
    "while this objective error might be trivialised ( private communication , jaakko m. palva , 2015 ) , if further weight is to be placed on the results of @xcite for the motivation and interpretation of new investigations , errata are warranted demonstrating this concern does not considerably alter those results . a further concern that could also necessitate an erratum to the foundational work for @xcite s study",
    "is the elevated false discovery rate of the in - house data pipeline ( private communication , hugo eyherabide , 2015 ) used in the cited foundational work of @xcite .     to @xmath1 ( * b * ) eliciting complexes of overlapping flash - evoked deterministic erp alpha - band waveforms and exponential oscillatory amplitude gain in the o2 recording of alpha - band , @xmath2 , during the first neurofeedback block @xmath3 .",
    "effective neurofeedback succeeds high - amplitude oscillations not exceeding a physiological maximum , @xmath4 .",
    "composite erp - oscillatory waveforms trigger flash volleys until the influence of physiological sources , including this exponential gain , rise over a physiological maximum or , fall below a calibrated minimum , @xmath5 , ceasing the contribution of oscillatory gain .",

    "if a subset of the hallmarks of self - organised criticality need be present for critical branching to be operational , then surely the conceptual integrity of the notion is subject to question : a critical branching with an avalanche dynamics @xcite would be theoretically distinct from that seemingly without @xcite .",

    "however , it is hard to imagine how the paradigm of @xcite engendered participants to be unconscious of flashes that they could see .",
    "no neurofeedback - related changes in the visibility of the flashes through the participant s eyelids are reported .",
    "the point is that physical characteristics of a stimulus need to be in principle accessible to perceptual consciousness to elicit erps .",
    "luminance increments arguably summon attention when a luminance increment defines the to - be - attended stimulation @xcite .",
    "accordingly , consciously perceived luminance increments involuntarily attentional capture .      , contain ongoing oscillations @xmath13 , simplified to @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 is constant within an epoch , added to the deterministic erp , @xmath16 , as detailed in supplementary materials , with only one flash - evoked deterministic erp evoked per epoch .",

    "in line with zhigalov _ et al._ s fig .",
    "4 , ongoing alpha oscillations are thus less strongly represented in the pre - stimulus baseline of averages of 800 epochs , @xmath21 , time - locked to ( * c * ) control sham epochs @xmath22 then for ( * d * ) treatment neurofeedback epochs @xmath23 . , width=529 ]    delivering the neurofeedback flash at a fixed interval from the alpha peak causes ongoing alpha to represent more strongly in the pre - stimulus baseline .",
    "that is , the neurofeedback treatment epochs were phase - locked to a particular point in the alpha cycle . on the sham control trials , there was no such phase - locking , alpha cycles appearing in epochs starting at multiple phases with flash onset .",
    "as such , in averaging alpha cycles were of very similar phase in all neurofeedback treatment epochs averaged , of differing phase in all sham control epochs averaged .",
    "after averaging the alpha waveform phase - locked to the onset is thus apparent in a feedback not sham averages of zhigalov _ et al._ s figure 4 . as schematised in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , this ongoing alpha thus considerably averages - out on sham trials .",

    "a corollary is that erps are an amplitude modulation of non - zero mean oscillations in the ongoing eeg @xcite .",

    "whilst critical branching might be considered a mechanism , the observed effects do not warrant the conclusion that these effects influence such a mechanism .",
    "these effects can not reveal the biological mechanisms of the effects and as such , although feasible , the principles of the micromodel offered in supplementary material are not specified at a mechanistic level of detail .",
    "rather , as the implementation demonstration - proof that critical branching is not a necessary mechanism , the micromodel reveals effects on the , seemingly critical , power - scaling of lrtcs : this micromodel uses random gaussian noise generated with a computer algorithm instead of a critical branching process ( for a related perspective , please see * ? ? ?",

    "there is further support for this notion that deterministic erp complexes and spindles of increasing oscillatory alpha gain introduce the temporal structure reflected by the lrtc : these mean power - scaling exponents of the phase - randomised surrogate data reside more within the lower range of the simulated resting - state @xmath38 mean exponent , @xmath71 , 0.503 , 95% ci [ 0.483 , 0.560 ] , without stimulation . for neither neurofeedback block",

    "rather , this simulated influence of neurofeedback on lrtcs relies on a long - term dynamics emergent from flash - elicited complexes of deterministic erps and accumulating exponential oscillatory alpha gain spindles due to closed - loop flash neurofeedback stimulation during consecutive alpha oscillation peaks . the micro - behaviours ( fig .",

    "[ fig : one]*e * , this change increases the power - scaling exponent of lrtcs exponents from @xmath67 to @xmath68 : in zhigalov et al.s data , the mean @xmath67 ( 0.695 ) on the neurofeedback block 1 is near - identical to the mean exponent from the corresponding first sham block .",
    "by contrast , mean @xmath68 is higher on neurofeedback block 3 ( 0.671 ) than on the third sham block @xmath74 . as an aside , it is worth considering that significant changes in mean @xmath75 , denoting power - scaling of lrtcs , are visible in the actual data ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ fig : one]*b * ) from the first ( 0.695 ) to third sham blocks ( 0.647 ) .",
    "this block - to - block change in temporal structure is neither attributable to neurofeedback nor to changes in the influence of deterministic erps nor to oscillatory alpha gain .",
    "the model s assumptions , centred on neurofeedback , are agnostic to these relatively longstanding confounding changes , apparent in the sham , which led to an attenuation in the power - scaling exponents lrtcs from the first to the third neurofeedback block in the actual data .",
    "candidate explanations of these longstanding changes might include the consequences of continued mere exposure to flashes on temporal structure rather than neurofeedback effects per se .    given",
    "the actual @xmath67 was near - identical on the first set of neurofeedback and the first set sham blocks , the empirically motivated simulation control , circumventing the confounding influence of these longstanding changes , should concern an unconfounded effect of neurofeedback block ( @xmath68 @xmath9 @xmath67 ) .",
    "this effect should , for definiteness , be as strong as the difference between the actual sham lrtc exponent on block 3 ( mean : 0.647 ) and the actual neurofeedback lrtc exponent on block 3 ( mean : 0.671 ) , i.e. , 0.024 .",
    "the model surpasses this criterion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one]*e * ) , with an increase in mean lrtcs exponents for neurofeedback blocks 1 and 3 of 0.033 .",
    "that is , the simulation model thus takes a tenable stance on how neurofeedback on the later third block boosts the power - scaling exponents of lrtcs in a way that the neurofeedback on the first block does not .    on balance , neurofeedback has more influence on the later block 3 , as apparent in the averaged waveforms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one]*d * ) , because of a faster rise in exponential oscillatory alpha gain , as well as an additive increase in the amplitude of deterministic erp componentry visible in figs .",
    "[ fig : one]*c**d*. on the later block , the simulation s results reveal spindles of oscillatory gain superposed upon higher - amplitude deterministic erps , yielding volleys of reciprocal neurofeedback stimulation with a higher proportion of ineffective flashes in those volleys due to @xmath38 more regularly exceeding the physiological maximum , @xmath50 . when that maximum is thus exceeded , the ineffectiveness of those flashes to yield an increase in alpha only occasionally brings a neurofeedback stimulation reciprocal volley to an immediate closure .",
    "this ineffective flash still elicits a deterministic erp , which is higher in amplitude than on the first block . that deterministic erp , insensitive to whether the flash was effective or ineffective in producing an increase in oscillatory gain , reduces the chances of the next few peaks of @xmath76 , at the peaks of @xmath13 , falling below the calibrated minimum @xmath39 for triggering a flash .    just as when comparing neurofeedback blocks to surrogate data , considering neurofeedback blocks 1 and 3 , the block - to - block change in power - scaling of lrtcs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one]*e * ) need not require critical branching . rather , the blockwise changes in long - term dynamics are emergent from several factors operating during the third block of closed - loop flash neurofeedback stimulation .",
