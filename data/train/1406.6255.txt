    "graphene is a newly discovered electronic material which attracts a lot of attention , for both potential applications and unique physical properties  @xcite . for electronics ,",
    "the improvement of the graphene quality requires the identification of the main sources of scattering which limit the mobility and this is usually done by transport experiments  @xcite . at intermediate magnetic fields , between the realms of weak localization and quantum hall effect , recent measurements highlighted the role of the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) on the magnetoconductivity.@xcite",
    "a complete theory of eei in graphene is still missing , but it is possible to use the knowledge accumulated in more conventional two - dimensional systems like thin metal films or semiconductor heterostructures , for which eei has been theoretically and experimentally studied over more than three decades  @xcite . the quantum correction due to the eei differs at low and high temperatures . when the effective interaction time , @xmath3 , is larger than the transport time @xmath4 , the electrons experience many collisions during their interaction : they are in a diffusive regime and the correction of the zero - field conductivity follows a logarithmic dependence on the temperature . when @xmath5 , electrons collide at most with one impurity .",
    "this ballistic regime leads to linear - in-@xmath0 corrections to the zero - field conductivity .",
    "a first complete theory , unifying both regimes , was developed  @xcite but is only valid if impurities can be considered as point - like scatterers .",
    "this condition is satisfied in si metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistor ( mosfet )  @xcite and in some semiconductor heterostructures , where carrier scattering is dominated by background impurities  @xcite . in graphene ,",
    "the validity of this theory is questionable as the dominant scattering depends on both the graphene quality and the characteristics of the environment .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we will rely on a more recent theory  @xcite which predicts the eei correction at all temperatures for both short and long ranges disorder .",
    "besides , eei in graphene is specifically sensitive to the type of disorder , both in the diffusive  @xcite and ballistic regimes with unusual temperature dependencies .",
    "in particular , in the ballistic regime , eei depends on the impurity type  @xcite and can give indications on the microscopic nature of disorder in graphene .",
    "up to now , most of the eei measurements in graphene have focused on the diffusive regime  @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of eei correction in this material , from the diffusive to the ballistic regime , associated with quantitative and qualitative comparisons with models of disorder , is still lacking .",
    "this is the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> we present the magnetoresistance ( mr ) of highly doped monolayer graphene layers grown by chemical vapor deposition on 6h - sic . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetotransport studies are performed on a large temperature range , from @xmath0 = 1.7 k up to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the mr exhibits a maximum in the temperature range @xmath1 k. the maximum is observed at intermediate magnetic fields ( @xmath2 t ) , in between the weak localization and the shubnikov - de haas regimes . </S>",
    "<S> it results from the competition of two mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> first , the low field magnetoresistance increases continuously with @xmath0 and has a purely classical origin . </S>",
    "<S> this positive mr is induced by thermal averaging and finds its physical origin in the energy dependence of the mobility around the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> second , the high field negative mr originates from the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the diffusive to the ballistic regime is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the eei correction points towards the coexistence of both long and short range disorder in these samples . </S>"
