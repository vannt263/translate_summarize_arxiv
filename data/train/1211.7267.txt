    "qcd is already 40 years old but we do not know yet the answer to a key question about mass generation of hadrons . in the light quark sector , with the quark masses of a few mev ,",
    "practically the whole hadron mass consists of the energy of the quantized gluonic field .",
    "this straightforward answer from the trace anomaly of qcd is correct but not satisfactory .",
    "we are interested in the mechanism of the mass generation .",
    "are confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking interconnected and how do they contribute to the hadron mass ?",
    "it is also important to shed the light on this issue if we want to understand the phase diagram of qcd .",
    "it was believed that the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum is the crucial phenomenon responsible for the hadron mass generation : the hadron mass in the light quark sector is determined mainly by the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "this is certainly true for the pion , which as the ( pseudo ) goldstone boson originates from the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "is it true , however , that the nucleon , the rho - meson and other hadron masses also come mostly from the quark condensate of the vacuum ? given this view , it was expected that upon chiral restoration masses of these and other hadrons should drop off @xcite and eventually beyond the chiral restoration phase transition ( crossover ) the hadrons should dissappear . in other words , without the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum there can not be any confined hadrons .",
    "the t hooft anomaly matching conditions @xcite formally state , that at zero temperature and density in the confining mode the chiral symmetry should be indeed spontaneously broken , though they do not suggest any insight why it should be so .",
    "this generic statement does not imply , however , that the hadron mass should be made mostly of the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "the latter view had essentially phenomenological @xcite and model grounds starting from the bag model in the past up to contemporary schwinger - dyson approaches to hadrons .",
    "the t hooft anomaly matching conditions do not constrain , however , the interrelation between the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking at nonzero temperatures and densities .",
    "another argument , according to casher @xcite , was that the quark can not be confined without the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum .",
    "if so , hadrons can not exist in the world with unbroken chiral symmetry .",
    "however , it was shown that the casher argument is not general and can be easily bypassed @xcite . in particular , at least within the manifestly confining model hadrons with rather large mass can still exist in a dense medium at low temperatures where the chiral symmetry is restored @xcite .",
    "another interesting issue is whether the highly excited hadrons reveal or not effective restoration of the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "if yes ( it should be confirmed or disproved experimentally ) , then their mass should not be influenced by the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "there are also some experimental hints , that hadrons in this regime reveal some higher symmetry , that includes @xmath1 as a subgroup .",
    "we want to shed some light on all these questions . for this purpose we can use lattice qcd as a tool to explore the interrelation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking and to check whether or not hadrons can still exist in a world without breaking of chiral symmetry in a vacuum .",
    "if yes , what happens with their mass and what symmetries do they have in this regime ?",
    "the idea , that the low - lying modes of the dirac operator , that are responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking are crucial for hadron masses such as nucleon or @xmath2-meson , etc . , has its roots in the instanton liquid model of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the effect of the low - lying modes of the dirac operator on different hadron correlators was studied on a small lattice within the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "we pose just the opposite question : will hadrons survive if we remove the low - lying modes keeping the gluodynamics intact ?",
    "such a procedure is a well - defined one @xcite and for the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons was implemented in @xcite .",
    "here we study both baryons and mesons as well their symmetries after such artificial chiral restoration @xcite .",
    "the quark condensate of the vacuum is related to a density of the lowest quasi - zero eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xcite :    @xmath6    here first the infinite volume limit is assumed at a finite quark mass and then the chiral limit should be taken .    from the lattice calculations in a given finite volume",
    "we can not say a priori which and how many lowest eigenmodes of the dirac operator are responsible for the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "we remove an increasing number of the lowest dirac modes from the valence quark propagators ,    @xmath7    and study the effects of the ( remaining ) chiral symmetry breaking on the masses of hadrons . here",
    "@xmath8 is the untrancated quark propagator , the @xmath9 are the ( real ) eigenvalues of the hermitian dirac operator @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the corresponding eigenvectors and @xmath12 represents the number of the removed lowest - lying modes .",
    "we perform our calculations on the unquenched two - flavor configurations with chirally improved fermions @xcite on the lattice size of 2.4 fm at the pion mass @xmath13 mev .",
    "an interesting observation is that for all hadrons under our study , except for a pion , the quality of the exponential decay of the correlators essentially improves by increasing the number of removed eigenmodes .",
    "the exponential decay of the correlator with the given quantum numbers indicates that there is a state with the same quantum numbers .",
    "assume that after removal of a sufficient amount of the low - lying modes the exponential decay signals from all hadrons would disappear .",
    "this would indicate that hadrons also disappear , i.e. there is not confinement without the chiral modes of the dirac operator .",
    "we observe , however , a very clean signal from all hadrons , except for a pion .",
    "the hadrons survive this artificial unbreaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "even more , the nucleon and rho - meson masses do not decrease upon chiral restoration , see figs . 1 and 2 !",
    "if hadrons survive the restoration of the @xmath1 chiral symmetry in the vacuum , they must fall into parity - chiral multiplets @xcite .",
    "these multiplets for the @xmath14 mesons are as follows :    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     if the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken the states from two distinct multiplets @xmath15 and @xmath16 that have the same isospin but opposite spatial parity are connected to each other by the @xmath0 transformation . in our real world",
    "@xmath0 is broken both via the axial anomaly and via the quark condensate of the vacuum . in the world with restored @xmath17 symmetry a @xmath2 meson , that is the chiral partner to the @xmath18 meson , must be degenerate with the @xmath19 state .    on fig .",
    "1 we show the mass evolution of the isovector mesons with @xmath14 upon the truncation of the low - lying modes .",
    "both the number of the removed modes @xmath12 as well as the maximal energy @xmath20 of these modes are shown .    at the truncutaion energy @xmath21 mev the @xmath22 splitting vanishes , a direct indication of the chiral @xmath23 restoration in the physical states .",
    "the large @xmath24 and @xmath25 splittings persist , however .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 breaking does not disappear .",
    "while that @xmath0 breaking component that is due to the chiral condensate should vanish with the condensate , the @xmath0 breaking via the axial anomaly still persists .",
    "indeed , the quark determinant that contains the @xmath0 breaking in the vacuum , is not affected by our truncation of the valence quarks .",
    "however , this result does show that there is not direct interconnection of the lowest lying modes of valence quarks and the mechanism of the @xmath0 splittings in qcd .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath26 mesons become degenerate , too . these @xmath2 and @xmath26",
    "are different states because they appear in different eigenvalues of the correlation matrix ( i.e. their eigenvectors are orthogonal ) and because they are well split before the removal of the low modes .",
    "this degeneracy indicates some higher symmetry that includes chiral @xmath1 as a subgroup .",
    "if baryons survive chiral restoration they have to fall into baryonic parity - chiral multiplets :      the first representation consists of nucleons of positive and negative parity of the same spin .",
    "another representation contains both positive and negative parity @xmath28 s with the same @xmath29 .",
    "finally , the third representation combines one nucleon and one delta parity doublet with the same spin .",
