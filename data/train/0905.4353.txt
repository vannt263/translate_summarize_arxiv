    "at present , in cosmology there is a problem in determining the parameters of inflation , which , in fact , has become the standard model for the early stage of universe evolution @xcite _ before _ the big bang .",
    "the big bang is considered now as a short stage of reheating of the universe due to a transformation of inflaton energy into the energy of matter , whereas the inflaton is usually ascribed to be a real scalar field . in this respect",
    "it would be useful to have a complete arsenal of effective methods in order to describe various characteristics at the inflationary stage .",
    "these instruments would allow us to carry out a more thorough analysis of theoretical models in comparison with quite precise modern experimental data . at present , the basic tool of such studies is the slow - roll approximation in the field equations of inflation ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "the slow - roll dynamics of evolution can be consistently treated in the framework of a @xmath1-expansion at a large amount of e - folding @xmath2 for the scale factor of expansion , which was presented in @xcite as a general analysis of relative scaling behavior of inflaton quantities versus @xmath1 .",
    "so , the inflaton potential @xmath3 gets the characteristic scale @xmath4 by @xmath5 at @xmath6 gev , while the inflaton field @xmath7 behaves like @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the planck mass as given by the newton gravitational constant @xmath10 . in this respect",
    ", one could expect , for instance , a characteristic value of quartic coupling in the inflaton self - action of the order of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , one gets the tool of strict consideration of the slow - rolling regime .",
    "we follow another way , which is the method of the quasiattractor .",
    "this approach was offered in @xcite for the case of a quadratic potential , in order to generalize and develop investigations considering the dependence of cosmological evolution on initial data that were performed in @xcite .",
    "further , we have applied the same approach to the potential of @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "this kind of potential refers to the models of `` chaotic inflation '' , when the evolution occurs from large fields at planck scales towards the global minimum at @xmath13 .",
    "however , it would be useful to somehow generalize these results to a potential of the form @xmath14 , permitting , first , the opportunity of a situation with the scenario of `` new inflation '' , when the field evolves from a position in the vicinity of a local maximum at zero value of the field to the global minimum at @xmath15 .",
    "second , as we will see , such a potential allows us to essentially expand the region of admissible values of the potential parameters consistent with the data .",
    "this fact significantly increases the viability of the model .",
    "the quasiattractor approach can be described by the following : after choosing the model potential we derive the equations of the system motion , which are generally not analytically soluble , so that we try to treat the problem by applying some consistent approximations in order to describe the system evolution . in the method of the quasiattractor",
    "we introduce new dimensionless variables with presumed properties of scaling .",
    "then , the differential equations of the first order can be considered as an autonomous system .",
    "the system could attain stable critical points on a phase plane .",
    "the trajectories converge to these points , being the attractors .",
    "our first task is to search for such critical points .",
    "the notion of `` quasiattractor '' refers to the stable critical point of an autonomous system with external parameters slowly drifting with the evolution .",
    "the position of the critical point is not fixed , since it is determined by the control parameters , which evolve and displace the critical point .",
    "but the evolution velocity of the control parameters is slow enough in order to consider the displacement of the point in the phase space as driftage .",
    "thus , the system motion is the following : the system very quickly `` falls '' to the quasiattractor in the phase space , i.e. to the stable critical point slowly drifting during the evolution .",
    "so , the information about the initial position of the system is lost , while values of control parameters determining the position of attractor are important .",
    "the further evolution of system is exclusively determined by the driftage of the quasiattractor .",
    "the system motion is appropriated by the evolution of control parameters , and the system seems to lose some degrees of freedom .    as we will derive below",
    ", the driftage of the attractor is equivalent to the slow - roll regime of inflation treated in the framework of @xmath1-expansion considered in @xcite .    in section [ ii ]",
    "we consider mathematical aspects of the quasiattractor , while in section [ iii ] we compare theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "our results are in agreement with the precise analysis of a complete data set previously performed in @xcite in the framework of monte carlo markov chains . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the results obtained .",
    "let us consider the action of the inflaton in the form @xmath16 with the potential @xmath17 the evolution of a homogeneous isotropic flat universe is described by a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric ( flrw ) in cartesian coordinates @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor with its usual physical interpretation .",
    "the evolution equations read off as @xmath20   \\dot h & = & -4\\pi g \\dot\\phi^2.\\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath21 .",
    "the hubble rate is defined by @xmath22 .",
    "the friedmann relation is derived from ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , so that @xmath23 all of the equations ( [ 4])([6 ] ) are consequences of general relativity .      for the sake of simplicity",
    "let us change variables : @xmath24{\\frac{\\lambda}{12}}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}{\\sqrt{h } } \\sqrt{|\\phi^2-v^2|},\\label{8 } \\\\ z&=&\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{3\\lambda}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa h } } , \\\\",
    "u&=&\\frac{\\kappa v}{\\sqrt{6}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25",
    ". then , eqs .",
    "( [ 4])([6 ] ) take the form , so that the scenario of chaotic inflation is realized .",
    "otherwise , in the case of new inflation with @xmath26 , one should take the root with the opposite sign under the substitution @xmath27 in the radicand .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to removing the absolute value of the radicand in expression ( [ 8 ] ) , so that @xmath28 can formally run to negative values in the model of new inflation . ]",
    "@xmath29 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "then the relation @xmath31 is valid .",
    "the physical sense of @xmath2 is that it counts the amount of e - folding during the expansion of the universe from @xmath32 till the current point , i.e. when the scale factor increases by @xmath33 times .    in terms of the new variables the friedmann relation reads off as @xmath34 the equations",
    "are simplified , since they are already differential equations of the first order , though they are nonhomogeneous , which are easier for analysis than the initial ones .",
    "indeed , the two equations of ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) can be considered as an autonomous system of differential equations of the first order with external parameter @xmath35 . then , there is a question of the stability of given system .",
    "the numerical analysis shows , that the system is stable under some definite conditions .",
    "the control parameter of autonomous system is the slowly varying quantity @xmath35 . obviously , the driftage proceeds smoothly at @xmath36 .",
    "the question is when will the critical point be stable ? then , all of trajectories will approach this point , and it becomes the parametrical attractor , i.e. the quasiattractor , while the system , gradually having come to it , will remain at the critical point and drift together with it , and the evolution of the actually stable point ( the quasiattractor ) will be determined by the control quantity @xmath35 .",
    "equations for the quasiattractor ( @xmath37 ) are the following : @xmath38 it is worth noticing that the system of equations is compatible with the friedmann condition .",
    "for the sake of simplification of system , we can make the following change of variable : @xmath39 then , the equations transform and look less cumbersome without radicals : @xmath40 the scaling properties of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are equivalent , since these quantities differ by a shift , which depends on the external parameter controlling the driftage .",
    "if the variable @xmath42 is eliminated from the system , the equations for the critical point in the physical case of @xmath43 , @xmath44 are reduced to the single equation in @xmath45 ( we recall that the quantity @xmath35 is the parameter ) @xmath46      let us analyze the stability of the critical point @xmath47 . introduce small deviations from the attractor @xmath48 , then @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain the following differential equations for the deviations in the linear approximation : @xmath50 \\displaystyle \\frac{3}{2}\\,x_cy_c & \\displaystyle\\frac{9x_c^2y_c^4 + 4u^2z^4}{6y_c^4 } \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\delta x \\\\ \\delta y \\end{array } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the friedmann condition requires @xmath51 or @xmath52 i.e. the solution , satisfying the friedmann equation , will be proportional to the eigenvector @xmath53 such an eigenvector for the given matrix exists , and is single with the eigenvalue @xmath54 therefore , the evolution goes according to the law @xmath55 thus , we see , that this is the only solution of system .",
    "it satisfies the imposed constraints .",
    "further advancement of the analysis of the autonomous system will consist in the direct examination of the stability of the obtained solution .",
    "we require @xmath56 for stability of attractor .",
    "this condition is valid at small values of @xmath45 and @xmath35 ( then , according to the friedmann equation @xmath57 is close to 1 ) and @xmath58 is certainly less than zero .",
    "the constraint on the smallness of @xmath45 and @xmath35 is actually valid , as we will see below .",
    "let us consider universe inflation due to the inflaton with the chosen potential .",
    "the condition of accelerated expansion is the following : @xmath59 accordingly , such an expansion regime ends up with @xmath60    during the actual process of expansion with acceleration , the quantities should satisfy the inequalities , @xmath61 one can see that such values are in agreement with the condition making the attractor stable ( @xmath56 ) , since ( [ 34 ] ) gives @xmath62 hence , the accelerated expansion is governed by the stable quasiattractor .",
    "first of all , we determine how many times the universe expands from the initial state marked by `` in '' to the end of inflation marked by `` end '' .",
    "the total amount of e - folding @xmath2 is given by following expression , which follows from the equation for the parameter @xmath35 in ( [ n_z ] ) , @xmath63 here , the parameter @xmath45 is set at the point of the quasiattractor .    in order to find numerical values of the theory parameters , one should compare it with observational data .",
    "experiment measures the inhomogeneity of the cosmic microwave background , related to the inhomogeneity of matter , also independently measured , hence we need to find the distribution of the inflaton inhomogeneity , which leads to the matter inhomogeneity at the stage of reheating .",
    "such inhomogeneity is given by the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton .",
    "then , the spectral density of scalar and tensor perturbations look as @xmath64 and @xmath65 where the wave vector @xmath66 is determined by the hubble rate at the exit of fluctuations from the horizon , i.e. at @xmath67 .",
    "consider the ratio @xmath68 determining the relative contribution of tensor spectrum , @xmath69 and define the spectral index @xmath70 as @xmath71 one can easily see that @xmath72 so that differentiation with respect to the wave vector is reduced to derivative with respect to the parameter @xmath35 , determining the dynamics in the method of the quasiattractor .      from equation ( [ x ] ) at @xmath73 one approximately gets ) is valid for chaotic inflation , while in the scenario of new inflation one should change the sign of @xmath28 , i.e. one puts @xmath74 @xmath75 the friedmann condition in the forms of ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ fr2 ] ) strictly holds and yields @xmath76 in the limit under consideration , while the attractor position of ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) reduced to ( [ x_z ] ) gives the slow - roll equation @xmath77 .    then , substituting the above expression into ( [ n_total ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 & = & \\frac{3}{4 } \\left(u^2 \\ln{\\frac{\\sqrt{3u^2 + 1}-1+\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3u^2 + 1}-1}}-\\frac{u^2\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3u^2 + 1}-1}+ \\frac{1}{z^2_\\mathrm{in}}-u^2\\ln{\\frac{1+u^2z_\\mathrm{in}^2}{u^2z_\\mathrm{in}^2 } } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to simplify this bulky expression we can separate out the function obtained by substituting @xmath79 , giving the term , @xmath80 this function monotonically decreases in the interval @xmath81 , hence , it is restricted by limits at the borders @xmath82 since the inhomogeneity of the matter spectrum available for measurements actually refers to @xmath2 of the order of 60 , one can neglect the contribution of the upper limit in the integral , i.e. the value of function @xmath83 , to the leading approximation in @xmath1 .",
    "then , the expression for @xmath84 is simplified to @xmath85    now we can express @xmath84 in terms of the experimentally measured @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "we find @xmath86 and express all of other parameters as follows : @xmath87 and @xmath88 making use of the connection between @xmath89 and @xmath90 according to ( [ x_z ] ) , we get @xmath91    for the sake of simplicity , introduce the quantity @xmath92 @xmath93 satisfying the condition of @xmath94 equivalent to @xmath95 , because @xmath96 then , we can easily write down the final expression for @xmath84 @xmath97    the above expression can be `` parametrically solved '' .",
    "so , we introduce quantity @xmath98 according to @xmath99 then @xmath100 and @xmath101    the formula ( [ r ] ) exactly repeats the expression derived in @xcite in another notation in the framework of slow - roll approximation , while ( [ ns ] ) can match the result of @xcite , if one neglects subleading terms in the denominator of ( [ ns ] ) at @xmath102 .    in the limits of @xmath103 and @xmath104 we obtain the reference cases with potentials of form @xmath12 and @xmath105 , correspondingly . indeed , up to corrections of the order of @xmath1 as has been suggested in deriving ( [ r ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) , we find @xmath106 hence , the vanishing of the inflaton vacuum expectation value , i.e. nullifying the quadratic term in the potential , while @xmath107 that has reduced to zero the quartic term in the potential .",

    "\\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ] in complete consistency with the consideration of these cases in other approaches .",
    "generally , the scaling properties of inflation parameters versus @xmath1 are quite complicated because of additional dependence on variable @xmath109 , which can correlate with the amount of e - folding @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , one can see that at fixed @xmath109 , the limit of @xmath110 gives @xmath111 though , actually , the dependence on @xmath109 could crucially change the asymptotic behavior : for instance , at @xmath112 $ ] one gets @xmath113 $ ] , and @xmath114 .",
    "the real situation is clarified after the appropriate analysis of the experimental data set .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , a complete analysis of inflation models versus the experimental situation can be found in @xcite , having presented the evaluation of parameters in the framework of monte carlo markov chains under the slow - roll approximation of theoretical entries .    in the present paper , we will use the function in ( [ n_end ] ) for constructing the implicit dependence of @xmath70 versus @xmath68 at fixed @xmath2 .",

    "we can obtain quite wide limits of possible values for parameters of the model potential , namely @xmath134 at the 1-@xmath121 level , and @xmath135 at the 2-@xmath121 level in the 3 year data sample by wmap .",
    "the formally infinite vacuum expectation value for the inflaton certainly corresponds to the final value of its mass , as we shall see below .",
    "the data acquisition of 5 year sample leads to more strict constraints .",
    "so , the above estimates on @xmath2 with the confidence level of 1-@xmath121 transfer to the 2-@xmath121 level , as is clearly seen from the figure .    however , the amount of e - folding is , in fact , limited by the actual history of the universe evolution after inflation @xcite , so that the analysis leads to the typical value of @xmath136 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one has to take into account data of other experiments : that on baryonic acoustic oscillations and spacial distribution of galaxies ( bao ) @xcite as well as on the supernovae ia ( sn ) @xcite . such an analysis has been done in @xcite , and is presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig ] .",

    "indeed , the condition for the critical point ( [ 16 ] ) during inflation at @xmath140 can be approximately written down in the form @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",

    "the scale of quartic coupling is quite natural , if one takes into account the analysis of @xmath1-expansion during the inflation as performed in @xcite and mentioned in introduction .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath155 , the border of the applicability region for the potential is given by the following equation @xmath156 which is represented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .    experimental constraints for dependence of the spectral index on the number of e - folding @xmath2 in terms of the parameter @xmath157 are not restrictive , since they give a value compatible with zero at the confidence level of 2-@xmath121 , with the quite large uncertainty being greater than the expected value of this parameter in the model under study .",
    "therefore , we do not incorporate it into our estimates .",
    "thus , we see , that one could extract the mass of the inflaton corresponding to maximal definiteness for all of the potential parameters .",
    "thus , in the present paper we have carried out the analysis of an inflation model with the inflaton potential including both quadratic and quartic terms of self - action . the model has allowed us to consider scenarios of chaotic and new inflation in the framework of the quasiattractor method , which has enabled us to quite elegantly calculate the recently observed inhomogeneity of the cosmic microwave background and distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "we have shown that such a model is consistent with the observational data .",
    "one can see , of course , that this model of the potential _ parametrically _ can not satisfy all of the experimentally admissible values of @xmath70 and @xmath68 within the empirical uncertainties ( such a potential would not explain the presence of experimental points above the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) , but these restrictions are not critical within the accuracy of measurements , and the given potential seems to be consistent with the current data .",
    "we have obtained also , that observational data on the inhomogeneity of the universe corresponds to the time of forming the inflaton fluctuations , when the universe expands approximately @xmath158 times to the end of inflation , which is in agreement with other estimations .",

    "<S> inflation with a scalar - field potential of the form @xmath0 can be described in terms of a parametrical attractor with critical points , whose driftage depends on the control value of the slowly changing hubble rate . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows us to easily obtain theoretical expressions for fluctuations of inhomogeneity in both the cosmic microwave background and distribution of matter . </S>",
    "<S> we find the region for admissible values of potential parameters , wherein theoretical predictions are consistent with experimental results within the limits of measurement uncertainties . </S>"
