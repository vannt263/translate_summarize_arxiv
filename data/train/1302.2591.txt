    "bl lac objects are extragalactic sources for which the redshift @xmath1 can not be easily derived .",
    "this is due to the combination of intrinsically weak emission lines and strongly beamed nuclear non thermal emission .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 is obviously important in order to properly characterize their physical properties .",
    "while other distance indicators were introduced like the photometry of the host galaxy ( imaging redshift , see e.g. @xcite ) , or tev @xmath2-ray absorption by the ebl ( e.g. @xcite ) , the direct spectroscopic line observation remains the only way to produce a robust measure of their distance .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 is becoming even more compelling by the recent development of @xmath2-ray astronomy , which demonstrated that the extragalactic @xmath2-ray sky is dominated by this class of objects .",
    "+   + in order to improve the quality ( in terms of throughput , spectral resolution and s / n ratio ) of the spectrum , we have carried out systematic campaigns at european southern observatory very large telescope ( vlt ) , aimed to observe @xmath0 90 bl lac candidates of unknown redshift .",
    "results on the first three runs were presented in @xcite , paper i , ii and iii respectively , where the criteria of selection of the sample ( see also section [ subsec : sample ] ) , details on the used spectrometer , and the reduction and analysis procedure are given .",
    "+   + in this paper we report on observations of 33 new bl lac candidates that complete our observational campaign and for 25 of them we confirm their bl lac nature . in section",
    "[ sec : observations ] we summarize the observations and data reduction process and we show the results in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "the average spectrum of the class is presented in section [ sec : specmean ] , while a discussions of the properties for the full sample is reported in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "+   + throughout the paper we adopt the following concordant cosmology : @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the spectra were obtained in service mode using the focal reducer and a low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 , @xcite ) .",
    "the observations took place between april 2008 and june 2008 at vlt - ut1 ( antu ) and from september 2008 to february 2009 at vlt - ut2 ( kueyen ) .",
    "the spectrograph was configured with a 300v+i grism with a slit of 2@xmath7 achieving the spectral range of 3800 - 8300 @xmath8 with a dispersion of @xmath0 @xmath9 /pixel .",
    "detailed informations on the observations of each source are given in table [ tab : journal ] .",
    "the seeing during the observation was in the range 0.65@xmath7 - 2.50@xmath7 with an average of 1.20@xmath7 ( rms @xmath10 ) .",
    "+   + data reduction was executed using iraf adopting standard procedures .",
    "in particular , for each target we performed bias subtraction , flat fielding and bad pixels or cosmic rays rejection .",
    "for each object we secured 2 - 6 individual exposures that were then combined into a single average image .",
    "the wavelength calibration was achieved using the spectra of a helium neon argon lamp reaching an accuracy of @xmath0 3 @xmath8 rms .",
    "even though this program did not require photometric conditions during observations , checking the weather database at paranal , the sky was clear during most of the time .",
    "this enables us to flux calibrate our spectra using standard stars @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration was assessed through the relative photometric calibration of the acquisition image and the overall uncertainty is @xmath11 mag ( rms ) .",
    "finally , each spectrum has been dereddened applying the extinction law described in @xcite assuming the @xmath12 values computed by @xcite .",

    "we finally averaged the spectra according to their s / n ratio .",
    "the obtained mean spectrum is reported in figure [ fig : specmean ] and it covers the spectral range 1800 @xmath0 6700  , rest frame .",
    "the first panel shows the mean spectrum assuming for the continuum a power - law with index @xmath105 while the normalised spectrum is reported in the bottom panel .",
    "we measure the spectral features detectable on the average spectrum reporting the line identification , equivalent width and full width at half maximum in table [ tab : resavgmean ] .",
    "we note that due to the large difference in bl lacs of the ratio between the non - thermal emission and the thermal one associated to stellar component ( their host galaxy ) the mean bl lac spectrum can not be considered as representative as that of quasars . on the other hand , it illustrates emission or absorption lines that could be measured in individual objects .",
    "in particular , absorption lines from the host galaxy are always present in the spectrum but their detectability depends both on s / n ratio and on the nucleus - to - host ratio of the source ( see also [ sec : eelt ] ) .",
    "conversely , emission lines could be missing .",
    "according to the 11th veron - cetty catalog of agn objects ( veron 2003 ) at the time of the scheduling of our campaign in 2003 , 797 sources were known as candidate or confirmed bl lacs and 313 objects of the list were left without a reliable measure of their redshift . considering only the sources observable from the southern sky ( @xmath106 ) a total of 169 bl lacs objects remains of unknown redshift . from this set ,",
    "we selected objects with @xmath107 in order to secure an acceptable s / n ratio spectrum for each source . this additional constraint allowed us to select @xmath0 155 observable sources from the paranal with vlt+fors .",
    "we obtained time for the observation of 88 sources selected combining the 155 objects from the 11th veron catalog with further 44 sources from padovani and giommi 1995a .",
    "thanks to the high quality optical spectra , we confirmed as bona - fide bl lacs 69 sources while 15 have been classified as qso or fsrq .",
    "the remaining 4 objects are stars . for the sources that have been classified as bona - fide bl lac we were able to measured a spectroscopic redshift for 23 of them .",
    "in particular , in 12 sources we clearly detected the absorption features from their host galaxy and in 15 objects emission lines are observable .",
    "broad emission lines ( such as mg ii or c iii ] ) are detected in only 10 bl lacs .",
    "we measured the luminosity of mg ii emission lines in all the sources in which the line is detected .",
    "the mean value is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is in erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is lower of an order of magnitude of that of quasars which is @xmath110 ( @xcite ) but the dispersions are rather larger . for the remaining 46 sources we inferred a redshift lower limit ( see section [ sec : specdec ] ) .",
    "the full dataset , with spectra and line identification , is available at the website _",
    "http://www.oapd.inaf.it / zbllac/_.      in the radio emission , the relativistic beaming is manifest in bl lac objects because of the frequent appearance of jets with superluminal velocities .",
    "this is required in high energy emissions ( in @xmath2-rays ) by the short time scale of variability , which can be accommodated in a standard ssc model ( e.g. @xcite ) only invoking large doppler beaming factors . following the unified model of active galatic nuclei we assume that the optical emission arising from the nuclear component is basically the superposition of a thermal emission of luminosity @xmath111 associated with a disk structure and a non thermal one @xmath112 , which dominates the output power in bl lac objects . since the former component is isotropic and the latter",
    "supposedly is beamed , we can define as beaming factor ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath113 where @xmath114 = @xmath111 + @xmath112 .",
    "we further assume that the thermal components of bl lac objects can be described as that of quasars .",
    "the large collection of type i agn spectra available in the sdss allows to find relations between the broad line luminosity @xmath115 and the contiguous ( thermal ) luminosity for type i quasars .",
    "they are generally expressed in the form    @xmath116    for simplicity , we refer only to mg ii relation since it is the tightest one ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 , see @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the contribution of the cosmological redshift and combining equation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with the usual defintion of the equivalent width , one has @xmath119 @xmath66 is obviously equal to @xmath01 , within the dispersion , in the case type i quasar . when a broad mg ii line is observed in a bl lac object eq .",
    "( 4 ) gives an estimate of the beaming .",
    "if no emission line is detected one can still use eq .",
    "( 4 ) and from the upper limit on the equivalent width deduce a lower limit on @xmath66 .",
    "we suppose that the redshift is such that the relation can be applied because the mg ii emission line is within band of observation and we also consider the positive 1-@xmath120 dispersion on the relation , which yields @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , for featureless bl lacs we assume @xmath122 while for the bl lac in which the redshift is known we use the actual value for the redshift .",
    "the wide - spread criterion of defining a bl lac a type i agn with line @xmath123 , which was adopted also in this paper , therefore translates through eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xmath66 @xmath124 .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : overallbf ] we show the lower limit relation expressed in eq .",
    "( 4 ) for the beaming factor of bl lacs with no broad emission lines ( dashed line ) and the actual value of @xmath66 for the sources in which the broad mg ii emission line is detected ( filled blue circle ) .",
    "we note that @xmath0 7 bl lac candidates considered in our sample have spectral properties that do not completely satisfy the criterion for bl lac classification . on the other hand ,",
    "these objects differ also from the typical spectrum of type i agn .",
    "interesting enough they have their optical beaming factor ( open magenta circle of figure [ fig : overallbf ] ) much larger of that of quasar , where @xmath66 should be @xmath0 1 , suggesting a substantial non - thermal emission from the nucleus which indicates that the objects are indeed of intermediate nature between bl lac and quasars .      since bl lac objects",
    "are extragalactic sources it is reasonable to expect that their spectra could present absorption features from intervening systems . in particular",
    ", @xcite claimed that a strong excess of a factor @xmath0 4 on the number of mg ii intervening system is apparent in the spectra of bl lac objects , with respect to those of quasars .",
    "+ in our sample there are 7 confirmed bl lacs objects in which absorption systems are detected . these absorptions are interpreted as mg ii intervening systems on our line of sight toward the bl lac . in particular , the total number of absorbing systems is @xmath125 = 8 , partly associated with bl lacs with unknown redshift .",
    "the most natural interpretation is that the features are due to intervening mgii at @xmath126 .",
    "the features associated to intervening mg ii systems are observable in our sample in the redshift interval @xmath127 and @xmath128 .    the total number of bl lacs we consider is @xmath129 = 69 ( 23 with redshift measured and 46 lower limits on @xmath1 ) and those which have @xmath130 are 13 .",
    "therefore , excluding sources with @xmath130 the number of bl lacs which can contribute to the observed absorptions is at most 56 . on the other hand",
    "the minimum number which for sure contributes to the statistics of the absorbers is 8 , which are the observed systems associated to bl lacs in our sample , plus the number of bl lacs without intervening absorptions with @xmath131 that are 20 . following @xcite , who consider qsos in the sdss , for an arbitrary pointing direction the normalised mean number of mgii absorbers with ew @xmath132",
    "@xmath133 @xmath134 is @xmath135 in the redshift range given above . within these assumptions",
    "we expect that the number of mg ii absorption systems is @xmath136 @xmath137 .",
    "since in our sample we observe @xmath138 intervening systems we do not confirm the suggestion of @xcite and we conclude that absorbers related to bl lacs are not more numerous than those associated to qsos .",
    "moreover , if we assume that the distribution of mg ii intervening system for bl lac is not different from those of quasars , the number of observed absorption system could suggest that the bl lacs without @xmath1 in our sample should have low value for their redshift , in order to comply with the discussed statistical properties for intervening system .      in the spectrum of a bl lac object the absorption lines associated to the stellar components of the host galaxy are always present . on the other hand ,",
    "their detectability depends both on the s / n ratio and on the nucleus to host ratio ( n / h ) of the source ( see e. g. @xcite ) . with the state of the art 8-mt class telescopes and modern instrumentation it is possible to obtain spectra with s / n about 100 and r @xmath0 2000 for object of v @xmath0 17 ( assuming exposure time of @xmath0 1 hour ) . for sources with @xmath139",
    "the situation is even worse since the s / n typically drops below 50 .",
    "this limits the capability to detect the host galaxy features either for the sources with high intrinsic n / h ratio and for faint objects .",
    "for this reason , in order to significantly improve these limits , a future 40-mt class telescope like the european extreme large telescope ( e - elt ) is mandatory to investigate these kind of objects .",
    "+   +    as example of this capability we report here a simulation of the expected spectrum of a bl lac object observed by e - elt .",
    "assuming that the bl lac spectrum is the sum of a non thermal emission , modelled with a power law , and a stellar component described by a giant elliptical galaxy @xcite we performed the simulation of two cases .",
    "we consider an exposure time of 3600 s and a spectrograph with a dispersion of @xmath0 1.0 @xmath134 / pixel , with an efficiency similar to the vlt - fors2 .",
    "we take into account a standard galaxy characterised by @xmath140 and @xmath141 kpc .",
    "we adopted an aperture correction for a slit of 1@xmath7 x 1@xmath7 , similarly to the aperture effect correction fully described in paper ii .",
    "results are presented in figure [ fig : f_eelt ] . in the first case ( top panel ) ,",
    "the e - elt can obtain a spectrum with s / n @xmath0 2000 for an object with v = 17 and z = 0.40 .",
    "the features associated to the host galaxy are clearly detectable with an intrinsic n / h up to 100 in the band 5200 - 6200 @xmath134 .",
    "the second simulation ( bottom panel ) is carried out assuming v = 20 and z = 0.70 . in this case , the s / n ratio of the spectrum is @xmath0 500 and the intrinsic n / h ratio limit reached is @xmath0 40 .",
    "we note that the use of the e - elt allows to increase the s / n ratio of the spectra of a factor @xmath0 20 for the first case and @xmath0 10 for the latter respect to typical s / n ratios reached with the vlt . in the light of these results , we are confident that the advent of 40-mt telescope instrumentation can significantly decrease the fraction of bl lacs that are still left without @xmath1 .",
