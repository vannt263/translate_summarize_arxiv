    "the hot intergalactic gas ( @xmath6-@xmath7k ) is , with the galaxies themselves and the gravitational effects on background objects , one of the tools used to derive mass distributions within clusters of galaxies .",
    "it can be detected at x - ray wavelengths via its bremsstrahlung emission . from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) blackbody spectrum is distorted in the direction of the cluster by the so - called sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz , @xcite ) .",
    "this characteristic distortion is due to the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons by the intracluster electrons ( see @xcite for a detailed review on the sz effect ) .    in this letter , we report the sz measurement of the x - ray cluster rxj1347 - 1145 with the ground based diabolo millimeter instrument .",
    "this cluster has been observed with the rosat - pspc and hri instruments by schindler ( @xcite , @xcite ) . at a redshift of @xmath0",
    ", it appears as the most luminous x - ray cluster ( @xmath8 ) and so far one of the most massive ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is also a relatively hot and very dense cluster ( temperature : @xmath10 kev , central density : @xmath11  @xmath12 ) .",
    "optical studies of the gravitational lensing effects toward rxj1347 - 1145 have also been performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results have pointed out a discrepancy between the total mass obtained from the optical and the x - ray data , with a surface lensing mass toward the core ( @xmath13kpc ) being one to three times higher than the x - ray mass estimates . because the sz effect also directly probes the projected gas mass , which is not the case for x - ray masses , the comparison with sz measurements might help to discriminate .    in section  [ obs ]",
    ", we describe the diabolo instrument and our observations of rxj1347 - 1145 .",
    "the data reduction is explained in section  [ red ] . in a fourth part",
    "we present the values of the physical parameters we derived from the data fit .",
    "diabolo is a millimeter photometer which provides an angular resolution of about 23  when installed at the focus of the iram 30 meter radio telescope at pico veleta ( spain ) .",
    "it uses two wavelengths channels centered at about 1.2 and 2.1  mm .",
    "the detectors are bolometers cooled at 0.1 k with an open cycle @xmath14he-@xmath15he dilution refrigerator ( benoit @xcite ) .",
    "two thermometers associated to a heater and a pid digital control system are used to regulate the temperature of the 0.1 k plate .",
    "there are three adjacent bolometers per channel , arranged in an equilateral triangle at the focus of the telescope . for a given channel ,",
    "each bolometer is coaligned with one bolometer of the second channel , both looking toward the same sky direction .",
    "detections of the sz effect have already been achieved with diabolo on nearby clusters ( a2163 , 0016 + 16 , a665 ) with a single large throughput bolometer per channel at 30  resolution .",
    "the experimental setup is described in dsert ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only difference of the present configuration with the one described in the paper is the increase of the number of bolometers per wavelength channel and a slight decrease of the beam fwhm from 30  to 23  . with three bolometers at the focus of the telescope",
    ", there is no more one detector on the central optical axis .",
    "the 30 meter telescope focus being of nasmyth type , the rotation of the field has to be taken into account in the sky maps reconstruction .",
    "rxj1347 - 1145 has been observed in december 1997 .",
    "the center of our observations is the rosat - hri x - ray emission center reported by schindler ( @xcite ) : @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the observations have been performed using the wobbling secondary mirror of the iram telescope at a frequency of 1  hz and with a modulation amplitude of 150  .",
    "an elementary observation sequence is a @xmath18 map in right ascension - declination coordinates for a duration of 277 seconds each .",
    "this is obtained using the right ascension drift provided by the earth rotation so that the telescope could be kept fixed during the measurement .",
    "this was done to minimize microphonic noises and electromagnetic influences from the motors driving the iram 30 m antenna .",
    "the map of the cluster is obtained by stepping in declination between two consecutive lines .",
    "the line length is 120  with a step of 5  .",
    "the wobbling is horizontal , thus not aligned with the scan direction .",
    "however , the wobbling amplitude is large enough for the reference field to be always far out of the cluster . in order to remove systematic signal drifts that are produced by the antenna environment",
    ", we used alternatively the positive and negative beam to map the cluster .",
    "we performed 208 such individual maps on the cluster , for a total duration of 16 hours .",
    "another target of the diabolo s 1997 run was the direction of the decrement detected at 8.44  ghz by richards ( @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this source as vla1312 + 4237 in the following .",
    "richards ( @xcite ) measured a flux decrement of @xmath19jy in a 30  beam .",
    "the presence of two quasars in this direction led them claim to the possible existence of a cluster at a redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "campos ( @xcite ) have reported the detection of a concentration of ly@xmath21-emitting candidates around the quasars .",
    "they argued that the probability for such a clustering to be random is @xmath22 .",
    "our pointing direction was @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we performed 287 individual maps on this target for a total time of about 20 hours .",
    "the reduction procedure includes the following main steps : ( i ) we remove cosmic ray impacts .",
    "( ii ) a synchronous demodulation algorithm is applied taking into account the wobbling secondary frequency and amplitude .",
    "( iii ) we remove from the 2.1 mm bolometer time line the signal which is correlated with the 1.2 mm bolometer looking at the same sky pixel .",
    "this correlated signal is mainly due to the atmospheric emission , which spectral color is very different from the sz effect .",
    "( iv ) correction for opacity is done from the bolometer total power measurements and its calibration by skydips .",
    "( v ) to eliminate the low frequency detector noises , a baseline is subtracted to each line of the map . the baseline is a 1 degree polynomial .",
    "it is fitted to 60% of the data points : 30% at each end of the line . ( vi )",
    "each map is then resampled on a regular right - ascension / declination grid , taking into account the field rotation in the nasmyth focal plane . (",
    "vii ) an average map is computed for each bolometer . since the weather conditions were not permanently ideal , the noise quality of the individual maps is not homogeneous , particularly at 1.2 mm .",
    "we thus exclude from the average the maps which rms pixel to pixel fluctuation is larger than 1.5 times the median rms value of all the individual maps .",
    "( viii ) a single map is then produced for each channel ( 1.2 mm and 2.1 mm ) by coaddition of the three bolometer average maps .    during the run ,",
    "pointing verifications and mapping of reference sources have been performed .",
    "we have used the planet mars as a calibration target .",
    "the apparent angular diameter of mars was 5  , so that we can consider it as a point source with respect to the diabolo s beam .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute calibration obtained is of order of 25% at 1.2 mm and 15% at 2.1 mm .",
    "mars observations are also used for the characterization of the diabolo s beams .",
    "the measured fwhm are 24  and 22  at 1.2 mm and 2.1 mm respectively .",
    "mars has been observed in an azimuth - elevation mapping mode with a scanning speed which is slower than the natural drift speed of the cluster observation mode .",
    "this later speed is fast enough compared to the wobbler period to significantly spread the signal in the scanning direction ( i.e. right ascension ) .",
    "the resulting beam fwhm for the cluster mode along this direction is 28  .",
    "it has been experimentally determined by observation of a quasar lying at about the same declination as the cluster .",
    "the final map of rxj1347 - 1145 at 2.1 mm is shown on fig .",
    "the x - ray contours have been overplotted . the average right - ascension profile at 2.1 mm is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the profile obtained for the vla1312 + 4237 direction using the same data processing , has been overplotted .",
    "the map and the profiles have been smoothed with a gaussian filter of 25  fwhm to maximize the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the 2.1 mm rxj1347 - 1145 map presents a very strong decrement . for a thermal sz effect",
    "this corresponds to a comptonization parameter of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "the decrement that we measure is not centered on the cluster x - ray maximum .",
    "we will show in the analysis that this effect can be explained by the superposition of the sz decrement from the intracluster gas and a positive emission from a known radio source slightly shifted west off the cluster center .",
    "we have no detection for the direction of vla 1312 + 4237 .",
    "our @xmath26 upper limit is @xmath27 .",
    "this is actually compatible with the decrement measured by richards ( @xcite ) which translates to a central comptonization parameter of the order of @xmath28 for a thermal sz effect .",
    "if this decrement is in fact due to a kinetic sz effect then we expect a signal at 2.1 mm which is equivalent to a thermal sz effect of @xmath29 , still within our @xmath26 limit .",
    "actually , we have used the vla1312 + 4237 data set to obtain a reliable assessment of the error bars on rxj1347 - 1145 .",
    "the individual maps have been averaged over increasing durations to evaluate the effective scatter of the average signal over independent data sets .",
    "the maximum duration that could be checked with this method is about 5 hours , corresponding to an average of 64 individual maps .",
    "we have checked that for all bolometers the rms pixel noise scales as the square root of the integration time .",
    "the error bars extrapolated from this analysis to longer integration times are consistent with the error bars derived from the internal scatter of the data averaged for rxj1347 - 1145 .",
    "the typical sensitivity reached in the 2.1 mm channel is of the order of 1 mjy in a 25  beam .",
    "in the following , we have used for the intracluster gas density a spherical @xmath30 model with the parameter values derived from the x - ray analysis of schindler ( @xcite ) : core radius @xmath31arcsec ( 57kpc ) , @xmath32 , central density @xmath33  @xmath12 , and temperature @xmath34  kev .",
    "we choose to cut off this distribution at radial distance of @xmath35 .",
    "we assume the same cosmological parameters too , @xmath36km / s / mpc and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "with such a model the measured sz skymap reads :      where @xmath40 , is the comptonization parameter towards the cluster center . @xmath41 being the @xmath30 radial distribution of the gas density .",
    "@xmath42 is the normalized diabolo band spectral efficiency ( given in desert @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the spectral density of the thermal sz distortion for a unit comptonization parameter , including the relativistic weak dependence on @xmath44 ( see pointecouteau , giard & barret @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for a 9.3 kev cluster , the use of relativistic spectra avoids making errors on the sz flux estimations of 45% and 10% at 1.2 and 2.1 mm respectively .",
    "we did not include any kinetic sz contribution which is generally weak ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the bolztman constant , the electron mass , the speed of light and the thomson cross - section .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the normalized angular distributions of the cluster and the experimental beam respectively .",
    "@xmath49 has no analytical expression , it is numerically computed by integration of the gas density beta profile on the line of sight .",
    "two radio sources are known from the nrao vla sky survey in the neighborhood of the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "one , at @xmath51 , is very close to the cluster center and is likely to correspond to the central cd galaxy .",
    "komatsu ( @xcite ) have compiled observations of this radio source at 1.4  ghz , 28.5  ghz and 105  ghz .",
    "they have derived the following power law for the radiosource spectrum : @xmath52  mjy .",
    "so , the extrapolated millimeter flux should be @xmath53and @xmath54 .    to properly analyze the data , we have performed a realistic simulation of the diabolo observations on the sky map of the sz model ( eq .  [ model ] ) .",
    "the whole set of observed individual maps has been simulated taking into account the 150  wobbling amplitude and the proper sky rotation at the nasmyth focus .",
    "the simulated data have been processed through the same pipe - line as the observed data set to obtain averaged model maps .    finally , using this simulated data set , we have simultaneously fitted the sz decrement amplitude and the point source flux on the 2.1 mm profile with @xmath55 and @xmath56 as free parameters .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath57 and @xmath58with a reduced @xmath59 of 1.3 .",
    "results are given at 68% confidence level .",
    "the absolute calibration error , 25% and 15% at 1.2 mm and 2.1 mm , is not included .",
    "@xmath56 is compatible with the value expected from radio observations .",
    "the best fit is overplotted on the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it reproduces the asymmetric profile .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the point source contribution which fills part of the sz decrement .    in a second time",
    ", we have fixed the radio point source flux at the expected value deduced from komatsu ( @xcite ) , @xmath60 , and we have fitted with a maximum likelihood method both the central comptonization parameter @xmath55 , and the angular core radius @xmath61 .",
    "we have found @xmath62 and @xmath63arcsec with a reduced @xmath59 of 1.2 .",
    "the comptonisation parameter value is consistent with the previous one .",
    "the angular core radius is consistent with the x - ray value within the 68% confidence level .",
    "we confirm through our sz detection that rxj1347 - 1145 is an extremely massive and hot cluster .",
    "we have measured the deepest sz effect ever observed .",
    "it corresponds to a very large comptonization parameter , @xmath57 .",
    "this is almost twice the value expected from the x - ray data , @xmath64 if we use the cluster gas parameters derived by schindler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . although our result points to a mass higher than the x - ray mass , as is the case for gravitational lenses measurements , the uncertainties do not allow to firmly conclude to a discrepancy .",
    "the x - ray flux toward the cluster center is actually dominated by the very strong cooling flow in the core .",
    "the average temperature of the gas which contributes to the sz effect is thus likely to be higher than the temperature derived from the x - ray data , @xmath65 kev .",
    "the gas temperature needed to produce the thermal sz effect we have observed is @xmath2  kev , assuming all other parameters are kept unchanged . in a re - analysis which takes into account the heterogeneity of the cluster , allen and fabian ( @xcite ) have actually derived for this cluster a very high gas temperature : @xmath66 kev , which is indeed consistent with our measurement . under the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", a higher gas temperature implies a higher total cluster mass , thus decreasing the gas fraction if all other cluster parameters are kept unchanged . for @xmath2",
    "kev the total mass of rxj1347 - 1145 within 1  mpc is considerable , @xmath67  m@xmath68 and the corresponding gas fraction is @xmath5 .",
    "we are very grateful to the iram staff at pico veleta for their help during observations .",
    "we thank laurent ravera for very useful comments during the data analysis phase .",
