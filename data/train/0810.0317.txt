    "the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) is unresolved x - ray emission along the galactic plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous observations with several x - ray satellites have revealed spectral characteristics of the grxe .",
    "the grxe spectrum exhibits emission lines from highly ionized si , s and fe , and the 310 kev continuum spectrum is represented by a thin thermal emission model with a temperature of @xmath0510 kev @xcite .",
    "additionally , a significant excess from the thermal emission is found above 10 kev @xcite .",
    "spatial distribution of the grxe is very similar to the galactic structure @xcite , and traces near infrared emission @xcite .",
    "fluctuation analysis using the asca data has given a constraint on the x - ray point sources contributing to the grxe : the number density is larger than 110 ( 3@xmath23@xmath3)@xmath4 and the averaged flux is smaller than 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 @xmath6 @xcite . if the unresolved faint x - ray sources are located in the 4 kpc arm , number of the sources in the galaxy ( @xmath7 ) and their luminosity ( @xmath8 ) should be @xmath91.4@xmath1010@xmath11 and @xmath12 erg s@xmath4 ( 210 kev ) , respectively @xcite . meanwhile , a deep observation with chandra resolved only @xmath010 % or @xmath13 of the grxe flux into discrete sources with an x - ray flux ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath15 erg s@xmath4 @xmath6 in the 210 kev band ( ebisawa et al .",

    "while our observational knowledge on the grxe has significantly increased since its discovery , origin of the grxe remains unsolved .",
    "the most important issue is whether the grxe is truly diffuse emission or composition of numerous faint x - ray sources .",
    "however , in either way , problems still remain : if the diffuse origin is right , the hot plasma gas having a huge thermal energy ( @xmath17 erg , a filling factor = 1 ) is hard to be confined by the galactic gravity .",
    "what is the mechanism to produce and maintain such a hot plasma gas in the galaxy ? on the other hand , if the point source model is correct , what kind of sources are they ?",

    ", distribution of the 6.4 kev line intensity is expected to be spatially correlated with that of the molecular cloud , which may be observable in future .",

    "magnetic cvs ( polars and intermediate polars ) , a subclass of cvs , are efficient x - ray emitters with luminosities of @xmath010@xmath9010@xmath91 erg s@xmath4 , while the majority of cvs are non magnetic cvs , faint x - ray sources with luminosities of @xmath010@xmath92 erg s@xmath4 .",

    "suzaku results of dwarf novae , ss cyg and v893 sco @xcite suggest that their fe line features are similar to those of magnetic cvs . comparing the fe line features of the grxe with those of cvs , we found that the 6.7 kev line ew of the grxe ( @xmath0300980 ev ) is larger than that of cvs , but the fe line properties are similar to each other .",

    "the longitudinal distribution of the grxe shows a strong enhancement within the area of @xmath9330@xmath22 @xcite , which corresponds to the galactic inner disk with a radius of 4 kpc . for simplicity",

    "we also carried out the same estimation using the 6.7 kev line .",
    "if we assume the mean ew of the 6.7 kev line from cvs to be 200 ev , the 6.7 kev line luminosity is estimated to be @xmath02 % of the 210 kev luminosity .",
    "then , using the observed fe line surface brightness from the grxe , the required cv space density is calculated to be ( 2.621)@xmath1010@xmath102 pc@xmath103 .",
    "the estimated cv space densities are larger than that of cvs observed in the solar neighborhood so far ( @xmath10410@xmath105 pc@xmath103 , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "taking account of uncertainties of the current estimation of the cv space density in the galaxy , we can not completely rule out the possibility that a large number of cvs are hiding inside the galaxy . or ,",
    "if the mean luminosity of cvs turns out to be significantly larger than 10@xmath90 erg s@xmath4 , the required cv space density can be much lower . for more precise estimation ,",
    "construction of the luminosity function and a realistic model of the source distribution in the galaxy are needed .",
    "detailed measurements of the fe line features of cvs are also useful . in any case , if the cv origin is correct , the reflection profile by the compton scattering and the line broadening are expected , because the 6.4 kev emission line of cvs is emitted from the white dwarf surface and/or the accreting matter .",
    "a systematic energy shift of @xmath02 ev by the gravitational redshift is also expected .",
    "these features would be revealed by future x - ray micro - calorimeter missions .",
    "the 6.7 kev line is clearly found in all the grxe and gcdx spectra , while the intensities of the @xmath06.4 kev and @xmath07 kev lines relative to that of the @xmath06.7 kev line seems to vary from field to field ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows that there are some differences in the line flux ratios , although the errors are large .",
    "in particular , the line flux ratios of the gcdx are systematically larger than those of the grxe",
    ". the 6.4 kev line would originate from a non thermal process . here , we focus on the flux ratios of the other two lines in the thermal origin , the 6.97 kev/6.7 kev lines .    in order to examine the hypothesis that the line flux ratios observed at all the positions are the same , we fitted all the 6.97 kev/6.7 kev line flux ratios ( gc14 and r18 ) with a constant model and obtained the reduced @xmath106 value of 2.90 ( the degree of freedom of 11 ) .",
    "this means that the hypothesis is statistically rejected .",
    "furthermore , the weighted mean values of the 6.97 kev/6.7 kev line flux ratio of the gcdx and the grxe are 0.38@xmath430.02 and 0.22@xmath430.06 ( 90% confidence level ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the line flux ratio of the grxe is not the same as that of the gcdx .",
    "based on the apec model in xspec , the mean ratio for the gcdx ( 0.38 ) is corresponding to @xmath07 kev , while that for the grxe ( 0.22 ) is @xmath05.5 kev .",
    "we also applied the same analysis to only the grxe data ( r18 ) and obtained the reduced @xmath106 value of 0.49 ( the degree of freedom of 7 ) . from the statistical point of view , all the line flux ratio of the grxe is considered to be the same . to examine the difference in the line ratios for the grxe",
    ", we need good statistics data and more samples of the grxe .",
    "if the grxe and the gcdx are composition of numerous faint x - ray sources , the spectra should be an averaged spectrum of the x - ray sources contributing to the grxe and the gcdx . according to the results of the fluctuation analysis of the asca data @xcite , more than 10@xmath107 faint sources responsible for the grxe",
    "should be included in the xis fov . in the case of the gcdx",
    ", the number of contributing sources should be larger because the 6.7 kev and 6.97 kev line fluxes of the gcdx are more than 10 times larger than those of the grxe .",
    "hence , the grxe and the gcdx spectra observed in the various regions are expected to be quite similar to each other .",
    "the difference in the 6.97 kev/6.7 kev line flux ratio suggests that at least the candidate sources in the gc region have a higher temperature plasma emission than those on the galactic plane systematically .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the grxe has the diffuse origin , the difference in the line flux ratio of 6.97 kev/6.7 kev can be explained by spatial difference of the plasma temperature .",
    "if the hot plasma is produced by a process concerning the activity in the galactic scale , the temperature distribution may be correlated with the galactic structure .",
    "for example , the temperatures in the central parts are expected to be higher , while those in the outer regions and the off - plane regions are relatively low , which qualitatively agrees with the observation .",
    "more precise systematic study of the spatial distribution of the fe lines is expected to give the answer in future .",
    "we analyzed suzaku data taken at various regions along the galactic plane and studied their fe - k emission line features .",
    "suzaku resolved the fe line complex into three narrow lines at @xmath06.4 kev , @xmath06.7 kev and @xmath06.97 kev , which are k - lines from neutral ( or low - ionized ) , he - like , and h - like iron ions , respectively . the 6.7 kev line is clearly seen in all the observed regions and the 6.4 kev emission line was also found in various galactic plane regions .",
    "the 6.4 kev/6.7 kev and the 6.97 kev/6.7 kev line flux ratios of the gcdx are found to be systematically larger than those of the grxe .",
    "authors are grateful to all the members of the suzaku team .",
