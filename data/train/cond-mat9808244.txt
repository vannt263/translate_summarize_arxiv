    "if it is true that scaling laws abound in nature  @xcite , then river networks stand as a superb epitome of this phenomenon . for over half a century",
    ", researchers have uncovered numerous power laws and scaling behaviors in the mathematical description of river networks  @xcite .",
    "these scaling laws , which are usually parameterized by exponents or ratios of fundamental quantities , have been used to validate scores of numerical and theoretical models of landscape evolution  @xcite and have even been invoked as evidence of self - organized criticality  @xcite . however , despite this widespread usage , there is as yet no fundamental understanding of the origin of scaling laws in river networks .",
    "it is the principal aim of this paper to bring together a large family of these scaling laws within a simple , logical framework .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that from a base of three assumptions regarding network geometry , all scaling laws involving planform quantities may be obtained . the worth of these consequent scaling laws is then seen to rest squarely upon the shoulders of the structural assumptions themselves .",
    "we also simplify the relations between the derived laws , demonstrating that only two scaling exponents are independent .",
    "the paper is composed in the following manner .",
    "we first present preliminary definitions of network quantities and a list of empirically observed scaling laws .",
    "our assumptions will next be fully stated along with evidence for their validity .",
    "several sections will then detail the derivations of the various scaling laws , being a combination of both new insights of our own as well as previous results .",
    "progressing in a systematic way from our assumptions , we will also be required to amend several inconsistencies persistent in other analyses .",
    "the theory will be tested with comparisons to data taken from real landscapes and scheidegger s random network model  @xcite .",
    "a basic tool used in the analysis of river networks is the device of stream ordering .",
    "a stream ordering is any scheme that attaches levels of significance to streams throughout a basin .",
    "most orderings identify the smallest tributaries as lowest order streams and the main or ` trunk ' stream as being of highest order with the intermediary ` stream segments ' spanning this range in some systematic fashion .",
    "stream orderings allow for logical comparisons between different parts of a network and provide a basic language for the description of network structure .    here",
    ", we build our theory using the most common ordering scheme , one that was first introduced by horton in his seminal work on erosion  @xcite .",
    "strahler later improved this method  @xcite and the resulting technique is commonly referred to as horton - strahler stream ordering  @xcite .",
    "the most natural description of this stream ordering , due to melton  @xcite , is based on an iterative pruning of a tree representing a network as shown in figure  [ fig : scaling.order ] .",
    "all source ( or external ) streams are pared away from the tree , these being defined as the network s first order ` stream segments ' .",
    "a new tree is thus created along with a new collection of source streams and these are precisely the second order stream segments of the original network",
    ". the pruning and order identification continues in like fashion until only the trunk stream segment of the river network is left .",
    "the overall order of the basin itself is identified with the highest stream order present .",
    "the usual and equivalent description details how stream orders change at junctions  @xcite .",
    "when a stream segment of order @xmath0 merges with a stream segment of order @xmath1 , the outgoing stream will have an order of @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kronecker delta .",
    "in other words , stream order only increases when two stream segments of the same order come together and , otherwise , the highest order is maintained by the outflowing stream .",
    "the results of this paper pertain to networks as viewed in planform . as such ,",
    "any effects involving relief , the vertical dimension , are ignored .",
    "nevertheless , we show that a coherent theory of planform quantities may still be obtained .",
    "this section defines the relevant quantities and their various permutations along with scaling laws observed to hold between them .",
    "the descriptions of these laws will be short and more detail will be provided in later sections .",
    "the two essential features in river networks are basins and the streams that drain them .",
    "the two basic planform quantities associated with these are drainage area and stream length .",
    "an understanding of the distribution of these quantities is of fundamental importance in geomorphology . drainage area , for example , serves as a measure of average discharge of a basin while its relationship with the length of the main stream gives a sense of how basins are shaped .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling.planformq ] shows a typical drainage basin .",
    "the basin features are @xmath5 , the area , @xmath6 , the length of the main stream , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the overall dimensions .",
    "the main ( or trunk ) stream is the dominant stream of the network ",
    "it is traced out by moving all the way upstream from the outlet to the start of a source stream by choosing at each junction ( or fork ) the incoming stream with the largest drainage area .",
    "this is not to be confused with stream segment length which only makes sense in the context of stream ordering .",
    "we will usually write @xmath9 for @xmath7 .",
    "note that any point on a network has its own basin and associated main stream .",
    "the sub - basin in figure  [ fig : scaling.planformq ] illustrates this and has its own primed versions of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling laws usually involve comparisons between basins of varying size .",
    "these basins must be from the same landscape and may or may not be contained within each other .",
    "several scaling laws connect these quantities .",
    "one of the most well known is hack s law  @xcite .",
    "hack s law states that @xmath6 scales with @xmath5 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is often referred to as hack s exponent .",
    "the important feature of hack s law is that @xmath12 . in particular",
    ", it has been observed that for a reasonable span of basin sizes that @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the actual range of this scaling is an unresolved issue with some studies demonstrating that very large basins exhibit the more expected scaling of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "we simply show later that while the assumptions of this paper hold so too does hack s law .",
    "further comparisons of drainage basins of different sizes yield scaling in terms of @xmath15 , the overall basin length . area , main stream length , and basin width are all observed to scale with @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath16    turning our attention to the entire landscape , it is also observed that histograms of stream lengths and basin areas reveal power law distributions  @xcite : @xmath17    there are any number of other definable quantities and we will limit ourselves to a few that are closely related to each other .",
    "we write @xmath18 for the average distance from a point on the network to the outlet of a basin ( along streams ) and @xmath19 for the unnormalized total of these distances . a minor variation of these are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where only distances from junctions in the network to the outlet are included in the averages .",
    "the scaling law involving these particular quantities is langbein s law  @xcite which states that @xmath22 similarly , we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xcite .      with the introduction of stream ordering , a whole new collection of network quantities appear . here , we present the most important ones and discuss them in the context of what we identify as the principal structural laws of river networks : tokunaga s law and horton s laws .",
    "tokunaga s law concerns the set of ratios , @xmath26 , first introduced by tokunaga  @xcite .",
    "these ` tokunaga ratios ' represent the average number of streams of order @xmath27 flowing into a stream of order @xmath2 as side tributaries . in the case of what we will call a ` structurally self - similar network '",
    ", we have that @xmath28 where @xmath29 since quantities involving comparisons between features at different scales should only depend on the relative separation of those scales .",
    "these @xmath30 , in turn , are observed to be dependent such that  @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a fixed constant for a given network .",
    "thus , all of tokunaga s ratios may be specified by two fundamental parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 : @xmath34 we refer to this last identity as tokunaga s law .",
    "the network parameter @xmath33 is the average number of major side tributaries per stream segment .",
    "so for a collection of stream segments of order @xmath2 , there will be on average @xmath33 side tributaries of order @xmath35 for each stream segment .",
    "the second network parameter @xmath32 describes how numbers of side tributaries of successively lower orders increase , again , on average . as an example , consider that the network in figure  [ fig : scaling.order ] is part of a much larger network for which @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling.order ]  ( b ) shows that the third order stream segment has two major side tributaries of second order which fits exactly with @xmath36 ( note that the two second order stream segments that come together to create the third order stream segment are not side tributaries ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling.order ]  ( a ) further shows nine first order tributaries , slightly above the average eight suggested by @xmath38 . finally , again referring to figure  [ fig : scaling.order ]  ( a ) , there are @xmath39 first order tributaries for each second order stream segment , not far from the expected number @xmath36 .",
    "horton introduced several important measurements for networks in conjunction with his stream ordering  @xcite .",
    "the first is the bifurcation ratio , @xmath40 .",
    "this is the ratio of the number @xmath41 of streams of order @xmath42 to the number @xmath43 of streams of order @xmath44 and is , moreover , observed to be independent of @xmath42 over a large range .",
    "there is next the stream length ratio , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the average length of stream segments of order @xmath2 .",
    "these lengths only exist within the context of stream ordering .",
    "in contrast to these are the main stream lengths , which we have denoted by @xmath6 and described in section  [ sec : scaling.genquants ] .",
    "main stream lengths are defined regardless of stream ordering and , as such , are a more natural quantity . note that stream ordering gives rise to a discrete set of basins , one for each junction in the network .",
    "we therefore also have a set of basin areas and main stream lengths defined at each junction .",
    "taking averages over basins of the same order we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 to add to the previously defined @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the connection between the two measures of stream length is an important , if simple , exercise  @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath51 holds for all @xmath42 , one has @xmath52 where @xmath53 has been used .",
    "since typically @xmath54  @xcite , @xmath55 rapidly . for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the error is only three per cent . on the other hand ,",
    "starting with the assumption that main stream lengths satisfy horton s law of stream lengths for all @xmath42 implies that the same is true for stream segments .",
    "thus , for most calculations , horton s law of stream lengths may involve either stream segments or main streams and , for convenience , we will assume that the law is fully satisfied by the former .",
    "furthermore , this small calculation suggests that studies involving only third- or fourth - order networks can not be presumed to have reached asymptotic regimes of scaling laws .",
    "we will return to this point throughout the paper .",
    "schumm  @xcite is attributed with the concrete introduction of a third and final law that was also suggested by horton .",
    "this last ratio is for drainage areas and states that @xmath58 .",
    "we will later show in section  [ sec : scaling.ra = rn ] that our assumptions lead to the result that @xmath59 . at this stage , however , we write horton s laws as the three statements @xmath60    a summary of all of the scaling laws presented in this section is provided in table  [ tab : scaling.scalinglaws ] .",
    "empirically observed values for the relevant exponents and ratios are presented in table  [ tab : scaling.values ] .",
    ".a general list of scaling laws for river networks .",
    "all laws and quantities are defined in section  [ sec : scaling.defs ] .",
    "the principal finding of this paper is that these scaling laws follow from the first two relations , tokunaga s law ( structural self - similarity ) and the self - affinity of single channels , and the assumption of uniform drainage density ( defined in section  [ sec : scaling.assumptionsdd ] ) .
