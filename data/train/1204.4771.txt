    "since the inclusive flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the standard model ( sm ) can only be induced through box and electroweak penguin diagrams , the corresponding exclusive ones , such as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are highly suppressed as rare decays .",
    "experimental searches for these rare decays could shed light to find new physics .",
    "for example , as the current experimental upper bound on the decay branching ratio of @xmath8 is @xmath9  @xcite , while its sm prediction is @xmath10  @xcite , there would exist some kind of new physics @xcite between the sandwiched area",
    ". moreover , for the decay of @xmath11 with an on - shell @xmath12 , some physical observables  @xcite are also available to test t - violating effects beyond the sm .",
    "when the experimental sensitivities are gradually improved , even the decays of @xmath13 via @xmath5 with an additional suppression of @xmath14 can also function as probes for new physics .    in this report",
    ", we propose to use the baryonic modes of @xmath15 ( @xmath7 ) as a new type of the exclusive @xmath3 decays via @xmath16 to examine fcncs . to simplify our discussions on the baryonic form factors",
    ", we will concentrate on the four - body semileptonic baryonic decay of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we will study its decay branching ratio in the sm .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0 can be well reconstructed experimentally since the charged @xmath17 along with @xmath18 from @xmath19 can be easily detected .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 has several interesting features .",
    "first , as a four - body decay , the observables for angular distribution asymmetries can be constructed as a probe to right - handed vector as well as ( pseudo-)scalar currents beyond the sm .",
    "second , by keeping the @xmath19 spin @xmath20 , we are able to construct a t - odd observable @xmath21 with the @xmath22 momentum @xmath23 to test time reversal violation . as the basis to study new physics , @xmath24 in the sm",
    "can be naively estimated to be of order @xmath25 .",
    "this is in comparison with the @xmath26 via @xmath27 being 100 times bigger than @xmath28 , while the predicted @xmath29 is of order @xmath30 to @xmath31 @xcite . in order to precisely calculate the decay , a knowledge of the matrix elements for the @xmath32 transition",
    "is needed , which is difficult to obtain in qcd . however , since @xmath0 is considered to associate with the three - body baryonic @xmath33 decays of @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 via the @xmath36 transitions , the solution can be simply made .",
    "the parameterizations for the @xmath36 transitions in @xcite can be reliably adopted , as the theoretical studies of @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite relating the @xmath36 transitions are approved to agree with the data @xcite .",
    "in addition , with the @xmath40 transition , the @xmath41 violation for @xmath42 @xcite is found to be nearly 20% of the world average @xcite even though it is still inconclusive experimentally due to the data errors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ fig3]a , we see that @xmath85 receives the dominant contribution near the threshold of @xmath109 , when the curve sharply peaks in the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this reflects the fact of @xmath65 as the momentum dependence in the @xmath32 transition form factors .",
    "in contrast , the curve in the @xmath110 spectrum is associated with the total energy of the @xmath83 pair .",
    "this is due to the helicity structure of @xmath111 in the amplitude , formed as @xmath112 with @xmath113 the left - handed polarization .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath113 couples to the left - handed helicity state of the virtual @xmath114 boson results in a factor of @xmath115 to explain the angular distribution for @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . as a duplicate case",
    ", @xmath102 has the same helicity structure for the lepton pair to couple to the left - handed helicity state of the virtual weak boson @xmath117 . as a result",
    ", it is reasonable to have @xmath118 in table [ tab1 ] . on the other hand , since @xmath85 can be traced back to the tensor terms @xmath119 in the @xmath120 transition , which give the main contributions , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are too small to provide factors of @xmath123 as apparent angular dependent terms , as given in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b for @xmath124 and table  [ tab1 ] for @xmath125 .",
    "the domination of the tensor terms @xmath119 in the @xmath120 transition can be realized .",
    "the terms @xmath126 disappear due to @xmath113 with @xmath127 , leading to the coupling of @xmath128 . because of the relatively small value of @xmath129 , the terms @xmath130 are negligible .",
    "the suppression for @xmath131 is in accordance with the limit of @xmath132 as the invariant mass @xmath133 approaches the threshold area to receive the main contribution for @xmath85 ( see fig . [ fig3]a ) .",
    "moreover , with an additional @xmath134 in @xmath135 , the ratio of @xmath136 to @xmath137 , which is equal to @xmath138 , can be enhanced by @xmath139 around the threshold area .",
    "these explain why @xmath119 prevail over the other terms in the @xmath101 decay .",
    "since the decays of @xmath102 and @xmath101 are similar four - body decays , we suggest a relation , given by @xmath140 where the factor 3 comes from the three neutrino flavors and @xmath141 is due to the constants of their own hamiltonian and the form factor for @xmath119 . when the invariant masses @xmath142 and @xmath133 are close to 1.877 and 2.054 gev@xmath143 for @xmath102 and @xmath101 , respectively , the curves are drawn to be at the top in the spectra .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath144 , which agrees with the numerical result @xmath145 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the measurement for @xmath146 can be a test of @xmath65 as the momentum dependence of the @xmath36 transition form factors in eqs .",
    "( [ transitionf ] ) and ( [ figi ] ) .    due to the rich spin structure in the final state",
    ", the baryonic decay of @xmath101 is clearly quite different from the mesonic one of @xmath147 .",
    "the spin effect is sensitive to some new physics .",
    "for example , the angular distributions in @xmath101 can be used to probe for right - handed and ( pseudo-)scalar currents beyond the sm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the invisible scalar ( s ) decay has been studied for the mesonic decays of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "similar studies can be extended to the baryonic modes here .",
    "in particular , we would like to emphasize that to test the invisible scalar pair @xmath150 from the @xmath151 via the ( pseudo-)scalar couplings , @xmath0 can be more beneficial than @xmath149 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the angular distributions in @xmath152 and @xmath153 are both angular - symmetric , one can not distinguish them from the angular analysis .",
    "however , the situation for the baryonic decays are different .",
    "recall that the large angular asymmetry observed to be @xmath154 in the @xmath155 decay  @xcite has been attributed to the @xmath36 transition via the ( pseudo-)scalar couplings  @xcite . since the decay of @xmath156 through @xmath151 has the same type of the @xmath36 transition",
    ", we expect it to be largely angular - asymmetric , whereas @xmath157 is predicted to be as small as 1  % . if the integrated angular asymmetry in @xmath156 is 50% , to measure it at the @xmath158 level , about @xmath159 are required , which should be accessible to the future b factories .",
    "finally , we remark that in @xmath160 , as the spins and momentums may not be on the same plane , similar to the cases in the @xmath97 decays  @xcite , @xmath161-odd triple product correlations ( tpc s ) , such as @xmath162 and @xmath163 with @xmath20 denoting the @xmath19 spin , can be generated . in the sm , since the decay depends on @xmath46 , which contains no cp phase , these t - odd observables are expected to be vanishingly small . however , they can be used to test direct @xmath161 violating effects from new particles .",
    "we have studied the four - body semileptonic baryonic decay of @xmath0 based on the effective hamiltonian for @xmath4 , arising from electroweak penguin and box diagrams in the sm .",
    "we have calculated the decay branching ratio and angular distribution asymmetries for the decay .",
    "explicitly , we have found that @xmath164 .",
    "we have also obtained a useful relation between the decays of @xmath165 and @xmath102 .",
    "similar to the rare mesonic decays of @xmath2 , the experimental search for the rare baryonic decay of @xmath165 in the current as well as future @xmath3 factories is useful to test the sm and limit new physics .",
