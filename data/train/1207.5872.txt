    "the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) is the first dedicated very long naseline interferometry ( vlbi ) network in east asia in millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the kvn was built by korea astronomy and space science institute ( kasi ) in order to achieve the following major goals : ( 1 )  to study the formation and death of stars with observing water ( h@xmath3o ) , methanol ( ch@xmath4oh ) , and silicon monoxide ( sio ) masers at high resolutions , ( 2 )  to investigate the structure and dynamics of our own galaxy by conducting highly accurate astrometric vlbi observations of the galactic radio sources , and ( 3 )  to study the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and their population at high frequencies .",
    "the kvn as a dedicated vlbi network also aims to study the spectral and temporal properties of transient sources such as bursting star - forming regions , intra - day variable compact radio sources , gamma - ray flaring agns , and other objects by conducting systematic multi - wavelength monitoring campaigns @xcite    the kvn consists of three 21  m radio telescopes : in seoul , kvn yonsei radio telescope ( kvnys ) , in ulsan , kvn ulsan radio telescope ( kvnus ) ; and in jeju island , korea , kvn tamna radio telescope ( kvntn ) .",
    "the baseline lengths are in a range of 305476  km ( see figure[f : kvn_map ] ) .",
    "all antennas have an identical design . the aggregate root mean square ( rms ) deviation of the antenna surface from a paraboloid is 0.12  mm , which allows us to observe at frequencies up to 150  ghz .",
    "the antennas are equipped with the quasi - optic system that allows simultaneous observations at 22 , 43 , 86 , and 129  ghz .",
    "this system is described in detail in @xcite .    by 2011 ,",
    "the 22 and 43  ghz receivers were installed and carefully tested .",
    "the dual beams at two frequencies are well aligned within @xmath5 .",
    "the pointing errors are less than @xmath6 in azimuth and elevation .",
    "the measured aperture efficiencies are greater than 64% at 22  ghz and greater than 62% at 43  ghz .",
    "more detailed results of performance tests of the antenna and receivers in the single - dish mode are presented in @xcite .",
    "receivers at 86 and 129  ghz will be tested in 2012 .",
    "the signals digitized by the samplers in the receiver room are processed by the kvn data acquisition system ( das ) to get spectra for single - dish spectroscopy observations . in vlbi operation , the digitized signals processed in the das are recorded onto disks using mark-5b . in 2011 the aggregate recording rate was limited by 1024  mbps that can be used either entirely for one band or split between bands .    the kasi has all hardware and software to support _ the full cycle of vlbi observations _ either as a three - element interferometer or as a part of a larger vlbi network : scheduling , antenna control system , data recording , correlation , post - correlation data processing , astrometry , geodesy , and imaging analysis.first fringes between kvn stations at 22  ghz in a recording rate of 1  gbps were obtained on 2010 june 8 .",
    "test observations on 2010 september 30 confirmed that the vlbi system works according to specifications .",
    "detailed analysis of system performance will be given in s.  lee et al .",
    "( 2013 in preparation ) .",
    "these first tests allowed us to start an early science program including multi - frequency phase referencing observations .",
    "the feasibility of the multi - frequency phase referencing observations strongly depends on the information about phase calibrators such as their structures , flux densities , global distribution , etc @xcite .",
    "therefore it is necessary to establish a catalog of radio compact sources at high frequency bands with large vlbi surveys .",
    "this determined our choice for the first early science project for vlbi observations in continuum mode .    in this paper we present results of the 43  ghz vlbi survey conducted at the three - element kvn radio interferometer .",
    "we describe the strategy for source selection , observations , data analysis and present the catalog of correlated flux densities .",
    "finally , we summarize main findings and make conclusions about performance of the kvn for agns studies .",
    "although the accumulative radio fundamental catalog ( l.  petrov & y.  kovalev 2013 , in preparation ) that includes all the sources observed with vlbi in a survey mode by 2012 august has 7216 objects , the majority of them were observed at frequencies 8  ghz and lower .",
    "this catalog is based on very long baseline array ( vlba ) calibrator survey @xcite and other large surveys .",
    "there were only several vlbi surveys at frequencies higher than 24  ghz .",
    "@xcite observed 132 sources at @xmath0-band in 20022003 , @xcite run an ongoing project of monitoring 34  agns since 2007 , and @xcite started to work on the catalog of @xmath7 objects at 32  ghz that will become available in the future . considering that 13  sources overlap in both projects ,",
    "the total number of sources with known @xmath0-band flux densities at milliarcsecond scales with their brightness distributions publicly available is 153 .",
    "this count does not include individual sources that were observed as targets under other programs .",
    "all these sources have the correlated flux density at baselines longer than 900  km , which corresponds to 130  mega wavelengths , greater than 200  mjy .",
    "we would like to increase this list for two reasons .",
    "first , we need to have a set of sources suitable as calibrators for high frequencies with kvn and vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) . observations with quick switching between a weak target and a bright calibrator allow to extend the coherence time from several minutes to hours , provided a calibrator located within several degrees from a target can be detected .",
    "second , construction of a flux - limited sample of sources at high frequencies provides an opportunity to study the population of agns . at frequency 43  ghz and higher the radio emission at parsec scales is dominated by the core .",
    "vlbi observations of a large flux - limited sample allow to derive a number of interesting statistics . in particular",
    ", using such a sample we can    * investigate compactness determined as a ratio of the correlated flux density at short and long baselines to the single - dish flux density and compare it with compactness at 2.2 , 8.4  ghz , and 22  ghz .",
    "* measure the brightness temperature for the core and jet components in order to populate a model of the distribution of the observed core brightness temperature in terms of the intrinsic properties of relativistic jets such as the brightness temperature , bulk motion , viewing angle .",
    "the data will also provide the unbiased sample needed to investigate the unified scheme between quasars , bl lacs objects , and galaxies . *",
    "analyze the relationship between the core optical depth as measured by the spectral index and other properties of the jet emission and optical properties . *",
    "investigate the variation of the spectral index along the presumably optically thin jets and comparison with the conditions in small - scale and larger - scale jets .    to commence building a large sample of compact sources at 43  ghz",
    ", we analyzed prior vlbi surveys at 2224  ghz : the @xmath8/@xmath0 vlba survey @xcite , the vera 22  ghz fringe search survey @xcite , the vlba galactic plane survey @xcite , the evn galactic plane survey @xcite , and the vera @xmath8-band calibrator survey @xcite .",
    "we selected 878 sources in these surveys that have correlated flux densities at scales less than 10  mas exceeding 200  mjy . after subtracting 153 sources that have already been observed in @xmath0-band surveys , we got the list of 725 target sources .",
    "we added to this list two samples of the sources that were not previously observed with vlbi which we could reasonably expect to be bright enough for being detected at @xmath0-band with the kvn .",
    "these additional sources included 49 objects from the cgrabs catalog @xcite , many of them are part of the ovro 40  m telescope monitoring program at 15  ghz @xcite ( other 1576 objects have already been observed with vlbi ) and 26 sources from the at20 g catalog @xcite with spectral index ( @xmath9 ) greater than @xmath10 that have the flux density extrapolated to 43  ghz greater than 200  mjy . in total ,",
    "the list of targets included 799  objects .",
    "we observed target sources in three observing sessions in december 18 , 19 , and 22 , 2011 .",
    "the first two sessions had durations 28 and 27 hr respectively . in the 50 minutes",
    "long third session we observed the sources missed in the first two sessions . each source was scheduled in one scan , 90  s long , in the first observing session and in one scan in the second observing session .",
    "the algorithm for automatic scheduling implemented in software sur_sked selected the sources in a sequence that minimizes slewing .",
    "in addition to target sources , every half an hour a source from the list of 34  blazars that are regularly monitored by the boston group @xcite was inserted .",
    "the scheduling algorithm has picked up 14 blazars .",
    "these bright sources were used for bandpass calibration and for evaluation of station - dependent gain corrections .    every hour a tipping curve was measured : each antenna recorded system temperature at eight different elevations .",
    "these measurements allow us to monitor changes in the opacity of the atmosphere .",
    "the left circular polarization data were recorded using mark-5b units with 2  bit sampling within 496  mhz wide band in a range of 42.85043.346  ghz in 16  intermediate sub - bands of 16  mhz wide , equally spaced with a step of 16  mhz using a digital filter .",
    "the aggregate recording rate was 1024  mbps .",
    "the data were correlated with difx-2 correlator @xcite with spectral resolution of 0.125  mhz and accumulation periods of 1  s long .",
    "the scheme of post - correlator data analysis was similar to the analysis of kcal vera calibrator survey at 22  ghz @xcite .",
    "first , for each observation we found such phase delay rates , group delays , and group delay rates that after coherent averaging of complex cross - correlation samples rotated according to these parameters the fringe amplitude of the sum reached the maxima .",
    "we used analysis software @xmath11   for performing this task .",
    "a dataset that originates from processing data of one scan at one baseline we call an observation .    analyzing the distribution of achieved signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns )",
    ", we found the probability of false detection for observations with no signal , but only noise is less than 0.01 when the s / n is greater than 5.4 .",
    "we used this value of the s /",
    "n as a threshold for a preliminary screening of detected and not detected observations",
    ".    then total group delays and delay rates as well as some auxiliary information was written into a database for further processing with vtd / post - solve software for analysis of absolute astrometry and geodesy observations .",
    "we solved for coordinates of new sources , baseline lengths , clock function and residual atmosphere path delay in zenith direction modeled with a linear b - spline with spans of 1  hr for every station .",
    "this was done for two purposes .",
    "first , we were able to adjust positions of new sources and improve a  priori baseline lengths .",
    "second , considering that for a majority of sources their positions are known at a milliarcsecond level , we can make an additional test whether a given source was detected .",
    "the group delay search window was 8 @xmath12s .",
    "if a source is not detected , its estimate of group delay will be uniformly distributed in a range of @xmath13s .",
    "the distribution of post - fit residuals of detected sources has the weighted root mean squares ( wrms ) 5580  ps . that is why a non - detected source will show up as an outlier .",
    "the probability that a non - detected source which position is not adjusted will accidentally have the post - fit residual greater than 5 times wrms , i.e. , @xmath14  ns , and therefore , will not be marked as an outlier , is @xmath15 .",
    "after additional screening for non - detections by analyzing residuals of parameter estimation and elimination of observations with residuals exceeding five times their wrms we performed the amplitude calibration .",
    "previous measurements of antenna gains showed that they vary with elevation within 5%8% .",

    ", we are not in a position to present evidence that the cumulative list of 776 objects from these two surveys and from   is complete at a certain flux density level .",
    "more observations and meticulous completeness analysis of the parent source list are needed in order to draw a conclusion about completeness of the @xmath0-band sample . at present",
    ", we can firmly say that at least 534 sources have correlated flux densities greater than 200  mjy at projection baseline length of 40  mega wavelengths and 381  objects have correlated flux densities greater than 300  mjy at 3/4 of the celestial sphere with declination @xmath16 -30 @xmath17 .",
    "we can make a coarse estimate of the number of sources with the flux density at @xmath0-band greater than 100  mjy .",
    "we computed the ratios of @xmath0-band correlated flux density to @xmath8-band correlated flux density . for 73dependence of the number of sources @xmath18 at @xmath19 on the @xmath8-band correlated flux density @xmath20 for @xmath21  jy",

    "we get a total expected number to detections : @xmath25 objects .",
    "we selected integration time 90  s for target sources .",
    "however , visual inspection of variations of fringe amplitudes with time for strong sources did not show a sign of decorrelation due to either the atmosphere or the frequency standards .",
    "we re - ran fringe fitting by dropping cross - correlation samples after 45 and after 60  s since the scan nominal start .",
    "if decorrelation due to phase fluctuations caused by the atmosphere path delay or by the frequency standards is negligible , the s / n ratio grows with an increase of averaging time as a square root of time .",
    "deviation from this dependence in a form of @xmath26 provides us a measure of decorrelation @xmath27 .",
    "we found that the average decorrelation factor is 0.99 when the coherence time is increased from 45 to 60  s and 0.98 when the coherence time is increased from 60 to 90  s. this indicates that the coherence time during   survey was significantly longer than 90  s.    considering that ( 1 )  100% of scheduled observations were observed , correlated , and fringe fit ; ( 2 )  no noticeable decorrelation due to either frequency standard or atmosphere was found ; ( 3 )  system temperature was measured for every scan with no abnormalities ; ( 4 )  receiver temperature showed variations within 10% ; ( 5 )  the median detection limit was 110  mjy ; ( 6 )  positions of new sources were determined with median accuracies 20  mas , we regard the early science kvn observations for  project as fully successful .",
    "the major result is the catalog of flux densities of 637 compact sources at 43  ghz .",
    "their errors do not exceed 15% .",
    "the number of sources detected in @xmath0-band surveys grew by a factor of five and reached 776 objects .",
    "integration time 90  s allowed us to detect a 115  mjy source at declination @xmath28 with the probability 90% in the winter season .",
    "we found that our observations were not limited by coherency time of either the atmosphere or the frequency standards .",
    "we may tentatively suggest that the coherence time could be increased to 180  s. we can conclude that the kvn is able to reliably detect at @xmath0-band sources with correlated flux densities greater than 100  mjy , at least in winter time .",
    "more observations are needed in order to judge whether the coherence time during   campaign was representative .",
    "we observed sources at elevations as low as @xmath29 and with declinations as low as @xmath30 .",
    "the detection limit for sources with declinations below @xmath31 was a factor of 1.52 worse that for sources with declinations greater than @xmath32 .",
    "we determined coordinates of 33  new sources that have not been observed before with vlbi .",
    "the median formal position uncertainty from two scans is 20  mas .",
    "comparison of these positions with positions of six sources derived from analysis of vlba observations at 8  ghz in 2012 confirmed that the formal uncertainties are realistic .",
    "observing sources in 1215 scans which requires approximately 30  minutes per source will bring position uncertainty down to 510  mas .",

    "these sources can also be used as phase calibrators for observing much weaker targets . with the use of  results , the probability to find",
    "a calibrator for kvn observations within @xmath33 of any target is 30% .",
