    "the goal of this work is to find candidate very - high - energy ( vhe ) emitters from the sources in the _ fermi _ year-1 catalogue .",
    "many of the sources that have already been detected at vhe are in the catalog so it is already clear that _ fermi _ can provide further targets of interest for vhe observatories .",
    "to begin , a preliminary scan of the catalog was performed to select unassociated sources above galactic latitudes of 10@xmath2 that had potential to be vhe emitters based on their flux , spectra and redshift .",
    "unassociated sources that met the following criteria were selected :      this resulted in a list of 80 candidates corresponding to @xmath1111% of the total number of unassociated sources in the year-1 catalog .",
    "a skymap of these sources in galactic coordinates is shown in figure  [ fig : skymap ] .",
    "these 80 sources were then re - analyzed to search for curvature in their spectra ; the sources in the catalog were all fit with power - law spectra , which gives , to first order , a good indication of their properties across the _ fermi _ energy band but does not always describe accurately their spectra above 1gev .",
    "we included only those data at energies above 1gev from these sources to see if the resulting flux agrees with the power - law fit in the catalog .",
    "for each source , events were selected from a region of 10@xmath13 radius centered on the catalog coordinates for that source .",
    "these data were analyzed using the standard _",
    "analysis software ( ` sciencetools v9r15p3 ; irf p6_v3_diffuse ` ) available from the heasarc .",
    "all of the _ fermi _ sources in the field of view were modeled and the background emission was modeled using a galactic diffuse emission model and an isotropic component @xcite .",
    "events were analyzed using an unbinned maximum likelihood method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sources were modeled using a power law covering two overlapping energy ranges : 100mev-300gev and 1gev-300gev .",
    "in addition , a log parabola covering the full energy range ( 100mev-300gev ) was used to search for curvature .",
    "the differential flux , @xmath14 as a function of energy , @xmath15 , for the power - law and the log - parabola spectral functions are shown in equations  [ eq : powerlaw ] and [ eq : logparabola ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the differential flux at the decorrelation energy , @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the photon index ; @xmath21 is the break energy ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the parameters of the log - parabola fit .",
    "the likelihood values of the power - law and log - parabola fits over the full energy range were compared and a @xmath24 statistical test was used to calculate the probability of curvature in the photon spectrum .",
    "the covariance matrices were used to calculate the 1-sigma confidence intervals of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for each spectral model .",
    "the energy range of the sed starts at 100mev and terminates at the energy of the most energetic photon associated with each source .",
    "figures  [ fig : sedgood ] and [ fig : sedbad ] show sed examples for sources with and without evidence for curvature .              for sources where there was no evidence for curvature ,",
    "the flux above 100mev and the spectral index obtained from the power - law fit were used to estimate the flux in the vhe band ( 200gev-1tev ) .",
    "the _ fermi _ spectrum was extrapolated to higher energies assuming no break in the spectrum and the flux was absorbed for the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) with the model of franceschini et al .",
    "a redshift value of @xmath25=@xmath26 was assumed for all sources .    for those sources where a log - parabola was a better fit , the flux and spectral index obtained using",
    "the power - law fit above 1gev were used for the extrapolation to the vhe band .",
    "given that curvature was detected in the _ fermi _ energy band , it is likely that the predicted tev flux is overly optimistic .",
    "but , given the lack of knowledge about the redshift of these sources , we consider the brightest ones as good  filler \" targets in under - populated ra bands . table  [ tab : list ] lists the 10 most promising unassociated _ fermi _ sources for the vhe band using our methodology .        the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges the generous support of a number of agencies and institutes that have supported the _ fermi _ lat collaboration .",
