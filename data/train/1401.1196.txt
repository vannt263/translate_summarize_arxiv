    "graphene  a single atom thick honeycomb lattice of carbon - is a unique material combining the superb mechanical , electronic , optical and thermal properties.@xcite nevertheless , ever since the first experimental isolation of graphene in 2004,@xcite there has been a growing interest in  enhancement \" of graphene by means of chemical functionalization.@xcite this is especially promising since unlike three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials where chemical functionalization typically affects only surface properties , graphene is affected and modified in its entirety because of its truly 2d `` all - surface '' nature .",
    "for instance , chemically functionalized graphene ( e.g. , graphene oxide , reduced graphene oxide , graphane ) can have electronic properties very different from those of pristine graphene , which holds promise in nanoelectronics and optics,@xcite nonvolatile memory,@xcite graphene - based nanoassemblies for catalysis , photovoltaics and fuel cells applications.@xcite    the reliability of a functionalized graphene layer within a device is directly linked to the stability of its chemical functionalization against various external stimuli such as temperature , light , as well as thermal and electric currents . for example , functional groups can desorb from the graphene surface or participate in various on - surface chemical transformations causing the deterioration of the device characteristics with time.@xcite furthermore , even if functional groups remain chemically intact and do not desorb , characteristics of a graphene - based device can still change with time provided functional groups can _ move _ along the surface .",
    "for example , this motion can break the ordering of functional groups , thus strongly affecting the electronic structure of graphene ( e.g. , bandgap).@xcite    motion of functional groups along the surface of graphene occurs either via diffusion@xcite or via drift when , e.g. , an electric current is present.@xcite the latter phenomenon - electromigration - originates from scattering of in - graphene charge carriers by a functional group .",
    "the force resulting from the scattering - mediated momentum transfer is universally referred to as the _ electron wind force_.@xcite we have recently demonstrated theoretically a surprising efficiency of electromigration of bivalent functional groups on graphene.@xcite therefore , on one hand , thorough understanding of this phenomenon is critical in order to assess the rate of aging of functionalized graphene within current - carrying devices . on the other hand ,",
    "the electromigration can be exploited as an efficient and easily controllable means to drive the mass transport along the surface of graphene .",
    "this can be of use in nano - assembly@xcite and drug delivery applications.@xcite    in this paper , we develop an accurate model for electromigration of bivalent adsorbates on graphene , focusing on epoxy ( @xmath0 ) and amino ( @xmath1 ) groups .",
    "we significantly expand on results of our previous work@xcite by ( i ) systematically analyzing various equilibrium and non - equilibrium contributions to the interaction between these functional groups and graphene , ( ii ) evaluating the driving force of electromigration  to all orders \" , ( iii ) investigating the graphene crystal lattice effects on electromigration , and ( iv ) performing accurate electronic structure theory calculations to carefully parameterize the developed model .",

    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "this section is devoted to the detailed description of the electron wind force that pushes functional groups along a substrate ( graphene ) in a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "specifically , in this work we go beyond a simple jellium model derivation of ref .   and take the substrate lattice into account . due to the presence of this lattice , the force acting on a functional group can be non - zero at different positions with respect to the lattice sites even when no current is flowing through the system . because of this , a separation of conservative and non - conservative ( wind force ) components of the total force becomes non - trivial .",
    "it will be shown shortly that this separation becomes unambiguous when the force is _ averaged _ over trajectories connecting two equivalent crystallographic points .",
    "this allows us to introduce an effective local electron wind force .",
    "the derivations to follow are sufficiently general and applicable to not just specific bivalent functional groups that are of interest in this work , but also to generic _ adsorbates _ on graphene . thus the term  adsorbate \" and  functional group \" will be used interchangeably below .",
    "interaction of an adsorbate with a substrate ( e.g. , graphene ) results in a microscopic force acting on the adsorbate .",
    "we denote an effective electrostatic potential of the adsorbate by @xmath9 so that the hamiltonian term encoding the interaction of the adsorbate with the substrate is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the operator of spatially - resolved charge density of the substrate .",
    "the position of the adsorbate is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on a non - magnetic case and suppress spin degrees of freedom unless stated otherwise .",
    "further , we assume the adsorbate to be _ structureless _ ,",
    "i.e. , it is represented by a local single - particle potential , @xmath13 , with no frequency dependence .",
    "we emphasize here that @xmath11 is the total charge density of the substrate in a sense that it incorporates both electrons and nuclei of the substrate .",
    "once the adsorbate - substrate interaction is defined in the operator form , the force acting on the adsorbate from the substrate in the adiabatic regime can be calculated as @xcite @xmath14\\rho({\\bf x}),\\label{eq : total_force}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the quantum - mechanical average of @xmath16 over the exact state of the adsorbate - substrate system .",
    "this averaging over the exact state of the entire system naturally accounts for the effects of the adsorbate - substrate interaction `` to all orders '' , and not just perturbatively .",
    "furthermore , the state of the system can be a non - equilibrium one , e.g. , with dc electric current flowing through the substrate .    in the thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "( [ eq : total_force ] ) is just a representation of the hellmann - feynman theorem , which relates the force to the variation of the total energy of the system.@xcite the derivation is more involved in the non - equilibrium case .",
    "however , the result of this derivation remains formally the same as in the equilibrium case , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_force ] ) still holds true.@xcite    in this work , a non - equilibrium electronic state of the substrate before the attachment of the adsorbate is specified through the populations of single - electron states @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac population of state @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the deviation of the population of this state from the equilibrium one .",

    "accordingly , it is convenient to use more explicit subscripts :  @xmath28 \" for @xmath29 and  @xmath30 \" for @xmath31 .",
    "we first consider all the equilibrium expansion terms , i.e. , those with @xmath32 .",
    "these terms sum up into the equilibrium contribution to the force acting on the adsorbate @xmath33\\rho_{eq}({\\bf x}),\\label{eq : force_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium adsorbate - substrate interaction potential can be introduced as @xmath35 so that @xmath36 is _",
    "conservative_. the local energy minima of the potential energy landscape , generated by @xmath37 , determine the equilibrium configurations of the adsorbate - substrate system .",
    "saddle points of this landscape define transition states of hopping diffusion of adsorbates along the substrate . in sec .",

    "therefore , this contribution is conservative and can be considered as a non - equilibrium correction to the equilibrium adsorbate - substrate interaction potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_inter ] ) .",
    "the second non - equilibrium term considered , i.e. , @xmath39 , can be understood using the following auxiliary considerations .",
    "the linear response of the substrate charge density to the adsorbate potential in a general non - equilibrium situation can be written as @xmath45 where the non - equilibrium kubo response function of the substrate to the static external perturbation is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "( [ eq : rho_linear ] ) is equivalent to the first - order born approximation in the scattering theory.@xcite    expanding response function @xmath46 into powers of @xmath27 up to linear terms , one obtains @xmath47 where the last r.h.s .",
    "term is linear with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the contribution of the first r.h.s .",
    "term of this expression to the adsorbate - substrate force has been already accounted for within @xmath48 ( as @xmath49 ) .",
    "then , @xmath50 determines @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath27 is non - negligible only around the fermi surface . at this condition",
    ", it is natural to assume that @xmath50 is mostly defined by the electrons near the fermi surface of graphene , i.e. , @xmath51 , where the non - equilibrium contribution to the electronic response function of the substrate is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "the non - equilibrium electronic response function , @xmath53 , can in general be non - symmetric with respect to the permutation @xmath54 and , therefore , can be written as a sum of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts as @xmath55 where @xmath56/2 $ ] and the @xmath57 superscript stands for the parity with respect to the coordinate permutation .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the symmetric contribution to @xmath39 , given by @xmath58\\delta\\chi_{e}^{+}({\\bf x},{\\bf x}')u_{{\\bf r}}({\\bf x}'),\\label{eq : force_11_symm}\\ ] ] forms an exact differential , and , therefore , is conservative .",

    "( [ eq : force_eq ] ) , ( [ eq : force_01 ] ) , ( [ eq : force_11_symm ] ) and ( [ eq : force_11_asymm ] ) , and neglecting higher order non - equilibrium terms one obtains @xmath61 the curly brackets with the subscript @xmath62 emphasize the conservative nature of the terms within .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tforce ] ) is a non - conservative force driving the electromigration : the electron wind force .",
    "let us consider a situation where an adsorbate is hopping along a certain trajectory between two crystallographically equivalent points of the substrate lattice .",
    "these points are specified by the initial and final positions of the adsorbate , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the average force acting on the adsorbate along this hopping trajectory is then given by @xmath65 where the integral is evaluated along the hopping trajectory and the microscopic force , @xmath66 , is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tforce ] ) .",
    "the length of the trajectory is denoted by @xmath67 . the sum of conservative terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tforce ] ) can be considered as a gradient of a certain scalar potential , @xmath68 .",
    "this potential has the same translational symmetry as the substrate lattice resulting in @xmath69 .",
    "then , the contribution of conservative terms into the averaged force is zero so eq .  ( [ eq : fw_org ] ) reduces to @xmath70 this force breaks the equivalence of @xmath63 and @xmath64 points within the substrate lattice , and ,",
    "therefore , can drive the directed hopping , i.e. , migration , of adsorbates along the substrate . from what follows",
    "it will become clear why this force can be called _ electron wind force _ ( hence , the subscript @xmath71 - wind ) .",
    "for now , we just emphasize that the rigorous definition of the electron wind force can only be done through averaging of the position - dependent force over the hopping trajectory connecting two crystallographically equivalent points .",
    "however , it is still possible ( although ambiguous ) to introduce an effective _ local _ wind force , @xmath72 , by choosing any vector field that produces the correct averaging over hopping trajectories . in our case",
    "an obvious choice is @xmath73 - the choice we will assume henceforth .    in what follows , we will neglect the conservative non - equilibrium corrections to the equilibrium force , @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we will show later that the higher order ( with respect to @xmath42 ) corrections to the wind force are small compared to the leading one , @xmath73 , for the specific system considered in this work ( covalently bound adsorbates on graphene ) .",
    "these two assumptions transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : tforce ] ) into @xmath74 here , the first term determines the potential energy landscape where the diffusion of the adsorbate occurs .",
    "the second term , @xmath75 , breaks the translational invariance of the lattice , thus pushing adsorbates along the substrate .",
    "the electronic response function is given by@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the magnitude of the electron charge and @xmath78 is the transition density .",
    "the normalized bloch wave of electronic state @xmath19 is defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bloch ( or cellular ) function periodic over a unit cell .",

    "the energy of single - electron state @xmath19 is given by @xmath84 , and therefore , the energy difference between states @xmath19 and @xmath85 is @xmath86 .",
    "the explicit dependence of the response function @xmath53 on @xmath87 and @xmath88 and not just on @xmath89 comes from the local - field effects due to perturbation of the charge density on the scale of a single unit cell.@xcite using the sokhotskiplemelj identity , @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 stands for the cauchy principal value ) , the antisymmetric part of the response function can be written as @xmath92/2\\nonumber\\\\ & = -i\\frac{\\pi e^2}{\\hbar}\\sum_{i , j}\\left[\\delta f_{i}-\\delta f_{j}\\right]\\eta_{ij}({\\bf x})\\eta_{ji}({\\bf x}')\\delta(\\omega_{ij}).\\label{eq : chi_asymm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] despite the imaginary unit in front , this expression is easily shown to be real . since a bloch function , @xmath93 , is periodic over a unit cell , its expansion into the discrete fourier series yields @xmath94 where the bloch function overlap coefficients are given by @xmath95 here , the integral is evaluated over the area of a single unit cell , @xmath96 , and vector @xmath97 runs through all possible translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice of the substrate . combining this expression with eqs .",

    "hence the name _ electron wind force_. the two factors to the right of the first summation symbol , i.e. , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , guarantee that the scattering is _ elastic _ ( i.e. , it conserves energy ) and occurs only in the close proximity of the fermi surface , respectively .",
    "below we briefly discuss a few scenarios of how eq .",
    "( [ eq : fw_general ] ) can be used in various practical situations .    in the case of a free electron gas ( i.e. , jellium model )",
    "bloch function @xmath80 reduces to a constant , resulting in @xmath103 .",
    "this yields @xmath104\\left({\\bf k}_{i}-{\\bf k}_{j}\\right)\\left|u_{{\\bf r}}({\\bf k}_{i}-{\\bf k}_{j})\\right|^{2}\\delta(\\omega_{ij}),\\label{eq : wind_free}\\ ] ] which is essentially a fermi golden rule expression for the electron wind , where the rate of scattering , @xmath105 , is weighted with the density of available final and initial states , @xmath102 , and the momentum transfer , @xmath106 .",
    "it has to be emphasized here that @xmath82 becomes the true momentum here , and not just a quasimomentum .",
    "an example where the difference between momentum and quasimomentum is emphasized can be constructed as follows .",
    "we still consider free electrons , but unlike the previous example , we introduce a fictitious periodic lattice ( lattice constant @xmath107 ) with an infinitesimal periodic potential . if the unit cell is large compared to the inverse fermi momentum of free electrons ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) , then a quasimomentum of an electronic state near the fermi surface , taken in the first brillouin zone , is much smaller in magnitude than the actual momentum of the state .",
    "this is because a quasimomentum in the first brillouin zone can not exceed @xmath109 .",
    "however , since the problem still concerns free electrons ( albeit in a different representation ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fw_general ] ) should still yield momentum transfer prefactors , @xmath100 , with the magnitude equal to the true fermi momentum of free electrons .",
    "this is realized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fw_general ] ) by appearance of non - vanishing contributions with @xmath110 .",
    "specifically , a rapidly oscillating free - electron wavefunction with momentum @xmath111 , being treated as a bloch wave in the lattice with the lattice constant @xmath112 , is represented as @xmath113 in the first brillouin zone of the fictitious lattice , where @xmath114 , and @xmath97 is chosen so that @xmath115 .",
    "the second r.h.s .",
    "factor in the wavefunction representation is thus a rapidly oscillating bloch function ( @xmath116 ) , which , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_exp ] ) , yields a momentum transfer prefactor of a required magnitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fw_general ] ) .",
    "another example concerns an adsorbate - substrate system where the actual substrate lattice ( i.e. , with an underlying periodic potential ) is present with the characteristic lattice constant of @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that the following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the scattering potential is smooth over the unit cell , i.e. , @xmath117 , and ( ii ) the quisimomenta of electron states belonging to the fermi surface is much less in magnitude than @xmath118 ( i.e. , the fermi surface is small and centered around the @xmath119-point ) .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : fw_general ] ) reduces to @xmath120\\left({\\bf k}_{i}-{\\bf k}_{j}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\left|u_{{\\bf r}}({\\bf k}_{i}-{\\bf k}_{j})b_{ij}\\right|^{2}\\delta(\\omega_{ij}),\\label{eq : fw_general-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 this expression for the wind force is very similar to the one for free electrons , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wind_free ] ) , except that the scattering amplitude now depends not only on the fourier transform of the adsorbate potential , @xmath122 , but also on the expansion coefficients of bloch functions at @xmath119-point , @xmath123 .",
    "thus , if the two conditions specified above are satisfied , then momentum transfer can be equated with the change in quasimomentum with the only difference from the free electron picture being the renormalization of the scattering potential by the band structure effects via @xmath123 .",
    "the last important scenario concerns essentially the previous example with the only modification that the fermi surface is centered not around the @xmath119-point , but around some other high - symmetry point located at the edge of the first brillouin zone .",
    "then , of course , eq .  ( [ eq : fw_general ] ) still applies , but",
    "significant fraction of scattering events would result in the umklapp scattering , i.e. , @xmath106 falls off the first brillouin zone , but , e.g. , @xmath100 is small compared to @xmath118 .",
    "however , instead of applying the general formalism , one can use a more physically transparent approach . specifically , we recall that the reciprocal lattice is periodic in a sense that quasimomentum @xmath124 ( @xmath97 being an arbitrary translational vector of the reciprocal lattice ) is physically equivalent to @xmath82 .",
    "the standard convention is to center the first brillouin zone around the @xmath119-point , but this is not the only possibility . in principle , on can center the first brillouin zone around an arbitrary point of the reciprocal lattice and then measure a quasimomentum relative to that point .",
    "this `` translation '' of the brillouin zone is often used when the @xmath125 approach is applied to describe an electronic structure of various materials with translational symmetry , e.g. , lead salts ( pbse , pbs)@xcite or graphene.@xcite the only pitfall of this approach is that bloch functions are not periodic on the lattice anymore , since they have to absorb the momentum change between the new center of the brillouin zone and the @xmath119-point .",
