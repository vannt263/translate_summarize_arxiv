    "there are reasons why low - energy ( @xmath2 20 mev ) nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) scattering data might appear to be of limited use in constraining @xmath3 phase - shift analyses ( psas ) @xcite and potential models ( pms ) @xcite .",
    "for one thing , the deuteron bound - state properties already provide a fairly stringent constraint for any @xmath3 pm , and might seem sufficient . for another , low - energy scattering data can provide constraints only for the lower partial wave @xmath3 interactions and , even then , can not determine individual partial waves .",
    "for example , the low - energy analyzing power , @xmath0 , is governed by the three angular momentum @xmath4 = 1 interactions , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "although @xmath3 data provide constraints on the @xmath8 phase shifts taken together , it can not determine each parameter unambiguously @xcite .    despite the very small magnitude of @xmath3 @xmath0 , its importance derives from the fact that it is possible experimentally to measure such data to great precision . as a result",
    ", @xmath3 @xmath0 can provide a crucial test of our understanding of the @xmath3 interaction and of the nuclear force in general .",
    "perhaps the most important controversy surrounding current @xmath3 interaction models concerns the pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , machleidt and slaus point out that low - energy proton - proton ( @xmath10-@xmath10 ) @xmath0 data are very sensitive to the neutral pion - nucleon coupling constant , implying a value of @xmath11 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the correct description of the quadrupole moment of the deuteron and low - energy neutron - proton ( @xmath12-@xmath10 ) @xmath0 data requires meson - exchange based @xmath3 potential models to have values for the neutral and charged pion - nucleon coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , of 14.0 or larger .",
    "the latter finding is clearly inconsistent with the results of the nijmegen group s ni93 psa ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite ) and of the vpi group ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 from @xmath3 scattering @xcite and @xmath19 from @xmath20 scattering @xcite ) .    in principle , this inconsistency can be reduced by assuming a charge - splitting of the pion - nucleon coupling constant , _",
    "i.e. _ , one could assume that the neutral pion couples to the nucleon with a different strength than the charged pion . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the combination of @xmath21 and @xmath22 creates a sufficiently large value for the quadrupole moment of the deuteron , and reproduces the low - energy @xmath10-@xmath10 @xmath23 phase shifts .    at the same time that the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite were performed , there were indications that @xmath12-@xmath10 differential cross - section data at intermediate energies favored a larger value for @xmath24 . on this , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive overview of recent determinations of @xmath9 and especially ref .",
    "@xcite , which quotes @xmath25 obtained from @xmath12-@xmath10 differential cross section data at @xmath1 = 162 mev .",
    "however , the recent @xmath12-@xmath10 differential cross section data obtained at iucf at 194 mev @xcite do not support this larger value of @xmath24 .",
    "although it seems likely that there is no significant charge splitting in the pion - nucleon coupling constants at intermediate energies , the question remains unresolved at low energies . on the one hand ,",
    "the theoretical models used to account for the charge dependence of the singlet @xmath3 scattering lengths , @xmath26 , do not allow for any large charge splitting of @xmath9 . on the other hand , many low - energy data suggest a significant charge splitting .",
    "we report here on the results of a new @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 experiment carried out at @xmath1 = 12.0 mev utilizing improved data - taking and data - analysis techniques . for references to previous @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath27 measurements see refs .  @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the inconsistencies between low - energy analyzing power and available theoretical models of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] . polarized neutrons with mean",
    "energy of 12.0 mev and total energy spread of about 400 kev were produced via the polarization - transfer reaction @xmath28h(@xmath29,@xmath30)@xmath31he at @xmath32 .",
    "the polarized deuteron beam was accelerated to @xmath33 = 9.40 mev and entered through a 4.6 @xmath34 m havar foil into a small ( 3.14 cm long , 0.48 cm radius ) gas cell filled with 7.8 atm of deuterium gas and capped with a 0.1 cm thick gold beamstop .",
    "the gas cell was mounted inside a 1.8 m - thick wall made of concrete , paraffin , iron , copper , and lead , to shield the neutron detectors from the direct flux of the neutron source .",
    "typical deuteron beam intensities on target were 1.5 @xmath34a and typical values for the deuteron vector polarization @xmath35 were 0.65 .",
    "the polarized neutrons produced at @xmath32 relative to the incident deuteron beam passed through a collimation system to produce a rectangular shaped neutron beam at the position of the proton - containing active target labelled `` center detector '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . the center detector ( cd ) consisted of an upright cylinder made of the plastic scintillator material ne102a with dimensions 1.9 cm diameter and 3.8 cm height .",
    "the cd was located at a distance of 172 cm from the neutron source and was mounted via a short light guide onto a 5 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "neutrons scattered to the left or right were detected by five pairs of neutron detectors positioned symmetrically relative to the incident neutron beam direction in the horizontal scattering plane .",
    "the neutron detectors ( nds ) were filled with the liquid scintillator material ne213 .",
    "these detectors had excellent neutron - gamma pulse - shape discrimination capabilities and had an active volume of 4.3 cm wide , 11.9 cm high and 7.5 cm deep .",
    "they were viewed by 5 cm diameter pmts through 0.5 cm thick pyrex glass windows and 7.5 cm long light guides .",
    "the neutron detectors were mounted onto ( low - mass ) 30 cm high stands and placed on an aluminum ring surrounding the cd .",
    "the center - to - center distance between the cd and the neutron detectors ranged from 45 cm to 70 cm depending on scattering angle .",
    "the angular separation between the neutron detectors was @xmath36 ( lab ) . in order to cover the angular range from @xmath37 to 72@xmath38 in 4@xmath38 steps ,",
    "three settings of the five detector pairs were required .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the neutron polarization was measured with a neutron polarimeter located downstream of the @xmath12-@xmath10 scattering arrangement .",
    "the polarimeter consisted of a @xmath39he gas scintillator pressurized to 100 atm ( 95% he , 5% xe ) and a pair of neutron detectors positioned at @xmath40 , which were identical to those used for @xmath12-@xmath10 scattering . in order to reduce instrumental asymmetries for the @xmath12-@xmath10 and @xmath12-@xmath39he measurements , the deuteron vector polarization @xmath41 , and therefore the neutron polarization ,",
    "was flipped at a frequency of 10 hz ( between up and down relative to the horizontal scattering plane ) .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath10 and @xmath12-@xmath39he data were accumulated simultaneously in six runs , each lasting about 250 data - taking hours .",
    "the data - acquisition electronics recorded the center detector pulse height ( cdph ) , the neutron time of flight ( ntof ) between the cd and the nds , and spectra for each nd , including pulse - shape information . since the energy of the scattered neutrons varied from @xmath42 = 11.1 mev at @xmath37 to @xmath42 = 1.1 mev at @xmath43 , different hardware thresholds were used for the nds .",
    "in addition , three different gains were used for the cd signals ( using different dynodes ) .",
    "software cuts were set on the cdph and the pulse height in the nds to eliminate pulses at the extreme ends of the spectra .",
    "gates were also set on the neutrons in the pulse - shape discrimination spectra and wide gates were set on the elastic peak of the ntof spectrum .",
    "all four of these cuts ( identical for spin - up and spin - down spectra ) were used to generate two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectra of cdph versus ntof , for scattering to the left and right nds and for neutron spin up and spin down .",
    "an example of such a spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] where the cdph scale has been temporarily compressed in order to fit within 64 channels .",
    "tight ntof gates were set in these 2d spectra eliminating the tails of the peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] , in order to identify the elastic scattering events of interest ( again , identical for spin - up and spin - down spectra ) .",
    "these new ntof gates were used to sort the final cdph spectra ( now in their full 512-channel resolution ) corresponding to each neutron detector and spin state .",
    "the cdph spectra were used to determine the @xmath12-@xmath10 yields and scattering asymmetries , after applying the corrections described in the following section .",
    "the above process was also followed to sample the accidental ( _ i.e. , _ time uncorrelated ) background by using an ntof cut located at times shorter than the gamma peak .",
    "the accidental background proved to be extremely small .",
    "after the sorting procedure described above and the subtraction of the accidental events , the data still contained a number of finite - geometry and multiple - scattering effects . to remove these effects , monte - carlo calculations were performed to simulate the experiment .",
    "two effects are due exclusively to the finite size of the center detector ( cd ) and the neutron detectors ( nds ) and have a slight effect on single - scattering events .",
    "first , because there is a range of angles subtended by each detector set at each nominal angle and because the cross section of @xmath12-@xmath10 elastic scattering varies over this range , we must report an effective angle .",
    "these were calculated by our code and are listed in the first column of table [ tab : ay ] .",
    "this effect is small ; the largest shift is no more than a half of a degree .",
    "the second finite - geometry effect concerns the value of @xmath44 itself , again due to the range of angles subtended by each nd .",
    "effective @xmath44 values were calculated by our monte - carlo code and these were compared to the values from the code s library .",
    "the ratio between these two values was then applied to the data . once again , the correction is small ; only the first four angles had corrections that were larger than the uncertainty of the calculation ( about 0.00012 ) .",
    "in addition to elastic scattering , multiple scattering events occur in the cd .",
    "about 50% ( depending on nd angle ) of these events were eliminated as a result of the neutron time of flight ( ntof ) gate .",
    "nevertheless , the center detector pulse height ( cdph ) spectrum contained multiple scattering events amounting to approximately 2% of all single scattering events .",
    "our monte - carlo simulation showed that the only significant processes were those due to double scattering , specifically neutron double scattering from hydrogen ( @xmath45h-@xmath45h ) , neutron scattering from hydrogen and subsequent scattering from carbon ( @xmath45h-@xmath46c ) , and neutron scattering from carbon and subsequent scattering from hydrogen ( @xmath46c-@xmath45h ) . in performing these calculations , we used complete libraries of cross - section and polarization data for both @xmath12-@xmath45h and @xmath12-@xmath46c scattering .",
    "we will return to the subject of the @xmath12-@xmath46c library in our discussion of the pde correction .",
    "we also removed edge - effect events from the data , which result when recoil protons leave the cd before depositing their full energy .",
    "along with the double scattering events , these counts elongate the tails of the cdph peak , especially to the left ( low - energy ) side .",
    "a sample cdph spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the solid curve represents our monte - carlo simulation for a scattering angle of @xmath47 , while the small open circles show the experimental data .",
    "a greatly expanded view is shown in the middle panel , where the open circles again indicate the experimental data .",
    "the curves labeled `` double '' are the calculated double scattering contributions @xmath48h-@xmath48h , @xmath48h-@xmath46c , and @xmath46c-@xmath48h .",
    "the dotted curve labled `` edge '' is the calculated pulse - height distribution due to edge effects .",
    "finally , the curve labeled `` single '' is the calculated single scattering contribution ( plus the edge effects ) .",
    "all of the calculations are normalized to the data .",
    "another expanded view is displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] .",
    "here , `` data with subtraction '' shows the data after the removal of all counts due to double scattering and edge effects ( labeled `` ms+edge '' ) . even after this subtraction , a small background remains , amounting to about 0.3% of the single - scattering events .",
    "a number of fits were used to estimate this remaining background , ranging from a linear fit between channel numbers 150 and 350 to a parabolic fit between channel numbers 180 and 280 . due to the smallness of the remaining background , the asymmetry proved to be independent of our background choice , within statistical uncertainties .",
    "we also concluded that the background was unpolarized .",
    "for all nd angle settings we approximated the remaining background by a linear function connecting the left and right sides of the cdph peak ( for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] from channel 180 to 280 ) . the remaining background seen above channel 290 in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] is due to cross - talk effects between two adjacent detectors , specifically neutron scattering from the detector positioned at a larger scattering angle ( and shorter distance from the cd ) to the detector of interest .",
    "three sets of gates were used to calculate the yields and asymmetries , at 10% ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] by the dashed lines ) , 30% , and 50% of the cdph peak maximum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prph ] , this is done for @xmath49 , for spin up scattering to the left nd at @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the yields @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 were obtained to calculate the asymmetry @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the nominal gates were the 30% set .",
    "the other two gates ( the 10% and 50% set ) were used to check on the appropriateness of the background subtraction . within statistical uncertainty ,",
    "the results for @xmath55 proved to be independent of the choice of the gate width .    in order to extract the @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 from the measured asymmetry @xmath56",
    ", the neutron polarization @xmath57 must be known . for this purpose",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath39he asymmetry data acquired with the neutron polarimeter referred to above were processed and analyzed in the same way as the @xmath12-@xmath10 asymmetry data . in this case",
    "the @xmath39he recoil pulse height in the high - pressure gas scintillator plays the role of the cdph in the plastic scintillator used for the @xmath12-@xmath10 asymmetry measurements .",
    "the neutron polarization was obtained from @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is defined as above . here ,",
    "the effective analyzing power @xmath60 for @xmath12-@xmath39he scattering at @xmath1 = 12.0 mev was calculated for the present neutron polarimeter geometry via monte - carlo calculations .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath39he phase shifts of stammbach and walter @xcite were used .",
    "all of the relevant multiple scattering processes were included .",
    "we obtained @xmath61 , where the uncertainty is mainly of a systematic nature reflecting the uncertainty associated with the @xmath12-@xmath39he phase shifts .",
    "the average neutron polarization was @xmath62 .",
    "at such a high level of precision , a subtle systematic effect comes into play , which does not cancel by reversal of the neutron polarization .",
    "this is the polarization dependent efficiency ( pde ) @xcite of the neutron detectors .",
    "the nds contain hydrogen and carbon in the ratio of 1.21:1 .",
    "the double scattering process @xmath46c-@xmath45h in the nds , which accounts for about 10% of the total neutron detection efficiency , is sensitive to the @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 .",
    "if the @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 is not constant over the range of neutron energies @xmath42 seen by a particular nd , an instrumental asymmetry will occur .",
    "typical values for @xmath63 are 800 kev .",
    "a realistic correction for this effect requires a detailed knowledge of the @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 , especially in the resonance region of the @xmath12-@xmath46c total cross section between 2.0 and 8.5 mev neutron energy . in this energy regime the @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 changes rapidly and therefore causes sizeable pde effects .",
    "all of the post-1985 @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 measurements have been corrected for the pde . however , due to the lack of a detailed @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 database , especially at low energies , the accuracy of the associated corrections was limited . in assembling our data library",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the energy range from 2.2 to 8.5 mev . from @xmath64",
    "0 to 6.5 mev , we used an r - matrix analysis by hale @xcite , which included the data from ref .  @xcite . in certain regions ( especially for forward angles and for neutron energies between 3.5 and 4.5 mev ) , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite missed the @xmath0 data slightly and we therefore substituted legendre polynomial fits to the data of ref .",

    "8.5 mev , we used the chen - tornow psa exclusively . the new data by roper _ et al .",
    "_  and the analyses of hale , chen and tornow improved the @xmath12-@xmath46c @xmath0 database considerably , making corrections for the pde more reliable .",
    "we ran our monte - carlo code for 20 separate legs , each leg of three million events , and each leg starting from a different random number .",
    "the pde correction to the @xmath0 data was taken as the difference between the @xmath0 result with polarization effects turned on in the nds and the result with the polarization turned off .",
    "the second column of table [ tab : ay ] lists our final pde corrections .",
    "note that they vary greatly from one data point to the other due to the pronounced resonance features in @xmath12-@xmath46c scattering at low energy .",
    "it is important also to note that our present results agree well with the overall trend of the pde corrections of ref .",
    "@xcite , which used a different monte - carlo code and a different database .",
    "our reason for having much greater confidence in the present pde results is due to our extensive and detailed work in revising the data libraries , as outlined above .",
    "the third column in table [ tab : ay ] summarizes our final results for @xmath0 in @xmath12-@xmath10 scattering at @xmath1 = 12.0 mev .",
    "note the small overall uncertainty .",
    "the final results include uncertainties in @xmath0 due to statistics , the measurement of beam polarization , the multiple - scattering calculation , the pde calculation , and the remaining background ( typically zero ) all added in quadrature .",
    "the final uncertainties are about half of those of the previous tunl @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 measurement at @xmath1 = 12.0 mev @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the atomic beam polarized ion source used in the present study produced about four times the deuteron current as the lamb - shift source used in the previous study .",
    "figure [ fig : data ] shows the present @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 in comparison to the @xmath3 phase - shift analysis prediction ( solid curve ) of the nijmegen group , ni93 .",
    "clearly , ni93 provides a larger @xmath0 throughout the entire angular distribution .",
    "the accuracy of the neutron polarization determined in the present work does not allow for a renormalization of the @xmath0 data beyond the error bars given in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "furthermore , the present @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 data are in good agreement with the trend established by previous tunl data where a different method was used for determining @xmath57 @xcite .    as we have pointed out in the introduction , the underlying @xmath3 dynamics that characterize @xmath0 precludes us from extracting unambiguous information about the @xmath65 @xmath3 interactions .",
    "however , we can conclude that the ni93 @xmath3 psa overestimates the @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 at @xmath1 = 12.0 mev .",
    "this statement is of considerable importance considering the fact that most @xmath3 potential model builders use the ni93 psa results or the associated database for determining the free parameters of their models .",
    "one has to conclude that all the recent so - called high - precision @xmath3 potential models overestimate the @xmath12-@xmath10 @xmath0 at low energies .",
    "this observation has far - reaching consequences for nuclear scattering systems with @xmath66 , which are much more sensitive to the @xmath65 @xmath3 interactions than the @xmath3 system @xcite .",
