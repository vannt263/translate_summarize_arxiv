    "darboux transformations are a well known tool in the theory of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the classical darboux transformation @xcite deals with a sturm  liouville problem ( the one dimensional stationary schrdinger equation ) generating , at the same time , new potentials and new wave functions from given ones thus providing solutions to the korteweg  de vries hierarchy of @xmath0 dimensional integrable systems . however , as it is clearly stated in @xcite , it was an earlier work of moutard @xcite which inspired darboux . in that work one can find the proper transformation that applies to @xmath1 dimensional integrable systems .",
    "note that the initial area of applications of the darboux transformations , which preceded the theory of integrable systems , was the theory of conjugate and asymptotic nets where the large body of results on darboux transformations was formulated @xcite .",
    "most of the techniques that allow us to find solutions of integrable non - linear differential equations have been successfully applied to difference equations .",
    "these include mutually interrelated methods such as bilinearization method @xcite and the sato approach @xcite , direct linearization method @xcite , inverse scattering method @xcite , the nonlocal @xmath2 dressing method @xcite , the algebro - geometric techniques @xcite .",
    "also the method of the darboux transformation has been successfully applied to the discrete integrable systems .",
    "the present paper aims to review application of the darboux transformation technique for the equations that can be regarded as discretizations of second order linear differential equations in two dimensions , their distinguished subclasses and systems of such equations .    while presenting the results we are trying to keep the relation with continuous case .",
    "however , we are aware of weak points of this way of exposition .",
    "the theory of discrete integrable systems @xcite is reacher but also , in a sense , simpler then the corresponding theory of integrable partial differential equations . in the course of a limiting procedure , which gives differential systems from the discrete ones , various symmetries and relations between different discrete systems",
    "the classical example is provided ( see , for example @xcite ) by the hierarchy of the kadomsev ",
    "petviashvilii ( kp ) equations , which can be obtained from a single hirota ",
    "miwa equation  the opposite way , from differential to discrete , involves all equations of the hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ dodane ]",
    "we expose main ideas in the theory of darboux transformations in multidimension . in section [ sec:6p ]",
    "we present the construction of the darboux transformation for the discrete second order linear problem  the 6-point scheme  which can be considered as a discretization of the general second order linear partial differential equation in two variables .",
    "then we discuss various specifications and reductions of the 6-point scheme .",
    "we separately present in section [ sec : s - a ] the darboux transformations for discrete self - adjoint two dimensional linear systems on the square , triangular and the honeycomb lattices , and their relation to the discrete moutard transformation .",
    "section [ sec:4p ] is devoted to detailed presentation of the darboux transformations for systems of the 4-point linear problems , their various specifications and the corresponding permutability theorems .",
    "sec:4p - red ] is dedicated to reductions of the fundamental transformation compatible with additional restrictions on the form of the four point scheme .",
    "finally , in section [ 3p - sch ] we review the darboux transformations for the 3-point linear problem , and the corresponding celebrated hirota s discrete kp nonlinear system .",
    "the main idea included in the paper has its origin in jonas paper @xcite where fundamental transformation for conjugate nets has been presented . neglecting the geometrical context of jonas paper we only would like to say that the fundamental transformation acts on solutions of compatible system of second order linear differential equations on function @xmath3 @xmath4 where coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 , and for @xmath8 they have to obey a nonlinear differential equation ( compatibility conditions ) ; we use notation that subscript preceded by coma denotes partial differentiation with respect to indicated variables .",
    "every fundamental transformation @xmath9 can be presented as composition of suitably chosen    1 .",
    "radial transformation @xmath10 @xmath11 2 .",
    "combescure transformation @xmath12 @xmath13 3 .",
    "radial transformation @xmath14 @xmath15    we refer interested reader to eisenhart book @xcite for further details .",
    "as the practice shows the fundamental transformation is indeed fundamental - in the sense that most ( if not all ) of the darboux transformations are reductions of the fundamental transformation .    here",
    "we follow this basic idea discovered almost one hundred years ago .",
    "we start from presenting two dimensional difference operators @xmath16 ( and corresponding difference equations @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is function of discrete variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) together with the transformation @xmath21 which is composition of    1 .",

    "the darboux transformation can be viewed as transformation acting on equivalence classes ( with respect to gauge ) of equation ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "therefore one can confine himself to particular elements of equivalence class .",
    "commonly used choice is to confine oneself to the affine gauge i.e. to equations that obeys @xmath100 if one puts s = const in ( this condition is not necessary ) then the above constraint is preserved under the darboux transformation .",
    "one can consider further specification of the gauge @xmath101 this choice of gauge we would like to refer as to basic gauge of equation .",
    "note that if the equation is in a basic gauge its formal adjoint is in a basic gauge too .      in the continuous case due to possibility of changing independent variables one can reduce , provided equation",

    "we can notice that coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath103 transform in a very simple manner .",
    "in particular , if any of these coefficients equals zero then its transform equals zero too .",
