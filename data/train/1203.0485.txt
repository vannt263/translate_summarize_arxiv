    "the concept of entropy was introduced over 150 years ago to provide a measure of the evident irreversibility of macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena .",
    "the conflict between its monotonic increase and the underlying time reversal symmetry of the microscopic dynamics , first pointed out by loschmidt , is but one of its apparent mysteries .",
    "nevertheless , in recent years significant insights into the nature of irreversibility and entropy production have emerged , partly due to the need for a framework to interpret thermodynamic processes on the nanoscale .",
    "these developments had their beginnings in the dissipation function and fluctuation theorem in deterministic thermostatted systems considered by evans et al @xcite , and have continued with similar concepts within the realms of chaos theory @xcite and of stochastic dynamical modelling @xcite .",
    "some powerful results such as the crooks and jarzynski relations stand out @xcite along with a unifying framework for overdamped langevin dynamics @xcite based on a stochastic description of the first law of thermodynamics commonly referred to as stochastic energetics @xcite . in short , entropy production is a measure of the relative likelihoods of forward and reversed behaviour within the context of a model dynamical framework that includes specific dissipative terms .",
    "there are certain differences in viewpoint , but the central insight is that a mechanical ( or maybe dynamical ) quantity can be defined that matches the behaviour of thermodynamic entropy , in particular that on average , it increases with time .",
    "its fluctuating nature provides additional insight into the behaviour of small systems .",
    "+   + more recently , it was proposed that the entropy production associated with non - equilibrium states of small systems , arising from an underlying stochastic model of the dynamics , could be divided into two components , one related to relaxation ( sometimes restricted to transitions between stationary states ) , and the other to any fundamental constraint that maintains the system away from an equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the two components , termed adiabatic and non - adiabatic production rates respectively , were mapped onto earlier concepts known as excess and house - keeping heat transfers @xcite . in a recent development @xcite , however , it was shown that a third component of entropy production could be conceived , arising from the non - equilibrium constraint , but associated with relaxation towards the stationary state .",
    "it only arises when odd dynamical variables play a role in the dynamics , and even then only in specific cases .",
    "only two of the three components of entropy production satisfy an integral fluctuation theorem ( ift ) , making them rigorously positive in the mean , properties shared by the sum of all three ; the third , however , does not satisfy an ift , and in the mean can take either sign .",
    "+   + in this paper , we develop these ideas further , within a framework of full phase space continuous dynamics modelled by stochastic differential equations , with the aim of pinning down the specific form of the three contributions , both in the mean and in fluctuations about the mean and go on to make use of the formalism in some instructive example systems .",
    "we begin by considering the dynamics of a general set of variables @xmath0 that may be odd or even under time reversal by considering the operation @xmath1 where @xmath2 for even and odd variables @xmath3 respectively .",
    "specifically , we consider continuous markovian dynamics described by a system of arbitrary uncorrelated ito stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) such that the evolution of the coordinates @xmath4 are given as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the wiener process .",
    "since we allow @xmath3 to be either odd or even under time reversal we can divide the deterministic dynamics into reversible and irreversible components such that @xmath7 by defining @xmath8 @xmath9 we briefly note that we intend our notation , @xmath10 , to imply a time reversal of all parameters that constitute @xmath11 whether they be dynamical variables included in @xmath4 or not .",
    "for example , a term proportional to a magnetic field appearing in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an even spatial coordinate , would form part of @xmath14 since magnetic fields are odd with respect to time reversal in contrast with , for example , a force , @xmath15 , which would appear in @xmath16 since force is even with respect to time reversal .",
    "+   + we have specified for simplicity that all our sdes are driven by uncorrelated noise such that we have no cross derivatives in the corresponding fokker - planck equation . as such",
    "we may then represent the noise strengths as diffusion coefficients @xmath17 that appear in a fokker - planck equation describing the joint probability density function of the coordinates @xmath18 for simplicity in the later development we assume that the diffusion coefficient is symmetric with respect to time reversal such that @xmath19 , which puts no restriction on the dependence on even coordinates , but requires that @xmath20 is an even function of any odd coordinates . +   + it is helpful to express the fokker - planck equation as a continuity equation in terms of the probability density current @xmath21 @xmath22 which we separate into irreversible and reversible components .",
    "these take vector form @xmath23 as do the drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath26 having set out the dynamics we shall be using , we now consider the general procedure for producing quantities which obey ifts . given an interval of duration @xmath27 ,",

    "as @xmath181 increases , the asymmetry of the stationary state ( in velocity ) decreases and the contribution from @xmath64 diminishes . consequently , the two stationary distributions become increasingly similar , meaning the contribution @xmath60 also diminishes rendering the total entropy production almost entirely comprised of the contribution from @xmath62 . when the full overdamped limit is taken @xmath62 is the only contribution and the results map onto those found in @xcite .",
    "we have derived sdes describing the fluctuating evolution of three contributions to entropy production , along with expressions for their mean behaviour , and demonstrated that two of these contributions obey ifts and thus are rigorously positive in the mean .",
    "furthermore we have demonstrated that whilst these two naturally align themselves with the irreversibility associated with relaxation , and non - equilibrium constraints , respectively , the inclusion of odd dynamical variables can give rise to a third term , which has no bounds on its sign and which can not be so readily associated with one origin of entropy production or the other .",
    "we have sought to make these expressions as general as possible , within reason , with the intention that they may be applied to any system ( physical or otherwise ) described by stochastic differential equations , providing a framework for the discussion of entropy production , as defined here , within as wide a range of applications as may be relevant . to this end , we have considered a simple heat conduction problem , and after demonstrating that a full phase space representation of the dynamics is crucial to the treatment of its entropy production , we have examined specifically how it may be evaluated .",
    "the second example , that of a transition between stationary states of drift - diffusion on a ring , demonstrates the need for a third contribution to entropy production in the analysis , and provides some intuitive understanding of its nature .",
    "+   + we suggest that the division of the total entropy production into @xmath60 , @xmath62 and @xmath64 , as we propose , is always helpful for three main reasons .",
    "the first is the ability to identify the physical origins of irreversibility in a process ( relaxation and non - equilibrium constraints ) and the interplay between them .",
    "the second is related to the identification of ifts with the subsequent positivity requirements and restrictions on the statistics for the two contributions , @xmath60 and @xmath62 , which unambiguously align themselves with the two causes of irreversibility . and thirdly , the more delicate reason that all three contributions are constructed from total path probability densities with equivalent measures such that they align themselves unambiguously with the same contributions found in master equation approaches which are necessarily formed from path _ probabilities _ @xcite .",
    "this third point may be contrasted with an alternative division of the total entropy production into a system and medium contribution , neither of which can be expressed as ratios of total path probabilities . being formed from a probability density , the system entropy , as defined in @xcite and employed here ( eq .  ( [ sysmed ] ) implies @xmath286 ) , is strictly not dimensionally correct ( even if one argues that the relative entropy change is well defined @xcite ) , but moreover does not share the same form as the system entropy that appears in master equation approaches , which if followed would imply @xmath287 .",
    "such ambiguity then also enters into the definition of the medium entropy , but can be avoided altogether by considering the total entropy production in terms of explicit measures of irreversibility such that @xmath104 is comprised of @xmath60 , @xmath62 and @xmath64 , all four of which do not suffer from such issues .",
    "+   + generalisations that are immediately obvious beyond the description given here may include correlated stochastic processes for which the method described should prove suitable , and processes where we no longer assume @xmath19 for which the generalisation may be more challenging .",
    "one might note , however that processes which do not possess such a symmetry are unlikely to be physically meaningful .",
    "furthermore , it would be natural to explore examples involving odd dynamical variables such as angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments , and to include driving by external forces that are themselves odd under time reversal , such as torques and magnetic fields .",
    "we expect to find further richness in the phenomenology of entropy production associated with stochastic dynamical behaviour .",

    ". we may proceed by understanding that the quantity @xmath112 is an increment in an underlying sde , meaning that we must consider all multiplications of the form @xmath289 as infinitesimal stochastic integrals with a summation rule defined by the evaluation point @xmath290 .",
    "for example , @xmath291 would imply an ito integration , @xmath292 would imply stratonovich and so on . to consolidate the above it is sensible to convert all multiplications into one type , for which we choose ito in order to apply the ito stochastic calculus transparently using the heuristic rules @xmath293 and @xmath294 , and to drop all terms of order @xmath295 and higher . to do",

    "we use a similar reasoning to approximate @xmath305 which along with the approximations to _ second _ order in @xmath112 , and therefore @xmath306 , of the following form : @xmath307 and an ito definition of @xmath308 , allow us to write the first four terms in eq .",
    "( [ ratiofull ] ) to first order in @xmath68 as @xmath309 using the above , and the heuristic rules in eqs .",

    "we note , however that without multiplicative noise ( ie . for @xmath311 ) , where the inherent mathematical ambiguity in stochastic integrals is absent , the dependence on evaluation points ( @xmath74 and @xmath82 ) disappears .",
    "so this dependence is evidently related to the ambiguity of evaluation point in a stochastic integral",
    ". however , the underlying sdes and entropy are not , and should not be , ambiguous since we have specified ito sdes and have used the short time propagator appropriate for their corresponding fokker - planck equation . since all evaluation points lead to the correct path probability density we are not obliged to consider , for example , only ito - type multiplication ( @xmath312 ) simply because the underlying sdes are of ito form .",
    "rather , to proceed we recognise that with multiplicative noise we must ensure that we evaluate the two transition probability densities at precisely the same coordinates and not just at same time ( which would suffice for additive noise ) , for the same reasons that make stochastic integration sensitive to the specific integration scheme when the integrand has dependence on the integrating variable .",
    "alternatively it may be reasoned that as @xmath79 we require the short time propagators to approach jump transition probabilities of a master equation .",
    "under such a description the entropy production can be unambiguously described by the ratios of probabilitities appearing in a master equation approach @xcite . therefore , if we represent such a quantity using the short time propagators we require the transition rates in both numerator and denominator to be evaluated equivalently .",

    "<S> the third , however , is not and furthermore can not be uniquely associated with irreversibility arising from relaxation , nor with the breakage of detailed balance brought about by non - equilibrium constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the various contributions to total entropy production are explored through the consideration of two examples : steady state heat conduction due to a temperature gradient , and transitions between stationary states of drift - diffusion on a ring , both in the context of the full phase space dynamics of a single brownian particle . </S>"
