    "the usual exchange - correlation potentials ( lda or gga ) underestimate the electronic correlations such as the coulomb correlation and the orbital polarization , thus the obtained orbital moments in this work are generally small compared with experimental values  @xcite although our work includes the spin - orbit coupling interaction .",
    "the small values of orbital moments of the absorbed cr atoms in our calculations are not related to the crystal field but to its electronic structure . in the individual cr atom ,",
    "five 3d - electrons half - fill the 3d states , the total orbital moment is very small .",
    "the coordination number of surface atoms is generally smaller than those in bulk .",

    "the lack of the orbital polarization is nt the obstacle to study the structural influence on the orbital moments . in order to clearly illustrate the effects of the crystal deformations ( or the cubic distortions ) , we compare the results on the deformed surface with that on the prefect au(110)-(1@xmath12 ) surface .",
    "the absorbed 3d atoms on the prefect surface still modify their positions to reach their stable positions , while the surface atoms are fixed .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the surface relaxations generally quench the orbital moments of the absorbed 3d atoms except for the absorbed v and ti atoms .",
    "the changes of the orbital moments in response to the relaxations are closely related to the changes of the depth of the 3d atoms embedded in the trough of the reconstructed au(110 ) surface .",
    "the absorbed atoms are deeper in the through , their orbital moments are quenched to smaller values due to the stronger crystal field . the absorbed v atom rises above the top row of the trough after the relaxations and its orbital moment enhances , opposes to the orbital quenching for the other 3d atoms except for the absorbed ti atom .",
    "this is due to the weaker crystal field above the surface than that in the trough .",
    "the absorbed ti atom has almost the same height as the top row after the relaxations and its orbital moment slightly increases .",
    "thus our results indicate that the surface relaxation decreases the orbital moments of the absorbed 3d atoms with the excess half - filled 3d states and increases the orbital moments of the absorbed atoms with less half - filled 3d states on au(110)-(1@xmath12 ) surface .",
    "the 3d density of states of the absorbed 3d atoms on the two surfaces are shown in fig .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy is nt good fit with @xmath70 in s@xmath59 .",
    "the underlaying reasons are ( 1 ) there is nt simple cubic symmetry in the region where the one - dimensional atomic chain absorbed ; ( 2 ) the heterogeneously distributed the nearest nearby distances along the chain induced by the lattice misfit between the chain and the substrate . on the other hand , the value of @xmath73 is close to the lowest limit of allowed error in total energy about @xmath760.1mev , thus more accurate calculations are required .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy energies for ni chains on the reconstructed au(110 ) surface are close to the values of magnetic film .",
    "this is because the atoms on ni chain replace the atoms of first layer of original surface and have almost the same coordinate number in their monolayer film .",

    "the larger densities of states at fermi energy contributed by the minority - spin - down dos indicate that there are larger spin and orbital moment magnetic moments for free - standing ni chain .",
    "we only consider the changes of the total energies with the angle @xmath80 . from the fig .",

    "the anisotropy energy is large compared with the surface - supported ni@xmath51 chain .",
    "the change of the sign of @xmath73 compared with surface - supported chain means that the easy magnetization axis change in s@xmath59 plane .",
    "the change of the easy magnetization axis had been found in other theoretical works such as co chains on pd(110 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the changes of easy magnetization axis are found in the growth of magnetic film on metal surface when the thickness of film is beyond a critical value @xmath81 .",

    "the spin moment about 1.14@xmath54 per atom is significantly large than its values in ni crystal 0.675@xmath54 .",
    "the behavior of the orbital moment is similar to the surface - supported ni@xmath51 chain , that is , reaches the minimum when perpendicularly magnetizing the chain .",
    "the underlaying reason is geometric , that is , the orbital currents ( or molecular currents ) of neighbor atoms have large overlapping and their cancelations are also large which is disadvantageous to form larger orbital moments .",
    "the values of orbital moments from 0.2@xmath54 to 0.6@xmath54 are larger one power of the values of surface supported ni atoms .",
    "the easy magnetization axis of free - standing ni chain a-[1@xmath30 ] is different from the easy magnetization axis of surface - supported chain c-[110 ] .",
    "the orbital moment reaches its maximum along the easy magnetization axis a-[1@xmath30 ] , @xmath65 for free standing chain , which is consistent with the results for magnetic monolayer ,  @xcite but reaches the minimum along the easy magnetization c-[110 ] axis @xmath67 for the surface - supported chain .",
    "thus our results show that the surface effects change the easy magnetization axis and decrease both the magnetic anisotropy energy and the magnetic moment of free standing chains because of the increase of coordination number for every atom on a surface .",
    "based on the density functional theory , we have calculated the magnetic anisotropy of the supported ni chains and free - standing chain .",
    "the easy magnetization axis of the supported ni chain is perpendicular to the chain and surface but parallel to the chain for free standing chain .",
    "the different easy magnetization axis for the supported and free standing chain is also found in density functional calculations of other system .",
    "our results indicate the closed relationship between the magnetic anisotropy and orbital moments of the ni chains . in the environments of crystal ,",

    "compared with spin moment , orbital moment is more sensitive to the change of magnetization direction .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy of materials are determined both by the orbital quenching and spin - orbit coupling . for a single absorbed atom",
    ", the surface relaxations generally deform the surface and modify the positions of the absorbed atoms .",
    "if the relaxations lift the absorbed atom out of the trough on the constructed au(110 ) surface , the orbital moments enhance due to weaker crystal fields and if the relaxations make the absorbed atoms deeper embedded in the trough the orbital moments quench to smaller values due to the stronger crystal fields .",
