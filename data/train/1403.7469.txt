    "the study of out - of - equilibrium dynamics of isolated many - body quantum systems has seen great progress during the last decade . in particular ,",
    "much theoretical progress was made in the field of one - dimensional quantum integrable models .",
    "out - of - equilibrium realizations of these models , despite being strongly - correlated @xcite and having a complete set of algebraically independent conserved quantities , are believed to exhibit relaxation behaviour .",
    "this relaxation can be described , in principle , by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) @xcite . an alternative way was recently proposed in the context of a quantum quench , the so - called `` quench action approach '' @xcite .",
    "this first - principles - based analysis of time - evolved expectation values of physical observables uses as input the overlaps of the initial state with energy eigenstates . after a saddle - point approximation that is exact in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "it predicts both the time evolution of expectation values of physical observables and their long - time stationary values . to obtain the latter ,",
    "one in particular needs the leading order term of the overlaps in the thermodynamic limit .    despite the fact that slavnov s theorem @xcite gives overlaps between eigenstates of a bethe ansatz - solvable @xcite hamiltonian with ( in principle ) generic states , until recently very little",
    "was known about overlaps between eigenstates of two hamiltonians of the same family but at different values of interaction ( here , we primarily focus on two xxz chains with different anisotropies , one of which is in the ising limit ) .",
    "it is these overlaps that are required for the application of the quench action approach to interaction quenches . for the lieb - liniger model ,",
    "exact overlaps of the ground state for an even number of free bosons ( bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state ) and energy eigenstates at generic finite interaction parameter were conjectured in @xcite and thereafter proven in @xcite .",
    "their form resembled the gaudin determinant form for norms of bethe states @xcite , and was suitable for analysis in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this made an application of the quench action approach possible , leading to a description of the stationary state at late times after the quench .",
    "surprisingly , and in contrast to thermal properties of the lieb - liniger gas , this description turned out to yield a closed - form solution in the thermodyamic limit , for any ( repulsive ) value of the final interaction strength . of particular interest was the conclusion that these results remain inaccessible to gge - based calculations @xcite .    in the context of spin chains , in @xcite",
    "overlaps between the nel state and parity - invariant xxz bethe states with an even number of down spins were derived from an earlier form of the overlaps @xcite .",
    "this new form has the same gaudin - like structure as the lieb - liniger overlaps and therefore can be treated in the thermodynamic limit as done in @xcite .",
    "note that this result is still restricted to an even number of down spins .",
    "in this paper we present a derivation of the overlaps of the zero - momentum nel state and parity - invariant bethe states , but now in the sectors of odd numbers of down spins .",
    "we also take the scaling limit to the lieb - liniger model and present the overlaps between the bec state and bose gas bethe states with an odd number of bosons .",
    "the calculations are not trivial and the results show a slightly different structure of the determinant as compared to the even particle case @xcite",
    ". these new overlap formulas may be specifically useful in broader contexts , such as in their relation to exact solutions of the 1d kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike the lieb - liniger case , up to now a proof that non - parity - invariant xxz bethe states have vanishing overlaps with the initial nel state was lacking . in this paper",
    "we present this proof , both for an even and odd number of down spins .",
    "the relevance for the quench action approach is clear , as the time evolution of expectation values is governed by a double sum over the complete hilbert space , including non - parity - invariant states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : xxzchain ] we review the bethe ansatz solution of the xxz chain and recall the gaudin norm formula of bethe states @xcite , which will be used in subsequent sections . in section",
    "[ sec : oddandnpi ] we present the derivation of the overlap formula with parity - invariant bethe states with an odd number of down spins , and we prove that non - parity - invariant states have zero overlap with the nel state . in section [ sec : scaling_ll ] we perform the scaling limit to the lieb - liniger bose gas and present the bec overlap formula for an odd number of bosons .",
    "the model which we initially focus on is the well - known spin-@xmath1 anisotropic heisenberg chain with hamiltonian @xmath2 since we are interested in antiferromagnetic cases , the overall exchange coupling constant is taken to be positive , @xmath3 .",
    "the exchange anisotropy is parametrized as @xmath4 with @xmath5 being a free parameter ( we will in practice of course limit ourselves to real @xmath6 ) .",

    "we shall write that a bethe state of the form is `` on - shell '' if the parameters @xmath25 satisfy bethe equations .",
    "in contrast , we will write `` off - shell '' if they are arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "we further call a bethe state parity - invariant if they obey the symmetry condition @xmath30 , where , for generic @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath31 or @xmath32 , @xmath33 not a root of unity , we identify rapidities when their imaginary parts differ by @xmath34 .",
    "this in particular means that the two points @xmath35 are identified .",
    "hence , adding a single rapidity at @xmath36 to a parity - invariant set of rapidities does not destroy this symmetry . in the root - of - unity case ,",
    "e.g.  when @xmath37 , we consider rescaled rapidities , e.g.  @xmath38 or @xmath39 respectively , and we identify the two points @xmath40 , because in these special cases bethe equations allow for these type of solutions .",
