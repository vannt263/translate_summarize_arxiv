    "the radio emission of normal galaxies is directly connected with activity of star formation and results from two processes , non - thermal ( synchrotron ) and thermal ( free - free ) radiation .",
    "the synchrotron emission dominates the @xmath0ghz range . at higher frequencies free - free emission becomes increasingly important . at much lower radio frequencies free - free absorption",
    "may affect not only thermally generated photons but also synchrotron ones .",
    "due to this absorption the radio spectra of galaxies can be flattened towards low frequencies .",
    "the galactic centre ( gc ) hosts a compact non - thermal radio source known as sgr a*. around sgr a * radio emission comes from hii region called sgr a west , embedded in lower density ionized gas forming extended ( @xmath1 ) halo ( pedlar el al .",
    "1989 ) . behind the sgr a west",
    "there is a source , which seems to be a supernova remnant ( snr ) known as sgr a east . around sgr a east",
    "there is a @xmath2 radio envelope , showing thermal and non - thermal emission . at low radio frequencies ( @xmath3610mhz )",
    "the most striking feature of the radio emission of sgr a is its strong depression in the region of sgr a west which at higher frequencies dominates the radio image .    in modelling of the radio spectrum of the whole sgr a complex consisting of sgr a west , sgr a east , and sgr a *",
    ", we assume three gaseous components of different sizes and radiating according to thermal and/or synchrotron processes .",
    "the emission of all components is modelled over a grid of nxn cells .",
    "each simple cell radiates according to : @xmath4\\ , \\omega_{ij}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the optical depth and @xmath6 is the emission measure with the filling factor @xmath7 .    the modelled spectrum of sgr a integrated over the whole complex fits very well the data points ( fig . 1 : left).the modelled turnover in the spectrum of sgr a near 1 ghz requires emission measures @xmath8 .",
    "this provides the thermal emission contaminating the high frequency part of the spectrum . to explain the data points it was also necessary to introduce the filling factor @xmath9 of about 0.1 in the part of the model associated with the thermal emission .",

    "the galaxy m82 hosts the nearest example of an ongoing starburst .",
    "the brightest source at 408mhz ( wills et al .",
    "1997 ) is a snr in the centre of the disk . around this snr",
    "there is a depression in radio emission of about 100pc in size caused by free - free absorption induced by a giant hii region .",
    "we performed modelling of the global spectrum of m82 similarly to sgr a complex , but for the whole galaxy ( figure 1:centre ) .",
    "the shape of low frequency spectrum depends on the distribution and density of the ionized gas in the whole galactic disc . at fixed frequencies",
    ", we reconstructed the observed radio emission over the galactic disk .",
    "figure 1 : right depicts some modelled maps at 300 and 1400 mhz . with lower resolution",
    "the depression in emission in the centre of m82 is systematically less visible , at 408 mhz and with spatial resolution of @xmath10 it even disappears completely .",
    "hence , recognition of such regions in more distant galaxies would be very difficult .",
    "our modelling shows that significant part of m82 ( more than 50% ) must be significantly contaminated by thermally emitting gas .",
    "it is not possible to reproduce the turnover in the spectrum of m82 assuming only one small emitting region but with extremely high density of ionized gas .",
    "the filling factor of the thermal emission may also play an important role in shaping the global spectrum of m82 ."
