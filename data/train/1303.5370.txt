    "open clusters have been a keystone in understanding stellar evolution because they contain stars at the same distance with similar reddening formed at the same time with the same chemical composition , at least to a first approximation .",
    "their members display a range of masses , temperatures , luminosities , rotation rates , and multiplicity which can be explored .",
    "comparison of cluster morphology provides an age sequence as a context for the evolution of stars .",
    "the well - known spin - down of low mass stars with age due to magnetic braking provides a good example of insight from clusters .",
    "this slowing of rotation results in the decrease of coronal x - rays due to their connection with stellar dynamos .",
    "good summaries of the decrease in stellar activity as stars age for a range of masses are provided by favata and micela ( 2003 ) and gdel ( 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath0 per is a young open cluster , found to be 50 myr old from upper main sequence turnoff morphology ( meynet , mermilliod , and maeder , 1993 ) .",
    "more recently , stauffer , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found an age of 90 myr from the low mass lithium depletion boundary . although there is some dispersion in the exact calibration of the age of the cluster",
    ", the sequence of age ( increasing from the orion nebula cluster through the @xmath0 per cluster through the pleiades ) is generally agreed .",
    "thus , studies find a range in age from 50 to 90 myr .",
    "we will use the shorthand `` 50 myr '' for the age of the cluster .",
    "this age makes it an excellent comparison for cepheids and their companions . indeed , @xmath0 per itself is a yellow supergiant , with similar parameters to cepheids , except for its location at a temperature outside the instability strip . as an example of usage of the cluster ,",
    "we have observed a number of cepheids with the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 to identify a population of resolved low - mass stars close to cepheids which are probable physical companions .",
    "x - ray observations showing an activity level comparable to that of @xmath0 per dwarfs would confirm that they are young companions rather than chance alignments with old field stars ( e.g. evans , et al .",
    "another interesting aspect of a cluster of this age is that it is the period when young planets have just finished forming , and thus we gain insight into the x - ray environment during the early formation of atmospheres .",
    "because the cluster is nearby , it covers a wide area in the sky .",
    "it was observed with a raster of pointings by _ rosat _ ( randich , et al .",
    "1996 ) . essentially all the late f , g , and k members from the membership studies of prosser ( 1992 ) were detected .",
    "three deeper pointed _ rosat _ observations ( 22 - 25 ks ) were subsequently made covering part of the cluster ( prosser , et al .",
    "two additional studies were made using near ir observations to try to identify counterparts of _ rosat _ sources ( prosser and randich 1998 ; prosser , randich , and simon 1998 , prs below ) . in the second of these , the authors identified a number of g and k stars with lower x - ray luminosity than expected for cluster members , which they termed `` bad l@xmath1 stars '' .",
    "finally , a deeper ( 60 ksec ) exposure of a small part of the cluster was made with xmm , which was described briefly by pallavicini , franciosini , and randich ( 2004 ) .",
    "this is the observation which we discuss here , which allows us to investigate fainter sources as well as the spectral properties of the sources .",
    "in addition to being relatively nearby ( 170 pc ; randich , et al .",
    "1996 ) , the @xmath0 per cluster is also lightly reddened ( e(b - v ) = 0.09 mag ; meynet , et al . 1993 ) , making the data interpretation relatively robust .",
    "the supergiant @xmath0 per itself was detected in the rosat observations ( prosser , et al .",
    "however , recently ayres ( 2011 ) has suggested that there is evidence that the x - rays might actually be produced by a low - mass x - ray active companion .    in this study",
    "we add the results of the deeper xmm image to the existing literature on the cluster .",
    "specifically , in the sections that follow , we discuss the observations , the source detection and near ir matches , the source parameters ( luminosity and spectra ) , the x - ray luminosity distribution ( xld ) , light curves , and the results .",
    "of particular importance in deriving the cluster parameters ( discussion section , section 4 ) is a grouping of stars likely to be a cluster of young stars behind the @xmath0 per cluster .",
    "a fraction of the @xmath0 per cluster was observed by xmm - newton as part of the mission scientist guaranteed time ( pallavicini , et al 2004 ) .",
    "a 60 ks observation was obtained in sept 5th 2000 - 09 - 05 using epic mos and pn cameras on board _ xmm - newton _ with a pointing at r.a .",
    ": @xmath2 and dec .",
    ": @xmath3 .",
    "1 shows the composite pn , mos  1 and mos  2 image of the epic field within the @xmath0 per cluster .",
    "we carried out data analysis similar to that in pillitteri , et al .",
    "we used the standard tasks of sas v10.0 to reduce the @xmath7 ( odf ) and obtain event tables calibrated in arrival time , energy and astrometry .",
    "first the events were filtered to be within the band 0.38.0 kev , appropriate for the coronal emission we want to investigate .",
    "good time intervals ( gtis ) were filtered out after inspecting the light curve of events at energies higher than 10 kev and removing high background intervals ( with rate thresholds of @xmath82.5 ct s@xmath9 for pn and @xmath80.5 ct s@xmath9 for mos ) .",
    "this optimizes the event lists for the detection of faint x - ray sources ."
