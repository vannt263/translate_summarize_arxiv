    "super lithium rich giants ( slir ) are an elusive class of objects , serendipitously discovered .",
    "the presence of a substantial amount of li in ` normal ' giants is already a puzzle , because , according to current evolutionary theories , very little li should have remained in the stellar atmosphere of these stars shortly after they leave the main sequence , and they are not expected to produce any substantial amount before the cameron - fowler ( @xcite ) mechanism becomes active , i.e. before the star gets to the tip of the giant branch and onto the agb .    in their survey for lithium rich giants , brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found out of 644 giants , 8 lithium rich giants ( @xmath1  dex ] ) and only 2 with lithium abundances close to the current interstellar value ( @xmath2  dex ) , while the compilation by de la reza ( @xcite,@xcite ) quote @xmath340 lithium rich giants . with the exception of a recently discovered red giant belonging to the globular cluster m3 ( kraft et al .",
    "@xcite ) , all the other giants with @xmath2  dex belong to the field , and what we report here is the first detection of such an object in an open cluster . this should help us to precisely position the star in the colour - magnitude diagram , to assess its evolutionary status , initial mass , age and metallicity .    among possible theories of li enhancement , pollution from an evolved companion , engulfing of a lithium rich low mass ( brown dwarf ) companion , self production and shell detachment ( de la reza et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) have been proposed .",
    "four giants in the core of be  21 were observed with feros , the new fibre - fed high resolution echelle spectrograph that has been installed in 1998 on the 1.52 m telescope in la silla and has proven to be very stable and sensitive .",
    "the spectra were obtained during the commissioning period in november 1998 ( kaufer et al .",
    "several exposures were obtained per star and the data were reduced by using the feros on line data reduction system . since feros also provides simultaneous sky spectra ( from a dedicated fiber ) , for these relative faint stars the sky spectra were used to check for the presence of emission lines in the regions of interest .",
    "no detectable sky continuum was found , and therefore we preferred not to subtract the sky spectra , in order not to lower the s / n ratio of the spectra which is @xmath4 ( a quite remarkable result , considering that feros is fed by the eso 1.52 m telescope ) .",
    "feros resolving power is of @xmath5 and feros is a rather stable instrument , providing accurate radial velocities .    a brief logbook of these observations is given in table  [ t - logbook ] , where the identification of the stars follows the numbering of tosi et al .",

    "the four radial velocities agree clearly very well at a   of 12.35@xmath10  , which is compatible to the intrinsic accuracy of feros without simultaneous calibration .",
    "we therefore conclude ( at odds with previous , less accurate measurements by friel & janes ( @xcite ) that the four giants are likely be  21 members and that the radial velocity of the be  21 cluster is 12.35  .",
    "the spectra were acquired in a short span one after the other ( at most one night difference ) and we do not find noticeable radial velocity variations among the different spectra .",
    "however , the brightest giant ( t9 ) shows a very broad an slightly assymetric correlation function , which reflects the complex and broad structure of its lines .",

    "( @xcite ) is shown in figure  [ f - hr ] , with the slir star marked as a circle .",
    "clearly , the colours and magnitudes of the four giants fit very well in the c - m diagram of the cluster and the three fainter giants observed are about 1 magnitude above the he - burning core clump . according to tosi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and their visual magnitudes , the absolute visual magnitude of the three stars is of @xmath11 .",
    "the model atmospheres that we used to derive the abundances were interpolated in a grid of models calculated with codes derived from the marcs , and especially adapted to represent the atmosphere of low gravity stars  : plez s ( @xcite and @xcite ) grid of models , with temperature and gravity ranges ( 3500@xmath12@xmath124750  k and 0.5@xmath12@xmath121.0  dex ) for metallicities 1.0 , 0.6 , 0.3 , 0 . , 0.3 , 0.6  dex .      to determine the effective parameters of the stars",
    "the following procedure was adopted :    * _ temperature : _ the @xmath7 and @xmath8 colours of the star are used to determine the effective temperature , which is then checked `` spectroscopically '' , imposing for the excitation equilibrium to be achieved ( lines with high and low excitation potential should produce the same abundance for a given element -here fe  i ) . * _ surface gravity : _ is derived from the ionisation equilibrium : we require that the iron abundance deduced from neutral and ionised species should be the same . * _ microturbulent velocity : _ is derived imposing that the iron lines with small and large equivalent width should give the same abundance .    to derive the input t@xmath13 we have started from the tosi et al .",
    "values of reddening : @xmath14 ( thus @xmath15 ) and we have applied these values to the stars . the effective temperature calibration of alonso et al .",
    "( @xcite ) has been then applied ; in fact , even if this calibration has been mostly developed for dwarf stars , models clearly show that in this range of temperature , it has a very little dependence on gravity , if at all ( cf bessell et al .",
    "the initial guess was found very close to the spectroscopic results , as shown in table  [ t - parameters ] , confirming indirectly the quality of the of the tosi et al . reddening analysis . in the same table , we note , however , that the spectroscopic and photometric gravities do not match very well , in that spectroscopic gravities ( derived from ionisation equilibrium ) give lower values than the photometric ones . this effect is well known in intermediate metallicity stars and it is due to the fact that the fe lines suffer of nlte effects ( mainly overionisation ) . in this case , however , the effect is larger than expected , and this might be due to the extremely small number of ionised lines that could be measured ( weak lines with @xmath16m   were impossible to measure reliably because of the s / n of the spectra ) . since the stars belong to a cluster , on the other hand we know that the real gravities can not be lower than the ones derived from the photometry by more than a factor 2 .",
    "we have therefore in the following the photometric gravities .",
    "this implies that the fe  ii lines were not used to determine the mean [ fe / h ] abundance .",

    "i line at 6104   is also included in our spectrum , we checked for this line , as given in figure  [ f - li61 ] .",
    "given the limited s / n ratio of the data , all we can say is that the line is present and the equivalent width ( @xmath24m ) is consistent with the abundance found from the 6708   resonance line",
    ".    for t26 and t27 , only an upper limit of @xmath25  dex can be derived , assuming 30m   for the detection limit of the 6708   line .",
    "the mechanisms proposed to explain slir giants can be basically divided in two type : pollution and self enrichment .",
    "pollution can happen either via the mass transfer in a binary system where the more massive star evolves first to a white dwarf and pollutes its companion by novae - explosions , or via the engulfing of a low mass companion ( i.e. brown dwarf ) rich in li .",
    "we can not at the moment exclude any of these mechanism .",
    "the two spectra of t33 were too close in time to detect radial velocity variations , and anyhow , major radial velocity variations are not expected when the companion is a white dwarf . also , we have no access to the be region to test the abundance of this material , which could rule out the bd engulfing scenario , as shown for two lithium rich field giants by castilho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "but the similarity of the radial velocity of this giant to the three others reduces the probability that it is a binary system . concerning the bd scenario , however , we note also that the difference in li abundance between t33 and the other two giants is so large ( a factor @xmath31000 ) that the engulfing hypothesis would have problems in providing such an amount of li ( siess & livio @xcite ) .",
    "also , in such a scenario , the engulfed low - mass companion would transfer angular momentum to the giant , leading to a substantial spin - up of the giant .",
    "this is not observed the case of t33 , which does not seem to be rotating any faster than the two similar giants t26 and t27 .",
    "a variation of the fowler - cameron self enrichment mechanism has been proposed by sackmann & boothroyd ( @xcite ) and it has been advocated by kraft et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as a possible explanation of their slir giant in m3 . at the moment",
    "this is an hypothesis , which possibly also needs of some link with the presence of dust shell as observed by de la reza et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . with respect to kraft s slir giant in m3",
    "we note that although t33 is more luminous than the cluster clump , its absolute magnitude is about 2 magnitudes fainter than the m3 star .",
    "the star in m3 is also substantially cooler .",
    "another comparison can be done with the other slir field star hd39853 ( gratton and dantona @xcite ) : with a metallicity similar to t33 its hipparcos parallax indicates that this star is about 1 magnitude brighter and substantially cooler than t33 : hd39853 should therefore be very similar to the be  21 star t9 , which does not show a strong li abundance .",
    "a possible argument in favour of pollution could be proposed : observations of li in giants of clusters are limited to some tens of objects , and , if the few cluster slir giants discovered so far were indicative of the trend , the percentage of slir giants in clusters could be higher than what is observed in the field ( cf .",
    "brown et al .",
    "this suggests therefore that environment may have an important role . on the other hand",
    ", we have also to note that these clusters are typically more metal poor than the field stars , and , for instance , the sackmann & boothroyd mechanism should work better at lower metallicities .",
    "however , a proper statistical analysis could only be performed if complete samples of cluster giants were observed , which is not the case at present , where only scarce lithium data are available for open cluster giants .",
