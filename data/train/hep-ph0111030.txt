    "the experimental study of the fundamental properties of neutrinos is one of the most challenging in particle physics , but it has also produced some of the most exciting and revolutionary physics insights , both on microscopic and astrophysical scales  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the electron neutrino emitted in beta decay in the 1950s confirmed the hypothesis in the early 1930s by pauli and fermi of the existence of the electron neutrino . shortly thereafter its left - handed nature was confirmed , the muon neutrino was discovered , and oscillations among three neutrino flavors were predicted .",
    "neutrino neutral currents were pivotal in the confirmation of the standard model in the 1970s .",
    "the number of active neutrino flavors was measured to be three by the lep experiments and by sld . however , despite immense experimental efforts , discovery of neutrino mass and flavor mixing remained beyond reach until deep underground experiments were carried out to observe neutrinos of extra - terrestrial origins .",
    "the study of the fundamental properties of neutrinos is now in a major discovery phase .",
    "there are good reasons to expect important neutrino discoveries to continue through the next two decades using new accelerator based neutrino sources , as will be summarized in this report .",
    "the rich new physics that can be explored will test the most basic tenets of particle theory : the masses and mixing of fermions and cp violation .",
    "one crucial breakthrough in neutrino mass studies occurred in the measurements of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray interactions .",
    "the decays of pions and muons produced by cosmic rays give a roughly isotropic flux of neutrinos at energies of a few gev that has the composition of about two @xmath0 to one @xmath1 .",
    "instead , the first experiments to measure neutrinos of atmospheric origin found a @xmath2 ratio which was about 60% of the expected value .",
    "this deficit was soon interpreted as evidence that oscillations occurred between the two flavors , but to decide which oscillations took place and the mass scale of the oscillations required larger detectors .",
    "the construction of the superkamiokande detector with 22.5 kilotons of ultra - pure water fiducial volume collected large statistics .",
    "a dependence of the @xmath2 event ratio on the zenith angle of the neutrino was found , with down - going neutrino events in agreement with expectation and up - going events a factor of about two below expectation @xcite .",
    "this important result , also confirmed by other experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite , establishes that muon neutrinos disappear as the baseline increases , while electron - neutrinos are observed at the expected rate at all baselines .",
    "the limits from reactor experiments support the latter inference .",
    "the most economical theoretical interpretation is that @xmath0 s oscillate to @xmath3 s with large mixing ( @xmath4 ) and mass - squared difference @xmath5 .",
    "the early results from the k2k experiment are more consistent with the oscillation interpretation than with no oscillations  @xcite ; the future minos and cngs long - baseline experiments have the potential to provide more precision and may for the first time observe the appearance of @xmath3 or even @xmath1 events from oscillations .",
    "another important breakthrough is that the long - standing solar neutrino problem is now known to be caused by the oscillation of electron neutrinos , at a mass scale well below that probed by atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "measured deficits in the solar neutrino flux of 1/2 to 1/3 compared to standard solar model predictions defied astrophysical explanation .",
    "now , when the electron neutrino flux measurement from the sno experiment is combined with the solar flux from superkamiokande , it is deduced that muon neutrino and tau neutrino contributions are seen at the 3 sigma level , confirming that neutrino flavor oscillations have occurred @xcite .",
    "global analyses of solar neutrino data find that the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution at @xmath6 is preferred , which is very fortunate since future long - baseline experiments can probe this mass scale .",
    "the kamland experiment is expected to measure both the square of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 to 10% accuracy if the solar solution is lma  @xcite@xcite .",
    "a complication to a three - neutrino oscillation interpretation is the lsnd data , which give evidence for @xmath9 oscillations at around the 1  ev@xmath10 scale , with a very small mixing amplitude @xcite .",
    "to have oscillations at three distinct mass - squared difference scales , a sterile neutrino with no standard model weak interactions must be invoked .",
    "the atmospheric and solar data still allow sterile neutrinos .",
    "the miniboone experiment will test the lsnd result in the near future @xcite . for most of this report",
    "we concentrate on the three neutrino scenario for brevity , but even richer oscillation phenomena may exist .",
    "sterile neutrinos have also been invoked in r - process nucleosynthesis and as warm dark matter .",
    "their existence is a profound issue that can only be directly probed in oscillation studies .",
    "the discovery of flavor oscillations has given us a first glimpse of the physics of neutrino mass , which has proven to be extremely interesting .",
    "the approximate bimaximal mixing form of the neutrino mixing matrix was totally unexpected , and shows us that the physics of the lepton sector is not a copy of the physics of the quark sector , wherein all mixings are small . the immediate challenge before us is to measure the small mixing angle between the first and third generation neutrino mass states , since that mixing is vital to neutrino interactions in matter and to cp violation in the lepton sector . in principle , the lepton sector is a better probe of fermion mass physics than the quark sector , since there are no complications from the strong interactions .",
    "the tools to develop neutrino mass physics into a precision science , using intense accelerator neutrino beams and large detectors , are within reach and the first steps with superbeams can be made at reasonable cost .",
    "long baselines are essential to probe both the atmospheric and solar mass scales , so the experiments necessarily involve different laboratories and possibly even different countries , making this a truly international scientific enterprise .",
    "more than one facility will be needed to resolve the fundamental questions before us .",
    "the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath11 are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath12 in vacuum by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 mixing matrix",
    ". it can be parametrized by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the extra diagonal phases are present for majorana neutrinos but do not affect oscillation phenomena .",
    "the vacuum oscillation probabilities are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , is the @xmath21-violating invariant , and @xmath22 , is the associated dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , here , @xmath25 .",
    "the plus ( minus ) sign is used when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are in cyclic ( anticyclic ) order , where cyclic order is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "the physical variable is @xmath29 , where @xmath23 is the baseline from source to detector and @xmath24 is the neutrino energy . only for the lma solution is the secondary mass scale sufficiently large that @xmath21-violation can be probed at long baselines  @xcite .",
    "the propagation of neutrinos through matter is described by the evolution equation  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the amplitude for coherent forward charged - current @xmath1 scattering on electrons , with @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the electron fraction and @xmath35 is the matter density . in the earth s crust and mantle ,",
    "the average density is typically 35  gm/@xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution equations can be solved numerically taking into account the dependence of the density on depth using the density profile from the preliminary reference earth model@xcite .    with three neutrinos",
    "there are two independent @xmath7 , and @xmath38 is indicated by the atmospheric and solar oscillation evidence .",
    "a recent analysis of the super - kamiokande ( 79 kton - yr ) and the macro atmospheric neutrino data finds and @xmath39 at the 95% confidence level with the best - fit at @xmath40 ev@xmath10 and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the best fit solution to the latest solar neutrino data , @xmath42 ev@xmath10 and @xmath43 , lies in the lma region with and @xmath44 at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "note that the msw solution selects @xmath45 .",
    "the sign of @xmath46 can be either positive or negative , corresponding to having the most widely separated mass eigenstate above or below the other two mass eigenstates .",
    "the current generation of nuclear reactor experiments ( palo verde and chooz ) find null oscillation results and rule out @xmath47 oscillations for @xmath48 @xmath49 at maximal mixing and for larger @xmath50 ( at the 95% confidence level ) @xcite .",
    "approximate formulas for the oscillation probabilities in matter of constant density in the limit , have been derived  @xcite . expanding in @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath53 probabilities for @xmath54 are @xmath55 respectively , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 note that the existence of matter effects ( @xmath58 ) makes it possible to discriminate between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and thereby determine if there are two heavy mass eigenstates or just one ( assuming the mass differences themselves are on the order of the highest mass eigenstate ) . the corresponding probability for a @xmath61-reversed channel",
    "is found by changing the sign of the @xmath62 term .",
    "the formulas are valid at @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 km for all values of @xmath65 currently favored by solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the corresponding expansion in @xmath26 and @xmath66 in vacuum can be found by the substitutions @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "approximate analytic expressions for the probabilities for low energy beams have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations can probe violations of the discrete symmetries @xmath21 , @xmath61 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath69 invariance is a basic property of local quantum field theory and no deviations from it have been found to date , but @xmath69 non - conservation may occur in string theory . if @xmath70 or @xmath71 , then @xmath69 is violated . if @xmath72 , @xmath21 is not conserved . if @xmath73 then @xmath61 invariance is violated . when neutrinos propagate through matter , fake @xmath21 and @xmath69 violation effects may be observed even if the mass matrix is @xmath21 conserving .",
    "however , matter - induced @xmath61-violating effects are negligible and are completely absent if the matter density - profile is symmetric with respect to the locations of the source and detector .",
    "the first imperative for the currently planned experiments is that they achieve their primary goals for sensitivity to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the next imperative is the detection of @xmath0 to @xmath1 at a baseline corresponding to the atmospheric mass splitting , and the determination of the angle @xmath66 , for which there presently exists only an upper limit .",
    "the minos and cngs experiments will have sensitivity down to @xmath76 , and the jhf proposal is slightly more sensitive ( and will be discussed more in detail later ) , but the appearance amplitude could be much smaller .",
    "in fact , some theoretical models suggest that @xmath77 could be at the @xmath78 to @xmath79 level @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is crucial to differentiate theoretical models of neutrino mass generation .",
    "only after @xmath66 is measured can cp studies and the determination of the sign of @xmath80 be achieved .",
    "the logical path to increased sensitivity at a reasonable cost is to upgrade conventional beams to higher intensity and concurrently construct a large underground detector at a suitable distance .",
    "the energy of the neutrino superbeam and the baseline to the detector must be selected to optimize the physics reach  @xcite . for the @xmath0 to @xmath1 oscillation",
    "to be nearly maximal , the average neutrino energy at a given baseline @xmath23 should be chosen such that @xmath81 .",
    "this choice also makes the @xmath0 to @xmath3 oscillation maximal , which aids in @xmath82-appearance studies with a neutrino energy well above the @xmath82-threshold energy of 3.56  gev .",
    "additionally , for cp studies , the @xmath83 dependence here is pure @xmath62 , with no @xmath84 contribution , which eliminates a @xmath66@xmath83 ambiguity .",
    "the above statements remain valid even in the presence of matter .",
    "a narrow band neutrino beam is advantageous in order to have all neutrinos near the same @xmath29 value and to eliminate backgrounds , which are significant in conventional beams .    to learn the most physics for the given investment of a large neutrino detector , it is important that the detector be chosen and housed such that it can also be used to study other phenomena .",
    "important areas of study which could also benefit from a new large underground detector include atmospheric and solar neutrino studies , and searches for both proton decay and neutrinos from supernovae .",
    "the lower the detector energy threshold , and the deeper underground the detector , the more physics it can access . since we do not know where the next hint of physics beyond the standard model will lie , it is important to keep as many avenues open as possible .",
    "the following sections of this report describe a set of conventional neutrino beamlines and detectors that could be used to take the next step in neutrino oscillation physics . where relevant , other non - accelerator physics possibilities will be mentioned .",
    "the physics capabilities for these conventional beamlines will be described , followed by a discussion of the capabilities of a neutrino factory .",
    "in fact , what new measurements the neutrino factory can provide depend critically on what the next few years of neutrino experimentation will tell us : what are the parameters of the solar neutrino oscillation ? is there a sterile neutrino sector ? is the small mixing angle between the third and first generation more than a per cent or so ?",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the different possible answers to these questions , and what we would learn in each case from a neutrino factory .",
    "there are currently three superbeam proposals which involve new neutrino beamlines directed towards large underground water cerenkov detectors . because of the wealth of experience now with water cerenkov detectors at extremely low neutrino energies ( at the sub - gev level ) , and the fact that a 50 kton detector already exists ,",
    "the reaches of these proposals have been evaluated with known detector effects and beam - related backgrounds .",
    "table [ tab : sb1 ] shows a summary of the physics reach of these proposals . in summary ,",
    "the jhf - based proposals involve building a beamline which can focus different momentum pions to make a narrow band beam to run at the oscillation peak , as is suggested above @xcite .",
    "the cern to uno proposal starts with a much lower energy proton beam and has inherently lower backgrounds , so they can reach comparable sensitivities with a wide band low energy neutrino beam @xcite .",
    ".physics sensitivity for current superbeam proposals [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the jhf project involves building a new neutrino beamline at the japanese hadron facility and aiming it toward the superkamiokande detector , at a distance of 295 km .",
    "this project has a few different models for narrow - band beams , each starting with the new 50gev proton source .",
    "the jhf facility itself has begun construction and is expected to finish in 2007 .",
    "the neutrino beamline could conceivably begin operations by 2008 , and is being designed to receive protons from a 0.77mw proton source . assuming that @xmath85 is above @xmath86",
    ", this facility could see @xmath9 at the three @xmath87 level if @xmath88 is larger than 0.016 , and after five years of data - taking .",
    "the jhf neutrino program also has an upgraded proposal , whereby both the beamline and the detector is augmented .",
    "the proton source itself would be upgraded to 4mw , and the beamline elements would have to be fortified accordingly .",
    "the new detector proposed , hyperkamiokande , is another water cerenkov device , but with 20 times the fiducial mass of the superkamiokande detector , located under the same mountain as the superkamiokande detector . with this increase of 100 in exposure ( in terms of kton - years )",
    "they expect to be able to see @xmath9 at 3@xmath87 if @xmath77 is larger than 0.0025 .",
    "if @xmath77 is 0.01 , and @xmath89 is @xmath90 , then cp violation could be observed if the cp phase @xmath83 is above 15 degrees ( assuming the expected mass hierarchy for matter effects ) , assuming a two year neutrino run , and a six year antineutrino run .    finally , there is a proposal which makes use of the superconducting proton linac at cern , which will be a 2.2gev proton source , operating potentially at 4mw . the 2.2gev proton beam will be used to make a 300mev neutrino beam , with very low ( and variable ) intrinsic @xmath1 background . by aiming this beam at a cavern in the frejus tunnel , located 150 km away",
    ", they could measure @xmath91 if @xmath77 is larger than 0.0025 , similar to the sjhf to hyperk proposal .",
    "cp violation could be observed if the phase @xmath83 is larger than 40 degrees ( for the same parameters mentioned above ) assuming a two year neutrino run , and a ten year antineutrino run .",
    "the choice to use low energy neutrino beams in the experiments in table [ tab : sb1 ] was motivated by several factors : for the cern to uno proposal , the intense proton source will be at 2.2gev , requiring a very low energy beam , which has in turn a very low electron neutrino background . also for these experiments , the performance of water cerenkov at these energies is very well understood . in the following section a case will be made for more than one superbeam , and in particular one at significantly higher energies than these two proposals .",
    "it is an important exercise , however , to understand how different energy beamlines compare . in the following section",
    ", it is assumed the flux achievable at one baseline is constant with energy as an exercise .    to produce an on - axis narrow band neutrino beam one focuses a given momentum bite of pions .",
    "however , for different momentum bites , one would want to direct the beam to different baselines .",
    "figure [ fig : pbeam ] ( left ) shows the event distribution at 730 km coming from for a perfectly focused `` monochromatic '' pion beams , which were produced by 120gev protons striking a 1 m graphite target @xcite . to understand how the unoscillated fluxes would scale for perfectly focused narrow band beams",
    ", the distribution is shown in fractional energy bands ( i.e. assume a perfectly focused pion beam with a constant fractional momentum bite at each energy ) . the most useful way to understand the beamline capability as a function of energy is to divide the event rate for that momentum bite by the square of the energy , since if one is operating at a given multiple of the peak the baseline ( @xmath23 ) scales like the energy , and of course the event rate for these baselines scales like @xmath92 .",
    "the result of that operation is shown in figure [ fig : pbeam ] on the right , for the same target and proton beam .",
    "as the pions one is trying to focus get higher in energy they are boosted more forward , so the far detector sees even more events than the @xmath92 scaling takes away .",
    "however , once the @xmath93 energies are above about 5gev the scaled rates drop , because much fewer high energy mesons are produced by 120gev protons .",
    "also , the finite length of the decay tunnel will also affect the highest energies  for the plot shown here the entire beamline is assumed to be 725 m long .",
    "clearly one also needs to understand how efficient the focusing can be as a function of pion energy , as well as the possibilities for off - axis neutrino beams , which can also provide narrow neutrino energy spectra .",
    ", at the oscillation peak , or ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "]      the measurement of the transition of @xmath9 is extremely important and helps link the solar and atmospheric anomalies together . although any one superbeam measurement would signal a breakthrough in our understanding of the mixing matrix , the nature of superbeams is such that the signal will not be background - free , and the interpretation of the result will depend significantly on the ability of any experiment to predict its background .",
    "furthermore , while the experiments outlined above have impressive sensitivity to the small mixing angle itself , they have no sensitivity to the sign of the largest mass splitting . in order to get the most information out of the @xmath9 transition ,",
    "it is important that there be an experiment which is sensitive to matter effects .",
    "superbeams in principle may be able to measure matter effects if @xmath66 is large enough , but not the programs outlined above .",
    "finally , the sjhf - hyperkamiokande proposal shows that matter effects are the same size as a change in the phase @xmath83 of about 8 degrees , in the lma scenario .",
    "if that experiment does indeed see evidence for cp violation before the sign of matter effects is known , then there will be an additional uncertainty in whether or not cp violation in the lepton sector does actually occur .",
    "extensive studies have already been made of superbeams from bnl and fermilab upgrades @xcite .",
    "for the discussion below we focus on physics results  @xcite that could be achieved with a 1.6  mw proton driver at fermilab to obtain a factor of four intensity increase over the numi medium energy beam .",
    "similar fluxes could be obtained with a bnl superbeam , so our conclusions should apply generally to either facility . to represent the anticipated flux loss in making a narrow band neutrino beam , we divide the flux estimate by a factor of five .",
    "both liquid argon and megaton water cerenkov detectors are under active consideration , and similar sensitivities to oscillation physics can be achieved with either detector .",
    "our examples of the physics reach below are based on a liquid argon detector with an effective 70  kt - yr of data accumulation for detecting @xmath1 s ( e.g. , a 70kt liquid argon detector with 50% efficiency with 2 years of running ) . for @xmath3 detection a 3.3kt - yr exposure will be assumed ( e.g. a 5kt detector with 33% efficiency and 2 years of data taking ) .",
    "antineutrino event rates are three to six times lower than neutrino rates , and correspondingly longer running times are required to accumulate comparable numbers of events .",
    "we assume a @xmath1 fractional background ( @xmath95 ) ( which includes both detector and beam backgrounds ) of 0.4% of the unoscillated cc signal , and a fractional uncertainty on the background of @xmath96 of 10% . for concrete illustrations , we assume @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , recognizing that the physics reach is somewhat dependent on the oscillation parameters .",
    "matter effects are taken into account . a range of baselines from 350  km to 2900  km is considered , with the corresponding optimal energies from 1  gev to 8.2  gev , respectively .    in this superbeam scenario ,",
    "the neutrino event rate in two years running at a 350  km baseline ( e.g. , bnl to cornell ) would be 15 times that expected for 5 years running in the jhf to superkamiokande experiment at a 295  km baseline .",
    "hence , superbeams offer a dramatic improvement in the @xmath77 reach .",
    "the @xmath0 to @xmath1 appearance sensitivity at @xmath101 for baselines from 350  km to 2900  km is , respectively , 0.002 to 0.003 , an order of magnitude below the reach of the upcoming long baseline experiments with conventional beams .",
    "figure [ fig : newbk ] shows the typical sensitivity of the @xmath77 reach to @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the sensitivity of a liquid argon or steel  based detector is best improved by increasing the size , while for a water cerenkov detector it is best improved by lowering the backgrounds and/or systematic uncertainty on the background .",
    "the cp phase @xmath83 can be measured down to 40 degrees at @xmath101 for @xmath102 . however , at the short 350  km baseline , matter effects are small , so there is very little sensitivity to the sign of @xmath80 .",
    "reach that correspond to a @xmath9 signal that is @xmath101 above background for an upgraded numi medium energy beam with detector at @xmath103  km .",
    "the contours are shown in the @xmath104plane , where @xmath105 is the data  sample size .",
    "curves are shown for systematic uncertainties @xmath106  0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.02 .",
    "three typical detector scenarios are shown : a ( liquid argon ) , f ( steel  based ) , and w ( water cerenkov ) ( from reference 17 ) . ]    at baselines above 1200  km , matter significantly affects appearance rates and the neutrino mass - hierarchy can be resolved .",
    "for example , at 1290  km ( e.g. , fermilab to homestake ) the sign of @xmath80 can be determined at a three @xmath87 reach of 0.01 on @xmath77 , which improves by a factor of two at 2900 km . moreover , due to the higher optimal energies for long baselines , @xmath3 appearance studies become feasible at distances of 1290 km and above .",
    "for example , @xmath107 @xmath3 events would be observed at 1290 km ( @xmath108 events at 1770 km , fnal - carlsbad or bnl - soudan ) . however , there is no sensitivity to the cp phase at these distances .    a novel idea for a superbeam which resembled the front end of a neutrino factory",
    "was proposed at this workshop . with all the proposals outlined above",
    ", the assumption is that the secondary beam focusing will be done primarily with horns , and so the beam will be either neutrinos or antineutrinos . for the target and focusing of a neutrino factory , there will be solenoidal focusing and therefore a mixed @xmath109 ) beam . if the far detector could measure the outgoing charge of the electron ( and muon )",
    "then it could search for @xmath9 and @xmath53 simultaneously .",
    "also , a solenoidal focusing system would have a much lower failure rate than a horn system at a high proton power source , since there would be no material in the secondary beam .",
    "recent studies have shown that a liquid argon calorimeter might be able to measure the charge of outgoing electrons up to a gev @xcite , so for a low energy solenoid - focused neutrino superbeam , this could be an attractive option @xcite . a superbeam detector which could identify lepton charge",
    "could then also be used as the far detector for a neutrino factory beam .    furthermore , longer baselines ( for example , those where @xmath110 ) with superbeams may be useful for studies of cp violation , due to the fact that the asymmetry increases linearly with baseline length in the small @xmath111 approximation @xcite .",
    "if the asymmetries one is trying to measure are larger , then fixed fractional uncertainties on background fluxes , detector acceptances , etc , become less important .",
    "the challenge in that case is to provide an intense enough neutrino flux to produce enough events in the far detector , and to make sure that matter effects do not enter in so much as to obscure the asymmetry .",
    "there is thus a complementarity of superbeam experiments at short and long baselines .",
    "experiments at the first oscillation maximum can search for the oscillation itself and are most sensitive to seeing @xmath66 if it is very small .",
    "experiments at higher multiples of the oscillation maximum may be able to test for cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "experiments at higher energies and long baselines can determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure @xmath3 appearance .",
    "we conclude that the full physics of the neutrino sector can only be explored with superbeams at short and long baselines .",
    "the first two requirements for a neutrino detector for a superbeam is that it can identify both @xmath0 and @xmath1 charged current interactions , and measure the total neutrino energy of the neutrino interaction . at lower neutrino energies",
    "the neutrino cross section is primarily quasielastic , so the detector simply must identify an outgoing muon or electron .",
    "however , for neutrino energies above a gev there is substantial hadronic activity accompanying most neutrino scattering events , and the difference between the detectors discussed below lies in their abilities to identify that accompanying hadronic activity .",
    "it is important , however , that these large superbeam detectors also contribute to other important areas of physics , since they will no doubt be costly devices . by housing these detectors",
    "deep underground , they could also make advances in the search for proton decay , supernovae detection , and solar and atmospheric neutrino studies . since we do not know where the next physics beyond the standard model will surface , it is important that we not neglect these other areas .",
    "water cerenkov detectors have been the most studied devices for superbeams , since they have provided some of the most convincing signals for neutrino oscillation . also , superkamiokande is the most massive neutrino detector constructed to date that would work in a superbeam .",
    "although they have been proven to work extremely well at neutrino energies below 1gev , it remains to be seen how well the detector concept would work for higher energy neutrino beams .",
    "the largest uncertainty is how well they could reject backgrounds from higher energy neutrino neutral current interactions which contain energetic @xmath112 s which decay asymmetrically , producing an electromagnetic - like ring in the detector .",
    "there is much work continuing on different techniques for cerenkov light collection , as well as different techniques for focusing the light itself to improve the signal .",
    "a novel idea proposed at this workshop is similar to a segmented iron calorimeter but uses water as the sensitive material .",
    "the cerenkov light is reflected inside a long thin water tank oriented transversely to the incoming neutrino direction ( a tank could be @xmath113 , and a calorimeter would consist of several hundred of these tanks ) . and",
    "is collected at the end of the tank by small photomultipliers .",
    "such a detector might be built at a moderate cost compared to a steel - based detector .",
    "a water tank prototype has been built at ihep , beijing , and tests with cosmic rays are underway .",
    "preliminary monte carlo study shows that its performance is similar to or better than those of steel - based calorimeters or cerenkov ring imaging detectors , particularly at energies higher than a few gev .",
    "unfortunately the limited number of photoelectrons for this configuration prevents it from being used for low energy physics , such as solar neutrino studies , in contrast to the single - volume water cerenkov devices .",
    "a liquid argon tpc , such as the one being built by the icarus collaboration , would be an extremely powerful device to use for a neutrino superbeam .",
    "the detector is basically an electronic bubble chamber , and would be able to detect individual tracks in the hadronic showers .",
    "studies based on geant simulations of the detector show that the neutral current background could be suppressed by three orders of magnitude , simply by looking at the energy loss in the first few radiation lengths of the electron candidate in the neutrino event .",
    "because of the superior vertexing , most shower - related backgrounds vanish .",
    "there is currently half of a 600ton module of instrumented liquid argon taking data on cosmic rays , and the data there look promising @xcite .",

    "one important unknown about the liquid argon technique is how large a single volume could used .",
    "the icarus proposal now has 600ton modules , but to avoid being prohibitively expensive , a much larger module size must be achieved .",
    "if one could instrument a volume the size of the superkamiokande detector with liquid argon , then it would be 70ktons .",

    "discussions with mining engineers have begun and have been encouraging @xcite . furthermore , a small volume of this detector should be placed in a neutrino beam shortly both to measure neutrino cross sections @xcite , and to understand how closely the actual performance mirrors the monte carlo prediction . finally ,",
    "if a magnetic field could be introduced in this detector , then it could be used for the solenoid - focused proposal discussed earlier , but would ultimately make an ideal detector for a neutrino factory beam .",

    "second , with a detector located at a long baseline , both the sign of @xmath80 and the cp phase can be determined .",
    "interestingly , the intrinsic cp violating effects are absent at 7300 km ( e.g. , fermilab to gran sasso ) and maximal cp violation occurs at a baseline of about 2900 km  @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "keep in mind that at the time of this document we only know that there are three indications of oscillations with non - overlapping mass splittings , and that for at least one of those mass splittings , the corresponding mixing angle appears to be large .",
    "the physics that a neutrino factory can provide depends on a few key factors , all of which will be determined within the next 5 years or so :    1 .   whether or not the lsnd signature is due to oscillations ; 2 .   if the solar neutrino anomaly is described by the lma solution ; and 3 .",

    "it becomes extremely important to try to measure every transition as accurately as possible , to try to understand the structure of the sterile neutrino sector : is there more than one sterile neutrino ?",
    "high energy neutrino beams will be needed at short baselines to study @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions to @xmath3 at the lsnd mass difference , as well as the antineutrino transitions .",
    "it becomes possible to observe cp violation in @xmath0 to @xmath1 at atmospheric mass difference baselines .",
    "the requirements for the short baseline experiments are much more modest in this scenario , and one can already start defining the sterile neutrino sector with an order of magnitude fewer muon decays per year than what has already been described in study ii @xcite .",
    "miniboone will have adequate sensitivity over the entire lsnd signal region to determine conclusively whether or not we are in this scenario @xcite .",
    "if the lsnd signature is not due to oscillations , then the next question that defines the scope of a neutrino factory is whether or not the solar neutrino anomaly is described by the large mixing angle solution , as is currently the most favored region .",
    "this will be determined by the kamland experiment , again in just a few years from now .    if kamland does see neutrino oscillations ,",
    "then whether or not cp violation is accessible depends on the value of the smallest mixing angle , @xmath137 .",

    ", @xmath83 must be large or matter effects must be measured , and the experiments proposed require extremely long run times ( see table above ) and depend on high background rejection in both neutrino and antineutrino running . in this scenario ,",
    "the reach of a neutrino factory will be purely statistics limited , and precision measurements of all of the oscillation parameters would be achievable .",
    "if kamland does see neutrino oscillations but the next generation of neutrino experiments does not see evidence for @xmath131 being non - zero , then cp violation and the sign of matter effects would only be accessible at a neutrino factory , as long as @xmath131 was larger than a few @xmath79 . for values smaller than that , @xmath1 to @xmath0 might still be seen , but it would be due to sub - leading oscillations , or the solar mass scale .    if kamland does not see neutrino oscillations , then cp violation measurements are not accessible at either a neutrino factory or a superbeam , and the physics we can hope to understand from oscillation measurements is `` only '' the size of @xmath137 and the sign of the largest mass splitting . again , if evidence for @xmath137 is seen at the next generation of neutrino experiments , a neutrino factory could provide much better precision on this angle , as well as a guaranteed measurement of the sign of the largest mass splitting . if @xmath66 is not seen at the next generation of experiments , then neutrino factories have extremely good reach in this angle , since the subleading contributions due to the solar neutrino oscillations would not contribute significantly to the probability .",
    "it is clear that regardless of the outcomes of the next generation of neutrino experiments , a neutrino factory would provide a laboratory to extend our understanding of the lepton mixing sector .",
    "the fact that both the @xmath93 and @xmath138 rates are so high , and the backgrounds in both beams are so low allow huge leaps in measurement precision .",
    "while the lead time to completing the r & d for a neutrino factory is long , the machine itself can be constructed in stages to provide important physics opportunities at each step along the way @xcite . because we do not know where the next big discovery will lie , it is important to pursue the physics accessible at each of these stages .",
    "the stages themselves can be described ( simplifying ) as follows :    1 .",

    "an intense muon source , such as that provided for the front end of a neutrino factory / muon collider , could yield significant improvements in our exploration of muon physics .",
    "the expected intensity of such a source is @xmath139/s , _",
    "i.e. _ , five or six orders of magnitude higher than that presently available .",
    "examples of particle physics programs which might be pursued with intense muon sources are ( 1 ) muon lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) and ( 2 ) muon moments such as the anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath140 ) and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the muon .",
    "the former programs can best be done with low - energy muons ( mostly stopped muons ) , while the latter could be carried out employing in - flight muons in a ring .    at present",
    "it appears that these muon physics programs would benefit significantly from the staging accelerator scenario of a neutrino factory .",
    "the coupling between the physics programs and staging is illustrated in table [ tb : stage ] .",
    "stage i , a proton driver with 14 mw beam power , would yield significant improvements in the lfv and muon moment experiments .",
    "stage ii with a 200mev cooled muon beam would match well to an improved muon edm experiment . because the beam repetition rate of such a source is low",
    ", however , new ideas on how to handle high instantaneous rates would be necessary to utilize stage ii for lfv .",

    "for instance , in supergravity - mediated susy models , radiative corrections in the renormalization group evolution from the gut scale to the weak - energy scale lead to finite mixing in the slepton mass matrix , even when it is assumed to be diagonal at the planck scale .",

    "suggested for stage i to be a source for these experiments , slow beam extraction with a high duty factor would be needed . on the other hand since process ( a ) is based on single particle detection it does not suffer from accidental backgrounds , and therefore is the best suited for high rate muon beams .    in what follows",
    "we discuss several experiments presented at the snowmass conference .",
    "a detector for @xmath141 has to have good energy and position resolutions as well as timing resolution for @xmath155 and @xmath156 . a new experiment to aim at a sensitivity of @xmath157 at psi",

    "the single rate of detector chambers is as high as 500khz .        what would be possible upgrades once an intense proton driver and the front end of neutrino factory are available ?",
    "the meco detector is optimized for the current bnl - ags beam rate .",
    "if an intense proton driver ( of 1 - 4mw ) were available , further detector optimization would be needed to reduce the singles rates , but such optimization is feasible . at stage",
    "ii it would be advantageous to use a cooled muon beam with a smaller energy spread and smaller beam size .",
    "however , the low repetition rate ( a few tens of hz ) would be a drawback .",
    "perhaps a smart detector system might be developed to handle the high instantaneous rates .    in japan",
    ", a dedicated facility called prism ( = phase rotated intense slow muons ) is being considered for the jhf .",
    "it employs phase rotation to reduce the beam energy spread , and has a long flight path in a fixed - field - alternating - gradient synchrotron ring ( ffag ) to remove the surviving pion contamination in the muon beam .",

    "if such new physics originates from susy , it may also give rise to muon lfv ; non - standard model @xmath140 is sensitive to the diagonal matrix elements of the slepton mass matrix , while lfv senses the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "now that @xmath140 has been measured to the parts per million ( ppm ) level an improved understanding of systematic uncertainties in this type of measurement is available . it is anticipated that in a new experiment the the basic technique would not change : a weak focusing storage ring operating at 3.1 gev , with electrostatic quadrupoles providing vertical focusing , and electrons from decaying stored muons being observed . a more uniform magnetic field , smaller storage aperture , and better magnetometer and beam inflector , along with the reduced phase space and more intense beam provided by a stage iii cooled muon beam , could provide a significantly improved measurement . increased polarization with a small sacrifice in intensity",
    "is an added benefit .",
    "all of the above improvements would serve to provide a more precise measurement with smaller systematic uncertainty .    on the theoretical side , more precise experimental measurements of hadron production from @xmath167 collisions at low energies and",
    "@xmath82 lepton decays coupled with better lattice calculations could reduce uncertainties in @xmath140 due to the hadronic contribution .",

    "the neutrino dis events with @xmath213 gev@xmath10 and for @xmath214 as well as @xmath215 are largely unused because of these effects .    with the high statistics foreseen at a superbeam or a neutrino factory , allowing the use of light targets , as well as the special attention to minimizing neutrino beam systematics necessary for neutrino oscillation experiments",
    ", it should be possible for the first time to determine the separate structure functions @xmath216,@xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 where n is an isoscalar target . in leading order qcd ( used for illustrative purposes )",
    "these four structure functions are related to the parton distribution functions by :    @xmath220    note that taking differences and sums of these structure functions would then allow extraction of individual parton distribution functions in a given @xmath221 bin :    @xmath222 + [ \\bar c(x ) - c(x ) ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as we increase the order of qcd and allow gluons into consideration we need to bring in global fitting techniques into the extraction of the parton distribution functions .",
    "however , if the statistical and systematic errors can be kept manageable , the ability to isolate individual parton distribution functions will be dramatically increased by measuring the full set of separate @xmath93 and @xmath223 structure functions .",
    "there is considerable interesting physics in the region of high @xmath224 .",
    "this region can be described as the `` bridge '' between perturbative qcd and non - perturbative qcd , a bridge that lattice gauge theory is trying to construct .",
    "this is a region that requires much additional study with both electroproduction and the weak current of neutrino nucleon interactions .    in global fits of experimental data to extract the parton distribution functions , the functions  even the gluon distribution  are fairly well known from very small @xmath224 up to @xmath224 of around 0.5 . above this value",
    "there is very little data and , in particular , all neutrino data in the region is on heavy nuclear targets and subject to strong nuclear effect which have never been measured .",
    "a high statistics neutrino / antineutrino exposure in @xmath225 and @xmath226 provides the most direct way of studying this rich region of phase space .",
    "the uncertainties at high @xmath224 in current nucleon parton distribution functions are of two types : the ratio of the light quark pdf s , @xmath227 , as @xmath228 and the role of leading power corrections ( higher twist ) in the extraction of the high @xmath224 behavior of the quarks .",
    "these higher twist ( or power suppressed ) corrections represent a long - standing hurdle to making accurate theoretical predictions for structure function data over the full kinematic range .",
    "higher twist corrections should not simply be avoided ; accurate characterization of higher twist corrections provides new information on parton - parton correlations within the nucleus .",
    "the kinematic limits where considerations of higher twist contributions become important are 1 ) at high - x , and 2 ) at low @xmath189 where terms of order @xmath229 become significant . in the high - x region , the limiting factor is primarily statistics . in the low @xmath189 region",
    "the statistics are generally adequate , but if the data is taken on heavy targets the higher twist effects are entangled with nuclear effects .",
    "consequently , the ideal testing ground would be to have high statistics measurements on a light target .",
    "this would allow systematic separation of the higher twist effects from the nuclear effects , and better allow us to learn about both in the process .",
    "another challenge of high - x physics is the long - standing problem in qcd  the calculation of the cross section for the production of heavy quarks both in hadroproduction and leptoproduction mode . in the case of the b - quark ,",
    "for example , there are large discrepancies between data and theory both at the tevatron and at hera facilities .",
    "another unsettling aspect of heavy quark production is the relatively large theoretical uncertainty remaining in the calculations , despite the existence of next - to - leading order calculations .",
    "one degree of freedom that has not been fully studied or exploited in this area is the issue of an  intrinsic \" heavy quark component .",
    "while the question of intrinsic heavy quarks has been discussed in the literature for many years , it still remains unresolved : a definitive experiment is needed ! a particularly incisive test of this theory would be to make precise measurements of heavy quark production in the threshold region . in this kinematic regime ,",
    "the usual  perturbative \" heavy quark component arising from gluon splitting ( @xmath230 ) is comparatively small ; therefore a measurement in this region has more discriminating power to confirm or refute the ",
    "intrinsic \" heavy quark component once and for all .",
    "experiments studying heavy quark production would occur at the 20 - 50gev neutrino factory ( stage iv ) .      a number of proposed projects that use a high - luminosity proton driver to generate a neutrino beam for oscillation physics could add a light mass detector for the purpose of studying low-@xmath189 neutrino dis .",
    "conceptually , the type of detector that would be required would be one which has excellent hadronic and muon energy and angle resolution as well as particle identification . due to the considerable resonance contribution to the neutrino cross section at low energies , particle i d",
    "is required for identification of resonance events .",
    "examples of low - mass detectors which have the required particle i d are liquid - he or liquid - h@xmath231 time projection chambers .",
    "the information acquired from these chambers is very similar to that of bubble chambers .",
    "these detectors feature excellent particle identification and good momentum and energy resolution .      a lepton flavor violation program involving _ neutrinos _ rather than muons would nicely complement the muon physics and neutrino oscillation physics programs at a staged neutrino factory .",
    "several signatures could be looked for in a neutrino experiment with a short enough baseline so that oscillations can be neglected .",
    "for example , in the case of neutrino production from @xmath126 decays , the detection of wrong sign muons , positrons , taus of both signs would all signal new physics in the decay or in the neutrino interaction in the detector . in particular , @xmath127 could arise from the standard cc interaction of muon neutrinos from the flavor violating decay @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) , as well as form the non - standard @xmath114 interaction @xmath234 or the non - standard @xmath1 interactions @xmath235 , @xmath236 .",
    "analogously , positrons could be produced in the standard cc interactions of electron antineutrinos from @xmath237 or from the process @xmath238 in the detector . in each case , observation would immediately point to new physics well beyond the implications of the standard model .",
    "particularly interesting from the experimental point of view is the wrong sign muon signature . by using a @xmath239 baseline , a muon energy of 2gev ( stage iii ) , and a 10 ton detector ,",
    "the sensitivity on the branching ratios @xmath240 and @xmath241 is improved by two orders of magnitude below current values , which only extend to the @xmath242 level  @xcite .    in the case of higher neutrino energies ,",
    "it is possible for neutrino detectors to be sensitive to additional lepton family violating channels .",
    "specifically , for neutrino energies above 10.7 gev ( stage iv ) , one can be sensitive to the reaction @xmath243 .",
    "such an interaction is both sensitive to new physics , such as left - right symmetry and dileptons , and has the very clean wrong sign muon signature .",
    "in addition , because the target is an electron , the muon emanating from the reaction will have very small opening angle ( @xmath244 ) , which can be used as an additional handle to distinguish events from standard model and non - standard model background .",
    "this possibility has also been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the same detectors as outlined in silicon ccd or liquid methane tpc detectors can be used which provide excellent charge , vertex , and angular resolution  @xcite .",
    "projected sensitivities at stage iv would improve over current limits by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude and , if backgrounds can remain under control , reach the @xmath245 or @xmath180 level .",
    "the scale of new physics that can be probed with such a sensitivity depends on the specific model one considers . however , the cleanliness of the experimental signature and its complementarity to neutrino oscillation experiments makes lepton flavor violation searches an attractive feature of a stage iv neutrino factory program .",
    "although muon colliders were discussed at snowmass 96 as energy frontier machines , much has been learned in the meantime about what physics could be achieved on the way to such a device .",
    "the experiments described in this document have so far borne little resemblance to the experiments that were proposed at the previous snowmass workshop . in this last section",
    "we describe the motivation for using a muon collider as a higgs factory ( i.e. , still much lower in energy that was originally proposed ) , what physics it could provide , and what some of the detector concerns are for this experiment .      at a muon collider  @xcite the higgs boson",
    "would be produced through the @xmath246-channel , so the production cross section is thousands of times larger than the cross section at an @xmath246-channel @xmath167 collider . because a muon beam energy spread as small as @xmath247 may be possible , there is a possibility of measuring  to a few hundred kev and a direct measurement of the width to about 1 mev . if only one light higgs boson were observed , it would be crucial to measure its properties to infer whether it is a standard model or supersymmetric higgs .",
    "the @xmath21 properties of the higgs bosons can be measured through asymmetries with transversely polarized @xmath126 and @xmath127 beams  @xcite . in the case of heavy mssm higgs bosons , the large coupling to @xmath248 may be necessary for their direct observation .",
    "although the higgs boson mass must be known to a few per cent @xcite before knowing at what energy to build a muon collider as a higgs factory , it is believed that that mass is low .",
    "once a beam of 50gev muons can be collected and stored in a ring to do neutrino experiments , the remaining task to get to a higgs factory would be mostly an issue of beam cooling , since the center of mass energy of two 50gev muon beams is expected to be relatively close to the higgs mass .    in order to measure the width of a narrow ( 2 - 3 mev ) higgs boson of mass (  120gev )",
    ", one needs to have beam energy spread and stability of order @xmath249 and also to measure the energy of the bunches to @xmath245 .",
    "the latter measurement is feasible using @xmath140 spin precession of the muons by measuring @xcite the energy spectrum of the decay electrons turn by turn .",
    "indirect information about the mass of the standard model higgs boson can be obtained from fits to the precision electroweak data taken at the @xmath250 resonance at lep and the slc , and from neutrino - nucleon deep inelastic scattering cross section measurements .",
    "the z - pole cross sections and asymmetries are sensitive to the mass of the top quark , the mass of the @xmath251 boson , the qcd coupling constant @xmath252 .",
    "most electroweak observables are sensitive to the log of the mass of the higgs boson   through radiative corrections .",
    "the electroweak data fit gives  @xcite  = 88@xmath253 gev and @xmath254 196 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "although electroweak fits suggest a light higgs , searches thus far have produced only lower bounds on the mass . at lep the sm higgs boson is expected to be produced mainly through the higgs - strahlung process @xmath255 , with contributions from the @xmath256 fusion channel below 10% .",
    "the lower bound coming from a combined analysis of the four lep experiments is @xmath257 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "( 115.4 gev expected ) .",
    "the hints for a higgs boson with a low mass and the disagreement of @xmath258 with the standard model expectation @xcite are consistent with the following general scenario  @xcite :    * in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath259 gev indicates a large value of @xmath260 . *",
    "the disagreement of @xmath258 also indicates a large value of @xmath260 . *",
    "if the disagreement of @xmath258 is explained by supersymmetry , then the sign of the supersymmetry parameter @xmath187 is consistent with @xmath261 . * in the decoupling limit , the lighter higgs boson @xmath262 has couplings like the standard model higgs , but the heavier higgs bosons @xmath263",
    ", @xmath264 have non - standard model couplings : their coupling to gauge bosons is greatly suppressed . * for larger values of @xmath260 ,",
    "there is a range of heavy higgs boson masses for which discovery is not possible at the lhc or an @xmath167 linear collider . * in the mssm , the heavy higgs bosons are largely degenerate , especially in the decoupling limit .",
    "very precise center - of - mass energy resolution will be needed to separate them .",
    "figure  [ geant ] shows a trial muon collider detector for a higgs factory simulated in geant .",
    "the background from muon decay sources has been extensively studied  @xcite . at the higgs factory ,",
    "the main sources of background are from photons generated by the showering of muon decay electrons . at the higher energy colliders ,",
