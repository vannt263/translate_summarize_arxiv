    "such regulation of gene expression is executed by the concerted action of transcription factors ( tfs ) that bind to specific regulatory dna sequences associated with target genes  @xcite . deciphering the roles of tfs",
    "is a significant challenge and has been the focus of numerous studies , with great interest being recently shown in cancer  @xcite .",
    "for example , bar - joseph _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified periodically expressed cell - cycle genes in human foreskin fibroblasts to understand their differential regulation between normal and cancer conditions .",

    "darnell  @xcite classified tfs having cancerous or oncogenic potential into three main kinds  steroid receptors ( _ e.g. _ oestrogen receptors in breast cancer and androgen receptors in prostate cancer ) , resident nuclear proteins activated by serine kinase cascades ( _ e.g. _ jun and fos ) , and latent cytoplasmic factors normally activated by receptor - ligand interaction at the cell surface ( _ e.g. _ stats and nf@xmath0b ) .",
    "darnell  @xcite also discussed the signalling pathways of these tfs ( including wnt-@xmath1-catenin , notch and hedgehog signalling ) as potential drug targets in cancer .",

    "analysis for two pancreatic - tissue conditions _ viz _ normal and ductal adenocarcinoma ( pdac ) tumour revealed significant changes in co - expression for these complexes between the two conditions .",

    "these observations also suggest that differential expression is not sensitive enough to identify all the genes ( here , tfs ) involved in tumours .",
    "many of the tfs may not be differentially expressed themselves , but are differentially _ co - expressed _ with their target genes .",
    "one such possible situation occurs when the tfs themselves are not mutated or ( epigenetically ) silenced , but their target genes are .",
    "finally , @xmath40 of @xmath41 tfs in pancreatic , and @xmath42 of @xmath43 tfs in breast tumours were among the @xmath44 cancer tfs listed in  @xcite .",

    "given this combinatorial regulation model , our purpose is to compute the influence coefficients @xmath90 @xmath91 by solving equation  [ eq : infl3 ] , and for this we employ singular - value decomposition ( svd ) arriving at a least - squares solution  @xcite .",
    "the tf displaying the highest ( absolute ) coefficient @xmath92 has the highest overall influence in regulating changes in co - expression of complexes .",
    "solving the equation can give positive as well as negative @xmath35 values . the absolute value @xmath92 indicates the magnitude of the influence , while the sign indicates the direction : tfs of the same sign regulating a set of complexes work _ cooperatively _ , while those of opposite signs work _ counteractively _ with each other . to understand this consider the following simplified example in which two tfs with influences @xmath93 and @xmath94 regulate two complexes @xmath95 and @xmath96 as per the following set of equations : @xmath97 which after taking @xmath98 becomes , @xmath99 here we see that the second tf performs at least twice the regulation than the first tf on the two complexes ( 5 and 6 _ vs _ 10 and 20 ) , the regulation by the second tf is doubled ( from 10 to 20 ) as against a smaller increase for the first tf ( from 5 to 6 ) between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and yet @xmath95 and @xmath96 show roughly the same change in co - expression ( 0.50 _ vs _ 0.60 ) .",
    "this intuitively means that the first tf has a greater influence than the second tf , and that counteracts the second tf to maintain the co - expression of complexes similar . indeed upon solving the equations we get @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which is interpreted as the first tf being about twice as influential as the second , with the two tfs working counteractively in regulating @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
