    "the french crystallographer george friedel was able to explain why , within the kinematical approximation , the zeroth order laue zone in x - ray diffraction patterns , always are centrosymmetric and showed how this puts restrictions on the possible crystal symmetries that can be directly determined by x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "not only does fl apply to x - ray diffraction on crystals , it generally is valid for all scattering processes where a plane wave scatters on ( approximately ) two dimensional objects that are described by a real transmittance function , such as apertures or gratings .",
    "whereas for electron diffraction on crystals , fl breaks down relatively fast because of dynamical scattering , it remains valid for electrons scattered on apertures . since fl only is valid for plane waves , the diffraction patterns of distorted or modified beams , like the so - called vortex beams , do not necessarily follow this rule .",
    "vortex beams are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) operator , @xmath2 @xcite and their wavefunction has the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the radial and the azimuthal coordinate with respect to the wave propagation axis , @xmath6 .",
    "the number @xmath7 , is called the topological charge ( tc ) of the vortex . since",
    "vortex beams are a eigenstates of the angular momentum operator , they possess a well - defined angular momentum of @xmath8 per photon@xcite , electron@xcite or any other particle@xcite described by the wave function in eq .",
    "[ eq : vortex ] .",
    "these beams have a typical donut - like intensity profile , a bright ring with a black spot in the middle , that arises from the phase singularity at its center . since their first experimental demonstration in optics @xcite , they have been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally , which has led to numerous applications in fields such as nano - manipulation @xcite , astrophysics @xcite and telecommunications @xcite .",
    "although slightly more complicated , a vast amount of methods have been developed to produce vortex beams in an electron microscope @xcite as well and several studies suggest their use to probe magnetism @xcite , nano - manipulation @xcite , spin - polarization devices @xcite and measuring the chirality of crystals @xcite . additionally , the expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : vortex ] provides an excellent mathematical basis to describe scattering on helical crystals @xcite or processes involving local exchange of oam@xcite .",
    "many of the above applications , require an accurate measurement of the tc of the vortex beam .",
    "a popular way of doing this , is by studying the vortex diffraction patterns of specially designed apertures such as triangular apertures @xcite or multi - pinhole plates @xcite . in this work we elaborate on the observation made in these studies that diffraction patterns of vortex beams with opposite tc always seem to be centrosymmetric or equivalently ,",
    "rotated @xmath9  rad , with respect to each other , independent from the shape of the aperture .",
    "although in the above research , this can be explained using the symmetry of these specific apertures , we will formulate an extension of fl as a more fundamental property of vortex beam diffraction .",
    "we illustrate with numerical simulations and experiments , that even for non - symmetric scattering processes , the two - fold rotational symmetry between diffraction patterns with oppositely charged vortex beams , remains present .",
    "this research provides further insights in vortex beam diffraction and can help to optimize methods to measure the tc of vortex beams using diffraction gratings or study general vortex beam diffraction .",
    "friedel s law ( fl ) includes two properties of the fourier transform ( ft ) of real functions@xcite .",

    "friedel applied these properties to describe the symmetries seen in x - ray diffraction patterns on crystals . for a scalar plane wave photon , that is scattered kinematically by a crysal ,",
    "the scattering potential is a real function . within the single scattering approximation , valid for weakly interacting samples , the scattering amplitude of a plane wave photon , with wavenumber @xmath17 , to scatter to a plane wave with wavenumber @xmath18 ,",
    "then is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , the scattering amplitude exactly equals the ft of the potential .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern is given by the intersection of the three dimensional scattering amplitude with the so - called ewald sphere , which assures that the length of the wave vector of the outgoing photon , and thus the energy , is the same as that of the incoming photon @xcite .",
    "in general , the curvature of this sphere can be considered flat for any relevant scattering angle , and the scattering amplitude is determined by the two dimensional ft of the potential projected along the @xmath6-axis , the photon s propagation axis , @xmath21 , @xmath22 where here , and in the following , @xmath23 denotes the two dimensional coordinate in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the diffraction patterns in the kinematical approximation , given by the scattering amplitude squared @xmath25 , will be centrosymmetric because of fl , making it impossible to distinguish certain symmetries in the projection of crystals with one single diffraction pattern . a crystal with a three - fold rotation axis along the projection direction , for instance ,",
    "will show the same symmetry in its diffraction pattern as a crystal with a six - fold rotation axis @xcite .",
    "besides x - ray diffraction on crystals , fl also applies to diffraction of plane waves on apertures and gratings .",
    "consider , for instance , an aperture in the @xmath26-plane that is placed at @xmath27 , illuminated by a plane wave of the form @xmath28 . the diffracted wave in the far  field of the aperture then is given by the fraunhofer equation @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath6 te distance from the aperture and @xmath31 the transmittance function of the grating .",
    "in general @xmath32 does not have to be real . in case of phase plates , for instance , where the phase of the wave is altered , @xmath32 is complex .",
    "but for apertures that only change the amplitude , @xmath32 is real . in this case",
    "it is clear we can apply friedel s law and the intensity pattern of the diffracted wave will always be centrosymmetric , independently from the symmetry of the diffraction grating .",
    "this is shown numerically and experamentally in fig .",
    "[ fig : intcenter ] .",
    "friedel s law only applies to diffraction of plane waves .",

    "[ eq : scattamp ] by a vortex beam .",

[ vortexbeam ] reflects the experimental setup of a vortex beam that is generated by evenly illuminating the condenser aperture while giving it an extra vortex phase , after which the probe is formed in the far  field of this aperture . for photons , this phase can be applied with , for instance , a spatial light modulator @xcite , while for electrons , this can be realized by placing the tip of a magnetized needle on the center of the condenser aperture @xcite . in our experiment , however , the electron vortex beams are created by placing a fork hologram in the illumination system @xcite .",

    "[ fig : intcenter ] , the real space image of a vortex beam with @xmath55 , @xmath43 and @xmath56 centered on a multi - pinhole aperture that consists out of five equidistant holes , is shown together with the simulated and experimental diffraction pattern .",
    "because of the five - fold symmetry of the aperture and the central position of the probe , the diffraction patterns all show five - fold symmetry .",
    "also , because of friedel s law , the @xmath43 beam shows extra two - fold rotation symmetry and the resulting diffraction pattern becomes ten - fold symmetric .",
    "this symmetry is absent in the vortex beam diffraction patterns . however , following eq .",
    "[ eq : friedelvortex ] , a two - fold rotation symmetry can be observed between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 diffraction patterns .",
    "the same can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tricenter ] , where a @xmath55 and an @xmath56 vortex are centered on a triangular aperture .",
    "because of the three - fold symmetry of the aperture and the central probe position , both diffraction patterns show three - fold symmetry .",
    "again , the two diffraction patterns are rotated @xmath9  rad with respect to each other .    in both examples ,",
    "the vortex is centered on a high - symmetry point of the aperture , which makes that the symmetry of the aperture is retained in all diffraction patterns .",
    "this makes that the two - fold rotational relation between the opposite vortex diffraction patterns , is equivalent with a mirror operation or a rotation over @xmath57 and @xmath58  rad for the five - fold and three - fold symmetric aperture respectively . to show that the two - fold rotation is independent from the symmetry of the beam position and symmetry of the aperture , in fig .",
    "[ fig : trioffcenter ] , we shift the vortex beam to a non symmetric position on the triangular aperture , thereby destroying the three - fold symmetry .",
    "however , the two - fold rotation relation between diffraction patterns of the opposite vortex beams , remains present as expected .",
    "the efl in eq . [",
    "eq : friedelvortex ] shows that diffraction patterns of oppositely charged vortices always are two - fold symmetric with respect to each other when scattered on a real two - dimensional projected potential or two - dimensional apertures with real transmittance functions .",
    "the triangular aperture we used , fig .",
    "( [ fig : tricenter ] ) already was suggested to determine the topological charge of a vortex beam by hickmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . by looking at the diffraction pattern",
    ", they were able to derive a rule for determining the magnitude of oam of the incoming beam and they noted that diffraction patterns of opposite charge always were rotated by @xmath9  rad .",
    "similarly , the pinhole aperture was proposed by berkhout _",
    "@xcite as an alternative method to measure the topological charge of vortex beams .",
    "they also mention that , in the case of an odd number of holes , the diffraction pattern of opposite charge are mirrored to one another .",
    "several other diffraction experiments with vortices were performed @xcite and , when a comparison with oppositely charged vortices was made , the same centrosymmetry between diffraction patterns always was observed .    ) but now the axis of the vortex lies on a non symmetric point of the aperture . therefore the diffraction patterns no longer show the symmetry of the aperture .",
    "however , consistent with eq .",
    "[ eq : friedelvortex ] , the @xmath55 and @xmath54 diffraction patterns are rotated @xmath9  rad with respect to one another .",
    "this shows that this effect is not dependent on the symmetry of the scattering object , but is a more fundamental effect of vortex scattering.[fig : trioffcenter ] ]    in all these examples , however , the arguments to explain the symmetry between two opposite vortex beam diffraction patterns , relied on the symmetry of the specific apertures with respect to the center of the vortex ( the studies on asymmetric apertures we found , unfortunately , do not compare opposite vortex beam diffraction patterns ) .",
    "the efl , however , shows that this symmetry is a fundamental property of vortex beams scattered on any real , projected potential or two - dimensional apertures with real transmittance functions , independent from the symmetry of the scattering object .    like friedel s law",
    ", efl is useful when studying crystallography with vortex beams . in previous work ,",
    "for example , we proposed the use of electron vortex beam diffraction to determine the handedness of chiral crystals @xcite , crystals that only differ by a mirror operation , starting from the idea that vortex beams themselves are chiral . however , by extending friedel s law to vortex beams",
    ", it immediately becomes clear that the chirality can - not be learned directly from the projected potential of the crystal or the zeroth order laue zone ( zolz ) in the diffraction pattern , within the kinematical approximation .",
    "any chiral effect that would be seen with one vortex , would only differ by a rotation of @xmath9  rad , with the opposite vortex .",
    "therefor the left - handed crystal would show the same zolz as its right - handed mirror image when rotated @xmath9  rad along the beam s propagation direction .",
    "looking at kinematically scattered electrons , any chiral effect must thus be searched for in the higher order laue zones that contain three dimensional information about the crystal vortex beam is rotated @xmath9  rad with respect to the @xmath59 vortex , when , at the same time , the potential is mirrored along the plane perpendicular to the propagation of the vortex beam . ] .",
    "in this work , we derived an extension of friedel s law ( efl ) that applies to vortex beams , whether it concerns an optical , electron or any other particle beam . we show that when a vortex beam is diffracted on a two - dimensional scattering object , such as apertures , two diffraction patterns of vortex beams with opposite topological charge , always are rotated @xmath9  rad with respect to each other .",
    "this is independent from the symmetry of the scattering object and a fundamental property of vortex beam scattering .",
    "our findings also apply for diffraction on a crystal , when kinematical scattering between the zeroth order laue zone is considered . in general , this can be applied to x - ray , but not for electron diffraction on crystals , which is mostly dominated by dynamical scattering .",
    "we verified our analytical derivation with numerical simulations and showed experimental results for electron vortex beams scattered on a multi - pinhole and triangular aperture .",
    "we compared our findings with observations made in literature , where this effect mostly is explained using the symmetry of the scattering objects with respect to the center of the vortex beam .",
    "however , with our derivation and by looking at vortex beams scattering on non - symmetric points of our apertures , we ve shown that this symmetry is a more fundamental property of vortex beam diffraction .",
