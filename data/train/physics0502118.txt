    "the game theory is considered to be mathematical formulation of theory of conflicts @xcite . since its initialization by von neumann and morgenstern in 1946 @xcite , it becomes a powerful branch of knowledge , with numerous links to other areas of science .",
    "offering new insight into old problems , these links allow to widen our perspective to new interdisciplinary applications .",
    "such is the concept of self - organizing hierarchies in animal societies , introduced by bonabeau _",
    "et al . _ in 1995 @xcite ( see refs . @xcite for the most recent results and ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . in the bonabeau model ,",
    "@xmath3 agents walk randomly on a given area and fight when they met .",
    "initially , the outcome of fights is random .",
    "however , agents are able to remember for some time their past results and this memory influences their subsequent fights",
    ". then , there are two competitive mechanisms .",
    "first , each fight influences the agents power : winner is stronger and looser is weaker , what alters the probabilities of winning of their future fights .",
    "second , the information of these alterations is gradually erased . as a consequence , a phase transition can be observed : for a given velocity of forgetting , frequent fights produce a hierarchy of permanent winners and permanent loosers .",
    "this hierarchy is maintained in time .",
    "however , if fights are rare , the hierarchy is being forgotten quicker , than it is reproduced .",
    "the frequency of fights depends on the number of fighters on a given area .",
    "the order parameter is the dispersion of power of the agents , or the dispersion of probabilities of winning / loosing of pairs of agents .",
    "the phase transition was termed in @xcite as the one between hierarchical and egalitarian society . besides its sociological associations",
    ", the bonabeau model offers nontrivial dynamics of a specific , time - dependent spontaneous symmetry breaking , which  in our opinion  deserves attention from a theoretical point of view .",
    "unfortunately , numerical experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the order and even the appearance of the phase transition depends on a direct way of forgetting , i.e. the time dependence of the agents power , and on the presence of mean - field - like coupling which is absent in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a reasonable strategy of resolving this puzzle seems to separate it to elements as simple as possible , and to observe their properties .",
    "here we propose a formulation where the spatial coordinates of agents are absent .",
    "instead , the agents are placed at nodes of a fully connected graph , i.e. each agent can meet every other agent .",
    "scale free networks were mentioned in @xcite . in next section",
    "the applied procedure is described in detail .",
    "numerical results are reported and concluded in two subsequent sections .",
    "two fighters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are selected randomly from a population of @xmath3 agents .",
    "the probability that @xmath4-th agent wins over @xmath5-th is    @xmath6\\ } } \\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the power of @xmath4-th agent at time @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average over @xmath3 agents . as an output of the fight ,",
    "the power @xmath1 of the winner increases by @xmath10 and the one of the looser decreases by @xmath10 .",
    "every @xmath11 steps ( i.e. fights ) , the powers @xmath1 of all agents are multiplied by the factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "this is the step of ` forgetting ' .",
    "as often as forgetting procedure takes place the current value of dispersion @xmath14 is evaluated which is then fixed during next @xmath11 fights .",
    "the number of such updates of @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "then , the total number of fights during one simulation is @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters of the calculations are : the system size @xmath3 , the number of fights @xmath11 between the subsequent updates of @xmath14 , the number of steps @xmath15 and the change @xmath10 of the power @xmath1 .",
    "the initial distribution of @xmath1 appears also to be relevant .",
    "this is set either random ( @xmath17 $ ] ) , or homogeneous , i.e. @xmath18 for all @xmath4 , or delta - like , i.e. @xmath19 for all @xmath4 .",
    "we keep @xmath20 .",
    "the output of the simulation is the critical value of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath14 changes abruptly .",
    "we can speak about ` hierarchical ' ( large @xmath14 ) or ` egalitarian ' ( small @xmath14 ) society . as a rule , for small @xmath0 we get hierarchy , and for large @xmath0  equality .",
    "it appears that @xmath2 depends on the ratio between @xmath3 and @xmath11 . keeping @xmath11 constant and increasing @xmath3 , we make forgetting more and more relevant , because each agent fights less between subsequent forgettings",
    ". then , the critical value @xmath2 decreases with @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a )",
    ". we can compensate this variation , changing @xmath11 and @xmath3 simultaneously as to keep @xmath2 constant .",
    "two series of this procedure are shown in figs . [ fig-1](b ) and [ fig-1](c ) , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] , we show two respective curves of @xmath11 against @xmath3 .     for ( a ) fixed @xmath23 and different values of @xmath3 and with tuned values of @xmath11 for @xmath3-independent values of @xmath2 : ( b ) @xmath21 , ( c ) @xmath22.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for ( a ) fixed @xmath23 and different values of @xmath3 and with tuned values of @xmath11 for @xmath3-independent values of @xmath2 : ( b ) @xmath21 , ( c ) @xmath22.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for ( a ) fixed @xmath23 and different values of @xmath3 and with tuned values of @xmath11 for @xmath3-independent values of @xmath2 : ( b ) @xmath21 , ( c ) @xmath22.,title=\"fig : \" ]     for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "linear fits are @xmath24 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath21 ) . ]",
    "we note that the obtained values of @xmath14 are stable vs time , because the distribution of the agent s power @xmath1 stabilize after some transient time .",
    "examples of this dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] for various values of the parameters .    .",
    "between subsequent @xmath14 evaluations @xmath11 fights take place . ]",
    "according to what was said above , the system size of the critical value of forgetting parameter @xmath26 decreases to zero for large @xmath3 .",
    "the character of this variation is shown in fig .",

    "in their seminal paper @xcite , the authors put several examples and suggestions on societies , which could self - organize into the hierarchical state . there , reference are given on animal societies , like bees , wasps , ants , chickens , cows and ponies .",
    "a question arises how important are spatial degrees of freedom in these societies .",
    "this is a central task for our considerations , because the territorial aspect of the problem of hierarchy is disregarded here , while it was included in earlier work .",
    "it seems that in small groups of some animals , the difference in hierarchy is not to be here or there but rather to do this or that .",
    "this is particularly true in societies of some primates , as _ pan troglodytes _ , _ homo sapiens _ or _ gorilla gorilla _ @xcite .",
    "the bonabeau model , once released , lives with its own life as it provides nontrivial questions on its mathematical properties . however , its core is the sociological application : description of a group of agents , possibly human , which concentrate on their hierarchy .",
    "such hierarchy appears in a natural way in sports competitions . for example",
    ", each football league in the world produces one table at the end of the season with the numbers of points and goals for each team . usually , the extremes at the top and the bottom have widely spaces points , while in the center the average teams differ just by one point .",
    "this is not dissimilar to the power distribution of the bonabeau model @xcite .",
    "how important is the hierarchy for the agents , depends on their experience and social environment . except army and some universities , we are interested in formation of a society rather egalitarian than hierarchical , and tasks of educational organizations following this attitude",
