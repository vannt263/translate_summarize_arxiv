    "it is not unreasonable that internal dimensions of planckian size can play a rle in the early stages of the life of the universe @xcite .",
    "the question is then how internal dimensions became so small in comparison with the external ( expanding ) dimensions . in the last twenty years various sorts of cosmological compactifications",
    "have been proposed @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these mechanisms invoke , in some way or in another , a long phase during which the scale factor of the internal manifold shrinks until it stabilizes to the wanted planckian value .",
    "there are at least three independent problems associated with a mechanism of cosmological conpactification :    * the nature of the sources driving the contraction of the internal dimensions ; * the nature of the mechanism stabilizing the radius of the internal manifold ; * the properties of the inhomogeneities induced by the process of compactification .",
    "even higher - dimensional einstein equations allow for vacuum solutions of kasner type . these solutions may well describe the contraction of the internal dimensions .",
    "the caveat with such a simple realization of cosmological compactification is the possible occurrence of physical singularities both in the external and internal manifold , as repeatedly noticed in connection with string cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the properties of metric perturbations induced by a phase of compactification , have been partially discussed by various authors .",
    "in particular , the bardeen formalism @xcite has been generalized to the case of anisotropic manifolds @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution equations for the bardeen potentials have been solved in a number of explicit examples @xcite .",
    "canonical normal modes of the fluctuations have been obtained in specific classes of anisotropic manifolds @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to argue that the contraction of the internal manifold is not a sufficient condition for the perturbative treatment of the curvature inhomogeneities induced by the process of compactification . in the purely four - dimensional case ,",
    "curvature fluctuations are conserved over wavelengths larger than the hubble radius in a number of relevant cases like , for instance , the one where a single scalar field sources the dynamics of the background geometry .",
    "if internal dimensions are present , their fluctuations will necessarily induce a term analog to the non - adiabatic pressure density variation .",
    "therefore , curvature fluctuations will no longer be conserved .",
    "this occurrence would not be , by itself , problematic .",
    "however , a problem may arise if the growth of curvature fluctuations is too sharp when the relevant wavelengths are larger than the hubble radius .    to discuss this problem",
    "we will use , as a toy model , the low - energy string effective action typical of pre - big bang models supplemented by a ( non - local ) dilaton potential . within this set - up",
    "is possible to obtain rather reasonable solutions describing the compactification of the internal dimensions and the simultaneous expansion of the external dimensions @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of these solutions is that the external dimensions expands in an accelerated fashion and then decelerate ( but always expand ) .",
    "the transition from acceleration to deceleration is regular in a technical sense .",
    "finally , these solutions can be usefully expressed in analytical terms and this aspect helps an unambiguous analytical treatment of the evolution of the fluctuations of the geometry .",

    ", the salient features of the evolution of the fluctuations of the geometry will be derived .",
    "owing to the large number of scalar degrees of freedom present in higher - dimensional ( anisotropic ) manifolds , the analysis will be then preformed in a five - dimensional geometry . in section 4",
    "the evolution equation of the generalized curvature fluctuations will be presented . moreover",
    ", the evolution equations of the system will be recast in a useful first - order form . in section 5 the issue of quantum - mechanical normalization of the fluctuations will be discussed and quasi - normal modes of the system introduced .",
