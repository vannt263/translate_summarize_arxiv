    "in the standard picture of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , accretion onto a super - massive black hole is via an accretion disk , and a significant fraction of the accretion power ( possibly supplemented by tapping into the rotational energy of the black hole ) produces twin opposing relativistic jets moving outward along the disk axis , with typical lorentz factors @xmath310 as inferred from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations .",
    "the objects observed in high energy @xmath4 rays are `` blazars '' , agn in which one of the jets is closely aligned toward the observer .",
    "it is natural that in @xmath4-rays we should see preferentially those agn with aligned jets because the emission from the jet is doppler boosted in energy and relativistically beamed along the jet direction ( for a discussion of relativistic effects see urry and padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 ray emission from blazars is variable ( as it is also at optical , uv and x - ray energies ) .",
    "relativistic effects also cause the observed variability time to be shorter than the time scale over which the emission changes in the jet frame .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two broad peaks , the low energy peak extending from the infrared to the uv or x - ray region of the spectrum , and the high energy peak starting in the x - ray or @xmath4 ray range .",
    "the usual interpretation is that relativistic electrons produce the low energy part by synchrotron emission , and that the same electrons produce the high energy part by compton scattering the low energy part and/or external photons to higher energies .",
    "the 3rd egret catalog of high - energy @xmath4-ray sources ( hartman et al.1999 ) contains around 70 high confidence identifications of agn , and all appear to be blazars ( montigny et al .",
    "1995 , mukherjee et al .",
    "clearly , the @xmath4-ray emission is associated with agn jets .",
    "four bl lac objects have been detected in the tev energy range : mrk  421 ( punch et al .",
    "1992 ) , mrk  501 ( quinn et al .",
    "1996 ) , 1e  s2344 + 514 ( catanese et al .",
    "1998 ) and pks  2155 - 304 ( chadwick et al .  1999 ) .",
    "recently , the spectrum of mrk 501 has been measured up to 24 tev by the hegra telescopes ( konopelko et al.1999 ) .",
    "several of the egret agn show @xmath4-ray variability with time scales of @xmath5 day ( kniffen et al .",
    "1993 ) at gev energies .",
    "the tev @xmath4-ray emission of two bl lacs shows very rapid variability .",
    "for mrk 421 , variability on a time scale as short as @xmath6 minutes has been reported ( gaidos et al.1996 ) . in the case of mrk 501 ,",
    "variability on a time scale of a few hours was observed during the 1997 high level of activity , and there is evidence of a 23 day periodicity ( protheroe et al.1998 , hayashida et al .",
    "1998 ) interpreted in terms of a binary black hole model for the central engine by rieger and mannheim ( 2000 ) .",
    "these variability timescales place important constraints on the models .",
    "for example , the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model appears to be just consistent with recent multi - wavelength observations of mrk  421 and mrk  501 during flaring activity ( bednarek and protheroe 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "however , the allowed range of physical parameters ( doppler factor and magnetic field ) is rather small , and this mechanism may well be excluded by future observations .",
    "for a recent review of tev @xmath4-ray astronomy see kifune ( 2002 ) .",
    "rapid variability in intra - day variability ( idv ) sources is a long - standing problem as it implies apparent brightness temperatures in the radio regime which may exceed 10@xmath7 k or relativistic beaming with extremely high doppler factors , coherent radiation mechanisms , or special geometric effects ( wagner and witzel 1995 ) .",
    "the very rapid flaring observed at tev and x  ray energies during flaring activity in blazars also presents a challenge for any model and suggests a re - examination of mechanisms which may cause very rapid variability would be worthwhile . in this paper",
    "i concentrate on how the observed variability time is related to the geometry and motion of the emission region , and thus to the photon energy density in the emission region .",
    "the blazar emission mechanisms to be discussed include : a shock excited emission region , bent jets , a shock propagating along a jet containing a helical structure and illuminating parts of the helix by enhanced interactions / emission of radiation such that the emission regions move along helical paths , and highly oblique conical shocks in the jet . together with geometry - specific time delays and variable doppler boosting associated with relativistic motion of the emission region along a curved trajectory , it may well be possible to explain the observed flaring activity and high brightness temperatures .",
    "another possibility briefly discussed in the context of bent jets and conical shocks is that jets may be fueled on an irregular time scale .",
    "the observed variability time @xmath8 , and some assumed or estimated doppler factor @xmath1 is often used to estimate the jet - frame source radius , @xmath9 .",
    "the jet - frame photon energy density is then usually assumed to be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the jet - frame bolometric luminosity given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the observed bolometric flux , and @xmath14 being the luminosity distance .",
    "however , this approach can lead to large systematic errors in the jet - frame photon energy density .",
    "this is important because the energy density of photons of the low energy part of the sed may determine the energy losses of electrons , and the rate of up - scattering to @xmath4-ray energies in ssc models , and the rate of proton - photon collisions in hadronic models ( see , e.g. , mannheim and biermann 1989 , protheroe 1997 , mannheim et al .",
    "2001 , mcke and protheroe 2001 , mcke et al .",
    "if the emission region is optically thin , it may also have consequences for idv sources as i will show that it is quite possible that the photon energy density responsible for the so - called compton catastrophe may actually be lower than usually estimated . in the following sections i shall discuss how the variability time is related to the emission region geometry and intrinsic jet - frame variability , show how this can lead to large systematic errors in the jet - frame photon energy density , and discuss other scenarios which can lead to rapid variability and high fluxes .",
    "i shall discuss first a relativistic jet pointing at angle @xmath15 with respect to the line of sight to the observer , in which the emission region is a cylinder of radius @xmath16 and jet - frame length @xmath17 moving along the jet with the jet s lorentz factor @xmath18 . to work out how the observed lightcurve depends on the emission region geometry and the duration of the emission in the jet frame ( primed coordinates ) we first consider in the observer frame ( unprimed coordinates ) the events corresponding to : ( i ) the emission from centre of cylinder at @xmath19 with this event defining the origin of coordinates in both frames , i.e. @xmath20 ; ( ii ) the emission from some arbitrary point in the cylinder at a later time @xmath21 ; ( iii ) the arrival at the telescope , located in the @xmath22@xmath23 plane , of the photon emitted in event ( i ) ; ( iv ) the arrival at the telescope of the photon emitted in event ( ii ) ( see fig .",

    "the time interval between arrival of the two photons at the telescope is independent of distance to the agn and is simply given by @xmath28 the error made by using this approximation is @xmath29 and is negligible compared with the variability time scale associated with the emission region geometry investigated in this paper which is @xmath30 .",
    "lorentz transformation to the observer frame , gives @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

[ eq : fundamental ] becomes @xmath36    let us suppose that the cylindrical emission region emits radiation simultaneously and uniformly throughout its volume between times @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as measured in the jet frame . while a simultaneous burst violates causality , it is nevertheless a useful case to consider because it enables us to determine clearly the contribution of emission region geometry to the observed variability time .",
    "for @xmath39 the first photon to arrive would have been emitted at @xmath40 giving @xmath41 similarly , the last photon to arrive would have been emitted at @xmath42 giving @xmath43 for @xmath44 the first photon to arrive would have been emitted at @xmath45 , and the last photon to arrive would have been emitted at @xmath46 . hence , if we define the observer frame duration of the burst as @xmath47 then @xmath48 and this is valid for all @xmath49 .",

    "hence , the observer frame duration of the burst is @xmath65 if @xmath49 is small ( @xmath15 is _ very _ small ) , one finds @xmath66 and for a reasonable shock speed , e.g. @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to a reverse shock .",

    "we shall discuss this point further in section  4 .",
    "the monte carlo method allows the accurate calculation of expected light curves for any emission region geometry and intrinsic source variability .",

    "if the lorentz factor of the jet decreases at each shock crossing as assumed here then , because the doppler factor is also reduced at each shock crossing , only the first few conical shocks would be prominent in the lightcurve resulting from a single jet perturbation .",
    "this is shown in fig  [ lc_of_coneshocks](b ) which gives the lightcurve from fig  [ lc_of_coneshocks](a ) for @xmath203 on a linear scale .    as can be seen ,",
    "the lightcurve is quasi - periodic .",
    "it would be strictly periodic if the downstream flow velocity were identical to the upstream flow velocity .",
    "this might be the case if the re - collimmation of the diverging flow from the conical shocks results in restoration of the flow lorentz factor to near the upstream value , and in this case the flux from successive cycles would be at about the same level , as observed in markarian 501 flares .",
    "the two flow velocities would also be roughly the same if the initial jet lorentz factor were much higher than @xmath95 used in fig .",
    "[ lc_of_coneshocks](a ) such that the intervals between flares due to a pair of conical shocks was roughly the same .",
    "however , in this case the flux of successive flares would diminish as the doppler factor decreases . turning this argument around",
    ", we may have a method of determining the minimum jet lorentz factor from observational data , e.g. the @xmath204  day periodicity in the 1997 markarian 501 data ( protheroe et al .",
    "1998 , hayashida et al .  1998 ) may be used to put a lower limit on @xmath76 .",

    "the resulting lightcurve looks , at least qualitatively , as good as any model for the variability of fluxes from blazars . note that even though there is no strict periodicity resulting from the excitation of a sequence of shocks in this case , each flare episode has two strong peaks due to ( for this viewing angle ) the apex of the first reverse shock cone and the apex of the first forward shock cone , and in each flare the separation between these two peaks is identical .",
    "fourier analysis would therefore show a strong peak at the frequency corresponding to the time interval between these two peaks in a single flare .",
    "many factors can influence observed variability time .",
    "the connection between @xmath8 , doppler factor and emission region geometry is non - trivial , and so measuring @xmath79 may give , at best , one of the dimensions of the emission region .",
    "using @xmath206 and @xmath207 may then lead to over - estimation or under - estimtion of the jet - frame photon energy density by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is clearly of importance in any agn model in which the low energy photons produced in the jet are targets for interaction of high energy particles or radiation , such as in ssc models and hadronic blazar models .",
    "although not discussed in detail in the present paper , the escape of @xmath4-rays from the emission region depends on the optical depth to photon - photon pair production interactions .",
    "this optical depth can be uncertain by orders of magnitude in the same way as the photon energy density , and will also depend on viewing angle",
    ". one must therefore be careful when using the observation of apparently unattenuated gamma - rays , and an observed variability time , to place limits on the doppler factor .",
    "the uncertainty in the jet - frame photon energy density discussed in this paper may also have implications for the high brightness temperature / compton catastrophe problem of idv sources . in this case",
    ", it is the energy density of target photons which limits the brightness temperature through the competition of inverse - compton scattering with synchrotron radiation , and the target photon energy density may actually be lower than estimated if the emission region is non - spherical .",
    "if the jet is bent or helical , or has some other favoured geometry ( e.g. conical shocks ) cusps in @xmath85 vs.  @xmath117 , and/or a varying doppler factor may cause narrow peaks in the observed lightcurve irrespective of other factors . distinguishing between these cases from the observed",
    "lightcurve alone is likely to be difficult .",
    "one way of distinguishing whether a flare is due to ( i ) an emission region moving around a bent or helical path , or ( ii ) a shock is exciting a curved , conical or helical structure within a jet , is that the in the first case the flare is caused by a change in viewing angle with respect to the motion of the emission region leading to a change in doppler factor , whereas in the second case the flare is due to a pile - up in observation times with no change in doppler factor .",
    "hence , in case ( i ) not only will the observed flux increase during a flare , but the photon energies also increase  increase in @xmath208 by factor @xmath209 accompanied by shift in @xmath210 by factor @xmath22 ( @xmath22 is ratio of final to initial doppler factor ) . in case ( ii ) , however , since there is no change in doppler factor there should be no shift in @xmath211 accompanying an increase in @xmath208 .",
    "distinguishing between the excitation of a conical and a helical structure by a plane shock would be almost impossible  note the qualitative similarities between lightcurves depicted in figs .",
    "[ agn_tvar_helix](d ) and [ lc_of_coneshocks](b ) .",
    "relativistic jet simulations ( bowman 1994 , gomez et al .",
    "1997 ) do show the presence of conical shocks , and these shocks appear after a large perturbation ( e.g. from 4 to 10 in the simulations of gomez et al .",
    "1997 ) in lorentz factor of the matter entering the jet through the nozzle .",
    "this can result in a sequence of quasi - stationary to superluminal reverse and forward conical shocks extending from the nozzle to the perturbation as it moves along the jet ( agudo et al .",
    "for the conical shock model ( salvati et al .",
    "1998 ) discussed here to work , a subsequent perturbation would need to result in a plane shock , or plane thin perturbation of some kind , which could travel along the jet and excite the pre - existing conical shocks .",
    "as far as i am aware , whether or not this could occur has not been demonstrated .",
    "a similar uncertainty hangs over whether or not helical jet structures , which may themselves be shocks with a twisted ribbon topology , resulting from a perturbation entering the jet through the nozzle , could subsequently be excited by the passage of a plane shock or perturbation . nevertheless",
    ", in both cases , if the viewing angle is favourable pile - ups in @xmath117 , and hence flares , could occur simply as a result of the motion of the conical or helical patterns which may themselves be sites of enhanced emission .",
    "note that in recent 3d relativistic jet simulations , the introduction of a 1 percent helical velocity perturbation at the nozzle results in a helical pattern propagating along the jet at nearly the beam speed ( aloy et al.1999 ) , and that the conical shocks resulting from a perturbation in jet lorentz factor can range from being quasi - stationary to superluminal ( agudo et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in conclusion , in models for flaring in agn",
    "in which the emission comes from a localized region ( blob ) co - moving with the jet , time variability is non - trivial to interpret in terms of emission region geometry and doppler factor .",
    "a further complication is that flaring may arise instead due to curved or helical motion of a blob , even if the emission is constant in the istantaneous rest frame of the blob . in this case ,",
    "apparent flaring is due to the change in viewing angle , and hence doppler factor . similarly ,",
    "if the viewing angle is favourable , relativistic motion of curved or helical filaments or surfaces can lead to observation of flares .",
    "excitation of curved or helical jet structures by shocks or perturbations can also lead to pile - ups in @xmath117 , and hence large apparent increases in flux .",
