    "in the context of cosmology , one of the most relevant astronomical observations of the last decade are those from distant type ia supernova implying that the universe is in a state of accelerated expansion @xcite which has been latter on confirmed by other observational probes @xcite .",
    "the fundamental nature of what is driving the cosmic acceleration is unknown , although many theoretical propositions have been put forward @xcite . invoking a cosmological constant to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe turns out to be the most economical option which moreover is in agreement with all the observational data @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the expected theoretical value of the cosmological constant is about 120 orders of magnitude larger than the measured one @xcite .",
    "whatever it is the fuel inducing the late - time acceleration of our universe , from a phenomenological point of view and in the framework of general relativity , it can be described through a dark energy component @xmath0 with an effective equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "the current value of @xmath2 is extremely close to @xmath3 @xcite ; i.e. a cosmological constant equation of state , but it can be larger than -1 like in quintessence models or even smaller @xcite .",
    "the latter case disclosed above is of no lesser importance .",
    "quite on the contrary : if dark energy has a phantom nature , i.e. , @xmath4 @xcite , then the scientific community is facing a most considerable twofold challenge : ( @xmath5 ) explaining the cause of the recent speed up of our universe and ( @xmath6 ) also how to accommodate a phantom energy component in our theoretical framework ; i.e. what can cause @xmath4 without invoking a real phantom energy which is known to violate the null energy condition and induce quantum instabilities @xcite .    a possibility to mimic such a phantom - like behaviour is within the paradigm of string inspired brane - world models , where matter ( standard model particles ) is confined on a 4-dimensional ( 4d ) hypersurface embedded in a higher dimensional space - time ( the bulk ) and where gravity is the only interaction experiencing the full bulk @xcite .",
    "more precisely , sahni and shtanov proposed the @xmath7dgp model with a phantom - like behaviour on the brane @xcite , _ without _ the need of any matter that violates the null energy condition on the brane .",
    "the @xmath7dgp scenario is a 5d brane - world model with infrared modifications to general relativity caused by an induced gravity term on the brane @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the normal or non self - accelerating branch of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati proposal ( dgp ) @xcite , which , unlike the self - accelerating dgp branch is free from the ghost problem @xcite , being the brane filled with cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant which drives the late - time acceleration of the brane .",
    "the phantom - like behaviour is a consequence of the extra - dimension which screens the brane cosmological constant and it is based in mapping the brane evolution to that of an equivalent 4d general relativistic phantom energy model @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the basis of this mimicry is an effective energy density ( in the 4d general relativistic picture ) corresponding to the cosmological constant corrected by the curvature effect due to the induced gravity term on the brane .",
    "this effective energy density grows as the brane expands and therefore effectively it behaves as a phantom fluid ; i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath2 corresponds to the ratio between the effective energy density and the effective pressure .",
    "the @xmath7dgp model in @xcite is by far the simplest way to mimic a phantom - like behaviour in a brane - world setup .",
    "other brane proposals aiming to produce such a mimicry are based on a bulk filled with matter and/or on an energy exchange between the brane and the bulk , therefore modifying the effective equation of state of dark energy on the brane @xcite .",
    "the effective description of the phantom behaviour in the @xmath7dgp model breaks down at a finite redshiftdgp model does not imply any sort of singularity on the brane nor in the bulk . ]",
    "figure 6 and section iv for a more detailed description ) ; i.e. the effective energy density vanishes and becomes negative over a certain redshift .",
    "when the effective energy density vanishes , the effective equation of state blows up .",
    "given that the phantom - like behaviour results from ( @xmath5 ) induced gravity effects on the brane causing curvature corrections and ( @xmath6 ) describing the brane model as a 4d relativistic phantom energy setup , could the break down of the phantom - like behaviour be eliminated by considering further curvature effects on the brane - world scenario ? this is the main question we address in this paper",
    ".    we will model such additional and new curvature effects through a gauss - bonnet term ( gb ) in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the reason behind including this specific curvature terms is that it induces an ultraviolet correction on the brane @xcite , as expected from high - energy stringy features , and therefore may modify the phantom - like behaviour at earlier times . eventually , affecting its long term dynamics and even possibly preventing the mentioned break down to occur at all .",
    "the other reason for considering such a curvature term was anticipated recently @xcite : even though the dgp model is characterised by an interesting infrared effect of gravity occurring with respect to general relativity , which for the self - accelerating branch can lead to a late - time acceleration on the brane even in the absence of any exotic matter invoked to produce the dark energy effect @xcite , it would be expected that a consistent dgp brane model would have also ultraviolet modifications as well , associated to high - energy stringy effects at earlier times .",
    "this paper is therefore outlined as follows . in section [ sect2 ] , we define a brane - world model , henceforth designated as @xmath7dgp - gb model , and constrain the set of parameters that defined it in such away that the brane is currently accelerating .",
    "we also comment on the non super - acceleration of the brane . in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we solve the cubic friedmann equation for the normal dgp branch with a gb term in the bulk : the reason is to obtain an accurate description of the effective energy density , that will behave like a phantom component on the brane , which depends explicitly on the hubble rate . in section [ sect3 ] ,",
    "we subsequently show how a mimicry of a phantom behaviour takes place on the brane _ without _ considering any matter that violates the null energy condition on the brane .",
    "then , we compare the behaviour of the @xmath7dgp - gb setting with the behaviour found on the @xmath7dgp model @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sect5 ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "we also present some results related to the solutions of the cubic friedmann equation ( [ friedmannnb ] ) in the appendix a. on the other hand , in the appendix b , we show under which conditions the @xmath7dgp model is recovered from the model we propose .",
    "the generalised friedmann equation of a brane with induced gravity embedded in a 5d minkowski bulk with a gb term reads @xcite @xmath8 where a mirror symmetry has been assumed across the brane . in the previous equation @xmath9",
    "is the crossover scale in the dgp model @xcite and has length unit .",
    "this parameter measures the strength of the induced gravity effect on the brane and is related to the 4d and 5d gravitational constants by @xmath10 on the other hand , the parameter @xmath11 measures the strength of the gb curvature effect on the brane and has length square unit and is positive @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 , then the induced gravity in the dgp setup modifies the late - time evolution of the brane with respect to the standard 4d relativistic case @xcite ( for an alternative approach where the induced gravity effect corresponds to a correction to rs model at high energies see ,  e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if it is instead @xmath13 then the gb term modifies the early - time evolution of the brane @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) can be conveniently rewritten as @xmath14 which generalises the friedmann equation of the self - accelerating dgp solution @xcite ( @xmath15 sign in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann2 ] ) with @xmath12 ) ; i.e we recover the self - accelerating solution when @xmath12 . on the other hand , eq .",

    "we restrict to the normal branch ; i.e. @xmath16 sign in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we consider that the energy density of the brane @xmath17 corresponds to a cdm component with energy density @xmath18 and a cosmological constant @xmath7 @xmath19 with the latter driving the late - time acceleration of the brane",
    ". we will refer to this scenario as the @xmath7dgp - gb model .",
    "the total energy density of the brane is conserved and therefore also the sector corresponding to the cdm , which scales in the standard way with the redshift @xmath20 from now on a subscript @xmath21 stands for the observed current value of a given quantity .",
    "finally , the friedmann equation on the brane can be presented as @xmath22e(z ) , \\label{friedmannz}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the usual convenient dimensionless parameters while the new parameter @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26    evaluating the friedmann equation ( [ friedmannz ] ) at @xmath27 gives a constraint on the cosmological parameters of the model @xmath28 for @xmath29 we recover the constraint in the @xmath7dgp model . the constraint ( [ cosmoconstraint ] )",
    "implies that the region @xmath30 is unphysical .",
    "moreover , although the brane is spatially flat , the previous constraint can be interpreted in the sense that our model constitutes a mimic of a closed flrw universe in the ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) plane . in particular , this is likewise to what happens in @xmath7dgp , qdgp and cdgp models @xcite .",
    "we recall that the qdgp and cdgp models correspond to variants of the @xmath7dgp scenario , where the late - time evolution of the universe is driven by a quiessence @xcite and a chaplygin gas @xcite , respectively , instead of a cosmological constant .",
    "their dark energy effect is more dynamical and the phantom divide ( or the @xmath33 line ) crossing is possible in the qdgp and cdgp unlike in the @xmath7dgp model @xcite .",
    "we remind that the interest on modelling a mimicry of a phantom divide crossing is based on the possibility ( backed by recent observational data ) that the equation of state may have crossed the cosmological constant barrier ( @xmath33 ) .    coming back to our model , if the dimensionless crossover energy density @xmath34 is the same in a @xmath7dgp model and in our model ( which is not necessarily the case ) , then the similarities with a spatially closed universe are made more significant from the gb effect , since @xmath35 .",
    "notice that this statement also applies to the variants of the @xmath7dgp brane mentioned previously and their generalisations by the gb effect , if the acceleration of both branes is driven by the same sort of dark energy .",
    "in fact , in this case the appropriately modified constraint ( [ cosmoconstraint ] ) would read @xmath36 where @xmath37 correspond to the current dimensionless energy density of dark energy on the brane which can be for example modelled by a quiessence or a chaplygin gas .",
    "furthermore , by imposing that the universe is currently accelerating ; i.e. the deceleration parameter @xmath38 is currently negative , where @xmath39,\\ ] ] we obtain another constraint on the set of cosmological parameters @xmath31 , @xmath34 and @xmath40 , which reads @xmath41 an example of the cosmological evolution of the deceleration parameter is given in fig .",
    "[ pq ] where it can be seen that the brane accelerates at late - time .",
    "on the other hand , the modified raychaudhuri equation follows easily from the friedmann equation of the brane and the conservation of the brane energy density .",
    "it can be written as @xmath42 where a dot stands for the derivative respect to the cosmic time .",
    "the key point of the previous equation is that the brane never super - accelerates ; i.e. the hubble rate decreases as the brane expands .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show in section [ sect3 ] , a phantom - like behaviour takes place at the brane : this occurs _ without _ including any matter that violates the null energy condition .",
    "the phantom - like behaviour is based in defining an effective energy density which corresponds to a balance between the cosmological constant and geometrical effects encoded on the hubble rate evolution . therefore , in order to get the evolution of the effective energy density with the redshift it is necessary to solve the cubic friedmann equation of the normal branch ( eq .",

    "the solutions and an analysis of the mentioned friedmann equation is presented on the next section .    .",

    "the analysis of this case is slightly involved .",
    "the reason is essentially that if @xmath54 then @xmath56 and @xmath57 are real [ see eqs  ( [ defbarrho1 ] ) and ( [ defbarrho2 ] ) ] and therefore it is not as straightforward as in the next cases to know the number of real solutions of the cubic friedmann equation on @xmath58 ; i.e. to know the sign of @xmath44 [ see eq .",

    "<S> _ phantom fluid behaviour can emerge in brane cosmology ; in particular , within the normal non self - accelerating dgp branch , _ without _ any exotic matter and due to curvature effects from induced gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the phantom - like behaviour is based in defining an effective energy density that grows as the brane expands . </S>",
    "<S> this effective description breaks down at some point in the past when the effective energy density becomes negative and the effective equation of state parameter blows up . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate if the phantom - like regime can be enlarged by the inclusion of a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term into the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation is that such a gb component would model additional curvature effects on the brane setting . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , our aim is to determine if the gb term , dominating and modifying the early behaviour of the brane universe , may eventually extend the regime of validity of the phantom mimicry on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that the opposite occurs : the gb effect seems instead to induce a breakdown of the phantom - like behaviour at an even smaller redshift . </S>"
