    "when taxicab geometry is mentioned , the context is often a contrast with two - dimensional euclidean geometry . whatever the emphasis , the depth of the discussion frequently does not venture far beyond how the measurement of length is affected by the usual euclidean metric being replaced with the taxicab metric where the distance between two points @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by @xmath2    papers have appeared that explore length in taxicab geometry in greater detail @xcite , and a few papers have derived area and volume formulae for certain figures and solids using exclusively taxicab measurements @xcite .",
    "however , this well - built foundation has left a number of open questions . what is the taxicab length of a curve in two dimensions ? in three dimensions ?",
    "what does area actually mean in two - dimensional taxicab geometry ?",
    "is the taxicab area of a `` flat '' surface in three dimensions comparable to the taxicab area of the `` same '' surface ( in a euclidean sense ) in two dimensions ?",
    "these are all fundamental questions that do not appear to have been answered by the current body of research in taxicab geometry . in this paper",
    "we wish to provide a comprehensive , unified view of length , area , and volume in taxicab geometry .",
    "where suitable and enlightening , we will use the value @xmath3 as the value for @xmath4 in taxicab geometry @xcite .",
    "the first dimensional measure we will examine is the simplest of the measures : the measurement of length .",
    "this is also , for line segments at least , the most well understood measure in taxicab geometry .",
    "the simplest measurement of length is the length of a line segment in one dimension . on this point ,",
    "euclidean and taxicab geometry are in complete agreement .",
    "the length of a line segment from a point @xmath5 to another point @xmath6 is simply the number of unit lengths covered by the line segment , @xmath7      in two dimensions , however , the euclidean and taxicab metrics are not always in agreement on the length of a line segment . for line segments parallel to a coordinate axis , such as the line segment with endpoints @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "there is agreement since both metrics reduce to one - dimensional measurement : @xmath10 . only when the line segment is not parallel to one of the coordinate axes do we finally see disagreement between the euclidean and taxicab metrics .",
    "the taxicab length of such a line segment can be viewed as the sum of the euclidean lengths of the projections of the line segment onto the coordinate axes ( figure [ taxicab_length ] ) , @xmath11    the pythagorean theorem tells us the euclidean and taxicab lengths will generally not agree for line segments that are not parallel to one of the coordinate axes .",
    "line segments of the same euclidean length will have various taxicab lengths as their position relative to the coordinate axes changes .",
    "if one were to place a scale on a diagonal line , the euclidean and taxicab markings would differ with the largest discrepancy being at a @xmath12 angle to the coordinate axes ( figure [ scale_diff ] ) .",
    "these cases and types of length measurement are well known and are well understood to those familiar with taxicab geometry .",
    "but , even in two dimensions , there is at least one other type of length measurement in euclidean geometry : the length of a curve .",
    "how is the length of a ( functional ) curve in two dimensions measured in taxicab geometry ?      in euclidean geometry , the arc length of a curve described by a function @xmath13 with a continuous derivative over an interval @xmath14 $ ] is given by @xmath15 ^ 2 } \\",
    ", dx\\ ] ]    to find a corresponding formula in taxicab geometry , we may follow a traditional method for deriving arc length .",
    "first , split the interval @xmath14 $ ] into @xmath16 subintervals with widths @xmath17 by defining points @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( figure [ arc_length_2d ] ) .",
    "this allows for definition of points @xmath21 on the curve whose @xmath22-coordinates are @xmath23 . by connecting these points",
    ", we obtain a polygonal path approximating the curve . at this crucial point of the derivation",
    "we apply the taxicab metric instead of the euclidean metric to obtain the taxicab length @xmath24 of the @xmath25th line segment , @xmath26 by the mean value theorem , there is a point @xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the taxicab length of the @xmath25th segment becomes @xmath31 and the taxicab length of the entire polygonal path is @xmath32 by increasing the number of subintervals while forcing @xmath33 , the length of the polygonal path will approach the arc length of the curve .",
    "so , @xmath34 the right side of this equation is a definite integral , so the taxicab arc length of the curve described by the function @xmath13 over the interval @xmath14 $ ] is given by @xmath35    as an example , the northeast quadrant of a taxicab circle of radius @xmath36 centered at the origin is described by @xmath37 .",
    "the arc length of this curve over the interval @xmath38 $ ] is given by @xmath39 which is precisely one - fourth of the circumference of a taxicab circle of radius @xmath36 .",
    "a more interesting application involves the northeast quadrant of the euclidean circle of radius @xmath36 at the origin described by @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41    the distance is the same as if we had traveled along the taxicab circle between the two endpoints !",
    "while this is a shocking result to the euclidean observer who is accustomed to distinct paths between two points generally having different lengths , the taxicab observer merely shrugs his shoulders .",
    "a curve such as a euclidean circle can be approximated with increasingly small horizontal and vertical steps near its path ( figure [ different_paths]b ) . as any good introduction to taxicab geometry teaches us , such as krause @xcite ,",
    "multiple straight - line paths between two points have the same length in taxicab geometry ( see figure [ different_paths]a ) .",
    "so , each of these approximations of the euclidean circle will have the same taxicab length .",
    "therefore , we should expect the limiting case to also have the same length . to further make the point",
    ", we can follow the euclidean parabola @xmath42 in the first quadrant and arrive at the same result ( figure [ multiple_curves ] ) .",
    "@xmath43    to formalize these observations , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ thm_multiple_paths ] if a function @xmath13 is monotone increasing or decreasing and differentiable with a continuous derivative over an interval @xmath14 $ ] , then the arc length of @xmath13 over @xmath14 $ ] is @xmath44 ( i.e. the path from @xmath45 to @xmath46 is independent of the function @xmath13 under the stated conditions ) .",
    "the taxicab arc length of @xmath13 over @xmath14 $ ] is @xmath47 if f is monotone increasing , @xmath48 . and ,",
    "since f has a continuous derivative , we may apply the first fundamental theorem of calculus to get @xmath49 if f is monotone decreasing , we get the similar result @xmath50 in either case , the latter difference must be positive so we have @xmath44    for functions that are not monotone increasing or decreasing , the arc length can be found using this theorem by taking the sum of the arc lengths over the subintervals where the function is monotone increasing or decreasing .",
    "the taxicab length of a line segment in three dimensions is a natural extension of the formula in two dimensions . for a line segment with endpoints @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 a nice discussion of the three - dimensional metric and other properties",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "there are no surprises here , and the taxicab length can be viewed as the sum of the euclidean lengths of the projections of the line segment onto the three coordinate axes .",
    "the simplest extension of the arc length of a curve to three dimensions is for parametric curves . for a curve in two dimensions",
    ", we can parameterize the function @xmath54 and modify equation ( [ eq_arc_length_2d ] ) to get @xmath55 generalizing this to three dimensions , we have @xmath56 intuitively , theorem [ thm_multiple_paths ] generalizes to three - dimensions saying that the length of a three - dimensional `` monotonic '' curve depends only on its endpoints .",
    "in prior research regarding area in taxicab geometry @xcite , the underlying assumption has been that the area of a figure should agree in euclidean and taxicab geometry , although the formulae to compute the area could be vastly different .",
    "additionally , it appears area has only been investigated in two dimensions . in this section",
    "we wish to examine this assumption about area and explore surface area in three dimensions .",
    "figure [ fig_square_area ] gets right to the question of what area means in taxicab geometry .",
    "the figures shown are each squares in both geometries : all sides and angles have the same measure . if we cling to the notion that the area of a square is the square of the length of its sides , these figures have equal euclidean area ( 2 ) but very different taxicab areas ( 4 and 2 ) .",
    "the position of the sides of the square relative to the coordinate axes in taxicab geometry affects their length which in turn affects the area calculation .",
    "we have a choice before us .",
    "we can cling to the area of a square being the square of its sides and live with the position of a figure affecting its taxicab area just as the position of a line segment affects its taxicab length . or",
    ", we can maintain consistency with the euclidean area of the figure and , as in this example , seek a new formula for the area of a square .",
    "several points here and later in this paper will hopefully help us to make a firm decision here .",
    "reviewing the nature of length in taxicab geometry , we see agreement with euclidean geometry on the length of a line segment ( a one - dimensional `` figure '' ) in one dimension . only for line segments in two dimensions , a dimension higher than the figure , do we see discrepancies between the geometries .",
    "if we apply this same logic to area , the geometries should agree on area ( a two - dimensional figure ) in two dimensions . only for the area of a surface in three dimensions",
    "would we expect to see differences because the figure would have a different position relative to the coordinate planes .",
    "in addition , the area of a figure has traditionally been viewed as the number of square units of the plane enclosed by the figure . since euclidean and taxicab geometry",
    "are built on the cartesian coordinate system , it seems logical the computation of area in two dimensions should agree in these two geometries .    with this reasoning",
    ", we proceed with the traditional euclidean concept of area in two dimensions while looking for the proper extension of the concept to three dimensions .",
    "therefore , for our example , we would need a new formula for the taxicab area of a square .",
    "( for the interested reader , it can be shown that the area of a square in terms of the taxicab length @xmath57 of its sides is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the taxicab angle between one of the sides and the @xmath22-axis and the trigonometric functions are taxicab @xcite . )",
    "the standard approach to the computation of two - dimensional area in undergraduate calculus courses is integration .",
    "estimates of area under a functional curve involve increasing numbers of rectangles that each approximate a portion of the area under the curve .",
    "since euclidean and taxicab geometry agree on length in the horizontal and vertical directions , these area approximations in the two geometries will agree .",
    "therefore , we should expect the calculation of area under a curve by integration to transfer seamlessly to taxicab geometry .",
    "this is a further argument to view area in two dimensions consistently between the two geometries .      as stated in a previous section",
    ", we should expect the taxicab area of a `` flat '' surface in three dimensions to differ from the area of the `` same '' figure ( in a euclidean sense ) in one of the coordinate planes .",
    "this follows from the pattern seen with line segments in one and two dimensions . to discover how the area will differ , consider a plane rotated upward from the @xmath60-plane along the @xmath61-axis ( figure [ fig_rotated_plane ] ) .    in a manner similar to figure [ scale_diff ] , the taxicab scale in the @xmath22-direction",
    "will be compressed in the rotated plane compared to the euclidean scale .",
    "the angle @xmath59 formed in a plane parallel to the @xmath62-plane will determine the scaling effect seen in the one dimension of the rotated plane with the maximal difference occurring at @xmath12 .",
    "the result is the `` same '' figure ( in a euclidean sense ) in the @xmath60-plane and in the rotated plane will have different taxicab areas .",
    "( interestingly , the taxicab coordinate grid in the rotated plane is not even composed of euclidean squares but of euclidean rectangles since the taxicab scale in the @xmath61-direction is unaffected by the specific rotation performed . )    as a specific example , a unit square at the origin in the @xmath60-plane will have a euclidean and taxicab area of 1 .",
    "if we rotate the square upward @xmath12 along the @xmath61-axis , the euclidean area will be unchanged but the taxicab area will now be @xmath63 since one side will now have taxicab length @xmath64 .",
    "if the plane is instead rotated along the @xmath22-axis , the taxicab area is again found by scaling the euclidean area .",
    "when rotation occurs in both manners , the scaling factors compound each other .",
    "so , the taxicab area of a figure in the rotated plane can be found from its euclidean area using equation ( [ eq_taxicab_length ] ) as a guide for each direction of rotation : the scaling factors are sums of the ( euclidean ) cosine and sine of the angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 formed by lines in cross - sectional planes parallel to the @xmath62-plane and the @xmath67-plane similar to the single rotation illustrated in figure [ fig_rotated_plane ] , @xmath68      in @xcite janssen makes several attempts to revolve half a taxicab circle about an axis to obtain a taxicab sphere .",
    "the first approach revolves the upper half of a taxicab circle in a _",
    "euclidean _ manner about the horizontal axis resulting in a `` sphere '' with some straight edges but also with some curved surfaces ( figure [ fig_spheres]a ) .",
    "this does not seem to quite fit the `` squarish '' nature of seemingly everything in taxicab geometry and does not appear to satisfy the usual definition of a sphere ( all points equidistant from the center ) .",
    "the author s line of thought is quite instructive , however .",
    "if we consider a euclidean solid of revolution about the @xmath22-axis , the cross - section of the solid in the @xmath67-plane is a euclidean circle .",
    "therefore , for a taxicab revolution about the @xmath22-axis , the cross - section should be a _",
    "taxicab _ circle in that plane .",
    "a taxicab sphere obtained by revolving a taxicab circle about the horizontal axis in a taxicab manner would yield figure [ fig_spheres]b .",
    "this completely `` squarish '' object seems to fit the geometry better and indeed does , by construction , satisfy the usual definition of a sphere .",
    "so , revolution about the horizontal axis should follow the path of a taxicab circle in the @xmath67-plane and not the path of a euclidean circle .    as an application of our approach to surface area in three dimensions",
    ", we would like to find a formula for the surface area of a solid of revolution .",
    "for a differentiable function @xmath13 over an interval @xmath14 $ ] divide the interval into @xmath16 subintervals . using a linear approximation of the curve over each subinterval",
    ", we revolve each line segment about the @xmath22-axis . in the euclidean derivation",
    ", this creates the frustrum of a cone . in taxicab geometry ,",
    "the discussion above shows us this will create the frustrum of a taxicab cone , which is equivalent to the frustrum an euclidean right square pyramid ( partially shown in figure [ fig_revolve ] ) . to find the taxicab surface area of the frustrum",
    ", we will compute the euclidean area and then scale the area by examining the rotations of the frustrum sides to the @xmath60-plane .",
    "the euclidean surface area of the frustrum of a pyramid is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the perimeters of the `` top '' and `` bottom '' edges of the frustrum and @xmath57 is the slant height . for the @xmath25th subinterval ,",
    "the euclidean perimeters are @xmath72 and @xmath73 . to compute the slant height , we project the shaded triangle in figure [ fig_revolve ] onto a plane parallel to the @xmath67-plane .",
    "the slant height @xmath57 is the hypotenuse of the right triangle @xmath74 .",
    "the projected triangle is an isoceles right triangle with legs of length @xmath75 ( labeled @xmath76 in the figure ) , so the altitude of this triangle is @xmath77 .",

    "the portion outside the radical is very reminiscent of the euclidean formula with the expected changes in the circle circumference factor ( @xmath89 ) and the arc length factor ( @xmath90 ) due to the taxicab metric .",
    "the extra radical represents a scaling factor based on the ratio of the slant height to the linear approximation of the curve .",
    "the greater the difference between these two quantities the more the frustrum sides are rotated with respect to the @xmath60-plane thus requiring more scaling .",
    "if these two quantities are close , the frustrum sides are rotated very little and therefore require little scaling .    to complete the analysis inspired by janssen , half of a taxicab sphere of radius @xmath36 is obtained by revolving the function @xmath91 over the interval @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "doubling this result yields the surface area of a whole taxicab sphere : @xmath92 such a taxicab sphere is composed of two euclidean right square pyramids of height @xmath93 and base side length @xmath94 .",
    "the euclidean surface area is therefore @xmath95 . since the sides are at @xmath12 angles to the @xmath60-plane in both directions , the taxicab area scaling factors are both @xmath63 .",
    "this gives a taxicab surface area of @xmath96 in perfect agreement with the formula obtained from the solid of revolution .",
    "if we follow the same pattern used for length and area measures , we expect the euclidean and taxicab volume of a solid ( a three - dimensional object ) in three dimensions to be equal . only in four dimensions",
    "would we expect orientation of the solid to impact the taxicab volume when compared to the euclidean volume .      to compute the volume of a euclidean solid of revolution ,",
    "the traditional `` slicing '' method involves computing the volume of an infinitessimal cylinder as @xmath79 multipled by the area of the euclidean circle of revolution .",
    "this method can be adapted directly into taxicab geometry by replacing the euclidean circle area with the taxicab circle area _ if _ the volume of a taxicab cylinder is found in the same manner .",
    "a taxicab cylinder resembles an euclidean cylinder except that the cross section is a taxicab circle ( figure [ fig_cylinder ] ) .",
    "for such a cylinder lying along the @xmath22-axis , the cross - sectional area will lie in a plane parallel to the @xmath67-plane and therefore the euclidean and taxicab areas will agree .",
    "in addition , the height of the cylinder will agree in the two geometries as it lies along a coordinate axis .",
    "based on our assumption that volume will agree in three dimensions between the geometries , the taxicab volume of a cylinder is the product of the area of the cross - sectional taxicab circle and the height .    a taxicab circle of radius @xmath36 is composed of four isoceles triangles with area @xmath97 ( proposition 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a taxicab cylinder of radius @xmath36 and height @xmath98 will have volume @xmath99    with this information we can now compute the volume of a solid of revolution obtained by revolving a continuous function @xmath13 about the @xmath22-axis over an interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
