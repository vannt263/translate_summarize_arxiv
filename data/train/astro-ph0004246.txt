    "it is now well established that the solar photosphere is threaded with strong ( kilogauss ) magnetic fields in the form of vertical flux tubes located in the network , where they are observed as bright points .",
    "observations have revealed that these network bright points ( nbps ) are in a highly dynamical state due to the buffeting action of granules ( e.g. muller 1983 ; muller et al .",
    "1994 ; berger & title 1996 ; berger et al . 1998 ; van ballegooijen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the jostling of magnetic elements by granules can excite oscillations in flux tubes , which can in principle be an important mechanism for chromospheric and coronal heating , provided that the motions are rapid enough ( choudhuri , auffret & priest 1993 ; steiner , knlker & schssler 1994 ; hasan & kalkofen 1999 , hereafter paper i ) . as transverse waves , excited in the photosphere , travel upwards their velocity amplitude increases . in chromospheric layers ,",
    "the velocity amplitude becomes comparable to the tube speed for kink waves , leading to an efficient coupling with longitudinal waves ( kalkofen 1997 ) .",
    "the latter can dissipate by forming shocks ( e.g. zhugzhda , bromm & ulmschneider 1995 ) .",
    "in paper i it was argued that network oscillations can be efficiently excited through the buffeting action on flux tubes by external granules with intermittent motions ( of about 2 km s@xmath0 ) occurring on a time scale of less than about half the cutoff period of kink waves .",
    "typically , a period of 1 min . is consistent with the general result .",
    "we assumed an analytic form for the external motions . in the present work ,",
    "we use observational data obtained at the swedish solar observatory at la palma during 1995 ( berger et al .",
    "1998 ) to infer the horizontal footpoint motions of magnetic elements in the photosphere .",
    "we model the response of flux tubes to these motions and calculate the energy flux in upward - propagating transverse ( kink ) waves .",
    "we also simulate the effect of hypothetical motions on time scales of a few seconds , which could significantly enhance the energy flux in kink waves .",
    "finally , we examine some implications of our results .",
    "the data were collected on october 5 , 1995 between 10:57 and 12:08 ut , simultaneously in the g band ( 4305  ) and the nearby continuum ( 4686  ) , using the phase - diversity method ( see lfdahl et al .",
    "1998 ; berger et al . 1998 ) . after filtering out @xmath1mode oscillations , a time series of 180 images was obtained , with high spatial resolution and with an interval between frames of 23.5  s. following berger et al .",
    ", we subtract the images in the g band and 4686   , which clearly highlights the network bright points .",
    "the motion of the bright points was followed using a tracking technique with `` corks '' as tracers of bright points ( van ballegooijen et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the corks , each with a radius of 60 km ( the pixel size of the current data set ) , were advected by an artificial flow field that is proportional to the gradient of the intensity in the magnetic image , and their positions were followed in time ( for details see paper ii ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the cork positions superposed on a typical frame of a magnetic difference image , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the horizontal coordinates on the sun .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show the @xmath2 and @xmath3 components of the velocity as a function of time for two representative corks , whose initial locations are indicated by arrows in figure 1 .",
    "# 1#2#1 # 1e^#1 # 1e^#1 # 1e^i#1 # 1 # 1#2#1 # 1 # 1#2#1    let us assume that the motion of the g band bright points can be taken as a proxy for the footpoint motion of flux tubes at the base of the photosphere ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we assume that flux tubes are isothermal and `` thin '' compared to the pressure scale height @xmath5 .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of the `` reduced '' transverse displacement @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lagrangian displacement .",
    "once the footpoint motion is specified , the velocity ( @xmath8 ) at any height @xmath9 and time @xmath10 can be determined by the following expression ( paper i ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a bessel function , @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the propagation speed and cutoff frequency for kink waves , given by : @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath18 is the sound speed , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the gas pressure inside the tube and @xmath23 is the magnitude of the vertical component of the magnetic field on the tube axis .",
    "the energy flux ( @xmath24 ) in a single flux tube is given by ( paper i ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the external gas pressure at @xmath4 .",
    "figures 3a and 3b show the vertical energy flux in transverse waves versus time at a height @xmath27  km for two observed magnetic elements located initially at the coordinates shown above the figure .",
    "the left and right panels correspond to footpoint motions with the @xmath28 and @xmath29 components of the velocity , respectively .",
    "we find that the injection of energy into the chromosphere takes place in brief and intermittent bursts , lasting typically 30 s , separated by longer periods ( longer than the time scale for radiative losses in the chromosphere ) with lower energy flux .",
    "the peak energy flux into the chromosphere is as high as @xmath30 erg @xmath31 s@xmath0 in a single flux tube , although the time - averaged flux is @xmath32 erg @xmath31 s@xmath0 .",
    "this scenario for heating the magnetic network would produce strongly intermittent chromospheric emission consisting of brief intense flashes superimposed on generally a very low background .",
    "however , in dense network regions the observed chromospheric emission is stably present and exhibits relatively low amplitude , long - period variations ( e.g. dam , gouttebroze and malherbe 1984 ; von uexkll et al .",
    "1989 ; lites , rutten and kalkofen 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the above scenario can not readily explain the observed persistence of emission from dense network regions .",
    "a possible remedy is to consider the effect of high frequency motions .",
    "the observations of g band bright points were taken with a time cadence of 23.5  s. however , the possibility of random footpoint motions occurring on a shorter time scale can not be ruled out .",
    "the solar convection has very high reynolds number and is expected to be highly turbulent , involving a wide range of length and time scales . indeed , spectroscopic observations of the solar granulation have shown enhanced broadening of spectral lines in intergranular lanes , indicating enhanced turbulence within these region ( e.g. nesis et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "magnetic flux tubes interact with these turbulent flows within the lanes .",
    "we speculate that these interactions produce transverse displacements of magnetic field lines on length scales much less than the flux tube diameter ( @xmath33 km ) , i.e. , the magnetic field inside a flux tube has fine structure on transverse scales @xmath34 km .",
    "these perturbations likely generate alfvn waves which propagate upward along the field lines and dissipate their energy higher up in chromosphere .",
    "the velocity at small spatial scale can be estimated as follows . assuming the turbulence has a kolmogoroff spectrum , the velocity of eddies on length scale @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the outer scale of the turbulence , and @xmath38 is the velocity of the largest eddies .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 is given by the width of an intergranular lane as determined from 3d simulations of the solar granulation ( e.g. , stein and nordlund 1998 ) , and that @xmath38 is the convective velocity predicted by such simulations : @xmath39 100 km and @xmath40 2.5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this turbulence model predicts that @xmath41  1  km  s@xmath0 on a length scale @xmath42 10 km , i.e. , there is significant power in motions at this scale .",
    "the time scale of such motions is @xmath43 10 s , which is significantly shorter than the time scale for granular buffeting .    in the following we simulate the effect of such high - frequency motions on the response of the flux tube ( similar to the study of longitudinal wave excitation in flux tubes by ulmschneider and musielak 1998 ) . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the small transverse scale of the motions and we describe the `` turbulence '' in terms of footpoint displacements of the flux tube .",
    "we do this by superposing random motions , with a rms amplitude of 1 km s@xmath0 and a zero mean value , on the observationally determined velocity . the random motions vary on a time scale of 2.35 s. such high - frequency motions ( if present ) would not have been detected in the present observations .",
    "hence , it is not possible _ a priori _ to rule them out .",
    "results from such simulations are shown in figures 4a and 4b for the @xmath2 component of the velocity as a function of time for two representative corks whose initial locations are indicated above each panel , and in figures 5a and 5b for the corresponding vertical energy wave flux .",
    "we note that the energy flux in upward - propagating transverse waves is much larger and less intermittent than in the case without high - frequency footpoint motions .",
    "the energy flux in the form of high - frequency transverse waves appears adequate to continuously heat the chromosphere . taking a filling factor of 10% at a height @xmath27  km above the photosphere ,",
    "the predicted flux is approximately erg @xmath31 s@xmath0 , which is sufficient to balance the observed radiative loss of the chromospheric network ( @xmath44 erg @xmath31 s@xmath0 , see model f@xmath45 in avrett 1985 )",
    "the energy flux in upward propagating transverse waves has been shown for a few representative magnetic elements .",
    "we should point out that we carried out similar calculations for several corks , before selecting two as being typical of the large sample that we examined .",
    "we find that the injection of energy into the chromosphere occurs in brief and intermittent bursts ( lasting typically 30 - 60 s ) , separated by longer periods ( longer than the typical time scale for radiative loss ) with low energy flux .",
    "the peak energy flux into the chromosphere is typically @xmath46 erg @xmath31 s@xmath0 in a single flux tube .",
    "observationally , such a scenario for heating of the magnetic network on a 1 arc sec scale would lead to high variability in ca ii k emission , contrary to observations . however , the observations of g band bright points used here do not have the time resolution and sensitivity necessary to detect motions on shorter time scales .",
    "we simulate such high - frequency motions by adding random velocity fluctuations with a zero mean value and an rms amplitude of 1  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that for transverse waves to provide a viable mechanism for _ sustained _ chromospheric heating , the main contribution to the heating must come from high - frequency motions ( periods 5 - 50 s ) .",
    "the proposed high - frequency motions have very small spatial scale ( 10 - 100 km ) and the transverse displacements involved are also very small ( for example , a motion with period 50 s and velocity amplitude of 1  km  s@xmath0 has a displacement amplitude of only 8 km ) .",
    "such length scales are well below the angular resolution of present - day solar telescopes .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that such high - frequency motions will ever be detected in studies of the proper motions of photospheric flux tubes .",
    "spectroscopic methods , such as measurements of spectral line broadening by unresolved turbulent flows , offer greater promise but will still require very high angular resolution ."
