    "the phenomenon of zitterbewegung ( zb , trembling motion ) goes back to schrodinger who proposed it in 1930 for free relativistic electrons in a vacuum  @xcite .",
    "schrodinger observed that , due to non - commutativity of the velocity operators with the dirac hamiltonian , relativistic electrons experience a trembling motion in absence of external fields .",
    "it was later recognized that zb is due to an interference of electron states with positive and negative electron energies . a very high frequency of zb in a vacuum , corresponding to  @xmath0 , and its very small amplitude on the order of the compton wavelength  @xmath1    made it impossible to observe this effect in its original form with the currently available experimental methods .",
    "however , in a recent work gerritsma _",
    "_  @xcite simulated the 1 + 1 dirac equation and the resulting zitterbewegung with the use of trapped ions excited by laser beams .",
    "the important advantage of this method is that one can simulate also the basic parameters of the dirac equation and tailor their desired values .",
    "the result of gerritsma _ et al .",
    "_ allows one to expect that observable effects for relativistic particles in a vacuum can be convincingly reproduced with more `` user friendly '' parameters . in general , there has been recently a revival of interest in the relativistic - type equations related to `` the rise of graphene ''  @xcite , topological insulators and similar systems in narrow - gap semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to describe the phenomenon of zitterbewegung for charged klein - gordon ( kg ) spin - zero particles in absence of fields and in the presence of a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the zitterbewegung of kg particles in absence of fields was described before , see  @xcite . however ,",
    "in our treatment we introduce a number of additional elements .",
    "first , we describe the particles by wave packets and show that this feature leads to a transient character of the resulting zb motion .",
    "second , we use both the hamiltonian and wave forms of klein - gordon equation ( kge ) and show the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "third , we point out that zb is a result of interference between positive and negative energy sub - packets propagating with different velocities .",
    "fourth , we simulate classically the zb motion using a simple mechanical system proposed by morse and feshbach  @xcite . still , our main objective is to consider in detail the dynamics of a charged kg particle in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field and describe the phenomenon of zb in this situation . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this problem has not been treated before .",
    "the one - particle klein - gordon equation for spin - zero particles leads to some well known difficulties  @xcite .",
    "the kg equation involves second time derivative , the probability density is not positively definite , there are problems with the position operator or vanishing square of the velocity operator .",
    "for this reason in the present work we calculate zb of _ average current _ which has well defined meaning in the theory of kg equation . for charged particles",
    "the average current is proportional to average particle velocity , so in our work we calculate one of these two quantities . in previous treatments of zb for dirac equation ,",
    "simulation by trapped ions or solid - state systems , the authors usually calculated zb of the position operator .    in our considerations we encounter another interesting anomaly of kg equation , namely , that particle velocities can exceed the speed of light for sufficiently large momenta . in other words",
    "it appears that , in contrast to the dirac equation for electrons , kge does not posses an automatic `` safety brake '' for velocities to keep them below  @xmath2 . to our knowledge",
