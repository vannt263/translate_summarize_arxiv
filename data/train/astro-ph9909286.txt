    "accumulating observational evidence shows the exsistence of astrophysical objects with extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath7 .",
    "kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have revealed that a galactic x - ray pulsar with an estimated magnetic field of @xmath8 causes recurrent bursts of soft @xmath9-rays , which are called soft gamma repeaters .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with short and more intense bursts of @xmath10 photons still remain puzzling although it has been progressively clearer that they are likely to have a cosmological origin .",
    "some of the theoretical models of grbs ( usov 1992 , kluniak & ruderman 1998 , and pacsyski 1998 ) invoke compact objects for their central engines such as neutron stars or rotating black holes with extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath11 in order to produce ultra - relativistic energy flow of a huge lorentz factor @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , neutron stars or black holes with strong magnetic fields have been proposed by many authors ( hillas 1984 , and references therein ) as an acceleration site of ultra high - enrgy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "milgrom & usov ( 1995 ) suggested possible association of the two highest energy uhecrs with strong grbs in their error boxes .",
    "an ultra - relativistic nucleus gives rise to efficient meson emission , in analogy with the canonical photon synchrotron radiation , in such a strong magnetic field because it couples strongly to meson fields as well as to an electromagnetic field . due to its large coupling constant",
    "the meson synchrotron emission is @xmath13 times stronger than the usual photon synchrotron radiation .",
    "ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1965a , b ) calculated the intensity of @xmath14 emission by a proton in a given magnetic field . at that time",
    ", however , they could hardly find the astrophysical sites to which their formulae could be applied .    in the present paper",
    "we propose that grb central engines could be a viable site for strong meson emission .",
    "waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) proposed that high energy neutrinos with @xmath15 are produced by photomeson interactions on shock - accelerated protons in the relativistic fireball ( rees & mszros 1992 ) .",
    "pacsyski & xu ( 1994 ) suggested that charged pions , which are produced in pp collisions when the kinetic energy of the fireball is dissipated through internal collisions within the ejecta , produce a burst of @xmath16 neutrinos .",
    "our proposed process of meson production is different from these two which can operate without magnetic fields .",
    "the very rapid variability time scale , @xmath17 , of many grbs implies that each sub - burst reflects the intrinsic primary energy release from the central engine ( sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the length scale of the central engine is estimated to be @xmath18 .",
    "the batse detector on board of compton gamma - ray observatory found the shortest burst of a duration of 5ms with substructure on scale of 0.2ms ( bhat et al .",
    "1992 ) . accumulated batse data ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) confirmed that more than 25% of total events are short ( @xmath19 ) bursts .",
    "therefore , if the central engines of grbs were the compact stellar objects like neutron stars or rotating black holes associated with strong magnetic fields , relativistic protons or heavy nuclei would trigger meson synchrotron emission whose decay products could provide several observational signals even before the hidden explosion energy is transported to the radiation in the later stage of a relativistic fireball .",
    "we extend the previous treatment of @xmath14 emission of ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1965a , b ) to several kinds of neutral and charged mesons , which couple to a nucleon through scalar or vector type interaction , in a manner somewhat different from theirs .",
    "if the produced mesons are @xmath14s or heavier mesons which have main decay modes onto @xmath14s , they produce high energy photons which are immediately converted to lower energy @xmath9s or @xmath20 pairs through @xmath21 or @xmath22 ( erber 1966 ) for their large optical depth in strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , if they are the charged mesons like @xmath4s , decay modes are very different and result in more interesting consequences .",
    "since the source emitters of charged nuclei are accelerated to high energy ( hillas 1984 ) to some extent , very high energy neutrinos are produced by @xmath23 or its mirror conjugate process for the similar mechanism as proposed by waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) .",
    "these neutrinos could be a signature for strong meson emission from the grb central engines and would be detected in the very early phase of the short grbs .",
    "we formulate the meson synchrotron emission in the next section , and the calculated results are shown and discussed in  3 .",
    "we follow the established semi - classical treatment ( peskin & schroeder 1995 , itzykson & zuber 1980 ) of synchrotron emission of the quantum fields interacting with classical source current in strong external fields . in our present study",
    "the meson field is second quantized , while the nucleons are not and obey classical motion .",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath14 synchrotron emission by a proton was first derived by ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1965a , b ) and it is give by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath26 ( sakurai 1967 ) , @xmath27 is the energy of the emitted pion , and @xmath28 is the lorentz factor , @xmath29 , of the rotating proton in a given magnetic field .",
    "@xmath30 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the rest masses of proton and @xmath14 meson , and the parameter @xmath36 , which characterizes the synchrotron emission , is determined by the proton energy and the strength of magnetic field as @xmath37 with @xmath38 . in the above equations ,",
    "variable @xmath39 is introduced for mathematical simplicity , @xmath40 .",
    "since the available energy of the pion satisfies @xmath41 , the corresponding variable range of @xmath39 is @xmath42 .    applying the same treatment to vector mesons",
    ", we extensively obtain the energy spectrum of @xmath5 meson synchrotron emission @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath45 . the function @xmath32 is defined by eq .",
    "( 2 ) by replacing @xmath46 with @xmath5 meson mass @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . note that one can easily get the expression for photon synchrotron radiation in the limit of @xmath49 by replacing the strong coupling constant @xmath25 with the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath50 .",
    "let us make a short remark on our classical treatment .",
    "when the proton energy is very high or the external magnetic field is strong , i.e. @xmath57 , the quantum effects not only in the meson field but in the source nucleon current may not be negligible . in the case of photon synchrotron radiation , quantum effects",
    "were carefully studied ( erber 1966 ) , and semi - classical treatment was found to be a good approximation to the exact solution within a few percent . in our treatment , the prefactor in eq .",
    "( 5 ) @xmath65{3}}{16\\pi}\\gamma(5/3)\\right ) \\approx 0.583 $ ] . taking the limit of @xmath49 and @xmath66 ,",
    "( 5 ) is applied to photon synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is shown ( erber 1966 ) that this factor should be 0.5563 in fully quantum mechanical calculation .",
    "it therefore is expected to hold true for the hadron processes as well .",
    "figure 1a shows a comparison between the calculated spectra of scalar @xmath14 meson emission and @xmath9 synchrotron radiation . since usov ( 1992 ) , kluniak & ruderman ( 1998 ) , and pacsyski ( 1998 ) suggested strong magnetic fields of order @xmath11 , which are presumed to associate with neutron stars or black holes of the grb central engines , we here take @xmath67 . the observed lorentz factor of the fireball is @xmath12 , which indicates that the energy of charged particles is at least @xmath68 .",
    "although the acceleration mechanism in grbs is still unknown , there are suggestions ( milgrom & usov 1995 ) that the grbs associate with uhecrs .",
    "six events of uhecrs beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff energy @xmath69 ( hill & schramm 1985 ) have been detected by agasa group ( takeda et al .",
    "we therefore vary the proton energy from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "all calculated spectra cut off sharply at incident proton energy @xmath72 . as seen in this figure ,",
    "the intensity of @xmath14 emission for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which correspond respectively to @xmath75 and @xmath76 , is @xmath77 times stronger than that of @xmath9 radiation in high energy parts of the spectra .",
    "this reflects the different coupling constants , @xmath78 .",
    "very sharp declination of the @xmath14 spectra at lower energy arises from the integral in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for finite pion mass because @xmath58 for @xmath59 , which is a good approximation in this energy region where @xmath79 .",
    "figure 1b shows comparison between the calculated spectra of @xmath5 meson emission and @xmath9 synchrotron radiation . in this figure",
    "both spectra look very similar to each other , except for the absolute intensity and the sharp declination of low energy spectra due to finite @xmath5 meson mass .",
    "this is because the interactions between @xmath5 meson and proton and between photon and proton are of vector type . for the proton energies above @xmath15",
    "the intensity of @xmath5 meson emission is roughly a thousand times larger than that of @xmath9 synchrotron radiation , reflecting again its stronger coupling constant .",
    "figure 2 displays the calculated total intensities of synchrotron emission of @xmath14 and @xmath5 mesons as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "these are the integrated spectra shown in figs .",
    "1a & 1b over available meson energies .",
    "the total intensity of @xmath9 synchrotron radiation is also shown in this figure .",
    "@xmath80 exceeds @xmath81 at @xmath82 , and @xmath83 exceeds @xmath81 at @xmath84 . both @xmath80 and @xmath83",
    "decrease exponentially with decreasing @xmath36 due to their finite masses .",
    "( see the asymptotic forms at @xmath60 in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . )",
    "this sharp declination of @xmath83 takes place at higher @xmath36 than @xmath80 because @xmath5 meson mass is larger than pion mass .",
    "@xmath83 resembles @xmath81 at @xmath85 , except that the intensity is a thousand times different from each other , reflecting that both @xmath5 meson and photon have the same vector type coupling to proton with different coupling constatnts , @xmath78 .",
    "a nucleon strongly couples to @xmath4 as well as @xmath14 field .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is charge independent and @xmath86 ( sakurai 1967 ) .",
    "the initial state @xmath87 in both @xmath88 and @xmath89 processes is identical .",
    "the difference comes from the final states : proton and @xmath90 couple to external magnetic field , but neutron and @xmath14 do not .",
    "( neutron has too small magnetic moment . )",
    "when we describe these processes in quantum mechanics , we should use wave functions from the solution of dirac and klein - gordon equations for the nucleon and the pion separately .",
    "however , final states are more or less the same for the same charge state , aside from the different masses . these might not change the reaction amplitiudes by many orders at ultra - relativistic energies where the rest mass is neglected .",
    "note that the conjugate processes @xmath91 and @xmath92 can also occur when a composite nucleus like @xmath93 orbits in the strong magnetic fields .",
    "heavy mesons including @xmath5 meson have several appreciable branching ratios for the decay onto @xmath4 .",
    "let us discuss what kinds of observational signals they may make .",
    "we assume that some fraction of @xmath94 of the gravitational or magnetic field energy is released by some unknown mechanism operating at the grb central engine during very short time duration , @xmath95 , of the first sub - burst .",
    "we also assume that an appreciable part of this energy is deposited into the relativistic motion of the material leading to uhecrs . in a somewhat different context ,",
    "waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) proposed that the photomeson production in the ejecta of the fireball would make a burst of @xmath15 neutrinos .",
    "although their proposed mechanism of meson production is completely different from ours , we can apply similar discussion on the physical consequence of @xmath4 decay . extending our previous discussions of @xmath14 in fig . 2 to @xmath4",
    ", we expect that a thousand times stronger intensity of high energy neutrinos than the photons can be produced universally at @xmath96 from @xmath23 and its mirror conjugate process .",
    "since neutrinos can escape from the ambient matter , these neutrinos could be a clear signature showing strong meson synchrotron emission near the central engines of grbs associated with extremely strong magnetic fields .",
    "the neutron emerging from @xmath88 inherits almost all proton energy and can escape from the region of strong magnetic field .",
    "if there is not a dense shell surrounding the central engine , it travels @xmath97 before beta decay .",
    "this process may also produce a very high energy neutrino . the generic picture of grbs ( mszros & rees 1993 , piran 1999 ) suggets that a baryon mass @xmath98 is involved in a single explosion .",
    "if this is the case , such amount of baryon mass is huge enough to stop almost all neutrons before running through the ambient matter .",
    "if the central engines are neutron stars or black holes , the material ejected from these compact objects contains heavy nuclei such as oxygen and iron because these are the products from evolved massive stars . therefore , meson emission from a heavy nucleus as well as from a proton is worth being considered .",
    "let us consider a nucleus of total energy @xmath99 , mass number a , and charge @xmath100 , in a magnetic field of strength @xmath101 .",
    "the energy of each nucleon is @xmath102 .",
    "when the strength of the effective magnetic field is @xmath103 , the orbital trajectory of a proton is the same as the trajectory of the nucleus in the magnetic field @xmath101 .",
    "the intensity of @xmath14 emission by the nucleus should be the sum of each nucleonic contribution provided that the synchrotron emission is incoherent .",
    "thus the total intensity is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the intensity of @xmath14 emission by the nucleon of energy @xmath106 in magnetic field @xmath107 .",
    "note that both proton and neutron emit @xmath14 .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath108 for @xmath93 as a function of total energy @xmath99 with a fixed magnetic field of @xmath109 .",
    "the sharp declination of @xmath110 takes place at higher energy than @xmath111 because each nucleon in @xmath93 has effectively smaller energy than a single proton .",
    "there is now more motivation to study the grbs in association with uhecrs .",
    "it is highly desirable to proceed with a project like orbiting wide - angle light - collectors ( owl ) , in order to detect ultra - relativistic neutrinos from grbs for finding the true nature of the central engines .",
