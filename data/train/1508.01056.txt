    "the concept of _ network communicability _ , first introduced by estrada and hatano in @xcite , is being increasingly recognized as an important metric in the structural analysis of networks .",
    "the communicability between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as the @xmath2th entry in the exponential of the adjacency matrix of the network ( or some scaled version of it ) .",
    "this choice can be justified on graph - theoretic grounds based on the concept of walks in a graph , and also from a statistical physics point of view if we regard a network as a system of coupled oscillators and consider the associated thermal green s function @xcite . to date , there have been a number of applications of communicability to the analysis of real - world complex networks , a few of which are surveyed in @xcite .    in @xcite a new node centrality measure",
    "was introduced based on the notion of _ total communicability _ , which measures how easily a given node communicates with all the nodes in the network . as pointed out in @xcite , this centrality measure is closely related to the notion of _ subgraph centrality _",
    "@xcite , while being much easier to compute in the case of large networks . in @xcite",
    "it was also proposed to use the sum of all the total node communicabilities , possibly normalized by the number of nodes , as a _ global _ measure of how effective the network is at propagating information among its nodes .",
    "this global index , referred to as _ total network communicability _",
    ", was further shown in @xcite to provide a good measure of the connectivity and robustness of complex networks , while being much faster to compute than existing metrics ( such as the closely related _ free energy _ @xcite and _ natural connectivity _ @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the cost of estimating the total network communicability using lanczos - type methods scales linearly in the size of the graph for many types of networks @xcite .",
    "given that high communicability is often a highly desirable feature ( especially in the case of certain infrastructure , information , and social networks ) it is then natural to ask whether it is possible to design networks which are at the same time highly sparse ( in the sense of low average degree ) and yet have high total communicability .",
    "( this problem is analogous to that of constructing good expander graphs , see @xcite . ) in @xcite we considered the problem of modifying an existing sparse network so as to cause the total network communicability to change in some desired way .",
    "the modification can be the addition of a missing edge , the deletion of an existing edge , or the rewiring of an existing edge .",
    "the goal could be to increase the total communicability of the network as much as possible ( or nearly so ) , or to sparsify the network while minimizing the drop in the value of the total communicability , subject to constraints on the number of edge modifications allowed . in @xcite ,",
    "several fast and effective heuristics have been developed that achieve the desired goal .",
    "a serious limitation of the notion of total communicability is that it is not well suited to deal with directed networks , and indeed all the above mentioned papers deal exclusively with undirected networks .",
    "the main reason is that in a directed graph each node plays two roles , that of broadcaster and that of receiver of information .",
    "it is clear that a single index can not discriminate between these two forms of communication . in this paper , building in part on the ideas in @xcite , we define two new measures of total network communicability , which quantify how easily information is propagated on a given directed network when the two fundamental modes of communication ( broadcasting and receiving ) have both to be accounted for .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the edge modification criteria in @xcite from the undirected to the directed case , using the newly introduced communicability indices as the objective functions .    examples of real - world directed networks include various information and citation networks , such as corpora of documents linked to each other by directed edges , for examples hyperlinks between web pages or in - line references between wikipedia entries . in such networks",
    ", one may want to delete edges that contribute little to the overall authoritativeness of the network .",
    "in other cases , one may want to add edges from a hub to other nodes so as to increase the overall efficiency of the network in leading to authoritative documents .",
    "it is therefore of interest to introduce criteria for edge selection aimed at ( approximately ) optimizing the global communicability properties of directed networks .",
    "a few other authors have previously considered heuristics for edge manipulation in directed networks . in @xcite ,",
    "edge modification criteria are introduced for tuning the _ synchronizability _ of a network , a property of interest in many settings . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have considered the potential impact of edge modification on epidemic dynamics on contact networks .",
    "it is quite possible that our edge selection criteria may find application in these contexts .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains some background notions about digraphs , the singular value decomposition , and network centrality measures .",
    "the new total communicability indices for digraphs are introduced in section 3 .",
    "the edge updating / downdating problem is described in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we introduce the proposed heuristics for edge manipulation , and in section 6 we discuss the result of numerical tests ( including timings ) using four real - world directed networks .",
    "conclusive remarks are found in section 7 .",
    "in this section we recall a few definitions and notations associated with graphs .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph with @xmath4 nodes and @xmath5 edges ( or links ) .",
    "if for all @xmath6 such that @xmath7 then also @xmath8 , the graph is said to be _ undirected _ , as its edges can be traversed without following any prescribed `` direction . '' on the other hand , if this condition does not hold , namely if there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , then the network is said to be _ directed_. a directed graph is commonly referred to as a _",
    "digraph_. if @xmath7 in a digraph , we will write @xmath11 . as for the undirected case , an unweighted digraph can be represented by means of a binary matrix @xmath12 whose entries @xmath13 are nonzero if and only if @xmath7 .",
    "an ordered pair @xmath14 will be called a _ virtual edge_.    every node @xmath15 in a digraph has two types of degree , namely the _ in - degree _ and the _ out - degree _ ; the first , denoted by @xmath16 , counts the number of edges of the form @xmath17 , i.e. , the number of nodes in @xmath18 from which it is possible to reach @xmath0 in one step . the _ out - degree _ , on the other hand , counts the number of nodes that can be reached from @xmath0 in one step , i.e. , the number of edges of the form @xmath19 , and is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the degrees of a node @xmath0 can be computed as the @xmath0th entries of the following two vectors : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the vector of all ones and the superscript `` @xmath23 '' denotes transposition .    a _ walk _ of length @xmath24 is a sequence of ( possibly repeated ) nodes @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 ; a walk is said to be _ closed _ if @xmath28 .",
    "a _ path _ is a walk with no repeated nodes .",
    "a digraph is said to be _ strongly connected _ if every two nodes in the network are connected through a path of finite length , while it is said to be _ weakly connected _ if this property holds when the directionality of the links is disregarded .    unless otherwise stated , every digraph in this paper is _ simple _",
    ", i.e. , unweighted , weakly connected , and without self - loops or multi - edges .",
    "let @xmath29 be a _ singular value decomposition _",
    "( svd ) of the adjacency matrix @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath31 is diagonal and its diagonal entries @xmath32 are the _ singular values _ of @xmath30 .",
    "these elements are non - negative and ordered as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rank of @xmath30 .",
    "the matrices @xmath35 are orthogonal and @xmath36 $ ] contains the _ left singular vectors _ of @xmath30 , while @xmath37 $ ] contains the _ right singular vectors_. as is well known , @xmath38 is uniquely determined by @xmath30 but @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not . given an svd of @xmath30 , the corresponding _ compact singular value decomposition _ ( csvd ) of the matrix @xmath30 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42\\in{\\mathbb}{r}^{n\\times r}$ ] and @xmath43\\in{\\mathbb}{r}^{n\\times r}$ ] consist of the first @xmath44 columns of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , and @xmath45 corresponds to the leading @xmath46 diagonal block of @xmath38 .",
    "let us briefly recall here a few definitions concerning the dual role every node plays in a digraph .",
    "in @xcite kleinberg stated that in directed networks there exist two types of important nodes : _ hubs _ and _ authorities_. in particular , each node can be assigned a hub score and an authority score , which quantify its ability of playing these two roles .",
    "good hubs are those nodes which better broadcast information , while good authorities are those which better receive information .",
    "these two types of importance for nodes are strongly related through a recursive definition : the importance of a node as hub is proportional to the importance as authorities of the nodes it points to .",
    "similarly , the importance of a node as authority depends on the importance as hubs of the nodes that point to it . this recursive definition is highlighted in the implementation of the hits algorithm ( see @xcite ) , which makes use of the eigenvectors corresponding to the leading eigenvalue of the symmetric matrices @xmath47 ( the _ hub matrix _ ) and @xmath48 ( the _ authority matrix _ ) to rank the nodes as hubs and authorities , respectively .",
    "( and therefore of @xmath48 ) is simple .",
    "this ensures the uniqueness ( up to scalar multiples ) of the principal eigenvectors of these matrices , and therefore of the hub and authority rankings .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and to @xcite for a discussion of this issue . ]    using the svd or the csvd of the adjacency matrix , it easily follows that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the vector containing the hub scores is @xmath51 while the vector containing the authority scores is @xmath52 . by the perron ",
    "frobenius theorem @xcite , from the non - negativity and irreducibility of the hub and authority matrices it follows that these principal eigenvectors can be chosen so as to have positive components .",
    "hence , @xmath53 will be called the _ hub vector _ and the vector @xmath54 will be called the _ authority vector_.    the powers of the hub and authority matrices are related to the number of particular types of walks in the digraph . following @xcite ,",
    "we define an _ alternating walk of length @xmath24 starting with an out - edge _ as a list of nodes @xmath55 such that there exists an edge @xmath56 if @xmath57 is odd and an edge @xmath58 if @xmath57 is even .",
    "hence , an alternating walk starting with an out - edge has the form @xmath59 similarly , an _ alternating walk of length @xmath24 starting with an in - edge _ is a list of nodes @xmath55 such that @xmath60 i.e. , such that there exists an edge @xmath56 if @xmath57 is even and an edge @xmath61 otherwise .",
    "it is well known that the entries of powers of the adjacency matrix of a graph can be used to count the number of walks of a certain length in the network .",
    "similarly , it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that @xmath62_{ij}$ ] ( where there are @xmath24 matrices being multiplied ) counts the number of alternating walks of length @xmath24 , starting with an out - edge , from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 , whereas @xmath63_{ij}$ ] ( where there are @xmath24 matrices being multiplied ) counts the number of alternating walks of length @xmath24 , starting with an in - edge , from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 .",
    "thus , @xmath64_{ij}$ ] and @xmath65_{ij}$ ] count the number of alternating walks of length @xmath66 .    in the next section",
    ", we will show how to use these quantities to define two global measures of how effectively the nodes in a digraph exchange information .",
    "in @xcite a global measure of how easily information is diffused across an ( undirected ) network has been defined in terms of the matrix exponential of the adjacency matrix .",
    "more in detail , recalling that the entries of the matrix exponential count the total number of walks of any length between two nodes weighting walks of length @xmath24 by a factor @xmath67 , the _ total network communicability _ has been defined as the sum of all the entries of this matrix : @xmath68_{ij } = { \\bf 1}^t e^a { \\bf 1 } , \\quad e^a = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!}a^k.\\ ] ] this quantity , possibly normalized by @xmath69 , has been empirically shown to provide a good measure of how effectively the information flows along the network and of how well connected an undirected network is ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let now @xmath30 be the adjacency matrix of a directed graph . in analogy with the undirected case , we can consider the total network communicability ( [ tc_undir ] ) . in principle",
    ", this quantity ( possibly normalized by @xmath69 ) gives us an idea of how efficient the network is , globally , at diffusing information .",
    "however , by following this approach we would be completely disregarding the twofold nature of nodes , which is one of the main features of digraphs .    to better capture the dual behavior of nodes , we introduce two new global indices of communicability defined in terms of functions of the hub and authority matrices .    [ def : ditc ]",
    "let @xmath30 be the adjacency matrix of a simple digraph and let @xmath70 be a function defined on the spectrum of @xmath47 .",
    "the total hub @xmath71-communicability of the digraph is defined as @xmath72 similarly , the total authority @xmath71-communicability of the digraph is defined as @xmath73    the motivation for using these quadratic forms as total communicability indices is that they exploit the recursive definition that relates hubs and authorities in a directed network .",
    "assume that the function @xmath71 can be expressed as a power series of the form @xmath74 then , an easy computation shows that the total hub @xmath71-communicability , can be described in terms of the in - degree vector and of the authority matrix as @xmath75 thus highlighting the fact that the overall ability of nodes to broadcast information depends on their ability of receiving it .",
    "note that due to the nonnegativity assumption on the coefficients in ( [ eq : ps ] ) , @xmath76 is an inherently nonnegative quantity .",
    "analogous computations carried out on the total authority @xmath71-communicability show that this index can be completely described in terms of the out - degree vector and of the hub matrix : @xmath77 thus showing that the overall ability of nodes to receive information depends on how well they are able to broadcast it .",
    "note that @xmath78 is , again , always nonnegative .",
    "we stress that the total hub and authority @xmath71-communicabilities are invariant under graph isomorphism .",
    "indeed , let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be two isomorphic graphs with associated adjacency matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then there exists a permutation matrix @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 similarly , @xmath86    in this paper we will focus on the total hub and authority @xmath71-communicabilities when the function @xmath87 is used in the definition .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath88 may seem unusual ; however , we argue that this choice is the most natural one if one wants to `` translate '' the idea of total communicability to the case of digraphs .",
    "indeed , in the undirected case the total communicability was defined as the sum of all the entries of the matrix exponential .",
    "this index counts all the walks of any length taking place in the network , weighting walks of length @xmath24 by a factor @xmath67 . in the case of a digraph",
    ", we need to count all the alternating walks , again penalizing longer walks .",
    "this is accomplished by taking @xmath89 ; for this choice of @xmath71 we obtain the _ total hub communicability _ as @xmath90 and , similarly , the _ total authority communicability _ as    @xmath91    a further justification for the choice of the function @xmath88 comes from considering the following construction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath92 be the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph @xmath93 obtained from the original digraph represented by @xmath30 .",
    "this graph has @xmath94 nodes forming the set @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the original set of nodes and @xmath97 is a set of copies of the nodes in @xmath3 .",
    "the edges between the elements in @xmath98 are undirected and @xmath99 with @xmath15 and @xmath100 if and only if @xmath7 in the original digraph .",
    "note that in the bipartite graph the first @xmath69 nodes contained in @xmath96 can be seen as the original nodes of the digraph when they play their role of broadcasters of information , while the @xmath69 copies contained in @xmath101 represent the original nodes in their role of receivers .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the eigenvector of @xmath102 corresponding to the leading eigenvalue @xmath103 is the vector @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath87 follows from the next result .",
    "* proposition 1 ) let @xmath102 be as in and let @xmath29 be an svd of @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath105    an important feature of this matrix is that its entries are nonnegative .",
    "thus , these quantities can be used to describe the importance of nodes and how well they communicate when they are acting as broadcasters or receivers of information in the graph  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the entries of the two diagonal blocks @xmath106 and @xmath107 provide centrality and communicability indices for nodes and pairs of nodes when they are all seen as playing the same role in the network .",
    "more in detail , the diagonal entries of the first diagonal block give the centralities for the nodes in the original network when they are seen as broadcasters of information ( hubs ) .",
    "likewise , the diagonal of the second block contains the centralities for the nodes in their role of receivers ( authorities ) .",
    "similarly to the off - diagonal entries of the matrix exponential of an undirected graphs , the off - diagonal entries of these diagonal blocks measure how well two nodes , both acting as broadcasters ( resp . , receivers ) ,",
    "exchange information .",
    "as for the off - diagonal blocks in  , they contain information concerning how nodes exchange information when one node is playing the role of broadcaster ( resp . , receiver ) and the other is acting as a receiver ( resp . ,",
    "broadcaster ) .",
    "thus , the total hub communicability and total authority communicability defined as @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , account for the overall ability of the network of exchanging information when all its nodes are playing the same role of broadcasters ( @xmath110 ) or receivers ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the main goal of this work is to develop heuristics that can be used to add / remove edges from a digraph in order to tune the total hub and/or authority communicability . in particular , we will call _ update _ of @xmath14 the addition of this virtual edge to the network ; we want to perform this operation in such a way that this addition increases as much as possible the quantities of interest .",
    "note that , due to the nonnegativity condition in ( [ eq : ps ] ) , the addition of an edge can only increase the total communicabilities @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the operation of removing an edge from the network will be referred to as the _ downdate _ of an edge .",
    "our aim is to select the edge to be removed in such a way that the target functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 are not penalized too much , i.e. , their values do not drop significantly as edges are removed .",
    "both these operations can be described as rank - one modifications of the adjacency matrix @xmath30 of the digraph @xmath18 or , equivalently , as rank - two modifications of the adjacency matrix @xmath102 of the associated bipartite graph @xmath114 .",
    "we first introduce some edge centrality measures that can be used to rank the ( virtual ) edges in the digraph ; we then use the derived rankings to select which modifications to perform .",
    "more in detail , a virtual edge having a large centrality is considered important and thus its addition is expected to highly enhance the total communicabilities . on the other hand , we will remove edges that have a low ranking , since they are not expected to carry a lot of information ; thus , their removal is not expected to heavily penalize the hub and authorities communicabilities of the network .",
    "the resulting updating and downdating strategies will be similar in spirit to those adopted in the undirected case @xcite .",
    "however , as explained in more detail in the next subsection , we can not simply apply the heuristics in @xcite to the bipartite graph @xmath114 , since doing so could lead to possible loss of structure .",
    "in this section we will describe two different ways of tackling the problem of selecting @xmath115 edge modifications to be performed on the network in order to tune the communicability indices @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "first we describe how to rank the edges . a priori , there are two natural approaches .",
    "indeed , given the definitions of communicabilities in terms of the function @xmath87 , we can either work on the matrix @xmath102 or on the original adjacency matrix @xmath30 . in the first case",
    ", we would adapt to the matrix @xmath102 the techniques developed for the undirected case which performed best according to the results in @xcite , taking into account the need to preserve the zero - nonzero block structure of @xmath102 .",
    "the second approach , on the other hand , requires the introduction of new edge centrality measures specially developed for the directed case .",
    "we will show that the new edge centrality measures for digraphs allow us to develop heuristics that perform as well as or better than the techniques for undirected graphs applied to @xmath102 .",
    "we want to stress here that the set of ( virtual ) edges among which we select the modifications is the same in both cases , since one wants to preserve the antidiagonal block structure ( [ eq : a_bipartite ] ) of @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , if a new edge were to destroy the structure , it could not be `` translated '' into a new directed edge for the original digraph .      in the following",
    ", we will briefly recall the edge centrality measures introduced in @xcite that showed the best performance .",
    "these will be used on @xmath102 to tackle the updating and downdating problems .",
    "let @xmath116 be the adjacency matrix of a simple , undirected graph .",
    "we call the _ edge eigenvector centrality _ of the ( virtual ) edge @xmath2 the quantity : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the @xmath0th entry of the perron vector @xmath119 of the matrix @xmath116 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we call _ edge total communicability centrality _ of @xmath2 the quantity : @xmath120    let @xmath121 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath116 .",
    "it has been pointed out that , when the spectral gap @xmath122 is large enough , then these two centrality measures provide very similar rankings , especially when the attention is restricted to the top edges ; on the other hand , different rankings may be obtained when the gap is small @xcite .",
    "we now want to define two new edge centrality measures that take into account the directionality of links and that can be computed by directly working on the unsymmetric adjacency matrix @xmath30 .    in @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that one of the main factors in the evolution of the total communicability is the dominant eigenvalue @xmath123 of the matrix involved in its computation .",
    "this is clear since for an undirected graph with adjacency matrix @xmath30 the total communicability can be expressed as @xmath124 hence the dominant contribution to @xmath125 comes from the first term of the sum .",
    "thus , heuristics that increase the spectral radius of @xmath30 as much as possible will likely be effective also when the goal is to increase the total communicability as much as possible .",
    "for example , one of the methods found in @xcite to have the best performance relies on the edge eigenvector centrality , which is indeed directly connected to the change that occurs in the magnitude of the leading eigenvalue ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "transferring this idea to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , it follows that we want to define ( if possible ) an edge centrality measure that allows us to control the change in the leading singular value of @xmath30 , which corresponds to the square root of the leading eigenvalue of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "[ prop : eig_change ] let @xmath30 be the adjacency matrix of a graph .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the hub and authority vectors , respectively .",
    "let @xmath126 be the leading singular value of @xmath30 .",
    "consider the adjacency matrix of the graph obtained after the addition of the virtual edge @xmath2 : @xmath127 .",
    "then the leading eigenvalue @xmath128 of the new hub and authority matrices satisfies @xmath129 the inequality is strict if @xmath47 is irreducible",
    ".    moreover , let @xmath130 denote the adjacency matrix obtained after the removal of the existing edge @xmath11 .",
    "then the leading eigenvalue @xmath131 of the new hub and authority matrices satisfies @xmath132 the first inequality is strict if @xmath133 is irreducible .    using the rayleigh  ritz theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) we get : @xmath134 similarly , by working on the authority matrix one gets : @xmath135 from these inequalities , and from basic facts from perron  frobenius theory , the conclusion easily follows .",
    "similar arguments can be used to prove .    relations   and motivate the following definition .    [",
    "def : ehits ] let @xmath30 be the adjacency matrix of a directed graph .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be its hits hub and authority vectors , respectively .",
    "then the edge hits centrality of the existing / virtual edge @xmath2 is defined as @xmath136    notice that when @xmath30 is symmetric this definition reduces to that of edge eigenvector centrality : @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the eigenvector associated with the leading eigenvalue of @xmath30 .",
    "[ rem : orientation ] inequalities   and   and , consequently , definition [ def : ehits ] suggest that there is a  prescribed direction \" one has to follow when introducing a new edge centrality measure .",
    "indeed , it is required to use the centrality as broadcaster for the source node @xmath0 and the centrality as receiver for the target node @xmath1 when evaluating the importance of the ( virtual ) edge @xmath11 .",
    "this observation confirms a natural intuition and motivates the usage of this same `` orientation '' in all our definitions and methods ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : heuristics ] ) .    the next edge centrality measure we want to define relies on the use of the total communicability of nodes .",
    "recall that in the case of an undirected network represented by the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath116 , the total communicability of node @xmath0 is defined as @xmath139 .",
    "this quantity describes how well node @xmath0 communicates with the whole network . as discussed in section [ sec : tc ] , this centrality measure is well defined for any adjacency matrix , in particular for the adjacency matrices of digraphs , and indeed the row and column sums of @xmath140 do provide in some cases meaningful measures of how well nodes broadcast information ( row sums of @xmath140 ) and how good they are at receiving information ( column sums of @xmath140 ) .",
    "however , the expressions describing these quantities do not provide information on the alternating walks taking place in the digraph and , thus , miss a crucial feature of communication in real - world directed networks .",
    "for this reason , we introduce here new definitions for the total communicabilities of nodes which can be shown to be directly connected to their twofold nature . in order to do so , we make use of the concept of _ generalized matrix function _",
    "first introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath141 be a matrix of rank @xmath44 , and let @xmath142 be a function such that @xmath143 exists for all @xmath144 , so that the matrix function @xmath145 is well defined .",
    "following @xcite , we define the generalized matrix function @xmath146 as @xmath147    it is easy to check that @xmath148    these equalities show that a generalized matrix function can be expressed in terms of @xmath30 and either @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the entries of @xmath149  and hence its row / column sums  can be used as meaningful measures of importance in the directed case , _ provided that they are all non - negative_.    it turns out that , in general , this is not the case for the generalized matrix exponential .",
    "indeed , consider for example the generalized matrix exponential of the adjacency matrix @xmath150 associated with the digraph in fig .",
    "1 . it turns out that its @xmath151 and @xmath152 entries are negative , and thus these quantities can not be interpreted as communicability / centrality measures .",
    "[ fig : ex ]     if we instead consider the generalized hyperbolic sine : @xmath153 we have that this matrix corresponds to the top right block of the matrix @xmath154 ; indeed , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : expma_bipartite ] ) as @xmath155 hence , the entries of @xmath156 are all non - negative , and can be used to quantify how well nodes communicate when they are playing different roles .",
    "more precisely , reasoning in terms of alternating walks shows that the @xmath2th entry of this matrix describes how well node @xmath0 exchanges information with node @xmath1 when the first is playing the role of hub and the latter that of authority . using this generalized matrix function",

    "similarly , @xmath161 accounts for the ability of node @xmath1 as an authority to receive information from all the nodes in the graph , when they are acting as broadcasters of information .. ] this feature highlights the fact that these definitions are better suited than @xmath162 and @xmath163 when it comes to working on digraphs .",
    "this result is summarized in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : hanodetc ] let @xmath30 be the adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath164 .",
    "the total hub communicability of node @xmath15 can be written as    @xmath165    similarly , the total authority communicability of node @xmath166 can be expressed as @xmath167    using the first equality in   one gets that : @xmath168 which proves the first equality of  . to prove the second",

    "the proof of   goes along the same lines and is thus omitted .    before proceeding with the introduction of the associated edge centrality measure ,",
    "we want to show with a small example that these measures of hub and authority centrality are indeed informative .",
    "consider as an example the graph in fig .",
    "it is intuitive that node @xmath172 should be given the highest score both as hub and as authority by any reasonable centrality measure .",
    "consequently , the authority scores for nodes @xmath173 and @xmath174 should be the same and higher than that of node @xmath175 because these nodes are directly pointed to from node @xmath172 , which is the best hub in the graph . for a similar reason , nodes @xmath175 and @xmath174",
    "should be ranked higher than node @xmath173 when considering a hub score , since they directly point to node @xmath172 , which is the most important authority .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similar conclusions can be drawn when considering the results for the downdating problem , although the differences among the techniques are less pronounced ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cc_down][fig : cit - hepth_down ] and table  [ tab : time_dwdt ] ) .",
    "indeed , the results shown confirm the effectiveness of the techniques based on the edge hits and total communicability centralities and of their variants which do not require the recomputation of the rankings . as in the case of the updating problem , the results returned by these two methods essentially reproduce those obtained when working on @xmath102 using the heuristics b : eig(.no ) and b : tc(.no ) .",
    "the methods eig(.no ) and tc(.no ) perform no better ( and in some cases worse ) than gtc(.no ) and hits(.no ) , while b : deg is usually outperformed by b : eig(.no ) or b : tc(.no ) .",
    "concerning the timings , if we compare the results in tables  [ tab : time_updt ] and  [ tab : time_dwdt ] we can see that the values in table  [ tab : time_updt ] are in general higher that those in table  [ tab : time_dwdt ] .",
    "this is easily understood in view of what we observed before , if one compares the number of virtual edges @xmath176 with the number of edges @xmath177 in each network in the dataset ( see table  [ tab : dataset ] ) .    while we do not provide a formal assessment of the computational cost of the various heuristics ,",
    "arguments similar to those found in @xcite indicate that the cost of the more efficient heuristics can be expected to scale approximately like @xmath178 or @xmath179 with the number of nodes @xmath69 .    in conclusion , by considering the overall performance of the methods and their cost ( in terms of timings ) , we find that the best criteria for our updating / downdating goals are the methods hits(.no ) and gtc(.no ) . besides these",
    ", satisfactory results may also be obtained using b : eig(.no ) or b : tc(.no ) . from the timings in tables  [",
    "tab : time_updt ] and  [ tab : time_dwdt ] we can deduce that the heuristics hits(.no ) are in general slightly faster than b : eig(.no ) and may thus be preferred .",
    "concerning whether it is better to use gtc(.no ) or b : tc(.no ) , we anticipate that the first will be preferrable when used in conjunction with fast algorithms for the approximation of bilinear forms involving generalized matrix functions .",
    "in this work we have extended the notion of total network communicability to directed graphs , and developed heuristics for manipulating an existing directed network so as to enhance its communicability properties . in doing",
    "so we made use of the concept of alternating walks , which allows us to take into account the dual role played by each node in a digraph , namely , receiver and broadcaster of information .",
    "this in turn led us in a natural way to the ( rather overlooked ) concept of generalized matrix function , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "as shown in the paper , this concept allows one to express various communicability measures for digraphs in a compact form .",
    "our computational results indicate that the heuristics which take into account the dual role of nodes in directed networks tend to be preferable to those that do not .",
    "we also showed that these heuristics are very fast in practice .",
    "future work will address computational issues for large - scale networks ( in particular , fast algorithms for estimating the row and column sums of generalized matrix functions ) .",
    "another avenue for future work is the extension of the techniques in this paper and in @xcite to weighted graphs .",
    "we also plan to investigate the use of our heuristics to tune other network properties .",
