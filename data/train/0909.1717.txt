    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the theory of the strong interaction .",
    "the perturbative regime , applying to processes with large momentum transfer , is theoretically calculable and has been extensively tested  @xcite . on the other hand , the regime in which quarks and gluons interact with modest momenta and with an effective coupling constant that is too large for perturbation theory to apply , can not be reliably calculated by analytic methods .",
    "lattice gauge theory is one first principle approach which can be used .",
    "it predicts the existence of a new state of strongly - interacting matter at high energy density .",
    "this state has now been observed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite .",
    "many interesting features of this new state of matter produced in these collisions have been observed . in this paper",
    "we focus on a new phenomenon which we refer to as local strong parity (  ) violation . it is well known that the strong interaction conserves parity  meaning that strong interactions do not lead to reactions which produce a finite expectation value for any parity odd ( changing sign under parity transformation ) observable .",
    "the best evidence for this comes from experiments which set limits on the electric dipole moment of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "these experiments show that the parameter @xmath1 whose nonzero value would describe parity violation in qcd must have magnitude less than @xmath2 .",
    "this limit effectively makes direct global parity violation unobservable in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "our measurement of a similar -odd observable is consistent with zero at the level of the experimental precision of @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the concept of local parity violation at high temperatures or in high - energy heavy - ion collisions was discussed by lee and wick @xcite and morley and schmidt  @xcite and elaborated by kharzeev et al .",
    "@xcite . in a dense highly excited state",
    ", gluon fields can produce configurations , local in space and time , which cause  , time reversal , and , via the cpt theorem ,  violating effects .",
    "these field configurations form in different ways in different events and averaged over many events they would not yield a finite expectation value for a -odd observable .",
    "each space - time region , occupied by such a configuration , is spontaneously produced with a random sign of -violation , which in the theory is determined by the gluonic field topological charge .",
    "field configurations with non - zero topological charge have a finite expectation value for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields , and the average is taken over the region occupied by the configuration . since the space time symmetries of chromodynamic fields are the same as those of electromagnetic fields , with electric field being a vector and magnetic field being a pseudovector , this region is not invariant under   ( and ) transformations .",
    "quark interactions with such topological gluonic configurations change the quark chirality leading to asymmetry in the number of left and right handed quarks : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of light quark flavors and @xmath9 is the topological charge of the gluonic configuration .",
    "thus , the gluonic field configurations with non - zero topological charge induce the local -violating effects .",
    "different aspects of an experimental detection of this phenomenon were discussed in  @xcite .    in non - central collisions such a domain can manifest itself via preferential same charge particle emission along the system angular momentum  @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "opposite charge quarks would tend to be emitted in opposite directions relative to the system angular momentum .",
    "this asymmetry in the emission of quarks would be reflected in , for example , an analogous asymmetry between positive and negative pion emission directions .",
    "this phenomenon is driven by the large ( electro- ) magnetic field produced in non - central heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "peak magnetic field strengths can reach levels of the order of @xmath10  t. the combined effect of this magnetic field ( which tends to align the magnetic moments of the quarks with the field ) and the difference in the number of quarks with positive and negative chiralities ( which is induced by their presence in a `` -violating bubble '' ) gives rise to the `` chiral magnetic effect '' .",
    "the same phenomenon can also be described in terms of induction of electric field by the ( quasi ) static magnetic field , which occurs in the presence of these topologically non - trivial vacuum solutions  @xcite .",
    "the induced electric field is parallel to the magnetic field , and leads to the charge separation in that direction .",
    "thus the charge separation can be viewed as a non - zero electric dipole moment of the system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : charge_sep ] ) .    , and that of the magnetic field @xmath11 , is indicated by an arrow . ]    depending on the sign of the domain s topological charge , positively charged particles will be preferentially emitted either along , or in the direction opposite to , the system orbital angular momentum , with negative particles flowing oppositely to the positive particles .",
    "the magnetic field and the angular momentum are normal to the plane containing the trajectories of the two colliding ions .",
    "this plane , called the reaction plane , can be found experimentally in each collision by observation of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles in that event .",
    "when two heavy ions collide with a finite impact parameter , the probability for particles to be emitted in a given azimuthal direction is often described with a fourier decomposition  @xcite : & & 1 + 2 v_1 , ( ) + 2 v_2 , ( 2)+ ... , [ eq : expansionflow ] where @xmath12 is the particle azimuthal direction relative to the reaction plane , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are coefficients accounting for the so - called directed and elliptic flow , respectively , and @xmath15 indicates the particle type .",
    "they depend on the impact parameter of the colliding nuclei , the particle type ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... ) , transverse momentum ( @xmath19 ) , and pseudorapidity ( @xmath20 ) of the produced particles . for collisions of identical nuclei",
    ", symmetry requires @xmath13 to be an odd function of rapidity and @xmath14 to be an even function of rapidity .",
    "measurements ( for a review and references , see  @xcite ) have found that , at rhic , @xmath13 is quite small at mid - rapidity ; typically , @xmath21 for @xmath22 . in contrast , @xmath14 is found to be sizable and positive . in au+au collisions at = 200 gev , for unidentified charged hadrons , @xmath14 reaches 0.25 for @xmath23  gev / c , and 0.06 when integrated over all @xmath19 .",
    "phenomenologically , the charge separation due to a domain with a given sign of the topological charge can be described by adding -odd sine terms to the fourier decomposition eq .",
    "[ eq : expansionflow ]  @xcite : & & 1 + 2 v_1 , ( ) + 2 v_2 , ( 2)+ ... + & + & 2 a_1 , ( ) + 2 a_2 , ( 2 ) + ... , [ eq : expansion ] where the @xmath24 parameters describe the -violating effect .",
    "equation  [ eq : expansion ] describes the azimuthal distribution of particles of a given transverse momentum and rapidity and , like the flow coefficients , @xmath24 coefficients depend on transverse momentum and rapidity of the particles . in addition , they depend also on the rapidity ( position ) of the domain .",
    "one expects that only particles close in rapidity to the domain position are affected . according to the theory , the signs of @xmath24 coefficients vary following the fluctuations in the domain s topological charge .",
    "if the particle distributions are averaged over many events , then these coefficients will vanish because the distributions are averaged over several domains with different signs of the topological charge .",
    "however , the effect of these domains on charged particle correlations will not vanish in this average , as discussed below . in this analysis",
    "we consider only the first harmonic coefficient @xmath25 , which is expected to account for most of the effect although higher harmonics determine the exact shape of the distribution .",
    "for brevity we will omit the harmonic number , and write @xmath26 .",
    "the index @xmath15 takes only two values , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for positively and negatively charged particles respectively .",
    "the effects of local parity violation can not be significantly observed in a single event because of the statistical fluctuations in the large number of particles , which are not affected by the -violating fields .",
    "the average of @xmath29 over many events , @xmath30 , must be zero .",
    "the observation of the effect is possible only via correlations , e.g. measuring @xmath31 with the average taken over all events in a given event sample .",
    "the correlator @xmath31 is , however , a -even quantity , and an experimental measurement of this quantity may contain contributions from effects unrelated to parity violation",
    ". the correlator @xmath31 can be in principle evaluated via measuring @xmath32 with the average in the last expression taken over all pairs of particles of a given type from a kinematic region under study and then over all events .",
    "the problem is that this form of correlator contains also a large contribution from correlations not related to the reaction plane orientation ( such correlations are not accounted for by eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] , which is a single particle distribution ) .",
    "for example , a pair of particles originating from a single jet will typically be emitted with a small azimuthal separation .",
    "these particle pairs will make a positive contribution to @xmath33 , even if the parent jets are emitted isotropically relative to the reaction plane .",
    "therefore , we separate = + b_out , [ eq : bout ] where @xmath31 is caused by parity violation and @xmath34 ( defined by this expression ) includes all other correlations projected onto the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane ( `` out of plane '' ) .",
    "the effects contributing to @xmath34 may be large and are difficult to estimate reliably .",
    "for this reason , a different correlator was proposed  @xcite : & = [ eq : obs1 ] + & -= [ eq : cossin ] + & [ + b_in ] - [ + b_out ] , [ eq : v - a ] where , similarly to eq .  [ eq : bout ] , @xmath35 is defined via : = + b_in .",
    "[ eq : bin ] the correlator eq .",
    "[ eq : obs1 ] represents the difference between correlations of the projections of the particle transverse momentum unit vectors onto an axis in the reaction plane and the correlations of the projections onto an axis that is out - of - plane or perpendicular to the reaction plane . the key advantage of using eq .",
    "[ eq : v - a ] is that it removes all the correlations among particles @xmath15 and @xmath36 that are not related to the reaction plane orientation  @xcite .",
    "the contribution given by the term @xmath37 can be neglected because directed flow averages to zero in a rapidity region symmetric with respect to mid - rapidity , as used in this analysis and the contribution due to directed flow fluctuations is very small ( see section  [ sec : simulations ] for a quantitative estimate ) .",

    "studies of the various physics contributions to @xmath40 $ ] are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : simulations ] .    based on the current theoretical understanding of the chiral magnetic effect",
    "one might expect the following features of the correlator @xmath31 :    * _ magnitude _ : the first estimates  @xcite predicted a signal of the order of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the net topological charge and @xmath43 is the positive pion multiplicity in one unit of rapidity  the expected rapidity scale for correlations due to topological domains , see below .",
    "more accurate estimates  @xcite including the strength of the magnetic field and topological domains production rates , were found to be close to the same number .",
    "it corresponds to values of @xmath44 of the order of @xmath45 for mid - central collisions , and to @xmath3 for the correlator @xmath31 . *",
    "_ charge combinations _ :",
    "if the particles , after leaving the domain experience no medium effects ( re - interaction with other particles in the system ) , one would expect @xmath46 .",
    "thus , in the absence of medium effects , one expects @xmath47 . if the process occurs in a dense medium one needs to account for correlation modifications due to particle interaction with the medium  @xcite .",
    "the effect of these modifications is similar to the modification of the jet - like two - particle correlations which experience strong suppression of the back - to - back correlations : @xmath48 . the effect of strong radial flow can further modify this relation such that the opposite charge correlations can even become positive . *",
    "_ centrality dependence : _ under the assumption that the average size of the -violating domain does not change with centrality , the correlator should follow a @xmath49 dependence ( typical for any kind of correlations due to clusters ; @xmath50 is the multiplicity ) multiplied by a factor accounting for the variation of the magnetic field .",
    "the latter is difficult to predict reliably at present , other than that it should be zero in perfectly central collisions .",
    "thus at large centralities the effect should decrease with centrality somewhat faster than @xmath49 .",
    "* _ rapidity dependence : _ the correlated particles are produced in a domain of the order of 1  fm , and it is expected that the correlations should have a width in @xmath51 of the order unity , as is typical for hadronic production from clusters  @xcite . * _ transverse momentum dependence : _ local parity violation is non - perturbative in nature and the main contribution to the signal should `` come from particles which have transverse momentum smaller than 1  gev / c ''  @xcite .",

    "one qualitative prediction is that the suppression of the back - to - back correlations should be smaller in collisions of lighter nuclei . * _ collision energy dependence : _ the effect might be stronger at lower energies , as the time integral of the magnetic field is larger . at the same time",

    "<S> parity - odd domains , corresponding to non - trivial topological solutions of the qcd vacuum , might be created during relativistic heavy - ion collisions . these domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the orbital momentum of the system created in non - central collisions . to study this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a three particle mixed harmonics azimuthal correlator which is a -even observable , but directly sensitive to the charge separation effect . </S>",
    "<S> we report measurements of this observable using the star detector in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath0=200 and 62  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented as a function of collision centrality , particle separation in rapidity , and particle transverse momentum . a signal consistent with several of the theoretical expectations </S>",

    "<S> we compare our results to the predictions of existing event generators , and discuss in detail possible contributions from other effects that are not related to parity violation . </S>"
