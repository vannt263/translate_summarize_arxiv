    "in wireless networking , determining the sets of links that can be active simultaneously is a cornerstone optimization task of combinatorial nature . for a link to be active , a given signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) threshold",
    "must be met at the receiver , according to the physical connectivity model @xcite . within this domain",
    ", previous analyses assume that the communication system employs single - user decoding ( sud ) receivers that treat interference as additive noise . for interference - limited scenarios ,",
    "it is very unlikely that all links can be active at the same time .",
    "hence , it is necessary to construct transmission schedules that orthogonalize link transmissions along some dimension of freedom , such as time .",
    "the schedule is composed by link subsets , each of which is a feasible solution to the link activation ( la ) problem .",
    "thus , for scheduling , repeatedly solving the la problem becomes the dominant computational task .",
    "intuitively , with sud , a solution to the la problem consists in links being spatially separated , as they generate little interference to each other .",
    "thus , scheduling amounts to optimal spatial reuse of the time resource .",
    "for this reason , scheduling is also referred to as spatial time - division multiple access ( stdma ) @xcite .",
    "optimal la has attracted a considerable amount of attention .",
    "problem complexity and solution approximations have been addressed in @xcite .",
    "a recent algorithmic advance is presented in @xcite .",
    "research on scheduling , which uses la as the building block , is extensive ; see , e.g , @xcite and references therein .",
    "in addition to scheduling , la is an integral part of more complicated resource management problems jointly addressing scheduling and other resource control aspects , such as rate adaptation and power control , as well as routing , in ad hoc and mesh networks ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the general problem setting of la , each link",
    "is associated with a nonnegative weight , and the objective is to maximize the total weight of the active links . the weights may be used to reflect utility values of the links or queue sizes @xcite .",
    "a different view of weights comes from the column generation , method proposed in @xcite , which has become the standard solution algorithm for scheduling as well as for joint scheduling , power control , and rate adaptation @xcite .",
    "the algorithm decomposes the problem to a master problem and a subproblem , both of which are much more tractable than the original . solving the subproblem constructs a feasible la set . in the subproblem ,",
    "the links are associated with prices coming from the linear programming dual , corresponding to the weights of our la problem .",
    "a special case of the weights is a vector of ones ; in this case , the objective becomes to maximize the cardinality of the la set .",
    "all aforementioned previous works on optimal la have assumed sud , for which interference is regarded as additive noise . in this work ,",
    "we examine the problem of optimal la under a novel setup ; namely when the receivers have multiuser decoding ( mud ) capability @xcite . note that , unlike noise , interference contains encoded information and hence is a structured signal .",
    "this is exploited by mud receivers to perform interference cancellation ( ic ) .",
    "that is , the receivers , before decoding the signal of interest , first decode the interfering signals they are able to and remove them from the received signal . for ic to take place , a receiver acts as though it is the intended receiver of the interfering signal .",
    "therefore , an interfering signal can be cancelled , i.e. , decoded at the rate it was actually transmitted , only if it is received with enough power in relation to the other transmissions , including the receiver s original signal of interest . in other words ,",
    "the `` interference - to - other - signals - and - noise '' ratio ( which is an intuitive but non - rigorous term in this context ) , must meet the sinr threshold of the interfering signal . with mud",
    ", the effective sinr of the signal of interest is higher than the original sinr , with sud , since the denominator now only contains the sum of the residual , i.e. , undecoded , interference plus noise .",
    "clearly , with mud , concurrent activation of strongly interfering links becomes more likely , enabling activation patterns that are counter - intuitive in the conventional stdma setting .",
    "the focus of our investigation is on the potential of ic in boosting the performance of la .",
    "because la is a key element in many resource management problems , the investigation opens up new perspectives of these problems as well .",
    "the topic of implementing mud receivers in real systems has recently gained interest , particularly in the low sinr domain using low - complexity algorithms ; see , e.g. , @xcite . technically , implementing ic is not a trivial task .",
    "a fundamental assumption in mud is that the receivers have information ( codebooks and modulation schemes ) of the transmissions to be cancelled .",
    "furthermore , the transmitters need to be synchronized in time and frequency .",
    "finally , the receivers must estimate , with sufficient accuracy , the channels between themselves and all transmitters whose signals are trying to decode . for our work ,",
    "we assume that mud is carried out without any significant performance impairments , and examine it as an enabler of going beyond the conventionally known performance limits in wireless networking . hence",
    ", the results we provide effectively constitute upper bounds on what can be achievable , for the considered setup , in practice .",
    "the significance of introducing mud and more specifically ic to wireless networking is motivated by the fundamental , i.e. , information - theoretic , studies of the so - called interference channel , which accurately models the physical - layer interactions of the transmissions on coupled links .",
    "the capacity region of the interference channel is a long - standing open problem , even for the two - link case , dating back to @xcite . up to now , it is only known in a few special cases ; see , e.g. , @xcite for some recent contributions .",
    "two basic findings , regarding optimal treatment of interference in the two - link case , can be summarized as follows .",
    "when the interference is very weak , it can simply be treated as additive noise .",
    "when the interference is strong enough , it may be decoded and subtracted off from the received signal , leaving an interference - free signal containing only the signal of interest plus thermal noise .    from a physical - layer perspective",
    ", the simple two - link setting above corresponds to a received signal consisting of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the signal of interest , with received power @xmath2 and encoded with rate @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the interference signal with received power @xmath5 encoded with rate @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the receiver noise with power @xmath8 .",
    "assuming gaussian signaling and capacity achieving codes , the interference @xmath4 is `` strong enough '' to be decoded , treating the signal of interest @xmath1 as additive noise , precisely if @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the sinr threshold for decoding the interference signal @xmath4 .",
    "if condition ( [ eq : intro : example1 ] ) holds , i.e. , the `` interference - to - other - signal - and - noise '' ratio is at least @xmath11 , @xmath4 can be decoded perfectly and subtracted off from @xmath12 .",
    "then , decoding the signal of interest @xmath1 is possible , provided that the interference - free part of @xmath12 has sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the sinr threshold for decoding signal @xmath1 .",
    "by contrast , if the interference is not sufficiently strong for ( [ eq : intro : example1 ] ) to hold , then it must be treated as additive noise .",
    "in such a case , decoding of signal @xmath1 is possible only when @xmath15 this way of reasoning can be extended to more than one interfering signals . towards this end , we examine the effect of ic in scenarios with potentially many links in transmission .",
    "our study has a clear focus on performance engineering in wireless networking with arbitrary topologies . in consequence , a thorough study of the gain of ic to la is highly motivated , in view of the pervasiveness of the la problem in resource management of many types of wireless networks . in the multi - link setup that we consider , the optimal scheme is to allow every receiver perform ic successively , i.e. , in multiple stages . in every stage ,",
    "the receiver decodes one interfering signal , removes it from the received signal , and continues as long as there exists an undecoded interfering link whose received signal is strong enough in relation to the sum of the residual interference , the signal of interest , and noise .",
    "this scheme is referred to as _ successive ic ( sic)_. from an optimization standpoint , modeling sic mathematically is very challenging , because the order in which cancellations take place is of significance .",
    "clearly , enumerating the potential cancellation orders will not scale at all .",
    "thus compact formulations that are able to deliver the optimal order are essential , especially under the physical connectivity model , which quantifies interference accurately .",
    "alternatively , a simplified ic scheme is to consider only the cancellations that can be performed concurrently , in a single stage . in this scheme , when determining the possibility for the cancellation of an interfering link , all remaining transmissions , no matter whether or not they are also being examined for cancellation , are regarded as interference .",
    "we refer to this scheme as _",
    "parallel ic ( pic)_. it is easily realized that some of the cancellations in sic may not be possible in pic ; thus one can expect that the gain of the latter is less than that of the former .",
    "a further restriction is to allow at most one cancellation per receiver .",
    "this scheme , which we refer to as _ single - link ic ( slic ) _ , poses additional limit on the performance gain . however , it is the simplest scheme for practical implementation and frequently captures most of the performance gain due to ic . in comparison to sic ,",
    "pic and slic are much easier to formulate mathematically , as ordering is not relevant .    in @xcite",
    ", we evaluated the potential of slic in the related problem of sinr balancing .",
    "that is , we considered as input the number of active links , let the transmit powers be variables and looked for the maximum sinr level that can be guaranteed to all links . in @xcite ,",
    "we exploited link rate adaptation to maximize the benefits of ic to aggregate system throughput . in parallel ,",
    "another set of authors has made a relevant contribution in the context of ic @xcite .",
    "they considered a sic - enabled system and introduced a greedy algorithm to construct schedules of bounded length in ad - hoc networks with mud capabilities .",
    "there though , the interference is modeled using the protocol - based model of conflict graphs @xcite , which simplifies the impact of interference , in comparison to the more accurate physical connectivity model that we are using .",
    "the overall aim of our work is to deliver a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study on optimal link activation under this novel setup in order to provide insight into the gains from adopting interference cancellation .",
    "this is achieved through the following contributions :    * first , we introduce and formalize the optimization problems of la in wireless networks with pic and sic , focusing on the latter most challenging case . *",
    "second , we prove that these optimization problems are np - hard . *",
    "third , we develop ilp formulations that enable us to approach the global optimum for problem sizes of practical interest and thus provide an effective benchmark for the potential of ic on la . *",
    "fourth , we present an extensive numerical performance evaluation that introduces insight into the maximum attainable gains of adopting ic .    we show that for some of the test scenarios the improvement is substantial .",
    "the results indicate that strong interference can indeed be taken as a great advantage in designing new notions for scheduling and cross - layer resource allocation in wireless networking with mud capabilities .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : preliminaries ] , we introduce the notation and formalize the novel optimization problems . in section",

    "we show that the order of cancellations can be conveniently modeled and derive an ilp formulation of quadratic size .",

    "the next set of constraints formulates the condition for pic : @xmath67 can be set to one only if the interference from link @xmath18 , @xmath74 , is strong enough in relation to all other active signals , including the signal of interest .",
    "if the ratio meets the sinr threshold @xmath75 for link @xmath18 , cancellation can be carried out .",
    "setting @xmath67 to zero is always feasible , on the other hand , provided that the parameter @xmath76 is large enough .",
    "a sufficiently large value is @xmath77 .",
    "the construction of reflects the fact of performing all cancellations in a single stage , as in cancelling the signal of link @xmath18 , other transmissions being cancelled in parallel are treated as additive noise . note that the model remains in fact valid even if is removed .",
    "doing so would allow the receiver of an inactive link to perform ic .",
    "however , since an inactive link does not contribute at all to the objective function , this is a minor `` semantic '' mismatch that can be simply alleviated by post - processing .    for practical purposes , each receiver may be allowed to cancel the signal of at most one interfering link .",
    "the resulting la problem , denoted la - slic , can be easily formulated by adapting the formulation for la - pic .",
    "the only required change is the addition of the set of constraints @xmath78 that restricts each receiver to cancel at most one interfering transmission .",
    "the size of the formulation , both in the numbers of variables and constraints , is of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the formulation is compact and its size grows by one magnitude in comparison to .",
    "in fact , to incorporate cancellation between link pairs , one can not expect any optimization formulation of smaller size .",
    "when implementing the formulation , two pre - processing steps can be applied to reduce the size of the problem and hence speed - up the calculation of the solution .",
    "first , the links that are infeasible , taking into account only the receiver noise , are identified by checking for every receiver whether the received snr meets the sinr threshold for activation .",
    "if the answer is `` false '' , i.e. , @xmath80 , then link @xmath19 is removed from consideration by fixing the @xmath81 variable to zero .",
    "second , the link pairs for which cancellation can never take place are found by checking , for every receiver and interfering signal , whether the `` interference - to - signal - of - interest - and - noise '' ratio meets the sinr threshold for decoding the interference signal .",
    "if the answer is `` false '' , i.e. , @xmath82 , then link @xmath19 can not decode the interference from @xmath18 and this option is eliminated from the formulation by setting the respective variable @xmath67 to zero .",
    "incorporating the optimal ic scheme , sic , to the la problem is highly desired , since it may activate sets that are infeasible by pic . however , using ilp to formulate compactly the solution space of la - sic , is challenging .",
    "this is because the formulation has to deal , for each link , with a bijection giving the cancellation sequence .",
    "we propose an ilp approach and present it in two steps . in this section ,",
    "we consider la - sic under the assumption that all links have a common sinr threshold for activation , i.e. , @xmath83 . in the next section ,",
    "we address the general case of individual sinr thresholds .    for sic under common sinr threshold ,",
    "we exploit the problem structure and show that the optimal cancellation order can be handled implicitly in the optimization formulation . as a result , we show that la - sic can in fact be formulated as compactly as la - pic , i.e. , using @xmath79 variables and constraints .",
    "the idea is to formulate an optimality condition on the ordering of ic . to this end , consider an arbitrary link @xmath19 and observe that meeting the sinr threshold for decoding the signal of interest is equivalent to having in the receiver , after ic , a total amount of undecoded interference and noise at most equal to @xmath84 .",
    "we refer to this term as the _ interference margin _ @xmath85 . similarly , the interference margin that allows cancellation of the interference from link @xmath18 at the receiver of link @xmath19 is @xmath86 .",
    "consider any two interfering links @xmath18 and @xmath87 , and suppose @xmath88 .",
    "note that , because the sinr threshold is common , the condition is equivalent to @xmath89 , i.e. , the receiver of link @xmath19 experiences stronger interference from @xmath18 .",
    "if the condition holds , the cancellation of @xmath18 should be `` easier '' in some sense .",
    "thus , one may expect that if @xmath19 can decode both @xmath18 and @xmath87 , the decoding of @xmath18 should take place first . in the following ,",

    "<S> we prove that both problems are np - hard and develop compact integer linear programming formulations that enable us to approach the global optimum solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an extensive numerical performance evaluation , indicating that for low to medium sinr thresholds the improvement is quite substantial , especially with sic , whereas for high sinr thresholds the improvement diminishes and both schemes perform equally well . </S>"
