    "the approaches to search for observational evidence for the existence of black holes are provided with the various measuremental methods , such as stellar dynamics(ghez et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) , optical emission lines from gas disks(ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ; macchetto et al . 1997 ) , water maser disks(miyoshi et al . 1995 ) , x - ray lines(e.g .",
    "fe k@xmath3 line , nandra et al . 1997 ) and the strength of ultrasoft component of x - ray spectra(zhang , cui & chen 1997 )",
    ". however , all these methods are only related to gaseous processes where(at least two gravitational radius ) the gravitaional field is weak . to probe the very strong gravitational field",
    ", the radiation should result from the process near the bh horizon where a large number high - energy photons can be released .",
    "if the high - energy emission lines are identified , we can determine the large gravitaional redshift .",
    "here , we propose that grbs may be the best approach .",
    "our method is partly motivated by the recent observational evidence for the existence of fe k@xmath3 lines in the x - ray afterglows of grb 990705(amati et al .",
    "2000 ) , 990712(frontera et al .",
    "2001 ) , 991216(piro et al.2000 ) and 000214(antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ) , and in fact , grb 970508(piro et al .",
    "1999 ) and 970828(yoshida et al .",
    "1999 ) have also shown the evidence for the iron lines . according to the observed line fluence ,",
    "the mass of iron should account for about @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the sun , which contradicts with the standard fireball model for grbs because no enough irons in the interstellar medium can be around the progenitors and if the irons are produced during the bursts , it will involve the famous problem of bayon contamination . to explain the iron lines , some researches have proposed some mechanisms : with the energy injection , only a small mass of fe is required(rees & mszros 2000 ) and fe comes from supernova which requires that supernova explosion precedes the grb event by several months to years ( antonelli et al 2001 ) .",
    "the existence of iron lines shows us the some similarity of grb afterglows to agns , implying that the origin of grbs and their afterglows may be related to black holes and accretion process . in this letter",
    ", we propose a model of grbs , in which the massive black hole captures a neutron star to produce a grb and a normal star forming an accretion disk to produce the afterglow .",
    "then an alternate mechenism is also proposed to explain the iron line origin : fe line may come from the disk formed by the normal star .    in the following section",
    ", we will give a brief discription of our grb and afterglow model where we will show that some grbs may be the good candidates of black holes .",
    "in section 3 , the method to probe the firm evidence for black holes is provided , summary and outlook are presented in section 4 .",
    "our grb model is simply described as follows .",
    "a massive black hole catches a neutron star , which can produce a large number of @xmath1-ray photons through the intense astrophysical process in a short timescale . in this case",
    ", we could observed only the burst . and",
    "the minimum variability timescales of burst light curves are related to the ns size , @xmath6 , of the order of milliseconds which is consistent with grb observations , where @xmath7 is the ns radius , @xmath8 is light speed and @xmath9 is the cosmological redshift . if a binary ( a neutron star and a normal star ) rather than an isolated neutron star falls into a black hole , when the normal star is disrupted forming a disk and accreted into the black hole , x - ray and optical radiation are released . then both bursts and afterglows are observed .",
    "of course , only normal stars captured by black holes in galactic centre will produce flares in optical or x - ray band without bursts , which also may be of observability ( rees 1988 , 1990 ) . and",
    "our group now is trying to survey those optical flares .",
    "the afterglows will be very similar to the continuum radiation of agns , for example , the spectrum of the afterglow of grb 970508 ( galama , t.j .",
    "1998a ) may like that of a blazar .",
    "what s more , the accretion process can account for the afterglows decaying in time as a power - law . after the tidal disruption of a normal star occurs , two processes will supply mass to the central black hole .",
    "the first has been studied by rees ( 1988 , 1990 ) : the stream of stellar mass strung out in far - ranging orbits , showing that the infall rate declines as @xmath10 .",
    "the other case involves mass loss from teh inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "cannizzo et al.(1990 ) have discussed this case of late - time evolution of @xmath11 in which the accretion disk supply rate varies as @xmath12 .",
    "bh - ns interaction has been studied by some previous authors with the numerical simulations ( lattimer & schramm 1976 ; kluniak & lee 1998 ; janka et al .",
    "1999 ) , which was also taken as one of successful models of grbs . here",
    ", we also have analyzed the process with simple calculations .",
    "assuming the different masses of black holes , we derived the gravitational redshifts by computing the gravitational radius @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is gravitational constant ) and the critical radius @xmath16 where a neutron star is disrupted by the central black hole through tidal force . in calculations , we suppose the mass and radius of the neutron star are 1.4 @xmath5 and 10 km respectively . for a comparison ,",
    "the process is computed with landau potential ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) : @xmath17 and pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) : @xmath18 in separation . in figure 1 ,",
    "two dashed lines have shown @xmath0 as a function of the bh masses according to landau(up ) and pseudo - newtonian(down ) potential respectively .",
    "we note @xmath19 when masses are very large , implying that massive black holes may be the better test for observations .    from the above analysis",
    ", a black hole capturing an isolated neutron stars produces a large number of high - energy photons through a very intense process , which is a grb observed . with the known total energy of grbs ,",
    "we evaluated the gravitational redshift around the critical radius @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total rest energy of a neutron star and @xmath22 is the isotropic @xmath1-ray energy . since @xmath23 , we can find @xmath24 .",
    "hence , we estimate the duration of a burst , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the black hole , which also tells us the shorter bursts with the smaller central masses .",
    "the equation(1 ) can give a low limit of @xmath0 : @xmath27 then the determination of @xmath0 will depend on our constraint on the masses of black holes . with eqs .",
    "3 and 5 , we can also give a constraint on the masses of black holes , @xmath28    when a binary is falling into a black hole , the normal star will be disrupted to form a accretion disk in the zone far away from the black hole which is very similar to the accretion disks in agns , and afterglows in x - ray , optical and radio bands can be produced in the disk from where fe k@xmath3 lines are also emitted .",
    "we consider a thick disk model , then the radial velocity @xmath29 , where @xmath3 is the viscosity parameter ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the sound speed .",
    "the viscosity timescale is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the disk radius .",
    "@xmath31 can be estimated from @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath36 is the disk temperature and @xmath37 is the mass of the proton . since the radiation of afterglows is emitted from the disk , one can find ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the disk luminosity also the afterglow luminosity , and @xmath40 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "therefore , we reach an important result on the masses of black holes : @xmath41 where we have taken @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .    to further test our model , we firstly calculated the isotropic @xmath1-ray energy ( @xmath22 ) and optical ( r band ) peak luminosity ( @xmath39 ) of 20 well - studied grbs with known cosmological redshifts ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2000 ) , and derived some intinsic parameters of grbs which are dispalyed in table 1 . in the calculation , we accept the cosmological model with @xmath44 , taking @xmath45 , the timescale when the lightcurves of afterglows evolve from the peak flux to the half . with these parameters and above equations , we can estimate the ranges of the black hole masses and @xmath0 in our model . and",
    "r band lumilosity also gives a check on bh masses using the eddington luminosity limit : @xmath46 our final results are presented in table 1 and plotted in figure 1 , in which two dashed lines have been noted above . from figure 1 , we may draw following three conclusions .",
    "first , we have found gravitational redshifts of some grbs are very large : seven grbs whose gravitaional redshifts @xmath47 , which strongely implies that the central engines of these grbs should be the best candidates of black holes .",
    "second , the masses of black holes mostly distribute around @xmath48 which are comparable to the masses of black holes in the normal galaxies as in our galaxy .",
    "third , the range of @xmath0 of grbs calculated is consistent with the range given by two lines , supporting our model .    because short bursts ( with the duration @xmath49 ) correspnd to the relatively small masses of black holes , radiation from the disk around low - mass black holes will be so faint that it can not be observed by our optical telescopes",
    "therefore , our model for grbs and afterglows may give a reliable explanation why afterglows can not be observed from most detected grbs but only in a very small part with the longer durations . because in galaxies the number of isolated neutron stars is larger than the number of neutron stars in binary systems according to the observations of pulsars ( taylor , manchester & lyne 1993 ) , the possibility of",
    "the former captured by black holes will be much larger , implying the afterglows of grbs are really rare , which is consistent with the observations ( lamb 2000 ) .",
    "the different actions between long - duration grbs and agns may result from the circumstance of black holes , since agns are in a dirty environment while grbs in a clean one with a neutron star or binary captured occassionally .",
    "we think that our unified model as a possible mechanism of grbs and afterglows can successfully explain the different occuring rates of bursts and afterglows and the formation of iron lines recently discovered .",
    "in the above section , we have applied our model to some grbs with known cosmological redshifts . in table 1",
    ", we note that some grbs have very large gravitational redshifts such as grb 970828 ( @xmath50 ) , 980425 ( @xmath51 ) , 000301c ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , in our model , these grb central engines should be the good candidates of black holes .",
    "however , to further probe the central body of a gamma - ray burst , we expect that high spectral resolution detectors can find the reliable emission lines in the spectra of grbs and also suggest that pair annihilation lines ( 511 kev line ) may be the best approach .",
    "hitherto , the emission lines have been detected and identified in the energy spectrum of grbs by venera 11 and 12 ( mazets et al .",
    "1981 ) before 1980 and baste ( briggs et al . 1997 , 1999 ) in 1990 s .",
    "the centroid energies of emission lines distribute in two different ranges , 330 - 460 and 40 - 50 kev .    the lines in the broad range of 330 - 460 kev were interpreted as the strongly redshifted 511 kev annihilation lines , but the emission lines at 40 - 50 kev were thought to be formed in another process . for instance , grb 790526 revealed a emission line at 45 kev which was previously thought to be the reliable evidence of emissions at the cycloton frequence in the surface of a nearby magnetized neutron star ( mazets et al .",
    "1981 ) . however , since the measurement of the redshift of grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , the evidence for a cosmological distance scale for most or all bursts is comfirmed , then grbs can not be a local phenomina on the surface of a neutron star . hence , we need a new physical mechanism to explain the emission lines observed . in this letter , we interprete the emission lines as strongly redshifted 511 kev annihilation lines in the gravitational field of black holes . supposing the cosmological redshift of grbs , @xmath53 , we calculated the gravitational redshifts of the lines whose centroids are around 50 kev , @xmath54 in accordance with our model expection . because the gravitational redshift produced by the known compact objects including neutron stars or even possible strange stars can not be over @xmath55 ,",
    "we may make our decision that the central bodies of these bursts are the best candidates of black holes .",
    "in fact , the other lines at 330 - 460 kev observed have the gravitational reshifts in the range 0.1 - 0.5 , which is also very difficultly realized on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "therefore , grbs may really originate in the region with the very strong gravitational field , where the central progenitors are black holes with the captured neutron stars .",
    "because the iron lines discovered in the x - ray afterglows of some bursts imply the relation between agns and grbs , a possible model of grbs and afterglows is proposed in the letter . in our model , we can determine the range of gravitational redshifts of @xmath1-ray radiation with the intrinsic parameters of grbs and afterglows , and we note some of them are very large ( @xmath2 ) implying grbs as probes of ultra - strong gravity of black holes .",
    "however , very firm evidence should come from the identification of grb line emissions . through the determination of the very strong gravitational redshift of emission lines",
    ", one can identify the central bodies as black holes .",
    "thus , the spectral line observation of grbs can provide a very powerful evidence for the existence of black holes .",
    "because of the level limit on the present missions , we need more advanced detectors with higher spectral resolutions in future . here",
    ", we hope that recently launched hete - ii and swift(in 2003 ) will do much work on the search for grb emission lines    the model of grb afterglows in this letter is also used to explain the x - ray flares recently detected in several nearby normal galaxies with the rosat data base . assuming the number of massive stars which can produce nss through supernova explosion is about @xmath56 of total star number and one supernova event occurs in 100 years , we can simply estimate the density ratio of stars and nss in a normal galaxy as @xmath57 .",
    "the observations have given the grb rate @xmath58 , so we can approximately obtain the flare event rate @xmath59 which is consistant with the theoretical expected tidal disruption rate ( rees 1988 , 1990 ) and the searching results given by rosat all - sky survey ( komossa & dahlem 2001 ) . with the flare event rate and assuming a solar mass is swallowed by the black hole per event , we find that the central black hole masses in normal galaxies can increase at least up to @xmath60 ( such as the massive black holes in the center of our galaxy and m31 ) through the tidal disruption of stars within the hubble time scale ( @xmath61yr ) .",
    "this conclusion is also important to the formation and evolution of normal galaxies and massive black holes .",
