    "recent astronomical observations of type ia supernovae with redshift parameter @xmath0 @xcite , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite etc . provided evidence that we may live in a low mass density universe ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the observations lead to a convincing belief in modern cosmology that a part of the universe is filled up with dark energy ( @xmath2 ) , which may be addressed by a suitable cosmological constant .",
    "one of the recent predictions that the present universe accelerating is remarkable which is not properly understood yet . the present accelerating phase of the universe may be accommodated in cosmological models , obtained from theories : either by a modification of the einstein s theory of gravity ( gr ) or by including a time varying cosmological constant .",
    "a number of literature appeared which addressed the present accelerating phase making use of exotic kind of fields in the matter sector of the einstein s field equation .",
    "the study of late universe however , remains open to address the present issues in other theories .",
    "one of the early attempts to modify gr is based on adding curvature squared terms to the einstein - hilbert action which is known as generalized theory of gravity was used to obtain early inflation .",
    "the theory is found to have a number of good features important for understanding early universe .",
    "starobinsky @xcite shown that @xmath3 term in the einstein hilbert action admits inflation long before the advent of inflation is actually realized .",
    "however , the efficacy of the theory is known only after the seminal work on inflation by guth @xcite , who employed temperature dependent phase transition mechanism to obtain inflation .",
    "the inflationary scenario of the early universe is attractive and which may solve some of the outstanding problems in cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is known that higher order gravity with suitable counter terms viz .",
    ", @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and cosmological constant ( @xmath6 ) added to the einstein - hilbert action , one gets a perturbation theory which is well behaved , formally renormalizable and asymptotically free @xcite .    cosmological models considering perfect fluid as a source of matter in the framework of higher derivative gravity have been studied in the literature @xcite in order to obtain viable cosmological scenario of the early universe . in the absence of particle creation , particle number is conserved in the perfect fluid ( i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is particle number density ) .",
    "it may be pointed out here that perfect fluid in equilibrium generates neither entropy ( @xmath9 ) nor frictional heat flow as their dynamics is reversible .    however , in the early universe a number of processes might have occurred leading to a deviation from perfect fluid assumption e.g. viscosity which is to be taken into account .",
    "it is known that real fluids behave irreversibly and therefore it is important to consider dissipative processes both in cosmology and in astrophysics .",
    "some of the dissipative processes in the early universe responsible for viscosity may be due to the decoupling of neutrinos from the radiation era , the decoupling of matter from radiation during the recombination era , creation of superstrings in the quantum era , particle collisions involving gravitons , cosmological quantum particle creation processes and formation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted from observations that a non negligible dissipative bulk stress on cosmological scales at the late universe phase might be important",
    ". the possible source of such viscosity may be due to ( i ) gaseous matter in the framework of relativistic gravity which may give rise to internal self - interaction leading to a negative cosmic bulk pressure @xcite , ( ii ) deviation of the non relativistic particle in the substratum from dust . for a non - relativistic substratum cosmic anti - friction may generate a negative fluid bulk pressure which has been noted @xcite in the framework of einstein gravity .",
    "since the pioneering work of dirac @xcite , who proposed a theory with a time varying gravitational coupling constant @xmath10 , a number of literature @xcite appeared with variable @xmath10 and @xmath11 in higher derivative theory of gravity in order to obtain cosmological models accommodating the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "recent applications of the apparent magnitude - redshift test , based on type ia supernovae @xcite , strongly favours a theory with a positive @xmath12 term .",
    "a number of ansatze have been proposed for a dynamical decaying @xmath6 with time @xcite .",
    "berman and collaborators @xcite pointed out that cosmological constant may vary as @xmath13 , which seems to play a major role in cosmology . to obtain a time varying cosmological constant",
    ", one can assume different phenomenological relations proportional to the hubble parameter , one such example @xcite considered in recent times is of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is hubble parameter .",
    "cosmological models with imperfect fluid have been explored in the presence of a dynamical cosmological constant and gravitational constant in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , important to look into viable cosmological models with variable @xmath10 and @xmath11 in higher derivative theory of gravity in the presence of imperfect fluid .    to describe a relativistic theory of viscosity ,",
    "eckart @xcite made the first attempt .",
    "however , the theories of dissipation in eckart formulation suffers from serious shortcoming , viz .",
    ", causality and stability @xcite regardless of the choice of equation of state .",
    "the problem arises due to first order nature of the theory , since it considers only first order deviation from equilibrium .",
    "it has been shown that the problems of the relativistic imperfect fluid may be resolved by including higher order deviation terms in the transport equation @xcite .",
    "israel and stewart @xcite , and pavon @xcite developed a fully relativistic formulation of the theory taking into account second order deviation terms in the theory , which is termed as `` transient '' or `` extended '' irreversible thermodynamics ( in short , _ eit _ ) .",
    "the crucial difference between the standard eckart and the extended israel - stewart transport equations is that the latter is a differential evolution equations , while the former is an algebraic relation .",
    "extended irreversible thermodynamics takes its name from the fact that the set needed to describe non - equilibrium states is extended to include the dissipative variables ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . in irreversible thermodynamics ,",
    "the entropy is no longer conserved , but grows , according to the second law of thermodynamics ( i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "bulk viscosity arises typically in mixtures either of different species or of the species but with different energies .",
    "the solutions of the full causal theory are well behaved for all the times .",
    "therefore , the best currently available theory for analyzing dissipative processes in the universe is the full israel - stewart theory ( fis ) . using the transport equation obtained from _ eit _ , in addition to dynamical equation obtained from either einstein gravity @xcite or modified gravity @xcite cosmological solutions are generally obtained . the motivation of this paper is to explore cosmological solutions in the modified theory of gravity in the presence of variable @xmath10 and @xmath11 with imperfect fluid described by fis theory .",
    "it is interesting to study the behaviour of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the presence of viscosity .",
    "+ the characteristic temperature of the universe may be determined in the presence of viscosity in the fis theory . however , it may be pointed out here that in a number of literature @xcite the evolution of temperature of the universe in the presence of viscosity from gibbs equation is considered in the einstein gravity .",
