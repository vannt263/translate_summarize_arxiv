    "the  satellite ( gehrels 2004 ) has revolutionised our understanding of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , and the x - ray telescope ( xrt , burrows 2005 ) has played a major role in this process .",
    "for example , xrt data have shown that the early x - ray light curve is much more complex than originally thought , often containing a shallow - decay ` plateau ' phase interpreted variously as energy injection in a forward shock ( zhang 2006 ) , reverse shock emission ( uhm & beloborodov 2007 ) and dust - scattering of the prompt grb emission ( shao &  dai 2007 ; although this has recently been ruled out by shen 2008 ) .",
    "the high impact of the xrt has been made possible by s unique rapid slewing capability : the large field - of - view burst alert telescope ( bat , barthelmy 2005a ) detects grbs , and  then automatically repoints itself so that the narrow - field xrt and uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming 2005 ) can observe the new burst within 6090 seconds of the trigger .",
    "the xrt has detected 95% of -bat triggered grbs , most of those within minutes of the trigger , usually providing the most accurate rapidly available localisation of the grb and enabling early follow up with ground telescopes .",
    "s x - ray afterglow light curves and spectra , starting at typically @xmath0100 s have been crucial to the discoveries made by  ( see zhang 2007 ; obrien 2006 ; willingale 2007 , for reviews of the impact of  on grb science ) .",
    "because grbs fade rapidly , follow - up observers need to make quick decisions about whether or not to invest observing time on a given burst .",
    "this is especially true of potentially unusual bursts , such as high - redshift candidates or under - luminous grbs .",
    "thus it is desirable for grb data to be rapidly available and analysed quickly , reliably and ideally in a uniform manner .",
    "data are downlinked many times per day and are immediately processed by the swift data center ( sdc ) at goddard space flight center and made available to the public via the sdc and data centres in the uk and italy , minutes to hours after the downlink .",
    "we ( the -xrt team ) have developed software which , when data arrive at the uk swift science data centre ( ukssdc ) , automatically determines the best possible xrt grb position and builds x - ray light curves and spectra ; the results are then published on the internet .",
    "this provides a homogeneously generated catalogue of data , which we detail and discuss in this paper ( section  [ sec : res ] ) , following a description of the software .",
    "there are two types of grb follow - up data telemetered from : tdrss and malindi data ( described below ) .",
    "initially , our software only worked with malindi data , however in 2008 february we modified our ground - based software to work with tdrss data as well ( evans 2008a ) ; this provides better positions , positions of fainter grbs , and more reliable light curves and spectra than those produced on board ( although these should not be used for scientific analysis ) .      when  first detects and observes a grb , some data are immediately telemetered to the ground via nasa s tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) .",
    "among these ` tdrss data ' are the xrt single pixel event report ( ` sper ' ) data .",
    "s xrt selects between windowed timing ( wt , high time resolution but only 1-d spatial information ) and photon counting ( pc , lower time resolution but full spatial information ) modes automatically , based on the count rate in the central portion of the ccd ( hill 2005 ) .",
    "when the xrt enters pc mode during the first look at a new grb , event lists containing every single - pixel ( grade 0 ) event above 0.55 kev detected within the central 200@xmath1200 pixel region , the sper data , are delivered to the xrt team via the gcn system every 2 minutes until  slews away from the burst ( up to 2 ks after the trigger ) .",
    "it must be noted that while we have made our products as reliable as possible , sper data are not fully calibrated and the light curves and spectra are intended as quick - look products ; they should not be used for scientific analysis .      `",
    "malindi data ' are available several hours after a grb trigger and comprise the full observation dataset .",
    "nine or ten times per day ,  passes over the malindi ground station in kenya and downlinks the data buffered on board .",
    "these are then processed at the sdc and delivered to archives in the us , uk and italy , typically 90120 minutes after the malindi downlink .",
    "also observes grbs which did not trigger the bat , but are uploaded as targets of opportunity ( toos ) . for these bursts",
    "only malindi data are telemetered .",
    "malindi data are grouped into _ observations _",
    ", usually one per day , each with a unique obsid .",
    "a single observation may contain many _ snapshots _ ; that is , pointings toward the source , since  is in a low earth orbit and thus its targets get occulted by the earth once per orbit .",
    "the terminology _ observations _ and _ snapshots _ is standard parlance , and will be used throughout this paper .      in this paper",
    "we introduce tools to produce high - precision positions , light curves and spectra from xrt data , and describe the automatic application of these tools to grbs .",
    "this gives us a catalogue of results for all 318 grbs detected by the -xrt up to grb 080723b , and we discuss the implications for afterglow science from this analysis . while our dataset can be used to test any models for grb emission , we do this in the conext of the fireball model ( e.g.  rees & mszros 1994 , sari , piran &  narayan 1998 ) , which is the current consensus model .    in this model the grb progenitor launches highly relativistic jets of material in a series of shells , of differing bulk lorentz factors .",
    "internal collisions ( i.e.  within the jet ) between shells cause shocks which radiate the grb ` prompt emission ' .",
    "the x - ray data presented in this paper may contain the tail of this prompt emission , however it is thought to arise predominantly from the afterglow .",
    "this is emission from an external shock which forms where the jet is decelerated by the circumburst medium , and which propogates into that medium , cooling by synchrotron radiation as it does so .",
    "see piran ( 2005 ) for a comprehensive review of the fireball model .",
    "this paper is laid out thus :    *  2 ( pp  ) : xrt automatic analysis tools : * *  2.1 ( pp  ) : spectra . * *  2.2 ( pp  ) : positions . * *  2.3 ( pp  ) : light curves &  hardness ratios . *",
    " 3 ( pp  ) : web tools to analyse any xrt source *  4 ( pp  ) : results of xrt grb analysis *  5 ( pp  ) : a canonical x - ray light curve ? *  6 ( pp  ) : understanding the x - ray afterglow    throughout this paper , errors quoted in all tables are at the 90%  confidence level .",
    "error bars on data in all figures are 1-@xmath2 uncertainties .",
    "we have developed software to produce three types of data products : ` enhanced ' positions , light curves and spectra .",
    "the spectra were announced in evans ( 2008b ) , and are presented in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "the method of enhancing xrt positions has been previously documented ( goad 2007 ; hereafter g07 ) , however we have improved the algorithm , resulting in a factor of 2 improvement in precision ( section  [ sec : astrom ] ) .",
    "the light curve code has been published by evans ( 2007 ) and only minor modifications are described here ( section  [ sec : lc ] ) along with details of new functionality which has been made available to the user .",
    "we also describe automatic light curve fitting , in section  [ sec : fitlc ] .    for grbs which trigger the bat ,",
    "these products are created automatically while grbs observed as toos by  must be manually registered for automatic analysis .",
    "this is usually done at the time of the too upload , so the data products are available as rapidly as for bat - detected bursts .",
    "before any of these products are produced , the xrt data are reprocessed at the ukssdc using the latest release of the xrtpipeline tool .",
    "this may differ from the version used at the sdc to create the cleaned event lists available from the quick - look and archive sites .",
    "when a new version of the  software or calibration is released , we carry out some tests to confirm our product - generation code works reliably with the new release and then switch to using the latest version .",
    "we do not however reprocess earlier grbs with the new release of the software .      to create a spectrum from malindi data , an image is formed from the first available pc mode event list , and ximage",
    "is used to identify any sources . the brightest source within the bat error circle ( or equivalent for bursts detected by other missions )",
    "is assumed to be the grb , and the sky - coordinate point - spread - function ( psf ) fit routine developed for the position enhancement ( section  [ sec : astrom ] ) is used to determine the source position in the xrt astrometric frame .",
    "we use only observations which begin within 12 hours of the first one .",
    "each observation is subdivided into snapshots , and these may be further subdivided into times where pile up  in which multiple photons are registered as single events  is or is not an issue .",
    "to identify intervals affected by pile up we first search for times where the count rate within a 30 pixel radius circular region centred on the source is above 0.6  in pc mode or 150  in wt mode . in pc mode",
    "we then obtain the psf profile of the source and compare it to the calibrated , non - piled - up psf ( moretti 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates not only whether the source is piled up , but the radius out to which pile up is a factor , @xmath3 .",
    "if the source is piled up , we use an annular extraction region to obtain source data , with an inner radius @xmath3 . for wt mode data we assume",
    "the data are piled up whenever the count rate exceeds 150 and use a box annulus extraction region , where the inner radius is that necessary to keep the measured count rate below this level . for alternative methods of identifying and eliminating pile up , see vaughan ( 2006 ) or romano ( 2006 ) .",
    "where the data are not piled up , we use a circular ( rectangular ) extraction region for pc ( wt ) mode . for each snapshot",
    "we determine the mean source count rate and use this to choose the radius of the source extraction region , according to table  [ tab : sreg ] ; this maximises the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum and is identical to the method used for light curves .",
    "once the data have been divided into time intervals  each with a source extraction region  we generate a source spectrum , source event list and full frame event list for each one . using the full frame event lists we create an exposure map and ( using this and the source spectrum ) an ancillary response file ( arf ) per interval .",
    "we then combine the source event lists from each time interval using extractor to get a single source spectrum .",
    "we similarly combine the arfs , using the addarf tool ; each arf is weighted according to the proportion of counts in the total source spectrum which came from this time interval .",
    "this is not the same as extracting a single spectrum , exposure map and arf from an event list spanning multiple snapshots , since in that case the weighting of the snapshots is determined by the exposure map ( hence exposure in each orbit ) , but grbs are not of constant brightness .",
    "the arfs must be correctly weighted since the proximity of the source to the bad columns on the ccd , and hence the effective detector area , will change from one snapshot to the next .",
    "that weighting by counts is the correct approach is readily demonstrated : the true number of counts from the the source ( @xmath4 ) is simply the measured counts ( @xmath5 ) multiplied by some correction factor ( @xmath6 , implicit in the arf ) which reflects counts lost to ( for example ) the bad columns .",
    "if there are multiple snapshots , the true total number of counts is @xmath7 , i.e.  a the overall correction factor ( or arf ) is the count - weighted mean of the individual arfs .",
    "the backscal keyword must be set for the source spectrum , for use by xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "since this can be different for each time interval included ( the source region size is variable ) , this is taken as the weighted mean of the backscal values from the individual source spectra extracted per time interval , weighted according to the number of counts in those spectra .",
    "a background spectrum is also produced . in wt mode background data",
    "are extracted from the entire window , excluding a 120-pixel ( 283 ) wide box centred on the source . in pc mode",
    "the background region is an annulus with an inner radius of 60 pixels ( 142 ) and an outer radius of 110 pixels ( 260 ) ; if this extends beyond the edge of the detector window it is shifted accordingly ; the inner circle of course remains centred on the source . to create the background spectrum we do not subdivide the data more finely than the observations .",
    "for each observation we identify any sources in the background region using ximage and exclude those areas from the extraction region .",
    "the individual observations background spectra are then combined as for the source spectra .",
    "the spectra thus produced were extensively verified by the -xrt team . our test procedure consisted of producing spectra both manually and using this software .",
    "these were both fitted with the same model and the best - fitting parameters compared .",
    "we did this for more than thirty spectra and in every case , the difference between the parameters from the automatic and manual spectra were much less than the uncertainties on those parameters .",
    "we therefore conclude that the automatic generation of spectra is reliable .",
    "spectra are automatically created for each new grb observed by the xrt , and are updated as new data are received .",
    "the results are posted online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_spectra in postscript and gif format .",
    "we also provide a tar archive for download which contains the source and background spectra and the arf file necessary for users to fit the data themselves .",
    "the results of automatic spectral fitting ( below ) are available from the same website .",
    "since the creation of an xrt spectrum is useful for any target observed by , not just grbs , we have created a tool to allow users to build spectra using our software for any object observed by the xrt , see section  [ sec : ngrb ] .",
