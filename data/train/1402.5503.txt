    "many advanced sensor network applications require that the sensed information are delivered in the form of broadband multimedia by resource - constrained sensor nodes , or need the sensor nodes to be survivable in highly dynamic spectrum environments .",
    "this is hard to achieve in traditional wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) , since they usually compete for limited available bandwidth on fixed unlicensed bands .",
    "a promising sensor networking solution for these applications is the newly introduced paradigm of cognitive radio sensor networks ( crsn ) @xcite , which incorporates cognitive radio ( cr ) capability into the traditional wsn . without causing harmful interference to the primary user ( pu ) systems",
    ", crsn can provide dynamic spectrum access and the bandwidth as high as possible to meet the application - specific qos requirement .    according to the nsf spectrum occupancy measurements",
    "@xcite , the spectrum occupation pattern is sparse . exploiting this sparse prior ,",
    "several compressed wideband sensing schemes are developed based on the literatures of compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite .",
    "tian developed a distributed compressed spectrum sensing approach for wideband cr networks @xcite .",
    "her scheme can achieve high - performance at low sampling rate below the nyquist rate .",
    "several other works @xcite-@xcite have also studied the application of cs on wideband spectrum sensing .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , their emphasis is not on the specific sampling methods , i.e. little information is provided about the structure of the sampler and their feasibility in practical implementation .",
    "moreover , their sampling rate for individual cr should exceed the sum of the active bandwidth , which is still too high for the energy - constrained crsn nodes .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for crsn .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we propose practical wideband sampling structure in fine detail .",
    "second , the required sampling rate in our scheme is equivalent to the bandwidth of a single subband , much lower than existing schemes .",
    "our sampling structure is similar to the sub - nyquist sampler proposed recently by mishali and eldar - the modulated wideband converter ( mwc ) @xcite .",
    "the major difference is that we only deploy one sampling channel in a single crsn node , and each node randomly mixes the signals of all subbands by spectrum aliasing .",
    "this simple structure is extremely convenient for implementation in the resource - constrained crsn , due to its low hardware cost and power consumption .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we establish basic models for the pu signal and the crsn , and formulate our target problem . in section iii",
    ", we introduced the distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme in detail .",
    "then , extensive simulation results are presented in section iv to further validate our proposed algorithm .",
    "finally , the whole paper is concluded in section v.",
    "we consider the radio environment to be an ultra - wide frequency band where different pu systems and large numbers of crsn nodes coexist .",
    "the entire @xmath0 wide spectrum is centered at zero and can be divided into @xmath1 non - overlapping subbands of equal bandwidth @xmath2 , thus @xmath3 .",
    "we assume there are @xmath4 pus occupying some of the subbands . according to @xcite ,",
    "the pu signal is sparse within the range of the whole spectrum .",
    "therefore , we can safely assume that @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "note that we will take this assumption as our basic prerequisite throughout this paper .",
    "we assume real - valued continuous - time wideband signal of the primary users to be @xmath5 , which is band - limited within @xmath6 and its fourier transform can be defined by @xmath7    as mentioned above , the frequency domain is zero centered and divided into @xmath1 subbands of equal bandwidth @xmath2 , @xmath8 can be re - written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and    @xmath11 is the signal in the @xmath12th subband of the wideband spectrum .",
    "thus , we can represent the primary signal using a vector @xmath13^t$ ] . since @xmath5 is real - valued continuous - time signal ,",
    "the real part of fourier transform @xmath14 is an even function , and the imaginary part is an odd function .",
    "then , obviously @xmath15 .",
    "the secondary user ( su ) system is comprised of crsn nodes and fusion centers .",
    "the spatially distributed crsn nodes can be wireless terminals such as webcams , cellphones and laptops .",
    "their application - specific qos requires that these crsn nodes deliver event features reliably and timely in the form of multimedia , resulting in high bandwidth demands .",
    "therefore , our objective is to design a resource - efficient wideband spectrum sensing scheme for the crsn .        as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , crsn nodes located in a restricted locality form a cluster @xcite .",
    "all nodes in one cluster sense the wide band cooperatively .",
    "there is a fusion center ( fc ) in each cluster , which is a special kind of node equipped with more or renewable power sources . as a result ,",
    "fc have additional computation capability and longer transmission ranges . since all the crsn nodes in a cluster are close to each other , we assume that a common control channel can be found to exchange spectrum sensing information .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath16 crsn nodes engaged in the wideband spectrum sensing task .",
    "because these @xmath16 nodes are close to each other , the pu activities in their ambient radio environment are assumed to be identical .",
    "however , due to different channel fadings , the received primary signal can be different at each crsn nodes . during the sensing interval",
    ", the primary signal received by the @xmath17th crsn nodes can be expressed by @xmath18    using @xmath19^t $ ] and @xmath20^t $ ] to represent channel fading and noise of all subbands , we can rewrite ( 3 ) in the matrix form    @xmath21",
    "in this section , we propose a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme that can effectively distribute the sensing task to many crsn nodes and relieve the sensing and processing burden on a single node . we first describe the compressed aliasing sampling scheme originated from the modulated wideband converter ( mwc ) , then explain the fusion strategy and corresponding recovering algorithm .        as shown in fig.2 , our proposed sensing scheme comprises two steps .    * step 1 : * @xmath16 crsn nodes sample the wideband independently at ultra - low rate equivalent to the bandwidth of a single subband , then report the aliased spectrum information to the fc .",
    "* step 2 : * after receiving all the aliased spectrum information from the @xmath16 crsn nodes , the the fc performs compressed sensing recovery algorithm , and broadcast the sensing result to all the crsn nodes within the cluster .",
    "the sampling method is similar to the modulated wideband converter(mwc ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the difference is that we only deploy one channel of the mwc system in a single crsn node . the sampling structure in the @xmath17th crsn node",
    "is shown in fig.3 .        according to fig.3 ,",
    "after the primary signal @xmath22 arrives at the @xmath17th crsn node , it is multiplied by a high frequency mixing function @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath23 is a @xmath24-length periodic spread - spectrum mixing function which aims to alias the spectrum and thus obtain a mixture of signals from all the subbands .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for every @xmath28 . in practice",
    ", @xmath23 is characterized by pseudorandom sequences generated by certain seeds known at the fc .",
    "therefore , the aliasing pattern of the spectrum is known at the fc .",
    "then , the mixed analog spectrum signal goes through a low - pass filter ( lpf ) with cutoff frequency @xmath29 and the filtered signal is sampled at rate @xmath30 . for convenient spectrum access , we choose @xmath31 to be equal to @xmath2 , so low that existing a / d converters are competent for the task .",
    "we perform discrete - time fourier transform ( dtft ) on the sampled data , in order to obtain the frequency domain form of the mixed spectrum . according to @xcite , @xmath32    where @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath36 . after a closer examination",
    ", we can easily find that ( 6 ) is a weighted sum of the spectrum of all subbands , and can be rewritten in the matrix form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] .    at last , we calculate the average level of the band - limited spectrum mixture , and transmit this aliased spectrum information to the fc through the control channel .",
    "@xmath39      @xmath40    @xmath16 crsn nodes engage in the spectrum sensing task and report their spectrum mixture value to the fusion center , all the reported value can compose a @xmath16-length vector @xmath41^t$ ]    here , we further use the assumption that all the @xmath16 crsn nodes and the fc are close to each other and their channel fadings are approximately the same , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "it can be estimated at the fc and broadcasted to all the crsn nodes .",
    "the @xmath16-length vector collected from @xmath16 distributed crsn nodes to the fc can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fourier coefficient matrix of mixing functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a @xmath47 measurement matrix , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is also a noise vector .    assuming that the channel fading are also almost flat within a single subband , i.e. @xmath50 , equation ( 9 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 , and we denote @xmath53 , @xmath54 to be the average level of the primary signal and noise , respectively .",
    "based on the analysis in @xcite , @xmath55 can be expressed as ( 11 ) ( on the top of next page ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57    considering ( 10 ) , where @xmath58 is is an unknown sparse vector of dimension @xmath1 , @xmath59 is the measured vector of dimension @xmath16 , and @xmath55 is the known random measurement matrix of size @xmath60 . our final goal is to recover the original primary signal @xmath58 from the measured compressed vector @xmath59 and determine the idle subbands for opportunistic spectrum access . this is exactly the compressed sensing ( cs ) problem @xcite since @xmath61 .",
    "it is proved that a random sign matrix , whose entries are drawn independently from @xmath62 with equal probability , has the rip of order @xmath63 if @xmath64 @xcite@xcite , where @xmath65 is a positive constant .",
    "also , any fixed unitary row transformation of a random sign matrix has the same rip @xcite . from ( 12 )",
    ", we can see @xmath66 is a random sign matrix , this implies that @xmath67 also has rip and ( 10 ) can be solved using existing cs recovery methods .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the basis pursuit ( bp ) , a convex programming method that can solve cs problems in polynomial - time .",
    "we choose bp for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the sparsity level of the input signal is known in other omp @xcite related cs recovery algorithm .",
    "however , in our scenario , the sparsity level means the number of the active subbands and can not be estimated beforehand .",
    "second , the bp algorithm has robust performance in the noisy scenario .",
    "we first estimate global spectrum vector @xmath68 through @xmath69 minimization based noisy bp algorithm : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the variance of the gaussian noise @xmath72 .    and then define a decision vector @xmath73 of the pu activity state by comparing the @xmath12th subband estimation @xmath74 with a decision threshold @xmath75 :    @xmath76\\ ] ]    where @xmath77    the decision vector serves as our compressed wideband spectrum sensing result . after this decision vector",
    "is obtained at fc , this final result is broadcasted to all the crsn nodes within the cluster .",
    "the crsn nodes then access the spectrum according to this sensing result .",
    "to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed compressed sensing recovery algorithm , we define the normalized root mean - square estimation error ( mse ) :    @xmath78    just like any cognitive radio network , we choose the probability of detection @xmath79 and the probability of false alarms @xmath80 as our wideband sensing performance metrics . in the multi - band scenario , they can be expressed as    @xmath81    where @xmath82 represents the pu activity pattern on the spectrum .    in the following experiments",
    ", we set the system parameters to be an ultra - wideband regime .",
    "for all scenarios , we set the total bandwidth of the spectrum @xmath0 to be @xmath83ghz , and it is equally divided into @xmath84 subbands of bandwidth @xmath85mhz . among them , @xmath85 subbands are occupied by pus .",
    "note that the spectrum is symmetric to the zero point , there are @xmath86 independent active pus , half the number of the occupied subbands .",
    "the pu occupation ratio is @xmath87% .    _",
    "1 ) comparison of sampling rate : _    in table i , we compare the sampling rate between our scheme and existing ones . here",
    ", we explain how our scheme achieves same or better performance . in our setting , for nyquist sampling",
    ", the sampling rate should be twice of the one - sided bandwidth , which is @xmath83ghz . for existing compressed spectrum sensing schemes @xcite-@xcite , each node first obtains local sensing result .",
    "thus , the dimension of the local measured vector should be about @xmath88 the sparsity level to achieve exact recovery .",
    "this is the four - to - one practical rule well known to many cs researchers @xcite . as a result",
    ", the sampling rate should be four times of the occupied bandwidth , which is @xmath89ghz in our setting .",
    "we should point out that although the required sampling rate decreased a lot with previous compressed spectrum sensing methods , it is still too high for the resource - constraint crsn in the ultra - wideband regime .",
    "the novel idea of our scheme is to find a distributive compressed sampling structure , and further reduce the individual sampling rate . in our scheme , we effectively distribute the sensing load evenly to each crsn nodes by splitting the compressed sampling process , and acquire the sensing result at the fc .",
    "our individual sampling rate is @xmath31 and the sum sampling rate for a cluster is @xmath90 . with the same cs recovery algorithm ,",
    "the performance is mainly influenced by the sum sampling rate .",
    "in other words , the performance remains unchanged as long as @xmath90 is a constant .",
    "the decrease in @xmath31 will result in the increase of @xmath16 , and vice versa .",
    "we can allocate individual sampling rates that the sum sampling rate of all crsn nodes reaches four times of the occupied bandwidth .",
    "when @xmath91ghz , our scheme can achieve equivalent performance to existing compressed spectrum sensing schemes .",
    "for convenience of spectrum access , we choose the local sampling rate to be equal to the bandwidth of su subband , i.e. @xmath92mhz . as more crsn nodes engage in the sensing task , more robust performance can be achieved .",
    "for all the following monte carlo experiments , we repeat a hundred thousand times to compute the target value .     total bandwidth & 6 ghz + subband bandwidth & 30 mhz + occupied bandwidth & 900 mhz + total subbands & 201 + occupied subbands & 30 + occupation ratio & 15% +   + conventional nyquist sampling & 6 ghz + existing compressed spectrum sensing & 3.6 ghz + distributed compressed wideband sensing & 30 mhz +    _ 2 ) performance of compressed sensing _    in the first experiment , we examine the effect of measurement noise and @xmath16 on the recovery accuracy in terms of mse .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , we adjust the @xmath16 from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , and find that the mse drops as @xmath16 increases .",
    "it shows that , if too few measurements are collected , the performance of the compressed sensing algorithm will deteriorate .",
    ".,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    _ 3 ) performance of distributed wideband sensing _    in the second experiment , we evaluate the performance of distributed wideband sensing in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath95 versus the number of engaged crsn nodes @xmath16 .",
    "we adjust @xmath16 from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , and find that @xmath79 increases quickly , while @xmath95 drops .",
    "this implies that as more crsn nodes engaged in the sensing task , the detecting performance of the cluster improves .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.5 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    we also computed the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve under different @xmath16 .",
    "as shown in fig.6 , the closer the curve is to the upper left corner , the better the performance is .",
    "the four curves represent the cases when crsn nodes numbers are @xmath93 , @xmath85 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the performance improves as the engaging crsn nodes number @xmath16 grows .",
    "interestingly , we observe that as @xmath16 outnumbers @xmath4 by four times , the detector s performance is nearly optimal .",
