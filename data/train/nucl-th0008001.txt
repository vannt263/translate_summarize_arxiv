    "the electromagnetic production of kaons provides an important source of information on hadronic physics with strangeness . due to the rather weak coupling at the electromagnetic vertex ,",
    "the reaction operator is quite simple and , therefore , the use a of single channel analysis may be quite sufficient to describe the process . this process can be used to simultaneously study kaon - hyperon - nucleon coupling constants , isospin symmetry , hadronic form factors , baryon and meson resonances , and contributions of kaon - hyperon final states to the magnetic moment of the nucleon . in this report",
    "we will focus only on the two last topics .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the elementary operator we refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "the background part of the operator consists of the standard born terms along with the @xmath3(892 ) and @xmath4(1270 ) vector meson poles in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "the resonance part of the @xmath6 operator includes the @xmath7(1650 ) , @xmath8(1710 ) , and @xmath1 resonances .",
    "we also include hadronic form factors in hadronic vertices by employing the gauge method of haberzettl @xcite which leads to an excellent agreement between experimental data and model calculations .",
    "a brief inspection of the particle data table reveals that less than 40% of the nucleon resonances predicted by constituent quark models are observed in @xmath9 scattering experiments .",
    "quark model studies have suggested that those `` missing '' resonances may couple to other channels , such as the @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels .",
    "stimulated by the new @xmath12 saphir total cross section data @xcite , which suggest a structure around @xmath13 mev , we start the investigation by using our isobar model .    as shown in fig.[fig : missing ] , our previous model can not reproduce the total cross section . the constituent quark model of capstick and roberts",
    "@xcite predicts many new states around 1900 mev .",
    "however , only a few of them have been calculated to have a significant @xmath10 decay width @xcite .",
    "we have performed fits for each of the possible states , allowing the fit to determine the mass , width and coupling constants of the resonance .",
    "we found that only in the case of the @xmath14(1895 ) state couplings are obtained that are in remarkable agreement @xcite with recent quark model predictions .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : missing ] , where without this resonance the model shows only one peak near threshold , while inclusion of the new resonance leads to a second peak at @xmath15 slightly below 1900 mev , in accordance with the new saphir data .    in the case of @xmath16 photoproduction",
    "we find that a better agreement with experimental data can be achieved by including the @xmath1 resonance . as shown in fig.[fig : p13role ] the inclusion of this state does not influence the @xmath17 channel appreciably , in contrast to the other three @xmath18 channels , where the prominent effect is found in the @xmath16 channel .",
    "this is due both to the isospin coefficient which enhances the @xmath19 decay over the @xmath20 coupling and the very different structure of the born terms in @xmath21 photoproduction .",
    "the extracted fractional decay width is found to be consistent with the prediction of the quark model , whose magnitude is almost one order smaller than the value given by particle data group @xcite .",
    "the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite relates the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon @xmath22 to its excitation spectrum in the resonance region by an integral .",
    "previous analyses on pion photoproduction multipole amplitudes show a discrepancy between theoretical prediction and indirect experimental investigations of the gdh sum rule @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the contribution of kaon photoproduction processes to the gdh sum rule by using our isobar model .    in our previous calculation @xcite",
    ", we have fixed the upper limit of integration at 2.2 gev .",
    "exact formulation was obtained by integrating the structure function @xmath23 , and an approximation of the upper bound of integral is achieved by calculating total cross section @xmath24 .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that although this is relatively small , the result is consistent with the karliner s work @xcite .    in order to improve our gdh calculation",
    "we increase the upper limit of integration to higher energies . for the present",
    ", we use the regge model given in ref.@xcite to calculate the cross sections in the energy region between 5 and 15 gev .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : glv ] , where it is clear that contributions from higher energies are very small .",
    "nevertheless , the important message here is the convergence of @xmath23 which indicates the convergence of the integral in the case of kaon . in the future",
    ", we will improve our model by reggeizing the @xmath27channel intermediate state .",
    "some preliminary results have been reported in ref .",
