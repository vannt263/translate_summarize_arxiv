    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) has been regarded as one of the attractive new physics beyond the standard model , since it may provide a natural explanation to the stability of the electroweak scale against radiative corrections . however , contrary to our theoretical interests , any superpartner of the standard model particle has not discovered yet , and hence susy has to be broken in nature .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a clear picture of the susy breaking in nature , and the understanding of the origin of the susy breaking is one of the most important issues in the study of the supersymmetric models .    in recent years , a new framework for the susy breaking , i.e. , gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite , has been attracting many interests , and its phenomenological implications have been extensively investigated  @xcite . in particular , in gmsb ,",
    "susy breaking in the susy standard model ( ssm ) sector is mediated by the gauge interactions which do not distinguish flavors . in this scheme , dangerous off - diagonal elements in the sfermion mass matrices are suppressed , and serious susy flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem can be evaded .    in spite of the phenomenological interests , however , cosmology of gmsb is not fully satisfactory .",
    "in particular , relic abundances of the gravitino  @xcite and the moduli field  @xcite have been known to be problematic .",
    "these problems are often called `` gravitino problem '' and `` cosmological moduli problem . '' in some sense , they are more serious than the gravity mediated susy breaking case , and they may be crucial weak points of gmsb .",
    "( these issues will be reviewed in the next section . )",
    "however , one should note that there are rooms to solve or improve these difficulties ; since these difficulties are based on a kind of `` minimal '' assumption , some of them may be solved or relaxed by a new idea .",
    "for example , thermal inflation  @xcite is proposed to dilute the unwanted particles .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to propose a new mechanism for a large entropy production , which can be a resolution to the cosmological problems in gmsb .",
    "our scenario is based on a class of models with direct gauge mediation in which the messenger particles have a direct coupling to the original susy breaking field . in particular , recently , several direct gauge mediation models are proposed in which susy breaking field has exactly flat potential at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "( for other classes of models of direct gauge mediation , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in this class of models , minimum of the potential of the susy breaking field is determined by the inverted hierarchy mechanism  @xcite , and susy breaking field has a very flat potential even after the potential is lifted . in this case ,",
    "susy breaking field may play an important role to dilute unwanted particles ; with an assumption that the susy breaking field has an initial amplitude of the order of the planck scale , various cosmological problems can be naturally solved .",
    "one virtue of this scenario is that the source of the large entropy production is already in the framework of the susy breaking mechanism .",
    "therefore , the scenario is fairly economical , and we do not have to introduce any new field only for the entropy production ( like `` flaton '' ) , contrary to the case of thermal inflation  @xcite . in the following sections , we see how this works , and consider if we may have a cosmologically consistent scenario .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "overview ] , we give an overview of the cosmological difficulties in gmsb .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : model ] , we briefly review the important aspects of the direct gauge mediation model with the inverted hierarchy mechanism .",
    "in particular , the susy breaking field plays a very important role in our discussion , so we see the properties of the potential of the susy breaking field in some detail . in section",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , cosmology based on the direct gauge mediation model with the inverted hierarchy mechanism is discussed . in particular , we concentrate on the cosmological evolution of the susy breaking field , and we discuss how it improves the cosmological difficulties .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discussion .",
    "before discussing the cosmology of the direct gauge mediation model , let us first briefly overview the cosmology of the gauge mediation model .",
    "cosmologically , one important outcome of the gmsb is the light gravitino ; the gravitino mass @xmath0 in this scheme has to be much lighter than the ssm scale @xmath1 .",
    "this is because mass squared matrices of sfermions have off - diagonal elements of @xmath2 .",
    "if this effect is comparable to the dominant contribution from gmsb , dangerous susy fcnc problem arises again , which spoils the important motivation of gmsb .",
    "consequently , the gravitino becomes the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) in this scenario .    keeping this feature in mind ,",
    "one of the most famous cosmological constraint in gmsb is from the mass density of the gravitino in the universe .",
    "if the gravitino is thermalized in the early universe , and if it is not diluted , its mass density may significantly contribute to the energy density of the universe . without dilution , mass density of the gravitino",
    "is proportional to @xmath0 , and the universe is overclosed if the gravitino mass is heavier than about 1  kev  @xcite .    with an enough entropy production after the decoupling of the gravitino from the thermal bath , gravitino mass heavier than 1  kev",
    "may be also viable .",
    "however , even in this case , the gravitinos are produced in the thermal bath due to scattering and decay processes .",
    "these secondary gravitinos also contribute to the mass density of the universe , and hence gravitino production after the entropy production has to be inefficient .",
    "since the gravitino production is more effective for higher temperature , we obtain an upper bound on the maximal temperature of the universe after the late entropy production in order not to overclose the universe  @xcite .",
    "notice that the interaction of the longitudinal gravitino with matter is proportional to @xmath3 , and hence the constraint becomes weaker for a heavier gravitino . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_grvtno ] , we show the upper bound on the maximal temperature @xmath4 as a function of the gravitino mass ; the upper bound is from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , for the gravitino mass 1  kev  1  gev . in particular , the constraint is very strict in the case of @xmath7 , where the gravitinos are mainly produced by the decay processes .",
    "if the universe starts with a temperature higher than this upper bound , the universe is overclosed by the gravitino , unless there is an enough entropy production below this temperature .",
    "= 0.5    more serious problem arises in the framework of superstring models . in superstring models , dilaton and moduli fields ( which we call `` moduli '' fields hereafter )",
    "exist which are the flat directions related to symmetries in the superstring theory .",
    "mass of the moduli field originates to susy breaking effect , and is of the same order of the gravitino mass .",
    "( throughout this paper , we approximate the mass of the moduli field to be the gravitino mass @xmath0 . )",
    "generically , moduli field takes an initial amplitude of the order of the planck scale , unless our vacuum lies at or near a point of enhanced symmetry  @xcite .",
    "then , it starts oscillation when the expansion rate of the universe becomes comparable to the mass of the moduli field . since the interactions of the moduli field are suppressed by inverse powers of the planck scale , moduli field lighter than about 100  mev",
    "has a lifetime longer than the present age of the universe . in gmsb",
    ", this is ( almost ) always the case . in this case ,",
    "mass density of the moduli field becomes enormous , if there is no dilution .",
    "assuming the radiation dominance before the moduli field starts to move , naive calculation results in the density parameter of the moduli field as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km / sec / mpc , @xmath10 is the effective number of the massless degrees of freedom when the moduli field starts to move , @xmath11 is the reduced planck scale , and @xmath12 is the initial amplitude of the moduli field .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 , the initial amplitude has to be smaller than @xmath14 in order not to overclose the universe , and this is an extreme fine tuning of the initial condition . in other words , if the initial amplitude takes the natural value ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , a large entropy production is inevitable for a viable cosmological scenario .    even if we adopt a large entropy production to dilute the gravitino and the moduli field away , it is still non - trivial whether a consistent cosmological scenario can be obtained .",
    "if there is a large entropy production , it also dilutes the possible baryon asymmetry generated in the early stage of the universe . naively speaking",
    ", baryon number asymmetry has to be generated after the entropy production .",
    "however , in some case , the reheating temperature after the entropy production becomes too low for baryogenesis . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been pointed out that affleck - dine mechanism for baryogenesis  @xcite may be able to generate enough baryon asymmetry even if there is a large entropy production .",
    "this topics is reviewed later .",
    "candidates of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) is another interesting issue in gmsb . in",
    "the gravity mediated susy breaking scenario , the lightest neutralino  @xcite or sneutrino  @xcite can be a promising candidate of the cdm , if it is the lsp .",
    "however , in gmsb , they can not be the cdm , since they can decay into gravitino and their superpartner .",
    "several candidates of the cdm are proposed in the framework of gmsb  @xcite , but these candidates are also diluted by the entropy production . one interesting candidate is the coherent oscillation of the moduli field , if its energy density is diluted enough .",
    "therefore , it is very important to consider the possibility to dilute the energy density of the moduli field down to @xmath16 .",
    "another class of cosmological problems are related to the structure of the scalar potential ; the scalar potential may have unwanted minimum which is deeper than the phenomenologically viable local minimum .",
    "for example , original low energy gauge mediation model may have a color breaking minimum  @xcite , and the models proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite have a susy preserving true vacuum at the origin of the potential of the susy breaking field .",
    "usually , the tunneling rate to the true vacuum can be so small that the transition does not happen for the time scale of the age of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is phenomenologically consistent once the susy breaking field is trapped in the minimum we want .",
    "however , cosmologically , we have not understood how the susy breaking field is trapped in the relevant ( local ) minimum , not in the unwanted ( global ) one . in particular ,",
    "if we assume a naive susy breaking phase transition , many horizons choose the unwanted deeper minimum , and the current horizon contains many regions which dropped into the unwanted minimum .",
    "notice that it is unclear whether the thermal inflation could solve this problem , even though the reheating temperature after the thermal inflation is relatively low .",
    "this is because the current horizon scale contains many different horizons before the thermal inflation .",
    "therefore , even if the susy breaking phase transition occurs before the thermal inflation , current horizon still contains many regions of unwanted minimum .    keeping these arguments in mind",
    ", it is important to develop a cosmologically consistent scenario based on gmsb .",
    "importantly , one should remember that above problems are usually based on `` minimal '' assumption , and in particular in direct gauge mediation model , the above arguments do not take account of a possible effect from the susy breaking field . in the following sections , we will see what happens if we include its effects .",
    "in this section , we first briefly review the class of models we are interested in . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we consider a cosmology of the direct gauge mediation model in which the potential of the susy breaking field is stabilized by the inverted hierarchy mechanism . in this section",
    ", we discuss the general features of such models  @xcite .",
    "an explicit example of the model is shown in appendix  [ app : example ] .",
    "the model is based on the symmetry @xmath17 . here , g@xmath18 is the strong gauge interaction whose dynamics induces the gaugino condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "g@xmath19 is introduced to stabilize the minimum of the potential of the susy breaking field , and g@xmath20 is the standard @xmath21 gauge croup . in this framework , we introduce the following class of chiral superfields in order to induce a desired dynamics to break susy : the susy breaking field @xmath22 which transforms under g@xmath23 , `` messengers '' @xmath24 which transform under g@xmath25 and g@xmath20 , and `` strongly interacting '' fields @xmath26 which transform under g@xmath18 and g@xmath25 .",
    "these chiral superfields have a superpotential of the form @xmath27 notice that this superpotential has @xmath28-symmetry which is non - anomalous for @xmath29 ; under this @xmath28-symmetry , @xmath22 has charge @xmath30 .",
    "as we will discuss later , this @xmath28-symmetry is explicitly broken by supergravity effect .",
    "we construct a model so that @xmath22 has a flat direction which is parameterized by an invariant made out of @xmath22 . on this flat direction , g@xmath23 is broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath22 .",
    "the first requirement to the model is that , on this flat direction , all but one degrees of freedom in @xmath22 are eaten by higgs mechanism .",
    "we parametrize the remaining degrees of freedom by @xmath31",
    ".    on this flat direction , chiral superfields coupled to @xmath22 also acquire masses .",
    "this effect changes the @xmath32-function of g@xmath33 at @xmath34 , since @xmath35 and @xmath36 have mass of @xmath37 and decouple at this scale . as a result ,",
    "the strong scale for the theory above @xmath38 , @xmath39 , differs from that after @xmath35 and @xmath36 decouples , @xmath40 .",
    "these two quantities are related as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dynkin indices for the adjoint and @xmath26 representations of g@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the second requirement to the model is that these dynkin indices satisfy the relation @xmath45 , so that the linear superpotential is induced by the gaugino condensation ; below the strong scale , effective superpotential is induced by the gaugino condensation as @xmath46 therefore , if @xmath45 , superpotential is linear in @xmath31 , and supersymmetry is broken by the vev of the @xmath47-term of the @xmath31 field ; @xmath48 .",
    "( this class of model of susy breaking is originally discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    with the above superpotential , scalar potential is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the derivative with respect to @xmath31 , @xmath51 is the khler potential , and @xmath52 is the wave function renormalization of @xmath22 . at the tree level , @xmath53 , and",
    "hence @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath31 . in this case ,",
    "vev of @xmath31 is undetermined .",
    "however , once we include the radiative corrections , the situation changes . since @xmath22 interacts through gauge and yukawa interactions , non - trivial khler potential is induced by radiative correction .",
    "@xmath31 dependence of @xmath52 is governed by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) . at the one loop level ,",

    "the important point is that the gauge and the yukawa contributions have opposite signs in the @xmath32-function of @xmath52 . as we can see in eqs .",
    "( [ v_global ] ) and ( [ dz / dt ] ) , gauge contribution makes @xmath52 larger at higher energy and drives @xmath59 to a larger value , while yukawa contribution affects in the opposite way . as a result , if the gauge piece dominates the @xmath32-function in the low energy , and also if the effect of the yukawa terms wins in the high energy , @xmath31 has a minimum at @xmath60 where the @xmath32-function vanishes : @xmath61    therefore , in this class of models , potential for @xmath31 is stabilized by the scale dependence of the wave function renormalization factor @xmath52 . at the minimum , @xmath47-component of the @xmath31 field",
    "has a non - vanishing vev of @xmath62 , and susy is broken .",
    "then , fermionic component of @xmath31 becomes the goldstino , and in supergravity , it is absorbed in the gravitino . in this case ,",

    "@xmath73 should be in the range of @xmath74 ; the lower bound is from experimental lower bounds on the masses of the superparticles , while the upper bound is from the naturalness point of view .    in the following discussions , we use @xmath65 and @xmath73 as independent parameters in the model , and rewrite other quantities as functions of them .",

    "another constraint is from the stability of the susy breaking minimum . in some class of models",

    "however , most importantly , strong dynamics does not break the @xmath28-symmetry , and hence the properties of the @xmath28-axion is unchanged .",
    "consequently , evolution of the @xmath28-axion is basically unaffected , even if the non - perturbative effect becomes important at the minimum of the potential . with these caveats in mind",
    ", we also consider the case with @xmath88 in the following discussion .",
    "in this case , we make an implicit assumption that the minimum of the potential is stabilized even after taking account of the non - perturbative effect .    finally , we comment on the upper bound on @xmath65 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ m_grav ] ) , gravitino mass becomes larger than @xmath89 for @xmath90 with @xmath91 . in this case ,",
    "supergravity contribution to the sfermion masses becomes comparable to the gauge mediation piece , and hence susy fcnc problem arises again .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 is required to solve susy fcnc problem .      in order to discuss the cosmological implication of @xmath31 , it is important to understand the properties of its potential , which is the subject of this subsection",
    ".    we are interested in the models in which the minimum of the @xmath31 field is determined by the inverted hierarchy mechanism . in this class of models , the potential at the global level is only lifted by the renormalization group effects , and hence it can be expanded by powers of @xmath93 : @xmath94   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv &    f_x^2 \\left [    \\frac{\\zeta_1 ( \\mu)}{16\\pi^2 } \\ln\\frac{x^*x}{\\mu^2 }    + \\frac{\\zeta_2 ( \\mu)}{(16\\pi^2)^2 }    \\left(\\ln\\frac{x^*x}{\\mu^2}\\right)^2    + \\cdots \\right ] ,   \\label{v_expansion }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath95 here , @xmath96 is a @xmath97-th polynomial of gauge and yukawa coupling constants .",
