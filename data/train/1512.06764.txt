    "considerable efforts have been directed towards the development of effective methods of minimization of this functional @xcite .",
    "this method was extended in our previous works to the two - dimensional problem for the waveguide with the piecewise - constant refractive index and an arbitrary cross - sectional boundary @xcite .",
