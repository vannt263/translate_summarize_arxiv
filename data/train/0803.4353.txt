    "efforts are underway to use the antarctic icecap as a neutrino target@xcite .",
    "neutrino - ice collisions result in the production of charged particles which emanate from the collision point at @xmath1 . in a medium with index - of - refraction @xmath2 , detection of the resulting cherenkov radiation in either the near - uv or radio wavelength regime by a suite of sensors can be used to reconstruct the kinematics of the initial neutrino , provided the absorption and refraction of the original electromagnetic signal due to the intervening ice can be reliably estimated .",
    "complete characterization of the ice permittivity , as a function of depth and also polarization is therefore important in obtaining a reliable estimate of the neutrino detection efficiency .    for a radio receiver array",
    ", sensitivity is optimized by probing a large mass ( i.e. , large neutrino target ) of cold ( long attenuation length ) , uniform ( minimal sensitivity to systematic errors resulting from local anisotropies ) clean ( no scattering ) ice .",
    "although surface elevations vary across the continent , ice thicknesses are typically @xmath03 km for most of the potential radio array sites , as indicated in table [ thickness - data ] .",
    "thanks to its superb infrastructure , south polar ice is perhaps the most extensively characterized at a single site@xcite .",
    "our current study represents an extension of previous ice dielectric measurements at south pole .",
    ".data ( taken from the bedmap collaboration ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have checked the uniformity of the observed reflection return waveforms , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : wf - comparison ] . for this figure ,",
    "signals have been scaled by the appropriate scale factor needed to match the peak voltage to that observed at @xmath3s .",
    "if the reflection coefficients were uniform , we would expect the ratios of ( @xmath4 ) to be approximately 1 .",
    "instead , we observe a ratio of ratios somewhat less than 1 , indicating non - uniformity of the reflection coefficients at the internal scattering layers .        in the frequency domain ,",
    "the observed reflected signal retains most of the initially broadcast signal in the frequency regime above the highpass filter ( figure [ fig : fft_hrn2hrn07.eps ] ) .",
    "assuming that the reflection coefficient is frequency - independent , this is qualitatively consistent with our earlier study , which indicated only slight dependence of attenuation length with frequency .",
    "three obvious factors can , in principle , be responsible for the observed cross - polarized signal strength . these factors , which have different time dependences , are : a ) cross - talk between the h and v polarization response of the antenna ( time - independent ) , b ) layer - specific reflection characteristics ( specific at the time of a given reflection ) , and c ) faraday rotation , essentially equivalent to birefringence of circularly polarized waves .",
    "( proportional to pathlength ) .",
    "note that , since a given material experiences a positive(/negative ) phase rotation when the @xmath5-vector is parallel(/anti - parallel ) to the applied magnetic field , the phase rotation is ( in general ) not canceled over a round - trip path .",
    "( this conclusion is not changed if one assumes an inversion of the wave when reflected off a higher index - of - refraction medium . ) in general , although birefringent effects will project onto ordinary and extra - ordinary axes , it will not result in a cross - polarized signal , although the received signal strength will be modulated due to interference effects , if the receiver time resolution is sufficiently coarse .    for a given material in a magnetic field @xmath6 , the phase advance @xmath7 due to faraday rotation through a pathlength @xmath8",
    "is expressed in terms of the verdet constant as : @xmath9 . for a given material ,",
    "the verdet constant can be expressed in terms of the bohr magneton as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the index - of - refraction of the material .",
    "using @xmath12 over the wavelength interval of interest@xcite , we obtain ( mks units ) , @xmath13=0.02 rad/(m - t ) at 300 mhz , in which case this is unlikely to be a significant effect . due to its dependence on pathlength , faraday rotation can therefore be directly probed by plotting the ratio of the cross - polarized amplitude to the co - polarized amplitude as a function of time delay . although the phase of the cross - polarized signal observed reflecting off discrete internal layers shows no obvious pattern ( e.g. , the 13.9 microsecond ( /17.2 microsecond ) + 90 degree co - polarized reflected signal is in phase ( /out of phase ) with the cross - polarized signal ) , the ratio of amplitudes ( figure [ fig : vratio ] ) indicates a suggestive modulation with period @xmath08 microseconds .",
    "interpreted as pure faraday rotation , this would indicate a @xmath14 polarization axis rotation for each 800 m of traversed ice depth .        as a cross - check of the apparently large power being fed from one polarization into the cross - polarization , we also attempted to broadcast using a long dipole transmitter instead of the horn tx , aligned along two orthogonal axes ( corresponding to zero and 90 degrees , respectively ) .",
    "given the lower forward gain of the dipoles , and the poorer frequency - response matching , we observe only the return at @xmath15s , with approximately equal amplitude ( figure [ fig : greentx2hrn ] ) in co - pol vs. cross - pol orientations .",
    "figure [ fig:2004-copol - xpol ] shows the co - polarized vs. cross - polarized data taken previously , in january 2004@xcite .",
    "although not noted at the time , the clear presence of the scattering layer around 14 @xmath16s is evident from the figures , as well as the presence of large amplitude signals in the cross - polarization configuration , not necessarily present in the co - polarization configuration .",
    "the horn orientation is approximately 160 degrees , in the coordinate system used for our current measurement .",
    "we note that , in our previous study conducted at taylor dome , although direct evidence was observed for birefringence in scattering of radio waves off the bedrock , no clear returns from internal layers , prior to the bedrock reflection , were evident .",
    "using publicly available data from the cresis group , based at the university of kansas , we have also attempted to extract evidence for birefringent effects based on their greenland ice thickness aerial survey data . since the cresis data includes the aerial velocity vector as data",
    "are taken , we have searched for a statistical separation between the depth recorded when the plane is flying parallel to the known ice - flow direction ( taken from @xcite ) vs. perpendicular to the known ice - flow direction .",
    "figure [ fig : grz-1997.eps ] shows the results of this study .",
    "the rms of these distributions ( @xmath010 m , or @xmath0100 ns in total in - ice travel time ) is insufficient to discern clear evidence for the sought - after birefringent asymmetry .",
    "there has been increasing attention given to birefringence as responsible for radio - frequency interference effects observed in antarctic ice .",
    "having made a similar measurement at taylor dome , our goal in this analysis was to directly measure birefringence , as indicated by a time - delay between reflected signals received along two orthogonal azimuthal polarizations . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "internal scattering layers were used as reflecting planes , which offered the possibility of correlating time - delays between successive reflecting planes with the crystal orientation in those intermediate layers . no obvious evidence for birefringence is observed .",
    "if true , this conclusion supports the suitability of the south pole as a radio - based neutrino detection site , compared to other locales across the antarctic continent , where birefringent effects have been claimed .",
    "we do observe a variation in scattered signal , as a function of azimuth , as previously detected in a similar , albeit frequency - based , measurement .",
    "our results , however , disfavor that amplitude variation as a birefringent - related effect , and may require further investigation of the chemical and electrical properties of internal scattering layers .",
    "there is , in fact , some data available on dust layers at the south pole@xcite , however we have not made a conclusive correlation between layering observed in this study and layers observed in previous studies .",
