    "a classical result of differential geometry states that if two surfaces , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in @xmath2 intersect with constant angle along a line of curvature of @xmath0 , then the curve of intersection is also a line of curvature of @xmath1 . in 1846",

    "our methods are motivated by topology : the ultimate goal is to investigate whether a knot in the boundary of a 4-manifold is the boundary of a properly embedded disc - the slice problem . as a new geometric model , we propose subsets of @xmath11 and invariants derived from the neutral khler structure , which we claim can be utilized to detect obstructions to sliceness .    for surfaces in @xmath2 ,",
    "umbilic points are generically isolated and have a half - integer index associated with them given by the winding number of the principal foliation about the umbilic point .",
    "let @xmath15 be a disc with non - umbilic boundary and only isolated umbilic points in the interior .",
    "the total umbilic index @xmath16 is defined to be the sum of the umbilic indices on @xmath15 and when the boundary of @xmath15 is non - umbilic , it is equal to the winding number of the principal foliation along @xmath17 .    from our perspective , umbilic points on @xmath18 correspond to complex points on @xmath9 and the total complex index @xmath19 of the corresponding disc in @xmath11 with totally real boundary is a smooth topological invariant @xcite .",
    "thus our main theorem can be restated as : @xmath20 alternatively , our result provides a situation where one can bound this invariant by geometric data at the boundary hypersurface .",
    "further results on this topic and its relation to the slice problem will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be smooth convex surfaces which intersect along a curve @xmath3 at a constant angle @xmath21",

    "@xmath11 admits a canonical neutral khler structure @xmath22 that is invariant under the induced euclidean action @xcite , and , since @xmath11 is diffeomorphic to @xmath23 , write @xmath24 for @xmath11 endowed with this structure .",
    "the surfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 will be treated differently : define @xmath25 to be the set oriented lines that intersect @xmath0 , forming an angle @xmath13 with the outward normal , and define @xmath26 be the set of oriented lines normal to @xmath1 .",
    "clearly these are 3- and 2-dimensional submanifolds of @xmath24 , the latter being diffeomorphic to a 2-sphere while the former is diffeomorphic to a circle bundle over the 2-sphere .    the submanifolds @xmath14 and @xmath9 intersect transversely along the curve @xmath27 which consists of the oriented normal lines to @xmath1 along the curve @xmath28 .",
    "the constant angle condition in @xmath2 has been translated to an intersection condition for certain submanifolds in @xmath24 .",
    "we now describe the geometric properties of these submanifolds .    starting with @xmath9 , the set of oriented normals to the convex surface @xmath1 .",
    "this is a lagrangian section of the bundle @xmath29 and is locally described by the gradient of the support function @xmath30 .",
    "we now utilize local holomorphic coordinates @xmath31 on @xmath24 to describe this - see @xcite and references therein for further details .",
    "the complex coordinate @xmath32 is the standard holomorphic coordinate on @xmath33 giving the direction of the oriented line , while the complex coordinate @xmath34 gives the perpendicular distance of the line to the origin .",
    "together they yield @xmath35 the surface @xmath9 is the section @xmath36 where @xmath37 and this is lagrangian as @xmath38 define @xmath39 if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the radii of curvature of @xmath1 , then @xmath42 thus umbilic points on @xmath1 are precisely the complex points on @xmath9 , while the half of the argument of @xmath43 determines the principal directions of the surface @xmath1 .",
    "now suppose we have an oriented line @xmath61 and a point @xmath62 on this line .",
    "thus , for some @xmath63 @xmath64 suppose further that @xmath31 is another oriented line that passes through @xmath62 and forms an angle @xmath13 with @xmath61 .",
    "the former fact means that : @xmath65 substituting the expressions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and for @xmath68 from lemma [ l:1 ] , we conclude that the set of oriented lines that intersect @xmath61 at a parameter @xmath69 , forming an angle @xmath13 , is a circle in @xmath24 parameterized by @xmath53 as follows @xmath70 where @xmath12 .      by assumption @xmath9 and @xmath10 intersect in the curve @xmath71 , consisting of the oriented normal lines to @xmath1 along the curve of intersection @xmath72 .",
    "parameterize the curve so that @xmath3 is given by equations ( [ e : coordu ] ) where everything now depends upon a parameter @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 and @xmath75 where we have used equation ( [ e : pot1 ] ) and the definitions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "identical expressions hold for the derivatives of @xmath76 and @xmath77 with all subscripts changed from 1 to 2 .      to fix unit parameterization of the curve @xmath3 set @xmath78,\\ ] ] for @xmath79 .",
    "the curve @xmath71 of oriented lines are tangent to @xmath3 iff @xmath80 or @xmath81 , while , the oriented lines are normal to @xmath3 iff @xmath82 or @xmath83 .    in summary , the intersection curve @xmath71 in @xmath24 is the solution to the two complex equations @xmath84 where all quantities depend on @xmath73 . in the second equation we use the given graph function @xmath85 , and similarly for @xmath76 .",
    "thus we have five real unknowns encoded in @xmath86 and four real equations , yielding a one dimensional solution set parameterized by @xmath73 .",
    "differentiate the second equation of ( [ e : int ] ) with respect to @xmath73 and use equations ( [ e : dr1 ] ) , ( [ e : unitpara ] ) and ( [ e : xi2dot ] ) , along with ( [ e : deta1 ] ) and the analogous equation for @xmath76 .",
    "the result , after some computation and rearrangement , is @xmath89\\nonumber\\\\ & + ( e^{ia_1}-\\epsilon\\xi_1)^2\\psi_2\\bigg[2\\epsilon\\kappa_1\\frac{d a_1}{du }     + \\epsilon(\\epsilon e^{2ia_1}+e^{ia_1}\\xi_1)\\sigma_1\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+(e^{-ia_1}\\epsilon\\bar{\\xi}_1- e^{-2ia_1})\\bar{\\sigma}_1     -(\\epsilon(e^{ia_1}\\bar{\\xi}_1+e^{-ia_1}\\xi_1)+\\epsilon^2 - 1)\\psi_1\\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad-(1+\\epsilon^2)\\kappa_1(e^{ia_1}-\\epsilon\\xi_1)^2=0.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      to transfer this to back to euclidean 3-space , denote the principal curvatures of @xmath0 by @xmath92 and those of @xmath1 by @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the angle between the principal direction of @xmath0 and the intersection curve and @xmath95 the corresponding angle on @xmath1 .",
    "the last equation can now be succinctly written @xmath96 thus we obtain joachimsthal s theorem : @xmath3 is a line of curvature on @xmath0 iff it is a line of curvature on @xmath1 .",
    "a further result of joachimsthal s also follows : if @xmath0 is a sphere ( so that @xmath97 ) and the surface @xmath1 intersects it at constant angle , then @xmath98 and so @xmath3 is a line of curvature on @xmath1 .",
    "note that this equation states that the geodesic torsion of the intersection curve on the two surfaces are equal @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath3 contains no umbilic points on @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the winding numbers of the maps @xmath99 count the total umbilic index inside the curve on each surface , where the inside is determined by the outward pointing normals - see theorem 4 of @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , write @xmath100 and @xmath101 so that the derivative of equation ( [ e : final ] ) with respect to @xmath73 is @xmath102 if @xmath103 everywhere along the curve then the winding numbers of the principal foliations are equal and the theorem holds .",
    "otherwise , choose a point @xmath104 such that @xmath105 . by a deformation of the surfaces preserving constant angle we can also assure that @xmath106 ( an open condition ) .    by a choice of parameterization of the intersection curve",
    "@xmath3 we can set @xmath107 to be @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , by a rotation of the complex coordinates @xmath32 we can set @xmath110 . then @xmath111 and @xmath112 for some @xmath113 . each principal foliation is orientable or non - orientable along @xmath3 according to whether the winding numbers @xmath114 or @xmath115 is even or odd , respectively .    now evaluating equation ( [ e : las2 ] ) at @xmath108 and @xmath109 we find @xmath116 since none of @xmath117 or @xmath118 vanish at @xmath107 , both of these equations hold only if @xmath119 for some @xmath120 .",
    "thus the foliations are both orientable or both non - orientable , as claimed ."
