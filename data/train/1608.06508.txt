    "general relativity ( gr ) is parity - free . however , in particle physics and string theory , the anomaly cancellation motivates the gravitational chern - simons ( gcs ) term @xcite@xcite ( see @xcite for the review ) , which is the leading - order parity - violating correction to gr ( see also @xcite@xcite for the weyl tensor ) .",
    "thus the chirality of gravity might be a universal property of the uv - complete theory ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the primordial gws @xcite@xcite , predicted by inflation , may induce the b - mode polarization in the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) , and carry rich information about the early universe and the uv - complete gravity theory , e.g. , @xcite@xcite@xcite . during inflation ,",
    "the primordial gws generally originate from the vacuum fluctuation of the metric .",
    "the parity - violation of gravity induces chiral gws @xcite , i.e. , the left- and right - handed gws modes propagate with different behaviors .",
    "however , in models of inflation in which a pseudoscalar field interacts with the gauge field @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the gauge field is also the source of parity - violating gws .",
    "these two sources seem undistinguishable .    during inflation",
    ", the running of the propagating speed of gws will result in oscillating shapes @xcite@xcite@xcite or a blue tilt @xcite in the gws spectrum .",
    "similarly , the chirality will also be manifested in the primordial gws spectrum @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , which may bring the tb / eb - mode correlation in cmb @xcite@xcite . due to the importance of the parity - violating correction of gravity for the particle physics and string theory",
    ", it is significant to search for its unique observable fingerprint .    in this paper , we show that if the gcs term couples to a massive scalar field ( @xmath0 ) , the primordial gws will show itself the chirality oscillation , i.e. , the amplitudes of left- and right - handed gws modes will convert into each other and oscillate in their propagations .",
    "this is a novel phenomenon of the chirality of gravity , which has not been uncovered before .",
    "we illustrate the implications of the chirality oscillation to the primordial gws spectrum , and its imprints in the cmb b - mode polarization .",
    "we begin with the quadratic action for the tensor perturbation s_=dd^3x,[lhh ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the planck scale and @xmath4 is the higher - order derivative corrections with the parity violation . considering only the leading order terms",

    ", @xmath22 is required , otherwise the ghost modes will appear at the cutoff scale @xmath23 , see @xcite .",
    "initially , the perturbations are deep inside their horizon , i.e. , @xmath24 , thus @xmath25 .",
    "the power spectrum of primordial gws is p_t^(s)=k^32 ^ 2|_^(s)|^2 , 1 .",
    "the chiral parameter @xmath26 reflects the intensity of parity violation of primordial gws .",
    "when @xmath6 or @xmath27 , @xmath28 with different polarizations will have different evolutions , the primordial gws are chiral . in sting theory , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "actually are moduli - dependent , see @xcite , and the massive moduli fields ( @xmath29 ) are ubiquitous .",
    "generally , the single field slow - roll inflation is thought as the effective model after all massive modes are integrated out .",
    "however , during inflation , the massive fields could be excited and oscillate around its minimum .",
    "this will inevitably induce the chirality oscillation of the primordial gws , which could be encoded in the power spectrum of primordial gws , as will be showed .",
    "we will illustrate the idea of the chirality oscillations with a workable model in detail , in which the background is set as the inflation with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a massive modulus field with s_=m_p^22d^4x ( -12_^-v()+f()4m_p^2rr ) , where @xmath32 is the gcs term .",

    "the amplitudes of the left- and right - handed gws mode oscillate almost ( but not exactly ) symmetrically , and will eventually arrive at different values .",
    "this difference with respect to the comoving wave number is reflected in the oscillation of @xmath64 , see fig . [ fig003](c ) .",
    "it is also noticed that the broken symmetry of the evolutions of left- and right - handed gws modes , i.e. , @xmath65 , actually also imprint an oscillating fingerprint in @xmath66 , as was showed in fig . [ fig003](b ) .",
