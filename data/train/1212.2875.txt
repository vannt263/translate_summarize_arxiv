    "this paper continues our series where we try to build on and generalize an idea by prokofev and svistunov @xcite on alternate ways of formulating and simulating simple statistical systems and euclidean lattice field theories . in our context , their idea has two aspects .",
    "one is that , instead of summing over the field configurations in the original form , one exactly rewrites the models as a finite or infinite sum over associated strong coupling or high ( classical ) temperature graphs .",
    "the second aspect for spin models is , that enlarging the class of such graphs from those of the partition function to a larger set associated with the two point correlation function makes simulations ( ` diagrammatic monte carlo ' ) both simpler and much more efficient with respect to critical slowing down . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that we may in addition exploit some freedom to design the enlarged ensemble to our advantage and thus achieve an excellent signal to noise ratio for interesting observables .",
    "it is this aspect that we will extend in this paper to polyakov line correlators in abelian gauge theories while critical slowing down is unfortunately not eliminated at the same time .",
    "some remarks are in order here .",
    "the standard usage of strong coupling expansions is to evaluate a truncated series for some suitable observables and then take the thermodynamic limit _ within this approximation_. these expansions in powers of some @xmath0 usually have finite radii of convergence related to singularities or phase transitions . in systems with a large but finite number of compact degrees of freedom however , these expansions _ converge _ for many quantities like for instance the partition function itself .",
    "therefore , for such systems  and we never simulate anything else  the untruncated set of strong coupling graphs furnishes an _ exact _ reformulation of the theory in which we can attempt to apply stochastic summation methods . for a given action or hamiltonian the graphs derived from it reproduce finite lattice observables exactly and not just universal features . for spin models we thus encounter representations in terms of loops drawn on the lattice and the obvious generalization to gauge models studied here",
    "consists of surfaces .",
    "the admissible graphs are restricted by constraining rules , for instance on the number of lines that may touch at a site , and we sum over such constrained objects .",
    "solving the constraints in terms of independent new variables would complete our reformulation to a duality transformation , which is however not done in @xcite .",
    "what the reformulations have in common is that rather different observables may be advantageously computed in one or the other . in models similar to ising models duality",
    "@xcite relates the strong coupling expansions in one model to the weak coupling expansion in another .",
    "it is trivial , but amusing to remark , that a diagrammatic monte carlo of the weak coupling ( low temperature ) expansion of an ising model is nothing but a standard simulation , as spin - flip related pairs of configurations correspond to one naive weak coupling graph . in the systematic weak coupling approximation one",
    "just truncates these contributions guided by the size of their boltzmann weights .",
    "our previous work in this series extended the method from the ising model @xcite to the o(@xmath1 ) , cp(@xmath2 ) models and to fermions , see @xcite for an overview and more references . for fermions",
    "an unsolved sign problem hampers simulations in more than two dimensions while in the other cases the technique is expected to be efficient in arbitrary dimension .",
    "studies of o(@xmath1 ) as a special case of certain loop graph models on particular lattices are also found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there have been other recent attempts to apply the ` worm ' method to abelian gauge models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the important new feature in the present study is in our mind however , that we succeed in generalizing the low noise estimators for fundamental correlations from spin to gauge systems .",
    "also the rle of twisted boundary conditions on the torus will be discussed which leads to interesting topological universal finite size observables .",
    "as we get access to precise results for polyakov line correlators , a comparison with low energy effective string models suggests itself as a first interesting application of our simulation technique .",
    "such studies form an active research area and we here offer a demonstration of the usefulness of our method in the context .",
    "a very profound such study is beyond the scope of this publication .",
    "the field has a long history with a boost , as far as we see , after the papers by lscher and weisz @xcite , @xcite which interestingly were also triggered by algorithmic improvement .",
    "the low energy description of large wilson and polyakov loops in confining gauge theories was pushed to the two loop level in the spirit of a general effective field theory approach reminiscent of chiral perturbation theory vis a vis qcd .",
    "it was found that to this order and in three dimensions and taking into account all symmetries , no free low energy coupling constants enter .",
    "this investigation was later even extended to the three loop level in @xcite so that we have remarkable absolute predictions to check with our low noise long distance results for the polyakov loop correlator .    for the z(2 )",
    "ising gauge theory in three dimensions that we adopt here as a test case , there actually exists an enormous body of precise results in the literature , see @xcite , @xcite for recent papers with further references . here",
    "the duality of the gauge theory with the spin model is exploited and the simulations are conducted there .",
    "the method is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "a wilson loop in the gauge theory translates into a ratio of partition functions in the spin model differing by flipped bonds .",
    "such a ratio is factorized into many ratios differing in single bonds , which are evaluated in separate simulations .",
    "while this is an intrinsically three dimensional method , the same is not true for our more direct approach , although we here test it in @xmath3 as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 .",
    "we introduce the model , its boundary conditions , rewrite it as a surface ensemble and collect some formulae of the effective string description .",
    "this is followed by the development of our monte carlo method for the surface ensemble in section 3 . and a report of our numerical experiments in section 4 .",
    "we end on conclusions in section 5 . and an appendix listing numerical data .",
    "in this section we setup our model on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath4 euclidean dimensions .",
    "we include the definition of fluctuating twisted boundary conditions .",
    "then we introduce the one - to - one reformulation as a surface model , which generalizes the loop ( re)formulation of spin models .",
    "we consider a gauge field @xmath5 defined on the links of a @xmath4-dimensional hypercubic periodic lattice of extent @xmath6 in directions @xmath7 .",
    "the standard wilson action is defined on plaquettes @xmath8 by @xmath9 = \\beta \\sum_{x , \\mu < \\nu } p \\left ( x , \\mu , \\nu \\right )    \\sigma ( x , \\mu ) \\sigma ( x + \\hat{\\mu } , \\nu ) \\sigma ( x + \\hat{\\nu } , \\mu )    \\sigma ( x , \\nu ) .\\ ] ] the plaquette dependent background field @xmath10 will be useful later and may be first imagined to be unity until further notice .",
    "generalized periodic boundary conditions demand that the gauge field is periodic up to gauge transformations @xcite @xmath11 specified by fixed ` external ' transition functions @xmath12 . because the shifts form an abelian group it is necessary that shifts @xmath13 come with the same gauge transformation as the double shift in the opposite order , which however still leaves the possibility @xmath14 the case @xmath15 is possible because the action of @xmath16 on gauge fields is independent of the global sign of the transition function .",
    "then we have twisted boundary conditions in the @xmath17 plane while we call planes with @xmath18 untwisted or just periodic below .",
    "if we gauge transform @xmath19 in the ordinary sense , this implies the following change of the transition functions @xmath16 @xmath20 they transform like parallel transporters on a set of ` super - lattices ' with spacings @xmath6 . the @xmath21",
    "represent the gauge invariant content of the transition functions .  for a given set of twists @xmath22 we now define reference transition functions @xmath23 where we round upwards to an integer ( ` ceil ' ) in the exponent",
    ". then the product @xmath24 has trivial twist and can be gauged to unity .",
    "hence we may assume that the transition functions have the form @xmath25 and then the gauge field is periodic except ( possibly ) for @xmath26 by a further change of variables , we may arrive at fully periodic @xmath27 again if we absorb signs into @xmath28 with _ periodic _ @xmath29 symbols ( period @xmath30 respectively ) .",
    "thus for each twisted plane we have a @xmath31 dimensional set ( stack ) of negative plaquettes that represent a background flux or disorder ( ` vortices ' ) concentrated on a line , sheet , ... for @xmath32 .",
    "this step is analogous to absorbing antiperiodic boundary conditions into a background gauge field , see @xcite for example .",
    "next we introduce the partition function with current insertions @xmath33",
    "= 2^{- n_l } \\sum_{\\sigma } { \\mathrm{e}}^{- s [ \\sigma ,    p_{\\gamma } ] }   \\prod_{x , \\mu } \\sigma ( x , \\mu)^{j ( x , \\mu ) } .",
    "\\label{ztj}\\ ] ] in this formula we sum over strictly periodic @xmath34 independently at all @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a periodic external field .",
    "the number of independent sites , links , plaquettes and 3-cubes ( for later use ) is @xmath38 performing a local gauge change of variables ( [ gtrho ] ) with periodic @xmath39 one derives @xmath33",

    "as @xmath43 can be arbitrary this shows that only divergence free currents ( in the z(2 ) sense ) , for which @xmath44 holds at all sites , yield nonzero @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "in addition we may flip the gauge field @xmath46 on any @xmath47 dimensional hyperplane @xmath48 orthogonal to the @xmath36-direction ( ` layers ' ) .",
    "a similar argument as before yields the requirement that the layer sums @xmath49 must be even for all layers , which are hence pierced by an even number of current quanta .",
    "equivalently we may say that the link field @xmath50 must have vanishing z(2 ) winding number with respect to all torus directions .    using @xmath51 for each plaquette",
    ", we introduce a field @xmath52 .",

    "the proof looks slightly funny , for example @xmath63 an easy to interpret case is a configuration @xmath64 .",
    "then the plaquettes @xmath65 form a surface which may branch and consist of disconnected components .",

    "this is similar to just flipping links around plaquettes in the strong coupling loop representation of ising spin models .",
    "a natural generalization of the worm algorithm @xcite would be to allow to ` open up ' vacuum graphs and allow excursions to the enlarged state space of ( allowed ) @xmath122 ( possibly traversing ` useful ' configurations regarding observables of interest ) and eventually returning to a vacuum graph .",
    "we have a long record of not really successful experiments of this type , see @xcite for experiments with u(1 ) gauge theory . in z(2 ) we have simulated correct ergodic algorithms where we included a chemical potential per defect link @xmath123 to control their number .",
    "we could find values that have led to ensembles of randomly shaped ( typically irregular ) wilson loops where also vacuum configurations ( re-)appeared at a reasonable rate .",
    "none of these attempts has so - far led however either to fast dynamics or to easily interpretable observables .",
    "therefore we come up with the hybrid below which combines cube flips with polyakov line pair defects only where we have to tolerate however some critical slowing down .",

    "can be small acceptance rates for the shifts in ps , if @xmath96 is large .",
    "after all we propose nonlocal albeit only one - dimensional changes to the configuration .",
    "simulating @xmath154 lattices at the critical point , we indeed find acceptances falling with @xmath155 which reach values of about 1.6% only for @xmath156 .    in @xcite a so - called rejection - free version for general worm - type algorithms",

    "a1nr we need to replace beside ps @xmath162 psnr also the cf step by one , where the boltzmann ratio corresponding to ( [ zznr ] ) is formed for the acceptance step .",
    "finally also a version a2nr is programmed , where @xmath163 is suitably generalized to depend on the direction of the defect lines . since in any case the relative weights of _ vacuum _ graphs are the same in ( [ polens ] ) and ( [ zznr ] ) all expectation values ( [ mean0 ] ) are as before .",
    "we see that the term ` rejection free ' refers to the polyakov shifts in non - vacuum configurations only .",
    "acceptance rates in cf are however at efficient levels in all our simulations .",
    "if now the remaining acceptance rate of psnr out of vacuum gets too small , we may exploit our freedom of choosing @xmath43 to improve this .",
    "for example the choice @xmath164 with @xmath165 reduces the relative weight @xmath166 of vacuum configurations and thus enhances the probability to leave them .",
    "a few brief experiments allowed us to arrange for reasonable acceptance rates for these moves , too .",
    "we find this simple choice for @xmath43 to be a good one at the critical point , where we will implement a2nr , while in the confined phase in connection with a1 other choices will be more favorable .",
    "we first report on a number of simulations at @xmath167 which corresponds to the dual of the estimate given for the spin model in @xcite . on each lattice of sizes",
    "@xmath168 we have executed @xmath169 iterations of a2nr with @xmath43 from ( [ rhoc ] ) and @xmath170 after a few tests .",
    "all observed acceptance rates of cf are around 50% and the remaining acceptance of ps out of vacuum configurations drops from 34% at @xmath171 to 23% at @xmath172 with these choices .",
    "one of the simplest observables is the average fraction of plaquettes participating in the random surface of vacuum configurations @xmath173 which is analogous ( and equivalent , see ( [ e0 ] ) ) to the average plaquette .",

    "[ figconf ] we visualize a typical graph occurring in  the @xmath171 simulation , larger systems look even more cluttered .",
    "histograms counting the frequencies of separations @xmath153 are accumulated after each individual ps step and turn out to be rather flat , as expected in the critical theory , where the polyakov correlation decays only slowly .    during each iteration of a2nr",
