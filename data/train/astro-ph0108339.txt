    "massive gas components whose total masses are @xmath3 are widely observed in the central kpc and sub - kpc regions of various galaxies .",
    "such a massive gas component plays an important role in such nuclear activity as nuclear starbursts , galactic superwind , and agns .",
    "however , the structure of the massive gas disk , or its relation with star - formation and fueling processes in the agn region , are not yet understood .",
    "for example , the millimeter interferometers , do not have fine enough spatial resolution to reveal detailed structure of the molecular gas in the central 100 pc region of nearby galaxies .",
    "hopefully this situation will drastically change in the next decade ; using the next generation millimeter and submillimeter interferometer ( @xmath4 ) , the spatial resolution is improved to @xmath5 arcsecond , and we expect to be able to know pc - scale structures of the molecular gas in the central regions of nearby galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "our theoretical understanding of the ism in the central sub - kpc region is still insufficient .",
    "the ism in the central region should not simply be approximated as a one - phase fluid or an ensemble of discrete clumps .",
    "we should use a more realistic treatment for the ism in the central region to reveal how the structure of the ism relates to the nuclear activity . recently",
    "@xcite ( hereafter wn99 , wn01 ) presented high - resolution , 2d numerical models of the ism in a kpc - scale galactic disk , in which they numerically solve hydrodynamical equations and the poisson equation with realistic radiative cooling and heating .",
    "star - formation and its energy feedback on the ism are implemented in their numerical code .",
    "they found a quasi - stable structure of the ism where various temperatures and density phases of the gases coexist .",
    "its velocity field resembles that of compressible turbulence .",
    "however the 2d approximation used in wn01 would not be relevant for the 3d ism , especially for the vertical structure of the hot gas component @xcite in the central region of galaxies .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report on a first attempt to understand 3d structure of the ism in the galactic central region , taking into account self - gravity of the gas , galactic differential rotation , radiative cooling , and heating due to uv background radiation and supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the numerical methods are basically the same as those described in wn01 . here",
    "we briefly summarize them .",
    "we solve the following equations numerically in three dimensions to simulate the evolution of a rotating ism in a fixed gravitational potential .",
    "@xmath6 & = &   \\gamma_{\\rm uv } + \\gamma_\\star- \\rho \\lambda(t_g ) , \\label{eqn : en}\\\\ \\nabla^2 \\phi_{\\rm sg } & = & 4 \\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqn : poi } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath7 are the density , pressure , and velocity of the gas , and the specific total energy @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we assume a time - independent external potential @xmath10 , where @xmath11 pc is the core radius of the potential and @xmath12 km s@xmath13 is the maximum rotational velocity .",
    "we also assume a cooling function @xmath14 @xmath15 @xcite with solar metallicity and a heating due to photoelectric heating , @xmath16 and due to energy feedback from sne , @xmath17 .",
    "we assume a uniform uv radiation field , which is ten times larger than the local uv field @xcite : @xmath18 where the heating efficiency @xmath19 is assumed to be 0.05 and @xmath20 is the incident fuv field normalized to the local interstellar value .",
    "the hydrodynamic part of the basic equations is solved by ausm ( advection upstream splitting method ) , @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath21 cartesian grid points covering a @xmath22 pc@xmath23 region around the galactic center .",
    "therefore , the spatial resolution is 0.5 pc .",
    "the poisson equation is solved to calculate self - gravity of the gas using the fft and the convolution method .",
    "the second - order leap - frog method is used for the time integration .",
    "we adopt implicit time integration for the cooling term .",
    "the initial condition is an axisymmetric and rotationally supported thin disk of a uniform density profile ( thickness is 2.5 pc ) with a total gas mass of @xmath24 ( initial average density is about @xmath25 @xmath26 ) .",
    "random density and temperature fluctuations are added to the initial disk .",
    "these fluctuations are less than 1 % of the unperturbed values and have an approximately white noise distribution .",
    "the initial temperature is set to @xmath27 k over the whole region .",
    "sn explosions are assumed to occur at random positions in the region of @xmath28 pc and @xmath29 pc .",
    "the average sn rate is 4.8 yr@xmath13 kpc@xmath30 , which is as high as that in nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "the energy of @xmath31 ergs is instantaneously injected into a single cell as thermal energy . during the calculation ( @xmath32 myr ) , about @xmath33 sne explodes .",
    "we do not assume simple evolutionary models for each snr or for the heating efficiency of the ism due to sne .",
    "the 3d evolution of blast waves caused by sne in an inhomogeneous and non - stationary medium with global rotation is followed explicitly , taking into account the radiative cooling .",
    "therefore the evolution of the snrs , e.g. the duration and structure of the sne , depends on the gas density distribution around the sn .",
    "computational time for one typical run is about 30 hours using a vector parallel supercomputer ( 9.6 gflops / processor @xmath34 32 processors ) .",
    "figure 1 ( a ) shows the 3d density distribution of the disk in a quasi - stable state ( @xmath35 myr ) . dense filaments / clumps form a `` tangled network '' .",
    "high density clumps colored yellow are embedded in less dense filaments colored blue .",
    "low density regions occupy a larger volume than the dense components .",
    "the morphology does not differ much from that found in 2d global models ( wn01 ) .",
    "the formation process of the complicated structure is the same as in the 2d case ( see fig .",
    "6 in wn01 ) .",
    "a number of processes are involved in the formation of the filamentary structure : 1 ) tidal and collisional interactions between dense regions formed due to thermal and gravitational instabilities , 2 ) differential rotation , 3 ) shear motion due to local turbulent motion , and 4 ) sn explosions . the last mechanism is not a dominant process in the disk plane , where the radiative cooling is very effective due to the high gas density , and most of the sn energy is used to form vertical structure ( see below ) .",
    "radial surface density distribution in the quasi - steady state is fitted on average by an exponential profile : @xmath36 pc@xmath30 , with @xmath37 pc .",
    "this is a consequence of the angular momentum transport due to the turbulent motion in the disk .",
    "velocity dispersion in the plane is @xmath38 km s@xmath13 over the whole disk .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) is an edge - on view of the density distribution .",
    "vertical distributions of average density and temperature are also shown .",
    "the dense , cold gases form a geometrically thin disk , where the average temperature is about @xmath39 k. note that most of the volume is occupied by cold ( @xmath40 k ) gas near the disk plane ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , but warm and hot regions ( @xmath41 ) increase the average temperature .",
    "the dense disk has a diffuse envelope , where the volume average temperature is about @xmath42 k. the diffuse gases form plume - like structures outside the dense thin disk , which are direct results of sn explosions occurring near the disk plane .",
    "the vertical structure is quasi - steady in a global sense .",
    "that is , the kinetic and thermal heating due to sne balances with the radiative cooling followed by infall of the cooled gas towards the disk .",
    "it looks like a miniature of the `` galactic fountain '' model @xcite",
    ".    it would be useful to estimate a typical radius of snrs for understanding what causes the density structures .",
    "a radiative snr becomes in a pressure - driven snowplow ( pds ) phase when the radius of the snr is @xmath43 pc@xmath44 pc @xcite .",
    "the maximum radius of the shell at the end of the snowplow phase is @xmath45 pc , where the ambient pressure @xmath46 @xmath26 k ) .",
    "the velocity field of the medium is turbulent - like due to the random energy input from sn explosions , and the vertical rms velocity is @xmath47 km s@xmath13 , which is comparable to that estimated from the evolution of shock velocity of a snr ( @xmath48 ) after 1 myr evolution . if we use the turbulent pressure @xmath49 as @xmath50 , @xmath51 pc .",
    "since @xmath52 at the pds phase , the remnant reaches its maximum size at @xmath53 myr . above estimate",
    "implies that the snrs can not be larger than 1 pc near the disk plane where the average density is much greater than 100 @xmath54 pc@xmath55 .",
    "sne that explodes at several pc above the disk plane may cause 10 pc - scale _ vertical _ structures as seen in fig .",
    "note that the present spatial resolution ( 0.5 pc ) might not be fine enough to resolve the early evolution of snrs in very dense regions .",
    "figure 2 is the temperature distribution ( a ) at the disk plane ( @xmath56 ) , and ( b ) at @xmath57 pc at @xmath58 myr . in the disk plane , most gases are in a cold ( @xmath59 k ) , while on the other hand , warm ( @xmath60 k ) and hot phases ( @xmath41 k ) create a patchy morphology above the disk plane .",
    "the hot gas originates in sn explosions .",
    "the uv radiation contributes to form the warm , diffuse gas , but it does not significantly affect the gas dynamics . since the radiative cooling in the dense regions near @xmath61 is effective , the snrs are less prominent near the disk plane than in the halo region . although the spatial structure of the density is quite complicated as seen in fig .",
    "1 , statistically the system is rather simple . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the probability distribution function of the density , i.e. a histogram of volume as a function of the gas density .",
    "the pdf is well fitted by a single log - normal function over about seven orders of magnitude between @xmath62 pc@xmath55 , which suggests strong non - linearity in the formation process .",
    "figure 4 is the volume - weighted temperature pdf .",
    "there are two dominant phases at @xmath63 k and @xmath27 k , which are thermally stable phases determined by the cooling functions ( see fig . 1 in wn01 ) .",
    "the cold gas around @xmath63 k corresponds to the point @xmath64 , above which the system is expected to be thermally unstable @xcite .",
    "there are also small peaks at @xmath65 and @xmath66 k. the latter is a direct result of sn explosions .",
    "the system roughly shows three phases in temperature .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a considerable amount gas exists between the cold and warm phases which are thermally unstable regimes .",
    "this can not be understood by the behavior of multi - phase gas in pressure equilibrium , but as a consequence of turbulent motions in the medium . as in the 2d case",
    "( see fig . 13 in wn01 ) , the thermal pressure is dominated by turbulent pressure in this system .",
    "@xcite concluded from their 2d simulations that the turbulence smears out the thermal phases , creating a continuous distribution of the physical properties .",
    "this is consistent with our 3d results .",
    "we have examined the 3d density and temperature structure of a massive gas component in the central 100 pc region of a galaxy .",
    "we found that a globally stable , multi - phase disk is formed as a natural consequence of non - linear evolution .",
    "the structure is similar to what has previously been found in 2d simulations for a kpc - scale disk ( wn99 , wn01 ) .",
    "the sn explosions are assumed to be as high as those in nuclear starbursts , but they do not drastically change the intrinsically inhomogeneous `` tangled '' network density structure near the disk plane ( @xmath61 ) . however , the sne are important in producing the vertical structure , i.e. the diffuse filamentary halo ( @xmath67 pc@xmath55 ) , and the hot component ( @xmath68 k )",
    ". we also found that the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) is well fitted by a single log - normal function over about seven orders of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that the density structure is dominated by a highly non - linear process from low to high density regimes @xcite .",
    "probability density functions ( pdfs ) have been discussed in relation to the structure of the turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite indicated a formal proof for the log - normal pdf in isothermal supersonic turbulence .",
    "they also showed numerically that the log - normal pdf appears in 3d isothermal , non - self - gravitating supersonic turbulence over about three orders of magnitude .",
    "in our system , on the other hand , thermal and gravitational instabilities play an important role to produce the very dense regions .",
    "the pdf can be fitted by a log - normal function over seven orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we believe that the isothermality is not a necessary condition for the log - normal pdf , but it is a natural feature of the highly non - linear and random processes , which are achieved in the system that we are investigating , i.e. , the self - gravitating , supersonic turbulence with radiative cooling and stellar energy feedback .",
    "however , an important open question remains : what determines the `` width '' of the log - normal pdf ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the standard deviation of the log - normal pdf measures the mean rate of change of the density or r.m.s .",
    "mach number of the turbulence .",
    "since the density range in which the log - normal pdf is achieved in our system is quite large , and self - gravity of the gas is crucial for yielding the very high density regions , it is not likely that the r.m.s .",
    "mach number is the only parameter needed to determine the width of the log - normal pdf .",
    "wn01 reported that the density pdf in 2d models can be fitted with a log - normal function for a high density region over about four orders of magnitude , but that the low density part is fitted by a normal function . in the present 3-d model",
    ", we do not find that the pdf for a low density region obeys the normal distribution .",
    "the difference between the 2d and 3d results would suggest that the third dimension is more important for less dense gases .    finally , the density structure of the massive disk with sne is interesting in terms of the starburst - agn connection .",
    "if the gas system around the agn is inhomogeneous as seen in the present model , then the nucleus could be obscured by the dense clumps and filaments from a certain line - of - sight .",
    "the turbulent motion in the disk causes mass inflow towards the nucleus , and the accretion rate would be time - dependent , and would also depend on the star formation rate in the disk ( wada & norman , in preparation ) .",
