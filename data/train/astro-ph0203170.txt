    "the existence of spiral galaxy bulges with boxy or peanut shapes has been recognized for many years through the study of edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work has found that edge - on galaxies with prominent boxy or peanuts shaped bulges in most cases show kinematic evidence for non - circular motions associated with a bar , whereas galaxies lacking boxy or peanut shaped bulges do not show kinematic evidence for a bar @xcite .",
    "a few cases exist where highly inclined systems exhibit both bars and peanuts ( e.g. , ngc 7582 , @xcite and ngc  4442 , @xcite ) . the link between a galactic bar and a boxy / peanut shaped bulge has been firmly established .",
    "mechanisms proposed to explain the formation of boxy and peanut shaped structures include accretion of small satellite galaxies @xcite , bar - buckling via the fire - hose type instability @xcite and resonant heating @xcite . the fire - hose",
    "( bar - buckling ) instability is a global time dependent instability which relies on the centrifugal force caused by highly eccentric orbits in the plane caused by the bar and is damped via a dissipative process similar to landau damping @xcite .",
    "the resonant heating model has been inspired by the study and classification of orbit families in 3-dimensional systems @xcite and through the phenomena displayed in n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "no study has yet considered the evolution of 3 dimensional stellar orbits in a barred system that is varying with time . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility that the growth of the bar itself traps particles in the vertical inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) .",
    "we develop a simple hamiltonian analytical model for these resonances and use it to predict the vertical distribution of a bar following the growth of the bar .",
    "our approach of considering resonance trapping is similar to that explored by @xcite for disk heating .",
    "however their model is for the general case of a growing axisymmetric disk , whereas our model applies specifically to a growing bar perturbation .",
    "to exihibit resonant phenomena @xcite showed that the hamiltonian must be expanded to at least third order in the epicyclic approximation .",
    "when this is done there are higher order cross terms in the action variables and the model will exhibit phenomenology such as the bifurcation of orbit families seen in characteristic diagrams which are created through numerical integration of orbits .",
    "we first consider the hamiltonian lacking non - axisymmetric or time dependent perturbations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gravitational potential which is assumed to be axisymmetric and @xmath2 are the momenta conjugate to the cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "for the 2 dimensional problem restricted to the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ) , @xcite showed how to put the hamiltonian in the form @xmath5 in a third order epicyclic approximation .",
    "the action variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 are integrals of motion .",
    "@xmath8 is the particle s angular momentum , and @xmath9 is the angular momentum of a particle in a circular orbit at a radius @xmath10 which is the radius of a circular orbit with energy @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the epicyclic angle and @xmath13 is the azimuth of the epicyclic center . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angle variables conjugate to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath17 the angular rotation rate ; both are evaluated at @xmath18 .    to extend the theory into the third dimension we must add additional terms to the restricted hamiltonian which depend upon @xmath19 ; @xmath20 we expand the potential @xmath1 about @xmath19 and @xmath10 defining the variables @xmath21 which are evaluated at @xmath22 . inserting this into the full hamiltonian we find @xmath23 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where we have made use of the relations @xmath24 , @xmath25 and both @xmath17 and @xmath16 are evaluated at @xmath18 .",
    "for this hamiltonian following @xcite we can choose a third action variable @xmath26 to represent the amplitude of vertical oscillations .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vertical oscillation frequency and @xmath29 is the angle associated with the vertical oscillations .",
    "the above expressions are given to first order in @xmath30 and require higher order terms to be exact .",
    "after a couple of canonical transformations ( see appendix ) the hamiltonian to second order in @xmath30 takes the form @xmath31 since this is independent of the angles @xmath32 , the momenta @xmath33 are conserved quantities and we say we have put the non - perturbed hamiltonian , ( eqn .  [ hz ] ) , in action angle form .",
    "we now consider the form of the perturbation of the gravitational potential caused by a bar . in the plane of the galaxy",
    "we can expand the gravitational potential in terms of fourier components @xmath34 ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest term due to the bar should be the @xmath35 term with @xmath36 so that the bar major axis lies along @xmath37 for small @xmath19 we assume that the potential can be expanded so that we can write for each @xmath38 fourier component @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the scale height of the perturbation .",
    "we also assume that @xmath41 and @xmath40 vary only weakly with radius . since @xmath42 we can rewrite the perturbation components to second order in @xmath30 @xmath43    we focus on the particular resonance that we expect is important and ignore all the other terms .",
    "@xmath44    to go into a coordinate system with an angle that librates when a particle is trapped in the resonance we do a canonical transformation with the following generating function @xmath45\\ ] ] so that our resonant angle and new momenta @xmath46 and @xmath13 is unchanged .",
    "our generating function is time dependent ; @xmath47 .",
    "following this canonical transformation our hamiltonian becomes @xmath48 j_3   + { \\lambda",

    "however the hamiltonian is similar to that of j+2:j orbital resonances studied by @xcite .",
    "orbits captured in the 2:1 vertical ilr were seen in the numerical simulations of @xcite however they expected the resonance to be first order in @xmath53 rather than second order as we have found here . by symmetry the gravitational potential when expanded should not contain terms proportional to @xmath19 , and so terms @xmath54 , unless we consider a global instability such as the fire - hose bar buckling instability .",
    "indeed @xcite found that a temporal @xmath19-symmetry breaking ( due to a collective effect ) would make the resonance first order .",
    "@xcite reported that n - body simulations which forced @xmath19-symmetry did grow boxy / peanut shaped bulges but more slowly than those which did not force the symmetry .",
    "unless the galaxy is extremely thin and the bulge small we expect that the 2:1 vertical ilr will occur in the inner region of the bar ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that the 1:1 vertical ilr will be present .",
    "the 2:1 vertical ilr produces banana - shaped orbits , referred to as ban in the characteristic diagrams of @xcite and the 1:1 vertical ilr produces titled orbits that are referred to as anomalous ( ano ) by @xcite .",
    "if the galaxy is very thin it is also possible that there will be orbits associated with the 4:1 vertical ilr @xcite .",
    "if we concentrate on the 2:1 vertical ilr then the perturbation term from the bar that is relevant is the @xmath55 fourier term ; if we focus on the 1:1 vertical ilr then the @xmath35 term is relevant .",
    "it has long been known that bars exhibit significant @xmath55 fourier components and contain boxy or square contours when projected onto the plane of the galaxy @xcite . from figure 4 by @xcite",
    "we estimate that the @xmath55 fourier component of the barred galaxy ngc 4314 the potential peaks at @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 and at @xmath58 in the same units .",
    "we can use these as typical values for the potential perturbations in a barred galaxy .",
    "we now transform equation ( [ h_simple ] ) so that our coefficients are unitless .",
    "we put length in units of @xmath59 , the center of the resonance where @xmath60 and time in units of @xmath61 .",
    "our action variables are in units of @xmath62 so we define @xmath63 .",
    "we divide the entire hamiltonian by @xmath64 so that our new hamiltonian becomes @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and we have assumed that the vertical form of the potential can be approximated by @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 should be negative because the vertical oscillations are expected to be slower for particles traveling well above the galactic plane .    for a bar with a peak @xmath69 , as estimated from ngc 4314 .",
    "@xmath70 at the the 2:1 resonance , and @xmath71 at the 1:1 resonance .",
    "we estimate that @xmath72 peaks at @xmath73 for both resonances because @xmath74 .",
    "barred galaxies have an observed ratio of bar length to peanut length of @xmath75 @xcite . measurements of the ratio of bar length to thickness give a typical value of @xmath76 @xcite with the measurement of @xcite being on the high end at @xmath77 , and the milky way bar likely to be lower than the typical value . using these typical values",
    "we estimate that @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79    we expect the resonance to be important in the region where @xmath80 or across a range @xmath81 ; @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes a derivative with respect to radius . if @xmath84 and @xmath85 varies slowly with radius then the resonance can be felt over a significant range of radius .",
    "given the definition of our variables we estimate that the expectation value @xmath86 from figure 1 we infer that when @xmath87 the minimum value of vertical oscillations occurs for the fixed points at @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore expect the maximum height of the the peanut to be at @xmath87 where @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 this implies a peanut width of order @xmath91 where we gain the factor of 2 when we consider orbits of both signs ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is sufficiently large to explain the observed vertical extent of boxy / peanut shaped bulges .",
    "as shown by @xcite the resonance contains 3 separate regions . to show the separate regions we use a coordinate system @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "contours of constant @xmath11 ( eqn .",
    "[ ham_j3 ] ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "for @xmath96 three fixed points exist , for @xmath97 two fixed points exist and for @xmath98 only one fixed point exists .",
    "orbits circulating around @xmath99 correspond to banana - shaped orbits with positive @xmath19 at the ends of the bar , and orbits correspond to banana - shaped orbits with negative @xmath19 at the ends of the bar .",
    "as shown in figure 8b of @xcite banana shaped orbits appear on the characteristic diagram at a particular value of the hamiltonian , consistent with them appearing at a particular value of @xmath100 . for orbits circulating around the origin , the resonant angle , @xmath101 ,",
    "circulates ; referred to as oscillation as opposed to libration in analogy with a pendulum .",
    "we consider the signs of each term in eqns.([h_simple],[ham_j3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath102 but we expect that @xmath103 .",
    "consequently @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath84 has the opposite sign of @xmath85 .",
    "because @xmath28 and @xmath17 increase at small radii we expect @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "we see from fig.1 that near @xmath109 no orbits exist with low values of @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that all orbits will rise out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "as @xmath84 decreases the mininum size of the vertical oscillations increases until @xmath111 , then orbits with small amplitude vertical oscillations appear again .",
    "the vertical extent of the galaxy should increase until a particular radius and then drop abruptly ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this would naturally correspond to a bowtie or peanut shape when viewed edge - on .      to explore the simple model given in eqn.([ham_j3 ] )",
    "we integrate particle trajectories assuming that the perturbation is growing . in other words",
    "we assume that @xmath112 begins at zero and reaches a maximum value a few rotation periods later .",
    "we begin the integrations with a particle distribution @xmath113 and with angle @xmath101 randomly chosen between 0 and @xmath114 .",
    "4000 particles were integrated using eqn.([ham_j3 ] ) for the simulations shown in figures 36 .",
    "the growth time for the perturbation is given in periods where @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath116 , @xmath117 is about 1/3 the bar growth time in units of the vertical oscillation period .    in the adiabatic",
    "limit the capture probability of a region of phase space depends upon the ratio between the rate that phase space volume is swept across the separatrix bounding this region divided by the rate that phase space volume is swept across the entire separatrix bounding the entire resonance @xcite . for @xmath107 phase space",
    "initially looks like the panel on the bottom right of fig .  1 and then moves upward on this figure . when the separatrix touches the particle distribution centered at the origin , particles are captured into librating regions near @xmath92 and @xmath118 ( see figures 34 ) .",
    "for @xmath119 phase space initially looks like the panel on the top left of figure 1 and then moves downward on this figure . when @xmath120 particles at low @xmath110 are captured into the librating regions around @xmath121 .",
    "figures 34 illustrate that smoother particle distributions are achieved when the growth rate is faster ( shorter number of periods @xmath117 ) as we would expect when the variation is no longer adiabatic , and when the initial momentum distribution is wider ( larger @xmath122 ) .    given a distribution in @xmath110 and @xmath101 resulting from the growth of the perturbation we can predict the vertical distribution as a function of azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy . for a value of the resonant angle @xmath101 and an azimuthal angle @xmath123 in the plane of the galaxy in the frame rotating with the bar ,",
    "@xmath29 is determined via eqn.([res_angle ] ) and @xmath19 is then determined from the definition of our action angle variables ( eqn .",
    "[ zdef ] ) . in figure 5",
    "we show vertical distributions for the action angle distributions shown in figures 3 and 4b for @xmath35 and in figure 6 we show the equivalent but for @xmath55 .",
    "we see from figures 5 and 6 that the vertical height reaches a maximum near @xmath124 as we expected from the form of the resonance .",
    "the height increases slowly between @xmath125 to @xmath126 and then drops swiftly , confirming conceptually our bowtie picture shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for @xmath35 ( shown in figure 5 ) corresponding to the 1:1 vertical ilr , the major axis of the bar becomes bulbous , as would be expected from a sum of anomalous orbits of both orientations ( shown in figure 7 ) . for @xmath55 ( shown in figure 5 ) corresponding to the 2:1 vertical ilr",
    ", both the major and minor axes of the bar have increased vertical heights .",
    "again this is expected from a sum of banana - shaped orbits of both orientations ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "observations of peanut shaped galaxies where both the bar and the peanut are observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the ends of the peanut are aligned with the bar .",
    "so it could be that the 1:1 resonance orbit family is more likely to explain the bulbous ends of boxy / peanut shaped bulges .",
    "however when the radial oscillations of the galaxy are taken into account the banana - shaped orbits may still be viable , particularly if the extent of their vertical oscillation is smaller along the minor axis than it is along the major axis .",
    "we remind the reader that in section 2.1 we dropped the last term in eqn.([hz_can ] ) which is proportional to @xmath127 . as a bar grows the epicyclic amplitude @xmath14 of the stars will grow .",
    "this has the effect of shifting the location of the vertical resonance so that @xmath85 becomes @xmath128 for a flat rotation curve @xmath129 so we expect that @xmath85 will be more negative than expected if this additional term is neglected .",
    "this has the affect of moving the resonance outward in radius .",
    "one reason that the 2:1 ilr resonance was considered a logical choice for exciting the peanut is that when the galaxy is thin the 1:1 may only occur at extremely small radii , well inside the galaxy bulge .",
    "however the estimates for the resonance locations were made assuming @xmath130 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the point here is that the growth of the epicyclic amplitude will shift the location of the vertical resonances outwards so that the lower order resonances may manifest at larger radii than previously considered .",
    "it is possible that the growth of the bar causes the vertical resonances to sweep through the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "we have presented a simple hamiltonian dynamical model for the vertical inner lindblad resonances in the presence of a bar perturbation .",
    "the hamiltonian model is similar to that introduced by @xcite to describe the 2:1 lindblad resonances in the plane of the galaxy but uses the vertical action angle variables . using this model we consider the growth of a boxy / peanut shaped bulge via resonance trapping in the vertical inner lindblad resonances caused by the growth of the bar . following the growth of the bar ,",
    "our model predicts that the height of the peanut increases as a function of radius until it reaches a maximum at the outermost radius which is set by the condition @xmath87 .",
    "our model naturally accounts for the sharp outer edge of observed boxy / peanut shaped bulges .",
    "the maximum total vertical width of the peanut is of order @xmath131 which we estimate for a typical bar could be about two thirds @xmath59 , where @xmath59 is the radial location of the resonance .",
    "this model is therefore capable of accounting for the observed widths of boxy / peanut shaped bulges .",
    "the scenario explored here suggests that the boxy / peanut shaped bulge is grown at the same time as the bar forms .",
    "we predict that recently formed bars should manifest strong boxy / peanut shaped bulges and barred galaxies should never be found without boxy / peanut shaped bulges . if the boxy / peanut shapes take nearly a hubble time to grow , as found in the n - body simulations of @xcite , then there should be barred galaxies which lack boxy / peanut shaped bulges .",
    "however @xcite considered a control sample of edge - on galaxies lacking boxy / peanut bulges .",
    "no examples of barred galaxies that lack a boxy / peanut shaped bulge have yet been identified .",
    "@xcite found that the boxy / peanut only required 3 - 4 bar growth periods to grow and this could be significantly shorter , only a few gyrs .",
    "if this timescale were more appropriate then the lack of barred galaxies which do not display boxy / peanut shaped bulges is less of a problem .",
    "one way to probe the formation timescale of the boxy / peanut is to search for barred galaxies which have recently formed bars .",
    "if boxy / peanuts require many rotation periods to form then these barred galaxies should have normal ( non - boxy ) bulges . because of the high rate of star formation along the bar @xcite inferred that ngc 7582 was a case of a recently formed bar .",
    "they pointed out that the galaxy bulge did show a strong prominent peanut and so argued that boxy / peanut shaped bulges are formed quickly after the onset of a bar .",
    "observations of edge - on galaxies are therefore consistent with a rapid boxy / peanut formation mechanism such as we have proposed here",
    ".    our scenario does not require the galaxy to buckle in order to form the boxy / peanut shaped bulge .",
    "the fire - hose instability scenario for bar - buckling ( beautifully illustrated in 3d n - body simulations by @xcite ) predicts that the galaxy will literally be bent in a u - shape while the galaxy buckles , however no examples of u - shaped edge - on galaxies have been identified in galaxy surveys ( with the exception of galaxies which are believed to be ram pressure stripped in clusters ) .",
    "it is likely that the period of time during which the galaxy is u - shaped is short .",
    "however galaxy collisions have a similar estimated lifetime and are detected in nearby galaxy surveys .",
    "we note that @xcite reported that n - body simulations with fixed @xmath19-symmetry did grow boxy / peanut shaped bulges , though at a slower rate than unconstrained simulations .",
    "we have constructed an analytical framework which can be used to predict the height distribution of the peanut as a function of radius and the azimuthal angle in the galaxy plane .",
    "the nature of the dependence is primarily determined by the resonance responsible for the vertical excitations .",
    "a 3 dimensional study of a nearby boxy bulge ( such as that seen in our galaxy ) could determine which resonance is most likely to be responsible .",
    "the shape of the boxy / peanut shaped bulge is also sensitive to the dependence of the gravitational potential on height from the mid - plane and on the way the bar grew .",
    "further study of boxy / peanut shaped bulges may allow us to place constraints on the vertical shape of the galaxy and on the early evolution of the bar .",
    "the toy model introduced in this paper was designed to illustrate the process of resonance * capture * during the growth of a bar .",
    "we have argued that the growth of the bar itself causes stars to become trapped into vertical resonances and so lifted out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "however , simultaneous growth of a bar and boxy / peanut shaped bulge has not yet been observed in three dimensional n - body simulations of non - bending bars .",
    "this could in part be because n - body simulations are are typically thicker than thin bars such as ngc 7582 .",
    "moreover , n - body simulations @xcite have shown that the boxy / peanut continues to grow well after the bar is stable . since resonance capture is likely to be a natural consequence of bar growth , it might be useful to reexamine n - body simulations and verify if orbits are trapped into vertical resonances during the bar growth period . after the bar stabilizes , the analytical framework developed here",
    "might also be applied toward predicting the evolution of stellar orbits caused by secular evolution of a bar .",
    "for example a slow decrease in pattern speed will also trap particles in the vertical resonances and cause them to be lifted into higher orbits . in this case",
    "@xmath84 decreases with time so that phase space moves downwards in figure 1 , causing similar phenomenolgy as growing the bar ; particles trapped into resonances can be lifted higher as the bar evolves .",
    "to put the hamiltonian into action angle variables to first order we use the generating function @xmath132 following this canonical transformation the @xmath19 part of the hamiltonian restricted to @xmath133 @xmath134 becomes @xmath135 to put the hamiltonian into a form that does nt depend on the angle we must do another canonical transformation . note that @xmath136 .",
    "we try the following generating function @xmath137 which leads to new variables @xmath138 such that @xmath139 to fourth order in @xmath30 the hamiltonian becomes @xmath140 which is independent of @xmath29 so that @xmath26 is a conserved quantity and we find that we have successfully transfered the hamiltonian into action angle variables .    via a similar canonical transformation",
    "the term proportional to @xmath141 in equation ( [ hz ] ) disappears but the term proportional to @xmath142 remains yielding the additional term @xmath143 which we have included in eqn .  ( [ hz_can ] ) .",
