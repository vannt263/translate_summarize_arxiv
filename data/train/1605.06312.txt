    "in view of einstein s theory of general relativity , the accelerating expansion of the universe was interpreted as being driven by a tiny positive cosmological constant .",
    "even though this assumption is consistent with observational data , the physical origin of the cosmological constant , its theoretical expectation values which are exceeding the observational limits and its presence , in all stages of the evolution of the universe , leading to an eternally acceleration , seem to favor alternative scenarios to nearly flat universe @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to explain the current cmb anisotropy , supernovae and lss data , and the age of the universe , the spatially open friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) spacetime fueled with different types of matter sources has been seen as a possible candidate @xcite .    since an open frw universe with a sufficiently small curvature can approximate a flat frw background , in the context of recently proposed nonlinear massive gravity , open frw universes driven by arbitrary matter sources have been thoroughly investigated @xcite .",
    "another reason for dealing with negatively curved frw models is related to the origin and evolution of the large - scale magnetic field which has been detected not only in galaxies , galaxy clusters and remote protogalactic structures , but also in empty intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the spatially flat frw cosmological models , where the magnetic field is drastically diluted by the universal expansion , in the case of open universes , the cosmological magnetic field can experience a superadiabatic amplification , irrespective of their matter content and one may assume that this has led to the strong residual magnetic fields which seeded the galactic dynamo @xcite .    as for the matter content , besides the ordinary constituents ( matter , radiation etc ) , an exotic fluid called _ dark energy _ , with a large negative pressure , has been added for explaining the expansion history and growth of structure of the universe @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the cosmological constant is undoubtedly the simplest and the most appealing candidate and the standard @xmath1 ( cosmological constant + cold dark matter ) model has been remarkably successful in describing the real universe , from the matter - dominated phase to the recent accelerated expansion .",
    "nevertheless , this theory is facing small scale controversies coming from recent observations @xcite . in order to solve this tension ,",
    "viable alternative models have been formulated , based on various phenomenological non - constant equations of states ( eos ) , with the parameter around the value @xmath2 @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we deal with the friedmann equation with a cosmological constant and two interacting fluids , as sources of a spatially open @xmath3frw spacetime .",
    "the first fluid is characterized by a dust - type eos ( @xmath4 ) while the second one has a general eos where the dependence on the hubble function is manifest , like in the case of viscous fluids .",
    "the form of the interaction term is not unique and it is usually postulated from different physical arguments or derived as a solution of some dynamical equations describing the required properties of the matter fields @xcite .",
    "the case of the dust coupled with dark energy is particularly interesting , leading to an effective eos and predicting a future evolution of the universe different from the de sitter one .",
    "the non - constant values of @xmath5 are supported by measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , supernovae luminosity distances and baryonic acoustic oscillations .",
    "recently , by analyzing a large sample of cosmological datasets , a clear indication for @xmath6 , at low redshift , has been found @xcite .",

    "the einstein s system of equations , @xmath17 gets the explicit form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble s rate and @xmath20 .    by combining the two equations in ( 5 ) , we get the well - known relation @xmath21 where the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are satisfying the equation of state @xmath24 .",
    "let us assume the existance of two ideal fluids , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with an interaction term between them @xmath27 , described by the relations @xmath28 for the pressureless matter source characterized by @xmath25 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for the other source , so that the continuity equation ( 6 ) is the summation of ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "one of the most common form of the interaction term @xmath27 can be found in @xcite , where the authors are building a model which allows energy inputs and outflows proportional to the densities of the two fluids , in an expanding frw universe with zero spatial curvature .",
    "the total energy being conserved , they have started with the following expression of the exchanged energy , written in terms of the hubble parameter and the two energy densities as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two positive arbitrary dimensionless constants .    in the followings , we are using the relation ( 9 ) and we are postulating an eos of the form @xmath34 where , for the moment , @xmath35 ( expressed in units of @xmath36 ) is assumed to be positive , @xmath5 is a constant that will be determined a bit later and @xmath37 is given by the friedmann s equation @xmath38 simple corrections to the net pressure of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant parameter , have been proposed for the frw universe filled with _ stiff fluid _ and",

    "we notice that , for large @xmath48s , one is only left with a negative matter energy density , which does actually mean exotic matter , so that , the whole universe becomes a giant wormhole .",

    "as the time evolves , the curvature of space starts to dominate the matter density , which is more and more diluted and we are recovering the _ milne model _ of the universe , with @xmath85 .    the equation of state parameter @xmath86 , computed with ( 32 ) and ( 30 ) for @xmath87 , is a function of @xmath83 , decreasing from zero , at @xmath88 , and tending to the negative constant value @xmath89 , \\ ] ] in the far future .",

    "the other particular case with @xmath105 is characterizing an universe with stiff matter and radiation with the total energy density @xmath106 and pressure @xmath107 for negative @xmath35 , the energy density is always positive and the eos parameter @xmath108 is decreasing from the maximum value @xmath109 , for @xmath110 to @xmath111 , in the far future , gaining all the values inbetween .",

    "is generated by imposing the existence of a pressureless matter term in the energy density ( 17 ) , besides the curvature and the cosmological constant contributions .",
    "one may notice that , with the special value of the coupling parameter ( 22 ) , the simplified relation ( 24 ) can be written , in terms of the redshift , as @xmath113 this is of the form @xmath114 , \\ ] ] corresponding to the flat @xmath1 model , with @xmath115 where the index `` 0  is for the present time values . in order to determine the values of the model s parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 , one may use the current fractional density of matter estimated from nine - year wmap observations , @xmath118 , for the present hubble parameter @xmath119 = 0.705 $ ] @xcite .    even though , in the last two decades , the @xmath1 model has been remarkably successful in describing the large - scale structure of the universe ,",
    "the predictions at small scales are controversial and disagree with recent observations @xcite . among the attempts to relieve the tension , we mention the ones which are changing the nature of spacetime to a non - flat background @xcite or the nature of the dark matter , by adding a hot component @xcite or a viscous one @xcite .    nevertheless , for values of @xmath35 which are not fulfilling the condition ( 22 ) , the form of the hubble function is @xmath120 } { [ \\alpha ( \\alpha + \\gamma + 1 ) - \\gamma \\beta \\kappa ] a_0 ^ 2 } ( 1+z)^2 + \\lambda_0 \\nonumber \\\\ *   & = & \\frac{d}{a_0 ^ 3 }",

    "on the other hand , the eos ( 26 ) is similar to the one of a inhomogeneous viscous dark fluid coupled with dark matter in the frw universe , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the bulk viscosity . in the simplest case , @xmath40 is taken as a positive constant , @xmath125 , while in other theories , it is proportional to @xmath121 as @xmath126 , with @xmath127 a positive constant @xcite .",
