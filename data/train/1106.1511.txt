    "astronomical masers are variable phenomenon seen in a high mass star - forming region .",
    "interstellar h@xmath0o masers ( @xmath11 = @xmath12@xmath13 ) at 22.23508@xmath14ghz , which appear at the earliest phase of formation , are highly variable in particular .",
    "they are often excited in strong shocks on a working surface between protostellar outflow and dense envelope ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "outflow properties such as size , velocity and morphology , predicted from interferometric observations of h@xmath0o masers vary source to source ( e.g. , collimated jet @xcite , wide angle flow @xcite , expanding shell @xcite , equatorial flow @xcite or combination of them @xcite ) .",
    "it is possibly related to a number of factors such as stellar mass , evolutional stage , geometry of surrounding envelope and driving mechanism of host outflow .",
    "several single - dish based studies have reported sub - yr scale maser flares in some cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this time - sale is comparable with or even shorter than that of episodic radio jet , which traces a root of protostellar outflow ( e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) , and indicates that some portion of h@xmath0o masers contains valuable information about an innermost outflow .",
    "exact relation between an outflow activity and maser variability is still unclear , but once it is set up , h@xmath0o maser will be an excellent tool to survey dynamic outflow activities in small scale , since its bright emission allows us easy and frequent * monitoring even with * a small size radio telescope .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the new vlbi and single - dish study for intermittent flare activities of h@xmath0o masers in g353.273 + 0.641 ( hereafter g353 ) .",
    "g353 is a strong 22 ghz h@xmath0o maser site in the southern high mass star - forming region ngc6357 @xcite .",
    "the source distance is 1.7 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "multi - epoch atca observation has been reported in @xcite ( hereafter cp08 ) .",
    "class ii ch@xmath15oh maser emission ( @xmath16 = 5@xmath176@xmath18 a@xmath19 ) at 6.668519 ghz is also associated with this source ( cp08 ) , and hence , the host young stellar object ( yso ) is identified as a high mass yso ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cp08 has also suggested that g353 is still in the pre - ultra compact ( uc ) h*ii * region phase , i.e. , high mass protostellar phase , based on the absence of any detectable oh masers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "g353 has been classified as dominant blue - shifted h@xmath0o maser in cp08 .",
    "that is , almost all flux is concentrated on blue - shifted emission , despite of very broad velocity range of @xmath6 100 km s@xmath4 with respect to the systemic velocity of -5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "they have argued that this type of masers can be caused by well - collimated jet aligned close to the line of sight .",
    "there are a few maser sources which show similar blue - shift dominance ( e.g. , @xcite ; cp08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "some of them suggest acceleration of outflowing materials in the jet .",
    "the statistical analysis in @xcite indicates that such a blue - shift dominance is a characteristic of h@xmath0o masers at the earliest evolutionary stage of star - formation .",
    "although the signature of yr - scale variability of the h@xmath0o maser has been pointed out by cp08 , their small dataset is still insufficient for detailed discussion .",
    "our vlbi and single - dish monitoring with vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) and the hokkaido university tomakomai 11-m radio telescope in japan , which has been started from november 2008 , has provided more tight - interval dataset and detected intermittent flare activities accompanied by spatial changes of the shock front traced by maser distribution .",

    "the wide range of velocity within a very compact region readily dismisses the possibility of disc maser which has been proposed in a few cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it also indicates relatively pole - on geometry of the disc - jet system as suggested in cp08 .",
    "expected young age of the driving source may also be related to such a concentrated distribution , however , observed proper motions ( see next section ) comparable to the @xmath7 values still support moderately pole - on geometry even in this case .",
    "we have detected strong maser flare in the second vlbi epoch .",
    "time variation of single - dish spectrum after the flare is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "there are two velocity components which show significant brightening .",

    "the vertical axis indicates peak flux density for single - dish data , and sum of the flux densities of maser spots detected in the peak velocity channel for vlbi data .",
    "downward arrows show 3-@xmath20 upper limit for c70 .",
    "the plotted data correspond to column 5 of table 3 .",
    "only c50 had been flared at first and c70 started to increase its flux about 100 days after observed c50 peak .",
    "sign of second flare is detected only for c50 after the 8th vlbi epoch ( day 841 ) .",
    "the systematic increase of the 3-@xmath20 upper limits in the latter part of c70 is not a signature of second flare , but because of bad weather condition in summer season .",
    "a variation pattern of h@xmath0o maser is , in general , combination of long - term , global pattern and short - term fluctuation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . smoothly varying",
    "light curve indicates that global variation pattern is dominant in c50 rather than random fluctuation during our monitoring .",
    "although large dip was caught in day 473 for c70 , same global pattern was identifiable , i.e. , the flare - up continued for @xmath5 150 days and rapid decaying .",
    "the dip in c70 is roughly factor of three weaker than the peak flux density and explainable by short - term fluctuation .",
    "figure 4 presents time variation of the prominent part of the maser alignment that contains most flux of c50 .",
    "this successive alignment had been appeared after the first flare .",
    "the maximum spatial scale of the alignment is roughly 50 mas ( @xmath5 90 au ) that is almost typical value for an individual maser filament in an outflow shock ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a number written in upper right part of each panel shows relative day from the 1st vlbi epoch ( day 183 ) .",
    "the alignment was initially vertical and dramatically changed to be horizontal during the flare phase ( 2nd  4th epoch ) .",
    "all maser features in this region completely disappeared in the 7th vlbi epoch .",
    "another maser alignment appeared in the final vlbi epoch , tracing the second flare .",
    "because of non - negligible accelerations of @xmath7 , the identification of individual maser feature in these alignments is difficult ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "we , thus , estimated averaged proper motions of these alignment , where we averaged the positions of all maser spots in each alignment and calculated @xmath38 and @xmath39 for vertical and horizontal alignments , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 show the linear proper motion in each directions .",
    "such a motion perpendicular to a maser alignment should trace bulk motion of shock front , if we consider the standard model that h@xmath0o masers are excited in a thin sheet of dense gas compressed by outflow shock @xcite .",
    "estimated @xmath38 and @xmath39 are 7.8 mas yr@xmath4 from east to west and 7.6 mas yr@xmath4 from north to south , respectively .",

    "<S> we have performed vlbi and single - dish monitoring of 22 ghz h@xmath0o maser emission from the high mass young stellar object g353.273 + 0.641 with vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) and tomakamai 11-m radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> two maser flares have been detected , separated almost two years . </S>",
    "<S> frequent vlbi monitoring has revealed that these flare activities have been accompanied by structural change of the prominent shock front traced by h@xmath0o maser alignments . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected only blue - shifted emissions and all maser features have been distributed within very small area of 200 @xmath1 200 au@xmath2 in spite of wide velocity range ( @xmath3 100 km s@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light curve shows notably intermittent variation and suggests that the h@xmath0o masers in g353.273 + 0.641 are excited by episodic radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scale of @xmath5 2 yr and characteristic velocity of @xmath5 500 km s@xmath4 also support this interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> two isolated velocity components of c50 ( -53 @xmath6 7 km s@xmath4 ) and c70 ( -73 @xmath6 7 km s@xmath4 ) have shown synchronised linear acceleration of the flux weighted @xmath7 values ( @xmath5 -5 </S>",

    "<S> this can be converted to the lower - limit momentum rate of 1.1 @xmath1 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 km s@xmath4 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> maser properties are quite similar to that of @xmath10 20126 + 4104 especially . </S>",
    "<S> this corroborates the previous suggestion that g353.273 + 0.641 is a candidate of high mass protostellar object . </S>",
    "<S> the possible pole - on geometry of disc - jet system can be suitable for direct imaging of the accretion disc in this case .    [ firstpage ]    ism : jets and outflows  masers  stars : early - type  stars : formation . </S>"
