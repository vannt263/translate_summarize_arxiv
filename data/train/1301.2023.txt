    "topological insulators ( tis ) belong to a new class of quantum matters , where unique gapless surface states with linear energy - momentum dispersion characteristics ( i.e. , dirac fermion states ) coexist with gapped bulk states .",
    "@xcite as a consequence of the inherit strong spin - orbit coupling , the spin orientations of the helical surface states are transversely locked to their translational crystal momenta . in the absence of any magnetic scattering , the time - reversal coherent backscattering",
    "would thus be suppressed , leading to the well - known weak antilocalization ( wal ) effect which manifests positive magnetoresistances ( mrs ) in low perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite    although an observation of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) wal effect can be a signature of the existence of ti surface states , the strong spin - orbit coupling in the bulk conduction channel can also contribute to a wal effect .",
    "this situation often happens in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis , such as the p - type bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and the n - type bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , owing to the high levels of unintentional doping which readily occurs during the sample growth as well as the device fabrication processes .",
    "therefore , the mr data of 3d tis have often been analyzed in terms of a multichannel - conduction model which considers the potential contributions from both the surface and the bulk states .",
    "@xcite due to the small surface - to - volume ratios in real samples , a clear - cut separation of the possible surface contribution from the overall carrier transport has remained nontrivial .",
    "even if a surface contribution were separated , it still poses a very difficult task to associate the contribution with either the top or the bottom surface states , or both . to reach",
    "a consensus on this issue will definitely require more experiments employing specifically designed samples ( e.g. , with both top and bottom gates ) and with improved material qualities .",
    "equally important , a good theoretical understanding of the various issues , such as the coupling mechanisms ( e .. g , inelastic electron relaxation ) between the surface and the bulk states , the electron / hole dephasing processes , the coulomb interaction effect in the limit of strong spin - orbit scattering , and the band bending effect in individual ti materials , is urgently called for before a quantitative analysis and definitive conclusion about the coherent surface transport could be unambiguously drawn .    in this work",

    "we have found the positive mrs in the wal effect in small perpendicular magnetic fields @xmath7 .",
    "our results indicate an emergence of two coherent conduction channels as either the temperature is reduced to below 1 k or v@xmath8 is increased to be higher than a few tens of volts .",

    "these observations are discussed in terms of the possible ( partial ) decoupling of the surface states from the bulk states .",
    "moreover , we have observed the 2d electron - electron interaction ( eei ) effect in the weakly disordered regime , which caused a logarithmic temperature dependent resistance rise at low temperatures .",

    "@xcite since the @xmath55/@xmath89 carriers in the bulk channel are ( partly ) depleted away under a large positive / negative @xmath2 , a decoupling of the two channels thus could possibly take place .",
    "this in turn is reflected by the increase in the @xmath29@xmath9 value by a factor of @xmath4 2 .",
    "because our extracted @xmath68 value is always smaller than unity , we have presumed that there exists only one conductive surface channel in bt-24 .",
    "this presumption is in accord with a recent report by takagaki _",
    "@xcite who have pointed out that the seemingly absence of the wal effect for one of the surfaces was a common finding in a number of studies of 3d tis .",
    "@xcite in our case , the top surface layer might have been deteriorated owing to its constant exposure to the air atmosphere as well as its undergoing the device fabrication process . furthermore , our bt-24 is 65 nm thick and highly doped , and hence the top surface state , if any exists , would be too far away to be tuned by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we tentatively ascribe the observed conductive surface states to be associated with the bottom surface of the microflake . it is also important to note that we have ascribed the additional coherent transport channel to the ti bottom states , rather than to an electron accumulation layer . to rule out the latter scenario , we have measured the low-@xmath22 resistance as a function of backgate voltage in a bt-23 microflake which possessed very similar electronic properties to those of the bt-24 microflake .",
    "our measured resistance curve @xmath91 at every temperature always revealed a maximum at a characteristic backgate voltage @xmath92 , which signified that the fermi energy was indeed shifted to become aligned with the dirac point at this particular backgate voltage ( see further discussion in the supplemental material @xcite ) .",
    "( color online ) bt-24 microflake at @xmath22 = 0.3 k. ( a ) mr data measured in perpendicular _ b _ field and under several _",

    "the solid curves are least - squares fits to eq .",

    "note that resistance fluctuations are visible .",
    "( b ) variation of the extracted parameter @xmath68 and electron dephasing length _ _ l__@xmath69 with @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed curves are guides to the eye . ]    finally , the reason for the marked effect of @xmath2 on @xmath67 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_4](b ) ] is theoretically less clear . under a large positive @xmath2 ,",
    "the carriers are slightly depleted away from the bottom surface .",
    "the depletion would certainly lead to deteriorated coulomb screening between the carriers , leading to an enhanced electron - electron ( hole - hole ) scattering rate and thus a shortened @xmath67 .",
    "however , as mentioned , the hole concentration is reduced only by 2% under a @xmath2 = @xmath3560 v in this bt-24 device .",
    "it is thus conjectured whether such a small reduction in @xmath55 could have already caused a notable change in @xmath67",
    ". there could be other explanations , for example , based on a change in the degree of coupling between bulk and surface states , which would take place in the presence of large backgate voltages . a quantitative account for the suppression of @xmath67 by @xmath2 must await further theoretical investigations .",
    "we have measured the resistances and magnetoresistances of two bi@xmath0te@xmath1 microflakes at low temperatures and under applied backgate voltages .",
    "low - temperature resistance corrections due to the 2d eei effect in the presence of weak disorder are observed .",
    "the extracted coulomb screening parameter @xmath31 is negative , which is in line with the situation of strong spin - orbit scattering as is inherited in the ti materials .",
    "positive mr dips in small perpendicular magnetic fields are measured , which can be satisfactorily described by the existing 2d wal theory by taking into account a multichannel - conduction model in a ti material .",
    "our extracted @xmath93 values , which increase by a factor of @xmath4 2 from @xmath4 0.35 to @xmath4 0.7 , suggest the emergence of two coherent conduction channels as either the temperature decreases to subkelvin temperatures or the backgate voltage increases to several tens of volts .",
    "this doubling of the conduction channels seems to signify the ( partial ) decoupling of the surface and the bulk states . in short ,",
    "our overall results provide qualitative , but not yet quantitative , evidence for the likely existence of dirac fermion states in the 3d bi@xmath5te@xmath6 material . to achieve a clear - cut separation of the contributions from the individual surface and bulk states",
    "undoubtedly would require further theoretical formulations and experimental measurements .",
    "the authors thank zhao - guo li , tai - shi chen and feng - qi song for providing us with the samples used in this study and for their reading through an early version of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the taiwan national science council through grant no .",
    "nsc 100 - 2120-m-009 - 008 and the moe atu program .                                            in the formal eei theory ,",
    "the screening parameter @xmath31 should be replaced by the parameter @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath45 equals @xmath31 to within @xmath4 10% for @xmath95 .",
    "it is thus not critical to distinguish between @xmath45 and @xmath31 in most experiments .",
    "see , for example , ref . .",
    "a possible alternative explanation is that an increase in @xmath34 larger than the theoretical prediction , i.e. , @xmath96 , might imply that both the bulk and surface states contribute to the measured 2d eei effect , see ref . .",
    "yet another explanation for negative @xmath31 values is as follows . in ref . , wu _",
    "_ had reported that , under the circumstance of ( intermediately ) strong electron - phonon coupling ( such as that in a bcs superconductor ) , @xmath31 can take negative values .",
    "this early experimental observation might be in line with the recent theoretical finding reported in ref . , where giraud and egger have showed that the phonon - mediated effective interaction among dirac surface fermions can be attractive at low frequencies , which would then possibly allow for superconducting correlations .",
    "this issue deserves further theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "the @xmath55 value determined this way is a few times smaller than that inferred from the hall measurement on the bt-15 device .",
    "this difference is not critical for the present discussion and does not affect the conclusion drawn in this work .",
    "s. p. chiu and j. j. lin , unpublished . in the case of one and only one coherent conduction cahnnel as well as in the limit of strong spin - orbit scattering ( i.e. , @xmath9 = @xmath291/2 )",
    ", the 2d wal mr in parallel @xmath7 fields is given by : @xmath97 ^ 2 = ( e^2/4 \\pi^2 \\hbar ) \\ , { \\rm ln}[1 + ( e b^2 t^2 ) / ( 12 \\hbar b_\\varphi)]$ ] .",
    "in ref . , the authors had studied a 50-nm thick be@xmath5te@xmath6 film at @xmath22 = 2 k. they ascribed their measured mr dip in parallel @xmath7 fields to the 3d wal effect but extracted a comparatively large value of @xmath67 = 331 nm .",
    "then , their bulk channel must be 2d , instead of 3d , with regard to the wal effect .        in practice ,",
    "the electron dephasing lengths of the surface and the bulk channels can not be unambiguously distinguished . nevertheless , according to the current understanding ( see ref . ) , the two length scales [ @xmath98 and @xmath99 differ by no more than a factor of @xmath40 2 .",
    "this in turn could cause an error bar of @xmath88 40% in the difference , if any exists , between the effective @xmath67 and the surface @xmath98 values .",
    "an alternative scenario which invoked a surface - bulk scattering process in low - carrier - density tis was proposed in ref . .",
