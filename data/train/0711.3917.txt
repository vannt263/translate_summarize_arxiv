    "understanding the behavior of qcd matter under different conditions of temperature and density is the subject of intense experimental and theoretical work in nuclear physics .",
    "the transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma at high temperature is expected to be achieved in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the hadronization of partons in vacuum or cold nuclear matter ( i.e. in a nucleus ) is also of keen interest , and represents a nonperturbative and dynamic qcd process .",
    "the formation and interaction of heavy quarkonia ( for example @xmath0 mesons ) in vacuum , cold nuclear matter and hot nuclear matter present an excellent laboratory for gaining insights on these transformations .",
    "recent results from the relativistic heavy ion collider reveal a significant suppression of the final @xmath0 yield in central ( small impact parameter ) @xmath7 reactions at @xmath1=200 gev , relative to expectations scaled from @xmath8 reactions at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "a possible source of this suppression is the screening of the attractive interaction between the quark - antiquark pair in the hot nuclear medium , as temperatures are expected to be above the critical temperature for a quark - gluon plasma transition .",
    "larger @xmath0 suppression is observed at forward rapidity than at midrapidity , which contradicts models with only color screening of quarkonia proportional to the local energy density .",
    "produced @xmath9 pairs must pass through the remaining nuclear material from the incident cold nuclei , in addition to surviving any hot medium environment .",
    "the so - called cold nuclear matter effects  @xcite , including modification of initial parton distribution functions ( shadowing , gluon saturation , anti - shadowing , emc effect , etc . ) , initial and final state partonic multiple scattering , and related initial state parton energy loss need to be accounted for before firm conclusions can be drawn about the effect of the hot medium thought to be created .",
    "in fact , these various cold nuclear matter effects are interesting in their own right , notably in terms of hadronization time scales , parton energy loss in matter , and the various initial state effects mentioned above .",
    "this paper presents a new analysis of the modification of @xmath0 production in deuteron - gold ( @xmath10 ) collisions relative to proton - proton ( @xmath8 ) collisions at @xmath1=200 gev and the implications for understanding the @xmath7 and @xmath11 data at the same energy .",
    "the phenix experiment has previously published a result using @xmath8 and @xmath10 data taken in 2003  @xcite .",
    "a modest @xmath0 suppression was observed at forward rapidity ( i.e. in the deuteron moving direction ) , which is a possible indication of shadowing of low-@xmath3 gluons in the gold nucleus . a substantially larger ( more than an order of magnitude ) @xmath8 data set was recorded in 2005 with the @xmath0 results published in  @xcite , and has been used as the baseline for recent @xmath7 and @xmath11 nuclear modification factors  @xcite .",
    "the same @xmath8 data set is used in the analysis presented here to determine the @xmath10 nuclear modifications more accurately and in a fully consistent way with those in the @xmath7 and @xmath11 cases .",
    "in addition , during the two years between the analyses of the 2003 and 2005 data sets significant improvements in the reconstruction software and signal extraction method were achieved , as well as an overall better understanding of the detector performance .",
    "these improvements have been included in this analysis , allowing maximal cancellation of systematic errors when using the 2005 @xmath8 data sample to form the @xmath0 nuclear modification factor .",
    "we first describe the updated analysis , then present the new nuclear modification factors and their implications .",
    "the phenix apparatus is described in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two sets of spectrometers referred to as the central arms , which measure particles emitted at midrapidity ( @xmath12 ) , and the muon arms , measuring particles emitted at backward and forward rapidity ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .    at midrapidity ,",
    "@xmath0 particles are measured via their decay into two electrons .",
    "electrons are identified by matching tracks reconstructed with drift chambers ( dc ) and pad chambers ( pc ) to clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) and hits in the ring imaging cerenkov counters ( rich ) . in @xmath10 collisions ,",
    "a charged track is identified as an electron candidate by requiring at least three matching rich phototube hits within a certain radius with respect to the the center defined by the track projection at the rich , a position matching of @xmath15  standard deviations between the emcal cluster and the reconstructed track , and a cut on the ratio of energy to momentum . in @xmath8 collisions",
    "the electron identification cuts are the same except that only two matching rich phototube hits are required .    at forward and backward rapidity",
    ", @xmath0 particles are measured via their decay into two muons .",
    "muons are identified by matching tracks measured in cathode strip chambers ( referred to as the muon tracker , or mutr ) to hits in alternating planes of iarocci tubes and steel absorbers ( referred to as the muon identifier , or muid ) .",
    "each muon arm is located behind a thick copper and iron absorber that is meant to absorb most hadrons produced during the collisions , so that the measured muons must penetrate 8 to 11 interaction lengths of material in total .",
    "the @xmath10 data used for this analysis were recorded in 2003 using a minimum bias trigger that required hits in each of the two beam - beam counters ( bbc ) located at positive and negative rapidity ( @xmath16 ) , and represent integrated luminosities for the different spectrometers ranging from 1.4 nb@xmath17 to 1.7 nb@xmath17 ( or equivalently 2.7 to 3.4 billion interactions ) .",
    "this trigger covers @xmath18% of the total @xmath10 inelastic cross section of 2260 mb  @xcite . for the electrons ,",
    "an additional trigger was used that required one hit above threshold in the emcal and a matching hit in the rich . for the muons ,",
    "two additional triggers were used at different times during the data - taking period .",
    "the muon triggers are based on information from the muid , which has five active detector layers between the steel absorbers .",
    "for the first part of the data - taking period , one of the tracks was required to reach the fourth muid plane , while the other was only required to reach the second muid plane . for the latter part ,",
    "the trigger required at least two tracks to reach the fourth muid plane of iarocci tubes .",
    "the bbcs are also used to determine the centrality of the @xmath10 collisions by measuring the energy deposited in the counters located at negative rapidity ( in the gold - going direction ) . for a given centrality bin ,",
    "the average number of equivalent nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath19 ) is derived from this energy using a glauber calculation  @xcite coupled to a simulation of the bbc .",
    "the centrality bins used in this analysis and the corresponding number of collisions are listed in table  [ table : centrality ] . to ensure that the centrality categories are well defined , collisions are required to be within @xmath20 cm of the center of the interaction region .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the modified nuclear pdfs from eks and ndsg are constrained from other experimental measurements such as deep inelastic scattering from various nuclear targets and the resulting @xmath21 structure functions .",
    "a geometric parametrization of these pdfs based on the path of the parton through the nucleus is described in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "one can test this geometric dependence by comparison with the @xmath10 nuclear modification factors as a function of @xmath19 . using this geometric dependence ,",
    "the most probable @xmath22 is calculated independently in three rapidity ranges ( see table  [ tab : sigma_breakup ] )",
    ". the corresponding nuclear modification values and their one standard deviation bands are shown as a function of @xmath19 in figure  [ fig : model_comparisons_dau_ncoll ] . the two calculations with eks and ndsg nuclear pdfs yield almost identical bands since the same geometric dependence is used in both cases .",
    "however , each band represents a different balance of modification due to the nuclear pdf and the breakup cross section .    for both the eks and the ndsg pdfs ,",
    "the values of @xmath22 extracted from the overall rapidity dependence of @xmath2 and from the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath2 within the different rapidity ranges are consistent within the large systematic uncertainties . it should be noted that though the @xmath23p - value for the best fit is poor at backward rapidity ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_comparisons_dau_ncoll ] ) , there is still a well defined maximum in the likelihood function for @xmath22 . a future higher precision @xmath2 measurement as a function of centrality will be crucial to constrain the exact geometric dependence .",
    "one can also utilize this model to do a consistent calculation of the contribution from cold nuclear matter effects that should be present in @xmath11 and @xmath7 collisions .",
    "these contributions , using the best fit value of @xmath22 and their one standard deviation values extracted from the data in figure  [ fig : model_comparisons_dau ] for each of the two shadowing models , are shown in figures  [ fig : model_comparisons_cucu ] and  [ fig : model_comparisons_auau ] . in the @xmath11 case ,",
    "@xmath0 production is not suppressed beyond cold nuclear matter effects at midrapidity or at forward rapidity , within the limits of the large error bands , and the midrapidity data in the @xmath7 case is similarly inconclusive .",
    "however , there is a significant suppression in the data at forward rapidity , beyond the uncertainties in both the data and the projection .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty band at forward and midrapidities are entirely correlated , as they reflect only the uncertainty in the @xmath22 .",
    "there is no systematic uncertainty included for the choice of modified nuclear pdf model , which is the only way to change the relative suppression between forward and midrapidities within the context of this calculation .",
    "the more data - driven calculation described later in this section , however , is performed independently at different rapidities and does not suffer the same stipulation .",
    "it should also be noted that the theoretical calculations yield @xmath24 as a continuous function of the number of participants , whereas the data points are at discrete values representing a convolution of the modification factor with the @xmath25 distribution within a particular centrality category . a glauber simulation combined with a monte carlo of the phenix experimental trigger and centrality selection is utilized to convert the continuous theory predictions into discrete predictions in the simulated phenix centrality categories .",
    "thus , the results shown in the figures are in fact predictions for the matched event selection categories of the experimental data points .    in order to explore the cold nuclear matter constraints further , an alternative data - driven method proposed in  @xcite",
    "this approach assumes that there is a single modification factor parameterizing all cold nuclear matter effects that is a simple function of the radial position in the nucleus .",
    "this computation has the advantage of not having to assume a specific shadowing scheme and a specific breakup cross section , but instead relies only on the measured impact parameter dependence .",
    "it assumes that the cold nuclear matter effects suffered by a @xmath0 in a @xmath7 collision at a given rapidity are the product of the modifications measured in @xmath10 collisions at the same rapidity and the modifications measured at the opposite rapidity ( or equivalently in a @xmath26 collision ) .",
    "this assumption holds for the two effects considered so far , namely shadowing and subsequent breakup .",
    "it also assumes that the same parton distributions are sampled by the @xmath0 particles observed in the ( wide ) rapidity range in @xmath7 and @xmath10 collisions .",
    "note that since this model implicitly includes any possible modified nuclear pdfs , the modification factors may have an @xmath3-dependence that is accounted for by considering the backward , mid and forward rapidity @xmath10 data .",
    "the different rapidity regions are sensitive to the initial - state partons in the gold nucleus in three broad ranges of @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath27 0.002 - 0.01 , 0.01 - 0.05 , and 0.05 - 0.2 , as determined from pythia .",
    "a glauber monte carlo and a simulation of the bbc detector used for centrality determination and triggering are done . the resulting four centrality categories ( 0 - 20% , 20 - 40%",
    ", 40 - 60% , 60 - 88% ) in @xmath10 collisions are characterized by a distribution in the number of binary collisions , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : nagle_glauber ] .",
    "in addition , the distribution of radial positions @xmath28 in the @xmath29 nucleus of binary collisions is calculated and shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nagle_glauber ] .",
    "the procedure is to use the forward , mid , and backward rapidity centrality - dependent @xmath2 to constrain the modification factor @xmath30 for three broad regions of initial parton @xmath3 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively ) .",
    "then one can use these parameterizations to project the cold nuclear matter effect in the @xmath7 case .",
    "the current @xmath10 data are insufficient to constrain the functional form of @xmath30 . as a simplifying case",
    ", @xmath30 is assumed to be linear in @xmath28 and to be fixed at @xmath34 at the edge of the gold nucleus .",
    "thus , the only free parameter is the slope ( or equivalently the magnitude of the modification factor at @xmath35 ) .",
    "other functions were tried and essentially differ by their extrapolation to lower and higher radial positions , since the data are not precise enough to constrain the shape .",
    "this has a particularly strong impact on the most peripheral collisions for which our assumption that @xmath36 adds a significant constraint to the shape .    for all possible slope parameters , consistency with the experimental data is checked using the procedure detailed in  @xcite , which utilizes the full statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the range of parameters within one standard deviation of the uncertainties is determined separately for backward , mid , and forward rapidity . using this range of parameters , the cold nuclear matter suppression expected in @xmath7 collisions",
    "is projected as a function of collision centrality and for mid and forward rapidity .",
    "note that the forward rapidity @xmath7 @xmath0 production is sensitive to the low-@xmath3 partons in one gold nucleus and the high-@xmath3 partons in the other gold nucleus .",
    "thus , in the monte carlo , for every binary collision at @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( the radii with respect to the center of each nucleus ) the expected modification is @xmath39 .",
    "the midrapidity @xmath7 @xmath0 production is predominantly sensitive to the mid-@xmath3 partons from both gold nuclei and therefore the expected modification is @xmath40 .",
    "the total modification expected is calculated by taking the average over all correlated @xmath41 and @xmath42 positions for binary collisions within overall @xmath7 collisions in each @xmath7 centrality class .",
    "the results of these calculations matched to the experimentally measured @xmath7 centrality bins are shown in figure  [ fig : nagle ] .",
    "it is notable that the midrapidity cold nuclear matter extrapolation agrees within the uncertainty of the experimental data at midrapidity .",
    "thus , it is not possible within the current constraints to determine the potential extent of hot nuclear matter effects .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively similar to that reached from the previous model calculations as shown in figure  [ fig : model_comparisons_auau ] .",
    "however , at forward rapidity , this method projects a somewhat larger range of possible cold nuclear matter effects than the previous models .    neither the predictions of cold nuclear matter effects in heavy ion collisions based on fitting of the @xmath10 data with theoretical curves ( figures  [ fig : model_comparisons_cucu ] and  [ fig : model_comparisons_auau ] ) , nor those obtained directly from the @xmath10 data points ( figure  [ fig : nagle ] ) are well enough constrained to permit quantitative conclusions about additional hot nuclear matter effects .",
    "results from a glauber model monte carlo including simulation of the @xmath10 centrality selection and triggering based on the phenix bbc .",
    "the top panel shows the distribution of the number of binary collisions for events in each of the four centrality classes 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , 40 - 60% , 60 - 88% .",
    "the distribution for radial impact points in the gold nucleus of binary collisions is shown in the lower panel . ]",

    "cuts and analysis techniques that are consistent with the previously published results for @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 collisions at the same energy  @xcite are used .",
    "the new analysis also benefits from the significantly larger p+p  data set from run-5 .",
    "a statistical comparison of these new results to theoretical calculations has been performed with a detailed handling of the experimental uncertainties to estimate a @xmath0 ( or precursor ) breakup cross section in cold nuclear matter on top of models for the modifications of the parton distribution functions in the nucleus .",
    "using eks ( ndsg ) shadowing , a breakup cross section of @xmath44 ( @xmath5 ) mb is obtained .",
    "these breakup cross - section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the @xmath6 mb determined at lower energies at the cern - sps  @xcite .",
    "the measured values are then used to predict the expected cold nuclear matter effects on @xmath0 production in @xmath11 and @xmath7 collisions , and these are compared to the measured nuclear modification factors for those systems .",
    "these predictions are found to be similar to those from a less model - dependent and more data - driven method based on the variation of the nuclear modification factor measured in @xmath10 collisions as a function of both rapidity and centrality  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the latter method yields a somewhat larger possible suppression in the forward rapidity case . in all cases the large error bars associated with",
    "the extrapolation prevent making firm quantitative statements on any additional @xmath0 suppression in @xmath7 collisions beyond that expected from cold nuclear matter effects . a @xmath10 data set with much improved statistical precision is needed to both reduce the statistical uncertainties and permit better control over the systematic uncertainties .",
