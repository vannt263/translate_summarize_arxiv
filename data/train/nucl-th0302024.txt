    "reliable estimates of the production and scattering cross sections of open and/or hidden charmed hadrons in hadronic matter are important for understanding many phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions and hadron - nucleus reactions . in particular , the dissociation cross sections of @xmath1 by light meson or nucleon are directly related to the role of hadronic suppression of @xmath1 production in heavy ion collisions @xcite , and have thus been a subject under active investigations . in the heavy charm",
    "quark mass limit , a formula based on the leading - order ( lo ) perturbative qcd was derived in refs .",
    "@xcite for the absorption cross sections of @xmath1 by hadrons .",
    "higher - order corrections due to the target mass and relativistic effects have also been estimated @xcite . however , the perturbative qcd approach is useful only at very high energy when nontrivial higher twist and higher @xmath2 corrections are small . at low energies ,",
    "these corrections become large , so nonperturbative approaches are needed .",
    "various phenomenological models have thus been introduced for studying the @xmath1 absorption cross section by hadrons at low energies .",
    "these include the hadronic model based on effective lagrangians @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , and the quark - exchange model @xcite .",
    "results from these phenomenological models all give much larger cross sections for @xmath1 absorption by light mesons than that given by the perturbative qcd formula . to test the prediction from the hadronic model ,",
    "the same effective lagrangian has been used to evaluate the absorption cross section of @xmath1 by nucleon , and it is found to be consistent with that extracted from photonuclear production of @xmath1 @xcite .    in the present paper , we generalize the effective hadronic lagrangian , which has also been used to study charmed meson scattering by hadrons @xcite and charmed meson production from meson - nucleon scattering @xcite , to include the photon and to study charmed hadron production from photo - nucleon reaction near threshold .",
    "both two - body ( @xmath3 ) and three - body ( @xmath4 ) final states are included .",
    "we find that using reasonable values for the cutoff parameters at the interaction vertices , the resulting charmed hadron production cross section near threshold energy is consistent with the measured one at center - of - mass energy of 6 gev @xcite , although at high energies its value is much smaller than that measured experimentally or given by the lo perturbative qcd .",
    "we further find that the relative contribution of two - body to three - body final states is also consistent with the experimental data .",
    "our results thus provide another independent test and confirmation of the validity of hadronic model for determining the cross sections involving heavy flavors at low energies .",
    "the effective hadronic lagrangian used in the present study will also be useful for evaluating other low energy cross sections involving heavy flavored hadrons , which can be studied at both the japanese hadron facility @xcite and at the gsi future accelerator @xcite , where open and hidden charmed hadrons are copiously produced in proton- and antiproton - nucleus reactions near threshold .",

    "in summary , the total cross section for charmed hadron production in photo - nucleon reaction is evaluated in an effective hadronic model .",
    "this model is based on a gauged su(4 ) flavor symmetric lagrangian with the photon introduced as a @xmath131 gauged particle .",
    "the symmetry breaking effect is taken into account via using empirical hadron masses and coupling constants .",
    "form factors of the monopole type are introduced at interaction vertices .",
    "this hadronic model has been previously used to evaluate the dissociation cross section of @xmath1 by hadrons . for photo production of charmed hadrons on nucleon",
    ", we have included both two - body final states involving a @xmath0 and a charmed meson as well as three - body final states involving a nucleon and a charmed and anticharmed meson pair .",
    "it is found that reactions with two - body final states dominate the production cross section at low center - of - mass energies while reactions with three - body states are more important at high center - of - mass energies . using cut - off parameters in the form factors from previous studies of @xmath1 absorption by hadrons ,",
    "the model reproduces the lowest available experimental data at center - of - mass energy of 6 gev .",
    "our results thus again confirm the validity of the effective hadron model in previous studies and provide a useful model for further studies of reactions involving heavy quarks at low and near threshold energies .",
