    "rapid x - ray variabilities which lead to dramatic drops in the x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath1 4 @xmath0 12 in a couple of seconds and periodic repetition of such luminosity variations observed over a long time - scale , make grs 1915 + 105 atypical with respect to other micro - quasars .",
    "based on light curves and color - color diagram , the observed variabilities have been categorized into 14 different classes ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 ; @xcite ) and broadly into three basic x - ray states @xmath0 ( 1 ) a low luminosity disk dominated state ( state a ) , ( 2 ) high luminosity , thermal and/or non - thermal emission dominated state ( state b ) and ( 3 ) low luminosity powerlaw dominated hard state ( state c ) .",
    "rapid x - ray variabilities observed during @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 classes are thought to be due to rapid transitions among these three basic x - ray states @xcite .",
    "however , dissection of these classes into three basic states in @xcite reveals following details : ( 1 ) among three basic states , state c is the most stable state as it has been observed for the longest time - scale in each of these classes .",
    "state c in @xcite is described as a low count rate state ( usually brighter than state a ) where inner disk temperature is either very low ( @xmath1 0.5 kev ) or there is no disk contribution .",
    "white noise variabilities observed on time scale of 1 sec .",
    "( 2 ) variations in occurrence time - scale of the c state is largest among three states .",
    "for example , during @xmath8 class , state c is observed for as short as @xmath160 sec while during @xmath3 class , it is observed for as long as @xmath1500 sec .",
    "however , it can last for few days in a non - variable class like @xmath12 .",
    "( 3 ) more importantly , variation in the luminosity of the state c is largest among three states .",
    "for example , with _ rxte_/pca in the 2.0@xmath060.0 kev energy band , state c is observed sometimes at 2.2 @xmath15 10@xmath16 ergs / s during @xmath8 class while during @xmath4 class it is sometimes observed at 11.3 @xmath15 10@xmath16 ergs / s .",
    "because of large variation in the time - scale as well as luminosity within state c , it is important to know whether all c state observations in different classes have same timing and spectral characteristics or not .",
    "if they are same , then what drives such large variations in the luminosity and time - scale within a same state ?",
    "however , no detailed analysis have been carried out to resolve these issues .",
    "significant efforts have been made to understand the origin and the nature of state c ( here , we call it hard x - ray dip ) in different time scales in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "@xcite show that hard x - ray dip spectra during @xmath6 and @xmath2 class can be fitted with the diskbb+nthcomp model .",
    "@xcite show that both burst and hard x - ray dip spectra of @xmath7 class can be fitted using comptt+powerlaw model .",
    "@xmath4 class spectra can be modelled using the combination of diskbb+powerlaw+comptt where observed soft dips ( following the hard dips ) may be due to ejections of comptonization cloud @xcite . in @xmath3 , @xmath9/@xmath8 , and @xmath17 classes",
    ", @xcite showed that the soft a - dips follow the longer hard c - dips which probably reflects the ejection of coronal material . using phase",
    "resolved spectroscopy , @xcite show that heartbeat oscillations ( @xmath6 class ) are results of a combination of a thermal - viscous radiation pressure instability and a local eddington limit where hard x - ray dips are resulting from the sudden radiation pressure driven evaporation .",
    "however , in a separate work , @xcite show that a combination of hybrid corona and disk blackbody model can describe energy spectra of all phases in @xmath6 class including hard x - ray dips .",
    "hence along - with large variations in the flux and time - scale in hard x - ray dips in different classes , there exists large degeneracy in spectral analysis & modelling of limit cycle oscillations .",
    "one key indication from these studies is that variability properties and spectral nature of hard x - ray dips during abrupt transitions may vary from that of the hard x - ray dips during smooth transitions .",
    "this motivate us to perform detailed spectral and timing analysis of hard x - ray dips in different flux scale and time scale .",
    "the second motivation comes from another transient , galactic black hole x - ray binary ( bhxb ) igr j17091 - 3624 as it shows regular , repetitive , large amplitude oscillations in their x - ray light curve , very similar to @xmath6 cycles observed from grs 1915 + 105 @xcite . using x - ray morphology and hardness , a few more variabilities",
    "are observed from igr j17091 - 3624 @xcite , some of which are similar to those from grs 1915 + 105 and show hard x - ray dips .",
    "time - scale and flux level of these dips are much lower than any such dip observed in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "these findings greatly increase the importance of understanding the origin and nature of hard x - ray dips in these two bhxbs .    in this work ,",
    "we summarize a comprehensive study on spectral modelling and timing properties ( like rms spectra , lag spectra , variabilities at different time - scales ) of hard x - ray dips , frequently observed in the light curve of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 classes in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091 - 3624 .",
    "we establish a global relationship between hard dip time and the cycle time in different classes of grs 1915 + 105 as well as igr j17091 - 3624 .",
    "we show that hard dips in classes with abrupt transitions and relatively short dip time intervals ( like @xmath8 , @xmath9 classes ) show hard - lag , while hard dips in classes with smooth evolutions and relatively long dip time intervals ( like @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 classes ) show soft - lag .",
    "even lag spectra of hard dips in @xmath8 , @xmath9 classes are different from those in @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 classes .",
    "although hard x - ray dips of different classes may belong to the same spectral state , i.e. , state c , we detect a large variation in different spectral parameters like disk temperature , disk radius etc .",
    "a high - energy break is significantly required in the energy spectra of all high luminosity ( @xmath18 4 @xmath15 10@xmath16 ergs / s ) x - ray dips of @xmath4 and @xmath3 classes while low energy break / no break is required in low luminosity ( @xmath19 4 @xmath15 10@xmath16 ergs / s ) x - ray dips of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 classes .",
    "we show that variability properties of hard x - ray dips observed in another bhxb igr j17091 - 3624 during its 2011 outburst are consistent with those of abrupt transitions rather than smooth evolutions in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we discuss our timing and spectral analysis procedure and results in section 2 and its subsections .",
    "discussions and conclusions are provided in section 3 and its subsection .",
    "we analyse all _ rxte_/pca observations of grs 1915 + 105 between 1996 and 1998 and found 31 observations which show either of @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 classes with sufficiently large number of complete x - ray dips ( total dip time in each observation @xmath18 500 sec ) .",
    "we assume that results obtained from these 31 observations are valid for all similar observations in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we exclude @xmath6 class from our analysis because hard dip intervals in this class are less than 25 sec as they are associated with high frequency oscillations and spectral parameters vary rapidly within this period . for grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "the full energy - channel information are only available for standard2 data which has 16 sec time resolution .",
    "hence energy spectral analysis and energy - dependent lag spectral analysis are not possible with these class dips .",
    "although long , hard dip intervals have been observed several times in @xmath17 class , within 2 years of observational data considered in our work ( including observations mentioned in @xcite ) , we find only one observation where the complete cycle of @xmath17 class ( complete dip interval+complete burst interval ) is observed ( mjd 50381.49 ; obs - id : 10408 - 01 - 44 - 00 ) .",
    "all other observations show either incomplete dip intervals or partial burst intervals .",
    "hence , we are able to perform partial spectral and timing analysis during @xmath17 class . from complete data of 2011 outburst in igr j17091 - 3624 , we find 6 _ rxte_/pca observations which show hard x - ray dips similar to grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "due to low count rate ( order of magnitude lower than grs 1915 + 105 ) and small hard dip intervals ( @xmath1 20 sec ) , we merge all hard dip intervals from 6 observations to obtain a statistically significant signal strength and reasonably long dip interval ( @xmath1 154.8 sec ) for further spectral and timing analysis .",
    "observation details are provided in table 1 .    for each observation",
    ", we determine the dip time from each dip profile ( steady , persistent flux level within two consecutive rapid state transitions ; similar to @xcite ) considering both the x - ray intensity profile and hardness ratio ( hr ) profile .",
    "we consider the significant change in the hr values comparing to the flaring interval as well as the x - ray count rate close to the minimum .",
    "this allow us to exclude mixing the x - ray peaks ending the x - ray dips , even if they are hard .",
    "for example , in @xmath3 class , we found that during dip - to - burst transition , the hr below 0.08 corresponds to the steep rise phase of the x - ray spike following the x - ray dip in the intensity profile ( middle right panel of figure 1 ) and this steep rise can not be the part of dip intervals .",
    "thus , time intervals in the @xmath3 class for which hr is below 0.08 , do not belong to the dip intervals as observed in x - ray intensity profile .",
    "the reason here is that spectral parameters describing the disk blackbody and comptonization are already significantly different than during the lower part of the hard x - ray dips @xcite .",
    "considering these facts , we choose dip time intervals when hr is approximately @xmath20 0.1 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 classes , @xmath20 0.14 for @xmath2 class , @xmath20 0.08 for @xmath3 class , @xmath20 0.07 for @xmath4 class and @xmath20 0.49 for igr j17091 - 3624 .",
    "although small dispersions have been observed around selected hr limits in @xmath4 and @xmath2 class dips , choices of these hr values in different classes ensure that the dip intervals in different classes do not get mixed up with the sharp - decay and the sharp - rise part of the intensity profiles and appear to be reasonable and consistent for all observations .",
    "hr is defined as the ratio of background subtracted count rate between 12.0 - 60.0 kev and 2.0 - 12.0 kev .",
    "selected intervals are shown in red in each panel of figure 1 for different classes in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091 - 3624 . in all panels of figure 1 ,",
    "light curves where minimum count rate is normalized to 1 count / sec and corresponding time is normalized to 0 sec are shown at the top and their hardness ratio are shown at the bottom for @xmath8 ( top left panel ) , @xmath9 ( middle left panel ) , igr j17091 - 3624 ( bottom left ) , @xmath2 ( top right panel ) , @xmath3 ( middle right panel ) and @xmath4 ( bottom right panel ) classes respectively . in order to avoid dispersion due to small time bin - size ( 1 sec ) , we compute the count rate minimum position using large bin - size ( 10 sec ) and count rate minimum position from both bin - sizes are found consistent . in all panels ,",
    "examples of dip time intervals are shown by vertical black , dotted lines and hr limits for selecting dip time intervals are shown by horizontal dotted lines .",
    "it is interesting to note that dips in the x - ray intensity during @xmath4 class ( bottom right panel of figure 1 ) , is actually soft ( i.e. , low hr values ) rather than hard .",
    "this behavior is opposite to x - ray dips in all other classes .",
    "hence hard time intervals in the @xmath4 class have higher intensity than actual x - ray dips .",
    "we select high intensity hard time intervals in the @xmath4 class as persistent dip time for further analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , using both timing and spectral properties of hard x - ray dips observed from grs 1915 + 105 , we show for the first time that hard x - ray dips with the abrupt transition ( like in @xmath8 , @xmath9 classes ) show hard - lag while hard x - ray dips with the smooth evolution ( like in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 classes ) show soft - lag .",
    "frequency dependent lag spectral shape during hard - lag is different from that during soft - lag .",
    "moreover , a strong global correlation between cycle time and hard dip time for different classes is observed .    the robustness and integrity of results from grs 1915 + 105 increase when we add results from the analysis of hard x - ray dips from another bhxb igr j17091 - 3624 .",
    "hard x - ray dips from this source occupy extreme position in the timing parameter space .",
    "for example , comparing both sources using figure 2,3,4 and 5 , we find the following : ( 1 ) from the hr diagram , x - ray dips in igr j17091 - 3624 are found to be hardest among all dips , ( 2 ) average persistent dip time , average dip to burst transition time as well as average cycle time are found to be shortest in igr j17091 - 3624 , ( 3 ) intrinsic fractional variability rms in igr j17091 - 3624 is highest at all energy bands measured up to 14 kev , ( 4 ) time delays are longest in igr j17091 - 3624 above 8 kev and ( 5 ) disk temperature is lowest among all .",
    "the correlation between the total length of a cycle and the time spent in the hard dip ( figure 2 ) clearly shows that a fundamental mechanism common to both sources , but also to all variability classes ( although they obviously have differences as illustrated by the difference in the time - lag ) is at the origin of the variability patterns .",
    "previously , the relationship between the x - ray dip time and the following burst time has been established using thermal viscous instability model where the total time of the cycle is set by the time scale of the instability , while the dip / burst time - scales are set by the shape of the wave in mass accretion rate ( for example , see @xcite ) . since the dip duration is the function of mass accretion rate , then the instability model can predicts larger radio ejection events during @xmath3 and @xmath4 classes which are associated with x - ray dips longer than that of @xmath8 and @xmath9 classes .",
    "however , this scenario may not be true in the @xmath2 class where very long x - ray dips ( longer than @xmath3 and @xmath4 class , see figure 2 ) are associated with relatively low accretion rate and fainter radio ejection events than the @xmath3 class ( see figure 7 of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "because of a possible inconsistency between observed dip intervals in the @xmath7 class and dip intervals calculated using model - predicted relationship between inner disk radius and dip time - scales @xcite , the connection of these two time - scales and ejection event amplitudes , remains to be clearly understood .",
    "the correlation between two time - scales observed in figure 2 needs to be explored further and could basically have three possible origins : ( 1 ) it is the length of the hard dip intervals that eventually sets the total time - scale of a given cycle , ( 2 ) during dip time intervals and during cyclic pattern / burst structures , there may exists two distinct processes whose time - scales are correlated and ( 3 ) the total time of a cycle influences on all its individual sub - structures and thus the length of the hard dip intervals .",
    "the first possibility can be ruled out on the basis of the following argument . from figure 4 , it may be noted that @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 classes show soft - lag during dip intervals . if the observed soft - lag in these classes is due to a single physical process which is common to all , then , following the first possibility , it is difficult to explain why the process that is responsible for large oscillations during non - dip time intervals in @xmath3 or @xmath2 classes , is the same process which produces soft dips during non - dip time intervals in the @xmath4 class .",
    "it is even more difficult to comprehend as the average dip time during @xmath3 and @xmath4 classes are nearly equal ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "these facts strengthen the second possibility that the dip behavior and the non - dip behavior of all classes may be due to two distinct physical processes whose time - scales are eventually correlated .",
    "however , observing figure 2 , it may also be possible that there exists a critical cycle time above which a rapid oscillation in burst structure ( as observed in @xmath3 and @xmath2 classes ) is observed .",
    "if the observed cycle time is below the critical value , it can show smooth structures during bursts ( like in @xmath8 or @xmath9 classes ) or soft dips ( as observed in the @xmath4 class ) .",
    "however , the spectral nature of bursts may be very different from that of soft dips and hence lag properties . because of the fact that the average cycle time in the @xmath9 class is similar to that of the @xmath4 class within error - bars and given that we have few measurements , it is difficult to completely rule out the third possibility .",
    "we can not include results from hard dips in igr j17091 - 3624 into this discussion as both time intervals of different classes in igr j17091 - 3624 ( if similar classes are present in this source @xcite ) may be scaled down by some factors .",
    "interestingly , in grs 1915 + 105 , a powerlaw dependent connection between the length of hard dips , in all the different classes ( but @xmath6 ) and the amplitude of the subsequent ejection is also known @xcite .",
    "additionally , this may indicate that the cycle length are in - fine set by the amount of material accumulated and later ejected . in this case",
    ", however , the differences in the time scales of the spectral variations and the associated differences of time - lag we discover in our study ( sec . 2.2 & 2.3 ) remain to be understood .",
    "our results show that all hard x - ray dips may not have the same physical characteristics and hence a simple single scenario such as the repetitive evacuation and refilling of inner accretion disk @xcite , may not be applicable to all the different oscillations observed in grs 1915 + 105 ( see discussions of @xcite ) .",
    "soft and hard - lags observed during different oscillations do not seem to have a straight forward explanation .",
    "this has also been discussed greatly in @xcite .",
    "reflection from the disk or reverberation lags has been invoked to explain both hard and soft - lags for active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "depending upon the plasma optical depth and temperature gradient in the comptonizing region , @xcite proposed two different mechanisms of compton scattering which lead to comptonization delays that may also give rise to hard and soft - lags .",
    "the central idea of this model is that if the bulk comptonization or the corona with a temperature gradient has small optical depth , then it will show hard - lag as the scattering fraction is less . on the other hand , corona with large velocity gradient and high optical depth",
    "can show soft - lag as the compton upscattered photons , originated inside the corona , can release their energy to the relatively cooler , low - velocity electrons at the outer surface of the corona .",
    "this is indeed a versatile model , since depending on the optical depth and the temperature gradient with radii , one can get either hard or soft - lags .",
    "similarly , soft - lag due to comptonization delays is also explained by a compton up - scattering model @xcite , where the oscillation in plasma temperature is responded by the variation in the wien blackbody temperature of the soft seed photons .",
    "however , the magnitude of comptonization lags is of the order of @xmath5s , i.e. , of the order of light crossing time - scales . hence these models are applicable to those systems where the observed lag is small like lags at high qpo frequencies in neutron star x - ray binaries . in the present case ,",
    "the observed lags are of the order of @xmath1 100 - 600 msecs which would correspond to light travel - time distance of thousands of schwarzschild radii .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the observed lag in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091 - 3624 are due to reflection or comptonization lags . a hard - lag , observed in the time - scale of @xmath1 1 sec during heartbeat oscillations in grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "is explained using time - dependent computations of thermal - viscous evolution of an accretion disk which is coupled to a corona by mass exchange @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation gives no clue whether this scenario can be applied to the soft - lag , observed in the order of milliseconds , during hard x - ray dips .",
    "previously , @xcite noticed that the hard x - ray dip part of the cycle is associated with the viscous time - scale of the radiation - pressure supported inner disk . from our analysis",
    ", we find that hard x - ray dips longer than @xmath1400 sec show soft - lag while hard x - ray dips shorter than @xmath1400 sec show hard - lag where both lags at different viscous time - scales can be fitted by a straight line in the log - linear scale ( bottom right panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "a natural implication of this result is that lag time - scales and sign as well , are strongly connected to the viscous time - scales .",
    "hence , the observation of lag time - scales much longer than the light crossing ones can be explained by the viscous propagation model . here",
    "viscous fluctuations originating at an outer radii propagate inwards causing accretion rate fluctuations in the inner parts . not only can the model explain the overall power spectra seen in black hole binaries @xcite , but also explain the frequency dependent time - lags seen in these sources @xcite",
    ". however , since the outer region of the disk typically emits lower energy photons than the inner ones , the expected time - lag from this model should be hard .",
    "if the soft - lag , observed in some of the x - ray dips , is to be interpreted in the viscous fluctuation model , then the physical state of the system is unusual with high energy photons coming from outer regions .",
    "hence , the viscous propagation model is unable to explain soft - lag .",
    "it may also be speculated that different spectral components react to the basic underlying parameters like accretion rate , viscous stress , magnetic fields etc after some different time - delays , giving rise to varied time - lag behavior in photon energies .",
    "at least phenomenological ( if not fundamental ) based models are needed to develop in order to explain the observed time - lag which should be able to differentiate between any spectrally degenerate models .",
    "long term , multi - wavelength monitoring of both sources by future missions like astrosat may also provide crucial information .",

    "<S> we report a comprehensive study on spectral and timing properties of hard x - ray dips uniquely observed in some so - called variability classes of the micro - quasars grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091 - 3624 . </S>",
    "<S> these dips are characterised by a sudden decline in the 2.0@xmath060.0 kev x - ray intensity by a factor of 4 @xmath0 12 simultaneous with the increase in hardness ratio by a factor of 2 @xmath0 4 . using 31 observations of grs 1915 + 105 with _ </S>",
    "<S> rxte_/pca , we show that different behavior are observed in different types of variability classes , and we find that a dichotomy is observed between classes with abrupt transitions vs those with smoother evolution . </S>",
    "<S> for example , both energy - lag spectra and frequency - lag spectra of hard x - ray dips in classes with abrupt transitions and shorter dip intervals show hard - lag ( hard photons lag soft photons ) , while both lag spectra during hard dips in classes with smoother evolution and longer dip intervals show soft - lag . </S>",
    "<S> both lag time - scales are of the order of 100 - 600 msec . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that timing and spectral properties of hard x - ray dips observed in light curves of igr j17091 - 3624 during its 2011 outburst are consistent with the properties of the abrupt transitions in grs 1915 + 105 rather than smooth evolutions . a global correlation between the x - ray intensity cycle time and hard dip time </S>",
    "<S> is observed for both abrupt and smooth transition which may be due to two distinct physical processes whose time - scales are eventually correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications of our results in the light of some generic models . </S>"
