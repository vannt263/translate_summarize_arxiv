    "chain , the weak , @xmath2 and geometric order on @xmath0 , which coincide for @xmath6 ( but not in general ) . ]",
    "this paper is about four partial orders on the set @xmath3 of all standard young tableaux of size @xmath1 satisfying : @xmath7 here @xmath8 means that @xmath9 in @xmath10 implies @xmath9 in @xmath11 , in which case we say @xmath11 is _ stronger _ than @xmath10 ( or @xmath10 is _ weaker _ then @xmath11 ) .",
    "all four of these orders have appeared in the work of melnikov @xcite , who refers to what we are calling the weak order as the _ induced duflo order_. roughly speaking ,    1 .",
    "the weak order is induced from the weak bruhat order on the symmetric group @xmath12 via the robinson - schensted insertion map , 2 .",
    "the kl order is induced by the kazhdan - lusztig preorder on @xmath12 arising in the theory of kazhdan - lusztig ( right ) cells , 3 .",
    "geometric order describes inclusions of certain algebraic varieties indexed by tableaux ( _ orbital varieties _ ) , and 4 .",
    "chain order is induced by the dominance order on partitions ; for each interval of values @xmath13 $ ] , one restricts the tableau to these values and compares the insertion shapes in dominance order .",
    "all four of these orders on @xmath3 coincide for @xmath14 , and are depicted in figure  [ figure1 ] . for @xmath15 , they differ ( see example  [ chain - order - shape - agree ] and example  [ kl - stronger - example ] ) . after reviewing their definitions in section  [ definitions - section ] , we recall some of their known properties in section  [ known - properties - section ] .",
    "we then prove three main new results .",
    "the first result , proven in section  [ p - r - theorem - section ] , relates to a hopf algebra defined by poirier and reutenauer @xcite whose basis elements are indexed by standard young tableaux @xmath16 of all sizes .",
    "the multiplication in this hopf algebra is somewhat nontrivial to describe , but turns out to be described essentially by any of our four partial orders .",
    "[ p - r - theorem ] for any of the four partial order @xmath17 above , one has @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are obtained by sliding @xmath21 over @xmath16 from the left and from the bottom respectively .",
    "the second result is about the mbius function and homotopy type of these orders .",
    "the weak bruhat order on @xmath12 is well - known to have each interval homotopy equivalent to either a sphere or a point , and hence have mbius function values all in @xmath22 .",
    "although it is not true in general for the intervals in the weak , @xmath2 , geometric and chain orders on @xmath3 ( see figure  [ mob ] for some examples ) the interval from bottom to top is homotopy equivalent to either a sphere or a point .",
    "this result is proven in section  [ homotopy - theorem - section ] , by associating descent sets to tableaux and thereby obtaining a poset map to a boolean algebra .",
    "( @xmath23 ) an interval in @xmath24 and ( @xmath25 ) an interval in @xmath26 ordered with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 having mbius function @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . ]    [ homotopy - theorem ] let @xmath17 be any of the four partial orders .",
    "then the map @xmath32}$ ] sending a tableau to its descent set is order - preserving , and induces a homotopy equivalence of the proper parts .    in particular , for any such order @xmath33 .",
    "the third result , proven in section  [ skew - homotopy - theorem - section ] deals with a generalization of the above orders to skew tableaux with fixed inner boundary .",
    "the most crucial step in the proof is the application of rambau s suspension lemma @xcite which makes the proof ( compared to the standard methods in topological combinatorics ) much shorter and comprehensible . given a partition @xmath34 , let @xmath35 denote the set of all skew standard tableaux of having @xmath1 cells which are `` skewed by @xmath34 '' , that is , whose shape is @xmath36 for some @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that two of the four orders ( @xmath2 , geometric ) have a property ( the _ inner translation _ property ; see theorem  [ vogan - involution ] ) which allows us to generalize them on @xmath35 .",
    "each of these skew orders has a top element @xmath38 and a bottom element @xmath39 , so that one can speak of the homotopy of their _ proper parts _ obtained by removing @xmath40 .    [ skew - homotopy - theorem ]",
    "let @xmath17 be @xmath2 or geometric orders on @xmath3 .",
    "then the associated order @xmath17 on @xmath35 has the homotopy type of its proper part equal to that of @xmath41 in particular , for any such order either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , depending on @xmath34 .",
    "an illustration of the skew orders on @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath34 is ( @xmath23 ) rectangular and ( @xmath25 ) nonrectangular , @xmath46 has its proper part homotopy equivalent to a @xmath47-dimensional sphere and a point respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ skew - diagrams ] provides an illustration for theorem  [ skew - homotopy - theorem ] where both posets are considered with @xmath2 or geometric orders .",
    "in fact , this theorem follows from a more general statement ( proposition  [ skew - mobius - value - theorem ] ) about the homotopy types of certain intervals , which applies to any order between the weak and chain orders ( including the weak order itself ) .",

    "the analogy between the standard young tableaux @xmath3 and the planar binary trees @xmath49 is tightened further by recent work of hivert , novelli and thibon @xcite .",
    "they show that the planar binary trees @xmath49 can be interpreted as the plactic monoid structure given by a knuth - like relation , similar to the interpretation of the set of standard young tableaux as knuth / plactic classes .",
    "we were further motivated in proving theorem  [ p - r - theorem ] by the results of aguiar and sottile in @xcite and @xcite where the mbius functions of the weak order on @xmath12 and tamari order on @xmath49 have key roles in understanding the structures of the hopf algebras of permutations and planar binary trees .    in ( * ? ? ?",

    "it can be seen by an easy induction that there exist a saturated chain in @xmath320 of size @xmath1 with the following form : @xmath625 therefore the statement about shortest chains in @xmath287 follows .    for longest chains the proof",
