    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity  @xcite considerable effort has been made to study the behavior of strongly correlated electrons in transition metal oxides .",
    "various types of impurities , crystal structure defects , stoichiometric variations , external electric and magnetic fields , light illuminations , uniaxial or hydrostatic pressures are accessible parameters for the transition metal oxide properties of films and heterostructures . the structural tuning of \f films results in a variety of fascinating many - body phenomena .    in particular , the paradigm example of a heterostructure between the non - magnetic and insulating oxides laalo@xmath3  ( lao ) and srtio@xmath3  ( sto ) demonstrates rich physics including the coexistence of superconducting 2d electron liquid  @xcite and magnetism  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present study is to investigate the electronic properties and structural distortions of surfaces and interfaces based on lao and sto by means of density functional theory .",
    "we performed _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations within density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp 5.3 )  @xcite implemented into medea software  @xcite .",
    "exchange and correlation were included at the level of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "we have used the projector - augmented wave method  @xcite with a plane - wave basis set and a cutoff energy of 400ev . the force tolerance was 0.05 ev /   and the energy tolerance for the self - consistency loop was equal to @xmath4ev .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled on a grid of 5@xmath55@xmath51 * k*-points ( 7@xmath57@xmath51 for 4 lao/4.5 sto/4 lao heterostructure ) . in order to avoid the interaction of surfaces and slabs with their periodic images during simulation , a 20vacuum region perpendicular to the surface",
    "was added .",
    "we considered the electronic structure of an lao ( 001 ) slab that consisted of 5.5 unit cells with identical terminations on both sides ( la@xmath6o@xmath7 or al@xmath6o@xmath8 ) .",
    "the central region of 1.5 unit cells was kept fixed during the optimization as in ref .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the surface reconstruction affects intrinsic transport properties of the slab . since the la@xmath6o@xmath9 layers have a charge of + 1 and al@xmath6o@xmath8 layers have a charge of -1 per unit cell , the unreconstructed ( 1@xmath101 ) lao - terminated ( 001 ) surface lacks one electron , whereas the alo@xmath11-terminating surface has an excess of one electron .",
    "we confirmed that the lao surface with alo@xmath12-termination has lower energy per area and we will therefore focus on this structure in the discussion below .    under experimental conditions ,",
    "thin films of lao are grown on top of the sto substrate .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath13 of lao approaches the in - plane lattice parameter @xmath13 of sto @xcite , therefore the lao lattice parameter was fixed at this value ( _ _ a__=3.941from our gga calculation for bulk sto ) .",
    "it follows from our findings ( see fig .",
    "[ ris : dos_lao ] ) that the bare lao surface with alo@xmath14-termination is a semiconductor with a very small gap separating the bulk bands and a narrow surface level .",
    "it is known that the presence of impurities on the surface affects the final termination layer of lao during surface growth  @xcite .",
    "we considered the case of a hydrogen ( h ) adatom which is present in almost all growth and annealing environments .",
    "the top view of the optimized ( 2@xmath52 ) laalo@xmath0 surface with h - adatom at the surface and corresponding dos are shown in fig .",
    "[ ris : hadaton ] . as in the work of krishnaswamy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the h - adatom bonds to oxygen .",
    "it takes a position between the strontium and oxygen and is located above the surface plane . comparing fig .",
    "[ ris : dos_lao ] b , c and fig .",
    "[ ris : hadaton ] c it follows that the presence of a h - adatom leads to a \f filling of the empty states right above the fermi level of pure lao and , therefore , a suppression of the albeit small surface conductivity .",
    "the second type of surface reconstruction is caused by an oxygen ( o ) vacancy .",
    "this type is one of the most studied  @xcite . for this type of reconstruction we took a ( 2@xmath102 ) cell ( fig .",
    "[ ris : o - vac ] ) .",
    "as in the case of h - adatoms we obtained a suppression of surface conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ ris : o - vac ] c ) .",
    "we performed the same calculations for an sto slab and in contrast to lao , the sto surface did not show empty states just above the fermi level and exhibited the same insulator behavior as the bulk sto .",
    "the heterostructures in our calculations consisted of a central region of srtio@xmath1 ( with fixed number of layers @xmath15 ) bounded on both sides with a varying number of laalo@xmath1 layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lao_sto_structure ] ) . according to experimental evidence  @xcite , the _ n_-type contact with ( tio@xmath11)@xmath16-(lao)@xmath17 shows conductivity at the interface and , therefore",
    ", we have focused on this type of interface .",
    "[ sec:4 ]    [ h ! ]     we calculated the density of states profiles for a varying number of lao layers ( fig .",
    "[ ris : dos_interface ] a - c ) .",
    "it was found that the band gap decreases with an increase in the number of lao layers . at four lao layers the band gap of the lao / sto / lao heterostructure vanishes ( in agreement with  @xcite ) .",
    "layer resolved analysis of the density of states and structural deformation was performed for this system ( fig .  [ layers ] ) .",
    "[ layers ] a presents the spatially resolved dos at the fermi level @xmath18(@xmath19@xmath20 ) of a 4 lao/4.5 sto/4 lao heterostructure .",
    "the maximum intensity corresponds to surface alo@xmath14 and the tio@xmath11 layers on the interface and agrees well with previous findings  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath18(@xmath19@xmath20 ) does not vanish in the middle of the sto slab due to its small thickness during simulations .",
    "orbital decomposition of dos indicates that the electronic states at the fermi level consist entirely of ti 3d@xmath21 states , which agrees with previous work  @xcite . as in the case of a bare lao surface with alo@xmath11 termination",
    ", there is a contribution to @xmath18(@xmath19@xmath20 ) from the surface layers .",
    "( a )     octahedral systems  @xcite(c ) . ]    as a result of the dft structural optimization we obtained distortions of the lao / sto heterostructure , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lao_sto_structure ] .",
    "ti atoms moved towards the center of the slab , whereas la atoms shifted towards the surface .",
    "[ layers ] b shows the displacement of al atoms out of the oxygen planes . the biggest shift was obtained for al atoms near the lao / sto interface .",
    "the symmetrized displacements , @xmath22 , ( normal coordinates ) of tio@xmath2 octahedral system are presented in fig .",
    "[ layers ] c. @xmath23 indicates the collective atom displacements , which , under the symmetry operation , transform according to one of its irreducible representations  @xcite .",
    "the smallest magnitude was found for q@xmath24 breathing mode , which corresponds to a totally symmetric shifting of o atoms out of the center ti atom .",
    "further non - zero normal coordinates , @xmath22 , were associated with oxygen movements in @xmath25-direction perpendicular to the interface , and they led to the splitting of t@xmath26 orbital .",
    "in the present work , by means of dft calculations on the gga level of theory , we have investigated the structural and electronic properties of the surfaces and interfaces based on the two insulators , lao and sto .",
    "we found that the bare surface of lao with alo@xmath11-termination has conductive surface layers , whereas the sto surface is insulating .",
    "two considered types of surface defects ( h - adatom and o - vacancy ) of the alo@xmath11-terminated ( 001 ) lao slab lead to a suppression of surface conductivity . for the lao / sto / lao interface , an insulator - metal transition was found by increasing the number of lao layers from three to four .",
    "the largest contribution to the interface conductivity is from the tio@xmath12 layers ( ti d@xmath27 state ) , decreasing with distance from the interface .",
    "we also obtained surface conductivity , which we expect to be suppressed by defects as for the case of the lao slab .",
