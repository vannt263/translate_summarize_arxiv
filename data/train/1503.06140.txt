    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as the theory of charged particles interacting with electromagnetic fields is well understood in the context of standard perturbation theory and can describe several intriguing phenomena of nature .",
    "however , qed contains other fascinating effects that can not be explained using perturbative methods .",
    "such non - perturbative effects can arise when the electromagnetic field is so strong that it can not be treated as a perturbation . in order to understand these phenomena , it is often useful to study the behaviour of exact solutions in those external background fields .",
    "unfortunately , although the dirac equation was first formulated more than eighty years ago @xcite , the set of known exact solutions is still quite limited ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "apart from the coulomb field @xmath6 @xcite , exact solutions are known for a constant electric field and a sauter profile in space @xmath7 or time @xmath8 , for example .",
    "the latter are relevant for the non - perturbative sauter - schwinger effect @xcite corresponding to electron - positron pair creation from vacuum via tunnelling .",
    "in contrast to electron - positron pair creation in the perturbative ( multi - photon ) regime which has been observed at slac @xcite , this non - perturbative prediction of quantum field theory has not been conclusively experimentally verified yet .",
    "however , there are several experimental initiatives which might be able to eventually reach the ultra - strong field regime necessary for observing this striking effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , exact solutions are known for a constant magnetic field ( relativistic landau levels , see @xcite ) and plane waves , where the fields depend on one of the light - cone coordinates such as @xmath3 ( volkov solutions , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these ( transverse ) fields do not induce pair creation from vacuum .    nevertheless , in all these cases",
    ", the fields depend on one coordinate only ( such as @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 , or @xmath3 ) . as a result of this high degree of symmetry , the set of partial differential equations",
    "can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "an analogous limitation applies to our theoretical understanding of the sauter - schwinger effect .",
    "even though there are many results for fields which depend on one coordinate only , we are just beginning to understand the impact of the interplay between spatial and temporal dependencies , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we develop a method which allows us to obtain solutions of the dirac equation for genuinely space - time dependent fields . to this end",
    ", we pursue a different approach by assuming that we already know a solution to the dirac equation .",
    "we then calculate the vector potential @xmath9 corresponding to the given solution from the dirac equation .",
    "this is feasible as the dirac equation does not contain any derivatives of the vector potential .",
    "more generally speaking , we write down a solution to a partial differential equation and then try to find a physical problem associated with the solution  a concept also well known in the field of fluid dynamics , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "let us start with the most simple and yet non - trivial case  the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "for the following derivation , it is convenient to transform to light cone coordinates @xmath10 defined as ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 since perhaps not all readers will be familiar with the form of the subsequent expressions in light cone coordinates , let us insert a brief reminder .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation between cartesian and light cone coordinates @xmath13 yields the transformation laws for tensors such as the partial derivatives @xmath14 in 1 + 1 dimensions , the electromagnetic field strength tensor contains only one independent component , the electric field @xmath15 @xmath16 which thus reads in light cone coordinates @xmath17 transforming the cartesian minkowski metric tensor @xmath18 to light cone coordinates as well gives @xmath19 a possible choice of light cone gamma matrices satisfying the clifford algebra s anti - commutation relation @xmath20 therefore is @xmath21 note that in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions , the clifford algebra can be satisfied with @xmath22-matrices .",
    "the dirac equation , minimally coupled to the electromagnetic potential @xmath9 via the charge @xmath23 @xmath24 - m \\right ) \\psi = 0,\\ ] ] assumes the following simple form in terms of the light cone gamma matrices @xmath25 \\\\",
    "i \\sqrt{2 } \\left [ { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{-}^ { } } + i q a_- \\right ] & -m \\end{pmatrix }   \\begin{pmatrix } \\psi_1 \\\\ \\psi_2 \\end{pmatrix } = 0 .    \\label{eq : lightconediraceq}\\ ] ] traditionally , the dirac equation is treated as a partial differential equation . a solution @xmath26 for a specific potential @xmath9 is typically calculated by reducing the dirac equation to an ordinary differential equation . in our approach",
    ", we assume that we know a specific spinor @xmath27 which is a solution to the dirac equation and calculate the corresponding potential .",
    "thus , we solve for the components of @xmath9 @xmath28 for arbitrary @xmath26 , these expressions are not necessarily real .",
    "therefore , we require the imaginary parts of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to vanish , giving two conditions which we use to eliminate two real degrees of freedom of the spinor @xmath26 . using the polar representation for the spinor components @xmath31 ,",
    "these conditions can be written as @xmath32 adding the two equations gives    @xmath33    the first equation can be solved for @xmath34 by integrating with respect to @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an integration constant that may still depend on @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining equation determines the phase difference @xmath39 @xmath40 where we could also use other branches of the @xmath41-function such as @xmath42 , leading to different solutions in general  see the remark after eq .  .",
    "using the abbreviation @xmath43 and eqs .   and , we can calculate the form of the spinor @xmath26 @xmath44 where we have set @xmath45 and @xmath46 . note that we find two different solutions with @xmath47 corresponding to the different branches of the @xmath41 or square - root functions in eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "local gauge invariance allows us to eliminate the phase @xmath48 by applying a gauge transformation @xmath49 , which adds a term @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the components of @xmath9 using the spinor given in finally are @xmath52 these are obviously real as long as @xmath2 and @xmath53 are real , too .",
    "the electric field corresponding to this potential according to is @xmath54 in summary , by choosing a real generating function @xmath55 and a real supplementary boundary value function @xmath37 , we can generate arbitrary space - time dependent solutions @xmath56 of the dirac equation in the presence of an electromagnetic background @xmath9 , which can also depend on space and time .",
    "obviously , the associated electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath57 in eq .   automatically satisfies the homogeneous maxwell equations as it has been derived from a vector potential @xmath9 .",
    "if we demand that it also obeys the inhomogeneous maxwell equations ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 we have to specify the sources @xmath60 accordingly . in @xmath4 dimensions",
    "we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the charge density and @xmath63 is the current density . for non - trivial field profiles",
    "@xmath15 , they will be non - zero in general .",
    "however , this is no surprise because the only vacuum solution of the maxwell equations in @xmath4 dimensions is a constant electric field @xmath64 .",
    "in order to illustrate the approach presented in the previous section , let us discuss some exemplary solutions that can be found using this method , starting with the most simple ones .",
    "the expressions for the spinor and the potential components are significantly simplified if @xmath2 is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "choosing @xmath2 and @xmath65 to be constant , @xmath66 leads to a constant electromagnetic vector potential @xmath67 thus , a gauge transformation @xmath68 with @xmath69 can be used to set the potential components to zero and reveals that these solutions are plane wave solutions to the free dirac equation of either positive or negative energy . transforming the light - cone momenta @xmath70 back to the usual cartesian representation @xmath71",
    ", we find that the energy is given by @xmath72 .",
    "thus a solution where both @xmath2 and @xmath53 are positive ( or both negative ) corresponds to a positive energy whereas different signs of @xmath2 and @xmath53 yield a negative energy .      in this subsection",
    ", we find solutions for arbitrary light cone fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 , i.e. , pulses moving along the light lines .",
    "such solutions were found before using traditional methods as well @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the function @xmath2 depends on @xmath35 only while @xmath75 @xmath76 in this case , neither the spinor nor the vector potential depends on @xmath38 which simplifies the expression for the electric field @xmath77 this is a first - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath78 which can be integrated easily @xmath79^{-1 } , \\label{eq : singlepr}\\ ] ] with @xmath80 . comparison with sec .",
    "[ plane waves ] reveals that the pre - factor @xmath81 in front of the above @xmath35-integral over @xmath82 is just the inverse initial momentum @xmath83 . as already discussed in @xcite , the term in the square bracket in eq .   vanishes and thus @xmath2 diverges when this @xmath35-integral over @xmath82 becomes large enough to compensate @xmath84 .",
    "note that the light cone dispersion relation @xmath85 shows that @xmath86 must diverge when @xmath87 vanishes and vice versa .",
    "now , let us recall that the phenomenon of electron - positron pair creation ( such as in the sauter - schwinger effect ) can be described by the situation where an initial solution with positive energy transforms into a final solution which contains contributions with negative energies ( or vice versa ) . assuming that @xmath2 becomes constant initially and finally",
    ", we find that pair creation can only occur if @xmath78 changes its sign somewhere , i.e. , if @xmath78 vanishes or diverges at some point . if @xmath78 crosses zero , the electric field   diverges  whereas a diverging @xmath78 precisely corresponds to the case discussed above , see also @xcite .",
    "thus , we find that we can not describe particle creation in this case without introducing some singularity ( see the appendix ) .      in a similar way",
    ", we can derive solutions for electric fields only depending on @xmath38 by setting @xmath88 and letting @xmath89 depend on @xmath38 @xmath90 thus , the electric field can be calculated as follows @xmath91 which is again a first - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath92 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath93^{-1 } , \\ ] ] with @xmath94 .",
    "in complete analogy , the same arguments as for an @xmath35-dependent pulse apply in this case .      as a non - trivial extension of these two cases",
    ", we can combine the previous two solutions into a single spinor @xmath95 where the two components are given by @xmath96^{-1 } ,   \\\\",
    "s(x_- )   & =   s_\\mathrm{in } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{m } \\frac{s_\\mathrm{in}}{r_\\mathrm{in } }   q \\int_{-\\infty}^{x_- } e_-(\\tilde{x}_- ) { \\ : \\mathrm{d}^ { } \\tilde{x}_- \\ : } \\right]^{-1 } .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may calculate the electric field using and @xmath97 initially , we have @xmath98 which corresponds to two independent pulses approaching each other from different directions . when these two pulses meet , however , this is no longer true  which shows that the mapping from @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath53 ) to @xmath9 is not linear . for late times , these pulses propagate again independently , but with modified amplitudes in general .",
    "another solution where the corresponding electric field consists of two pulses can be generated by setting @xmath99 for non - vanishing @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the chosen @xmath55 will be constant almost everywhere except in the vicinity of the forward light cone ( see figure [ fig : emergingr ] ) .",
    "plot of @xmath55 as given in with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . ]    in this case , the expression for @xmath53 according to is not as simple as before because @xmath2 is not independent of @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath53 can be calculated analytically , although the resulting expressions for @xmath53 and the electric field @xmath105 are quite lengthy .",
    "thus , we will only give a plot of the resulting electric field which shows the two pulses emerging from the origin and moving along the forward light lines ( see figure [ fig : emerginge ] ) .",
    "plot of the electric field @xmath82 corresponding to the solution generated by @xmath55 given in with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . ]",
    "the approach presented here can be extended to @xmath5 dimensional space - times as well .",
    "we use the cartesian coordinate @xmath106 in addition to the light cone coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the metric tensor becomes @xmath107 in order to complete our set of gamma matrices from , we choose the third @xmath108-matrix according to @xmath109 thus the dirac equation in @xmath5 dimensions is given by @xmath110   & i \\sqrt{2 } \\left [ { \\operatorname{\\partial}_{+}^ { } } + i q a_+ \\right ]   \\\\",

    "after some calculation , we are able to write the spinor and the electromagnetic potential in terms of three real functions @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "explicitly , a spinor of the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116\\ ] ] is a solution of the dirac equation with the potential components @xmath117 in contrast to 1 + 1 dimensions , the electromagnetic field strength tensor contains three independent components , for example the two electric fields @xmath118 in @xmath1 and @xmath106 direction plus the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath119 .",
    "these components of the electromagnetic field can be calculated as follows @xmath120 we see that these expressions simplify significantly if @xmath121 and @xmath34 are independent of @xmath106 . in that case , the electromagnetic field does only depend on the light cone coordinates as before and similar solutions as in the @xmath4 dimensional case can be found , e.g. one and two wavefronts .",
    "in fact , the solutions given in section [ sec : solutions ] are solutions to the @xmath5 dimensional dirac equation as well but can be extended to also include a transverse electric and magnetic field component .    to verify that our method reproduces known solutions , we insert the lowest landau level solution @xmath122 ^ 2 \\right )   \\begin{pmatrix } 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] into our formalism , i.e. we set @xmath123 ^ 2 \\right ) ,   \\\\",

    "we have developed an inverse approach for generating families of exact solutions of the dirac equation in the presence of space - time dependent electromagnetic fields in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "somewhat similar to optimal control theory , we start with a suitable ansatz for the spinor @xmath26 and then derive the appropriate background field @xmath9 which supports this solution . in 1 + 1 dimensions , we may choose a real generating function @xmath55 and a suitable real supplementary boundary value function @xmath37 such that the radicand in eq .",
    "stays positive . in 2 + 1 dimensions , we may choose two real generating functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 as well as one real boundary value function @xmath113 .",
    "the solutions generated in this way may depend on space and time in a complicated manner  a situation which is quite difficult to treat with traditional methods .",
    "as one possible application , our method could be used to solve steering problems such as : given an initial wave - packet @xmath127 , which electromagnetic field @xmath9 induces an evolution to a prescribed final wave - packet @xmath128 ? as another application , these exact solutions could be used as touchstones for already existing exact or approximate non - perturbative derivation techniques ( e.g. the worldline instanton method @xcite ) or as starting point for new approximative methods , such as wkb @xcite or linearization around a given background solution ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the structure of the dirac equation suggests that this general strategy can also be applied to 3 + 1 dimensions , where both the potential @xmath9 and the dirac bi - spinor @xmath26 have four components .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath26 , we get four equations for the four components @xmath9 , which can be solved ( except in singular cases ) .",
    "however , the four constraints @xmath129 assume a form which is far more complicated than in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this renders the identification of real generating functions which correspond to the remaining degrees of freedom rather cumbersome .",
    "the analysis could be simplified by restricting the space - time dependence to 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions , which should be the subject of further investigations .",

    "to find solutions for electric fields that create electron - positron pairs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we use the ansatz @xmath130 where the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 as well as the eikonal function @xmath108 are slowly varying functions of the light cone coordinates .",
    "( we consider 1 + 1 dimensions for simplicity . )",
    "the main idea here is that @xmath131 is an exact solution and @xmath132 is used to slowly turn on an oscillating perturbation . the value of @xmath132 then is related to the pair creation rate .",
    "however , the calculation of @xmath53 and @xmath105 is rather complicated for arbitrary functions @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath108 because @xmath53 depends nonlinearly on @xmath2 . hence ,",
    "as the perturbation should be small , we calculate the electric field only up to linear order in @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the unperturbed force of order @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the first - order perturbation of order @xmath137 .",
    "apart from this linearization , we assume that the mass @xmath138 represents the largest energy scale in the problem and thus we employ a large-@xmath138 expansion on top of the approximation in eq .  .",
    "expanding @xmath139 into powers of @xmath138 and keeping only the highest - order term gives",

    "of course , such a rapidly oscillating force with a frequency of order @xmath138 could well create pairs , but this process would be typically in the perturbative ( multi - photon ) regime . here , we are interested in non - perturbative phenomena such as the sauter - schwinger effect and thus we demand that these rapidly oscillating contributions are absent  at least to leading order .",
    "thus , we require the term of order @xmath145 in @xmath139 to vanish .",
