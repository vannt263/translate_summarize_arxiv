    "a question fundamental to the understanding of galaxy evolution is how the properties of galaxy types evolve with redshift , and indeed , whether any distinctly new classes of objects appear at high redshifts and faint magnitudes .",
    "extensive recent work on faint galaxy imaging samples ( , tyson 1988 ; lilly , cowie , & gardner 1991 , hereafter lcg ; gardner , cowie & wainscoat 1993 , glazebrook  1994a ; cowie  1994 , hereafter paper i ; cowie  1995 , hereafter paper ii ; metcalfe  1995 ; djorgovski  1995 ; glazebrook  1995a ) has explored color and number - count distributions at both bright and faint magnitudes .",
    "these surveys find a strong excess of blue objects at faint magnitudes ( by factors of @xmath3 or more over predictions with no galaxy luminosity evolution by @xmath4 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies ( broadhurst , ellis , & shanks 1988 ; colless  1990 ; lcg ; cowie , songaila , & hu 1991 , hereafter csh ; loveday  1992 ; tresse  1993 ; lilly 1993 ; songaila  1994 , hereafter paper iii ; glazebrook  1995b ) have shown that the bulk of galaxies studied to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 have redshifts @xmath7 and that a large fraction of the strong excess of very blue objects at faint magnitudes can be identified with relatively low - mass gas - rich systems at @xmath8 ( csh ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study _ morphological _ changes in field galaxies with redshift using very deep ( 4.38 hr ) @xmath9 wfpc2 images in the ( f814w ) filter on two hawaii survey fields , ssa13 and ssa22 .",
    "the substantial increase in depth over previous field investigations with @xmath9 ( , griffiths  1994 ; glazebrook 1995c ) permits studies of the very faint - end morphologies and colors , and the construction of @xmath10-band number counts down to @xmath10=26 ; while the availability of previous multi - color imaging on these fields ( paper i ) and related wide - field surveys ( paper ii ) , in combination with near - complete spectroscopic coverage over selected subregions ( paper iii ) , allows quantification of changes in color and star - forming properties with redshift .",
    "we present a reference atlas of bright nearby galaxies , with @xmath11 , spectroscopically studied and with similar linear resolution and s / n to the @xmath9 observations , and compare it with the assembled atlas of objects from the @xmath9 samples .",
    "in addition , as we have stressed in paper i , the @xmath12-band data on these samples permits a magnitude - limited sample selection that is not biased by the type mix of galaxies being studied , since magnitudes selected in the @xmath12-band , as opposed to the @xmath13- and even the @xmath10-band , are insensitive to highly variable k corrections that , at optical wavelengths , depend on both the morphological type and redshift of the objects measured .",
    "the major result of the present paper is the identification of a new morphological class of objects at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "we call these ` chain ' galaxies , and they appear as extremely narrow , linear structures ( barely resolved by the wfc in the transverse direction ) with superposed bright ` knots ' .",
    "the chains can be identified with a spectroscopically distinct class of very blue ( flat - spectrum ) objects , which onsets in substantial numbers ( about 2 arcmin@xmath14 at @xmath15 ) at approximately @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "lcg ) , and which comprises 2050% of the population identified with the strong excess in blue number counts .",
    "the acquisition , processing , and calibration of the wfc2 data are described in  2 .",
    "a summary of the number counts and colors , showing the strong blueing trend at faint magnitudes is given in  3 .",
    "a qualitative description of the galaxy morphologies considered in terms of various color selection criteria is presented in  4 , along with a description of the characteristics and statistics of the faint blue populations .",
    " 5 discusses the properties of the chain galaxies in the context of possible models for their formation and their extreme linear structure .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the galaxy morphologies and surface brightness profiles will be given in a second paper ( hu  1995 ) .",
    "wfpc2 integrations were taken on two of the hawaii galaxy survey fields ( which are defined in lcg and paper i ) : the ssa22 field was observed with the f814w filter on the wfpc2 ( twelve 2400 s exposures on 1994 november 21 and 26 ) and the ssa13 field in the same configuration ( six 2600 s exposures on 1995 january 30 ) .",
    "each exposure was dithered by a five arcsecond step from the previous one .",
    "the pipeline - processed flattened and calibrated images were used .",
    "the sky was determined from the median of the individual frames and a normalized version subtracted from each frame .",
    "the frames were then resampled to @xmath17 pixels and registered .",
    "cosmic rays were removed by comparing each pixel with the median of the pixels in all the frames and rejecting those which deviated by more than @xmath18 .",
    "the frames were finally summed .",
    "the images of the three wfc2 frames on each field are shown as figures 1 and 2 ( plates 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the final full width half maximum ( fwhm ) was measured as @xmath19 on the ssa22 images and @xmath20 on the ssa13 image .",
    "the photometric system was derived from the photflam calibration generated in the pipeline process with 0 mag corresponding to the kron - cousins @xmath10-band zeropoint of @xmath21  from bessell ( 1979 ) . for the wfc chip 2",
    "this corresponds to @xmath22 where dn is the number of counts in a 2400 s interval in the f814w filter . for the faint galaxy photometry of the present paper",
    "we have adopted corrected aperture magnitudes using a @xmath23 diameter aperture offset by @xmath24 mag to correct to total magnitudes .",
    "the offset was measured by comparison with @xmath25 diameter aperture magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath23 diameter aperture is the smallest usable aperture in which the correction to total magnitude is relatively invariant from object to object .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  3 , where we show the difference between @xmath23 and @xmath26 diameter aperture magnitudes for isolated objects in the fields ; the spread in total magnitudes corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately @xmath27 mag in the total magnitude of an object , which we consider acceptable for the present type of work . for smaller apertures",
    "the spread rises rapidly .",
    "the @xmath28 magnitudes closely approximate the ground - based @xmath10 magnitudes of paper i. in fig .",
    "4 we show @xmath29 vs  where @xmath10 and @xmath13 are from papers i and ii .",
    "the least squares fit gives a small color term @xmath30  and a dispersion of @xmath31 mag .",
    "for the present purposes we ignore the color term and use @xmath28 and @xmath10 interchangeably . because of the characteristic flat spectrum of many sources , it has sometimes been the convention to quote object magnitudes in terms of @xmath32 magnitudes  a system where the zero - points for the various color bands @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 coincide for objects which are flat in . following the discussion of lcg",
    ", we give the conversion between kron - cousins @xmath36 magnitude and @xmath37 as @xmath38 , and @xmath39  and @xmath40  for johnson @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "we shall occasionally move to the @xmath41 system where it is appropriate .    for each field",
    "a primary catalog was generated of all objects with surface brightness above 24.7 mag arcsec@xmath14 in a @xmath42 boxcar - smoothed image .",
    "objects with centers closer than @xmath23 were then combined and the magnitudes measured following the procedure outlined above .",
    "the star - galaxy separation was made using the inverse second moment classifier ( kron 1980 ) . @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath12 magnitudes for the @xmath10-selected samples were obtained for the object list from the ground - based data using the procedures outlined in paper i. in addition , @xmath10 magnitudes were measured from the @xmath9 data for ground - based @xmath12- and @xmath13-selected samples .",
    "the noise levels for each field were next determined by measuring the dispersion of the signal from blank sky positions on each image .",
    "the @xmath43 level for the corrected total magnitudes is similar for the 13- and 22-hr fields at @xmath44 , since the 13-hr field is at much higher ecliptic latitude and the background is 22 mag arcsec@xmath14 vs 21.5 mag arcsec@xmath14 for the 22-hr field .    finally , the incompleteness of the object recovery was measured as a function of magnitude .",
    "we adopted the procedure of adding , to the data in each wfc2 chip , field data from another of the two wfc2 fields reduced by a factor of 10 , and then re - running the cataloging procedure .",
    "the fraction of the added objects which were retrieved was then determined .",
    "the incompleteness becomes substantial at magnitudes greater than @xmath45 : only 52% of objects between @xmath45 and 26 were recovered .",
    "we have therefore computed the galaxy counts only to @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath10 band counts from the two fields are shown in fig .",
    "5 . they extend the previous deepest @xmath10-band counts from ground based data by about 1.5 mag to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and there is good agreement with the ground - based data in the region of overlap ( tyson 1988 ; lcg ) .",
    "the faint @xmath10 counts are well fit by the power law @xmath48 galaxies deg@xmath14 mag@xmath49 .",
    "the galaxy counts are now becoming very well defined to extremely faint magnitudes over the full optical and near - ir range .",
    "6 shows a compilation of recent faint @xmath12-band counts from a number of groups .",
    "these are well fit by @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , or equivalently , @xmath53 .",
    "the faint @xmath13-band counts have recently been summarized by metcalfe  ( 1995 ) and to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) have the form @xmath56 .",
    "the counts in each color are compared in fig .  7 , which shows just how remarkable the blueing trend in the galaxy population really is .",
    "at the faintest @xmath41 magnitudes ( @xmath57 ) the @xmath12 counts have fallen below the @xmath10 counts , and both have closely approached the @xmath13 counts .",
    "this requires that the vast majority of the faintest galaxies are very blue , with spectra close to flat @xmath58 over the full range @xmath59 .    at slightly brighter magnitudes we can investigate the colors of",
    "individually selected galaxies . fig .",
    "8 shows the  colors of a @xmath60 sample selected from the ground - based data .",
    "the substantial improvement in the s / n of the @xmath10-band data obtained with @xmath9 now allows us to see that at the faint end the population is dominated by blue  galaxies , with a small number of very red  objects . at @xmath61",
    "the median color is therefore very blue with @xmath62@xmath63  ( only 0.6  mag redder than flat @xmath58 ) , but this is determined by 80% of the objects ( 12 out of 15 ) .",
    "the remaining 20% ( 3 out of 15 ) are quite red .",
    "9 shows the  colors of an @xmath64 sample selected from the full @xmath9 data . at @xmath45",
    "the median  color of a galaxy is only 1.2 , less than 0.5 mag different from flat - spectrum .",
    "for the purposes of studying the morphology of normal galaxies at @xmath65 it is almost essential to use a near - infrared selection , since even an @xmath10-band selection results in k correction biases against higher redshift elliptical and spiral galaxies ( paper i ) . as a result ,",
    "direct selection from the @xmath9 data results in a serious bias to lower @xmath66 and blue galaxies . for our primary analysis ,",
    "therefore , we have used the @xmath12-band selected samples of papers i and iii to define the sample , and then used the @xmath0 @xmath10- band images to study the morphology .    at @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "10 , plate 3 ) we show all the objects in the @xmath9 fields .",
    "the @xmath12-band magnitudes ( lower left corner of each panel ) are taken from the @xmath12-band strip data of paper iii . in order to provide uniform contrast",
    "we have normalized each image by its @xmath10-band flux so that sky noise levels appear higher for the fainter objects .",
    "all of the objects have spectroscopic identifications either from paper iii or from subsequent observations with the lris spectrograph on the keck 10 m telescope ( songaila  1995 ) .",
    "the galaxy redshifts are presented in the lower right corner of each panel .",
    "11 ( plate 4 ) shows the corresponding data for @xmath68 selected from the strips for the 22-hr field where the strip image is much deeper , but only in the deep field region of paper i in the 13-hr field . finally , fig .  12 ( plate 5 ) shows the data for a @xmath69 sample selected from only the deep field @xmath12 samples of paper i. all but three galaxies of the @xmath70 sample",
    "have measured redshifts , but only slightly less than half of the @xmath71 sample do .",
    "we can see from the plates that at @xmath72 we appear to be selecting a rather normal population of galaxies .",
    "the redshift data show that nearly all of these objects are at @xmath7 . for comparison",
    "we have shown a ground - based complete @xmath11 selected sample ( fig .  13 , plate 6 ) of 25 spectroscopically identified galaxies displayed at a similar linear scale and s / n as the @xmath9 data .",
    "as we shall address more quantitatively in the second paper ( hu  1995 ) , the distribution of types and sizes is remarkably similar between the bright and faint samples .    at @xmath73",
    "the morphologies of the galaxies become much more diverse .",
    "12 continues to show some galaxies with relatively normal appearance , but there is now a large fraction of amorphous and distorted galaxies , as well as a population ( # s 6 , 16 , and 19 ) of just - resolved , symmetric objects which are very faint in the @xmath10 band .",
    "the onset of the morphology change corresponds to the onset of the blueing of the @xmath12-selected samples , and the bifurcation into blue and red populations in the color - magnitude diagram of fig .  8 ; it may also be associated with the movement of the maximum redshift beyond @xmath74 . at @xmath75 , as the 4000break moves through the @xmath10 band , galaxies fade rapidly and the redder objects in the @xmath71 sample most probably correspond to the high - redshift @xmath76 tail of spirals or ellipticals ( paper i ) .",
    "the simultaneous appearance of the amorphous galaxies is more surprising .",
    "for the small number of galaxies where redshifts have been measured these are emission - line objects at moderate redshift @xmath77 . at @xmath69",
    "they constitute almost half the objects and completely dominate the blue populations .",
    "the most likely explanation is that because of volume geometry effects and/or galaxy evolution we are seeing relatively few high-@xmath66 galaxies , and that as we move to fainter magnitudes our samples are rapidly becoming dominated by the faint end of the luminosity function of modest redshift galaxies .",
    "the faint end slope of the counts and the blueing trend then correspond to the shape and colors of the faint end of the luminosity function .    at fainter magnitudes",
    "we have constructed a @xmath78 atlas for the 22-hr deep field and a @xmath79 atlas for the 13-hr deep field ( figs .",
    "14 and 15 , plates 7 and 8) .",
    "there is very little redshift information for this faint end sample ; however , at these @xmath12 magnitudes the population is dominated by the blue  galaxies : only 9 objects have  colors even in excess of 3 .",
    "unusual morphologies also dominate at the faint end : roughly half of these unusual objects are the amorphous galaxies that are the majority of the @xmath80 counts , but now we also see a considerable population of a new class of object which appears narrow and linear , and often has a beaded morphology .",
    "prototype examples are objects 4 , 5 , 9 , and 15 of fig .  14 . a substantial fraction of the @xmath78 galaxies fall into this category .",
    "they appear similar to the morphological class of chain galaxies in the arp atlas ( 1966 ) and we shall refer to them as chain galaxies in the subsequent text .    to loosely quantify these changes in the mix of morphologies",
    "we have adopted a crude galaxy classification in which galaxies with a strong nucleus and surrounding smooth envelope are classified as type 1 , those with a strong nucleus and apparent spiral arm structure as type 2 , and those with an amorphous appearance as type 3 .",
    "very roughly , type 1 includes the hubble types e / s0/sa , type 2 the sb s and sc s , and type 3 the sd s and i m s .",
    "we have also distinguished two further classes of galaxies  type 4 , corresponding to galaxies with strong signs of interaction , and type 5 , corresponding to the chain galaxies described above .",
    "glazebrook ( 1995c ) have used a similar breakdown in analyzing the medium deep survey but with our types 35 combined into a single category of peculiar and merging galaxies .",
    "the distinction between type 1 and type 2 is poorest , and becomes very uncertain at the faintest magnitudes , but the remaining types are easily picked out .    we have summarized the distribution of types vs @xmath12 magnitude in fig .  16 . at @xmath81",
    "nearly all galaxies are type 1 or type 2 in roughly equal numbers with a small admixture of interacting galaxies ( type 4 ) . at @xmath82",
    "the type 3 galaxies appear in substantial numbers , while at @xmath83 the chain galaxies of type 5 become the largest class .",
    "as glazebrook  ( 1995c ) have emphasized , this rapid evolution in morphology has major implications for interpreting galaxy number counts . in fig .",
    "17 we show the fraction of galaxies in the @xmath12-band counts that fall into the type 1 and 2 categories .",
    "this ` normal ' fraction has dropped to less than 20% at @xmath84 .",
    "glazebrook  have argued that the @xmath13-band galaxy counts may be modelled by including the normal population ( here types 1 and 2 ) with no evolution in the number density or luminosity , and then adding the rapidly evolving population of peculiar and interacting galaxies ( here types 35 ) .",
    "however , this model does not provide an adequate description of the @xmath12 counts . as gardner  ( 1993 )",
    "have shown , there is an excess of @xmath12 counts at @xmath51 over models in which there is no luminosity evolution .",
    "however , from figs .  16 and 17",
    "we can see that at this magnitude there is very little contamination by the type 35 populations which therefore can not be the explanation for this excess .",
    "it is probable that the type 1 and 2 galaxies are also evolving , and this evolution may well be correlated with the onset of the other types .",
    "if this is true we will need to develop a wider understanding of the nature of the evolution before we can begin fully to reinterpret the number counts .",
    "because the anomalous faint - end population is so blue we have also considered the morphology in the @xmath13-selected sample . for each of the two fields",
    "a complete @xmath85 atlas was formed in the three @xmath9 wfc areas .",
    "the 71 objects in the sample are shown in figs .",
    "18 and 19 ( plates 9 and 10 ) .",
    "each frame in these plates is @xmath26 on a side .",
    "the @xmath13 magnitude is shown in the lower left corner and the redshift ( where known ) in the lower right corner .",
    "at least 6 of the magnitude - selected sample are stars based on the spectroscopic observations while 21 of the objects are very blue , satisfying the color criterion @xmath86 ( paper i ) .",
    "these latter objects are marked ` flat ' in the upper right hand corner .",
    "all but one of the spectroscopically observed objects at @xmath87 have been identified . at @xmath88",
    "all objects are at @xmath89 whereas for @xmath90 , 6 of the 23 objects with redshifts are at @xmath75 .",
    "this redshift distribution in the _ hst _ fields is consistent with the much larger sample of songaila et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    inspection of plates 9 and 10 shows that the flat spectrum galaxies are split into several morphological classes .",
    "there are low - redshift extragalactic  regions and i m galaxies such as object 8 in fig .",
    "19 and object  4 in fig .  18 , which are at very modest redshifts . these are small diffuse objects , and roughly a third of the @xmath91 flat - spectrum objects fall into this morphology class . however , many of the remaining flat objects consist of the chain galaxies noted in the @xmath12-band data .",
    "a further unusual multicellular morphology which may be related in some way to the chains is seen in object 26 of fig .",
    "18 , where a set of blobs is immersed in a more diffuse circular envelope .",
    "the object with peculiar morphology reported by glazebrook  ( 1994b ) may be a bright example of this class .",
    "the remaining flat spectrum galaxies have single or slightly elongated very marginally resolved images .",
    "examples are objects 8 and 9 in fig .",
    "18 . if the chain galaxies are linear , some of these objects could correspond to chain galaxies seen in projection .",
    "clearly defined chain galaxies comprise 6 of the 41 galaxies in the @xmath92 magnitude range ( objects 11 , 23 and 29 in fig .",
    "19 and objects 15 , 17 , and 25 in fig .  18 ) while more questionable cases could roughly double this number .",
    "thus the chains constitute @xmath93% of the objects at @xmath4 and do not comprise the majority of the excess blue counts seen at this magnitude , which appears to be produced by a combination of the chains and of the excess number of low redshift galaxies .",
    "the exact value of the blue excess at @xmath4 is uncertain , but lies between a factor 2 and 4 ( , tyson 1988 ; lcg ; metcalfe  1991 ; glazebrook  1995a ) .",
    "this means that in rough terms the chain galaxies may contribute @xmath94% of the excess at this blue magnitude .",
    "the chain galaxies seem to be a new class of object which appears in the faintest magnitude samples and is associated in part with the extreme blueing seen in the faint galaxies .",
    "their curious morphologies and high spatial frequency make them an extremely interesting class .    to determine the spread in the properties of the chain galaxies ,",
    "we have formed an atlas of all galaxies with @xmath95  in the @xmath0  fields that clearly show the chain morphology .",
    "the 26 objects selected in this way from the two fields are shown in figures 20a  c ( plates 11 , 12 and 13 ) and their properties are summarized in table  1 where we give the @xmath12 , @xmath10  and @xmath13  magnitudes , the transverse width when the point spread function is deconvolved , and an axial ratio , defined here as the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse lengths of the undeconvolved surface brightness contour corresponding to 20% of the peak surface brightness .",
    "the chain galaxies are uniformly blue at the brighter magnitudes where the colors can be measured reliably . in fig .",
    "21 we compare the  colors of chains with @xmath96  with the full sample of @xmath96  galaxies .",
    "the chains clearly fall along the lower envelope of the field galaxies , having a median  = 1.6 .",
    "the uniformly blue color of the sample argues that , irrespective of the origin of the light , the objects can not be at redshift @xmath97  since otherwise some would lie behind intergalactic clouds which are opaque beyond the wavelength of the lyman limit and would extinguish the @xmath13  light .",
    "( cf.madau [ 1995 ] for a recent discussion of this effect . )",
    "the chains are also extremely blue in  ( table  1 ) and are generally only marginally detected in _ k_. this rules out the possibility that we are seeing relatively normal galaxies in the rest ultraviolet and that the peculiar morphologies are a consequence only of the distribution of the star - forming regions .",
    "morphologically , we find that the chains are extremely narrow in their transverse extent , being only marginally resolved in the transverse dimension with sizes @xmath98 .",
    "the longitudinal sizes are around @xmath99 .",
    "( the measured dimensions are summarized in table 1 . )",
    "these very large ellipticities argue strongly against these being any class of edge - on object .",
    "the linear extent of each blob in the chain is similar to their transverse dimensions while blob separations are about @xmath100 , or several times larger ( cf .",
    "the extremely narrow transverse widths argue against the chain population being local , since at redshifts where the euclidean approximation is valid the transverse dimensions are only @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the hubble constant in units of 75 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 and @xmath103 is the transverse dimension in arcseconds . if we assume instead that the chains are at redshifts @xmath104 then the individual blob dimensions correspond to a linear size of @xmath105 kpc .",
    "the spread in the transverse sizes is also quite small , only a factor of four .",
    "this also suggests that the objects must lie at @xmath106  where the angular distance becomes relatively invariant since otherwise they would have to be confined to a narrow shell in redshift .",
    "we have some limited spectroscopic information on the brighter chain galaxies .",
    "chains  0 and 1 of fig .",
    "20a are emission line galaxies at @xmath107  and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "two further objects , ssa2216 and ssa2224 , were identified as unusually blue in the lcg sample and were the subject of intensive study .",
    "ssa2216 ( which is object 4 in fig .  14 and object 3 in fig .",
    "20a ) has a strong emission line and appears to lie at @xmath109  ( fig .",
    "in contrast , the optical spectrum of ssa2224 ( object 9 in fig .  14 and object 6 in fig .",
    "20a)is featureless except for a continuum break near @xmath110  in the observed frame ( lcg ) .",
    "the simplest explanation of the color and spectral information is that the chain galaxies are intense star forming galaxies which , if the  line has redshifted out of the optical window at @xmath111 , appear as relatively featureless flat spectrum objects until the  wavelength moves into the observable window at @xmath112 .  emission is weak , analogous to low - redshift extragalactic  regions and i m s , but the imposed signature of the intergalactic  forest produces a partial break at shorter wavelengths ( madau 1995 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the break in ssa2224 would then place it at @xmath113 .",
    "while recognizing the indirect nature of these arguments and the limited nature of the spectroscopic information , we therefore suggest that the chain galaxies consist of star - forming regions and lie in the redshift range , @xmath114 . at these redshifts",
    "the typical chain would contain about @xmath115  ob stars and have a mass larger than or comparable to that of a present - day galaxy .",
    "this brings us finally to the strangest feature of the galaxies  their linear structure .",
    "given the ubiquity of these objects , we assume that this is not a gravitational lensing phenomenon but rather represents their intrinsic nature",
    ". since the linear morphologies are inherently unstable and will disrupt on a timescale comparable to the transverse crossing time which is only @xmath116 where @xmath117  is the transverse velocity , it is probable that we are seeing the structures in the process of formation .",
    "the simplest explanation may be that linear structures form during the collapse of the protogalactic gas and when star formation turns on it triggers induced star formation along the line of maximum density  a process analogous to the sequential propagation of ob star associations in molecular clouds in our own galaxy .",
    "however , there may be other mechanisms  such as string - induced wakes ( brandenberger 1991 )  which might more naturally produce a linear structure .",
    "using @xmath0  @xmath10-band images of a @xmath12-selected galaxy sample , we have shown that the faint - end galaxy counts at @xmath118  are dominated by blue galaxies with unusual morphologies and that at @xmath119 , the largest single class is a new type of of galaxy with linear , often beaded , structure which we refer to as a chain galaxy .",
    "based on indirect evidence and our limited spectroscopic information , we have argued that the chain galaxies are lines of giant star - forming regions at redshifts between 0.5 and 3 .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the chains are very large galaxies in the process of formation .",
    "the key question remaining is whether the chains are a transient population of galaxies unrelated to present - day galaxies or whether they are their lineal ancestors .",
    "songaila , cowie & lilly ( 1990 ) have given model - independent arguments that the blue galaxy population , of which the may chains comprise a major part , do contain enough star formation to be the progenitors of present - day galaxies . however , in this case we would expect to see ` missing links ' with morphologies intermediate between the chains and current galaxies .",
    "one candidate is the amorphous multicellular galaxies described here and in glazebrook  ( 1994b ) which could represent the first stage in the dissolution of the linear structure of the chains prior to the onset of more normal spiral morphology .",
    "investigation of the kinematics and colors of these objects should determine if this is a tenable hypothesis .",
