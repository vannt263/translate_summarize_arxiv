    "the central engines most likely to launch these jets are hyperaccreting black holes @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a relativistic jet emerges from a system with a massive accretion disk ( @xmath3 ) surrounding a stellar - mass black hole , a system expected to form after a cataclysmic event such as the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a merger of a neutron star - neutron star binary @xcite .",
    "the observed luminosity requires a very large mass accretion rate , @xmath4 .",
    "in such a case the accretion flow is extremely optically thick with respect to photons and it can not cool efficiently via radiation .",
    "however , since the density and temperature are very large ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) when the mass accretion rate is sufficiently high , neutrino cooling becomes efficient .",
    "such disks are ` neutrino - dominated accretion flows ' ( ndafs ; @xcite ; see also chapter 10.6 of @xcite ) .    the accreting system must launch a relativistic jet to produce a grb .",
    "neutrino pair annihilation ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) and magnetohydrodynamical mechanism such as blandford - znajek process @xcite are the two processes most discussed in the literature .",
    "the goal of this work is to estimate the luminosity of the jets emerging from a hyperaccretion flow driven by an mhd mechanism , as well as the luminosity of thermal neutrinos emitted from the disk .",
    "the first is estimated using the maximal magnetic field sustainable on the event horizon , which is expected to be limited by the pressure in the disk near the isco , the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite . the second we calculate directly from the density , pressure , and lepton number of the material in the disk .    in section  2",
    "we predict the jet power in the mhd model by solving for the structure of a surrounding ndaf and compare this luminosity to the energy deposition rate via neutrino pair annihilation above the accretion flow .",
    "we discuss the parameter dependence of our model and its application to grb jets in section  3 .",
    "we summarize our results in section  4 .",
    "we consider a rotating black hole whose horizon is threaded by a large - scale poloidal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the poynting luminosity expected from such a system is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the poloidal magnetic field strength on the horizon and @xmath10 is the gravitational radius of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we estimate the jet luminosity as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an increasing function of @xmath13 whose exact form depends on the specific field configuration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there have been some attempts to calculate @xmath12 analytically for specified field geometries @xcite , but these configurations were not required to be consistent with the dynamics of the surrounding accretion flow .",
    "they were also relatively simple poloidal topologies , but as @xcite showed , high jet power requires that the vertical component of the magnetic field maintain the same sign for long times ; in other words , low - order poloidal topologies are the most favorable to strong jets .",
    "consequently , it is possible for @xmath12 to vary over an extremely wide range , from very small numbers to @xmath14 . when the topology is optimal and @xmath15 , the @xmath12 arising from a dynamically self - consistent field structure",
    "can be @xmath16 , and even larger for spin parameters closer to unity @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the magnetic pressure near the horizon may be limited by the inner disk pressure .",
    "the magnetic field energy may therefore be estimated ( or at least bounded ) by the disk pressure @xmath17 near the isco : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the pressure reference point and @xmath20 is the ratio of the midplane pressure at @xmath19 to the magnetic pressure in the black hole s stretched horizon .    to evaluate the midplane pressure of the hyperaccretion flow , we solve for the disk structure in the innermost region ( @xmath21 ) , where the jet is expected to be launched .",
    "as we show below , the behavior of an hyperaccretion disk is mainly determined by its mass accretion rate @xmath22 . to highlight what we believe to be the principal physical mechanisms ( and",
    "also eliminate mathematical complications ) , we adopt a highly simplified model for this structure in the expectation that the trends we uncover while exploring a factor of @xmath23 range in @xmath24 will be robust with respect to refinements in the model . in particular , we assume that both the disk dynamics and the gravitational potential are newtonian despite the fact that this near a black hole general relativistic effects are important .",
    "we also assume that the system is stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "we adopt the shakura - sunyaev formalism for the disk structure , which formally applies only to thin disks , assumes that the inflow speed is very small compared to the orbital speed , and parameterizes the @xmath25-@xmath26 component of the stress @xcite . when the disk becomes geometrically thick , in the advection - dominated regimes",
    ", we use in our analytic estimates ( but not in the numerical solution ) a dimensional analysis .",
    "remarkably the results are similar up to a numerical coefficient to those obtained using the shakura & sunyaev model .",
    "we further set the correction factor @xmath27 appearing in equation  [ angcons ] to always be unity , when it should in fact be somewhat less than that .",
    "these are rough approximations , but we nonetheless expect our results to give the right qualitative picture in this scenario . here",
    "we present the basic disk equations for the density @xmath28 , the temperature @xmath29 , and the scale height @xmath30 .",
    "these are the expressions for mass conservation , angular momentum conservation , energy conservation , and hydrostatic balance applied at @xmath19 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denote the surface density ( @xmath36 ) , radial velocity , angular velocity ( @xmath37 ) , and ratio of integrated stress to integrated pressure , respectively . in newtonian dynamics",
    ", the factor @xmath38 accounts for the reduction in stress due to the net angular momentum flux through the disk ; although the net angular momentum flux per unit mass accreted has traditionally been identified with the specific angular momentum of orbits at the isco @xcite , it also depends upon mhd effects @xcite .",
    "the pressure @xmath17 is the sum of the contributions from radiation , baryonic gas , degenerate electrons , and neutrinos ( if they are trapped ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the radiation constant , @xmath41 is the boltzman constant , and @xmath42 is the mass of a proton . the first term on the right hand side represents the contribution from both photons and relativistic electron - positron pairs ; the coefficient is 11/12 when the temperature is higher than @xmath43 .",
    "in the third term , which corresponds to degeneracy pressure , @xmath44 is the electron fraction , which should be evaluated from the @xmath45-equilibrium condition , and when neutrino emission is not efficient the electron fraction should be nearly equal to 0.5 . in the numerical calculations we make use of a bridging formula in evaluating @xmath44 to connect these two extreme regimes smoothly . ]",

    "there are several significant neutrino emission processes expected in such a hyperaccretion flow ( see also @xcite and references therein ) : electron / positron capture on nuclei ( @xmath57 ; @xmath58 , also known as the urca process ) , electron - positron pair annihilation ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents electron- , mu- , and tau - type neutrinos ) , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung ( @xmath61 ) , and plasmon decay ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we should also take into account the neutrino optical depth in the accretion flow , which can be larger than unity when the mass accretion rate is sufficiently large .",

    "the detailed description of these neutrino opacities can be found in @xcite .",
    "when the optical depth is so large that the neutrino diffusion timescale in the accretion flow is longer than the accretion timescale , neutrinos are completely trapped in the accretion flow . in that state ,",
    "advective cooling dominates : @xmath68 .",
    "the accretion flow would also be advection - dominated when the mass accretion rate is small enough that the density and temperature of the disk are so low that neutrinos are not efficiently emitted , but is still much larger than the eddington accretion rate .",
    "we can divide the hyperaccretion flow into several regimes according to the dominant physical processes taking place .",
    "in particular , the cooling processes ( advection , optically - thin neutrino emission and optically - thick neutrino emission ) and the pressure components ( radiation , baryonic gas , and degenerate electrons ) vary from one regime to another . in the rest of this section",

    "( [ jetlum ] ) . inspection of figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] reveals a sharp break in the nature of the disk and jet at @xmath78 , the transition from advection to neutrino cooling . in order to interpret this break ,",
    "we have constructed an approximate analytical model for hyperaccretion disk structure .",
    "this model can qualitatively reproduce not only the physical properties of the flow , but also the mass accretion rates at which one regime changes to another .        when the mass accretion rate is not large enough for the disk to cool efficiently via neutrino emission , the accretion flow is advection - dominated , and the pressure is dominated by photons and relativistic electron / positron pairs . in this regime ,",
    "the accretion flow is geometrically thick and the thin - disk approximation is not valid .",
    "instead , we can estimate the disk pressure using dimensional analysis . because the aspect ratio of the accretion flow @xmath81 , the density at @xmath19 is @xmath82 ) .",
    "as the gas does not cool efficiently , the ratio of pressure to density ( i.e. the square of the sound speed ) is close to the virial temperature @xmath83 . using the relation between @xmath33 and the circular orbital speed @xmath84 , @xmath85 ,",
    "the pressure can be evaluated as : @xmath86 using this expression for @xmath17 we estimate the jet luminosity as @xmath87 the corresponding energy efficiency of the jet : @xmath88 is independent of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the accretion flow is advection - dominated as long as the neutrino emissivity per unit volume is smaller than half the advective cooling rate . in this regime ,",
    "neutrino emission is dominated by electron / positron capture , and the neutrino emissivity @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( popham , woosley & fryer 1999 ) .",

    "a transition takes place when @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 above this accretion rate the accretion flow is no longer advection - dominated , as neutrino cooling determines the structure of the flow .",
    "in addition , the dominant pressure source is no longer radiation , but baryonic gas pressure . in the following , we call this transition mass accretion rate @xmath100 ( `` ign '' stands for ignition of neutrino emission ) .      in this regime the disk is mainly cooled by neutrino emission via electron / positron capture , while the pressure is dominated by baryonic gas ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this case , the pressure can be expressed as @xmath104 the neutrino cooling rate per unit surface area by electron / positron capture is given by eq .",

    "the efficiency @xmath77 is : @xmath109 and is independent of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the higher jet luminosity and efficiency in this regime is the result of more efficient neutrino cooling , which leads to a geometrically thinner accretion flow .",
    "thinner disks accrete more slowly . in the end ,",
    "the midplane pressure @xmath17 increases , permitting it to confine a stronger magnetic field on the black hole s event horizon .",
    "this stronger magnetic field supports a more powerful jet .",
    "the system is very optically thin to neutrinos at this stage : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the optical depth due to nucleon absorption and scattering , respectively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the total optical depth for electron neutrinos @xmath113 exceeds unity only when @xmath114 and then our expression for @xmath52 would not be valid .",
    "this mass accretion rate marks the transition to the third regime , which is optically thick to @xmath102 . in the following we call this transition @xmath115 .      in this regime",
    "the innermost region of the disk is optically thick to electron neutrinos , and the opacity is dominated by absorption onto nucleons . while the disk is not so optically thick that the neutrinos are totally trapped in the flow , the cooling rate is : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the neutrino optical depth .",
    "first we consider the case in which the disk is optically thick only to @xmath102 and thin for @xmath119 and @xmath120 . with cooling only by electron neutrino emission ,",
    "the cooling rate is @xmath121 which should be equated with the heating rate in the energy balance equation .",
    "solving the fundamental equations of the disk we derive its density , temperature and scale height : @xmath122 the disk pressure in the midplane is @xmath123 and the jet luminosity is @xmath124 the dependence on the mass accretion rate is weaker than in the last regime .",
    "the efficiency is : @xmath125 in order for the disk to cool by neutrinos efficiently , the neutrino diffusion time @xmath126 must be shorter than the accretion time @xmath127 .",
    "this condition can be expressed as @xmath128 and when the mass accretion rate exceeds this value , electron neutrinos are no longer able to escape the disk .",
    "we call it @xmath129 . for the other kinds of neutrinos ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) ,",
    "the diffusion time is still shorter than the accretion time , so they can cool the disk efficiently .",
    "this is the fourth regime , which we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "even when the mass accretion rate is so large that @xmath102s are completely trapped in the disk , @xmath119s and @xmath120s emitted via the electron - positron pair annihilation process may escape the disk so long as their diffusion time is shorter than the accretion time .",
    "for those neutrinos , the opacity is dominated by scattering on nucleons ( eq .  [ taus ] ) .",
    "then the cooling rate is @xmath132 where the factor 2 in the first line represents the number of flavors of neutrinos that we are interested in ( @xmath119/@xmath133 and @xmath120/@xmath134 ) . substituting this @xmath52 into eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , we derive the disk properties : @xmath135 the disk pressure is then @xmath136 and the jet luminosity is @xmath137 the luminosity now depends on the mass accretion rate in the same way as in the last regime .",
    "the efficiency is @xmath138 the timescale for @xmath139/@xmath140 neutrinos to escape the disk diffusively is @xmath141 and the accretion timescale is @xmath142 therefore , @xmath139/@xmath140 neutrinos can escape an accretion flow without being trapped as long as @xmath143 at this mass accretion rate , there is a transition to the fifth and last regime , in which the accretion flow is once more advection - dominated .      when the mass accretion rate is so large that the all kinds of neutrinos are trapped , the accretion flow can not cool and the flow is advection - dominated . in this case",
    "the pressure would be dominated by several kinds of relativistic particles , photons , relativistic electron - positron pairs , and all three flavors of neutrinos .",
    "we can estimate the disk pressure in a way similar to sec .",
    "2.2.1 to find @xmath147 the jet luminosity is then @xmath148 as a result , the efficiency is the same as in equation  ( [ eff1 ] ) , @xmath149      in the discussion above , we have picked out the four mass accretion rates that divide the five states of an hyperaccretion flow .",
    "however , the sequence we have presented does not always apply .",
    "these mass accretion rates are functions of @xmath35 , @xmath150 , and @xmath19 , and in some regions of parameter space , the transition from advection - dominated flow to neutrino - cooled flow ( @xmath100 ) takes place at a higher accretion rate than the transition to optically thick flow ( with respect to @xmath102 ) .",
    "this means that the second regime of optically thick neutrino cooling does not exist for these parameters .",
    "for example , we show the transition mass accretion rates as functions of the black hole mass ( while the other parameters are fixed at @xmath151 and @xmath72 ) in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "one can see that there is a critical black hole mass at which the first transition and the second transition change places , and also that for this choice of parameters the mass accretion rate range of the optically - thin ndaf regime is quite narrow , if it exists at all . in figure",
    "[ f4]we show @xmath152 for various parameter sets as functions of the black hole mass . for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , the curve is well above @xmath152 , and the optically - thin ndaf regime exists for each of those parameter sets .",
    "the general condition for such a change in the order of the transition points is : @xmath155    when this condition is satisfied , advection - dominated flow transforms directly to optically thick neutrino cooling at ( [ trans2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f5]displays the limited range of parameters satisfying this condition .",
    "in other words , except in the case of extreme values of the parameters , the five states for hyperaccretion flows are ordered as we have described them .",
    "from the analytic model presented above , we can estimate the jet luminosity and efficiency expected from a hyperaccreton flow as functions of mass accretion rate for various choices of parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath150 , @xmath19 ) . figure  [ f6 ] shows how the jet luminosity based on the bz scenario ( thick lines ) depends on the mass accretion rate .",
    "the different lines show the results for different parameters .",
    "we can see that with all parameter sets , the jet luminosity has a significant discontinuity at @xmath100 .",
    "this jump , as explained already , arises from the transition between an advection - dominated accretion flow , in which neutrino cooling is not efficient , and a neutrino - dominated accretion flow .    in the top panel",
    ", we can see that for larger black hole mass the mass accretion rate at which the transition from the advection - dominated flow to the neutrino - cooled flow ( @xmath100 ) is larger .",
    "the value of @xmath100 rises from @xmath156  s@xmath157 at @xmath158 to @xmath159  s@xmath157 at @xmath160 .",
    "this is because the temperature of the accretion flow is lower for larger black hole mass when the radius ( in units of the gravitational radius ) and the mass accretion rate are fixed .",
    "therefore , a larger mass accretion rate is needed for an accretion flow around a larger black hole to cool efficiently via neutrino emission .",
    "a similar explanation also applies to the bottom panel , which shows the dependence of the jet luminosity on @xmath19 . here , for smaller @xmath19",
    "the temperature of the accretion flow is higher , which results in a smaller @xmath100 and larger luminosity . over the range of plausible values of @xmath19 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath100 is much smaller than for the dependence on @xmath161 : it changes by only a factor @xmath162 .",
    "the middle panel shows that the jet luminosity depends quite strongly on the stress / pressure ratio in the sense that for larger @xmath35 , the luminosity is smaller ; equivalently , @xmath100 increases with increasing @xmath35 . over a span of a factor of 30 in @xmath35 , from @xmath163 to @xmath151",
    ", @xmath100 increases by a factor of 300 . to interpret this behavior",
    ", we note that the inflow rate is proportional to @xmath35 ( i.e. the accretion timescale is proportional to @xmath164 ) .",
    "therefore , when @xmath35 is larger in the radiation - dominated advective regime , the midplane pressure is smaller ( eqn .",
    "[ pres1 ] ) .",
    "the temperature is also lower ( eqn .",
    "[ rhotempadvect ] ) .",
    "these two trends together diminish the neutrino cooling rate , forcing the transition accretion rate higher .",
    "they are reinforced by the scalings on the opposite side of the transition , in which @xmath165 , while the temperature depends much more weakly on @xmath35 ( only @xmath166 ) .",
    "thus , the jet luminosity is strongly reduced by a larger stress / pressure ratio .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] similarly shows how the jet efficiency depends on our three free parameters .",
    "as we have previously emphasized , the principal dependence is on accretion regime : the jet efficiency is greatest when the flow is in the optically thin neutrino - cooling state .",
    "although this state occurs over different ranges of accretion rate for different black hole masses , the efficiency achieved there varies rather little with @xmath150 . on the other hand , even after allowing for the different accretion rate ranges in which the flow is neutrino - cooled , it is quite sensitive to both @xmath35 and @xmath167 . in that favored regime",
    ", @xmath168 is roughly @xmath169 .",
    "still more dramatically , a factor of 3 decrease in @xmath167 leads to a factor of 30 increase in @xmath168 at the respective peaks of jet efficiency in the optically - thin neutrino - cooled state  and this comparison is taken at fixed @xmath12 , whereas realistically one would expect smaller @xmath167 to be associated with more rapid spin and therefore a significant increase in @xmath12 .",
    "note that in a small region of the lower panel @xmath170 . while possible , in principle , in a bz process , our newtonian approximation is not suitable to explore this regime .",
    "neutrino - antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons ( hereafter  neutrino pair annihilation \" ) above the accretion flow @xcite is another mechanism proposed for the energy source of relativistic jets that power grbs .",
    "it is worth comparing the luminosity and efficiency of such neutrino pair annihilation driven jets with the bz driven jets expected from our ndaf model .    in estimating the energy deposition rate due to neutrino pair annihilation above a hyperaccretion flow",

    "the neutrino luminosity is generally two orders of magnitude smaller than the bz jet luminosity . in the accretion rate range",
    "most favorably to the bz mechanism , the ratio is at least another order of magnitude larger .",
    "thus , even if @xmath12 is as small as @xmath183 , the bz mechanism dominates at all accretion rates ; in its favored range , it can be as small as @xmath184 and still generate a larger luminosity than the neutrino mechanism . when comparing the jet peak luminosity with those observed in typical grbs , @xmath185 , after beaming corrections @xcite we find that with our fiducial parameters those require accretion rate larger than @xmath186 .",
    "the drop by a factor of @xmath187 in the efficiency at the transition @xmath100 may be a mechanism that strongly modulates the jet power , leading to the observed variability in grbs .",
    "we have examined the blandford - znajek jet luminosity and efficiency expected from hyperaccreting black holes , investigating the possibility that such a jet can account for observed grbs .",
    "following @xcite , we estimated the poynting luminosity using a simple dimensional argument : we assumed that the intensity of the magnetic field responsible for launching the jet is linked to the pressure in the innermost region of the accretion flow . by using an ndaf solution at the innermost region of the accretion flow ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the luminosity of this poynting - dominated jet can easily exceed the energy deposition rate expected from neutrino pair annihilation above the accretion flow .",
    "this means that mhd processes around the black hole horizon are a plausible mechanism for the formation of the relativistic jets required from the observations of grbs .",
    "in addition , we have derived the jet luminosity as a function of mass accretion rate and have shown that it has a step function - like behavior at a mass accretion rate corresponding to the transition between an advection - dominated accretion flow and a neutrino - dominated accretion flow .",
    "this means that the jet power suddenly drops when the mass accretion rate decreases and crosses @xmath100 . in the context of grbs",
    ", this jump may correspond to switching on and off the activity needed for internal shocks .",
    "it may also explain the steep decay ( @xmath188 ) often observed after the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the mhd jet formation process is most efficient when the accretion flow efficiently cools via optically - thin neutrino emission . in this regime , the jet luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath22 , i.e. , the efficiency does not depend on @xmath22 .",
    "we stress that the bz jet luminosity is larger than the energy deposition rate via neutrino pair annihilation whenever @xmath189 . in the optimal accretion range of accretion rates",

    "<S> the jet luminosity is much larger than the energy deposition through neutrino - antineutrino annihilation ( @xmath0 ) provided that the black hole is spinning rapidly enough . when the accretion rate onto a rapidly spinning black hole is large enough ( @xmath1 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted jet luminosity is sufficient to drive a grb . </S>"
