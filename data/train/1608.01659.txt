    "strong gravity affecting an accretion disc in vicinity of a black hole horizon governs three observationally significant phenomena enabling to determine the black hole mass @xmath0 and the dimensionless spin @xmath1 .",
    "the phenomena are related to the timing effects , namely to the frequencies of the hf qpos and connected lf qpos , to the spectral continuum of the accretion disc , and the fe spectral lines profiled by the influence of the black hole spacetime .",
    "the most interesting ( and precise ) information is connected to the twin hf qpos observed with the fixed frequency ratio @xmath3 in the microquasars grs 1915 + 105 , xte j1550 - 56 , and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "such twin hf qpos can be explained by the so called geodesic oscillation models using frequencies of the geodesic epicyclic motion in the field of kerr black holes , i.e. , the orbital frequency , @xmath8 , and the epicyclic radial , @xmath9 , and latitudinal , @xmath10 , frequencies .",
    "however , the twin hf qpos in the three microquasars can not be explained by a fixed oscillation model , if we assume a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "a unique , epicyclic resonance model exists @xcite if we assume central kerr naked singularities that demonstrate special properties of the prograde circular motion @xcite .    in the case of the grs 1915 + 105 microquasar ,",
    "the @xmath3 hf qpos can be explained by the epicyclic resonance model @xcite , while for the xte j1550 - 56 and gro j1655 - 40 microquasars , the twin hf qpos and the related lf qpo can be explained by the relativistic precession model @xcite that is by definition combined with the relativistic nodal model of the lf qpos @xcite .    in the case of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 the limits on the black hole mass and spin implied by the models of the twin hf qpos are in agreement with the limits implied by the spectral measurements @xcite , and agreements of limits implied by models of the qpos and the models of spectral measurements has been demonstrated also in the case of the xte j1550 - 56 microquasar @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of the microquasar gro j1655 - 40 , the spin limits of the spectral ( continuum and fe - line ) measurements @xcite are contradicting each other , and , moreover , they are both contradicting the spin limits implied by the geodesic models of qpos @xcite , if the limits on the black hole mass determined by the dynamical studies based on optical measurements @xcite are considered .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the controversial restrictions on the gro j1655 - 40 black hole mass and spin .",
    "keeping the relevance of the mass restrictions implied by the weak gravity dynamical models based on the optical measurements of the binary system that have high relevance and are quite independent of the timing and spectral measurements connected with the strong gravity near the black hole horizon , we first discuss the possibility to obtain an agreement of the twin hf qpo geodesic models and any of the spectral methods , and then we test possibility of agreement of the string loop oscillation model of twin hf qpos with the predictions of the spectral measurements .",
    "the gro j1655 - 40 low - mass - x - ray - binary ( lmxb ) source is one of the extensively studied galactic microquasars , i.e. , the sources where the accreting central object is assumed to be a black hole . however , controversial estimates of the gro j1655 - 40 black hole gravitational mass @xmath0 and dimensionless spin @xmath1 have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "we first summarize origin of this controversy related in the strong gravity regime to models of x - ray spectral measurements implying limits on the black hole spin , and the so called geodesic models of qpos implying in the strong gravity regime limits on the black hole mass and spin that are confronted with the limits on the black hole mass implied by dynamical studies in the weak gravity regime .",
    "mass of the gro j1655 - 40 black hole is restricted by dynamical methods related to spectro - photometric optical measurements @xcite that are not related to the timing studies of qpos based on the x - ray measurements , and have high degree of credibility as they are related to the weak field gravity techniques .",
    "the range of allowed values of the black hole mass implied by the optical measurements reads @xcite m_opt = ( 5.40.3 )  m_. [ mopt ]    note that there exists an earlier and larger estimate of the gro j1655 - 40 black hole mass determined in @xcite that reads m_bh = ( 7.020.22 )  m_. [ mopt2 ] however , the later estimate presented in @xcite is in recent papers considered as the relevant one .",
    "the x - ray spectroscopy techniques give in the case of the gro j1655 - 40 microquasar controversial results .",
    "the spectral continuum measurements @xcite predict the black hole spin in the range 0.65 < a < 0.75 . [ a - cont ]",
    "the measurements of the fe spectral lines profiled by the strong gravity of the black hole predict @xcite 0.94 < a < 0.98 .",
    "[ a - line ] clearly , there is a strong discrepancy between the results of spectral measurements related to radiation processes in the strong gravity regime .",
    "we could expect that the timing effects related to qpos occuring in the strong gravity regime could help to determine the correct spectral measurements due to the spin estimates .",
    "the rossi xte observatory brings many timing measurements of the x - rays emitted by the gro j1655 - 40 source that are summarized in @xcite .",
    "interesting are those related to the twin hf qpos and the lf qpos .",
    "the lf qpos were observed between 0.1  hz and 30  hz , usually independently on the hf qpos .",
    "however , most important is observation of twin hf qpos with frequencies stabilized at the lower frequency @xmath11  hz and the upper frequency @xmath12  hz that were observed simultaneously ; then it is natural to assume that the twin hf qpos are related to a common radius where both the observed oscillatory modes occur .",
    "the twin hf qpos were reported for the first time in @xcite where simultaneously with the twin hf qpos a lf qpo was reported at @xmath13  hz . the magnitude of the observed frequencies and the character of the oscillations indicate strongly that the twin hf qpos should occur in close vicinity of the black hole horizon , being related to the orbital motion .    the special simultaneous observation of the twin hf qpos and the lf qpo enables to obtain stringent restrictions on the mass and dimensionless spin of the central black hole , if we assume that all of these qpos arise at a given radius of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo technique applied to the observational data and the relativistic precession ( rp ) model , belonging to the geodesic models of twin hf qpos , with the frequency identification @xmath14 and @xmath15 , along with the related relativistic nodal precession model of the lf qpo with the frequency identification @xmath16 , implied for the black hole mass and spin the limits @xcite m = ( 5.310.07 )  m_,a = 0.2900.003 .",
    "[ m - a - mot ]    the mass limit is in very good agreement with the mass limit given by the optical measurements .",

    "recently , the standard nodal precession model of the lf qpos and a variety of the geodesic models of twin hf qpos , i.e. , models using frequencies of the oscillatory modes combined from the frequencies of the geodesic epicyclic motion , has been tested for matching to observational data of the simultaneously observed twin hf qpos and lf qpo in the microquasar gro j1655 - 40 ; models originally proposed to explain only the twin hf qpos were generalized to interpret also the lf qpo by the relativistic nodal precession @xcite . instead of the monte carlo technique ,",
    "the method of frequency relations introduced in @xcite has been used @xcite , and the fitting has been done to the data of the twin hf qpos and simultaneous lf qpo presented as sample b1 in tab.2 . of @xcite .",

    "[ fff ]    for all the considered models of twin hf qpos it was assumed that both the twin hf qpos and the lf qpo arise at a common radius .",
    "then the frequency relation technique enables to obtain a mass - spin relation @xmath18 for the twin hf qpos with frequency ratio parameter p = ( ) ^2 , and due to the assumption of the common radius a mass - spin relation @xmath19 can be determined for the lf qpo .",
    "the two relations imply the limits on the black hole mass and spin related to the qpo measurements @xcite .",
    "it has been found in @xcite that three geodesic models can predict the mass in agreement with the optical measurement limit . along with the rp models when the frequency relation method implies the limits",
    "m = ( 5.30.1 )  m_,a = 0.2860.004 , [ m - a - rp ] in agreement with the estimates given by the monte carlo technique results in @xcite , only two other twin hf qpos models can fit the optical mass limit . first is the so called total precession model , with the frequency identification given by @xmath15 and @xmath20 , implying the limits m = ( 5.50.1 )  m_,a = 0.2760.003 .",

    "[ m - a - re1 ] clearly , all the models predict the black hole spin @xmath17 . we conclude that",
    ", unfortunately , none of the considered geodesic oscillatory models of twin hf qpos combined with the nodal precession model of lf qpos can predict values of the black hole spin that could be matched to the predictions of the x - ray spectral measurements , if we assume that the simultaneously measured qpos occur at the same radius being thus physically related .",
    "( for completeness , we have tested also the fitting to the mass estimate @xmath23  then the models denoted in @xcite as epicyclic resonance model er3 and the tidal distortion model td meet this mass limit for the spin ranges @xmath24 and @xmath25 that are again in contradiction with the results of both the spin spectral estimates . )",
    "the controversy of the gro j1655 - 40 black hole spin estimates could be solved by using models of twin hf qpos that are based on frequencies reflecting non - geodesic effects , including thus not only the kerr spacetime parameters , but also some additional parameters related to the non - geodesic phenomena .",
    "we test in the present paper the string loop oscillation model @xcite potentially reflecting the influence of tension related to internal toroidal magnetic fields in accretion discs @xcite .",
    "of course , it is worth to consider also possibilities keeping the assumption of the purely geodesic ( gravitational ) origin of the oscillatory modes giving rise to the twin hf qpos and the lf qpo .",
    "we discuss this possibility in the following section .",
    "in order to keep assumption of validity of purely geodesic models of twin hf qpos for explanation of observed qpos in the gro j1655 - 40 microquasar and enable possibility to match the black hole spin values predicted by the spectral measurements methods and the mass limit given by the optical measurements , we have to abandon the assumption that the dimensionless radius @xmath26 where the twin hf qpos occur coincides with the dimensionless radius @xmath27 where the simultaneously observed lf qpo occurs .",
    "the hf qpos and the lf qpo are thus assumed to be physically independent . we still keep assumption that the lf qpo is determined by the relativistic nodal oscillations , but these lf oscillations are not correlated with the twin hf qpos .",
    "then we can treat the three simultaneously observed qpos by the frequency relation method proposed in @xcite , but the version introduced in @xcite has to be slightly modified due to the fact that we do not assume @xmath28 .",
    "of course , we can determine the ratio of these two radii in dependence on the twin hf qpos model , in the range of allowed values of the black hole spin .",
    "we first introduce the geodesic models of qpo and then we use them to fit the qpo data observed in gro j1655 - 40 source .      in the kerr spacetimes ,",
    "circular geodesics exist only in the equatorial plane @xcite .",

    "the radial profiles of the epicyclic frequencies are illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "since all the frequencies @xmath33 have the same mass scaling , it is clear that in the geodesic models of twin hf qpos containing only linear combinations of these frequencies , the frequency ratio of the lower and upper frequencies will be independent of the mass parameter @xmath0 , being dependent only on the spin parameter @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this fact enables an effective application of the frequency relation method in the case of the geodesic models of twin hf qpos .",
    "+        the geodesic models of twin hf qpos can be separated into three classes : the hot spot models ( the rp model and its variants @xcite , the tidal precession model @xcite ) , resonance models @xcite and disc oscillation ( discoseismic ) models @xcite .",
    "these models were applied to match the twin hf qpos and the lf qpo in the microquasar gro j1655 - 40 @xcite .",
