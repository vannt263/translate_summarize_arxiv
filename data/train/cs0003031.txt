    "in this paper we put forward a new approach to changes in knowledge bases .",
    "two main reasons led us to this approach to belief revision .",
    "one of these reasons originates in the intuition that in a belief revision process only part of the knowledge base has an active role in the integration of a new belief in the base .",
    "therefore a belief revision process involving only that sub - system of beliefs can capture the essence of this process and reach the same effects as the traditional way of belief changing with a diminished processing effort .",
    "the other idea comes naturally when the belief revision process is placed in a communication environment .",
    "people are changing their minds when interacting with the world , including the others beliefs , and usually when they are looking for answers to their questions .",
    "not every fact or evidence is worth incorporating in our belief systems but only information that is relevant for us with respect to our informational needs .",
    "consider that two intelligent agents are involved in a goal - driven dialogue .",
    "one of them , called the inquirer , is  interested \" in acquiring a piece of information that would produce , by means of a belief revision process , the fulfillment of its objective or _",
    "desideratum_. the other agent s role is to present _ facts _ that would help the inquirer attain its goal .    given an incoming piece of information , one s beliefs , and the desideratum , our purpose is to process the available information _ efficiently _ in order to fulfill the desideratum .",
    "we use terms like _ optimal _ and _ efficiency _ throughout this paper with the meaning of a comparison or ratio between the effects and effort corresponding to a belief revision process . however , these terms are not related to computational complexity . instead ,",
    "the _ effects _ represent information derived when incorporating a piece of evidence in the knowledge base ; the _ effort _ required to reach such effects is mostly characterized by the notion of _ accessibility_. a formal definition of the accessibility ordering will be provided later in this paper .",
    "we call this way of revising belief systems _ optimal belief revision_. defining a way of revising a knowledge base efficiently reduces to choosing _",
    "optimal contexts_. the notion of context is related to and determined by three parameters : the new belief , one s knowledge base and the desideratum , and it represents any part of the knowledge base that actually contributes to the integration of the new belief .",
    "the optimal context is a context in which the new piece of information will be the most efficiently processed such that the desideratum is met .",
    "both constructive and descriptive approaches to contexts are considered . in the third section",
    "we stipulate the conditions that circumscribe the set of context candidates , from which the optimal context is chosen . in the fourth section",
    "we give an explicit construction for ( optimal ) contexts .",
    "in the fifth section we introduce the concept of accessibility . finally , for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases ( theories ) , we define a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated .",
    "also , we will see how from a finite accessibility ranking one can adjust the ranking of a repeatedly revised belief set .",
    "we mention three important sources related to our work .",
    "firstly , the axiomatic and constructive approaches for contraction functions presented in grdendors ( 1988 ) serve as models for characterizing ( optimal ) contexts from the same perspectives .",
    "moreover , the definition and analysis of epistemic entrenchment in relation to contraction functions guided us in defining the accessibility notion and relate it to modelling optimal contexts .",
    "secondly , relevance theory introduced in sperber and wilson ( 1986 ) motivated us to apply relevance theory to belief revision by placing agents in a communicative environment .",
    "thirdly , in williams ( 1998 ) , mary - anne williams uses a finite partial entrenchment ranking to generate an entrenchment ordering and describes a computational model that adjusts this ranking using an absolute measure of minimal change .",
    "later sections of our paper focus on the same matters using the accessibility relation instead .",
    "consider a language * l * whose logic includes classical propositional logic .",
    "beliefs and contexts are represented by closed sets of sentences ( belief sets ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be the initial belief set of the inquirer .",
    "suppose that the inquirer s objective / desideratum is based on a _ presupposition _",
    "@xmath1 , which is a sentence in * l * , precisely a disjunction of possible answers to a question : p = @xmath2 .",
    "we consider that the presupposition is one of the beliefs in k , @xmath3 .",
    "each @xmath4 is called a basic goal . a disjunction of at most @xmath5 such basic goals is considered also a goal . any goal achieves the desideratum , but a basic goal is preferred rather than a goal .    to attain its desideratum ,",
    "the inquirer must derive one of these goals from a belief revision process .",
    "let @xmath6 be the new piece of information acquired by the inquirer , which is used in the belief revision process .",
    "in this setting , contexts are considered subsets of @xmath7 that are also closed under logical consequence . choosing a context whenever some new evidence is incorporated in @xmath7",
    "depends upon three parameters : the belief set @xmath7 , the new evidence @xmath8 and a certain goal @xmath9 or desideratum .",
    "they will appear as constants throughout our analysis .",
    "contexts are considered optimal if for some @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the effort required for processing @xmath8 in that context such that @xmath9 is derived is as small as possible . both",
    "the notion of accessibility and the number of sentences in a context have to be considered in assessing a certain processing effort .",
    "the next theorem provides a description of ( potentially optimal ) contexts given the above - cited parameters .",
    "the first part ( _ i ) _ ) of theorem 1 characterizes contexts when no desideratum or goal is assumed .",
    "the second part adds new conditions for contexts when this parameter is considered as well .",
    "it is supposed that the revision , expansion and contraction operators respect the agm postulates .",
    "let @xmath7 be a belief set and  * \" a revision operator .",
    "let us denote by  @xmath10 \" the contraction operator that is related to  * \" through the levi identity .",
    ", @xmath11 .",
    "see grdenfors ( 1988 ) p.69 . ]    1 .   for any belief set @xmath12 , if @xmath13 @xmath14.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "if there is a sentence @xmath15 , such that + ( a ) @xmath16 ; ( b ) @xmath17 + then there is a belief set @xmath12 satisfying condition ( 1 ) and :    * @xmath18 if @xmath19 ; * @xmath20 ; * if @xmath21 then @xmath22 .    since in the limiting case @xmath23 can be identified with @xmath7 , the first part of theorem 1 says that for any belief set @xmath7 we can always identify a sub - theory @xmath23 of @xmath7 , whose revision with a new belief @xmath8 tells us exactly what sentences are retracted from @xmath7 when revising @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath23 is chosen such that exactly the same beliefs are retracted from both @xmath7 and @xmath23 when revising these belief sets with the same sentence @xmath8 .",
    "this means that no sentences that could contribute to the derivation of @xmath8 are left in the remainder @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , attaching the revised  context \" to this remainder does not lead to the negation of @xmath8 , unless @xmath25 is a tautology .",
    "the relationship between a belief set @xmath7 and one of its contexts associated to @xmath8 are presented in the following corollary :    for a revision operator  * \" and two belief sets @xmath7 and @xmath23 such that @xmath12 and @xmath26 , the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath27 ; ( _ monotony _ ) + 2 .",
    "@xmath28 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath29 if @xmath30 .",
    "in order to understand the significance of part _ ii ) _ of theorem 1 , consider the following situation : an agent makes inquiries in order to attain a certain information - goal @xmath9 that would achieve its desideratum . in order to choose the right context , one should focus on two aspects :    1 .",
    "the context should include those sentences that help to establish which beliefs are being retracted from the initial belief set in order to accommodate the new evidence ; 2 .",
    "the context should include the beliefs that together with the new one contribute to the derivation of the goal .",
    "if one is interested in choosing contexts that satisfy the first requirement then the solution is to be found in theorem 1 part _",
    "i)_. precisely , a minimal belief set @xmath31 is required .",
    "note that for a given @xmath7 , the set of all @xmath23 satisfying the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) specified by the theorem is partially ordered .",

    "must satisfy additional restrictions , as specified in part _ ii ) _ of theorem 1 . condition _",
    "ii ) _ stipulates the following : supposing that the goal can only be contextually derived and can be implied by neither the new evidence @xmath8 nor the initial knowledge base @xmath7 , we want to choose such a context @xmath23 that does not become empty after retracting @xmath25 from it .",
    "this condition makes sense even when @xmath32 since it requires that @xmath23 is nonempty as long as the goal is contextually derived from @xmath8 .",
    "the second part of _ ii ) _ says that the goal will be obtained from the processing of the new evidence @xmath8 in the context @xmath23 .",
    "also if the agent s original base includes the negation of the goal , in order to derive the goal from the revised knowledge base , @xmath33 must be contained in the context @xmath23 .",
    "note that when processing a piece of information @xmath8 in a context @xmath23 , if that belief is already part of the agent s old knowledge base then there is no goal @xmath9 satisfying the conditions specified in _",
    "ii)_. in this case , attaining goal @xmath9 is already achieved without incorporating @xmath8 in @xmath7 .",
    "the revision of @xmath23 with @xmath8 could only result in a change in the entrenchment degree of @xmath8 , provided that an epistemic entrenchment ordering for @xmath7 ( and for @xmath23 ) is assumed .",
    "belief sets that satisfy conditions ( 1 ) and ii ) form a partially ordered set having at least one @xmath34-minimal element . by choosing a minimal @xmath23",
    ", we ensure the minimality requirement of an optimal context .",
    "the minimality requirement is present also in the constructive approach to optimal contexts .",
    "theorem 1 can be reformulated for bases of belief sets .",
    "the changes consist of replacing belief set @xmath7 with the base @xmath35 and @xmath23 with a subset @xmath36 of @xmath35 , @xmath37 with @xmath38 , etc .",
    "there are several ways to construct contexts : from entailment - sets of @xmath25 and @xmath9 , from maximal subsets of @xmath7 that fail to entail @xmath25 , using grove s system of spheres and from epistemic entrenchment and accessibility orderings . for lack of space",

    "theorem 1 describes contexts in a general manner without providing a mechanism for defining a specific ( optimal ) context . in this section",
    "we introduce the notion of accessibility as an additional structure for belief sets that allows us to model optimal contexts .    this relation is defined over sentences in * l * , as well as over contexts / sets of sentences . the notion of accessibility",
    "is based on the idea that depending on the order in which our beliefs were acquired , we can assign them a certain degree of accessibility or we can rank them according to the rule : the last acquired belief is the most accessible one .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath52 for  b is at least as accessible as a \" .",
    "the importance of the accessibility notion in the construction of optimal contexts is supported by the ability of this concept to characterize the effort required to access pieces of information from someone s knowledge base .",
    "further , using the accessibility notion one can express the effort required to process some piece of information in a certain context .",
    "a set of sentences or a context will be considered as accessible as its least accessible element .",
    "the reason is that whenever one wants to access a certain context or to process some piece of information in that context , the effort required for such an operation is determined by the effort necessary to access the least accessible sentence in that context .",
    "for any set of sentences @xmath53 in * l * , if @xmath54 and @xmath52 for all @xmath55 then @xmath56 .",
    "iff @xmath52 and @xmath57 .",
    "]    instead of defining the accessibility of sentences in a quantitative way , we rather axiomatically define the qualitative aspect of this notion by introducing five new postulates .",
    "given a belief set @xmath7 in * l * , an accessibility order related to @xmath7 is a relation @xmath58 on * l * satisfying the following conditions : listi    1 .",
    "if @xmath52 and @xmath59 then @xmath60 ; ( transitivity ) 2 .",
    "for every two sentences @xmath61 , either @xmath52 or @xmath57 ; 3 .   @xmath62 ; 4 .   @xmath63 if and only if @xmath52 for all @xmath64 ; 5 .   given @xmath35 such that @xmath65 , for any set of sentences @xmath66 such that @xmath67 is the most accessible @xmath8-entailment set in @xmath35 and @xmath68 , the accessibility rank of @xmath8 is determined by the accessibility rank of @xmath69 .    the first two postulates define @xmath70 as a total transitive binary relation over sentences in * l*. conditions ( a3 ) and ( a4 ) are better understood if we consider that for a belief set @xmath7 , the accessibility rank of a sentence @xmath6 is determined by the lowest accessibility level to which we need to go in @xmath7 in order to determine whether or not @xmath8 is the case ( given @xmath7 ) . _ is the case given _",
    "@xmath7 if and only if @xmath37 ; @xmath8 _ is not the case given _ @xmath7 if and only if @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath8 _ is undetermined given _ @xmath7 if and only if @xmath73 . ]",
    "if @xmath37 , for instance , then the rank of @xmath8 is already known . if @xmath72 then @xmath8 has the same accessibility level as @xmath25 since finding out that @xmath25 is the case leads to finding out that @xmath8 is not the case .",
    "this explains postulate ( a3 ) . also , if neither @xmath8 nor @xmath25 are in @xmath7 then it is impossible to find out given @xmath7 whether @xmath8 ( and similarly , @xmath25 ) is the case or not .",
    "therefore , for this last case , @xmath8 would be among those sentences whose level of accessibility is the lowest .",
    "this gives us a reason for formulating the fourth postulate .",
    "note that condition ( a5 ) does not hold in case @xmath8 is a sentence in @xmath35 .",
    "since sentences in @xmath35 are independently acquired , they are ranked according only to the order in which they have been incorporated in the base , regardless of their logical relationship .",
    "in contrast , the accessibility ranking of the information that is derived from the base will be ranked only according to the ranks of the sentences from which it is obtained by derivation .",
    "formally , we can describe the relation between the accessibility ordering and optimal contexts as follows .",
    "consider some belief set @xmath7 , a sentence @xmath6 , and two sub - theories of @xmath74 , both satisfying conditions ( 1 ) and ii ) as specified in theorem 1 .",
    "then @xmath75 is preferred over @xmath76 as a potentially optimal context if and only if @xmath75 is more accessible than @xmath76 .",
    "the postulates suggest the following conclusion and motivate the next two definitions .",
    "the number of accessibility levels in a base of a belief set is the same as the number of accessibility levels in the belief set generated from that base .",
    "moreover , the accessibility ordering of the base determines the accessibility ordering of the belief set generated from the base .",
    "this property results from the last postulate , ( a5 ) .    for a belief set @xmath7 , an accessibility ordering @xmath58 and a sentence @xmath37",
    ", we define @xmath77 .    for a belief set @xmath7 , a base @xmath35 of @xmath7 , an accessibility ordering @xmath58 and a sentence @xmath37",
    ", we say that @xmath78 is a _ bad cut _ if there is a sentence @xmath79 such that @xmath80 $ ] but @xmath81 .",
    "note then the following result :    for an accessibility ordering @xmath58 , a belief set @xmath7 and sentence @xmath82 , if @xmath78 is not a bad cut then @xmath78 is a belief set .",
    "this theorem provides a solution for the construction of optimal contexts .",
    "precisely , this result allows us to conclude that the subset @xmath23 which contains @xmath7 s most accessible sentences and satisfies conditions ( 1 ) and _ ii ) _ as stipulated in theorem 1 is or includes an optimal context .",
    "however , if @xmath23 represents a bad cut , an optimal context is a subset of the logical closure of @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we define a finite accessibility ranking from which we will then generate a finitely representable accessibility ordering .",
    "the reason for this action is to overcome the representation problem whenever an accessibility ordering ranks an infinite number of sentences . a finite accessibility ranking ranks the sentences of a finite knowledge base .",
    "we will see that for axiomatizable theories / belief sets we can generate an ordering that ranks all the sentences of that theory / belief set from that finite ranking .    a finite accessibility ranking is an integer function @xmath83 $ ] such that @xmath84 $ ] ; where @xmath53 is a finite set of sentences in * l * and natural numbers 0 to @xmath85 designate ranks .    the next definition introduces a way of extending the domain of the finite ranking _ af _ to all the sentences in the language .",

    "note that for @xmath106 , where @xmath35 is a finite set of sentences such that @xmath65 , @xmath103 is the accessibility ordering related to @xmath7 . since @xmath35 is finite , @xmath7 is a finitely axiomatizable theory . in this case",
    "the finite accessibility ranking _",
    "af _ generates an accessibility ranking @xmath103 over @xmath7 .",
    "in the introduction it was mentioned that the inquirer s desideratum can be fulfilled by several goals .",
    "therefore , iterative revisions allow the agent to get closer with each step to the fulfillment of its desideratum . for each iteration",
    "a certain goal is attained .",
    "each such goal can either override the previously derived goal(s ) or represent a sub - goal of a final goal that is achieved after a number of such iterations .",

    "all the beliefs in the original base are assigned their initial level of accessibility .",
    "the sentences that are retracted from @xmath35 when @xmath8 is incorporated are assigned the accessibility ranking / degree as stipulated in part c ) of definition 8 .",
