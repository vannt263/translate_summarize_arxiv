    "are high curie temperature , high electron spin polarization at the fermi level and very small lattice mismatch with widely employed semiconductors @xcite . some of the heusler compounds were found to have half - metallic ground state @xcite characterized by a 100% spin - polarization of the charge carriers .",

    "there are only two systems of this type studied experimentally : mn@xmath0val @xcite and mn@xmath0vga @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath0val received much experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "the neutron diffraction experiment by itoh et al . @xcite gave the ferrimagnetic state of compound with mn magnetic moment of @xmath1 and v moment @xmath2 .",

    "examined the magnetic structure of mn@xmath0val by x - ray diffraction and magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "they found that mn@xmath0val was nearly half - metallic with the total magnetic moment of 1.94@xmath3 at 5 k. the curie temperature of the sample was found to be about 760 k and the loss of half - metallic character was attributed to the small amount of disorder .",
    "the electron structure calculation by ishida _",
    "performed within the local - density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory resulted in a ground state of mn@xmath0val close to half - metallicity @xcite . recently a detailed theoretical study of the magnetism of mn@xmath0val was reported by weht and pickett @xcite who used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange correlation potential and have shown that mn@xmath0val is a half - metallic ferrimagnet with the atomic moments of 1.5@xmath3 and -0.9@xmath3 on mn and v in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "the fermi level was found to lie in the minority spin band .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is a detailed study of the exchange interactions in two half - metallic mn@xmath0vz compounds : mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vge .",

    "both intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice exchange interactions are calculated .",
    "we show that the pattern of exchange interactions in these systems deviates from the physical picture that can be expected on the basis of the experimental information available .",
    "indeed , the mn - mn distance of 2.96(3.04 ) in mn@xmath0val ( mn@xmath0vge ) is substantially smaller than the mn - mn distance of about 4 in the x@xmath0mnz - type heusler alloys @xcite .",

    ", it is comparable with the mn - mn distance in the antiferromagnetic fcc mn ( 2.73 ) @xcite . according to the bethe - slater curve @xcite",
    "there are physical reasons to expect that smaller distances between the 3d atoms stimulate the formation of the antiferromagnetic structure whereas larger distances make the ferromagnetic structure energetically preferable . among the heusler alloys ,",
    "a smaller distance between pairs of the mn atoms is obtained in the case of random occupation by mn and z atoms of the y and z sublattices ( see , e.g. , the system with the b2-type crystal structure in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed",
    ", the experiment gives for such systems the antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "therefore in the case of mn@xmath0val an antiferromagnetism of the two mn sublattices can be expected .",
    "our study shows , however , that the situation is more complex . the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) mn  mn exchange interaction is found to be ferromagnetic whereas the next nn mn ",
    "mn interaction is antiferromagnetic . as a result",
    "the contributions of different mn atoms into the exchange field experienced by a given mn atom compensate strongly not giving substantial contribution into the curie temperature .",
    "the main role in the formation of the magnetic structure and the magnetic transition temperature is played by the strong mn  v exchange interaction .",
