    "extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) and intermediate mass - ratio inspirals ( imris ) , in which a stellar mass or a compact object with several tens solar masses inspirals into a more massive central black hole , have attracted much interest not only as a promising source of the gravitational waves ( gws ) for future spaceborne gw detectors , but also as a unique clean probe of the spacetime region of strong gravity . to achieve the test of general relativity using gws from e(i)mris , we need to predict sufficiently accurate waveforms .",
    "this requirement motivates us to model the e(i)mris as the motion of a small body in a given background spacetime with gravitational backreaction .",
    "this backreaction is treated as gravitational self - forces @xcite , and its higher - order extension with respect to the mass - ratio has attracted much interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "see the following review articles , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  refs . @xcite and references therein for more details .    in fact , following the scaling argument ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs.@xcite ) , the phase of gws from a particle whose orbital frequency sweeps a few orders of magnitude before the plunge can be expanded as @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath3 quantities independent of @xmath4 , which is the mass of a small particle , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and the spin parameter of the kerr black hole , respectively . on the one hand @xmath1 in eq .",
    ", we only need the self - forces up to the first - order time - averaged dissipative part .",
    "in addition , it has long been known that @xmath1 can be computed with the well - established balance argument , which relates the first - order time - averaged dissipative part of the self - forces to the energy and angular momentum fluxes associated with global killing vectors on the background kerr black hole@xcite .",
    "though the carter constant is not associated with any killing vector ( and thus the simple balance argument is not applicable ) , the way to computing long time averaged evolution of the carter constant has already been well established@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath2 , which is referred to as the dephasing relative to @xmath1 , depends on two different components of the self - forces : the first - order conservative part , and the averaged second - order dissipative part .",
    "the first subleading term , @xmath2 , can still be important , since potentially it may give a correction significantly greater than unity to the phase @xcite .    in the effort to obtain an accurate waveform ,",
    "there have been many works on self - forces . as for the first - order conservative part , thanks to recent massive development , we are now in part ready for practical computation with numerical implementation @xcite .",
    "particularly , in the case of the schwarzschild background , the corrections to the orbital frequencies@xcite and @xmath2@xcite have already been studied extensively . even in the case of the kerr background",
    "preliminary results of the self - forces in quasicircular orbits have been reported@xcite .    by contrast , the averaged second - order dissipative part of the self - forces has so far been studied only at the formal level in the context of black hole perturbation @xcite .",
    "it will require much more effort to establish the method for computing the second - order dissipative part , especially in the case of the kerr background . under such circumstances ,",
    "a typical strategy for evaluating @xmath2 is to make use of the standard post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation , in which we assume slow motion of a satellite and its weak gravitational field .",
    "based on the pn approximation , huerta and gair@xcite evaluated the size of the dephasing caused by the first - order conservative self - forces and the averaged second - order self - forces , picking up representative emris in quasicircular orbits on a kerr black hole .",
    "the same dephasing was also discussed by yunes  _ et al._@xcite , using the effective one - body formalism again for representative e(i)mris .",
    "a naive expectation is that the pn approximation will not suitable for modelling the waveforms of e(i)mris , especially for a kerr black hole with large spin .",
    "typical e(i)mris in circular orbits spend the last few years of inspiral in the vicinity of the inner most stable circular orbit ( isco ) . since the isco radius reaches the event horizon as the spin of the kerr black hole",
    "is increased to the extremal limit , the motion of the body becomes highly relativistic , exceeding the validity range of the standard pn approximation@xcite .",
    "however , things are not so trivial .",
    "the time spent near the isco becomes longer as we increase the mass ratio @xmath7 , but in that case the mass of the large central black hole also becomes larger .",
    "then , the total cycles of gws become smaller for a given observation time . as a result",
    ", the correction due to higher - order self - forces might be suppressed below the observational threshold , despite the loss of accuracy of the pn approximation .",
    "therefore , it is not so obvious whether there are really e(i)mris that require the notion of the second - order self - forces .",
    "the previous analyses mentioned above@xcite are focusing on the corrections coming from the self - forces at the currently available pn order and are limited to representative e(i)mris . to get an insight into",
    "whether or not the second - order self - forces based on the black hole perturbation are really necessary to calculate the waveforms of quasicircular e(i)mris , therefore , it would be useful to give an estimate of dephasing coming from the averaged second - order dissipative self - forces , focusing on the yet - unknown higher pn terms and surveying the whole parameter region of e(i)mris .",
    "what we discuss in this paper is the adiabatic evolution of e(i)mris in quasicircular orbits on a kerr spacetime . here",
    "the adiabatic evolution means an approximation in which the evolution of the orbital frequency is determined by the energy balance argument ; _",
    "i.e. _ , the rate of change of the total energy of the binary is equated to the energy flux emitted to infinity .    to evaluate the order of magnitude of the yet - unknown higher pn corrections , we need to rely on some extrapolation . for this purpose ,",
    "we first introduce a simple new resummation of the energy flux , which we call the `` exponential resummation . ''",
    "when the spin of a kerr black hole is large enough , the pn energy flux in the taylor form can be negative outside the isco radius for some pn orders@xcite .",
    "if this happens , the estimated total phase before the plunge diverges and the extrapolation to the higher pn order will not make sense .",
    "our simple `` exponential resummation '' is the one that ensures the positivity of the energy flux .    as a pn input for the corrections at the next leading order in the mass ratio , , instead of the usual mass ratio @xmath8 .",
    "we should note that the terms higher - order in the mass ratio arise even at the level of the quadrupole formula if we use another mass ratio . in this sense ,",
    "definitely the use of the symmetric mass ratio is advantageous .",
    "this fact has indeed been taken into account in the previous analyses such as that of le tiec  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the periastron advance due to the conservative portion of the first - order self - forces is compared to the result deduced from the numerical relativity . ]",
    "the best one available so far is the 3.5pn energy flux of gws@xcite with linear spin - dependent terms up to the 3 pn order , which has recently been derived by blanchet _",
    "et al._@xcite . to estimate the possible magnitude of the yet - unknown higher - order pn terms , we focus on a scaling property among the pn coefficients in the energy flux . using the 8 pn energy flux in the test particle limit @xcite",
    ", we will show that the absolute values of the coefficients scale roughly as required from the convergence of the pn series up to the light - ring radius .",
    "( this point was also discussed by nakano  _ et al .",
    "_ independently@xcite . ) since this scaling behavior is related to the pn convergence , despite the lack of the higher pn terms in the energy flux , we conjecture that the same scaling property will hold for the higher - order terms in the mass - ratio . under this assumption",
    ", we estimate the order of magnitude of the unknown portion of the energy flux coming from higher pn terms at the next leading order in the mass ratio via `` extrapolation . ''",
    "gathering the tools stated above , we will investigate the impact on the dephasing from the averaged dissipative second - order self - forces for various e(i)mris systematically .",
    "this is the main goal of this paper .",

    "since there is no reason to expect that the energy flux diverges outside the light - ring radius even if we take into account the finite mass corrections for quasicircular e(i)mris , we are motivated to assume that the ratio between the magnitude of the terms at @xmath162 and @xmath39 at the same pn order will roughly stay independent of the pn order .",
    "based on this assumption , we estimated the unknown portion of the energy flux that comes from the higher pn terms at the next leading order in the mass ratio and evaluated the residual dephasing due to them .",
    "we find that the residual dephasing may exceed one cycle for @xmath163 and spin of the kerr blackhole @xmath164 , assuming a 1 yr observation period .",
    "for some parameters , we found a little enhancement of the estimated dephasing at @xmath149 . since this enhancement is likely to be attributed to a mild accidental cancellation in the factor in the denominator of the estimator of the residual dephasing that we adopted , it might be fair to remove the bump that arises for this reason .",
    "then , the residual dephasing exceeds one cycle only for relatively large @xmath165 with @xmath164 . even for rather extreme case like @xmath166 ( the thorne limit ) ,",

    "the known part of the averaged dissipative second - order self - forces might be necessary even just for detection .",
    "moreover , when the parameter extraction from emris is concerned , even a small dephasing in principle gives a bias .",
    "hence , to what extent the higher - order corrections are needed crucially depends on the accuracies required by the physics that we wish to extract and also on the signal - to - noise ratio .    as a final remark",
    ", we should note that there is a possibility that we might be underestimating the residual dephasing by an order of magnitude , since the pn convergence is not very smooth , especially for positive large @xmath53 . even if our estimate turns out to be a good approximation of the real magnitude",
    ", we still have a chance to have a golden event with a large signal - to - noise ratio . in that case , one cycle or even one radian may not be a sufficient accuracy for the template waveforms .",
    "then , the dissipative part of the second - order self - forces that can not be captured by the pn expansion becomes necessary to extract the best physics from the observational data .",

    "hence , our analysis does not at all discourage the study on the averaged dissipative part of the second - order self - forces .",

    "this appendix is dedicated to finding the dephasing from the available pn terms in the next leading order in the mass ratio . in the bulk of our paper",
    ", we introduced three different types of pn flux formulas : taylor , exponential resummed and hybrid , but there is no qualitative difference among @xmath168}}}_{{{\\rm full } } } , { \\cal \\tilde l}^{{{\\rm t}}{{[1]}}}_{n\\rm pn}]$ ] , @xmath169}}}_{{{\\rm full } } } , { \\cal \\tilde l}^{{{\\rm exp}}{{[1]}}}_{n\\rm pn}]$ ] and @xmath169}}}_{{{\\rm full}}},{\\cal \\tilde l}^{{{\\rm hyb}}{{[1]}}}_{n\\rm pn}]$ ] , as long as we choose the exact numerical flux @xmath37}}}_{{{\\rm full}}}$ ] as the reference flux .",
    "this is because the significant difference among various fluxes appears only in the higher pn residual parts , such as those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : n - pn ] .",
    "therefore , we show only @xmath169}}}_{{{\\rm full}}},{\\cal \\tilde l}^{{{\\rm hyb}}{{[1]}}}_{3\\rm pn}]$ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary - q ] .",
    "we stress that what we show is the dephasing caused by the terms not at the 3 pn order but up to the 3pn order .",
    "the main message of fig .",
    "[ fig : vary - q ] is that the corrections to the phase of gws due to the higher - order terms in the mass ratio are suppressed below 1 rad , even if we include the leading order of the pn expansion- for a binary with @xmath170 , say , when the mass of the central kerr black hole is greater than @xmath171 with the satellite mass fixed to 10@xmath172 .",
    "this holds irrespective of the value of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath53 .",
    "this plot clearly denies the naive statement that the effects of higher pn corrections should be important for a more massive central black hole because the satellite stays near the isco for a longer period .",
    "--3pt    as for results in the literature for comparison , for a binary with @xmath173 and @xmath174 , heurte and gair@xcite reported 1.5 rad dephasing after the last 1 yr of inspiral based on the 2 pn taylor flux , while yunes  _ et al._@xcite reported 0.71  rad dephasing after the last 11.5 months of inspiral for the same binary parameters . following our definition of the dephasing , we calculate @xmath169}}}_{{{\\rm full}}},{\\cal \\tilde   l}^{{{\\rm hyb}}{{[1]}}}_{2\\rm pn}]$ ] to find 1.46 rad , which we think is in good agreement with the previous results , within the variance due to the different definition of dephasing .",
    "in the bulk of our manuscript , we neglected the flux absorbed by the horizon . in the test particle limit ,",
    "et al._@xcite and yunes _",
    "et al._@xcite have already shown that the energy flux absorbed through the horizon can not be neglected , leading to a large dephasing , especially when the kerr black hole has large spin . however",
    ", this does not mean that the corrections due to the horizon absorption flux at the next leading order in the mass ratio are also important .",
    "naively , the standard pn formalism is not suitable for calculating the horizon absorption flux since the black hole horizon is beyond the reach of the standard pn expansion , although there is a direction to evaluate the horizon absorption flux by relating it with the tidal field around each black hole@xcite .    in this appendix",
    ", we briefly address the dephasing caused by the flux absorbed through the horizon in the test particle limit to see what can be said about the dephasing due to the horizon absorption flux at the next leading order in the mass ratio . the flux absorbed through the horizon in the test particle limit",
    "is expanded as@xcite @xmath175}_{{n\\rm pn}}(x ) & : = & \\frac{32}{5}\\nu^2 x^5   \\left\\ { \\left(- \\frac{1}{4}q - \\frac{3}{4}q^3    \\right)x^{5/2 }   + \\left(- q - \\frac{33}{16 } q^3    \\right)x^{7/2 }   + o(x^{4 } )   \\right\\}~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the exact numerical flux is also calculable@xcite .",
    "we denote the contribution from the first term in the curly brackets in the above expression by @xmath176}_{2.5\\rm pn}$ ] and the remaining part of the horizon flux by @xmath176}_{>2.5\\rm pn}$ ] , in a similar manner as before .",
    "as we mentioned above , the horizon absorption flux at the next leading order in the mass ratio is still under development , but the part that requires the second - order metric perturbation should start with 1 pn order higher than the leading terms in the test particle limit , starting at the 3.5pn order .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath176}_{>2.5\\rm pn}$ ] , excluding @xmath176}_{2.5\\rm pn}$ ] , as the counterpart of the unknown horizon absorption flux at the next leading order in the mass ratio . under this consideration , we compare the dephasing due to the horizon absorption flux @xmath177}_{{{\\rm full}}}+{\\cal l}^{[0,\\rm h]}_{2.5\\rm pn } , { \\cal l}^{[0,\\rm h]}_{>2.5\\rm pn}]\\ ] ] to that coming from the pn truncation @xmath178}}}_{n\\rm pn } , { \\cal l}^{{{\\rm exp}}{{[0]}}}_{>n\\rm pn}]$ ] for @xmath145 or @xmath146 in the test particle limit .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] for @xmath138 .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] indicates that @xmath179}_{{{\\rm full}}}+{\\cal l}^{[0,\\rm h]}_{2.5\\rm pn } , { \\cal l}^{[0,\\rm h]}_{>2.5\\rm pn}]$ ] stays , at most , @xmath180 rad for the entire e(i)mri parameter region .",
    "indeed , it is , at most , about @xmath181 of @xmath136}}}_{n\\rm pn } , { \\cal l}^{{{\\rm exp}}{{[0]}}}_{>n\\rm pn}]$ ] . for large @xmath53",
    ", the smallness of the effect of the horizon flux relative to the higher - order pn corrections can be understood from the work by hughes@xcite , who numerically found that the energy flux absorbed by a kerr black hole is , at best , ten times smaller than that emitted to infinity , with the aid of the fact that the pn expansion shows a poor convergence near the isco for large @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we expect that the residual dephasing due to the horizon absorption flux will be minor compared with the higher pn flux to infinity , and also in the next leading order in the mass ratio .",
