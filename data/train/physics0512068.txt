    "modeling and simulations enable one to understand and explain the observable phenomena and predict the new ones .",
    "this is true , as well , for the mathematical study and modeling of the traffic flow with the aim to get a better understanding of phenomena and avoid some problems of traffic congestion .",
    "traffic phenomena are complex and nonlinear , they show cluster formation , huge fluctuations and long - range dependencies .",
    "almost forty years ago from the empirical data it was detected that fluctuations of a traffic current on a expressway obey the @xmath2 law for low spectral frequencies @xcite .",
    "similarly @xmath2 noise is observable in the flows of granular materials @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 noise , or @xmath2 fluctuations are usually related with the power - law distributions of other statistics of the fluctuating signals , first of all with the power - law decay of autocorrelations and the long - memory processes ( see , e.g. , comprehensive bibliography of @xmath2 noise in the website @xcite , review articles @xcite and references in the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of the clustering and large fluctuations in the traffic and granular flows may be a result of synchronization of the nonlinear systems with stopping and driven by common noise , resulting in the nonchaotic behavior of the brownian - type motions , intermittency and @xmath2 noise @xcite .",
    "the traffic and granular flows usually may be considered as those consisting of the discrete identical objects such as vehicles , pedestrians , granules , packets and so on , they may be represented as consisting of pulses or elementary events and further simplified to the point process model @xcite . moreover , from the modeling of the traffic it was found that @xmath2 noise may be the result of clustering and jumping @xcite similar to the point process model of @xmath2 noise @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath2 noise may be conditioned by the flow consisting of uncorrelated pulses of variable size with the power - law distribution of the pulse durations @xcite . in the internet traffic",
    "the flow of the signals primarily is composed of the power - law distributed file sizes .",
    "the files are divided by the network protocol into the equal packets @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total incoming web traffic is a sequence of the packets arising from large number of requests .",
    "such a flow exhibits @xmath2 fluctuations , as well @xcite .",
    "the long - range correlations and the power - law fluctuations in the wide range of the time scale from minutes to months of the expressway traffic flow have recently been observed and investigated using the method of the detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite .",
    "there are no explanations why the traffic flow exhibit @xmath2 noise behavior in such a large interval of the time .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present analytical and numerical results for the modeling of flows represented as sequences of different pulses and as a correlated non - poissonian point process resulting in @xmath2 noise and to apply these results to the modeling of the internet traffic .",
    "we will investigate a signal of flow consisting of a sequence of pulses , @xmath3 here the function @xmath4 represents the shape of the @xmath5 pulse having influence on the signal @xmath6 in the region of time @xmath7 .",
    "the power spectral density of the signal can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the observation time and the brackets @xmath11 denote the averaging over realizations of the process .",
    "we assume that pulse shape functions @xmath12 decrease sufficiently fast when @xmath13 . since @xmath14 , the bounds of the integration in eq .",
    "can be changed to @xmath15 .",
    "when the time moments @xmath7 are not correlated with the shape of the pulse @xmath16 , the power spectrum is @xcite @xmath17    after introduction of the functions @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 the spectrum can be written as @xmath20      equation can be further simplified for the stationary process . then all averages can depend only on @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 equation then reads @xmath24 introducing a new variable @xmath25 and changing the order of summation , yield @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are minimal and maximal values of the index @xmath5 in the interval of observation @xmath29 . eq .",
    "may be simplified to the structure @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean number of pulses per unit time and @xmath32 is the number of pulses in the time interval @xmath29 .",
    "if the sum @xmath33 when @xmath14 , then the second term in the sum vanishes and the spectrum is @xmath34      when the shape of the pulses is fixed ( @xmath5-independent ) then the function @xmath35 does not depend on @xmath5 and @xmath36 and , therefore , @xmath37",
    ". then equation yields the power spectrum @xmath38 eq",
    ".   represents the spectrum of the process as a composition of the spectrum of one pulse , @xmath39 and the power density spectrum @xmath40 of the point process @xmath41 with the area of the pulse @xmath42 .",
    "the shapes of the pulses mainly influence the high frequency power spectral density , i.e. , at @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the characteristic pulse length .",
    "therefore the power spectral density at low frequencies for the not very long pulses is mainly conditioned by the correlations between the transit times @xmath7 , i.e. , the signal may be approximated by the point process .",
    "the point process model of @xmath45 noise has been proposed @xcite , generalized @xcite , analysed and used for the financial systems @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that when the average interpulse , interevent , interarrival , recurrence or waiting times @xmath46 of the signal diffuse in some interval , the power spectrum of such process may exhibit the power - law dependence , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "the distribution density of the signal intensity defined as @xmath49 may be of the power - law , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , as well .",
    "the exponents @xmath52 and @xmath53 are depending on the manner of diffusion - like motion of the interevent time @xmath54 and , e.g. , for the multiplicative process are interrelated @xcite . for the pure multiplicative process @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the exponent of the power - law distribution , @xmath57 , of the interevent time .",
    "in general , for relatively slow fluctuations of @xmath54 , the distribution density of the flow @xmath58 , @xmath59 is mostly conditioned by the multiplier @xmath60 .",
    "as far as the point process model has recently @xcite been analysed rather properly here we will not repeat the analysis and only present some new illustrations .    , ( a ) , of the flow @xmath6 , ( b ) , and of the power spectra @xmath61 , ( c ) , for different point processes with the slow diffusion - like motion of the average interevent time .",
    "different symbols correspond to different types of the generation of the interevent sequences.,title=\"fig : \" ] , ( a ) , of the flow @xmath6 , ( b ) , and of the power spectra @xmath61 , ( c ) , for different point processes with the slow diffusion - like motion of the average interevent time .",
    "different symbols correspond to different types of the generation of the interevent sequences.,title=\"fig : \" ] , ( a ) , of the flow @xmath6 , ( b ) , and of the power spectra @xmath61 , ( c ) , for different point processes with the slow diffusion - like motion of the average interevent time .",
    "different symbols correspond to different types of the generation of the interevent sequences.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ spp : dist ] demonstrates that for essentially different distributions of @xmath54 , the power spectra and distribution densities of the point processes are similar .",
    "further we proceed to the flow consisting of the pulses of different durations and application of this approach for modeling of the internet traffic .",
    "when the occurrence times @xmath7 of the pulses are uncorrelated and distributed according to the poisson process , the power spectrum of the random pulse train is given by the carlson s theorem @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fourier transform of the pulse @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that the random parameters of the pulses are the duration and the area ( integral ) of the pulse .",
    "we can take the form of the pulses as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the characteristic duration of the pulse .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath66 corresponds to the fixed height but different durations , the telegraph - like pulses , whereas @xmath67 corresponds to constant area pulses but of different heights and durations , and so on .    for the power - law distribution of the pulse durations ,",
    "@xmath68 from eqs .",
    "and we have the spectrum @xmath69 for @xmath70 when @xmath71 the expression may be approximated as @xmath72 therefore , the random pulses with the appropriate distribution of the pulse duration ( and area ) may generate signals with the power - law distribution of the spectrum with different slopes .",
    "so , the pure @xmath2 noise generates , e.g. , the fixed area ( @xmath67 ) with the uniform distribution of the durations ( @xmath73 ) sequences of pulses , the fixed height ( @xmath66 ) with the uniform distribution of the inverse durations @xmath74 and all other sequences of random pulses satisfying the condition @xmath75 .",
    "in such a case from eq .",
    "we have @xmath76",
    "in this section we will apply the results of the section [ sec : flow ] for modeling the internet traffic .",
    "the incoming traffic consists of sequence of packets , which are the result of the division of the requested files by the network ( tcp ) protocol .",
    "maximum size of the packet is @xmath77 bytes .",
    "therefore , the information signal is as the point process with the pulse area @xmath78 bytes .",
    "further , we will analyse the flow of the packets and will measure the intensity of the flow in packets per second .",
    "in such a system of units in eq .",
    "we should put @xmath42 .",
    "we exploit the empirical observation @xcite that the distribution of the file sizes @xmath79 may be described by the positive cauchy distribution @xmath80 with the empirical parameter @xmath81 bytes .",
    "this distribution asymptotically exhibits the pareto distribution and follows the zipf s law @xmath82 .",
    "the files are divided by the network protocol into packets of the maximum size of @xmath77 bytes or less . in the internet traffic the packets spread into the poissonian sequence with the average inter - packet time @xmath83 ( see fig .  [",
    "tit : packets ] ) .",
    "the total incoming flow of the packets to the server consists of the packets arising from the poissonian request of the files with the average interarrival time of files @xmath84 .",
    "the files are requested from different servers located at different distance .",
    "this results in the distribution of the average inter - packet time @xmath83 in some interval . for reproduction of the empirical distribution of the interpacket time",
    "@xmath54 we assume the uniform distribution of @xmath85 in some interval @xmath86 $ ] , similarly to the mcwhorter model of @xmath87 noise @xcite . as a result , the presented model reproduces sufficiently well the observable non - poissonian distribution of the arrival interpacket times and the power spectral density , as well ( see fig .  [",
    "tit : dist ] ) .",
    "in the paper it was shown that the processes exhibiting @xmath2 noise and the power - law distribution of the intensity may be generated starting from the signals as sequences of constant area pulses with the correlated appearance times as well as of different size poissonian pulses .",
    "combination of both approaches enables the modeling of the signals in the internet traffic .    , ( a ) , and the power spectra , ( b ) , for the simulated point process ( open circles ) and the empirical data ( open squares ) .",
