    "measuring accurate masses for the most massive stars in our galaxy and beyond is important for constraining star formation and stellar evolution theories , which have indirect implications for many objects that are not well understood , such as supernovae , gamma - ray bursts and population iii stars . some of the most massive candidates in the milky way are lbv 1806 - 20 @xcite , the pistol star @xcite , and @xmath2 carinae @xcite , which have inferred masses up to @xmath3",
    "however , the masses of these stars are only indirect estimates and thus have large uncertainties associated with them .",
    "the only direct way of measuring accurate masses of distant stars is in eclipsing binaries .    until recently ,",
    "the most massive stars ever weighed in binaries were : r136 - 38 ( o3v+o6v ) in the lmc with a primary mass of @xmath4 @xcite , wr 22 ( wn7+abs@xmath5o ) , with a minimum primary mass of @xmath6 @xcite and plaskett s star with a minimum primary mass of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we present the light curve for wr  20a , the most massive binary measured accurately , and propose to measure fundamental parameters of similar massive binaries in the local group .",
    "the current champion of the most massive star competition is wr  20a , a wolf - rayet ( wr ) binary in the compact cluster westerlund  2 , which is located at the center of the hii region rcw 49 .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopy for wr  20a and measured extremely large minimum masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the components .",
    "the final masses strongly depend on both the period and inclination of the binary , which can only be measured from the light curve . in may 2004",
    ", @xcite obtained 83 @xmath10band observations of wr  20a with the ogle team s 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institute of washington .",
    "the first goal of our observations was to confirm the @xmath11 day spectroscopic period of the wr  20a binary and refine its value to @xmath12 days , thus confirming the remarkable masses of its components .",
    "next , we derived an inclination angle @xmath13 for the system from our well - sampled light curve .",
    "we fit the curve with the wilson - devinney ( wd ) code @xcite for modeling distorted stars and derived a best fit inclination angle of @xmath14 . in figure",
    "[ lc ] we show the result of the @xmath10band light curve model fit for wr  20a .",
    "the uneven eclipse depths suggest slightly different effective temperatures and , thus , different spectral types for the components .",
    "armed with the refined period and the exact value of the inclination angle , we re - analyzed the radial velocity data of @xcite .",
    "fixing the eccentricity to @xmath15 , as the light curve confirms , and the period to @xmath12 days , we fit the radial velocity data applying equal weights and rejecting points with radial velocity measurements smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "we derive slightly larger velocity semi - amplitudes than @xcite , which in turn yield larger minimum masses and final masses of the components of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the direct project ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has found @xmath19 variables in each of the galaxies m31 and m33 , which include about 100 eclipsing binary systems .",
    "follow up photometry was done with the 2.1 m kpno telescope in 1999 and 2001 on the best system , m33a , and the light curve is shown on the left panel of figure  [ deb ] ( a.z .",
    "bonanos et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have obtained spectra with esi on keck ii in november 2002 and september 2003 and the radial velocity curve is shown on the right panel of figure  [ deb ] .",
    "analogs of wr  20a , possibly with even higher mass components , are bound to exist in m31 and m33 .",
    "we have selected the brightest eclipsing binaries as massive binary candidates and plan to obtain spectroscopy to derive their radial velocity curves and , hence , masses .",
    "in addition to measuring their fundamental parameters , we will obtain a direct distance estimate .",
    "the advantage of studying eclipsing binaries in these galaxies would be their well known distances and low reddening ."
