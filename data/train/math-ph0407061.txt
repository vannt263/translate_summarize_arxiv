    "it has recently been observed that the density profiles of a supernova explosion and an inertial confinement plasma implosion@xcite are strikingly similar . an empirical basis for this intriguing duality between explosion and implosion",
    "was given by drury and mendona @xcite who pointed out that euler s equations of fluid dynamics , which describe both the systems , are form ",
    "invariant under a set of nonlinear coordinate transformations _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath3 .",
    "the minus sign in the time transformation maps an explosion to an implosion and the inversion allows large time scales to be mapped to small time scales and _ vice versa_. these transformations suggest that the maximal kinematical invariance group @xmath4 of fluid dynamics is larger than the standard galilei group . it is now known that this larger group is a twelve - parameter semidirect product , @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the nine - parameter , connected , static galilei group : @xmath6 and @xmath0 is the group consisting of the transformations : @xmath7 physically , the three - parameter @xmath0 group consists of time translations , scale transformations , and a one - parameter set of time - dependent scale transformations called expansions .",
    "the transformations proposed by drury and mendona are a special case of the @xmath2 transformations with @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath0 part of @xmath9 is therefore important for a better understanding of the explosion  implosion map .",
    "it should be pointed out that the naive expectation of using time - reversal invariance , to explain the similarity between explosion and implosion , is untenable here since the length and time scales involved in the two systems are drastically different .",
    "invoking scaling arguments is not of much help since , although a composition of time - reversal and suitable scalings leaves the equations of fluid mechanics and the reynolds number invariant , it has the property of reversing the direction of time s arrow and thereby violates the second law of thermodynamics . as a consequence ,",
    "when applied to a shock wave , such transformations violate entropy conditions that define the physicality of the shock .",
    "as is well - known , however , both the supernova explosion and the plasma implosion are driven by the formation and propagation of a shock wave .",
    "it is therefore important to examine whether the @xmath2 symmetry , that purports to explain the observed duality , respects the physicality of the shock wave . with this in view , we extend the study of @xcite  in which the explanation of explosion - implosion duality based on the symmetry group @xmath9 was restricted to smooth , subsonic flows  to examine shock waves .",
    "it will be shown that shock wave solutions are consistent with the symmetries of the maximal kinematical invariance group @xmath9 in the following precise sense .",
    "a shock in a fluid is described mathematically by the well - known rankine - hugoniot jump conditions @xcite .",
    "so the natural question to ask is : what happens to these conditions under the action of the @xmath2 group ?",
    "this question is best answered not in the framework of the partial differential equations of fluid dynamics , but by reverting back to their so - called primitive form _ i.e. _ expressing them as conservation laws .",
    "the conservation laws are completely equivalent to the partial differential equations for smooth flows , but produce the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for discontinuous flows in a natural and well - defined manner .",
    "the connection with @xmath2 is made by appealing to noether s theorem which asserts that corresponding to every continuous symmetry , there exists a conserved charge .",
    "anticipating that the @xmath0 transformations will mix the conservation laws corresponding to various symmetries , we construct the noether charges corresponding to them and the boost transformations , in addition to the well - known ones for rotations , space and time translations .",
    "we then use the attendant conservation laws to establish a new set of jump conditions .",
    "it turns out that the new conditions are identically satisfied if the standard conditions for mass , momentum and energy conservation are satisfied .",
    "although seemingly redundant because of this reason , the new set holds independently ; following , as it does , from the symmetries of the fluid equations .",
    "in fact , these conditions are useful to prove the form - invariance of the rankine - hugoniot conditions under the @xmath0 transformations .",
    "thus , to each physical system governed by the fluid dynamics equations two independent , but physically equivalent , sets of jump conditions can be associated , the two being related by @xmath0 transformations .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 transformations map the rankine - hugoniot conditions of the explosion to the dual rankine - hugoniot conditions of the implosion and _ vice versa_. further , by specialising to the drury - mendona transformations , @xmath10 , we show that the jump conditions for boosts and expansions , along with the continuity equation for mass conservation , provide an independent , albeit equivalent , description of the shock .",
    "they may be viewed either as the dual of the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions , or , in the language of passive coordinate transformations , as the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions in the dual coordinate system corresponding to the choice @xmath11 .",
    "similar dual conditions exist for each choice of the @xmath2 parameters .",
    "it is well - known that rankine - hugoniot conditions describe not only shocks , but other discontinuities like slip and contact discontinuities , for example .",
    "therefore , the map between the dual sets of rankine - hugoniot conditions would be relevant to explosion - implosion duality only if both the sets refer to shocks .",
    "in other words , only those rankine - hugoniot conditions that describe a shock and only those @xmath2 transformations which map a shock to a shock are of interest for explosion - implosion duality . moreover , rankine - hugoniot conditions say nothing about the physicality of the shock  this information is contained in additional inequalities for its entropy that the shock needs to satisfy .",
    "physical shocks are distinguished from others because their entropy always increases across the shock front .",
    "we verify explicitly that this requirement is unaffected by the @xmath2 transformations .",
    "the physicality of the map between explosion and implosion may also be established in the following subtle manner : although the notions of viscosity and heat conduction lose their meaning in the immediate vicinity of the shock , because the changes in all the quantities they depend on are so great , they do play an important role in the formation and maintenance of a shock discontinuity@xcite .",
    "in particular , the positivity of the coefficients of viscosity and heat conduction guarantees that the shock satisfies the appropriate entropy conditions@xcite . hence , euler s equations ought to be considered as a special case of a more general set of fluid equations with vanishingly small viscosity . requiring the sign of the viscosity to remain unchanged under the transformations",
    "establishes the physicality .",
    "the navier - stokes equations  which are the obvious choice for including viscosity  are not invariant under the full @xmath0 part of @xmath9 , but only under the standard galilean transformations .",
    "however , a more general set of fluid equations with viscosity fields transforming appropriately under the @xmath2 transformations has a maximal kinematical invariance group given by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "hence we use these equations for our purpose of examining the behaviour of non  vanishing viscosity under the @xmath2 transformations .",
    "similar arguments apply for heat conduction , but it does not bring in any new qualitative features and hence is omitted from further discussion .",
    "in this section we briefly recapitulate the results of @xcite .",
    "the general fluid equations in @xmath12-dimensional space are @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the above equations @xmath16 stand for the density , velocity , pressure and energy density of the fluid respectively and @xmath17 are the bulk and shear viscosity fields .",
    "the above differential equations are usually augmented by an algebraic condition called the polytropic equation of state which relates the pressure to the energy density as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant called the polytropic exponent . as shown in @xcite , the maximal invariance group of the above set of equations",
    "is @xmath20 , provided the polytropic exponent takes the standard value for an ideal , nonrelativistic fluid _ viz . _ @xmath21 . for this value , the fluid equations are invariant under the following transformations @xcite :      let @xmath22 denote a general element of this sub - group then @xmath23 with @xmath24 an orthogonal matrix . under the action of @xmath22 ,",
    "the fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 transform as @xmath27      let @xmath28 denote a general element of the @xmath0 part of @xmath4 then @xmath29 under the action of @xmath28 , the fields transform as @xmath30 for both @xmath22 and @xmath28 , the transformations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be worked out once the transformation properties of @xmath25 are known since @xmath33 with the field @xmath34  related to entropy  transforming like a scalar .",
    "the transformation properties of the viscosity fields are similar to the density @xmath25 @xmath35 the above results were derived in @xcite by requiring the invariance of the action for the simple case of an inviscid and isentropic fluid .",
    "the symmetry of the equations followed by subsequently relaxing the simplifications to arrive at the general fluid equations .",
    "it should be noted that the requirement of the invariance of the action is sufficient , but not necessary , for the form invariance of the equations that follow from it .",
    "any transformation that leaves the action invariant upto a multiplicative factor produces equations of motion which have the same form .",
    "if this is taken into account , the condition @xmath36 is no longer required and @xmath2 gets replaced by @xmath37 in the maximal invariance group of the general fluid equations .",
    "however , it is sufficient for our purposes to concentrate on the variational symmetries of the fluid equations and for this purpose , @xmath5 . finally , for the sake of completeness",
    ", it should also be pointed out that the @xmath0 condition is invariant under the following discrete symmetries @xmath38 of the @xmath0 parameters .",
    "in this section we construct the conservation laws corresponding to the symmetries outlined in the previous section . in order to do this ,",
    "it is useful to revert back to the action formalism and obtain the results for the subclass of inviscid , isentropic and irrotational flows .",
    "the corresponding expressions for a general fluid can then be worked out along the lines of  @xcite .    for inviscid , isentropic and irrotational flows ,",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the curl - free part of the velocity vector field @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be a four - vector under the transformations of the previous section _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 with @xmath44 are the components of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "let the infinitesimal variations in the coordinates and fields be defined as @xmath47 then the variations for translations , rotations , boosts , dilatations , and expansions respectively are given by @xmath48 where the parameters @xmath49 are expressible in terms of the @xmath0 parameters @xmath50 .",
    "the field variation is given by @xmath51 ^ 2\\over 2\\gamma(\\gamma t   + \\delta ) } \\ ] ] the variation in @xmath25 is not important since no derivatives of @xmath25 appear in the lagrangian density . using these results we find , by a straightforward application of noether s theorem @xcite , that the following quantities , integrated over all space , are constants of motion : @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 the conditions of irrotationality and isentropicity can be relaxed easily and one sees that euler s equations @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 can be expressed in the form of conservation laws , @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63\\ ] ] for mass and the translation generators found above .",
    "these can be reexpressed succinctly as follows : @xmath64 the zeroeth components of the above currents , namely @xmath25 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , give the charge densities which , when integrated over all space , give the conserved charges . as is well - known , these are merely statements of mass , momentum flux , and total energy conservation .",
    "the corresponding current densities are @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 the conservation laws corresponding to rotations , boosts , dilatations and expansions can be stated similarly @xmath70 the charge densities are shown in ( 19 ) -(22 ) respectively , and the corresponding currents are @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 it may be mentioned that the above results are not surprising in the light of @xcite , where corresponding results for a free , nonrelativistic , point particle were obtained through a discussion that essentially parallels the above .",
    "the noteworthy linear relations between the currents will , however , play a crucial role in this paper when we consider flows with discontinuities .",
    "as long as the flows are smooth , _",
    "i.e. _ the functions @xmath75 in their dependence on @xmath45 and @xmath76 , the systems ( 23  25 ) and ( 26  28 ) are equivalent",
    ". however , real flows are not always smooth and can develop discontinuities as time elapses .",
    "such flows are described by weak solutions of differential equations @xcite .",
    "a weak solution is generally piecewise smooth .",
    "the smooth parts satisfy the differential equation in the usual , or strong , form , but that does not generally suffice to determine the course of motion for initial data , and the equation must be supplemented by jump conditions .",
    "the resulting jump conditions are most clearly derived from the conservation laws .    by definition any ,",
    "possibly non - smooth , function @xmath77 that satisfies @xmath78 for all test functions @xmath79 is said to be a weak solution of the differential equation @xmath80 .",
    "we now use the above definition to obtain the jump conditions associated with the system of conservation laws derived in the last section .",
    "suppose @xmath81 has a jump discontinuity across a hyper - surface @xmath82 in @xmath83 space , while otherwise being continuously differentiable in some neighbourhood @xmath84 of @xmath82 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath85 be a test function with support in @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the part of the support of @xmath85 that lies on _ one side _ of @xmath82 , say the right .",
    "then , by gauss s theorem @xmath87 since @xmath88 on the boundary of @xmath86 except on @xmath82 .",
    "the second integral in the above equation is zero , because the conservation law holds in the strong sense in the interior of @xmath86 . here",
    ", @xmath89 is the outward normal vector to the hypersurface @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , if we integrate similarly over the left part of the support of @xmath90 , add the result and make use of ( [ weak ] ) , we find that : @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the difference of the two limiting values of a function @xmath93 on the two sides of the hypersurface @xmath82 _ i.e. _ the jump of the function .",
    "this result follows because the vector @xmath94 , which by convention points outwards , flips its sign on the left side of the support .",
    "since @xmath90 is an arbitrary test function , the above equation implies the jump condition @xmath95 applying ( [ master ] ) to the conservation laws ( 29 ) for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 from here the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions can be derived in their usual form @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can apply ( [ master ] ) to the conservation laws ( 33 ) for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 to obtain a new set of jump conditions : @xmath104 since the coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath76 are continuous on @xmath82 , these conditions are all identically satisfied because of the jump conditions for mass , momentum and energy conservation , in ( 42 - 44 )  a fact that can be easily verified using ( 19 - 22 ) and ( 34 - 37 ) .",
    "we have seen that the new set of jump conditions associated with rotations , boosts , dilatations , and expansions , follow from the jump conditions associated with mass , momentum and energy .",
    "this suggests that the rankine - hugoniot conditions are invariant under the full kinematical invariance group of smooth flows , including the @xmath0 part .    to see this explicitly , we consider the transformation properties of the conserved currents under @xmath0 .",
    "let us begin by considering the simplest of these , namely the time - component of @xmath105 . from equation ( 10 ) ,",
    "now with @xmath106 , @xmath107 the @xmath108 factor is cancelled by an identical factor coming from the change of variables when we perform an integration over all space .",
    "moreover , the transformation does not mix @xmath25 with any other current .",
    "thus , @xmath25 transforms under the singlet representation of @xmath2 as a scalar density .",
    "let us now consider the transformation of the time - component of @xmath109 . from ( 10 )",
    "it now follows , after a little algebra , that @xmath110 thus the transformation of the spatial translation generator mixes it with the boost generator together with which , it forms a doublet representation of @xmath2 , with the prefactor @xmath108 now making it a vector density .",
    "the latter fact is , in fact , generic to the time - components of all the currents .",
    "likewise , we may consider the generator of time translations , namely the hamiltonian , and it follows that @xmath111 thus the transformation of the time translation generator mixes it with the generator of dilatations and expansions , the three of them form the triplet ( or adjoint ) representation .",
    "the transformation properties of the rest of the currents can be similarly worked out and the results summarised as follows : if the ( abstract ) symmetry generators @xmath112 transform as @xmath113 where the matrix @xmath114 is determined by the group structure of @xmath115 , then the corresponding currents transform as @xmath116 assembling the currents in a column , @xmath117 one has for the transformation matrix , @xmath118 using @xmath119 , and the fact that the determinant of a block diagonal matrix is the product of the determinants of the blocks , it is easy to check that the matrix @xmath120 has unit determinant . as already pointed out , the fact that the currents transform like vector densities is reflected in the temporal components picking up a multiplicative factor @xmath108 .",
    "the spatial components follow the example @xmath121 with the same @xmath2 transformations defined by the matrix @xmath120 .",
    "the dual rankine - hugoniot conditions are now easily obtained .",
    "the normal vector @xmath94 appearing in the jump condition ( [ master ] ) transforms like a covector , @xmath122 so the transformed jump condition for @xmath123 is @xmath124 since the determinant is smooth across the surface @xmath82 , the factor in front of the sum can be omitted .",
    "the transformed jump condition is therefore a linear combination of the original jump conditions .",
    "in particular , the conditions for @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( the rankine - hugoniot conditions ) become linear combinations of the jump conditions for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath128 , @xmath127 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions ( 42 - 44 ) , in conjunction with the new set of jump conditions ( 45 - 48 ) , then imply that the right hand side of the above equations is identically zero _",
    "i.e. _ the rankine - hugoniot conditions are form  invariant .",
    "in particular , this holds for the drury - mendona transformation @xmath132 , @xmath133 used to relate the explosion and implosion problems . for this , @xmath134 and it follows that @xmath135 where we have substituted the explicit expressions for the currents @xmath136 and @xmath103 .",
    "the conditions ( 62 - 24 ) are the dual rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "if an explosion is described by the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions , the corresponding implosion , obtained by a drury - mendona transformation , is described by the dual rankine - hugoniot conditions ( 62 - 64 ) .",
    "since the coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath76 are continuous on @xmath82 , and crucially because the relations between the currents are linear , the conditions ( 62 - 64 ) are equivalent to the jump conditions obtained from mass , momentum and energy conservation , in ( 42 - 44 ) . in fact , these two sets of equations imply , and are implied by , each other . in conclusion ,",
    "the dual set of jump conditions associated with mass , boosts and expansions , is completely equivalent to the usual rankine - hugoniot conditions and may be used for an independent description of the shock .",
    "for a polytropic gas , by choosing @xmath137 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 5 ) as @xmath138 in @xcite we defined an isentropic flow to be one for which @xmath139 . for a general flow",
    ", it followed that @xmath34 transforms like a scalar . for a polytropic gas , it is also well - known @xcite that @xmath34 is related to the specific entropy ( entropy per unit mass ) , @xmath140 as follows : @xmath141\\ ] ] where @xmath142 , @xmath143 being the universal gas constant divided by the molecular weight of the particular gas , @xmath144 the volume and @xmath145 an appropriate constant .",
    "it is obvious from this equation that as a particle of the medium moves about , the specific entropy at the moving particle remains constant under an @xmath2 transformation .",
    "hence , under an @xmath2 transformation , a physical shock gets mapped to a physical shock .",
    "we now require the positivity of viscosity to be preserved under an @xmath2 transformation  a requirement that guarantees that the shock respects the entropy condition . as already pointed out ( see eq .",
    "( 12 ) ) , in three - dimensional space , the viscosity fields transform as follows : @xmath146 thus the transformation properties of the viscosity fields are similar to @xmath25 _ i.e. , _ they transform like scalar densities . hence , if we integrate the viscosity field over all space , to get the viscosity , it is an invariant under the @xmath2 transformations .",
    "likewise , the specific viscosity ( viscosity per unit mass ) , is an invariant .",
    "it follows that the positivity of the viscosity is maintained without any additional restrictions on the @xmath2 parameters .",
    "in this paper , we extended the analysis of @xcite to discuss the symmetries of discontinuous flows in fluid dynamics .",
    "the maximal kinematical invariance group of an ideal , polytropic fluid is @xmath147 , not just for smooth , but for discontinuous flows also .",
    "this is made manifest by writing the fluid equations in their conservation law form .",
    "new conservation laws follow from a direct application of noether s theorem , enabling us to construct a dual set of rankine - hugoniot shock conditions .",
    "the @xmath2 transformations map the standard rankine - hugoniot shock conditions to the dual ones and _ vice versa_. these transformations also respect the entropy conditions that physical shocks need to satisfy . hence we conclude that , under these transformations , an explosion gets mapped to an implosion , thus offering a theoretical explanation for the intriguing observations of @xcite .",
