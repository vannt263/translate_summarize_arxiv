    "when an ion hits a surface liberates locally a large amount of energy that melts a region of the solid immediately below . for geometrical reasons ,",
    "the sputtering effect depends on the surface - curvature : the energy concentrates on regions of positive curvature and this favorites the excavation of valleys and the growth of hills . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal diffusion and surface tension tend to smoothen the irregularities by flattening the surface .",
    "it has been observed that under the combined action of these mechanisms the surface tends to create spontaneously ripples @xcite . in nature , ripples are commonly observed in sandy - deserts as the result of dynamical instability of the sand surface under the action of a sufficiently strong wind @xcite . in this case , the formation of ripples is commonly associated with the effect produced by some grains that are lifted from the sand - bed and accelerated by the wind .",
    "these grains , when re - impact with the bed , splash up a number of other grains .",
    "most of these grains return to the bed leading to a local rearrangement , whereas some other are accelerated by the wind and impact again on the bed after a certain ` saltation ' length . in the literature , many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of ripple formation @xcite . in particular , an hydrodynamical model for aeolian ripple formation , based on a continuum dynamical description with two species of grains ( immobile and rolling grains ) , was proposed with success by bouchaud et al . @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of such a model is a bilinear differential equation , for the population of the two species of grains , which shows the instability of a flat bed against ripple formation .    in this paper",
    "we show that the same reasoning which has been used to describe the sand ripples formation in deserts , applied to the studies of dynamical surface roughening , leads to an accurate description of the morphogenesis and evolution of ripples on crystal and amorphous surfaces during ion sputtering .",
    "the present approach contains not only the bradley - harper approach @xcite ( based on a kardar - parisi - zhang type equation @xcite ) , but it is also able to describe some of the crucial experimental features recently observed in these systems @xcite . in particular , by means of this approach we can explain the two distinct dynamical behaviors experimentally observed in amorphous / semiconductors systems and in metals @xcite . in the first case ( amorphous / semiconductors )",
    "we find that the ripples growth exponentially fast at constant wavelength @xmath1 up to a critical roughening @xmath0 at which the growing process interrupts . on the other hand , in metals ( when the erlich - schwoebel barrier is active )",
    ", we find a transition between an initial exponential to a slower power - law growth of the roughness ( the root mean square of the height profile ) . in this regime",
    "the ripple - wavelength tends also to growth with time .",

    "when the surface of a solid is taken under ion sputtering some atoms in the proximity of the surface receive energy from the sputtered ions and pass from a bounded - _ ` immobile ' _ - solid state to a _",
    "` mobile ' _ melted unbounded state .",
    "the opposite mechanism is also allowed : some _ mobile _ atoms can gain in energy by becoming _",
    "immobile _ and bounding in a given position in the solid .",
    "a certain fraction of atoms might also be dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us call @xmath2 the height of surface profile made of immobile -bounded- atoms and call @xmath3 the height of mobile -melted- atoms . in analogy with the theory developed to explain the dynamical evolutions of dunes in deserts @xcite , we describe the mechanisms of excavation , exchange between mobile and immobile atoms and surface displacement of mobile atoms in term of the following differential equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rate of atoms that are excavated under the action of the sputtering , and @xmath6 is the part of them that pass from immobile to mobile , whereas @xmath7 is the fraction that is dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us now write in details the various terms contained in eq.[e1 ] .",
    "the excavation effect must clearly depend on the number and velocity of the sputtered ions ( i.e. its flux ) , but also the local shape and orientation of the surface might play an important role .",
    "indeed , the energy transmitted by the impacting ions concentrate more in regions of the surface with positive curvature .",
    "moreover , part of the surface facing the flux are likely to experience a different erosion respect to others which are less exposed to the flux .",
    "crystalline orientation and anisotropies might be also taken into account .",
    "we can write : @xmath8 here",
    "@xmath9 is the sputtering flux , whereas @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively associated with the flux - direction - dependent and with the curvature - dependent sputtering erosion .",
    "the rate of adsorption of mobile atoms into immobile solid positions must be dependent on the quantity of mobile atoms in a given spatial position .",
    "similarly to the excavation process , the adsorption is also dependent on the local curvature and orientation .",
    "we can write : @xmath12 where the parameter @xmath13 is the recombination rate and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are associated to the different probabilities of recombination in relation with the local orientation and shape of the surface .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] contains the same terms as the ones proposed in the literature for the formation of aeolian dunes in the so - called hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "indeed , in deserts , sand grains are lifted from the sand - bed and readsorbed into it with a probability which is dependent on the local shape and orientation of the dunes .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] represent the simplest analytical expressions which formally take into account these shape and orientation dependences . in the search for simple explanations ,",
    "such equations are therefore rather universal .",
    "mobile atoms will move on the surface , and the quantity @xmath16 in eq.[e1 ] is the ` current ' of these atoms . in surface growth ,",
    "there are two main mechanisms that are commonly indicated as the responsible for the surface mobility of atoms @xcite .",
    "the first is a current , driven by the variations of the local chemical potential , which tends to smoothen the surface asperity moving atoms from hills to valleys .",
    "the second is the current induced by the erlich - schwoebel barrier which -on the contrary- moves atoms uphill . in addiction to these main mechanisms we might also have to take into account a drift velocity and a random thermal diffusion , obtaining : @xmath17 in this equation , the first term describes a deterministic diffusion driven by the variations of the chemical potential which depends on the local shape of the surface ; the second term is associated with the uphill current due to the erlich - schwoebel barrier and @xmath18 is a constant associated with the characteristic length .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is a drift velocity of the mobile atoms on the surface , whereas @xmath20 is the dispersion constant associated with the random thermal motion .",
    "note that eq.[j1 ] is substantially different from the one proposed in the literature to describe ripples in granular media @xcite . here",
    "the current is supposed to be dependent on the local shape and orientation of the surface ( the @xmath21 profile ) .",
    "the equations describing sand deserts can be retrieved from eq.[j1 ] by imposing @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but -on the contrary- in surface growth these two parameters are the leading terms of the equation and play the role of control parameters in the dynamics of ripple formation .",
    "nonetheless , these terms describe a rather simple dependence of the dynamic of particles on a surface on the geometrical shape of the surface itself . again",
    ", in our seek for universality , we expect that similar terms can be profitably introduced in the context of aeolian sand ripples in order to describe specific phenomena ( associated , for instance , with packing properties @xcite or granular flow @xcite ) which relate the current of grains with the dune - shapes .",
    "it should be noted that the factors @xmath10 , @xmath14 and @xmath24 in eqs.[gex],[gad ] and [ j1 ] are _ vectors _ ( i.e. they have -in general- different components in the two horizontal directions ) . indeed , crystal surfaces are in general anisotropic and therefore one must take into account the dependence of the parameters on the relative orientation of the crystal - surface and the sputtering direction .     numerical solutions of eq.[e1 ] at various times indicate that under the action of ion sputtering the surface develops an instability which leads to the formation of ripples with a well defined characteristic wavelength . in the figure",
    "the black - tick line is the final surface - profile , whereas the tinnier - gray lines are some profiles at previous times.,width=321 ]",
    "a trivial solution of eq.[e1 ] can be written for a completely flat surface : @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this case , we obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this describes a surface that rests flat and it is eroded with a speed equal to @xmath29 . but this behavior is only hypothetical since -in general- the dynamics of the surface - profile presents instabilities against spontaneous roughening and therefore its evolution is more complex .",
    "for instance , a numerical solution of eq.[e1 ] , is shown in fig.[f.1 ] ( for the 1-dimensional case ) .",
    "we observe that , in a certain range of the parameters , the surface is unstable and periodic ripples are formed spontaneously .      in order to infer indications about the amplification or the smoothing of small perturbations and to deduce an analytical expression for the ripples wave - length at their beginning , we performe a stability analysis on eq.[e1 ] . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the surface - profile is made by the combination of a flat term plus a rough part : @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
