    "many situations of interest can be modeled by a forced system whose output depends on some external forcing .",
    "examples can be found in physics , ecology , chemistry , economics , biology and other sciences .",
    "for instance , the response of a neuron depends strongly on the input currents , such that a pulse is produced only when the total input surpasses some threshold value . in some cases ,",
    "the system is under the action of a periodic forcing and the response can be quantified by the amplitude of the periodic oscillations that the system performs at the frequency of the input .",
    "a classic example is that of a forced linear pendulum with damping terms .",
    "it is known that the response is optimal -the amplitude of the pendulum oscilations reaches a maximum- when the natural frequency of the oscillator matches that of the external forcing . in the case of non - linear oscillators a more complex behavior can appear and the region in which the system synchronizes to the external forcing might depend on the values of the parameters characterizing the system@xcite .",
    "a few decades ago , a particularly interesting resonance effect induced by random terms in the dynamics was discovered .",
    "this important phenomenon , known as stochastic resonance@xcite , shows that disorder , in the form of dynamical noise , can improve the response of a non - linear dynamical system to an external stimulus .",
    "this counterintuitive effect of noise , first proposed to explain the observed periodicity of ice - ages , has since been extended to a large variety of systems , including bistable , excitable , chaotic systems@xcite .",
    "the main result is that , under some very general conditions , the right amount of noise can help achieve a maximal synchronization of the dynamical variables in response to an external forcing .",
    "this phenomenon results in a resonance curve where some adequate measure @xmath0 of the system s response shows a maximum for a particular value of the noise intensity @xmath1 , with the response diminishing for smaller or larger @xmath1 .",
    "the generic mechanism for the resonance is the matching of some characteristic time scale of the forcing ( e.g. the period ) with a characteristic time induced by the noise ( e.g. the kramers time for jumping over a potential barrier ) .",
    "examples of this phenomenon occur in a wide variety of fields , including paleoclimatology , chemical reactions , neuronal systems , lasers and biological environments .    a different mechanism that also profits from disorder to enhance the response to an external stimulus has been shown in reference @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to take advantage of the diversity that appears in an extended system composed of many constituents .",
    "it is obvious that in many systems in biology , physics and economics , it is necessary to take into account the fact that the underlying constituents are not identical .",
    "the usual assumption that the constituents are identical is only an approximation which is usually taken for reasons of mathematical simplicity .",
    "this diversity of the elements can have many different origins : heterogeneity in a parameter ( equivalent to quenched noise ) , heterogeneity in the network of connectivities or in their strength , etc .",
    "in fact , one of the main points in @xcite is to argue that any source of disorder is able , under the right circumstances , to enhance the response to the forcing .",
    "more precisely , the authors of reference @xcite considered a system composed of @xmath2 coupled bistable -double well potential- units , subjected to an external weak periodic signal .",
    "diversity is introduced as the variability of a set of parameters @xmath3 that control the relative stability of each bistable state of the potential .",
    "if the parameter @xmath4 is equal to zero for unit @xmath5 the two potential wells have the same depth . for @xmath6",
    "the well in the right is deeper than the one on the left and vice - versa for @xmath7 . a weak periodic signal acts upon all the units .",
    "weak _ it is meant that the signal can not induce jumps between the two potential wells in the symmetric case @xmath8 .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath4 s follow a distribution of average value @xmath9 and variance @xmath10 .",
    "it is further assumed that the units are positively coupled and , hence , they all tend to stay in the same well .",
    "the mechanism for resonance is as follows : if @xmath11 , the signal is subthreshold for all units and the system responds globally with just small oscillations ; as @xmath12 increases some of the units are able to follow the signal during the half - period in which the signal goes in the direction of the preferred well ; in the other half of the period , a different set of units follows the signal .",
    "the units which follow the signal pull the other units , to whom they are attractively coupled , and the collective effect is that a significant fraction of the units is able to respond to the external forcing .",
    "if the diversity @xmath12 is too large , the units are very different from each other and some of them offer a strong resistance against following the signal . resistance which can not be overcome by the coupling between units .",
    "complementary to this _ microscopic _ mechanism for resonance in which one analyzes the behavior of individual units , it is also possible to give a _ macroscopic _ explanation in which one focuses only on the behavior of the global variable that represents the system ( usually , simply the sum of all individual variables ) .",
    "the diversity induces a degradation in the global order that results in the lowering of the effective potential barrier separating the two stable states of the collective system .",
    "the barrier can then be more easily overcome by the external forcing@xcite .",
    "the collective effect can then be understood as the result of the degradation of order induced by diversity .",
    "what is worth noticing is that any source of disorder would lead to a similar effect .",
    "this explanation sheds new light on the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in extended systems@xcite in which the disorder is induced by noise .",
    "in other cases , it is the disorder induced by the competitions in the network of connectivities between the units that induces disorder and drives the resonance@xcite .",
    "as argued in reference @xcite the proposed mechanism is generic and might appear in a large variety of systems of interest in many different fields .",
    "for instance , the role of the heterogeneous complex network topology in the amplification of external signals has also been addressed in @xcite and a recent work @xcite has shown that structural diversity enhances the cellular ability to detect extracellular weak signals .",
    "the interplay between noise and diversity in an ensemble of coupled bistable fitzhugh - nagumo elements subject to weak signal has been considered in @xcite . reference @xcite reveals that the general mechanism for collective synchronized firing in excitable systems arises from the degradation of order .",
    "the ability of diversity to enhance coherent behavior in networks with attractive and repulsive excitable systems has been addressed in @xcite and the combined effects of noise and variability in the synchronization of neural elements has been studied in @xcite .    although surprising at first , the idea that diversity in the units forming a large system can improve the response to an external signal is not against our experience@xcite .",
    "for example , a society can respond to changes in the economy if it is formed by diverse agents , such that a fraction of the population is successful at different times .",
    "it is the positive interaction between the agents that can cause the whole population to respond successfully to the changing environment .",
    "the mechanism proposed for resonance is very simple and requires only generic ingredients .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze in some detail the arguably simplest case : that of a system of globally - coupled linear oscillators subjected to a periodic forcing",
    ". diversity appears as the parameters characterizing each oscillator , namely its mass , internal frequency and damping coefficient are drawn from a probability distribution .",
    "the main ingredients for the diversity - induced resonance phenomenon are present in this system as the oscillators display a variability in the individual responses but are induced , by the coupling , to synchronize their responses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section [ sec : model ] we will define precisely the model and parameters and solve the equations of motion for the steady state .",
    "once the main formulas are established , in section [ results ] we will analyze under which conditions it is possible to find the resonance - effect .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we will end with a brief conclusion and outlook .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath2 globally coupled linear oscillators with canonical variables ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , whose evolution is given by : @xmath15 or the single equivalent equation : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the mass , the damping coefficient and the natural frequency of oscillator @xmath5 . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to take only positive values .",
    "the external forcing @xmath20 acts upon all oscillators .",
    "the all - to - all coupling term represents the tendency of all oscillators to act synchronously when the coupling coefficient @xmath21 is positive .",
    "this term can also be written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the collective ( or mean - field ) variable . in the absence of forcing , @xmath24",

    "it is easy to show directly that the energy decreases steadily : @xmath30=-\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\gamma_k}{m_k}p_k^2\\le 0,\\ ] ] hence the system relaxes to the minimum of @xmath29 : @xmath31 .",
    "the external forcing @xmath20 injects energy and produces a final state in which the variables @xmath32 oscillate in time with the frequency @xmath33 . introducing the complex notation",
    "@xmath34 we get : @xmath35 with @xmath36 . after a transient time",
    ", the variables @xmath37 tend to @xmath38 with @xmath39 , a set of ( complex ) constants obtained as : @xmath40 those values must satisfy the self - consistent relation @xmath41 .",
    "straightforward algebra leads to : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as : @xmath45    in the previous equations , note that coupling acts in two different ways : in the @xmath5-independent prefactor , i.e. as a collective effect acting equally on all the oscillators , and as the @xmath5-dependent second factor , which can be understood as a renormalization of the resonant frequency of the oscillator @xmath5 from @xmath19 to @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "a standard measure@xcite of the global response @xmath0 is the modulus of the mean variable @xmath48 normalized to the external input @xmath49 , or @xmath50 this is more easily computed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath51 , as : @xmath52 with : @xmath53 @xmath54    the expressions above are valid whatever the value of the number of oscillators @xmath2 . in the case",
    "that the number of oscillators is very large , the sums can be replaced by averages with respect to a probability distribution @xmath55 in the space of parameters @xmath56 : @xmath57 being @xmath55 the probability density function of the set of parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 any function depending on those parameters .    after a transient time , the @xmath14 linear oscillators @xmath60 oscillate in time with a frequency @xmath33 and phase @xmath61 .",
    "if all parameters @xmath62 are identical , the modulus @xmath63 and the phases @xmath61 are identical for all oscillators .",
    "if any of the parameters in the set @xmath62 varies from one oscillator to another , there is a dispersion in amplitudes and phases , see figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "there are several possible ways to quantify this dispersion in the individual dynamical output .",

    ". moreover , in the case that all units oscillate with the same amplitude @xmath70 , the definition reduces to the famous order parameter kuramoto introduced in his studies of phase synchronization@xcite . within the context of this work",
    "we will denote by @xmath71 the kuramoto order parameter : @xmath72 we also introduce a measure of the dispersion in the amplitude of the oscillators , @xmath73 as : @xmath74 it reaches the maximum value @xmath75 in the case of no dispersion in the modulus of the oscillators and decreases towards zero as the dispersion increases .    the measure of order @xmath76 can be computed as : @xmath77 the kuramoto order parameter can be computed as : @xmath78 with @xmath79 and , finally , the measure in the dispersion of the modulus of the oscillators can be written as : @xmath80",
    "most of the results in this section ( except in one case at the end of the section ) consider that the diversity only appears in the natural frequencies @xmath19 of the oscillators .",
    "these are drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath81 and variance @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath12 is a measure of the dispersion in the frequencies , it will be considered as the measure of the diversity . for most of the section , and in order not to introduce too many variable factors in the analysis , we will take the masses , @xmath17 , and damping constants , @xmath18 , to have the same values in all the units .",

    "it is apparent from this figure that , for values of @xmath33 smaller than the average value @xmath81 , the response increases and goes through a maximum -a resonance- as the diversity parameter increases .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in the figure , for @xmath33 close to @xmath81 , there can be two peaks in the resonance .",
    "those peaks merge into a single one , with decreasing height , as @xmath33 decreases .",
    "the regions of existence of the resonance can be better observed in a two dimensional plot of the response as a function of the diversity @xmath12 and the frequency @xmath33 , see figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "note that , according to this figure , the resonant frequency moves with @xmath12 to regions where there was no strong response in the absence of disorder .",
    "the _ microscopic _ argument to explain the resonance is very simple : when @xmath11 all oscillators have the same frequency @xmath81 .",
    "the response is optimal for @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath92 the oscillators are not at the optimal value .",
    "then , as @xmath12 increases , some oscillators will have frequencies close to @xmath33 and will tend to have a larger response . it is those oscillators that , through the coupling term , pull the others and produce the large response of the collective variable @xmath93 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the increase in the response is accompanied by a decrease in the order ( but not necessarily vice - versa ) .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure [ fig:3 ] where we plot the measure of order @xmath76 , as defined in eq.([eq : rho ] ) , as a function of the diversity parameter @xmath12 for different values of the frequency @xmath33 of the external forcing .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] , the kuramoto order parameter stays close to the value @xmath94 for values of @xmath12 where the resonance appears but the dispersion in the amplitude , as measured by @xmath73 , increases with @xmath12 , see figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "this shows that the oscillators lose their order through a dispersion of the modulus of their amplitude . in other words",
    ", they follow the external signal with similar phases , but with different amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] helps to demonstrate this effect .",
    "we plot in this figure the trajectories in the complex plane @xmath95 , equivalent to the phase space @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath11 , all units have the same amplitude and phase and oscillate with the external frequency @xmath33 .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , the average value @xmath48 oscillates with a larger amplitude ( and always with the frequency @xmath33 of the external forcing ) and the individual units oscillate with nearly the same phase but with different amplitudes , producing the dispersion that can be seen in the figure .",
    "coupling is essential for the resonance effect . in figure [ fig:7 ]",
    "we plot the phase space in the case of absence of coupling for the same set of parameters as those of figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the response always decreases with increasing the diversity . what it is somewhat surprising is that a too large coupling also diminishes the response",
    "this is observed in the surface plot of figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the decrease of the response for large coupling is also evident in figure [ fig:9 ] where we use the same value of the frequency as in figures [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] .",
    "so far , we have focused our attention on the case of variability in the distribution of internal frequencies @xmath19 .",
    "it is not the intention of this paper to overwhelm the reader with many figures covering the many possibilities of dispersion in the different parameters .",
    "we want to finish by plotting in the final figure [ fig:10 ] the resonance effect that appears when both the frequencies @xmath19 and the damping coefficients @xmath18 vary from one unit to the other . to maintain positivity of the damping coefficients ,",
    "we have chosen a log - normal distribution for both parameters .",
    "more concretely , we have taken @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 follows a log - normal distribution of mean @xmath100 and rms @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that a strong resonance effect appears as a function of the diversity @xmath12 ( measured now as the relative , normalized to the mean value , rms of the log - normal distributions ) .",

    "in this paper we have studied an ensemble of globally coupled linear oscillators subjected to periodic forcing .",
    "diversity appears as each unit of the ensemble has different characteristic parameters , although we have focused our main attention on the case in which only the natural frequencies vary from one oscillator to another .",
    "our intention has been to analyse with some detail an exactly solvable model that displays the phenomenon of diversity - induced resonance , namely , that the global response to the external forcing is enhanced by the presence of diversity in the units .",

    "the details of the phenomenon bear some similarities , but also some differences , with previous studies in more complicated systems .",
    "the main microscopic mechanism is as follows : in the no - diversity case , all units have the same natural frequency , which is different from the frequency of the external forcing . as the diversity in frequencies increases ,",
    "a fraction of the units have a frequency that matches that of the external forcing and are then resonant with it .",
    "those units are able , through the coupling terms , to pull the other units and the global , average , variable is able to display large amplitude oscillations .",
    "as the diversity increases even further , the difference between the units increases . some of them have then a frequency too far away from the external frequency and tend to follow the forcing with a small amplitude , hence diminishing the global response . the main difference with the mechanism analyzed in double",
    "- well systems@xcite is that , as described in the introduction , in those systems the units that are able to follow the forcing vary from time to time .",
    "that model is thus more useful to model situations of a changing environment .",
    "the analytical solution of the linear equations of motion allows a full analysis of the problem .",
    "as implied in reference @xcite , see also @xcite , the enhancement in the response appears together with a decrease in the macroscopic order .",
    "we have introduced appropriate measures of this order in terms of the dispersion in the locations of the oscillators in phase space .",
    "those measures show that the loss of order is mainly in the amplitude of the oscillations whereas the phases show a much smaller dispersion .",
