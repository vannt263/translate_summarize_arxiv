    "the materials with negative refractive index @xcite ( also known as left - handed media , lhm ) have attracted a great deal of attention during recent years @xcite . however , despite numerous efforts to bring lhms to optical or even thz domain @xcite , all modern realizations of these fascinating systems are limited to ghz waveguides@xcite .",
    "lhms associated with materials with simultaneously negative values of dielectric constant @xmath1 and magnetic permeability @xmath2 , are typically based on several interconnected resonant structures .",
    "a fraction of these resonators is used to achieve negative dipole response , while others provide negative magnetic response @xcite .",
    "this basic lhm design however immediately leads to two problems .",
    "first , high - q resonators needed in this approach , require extreme fabrication accuracy and uniformity across the the system  something which is currently unachievable on a mass - production scale .",
    "furthermore , the operation in a proximity of any resonance is typically accompanied by strong resonant absorption  with the resulting loss of resolution @xcite .    an alternative approach of using photonic crystals to achieve a negative phase velocity @xcite , besides being sensitive to minute defects in the actual fabricated structure , typically yields direction - dispersive index of refraction with corresponding deterioration of optical properties .",
    "a new approach to obtain a left - handed response has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "in contrast to the resonant - based systems described above , the proposed material is non - magnetic ( i.e. @xmath0 ) , with the negative-@xmath3 response achieved in a waveguide configuration with anisotropic dielectric core . in this work",
    "we study the imaging properties of these non - magnetic lhms , and propose their thz realization based on a homogeneous , naturally occurring material .",
    "the proposed system is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figconfig ] .",
    "it is represented by a planar ( capacitor - type ) waveguide with metal walls and anisotropic core .",
    "the dielectric constant of the core material is assumed to be uniaxial , with anisotropy axis perpendicular to the waveguide walls .",
    "an arbitrary electromagnetic wave propagating inside this system can be expressed in terms of its normal modes .",
    "each of these modes is characterized by its polarization ( with either electric [ te ] or magnetic [ tm ] vector in the waveguide plane ) and by its structure in @xmath4 ( transverse ) direction @xcite . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the propagation of a mode in the proposed system is mathematically equivalent to propagation of a plane wave in an isotropic medium governed by the free - space - like dispersion relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the propagation components of the wavevector of the mode , @xmath8 is its frequency , @xmath1 is equal to @xmath9 for tm modes and to @xmath10 for the te ones , @xmath11 , and mode parameter @xmath12 is defined solely by the mode structure in @xmath4 direction .",
    "the effective refractive index of the waveguide system is given by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , in order for the proposed planar system to support a propagating mode , the corresponding parameters @xmath1 and @xmath14 have to be of the same sign .",
    "the case of @xmath15 is typically realized in the planar systems with isotropic dielectric core @xcite and corresponds to the `` normal '' ( `` right - handed '' ) propagation .",
    "however , in contrast to this behavior , the case @xmath16 describes transparent structure with negative refractive index @xcite . in such system  similarly to the conventional ( @xmath17 ) lhms  all phenomena directly related to phase velocity ( e.g. snell s law ) are reversed . in particular , the planar slab of a non - magnetic lhm can be used to image objects within the waveguide .",
    "is plotted ; the left - handed material is extended from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ; ( left ) : imaging through the @xmath20 matched system [ @xmath21 ; ( center ) : imaging through @xmath3-matched system @xmath22 ; ( right ) imaging through the non - matched left - handed system [ @xmath23,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   is plotted ; the left - handed material is extended from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ; ( left ) : imaging through the @xmath20 matched system [ @xmath21 ; ( center ) : imaging through @xmath3-matched system @xmath22 ; ( right ) imaging through the non - matched left - handed system [ @xmath23,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   is plotted ; the left - handed material is extended from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ; ( left ) : imaging through the @xmath20 matched system [ @xmath21 ; ( center ) : imaging through @xmath3-matched system @xmath22 ; ( right ) imaging through the non - matched left - handed system [ @xmath23,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    figs .",
    "[ figimaging1 ] and [ figimaging2 ] demonstrates such imaging process . to generate the data for these figures , we numerically solved maxwell equations in the proposed system . in our numerical simulations we assumed a single - mode excitation with @xmath24 .",
    "since the main focus of this paper is on thz perspectives of lhms , we further assumed the waveguide walls to have infinite conductivity .    , but showing the _ total _ intensity @xmath25 , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] , but showing the _ total _ intensity @xmath25 , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] , but showing the _ total _ intensity @xmath25 , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    in these simulations , a source of em radiation was located at the origin ( inside the rhm part of the structure ) , and its radiated wave was represented as a series of propagating tm modes with the same frequency and mode parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we then determined the transmission and reflection coefficients for each radiation component at front ( @xmath26 ) and back ( @xmath27 ) interfaces of the lhm insert , and computed the em field throughout the system .",
    "the corresponding panels of figs .",
    "[ figimaging1 ] and [ figimaging2 ] represent the same imaging processes , but show either the value of the @xmath28 component of the field ( fig .",
    "[ figimaging1 ] ) or the total intensity at a given point ( fig .",
    "[ figimaging2 ] ) .",
    "the three different panels in each of these figures represent three principally different cases : ( i ) the case of complete @xmath20 match between lhm and rhm region [ panel ( a ) ] , ( ii ) the case when rhm and lhm structures have the same refraction index , but the constitutive parameters are not matched [ panel ( b ) ] , and ( iii ) the case when no parameters matched [ panel ( c ) ] . in each of the cases we can identify the formation of two images by an lhm slab  the first image is formed inside the left - handed structure , while the second one appears in the right `` right - handed '' system .",
    "note that the mismatch between the refractive index of right- and left - handed media in our case does not lead to a significant deterioration of the image quality .",
    "we also point out that if the source is positioned inside the lhm structure , one can effectively obtain two images on both sides of lhm region .",
    "this particular application may be useful for lasers based on sub - wavelength waveguides .",
    "as we discussed earlier , the realization of the non - magnetic left - handed materials requires a strongly anisotropic dielectric response . in this section",
    "we propose to use a material with effective electron mass anisotropy as one of the realizations of this non - magnetic lhm system .",
    "note that while no natural material having simultaneously negative @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been found so far , the materials with strongly anisotropic effective mass do exist  such as e.g. monocrystalline bismuth .",
    "the high - frequency dielectric constant of a ( semi-)conductor material containing the substantial amount of free electrons or holes is typically dominated by the dynamics of these free charge carriers .",
    "the resulting response is plasma - like , and with the dielectric constant being adequately described by the drude model@xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ( frequency - independent ) contribution of the bound electrons , @xmath31 describes inelastic processes , and the plasma frequency @xmath32 defined solely by free - charge - carrier concentration @xmath33 and effective mass @xmath34 [ eqdrude2 ] @xmath35    two points can be immediately derived from the eqs .",
    "( [ eqdrude1]-[eqdrude2 ] ) .",
    "first , the effective dielectric constant changes sign when the excitation frequency crosses the plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "second , the anisotropy of the effective mass immediately leads to the anisotropy of the plasma frequency , and correspondingly , to the anisotropy of the dielectric constant .",
    "it is therefore possible to achieve the desired strongly anisotropic dielectric constant provided that the material has strongly anisotropic effective carrier mass , and the operating frequency is between the plasma frequencies corresponding to the different effective mass directions .    ) is that of the @xmath36 crystallographic axis . the red line at the left panel corresponds to the zero of the dielectric constant , width=453 ]    we now illustrate the above considerations using the example of thin monocrystalline bismuth film , with the trigonal axis ( @xmath36 ) perpendicular to the film surface .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the effective masses of the electrons and halls in this semimetal ( by a factor of up to @xmath37 for the electron pockets ) , leads to different values of the plasma frequency depending on the direction of the electric field .",
    "in particular , for our configuration the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite yield @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , for the frequencies @xmath40 ( corresponding to thz domain ) @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ figbi ] ) .",
    "another exciting property of left - handed system based on bismuth film is the extremely low material loss .",
    "in fact , the losses in bi are so small that already in 1960s , bismuth mono - crystalline systems could yield the carrier mean free path at liquid helium temperatures on the order of _ millimeters _ - see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the typical imaginary part of the dielectric constant of bi can reach the values on the order of @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ figbi ] ) .",
    "such a low loss is extremely advantageous for imaging and transmission applications @xcite .",
    "[ figbiref ] demonstrates the refraction of a wavepacket incident onto the bi - based lhm system from a conventional waveguide .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the imaging properties of the recently proposed non - magnetic negative-@xmath3 materials .",
    "we have demonstrated that these systems can be effectively used for imaging , and that refraction index or dielectric constant matching are not critical for the system performance .",
    "we have also proposed homogeneous , ultra low - loss , naturally occurring material ( bi film ) with the strong anisotropy of the dielectric constant required for construction of non - magnetic lhms , for thz frequencies .",
