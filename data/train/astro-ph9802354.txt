    "a large part of modern observational cosmology focuses on statistical studies of the galaxy population in the universe .",
    "two problems are commonly faced that concern the properties of galaxy samples :    first , the spatial distribution of galaxies belonging to clusters is basically unknown .",
    "the image of a cluster is a 2-dimensional projection of the true 3-dimensional distribution , and one is led to question the quality of this 2d projected distribution as estimator of the true 3d one .",
    "let us recall that this point is important for understanding the true physics of the cluster , and that properties as the core radius ( lubin & postman 1996 ) and morphological segregation ( e.g. whitmore & gilmore 1991 , stein 1996 ) are derived from the 2d distributions only .",
    "second , one usually uses the slope of the count law of flux - limited extragalactic samples to estimate their completeness ( e.g. paturel et al .",
    "1994 ) and uniformity .",
    "this test is based on mattig s demonstration ( 1958 ) that , in an euclidian universe , the number @xmath1 of objects brighter than an @xmath2 magnitude is : @xmath3 .",
    "however , the validity of the reciprocal statement , that a count law with slope 0.6 in ( @xmath4 ) coordinates implies uniformity and completeness , remains to be checked carefully .",
    "the present paper aims at clarifying these two questions by means of monte - carlo simulations based on input parameters consistent with observed ones . for this purpose , a serie of test sample , containing",
    "either simulated and real data have been considered . for this purpose ,",
    "series of test samples containing either simulated or real data , have been considered .",
    "the samples are presented in section ii .",
    "section iii describes the relationship between the projected 2d and real 3d distributions of galaxies in clusters .",
    "section iv discusses the slope of counts laws and completeness .",
    "section v contains our conclusion and summary .",
    "* to check projection effects in clusters of galaxies , two projected density laws @xmath5 have been considered : + an uniform one with a constant density + a generalized 2d king law of @xmath6 exponent with core radius @xmath7 : @xmath8 ^\\beta $ ] + from these distributions , 3d spherical distributions are generated by affecting to each particle ( galaxy ) a radial coordinate @xmath9 using a gaussian random generator .",
    "we recall that the core radius @xmath7 is the same for a 2d or a 3d king profile ( girardi et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "* to check the validity of the reverse count law , we generate 3 artificial spherical random distributions .",
    "these populations of galaxies are based on uniform space density with various clustering structure .",
    "we used also four samples taken from 52 clusters of galaxies :    the first one ( sample i ) is built from amram et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) samples containing 34 spiral galaxies taken from 8 clusters . to be more complete , other morphological type galaxies have been added in order to follow a king profile according to whitmore & gilmore ( 1991 ) .",
    "the core radius of this synthetic cluster is 150 kpc .",
    "the second ( sample ii ) is a sample of 43 edinburgh - durham southern galaxy catalogue ( hereafter edsgc ) and eso nearby abell cluster survey ( hereafter enacs ) rich abell clusters ( table 1 ) kindly provided by enacs and cosmos team .",
    "these clusters are described at length in mazure et al .",

    "1997 ) , and in heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "edsgc catalog gives the projected distribution of all galaxies .",
    "the edsgc data are nearly complete for @xmath10=20 .",
    "core radii , exponent @xmath11 and center for these 43 clusters are known ( see adami et al .",
    "1997 : amk98 hereafter ) .",
    "we have selected here only nearly circular clusters to minimize ellipticity effect ( table 1 ) .",
    "we take into account only galaxies in an homogeneous zone extending across 5 core radii .",
    "this corresponds to the main part of each cluster .    the third sample ( sample iii )",
    "is taken from virgo cluster .",
    "we have more than 550 galaxies in the whole available area ( binggeli et al .",
    "we do not have the density law information but this cluster will be used only for uniformity and completeness tests .      to check the validity of the reverse count law assumption , we generate in an euclidean universe spatial distributions of objects with various uniformity and apparent magnitude completeness conditions",
    "we assume that a sample is complete if it follows in absolute magnitude a schechter luminosity function with de lapparent parameters ( 1989 ) .",
    "the range of generated absolute magnitude is [ -11,-23 ] .",
    "the first one ( sample iv ) has no structure in its space distribution , the position of each galaxy inside the volume is purely random .",
    "the uniform density is fixed to 0.06 galaxies mpc@xmath12 consistently with a projected surface density of 3 @xmath13 @xmath14 ( colless 1989 ) . for computing limitation reasons",
    ", we populate only the 1/8 fraction of a spherical volume of 300 mpc radius ( h@xmath15=100 km.s@xmath16mpc @xmath16 and q@xmath15=0 ) with 6.55 10@xmath17 galaxies",
    ". the 1/8 fraction does not affect the validity of the results .",
    "the radius of the sphere corresponds to a redshift lower than 0.1 i.e. to a space volume within which the universe is assumed to be quasi - euclidian .",
    "the galaxy absolute magnitude distribution is complete according to a schechter luminosity function with @xmath18=1.1 and @xmath19=-19.2 ( de lapparent et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in the second sample ( sample v )",
    ", the galaxies are grouped into 50 clusters of identical population .",
    "each of these clusters is a sphere of 1 mpc diameter .",
    "two spheres are in average separated by 66 mpc .",
    "the position of the cluster centers and the position of the galaxies inside the clusters are randomly generated .",
    "this mimics a distribution of galaxies in discrete groups bathing in large voids .",
    "sample vi combines a cluster distribution analog to sample v case , encompassing 2/3 of the total galaxy population with a remaining 1/3 randomly distributed as isolated objects across the whole volume .",

    "therefore , a substantial degree of inhomogeneity in the distribution of galaxies should be quite difficult to detect from observation of the counting law slope only .",
    "we use our available abell clusters ( sample ii ) as the `` real '' sample .",
    "we have calculated the slope of the count law in the range [ minimal cluster magnitude , minimal cluster magnitude + 3 ] for the largest available area of each cluster .",
    "we find a slope equal to 0.56@xmath220.11 .",
    "we note that the error on each slope is negligible compared to the global dispersion of the individual values .",

    "we find 0.58@xmath280.10 , not different from the complete case .",
    "we use now the structureless sample iv and we cut it in a more realistic way according to the exponential law of the magnitude m : 1-e@xmath32 .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is the minimum observed magnitude in the sample and @xmath34 is the theoretical limiting magnitude of the edsgc survey .",
    "we deal now with appromatively 1.07 10@xmath17 galaxies out of the original 6.55 10@xmath17 ones .",
    "we find a slope of 0.53@xmath280.02 to be compared with 0.59 @xmath280.02 ( see previous section ) .",
    "the difference is significant , but we must take into account the very small errors due to the very large number of considered galaxies .",
    "third , we use the abell clusters sample ( sample ii ) .",
    "we cut their galaxy apparent magnitude distribution with the same exponential law .when",
    "@xmath2 grows , the percentage of removed objects grows also .",
    "we reject by this way about 70@xmath0 of the galaxies .",
    "we compare the calculated slopes before and after truncation ( table 1 ) .",
    "the mean truncated value is 0.48@xmath280.09 and the mean difference between the two slopes is 0.07 ( 15% of the slope ) , lower than 1 standard error . more than 30% of the clusters exhibit a difference smaller than 10% .",
    "this difference represents an error lower than the usual accuracy of the slope determination ( when the counting errors are estimated with the usual square root of the count ) .",
    "we note however that the truncated values are systematically lower than the non truncated ones .",
    "we have shown that a 2d projection is representative at a level of 90@xmath0 of the corresponding 3d sample if it obeys a king profile and if we consider the whole cluster .",
    "the confidence level is significantly lower in the vicinity of the cluster 2d center ( typically inside 4 core radii ) and is not decisive there .",
    "we have also shown that it is somewhat unsafe to use the slope of the count law of a sample to test its completeness level and its uniformity . indeed , for the uniformity of the sample , we have almost no observable difference between a realistic artificial sample ( with 2/3 of its population in clusters ) , and a completely uniform artificial sample . for the completeness level ,",
    "the difference is about 15% between a complete sample and an incomplete one .",
    "this difference represents an error lower than the usual accuracy of the slope determination .",
    "we conclude that the slope of the count law , in itself , is not a decisive factor to assess uncompleteness and homogeneity of a sample ."
