    "one of the most vexing problems in theoretical particle physics is the magnitude of the vacuum energy density , @xmath0 .",
    "ironically , einstein introduced it into general relativity through the field equation g _",
    "r_-12 g_r = 8g(t _ + g _ ) in order to find static cosmological solutions .",
    "he called it his `` biggest blunder '' when the universe was subsequently found to be expanding .",
    "generically the presence of a positive cosmological constant leads to a universe which is accelerating , not static , but from the friedmann equation we see that the scale factor can be static for a fine - tuned value of @xmath0 , ( aa)^2 = 8g3(+ ) - ka^2 ( in fact one must also tune @xmath1 to be zero ) .",
    "the irony of einstein s supposed blunder is three - fold .",
    "first , of course , the universe is not static ; second , particle theorists came to realize that @xmath0 should be present due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum , which can be visualized as spontaneous creation and annihilation of particle / antiparticle pairs .",
    "third , there is now strong evidence from cosmology that @xmath0 is nonzero , ( 2.410 ^ -3)^4 since the universe appears to be accelerating and at critical density , even though there is not enough dark matter to account for most of the energy density .",
    "the big problem is that naive computations of the theoretical value of @xmath0 from quantum field theory give a value which is many orders of magnitude greater , _ theo . ~(10",
    "^ 28)^4 there must be some mechanism for explaining the difference between the observed and expected values , but so far no really convincing idea has been proposed .",
    "one might suspect some kind of adjustment mechanism is at work , which somehow nullifies the effect of @xmath0 no matter what its underlying value might be .",
    "however weinberg has given a no - go theorem against such ideas @xcite .",
    "for example , one might imagine that the effective physical value of @xmath2 $ ] depends on the underlying value @xmath3 and upon a scalar field @xmath4 which automatically adjusts itself so that @xmath2=0 $ ] . to be concrete ,",
    "consider @xmath5 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "although there are values of @xmath4 where @xmath6 , they are not generally stationary , so fine tuning is still required .",
    "although this is very obvious in the present example , weinberg s theorem shows that essentially the same problem will plague even more clever attempts to implement such an idea .",
    "[ fig1 ]     weinberg s theorem assumes that the universe is 4-dimensional , so one might hope that recent brane - world ideas might provide a loophole . in the braneworld picture illustrated in fig.1(b ) , we have an extra dimension , @xmath7 , surrounding our 4-d universe which is presumed to be the brane at @xmath8 .",
    "one could imagine that the effects of the vacuum energy density on the brane are counteracted by some new physics in the bulk .",
    "if the 5-d nature of this setup ca nt be described by an approximate 4-d picture , then it might be possible to evade the no - go theorem .",
    "some attempts at constructing a self - tuning solution to the cosmological constant problem were presented in references @xcite .",
    "the idea is to add a scalar field @xmath4 in the bulk , which is described by the metric ds^2 = a^2(y ) dx_dx^+ dy^2 the scalar is presumed to couple to the bare energy density of the brane , @xmath3 through a potential @xmath9 .",
    "the coupled field equations for the scalar and the metric give rise to a solution which is singular at some position @xmath10 in the bulk , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 depends on @xmath3 , which is what constitutes the self tuning . in other words , for any value of @xmath3 , a static solution can be found with some value of @xmath10 .",
    "it is precisely because the solution is static rather than exponentially expanding that an observer would infer that the physical value of @xmath0 is zero .",
    "[ fig2 ]     there are a number of problems with this idea @xcite .",
    "for one , the static solution is not unique : one can also find expanding or contracting ones @xcite , which shows that fine tuning of the initial conditions are needed to get the static solution .",
    "moreover we do nt like the presence of naked singularities .",
    "the cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts that singularities should be hidden behind an event horizon , as is the case with a black hole .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a modification to the previous self - tuning model which includes a horizon , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . the points @xmath11 are identified with each other by imposing a @xmath12 orbifolding .    in this solution ,",
    "the metric becomes the ads - reissner - nrdstrom solution shown in fig .  3 , ds^2 = -h(y ) dt^2 + a^2(y )",
    "dx^2 + h^-1(y ) dy^2 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the radius of curvature of the 5-d anti - desitter space , @xmath16 is mass of the black brane and @xmath17 is its charge under a u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the self - tuning is now accomplished by @xmath16 and @xmath17 taking on the appropriate values to cancel the effect of the energy density @xmath18 which is on the brane .",
    "note that these quantities appear not as inputs to the lagrangian , but rather as integration constants in the bulk solution .",
    "however , this @xmath18 can not be quite the same thing as a cosmological constant because the self - tuning solution works only for a rather bizarre equation of state for the energy density on the brane : p < -this is in contrast to a vacuum energy density which obeys @xmath19 , and is in violation of the weak energy condition .",
    "such violations may not always be bad , but at least in the case of a classical scalar field theory they are problematic .",
    "there we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that @xmath22 implies @xmath23 : negative kinetic energy .",
    "this would correspond to a ghost which leads to nonconservation of probability in quantum field theory .",
    "our goal in the present work was to try to find a self - tuning solution with a horizon and without violating the weak energy condition .",
    "unfortunately , we found instead another no - go theorem : one must have @xmath24 either on the brane or in the bulk , as we will now describe @xcite .    [ fig3 ]   for the 5-d ads - reissner - nrdstrom spacetime.,title=\"fig : \" ]      before discovering our no - go result ,",
    "we searched for a generalization of the original solution which would hopefully give us more leeway . a natural possibility is to try adding a scalar field in the bulk , so the lagrangian becomes = ( 12 g^ _ _ -v ( ) - v_0()(y ) ) we obtained numerical solutions using various potentials and found empirically that a horizon could be obtained only when the black hole charge @xmath25 became negative .",
    "interestingly , @xmath26 implies that @xmath24 for the bulk stress energy tensor contributed by the gauge field .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the violation of the weak energy condition is actually necessary for obtaining a horizon . by adding together the ( 00 ) and one of the spatial ( @xmath27 ) components of the einstein equations , and integrating from the outer horizon ( @xmath28 ) to the brane ( @xmath29 ) , we obtain [ nogo ] h(y_h ) = - ^2a^3(2_y_h^y_b ( t^0 _  0-t^1 _  1 ) a^3 dy + ( + p)|_y_b ) where @xmath30 is the 5-d gravitational constant and @xmath31 is the bulk stress energy tensor . in particular , @xmath32 is the bulk contribution to @xmath33 .",
    "notice the minus sign in front of everything , and the fact that @xmath34 must be positive at the outer horizon ( see fig .",
    "these two facts conspire to need @xmath35 to be negative somewhere , in the bulk , the brane or both .",
    "this conclusion is independent of any details of the theory like the choice of scalar potentials .",
    "we have also found it to be robust against other generalizations : arbitrary field content in the bulk , addition of higher derivative terms to the gravitational action , such as gauss - bonnet , and also relaxation of the @xmath12 symmetry we assumed around the brane .",
    "for example , the gb action is s = 12 ^ 2d^5x(r + ( r^2 - 4r_abr^ab + r_abcdr^abcd ) ) we find that the no - go result ( [ nogo ] ) gets modified by the factor .(1-(a/a)^2 h ) h |_y_h = but since @xmath36 at the horizon by definition , the left - hand - side is in effect unmodified .    relaxing the @xmath12 symmetry amounts to having two different black holes with different values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the two sides of the branes , with horizons at different distances .",
    "this does not change the conclusion .",
    "there is one apparent loophole , which is to allow for spatial curvature on the brane .",
    "the friedmann equation becomes @xmath37 in 4-d , where @xmath38 for positive , zero or negative spatial curvature , respectively . in our no - go theorem",
    "we assumed @xmath39 , which is consistent with observations of the cosmic microwave background and expectations from inflation . with this modification",
    "we obtain h(y_h ) = + 4ka^3_y_h^y_b a dy this term allows us to obtain a positive value for @xmath40 even if @xmath41 everywhere , provided that @xmath42 .",
    "however , this does not solve the cosmological constant problem because it requires that @xmath3 already be of order @xmath43 ev@xmath44 , which is the original fine - tuning problem all over again .",
    "larger values of @xmath3 would require larger curvatures , which are observationally excluded .    as a final attempt",
    ", one might try the same trick except with a very large curvature in some hidden extra dimensions rather than the large ones .",
    "however , the new terms in the einstein equations which depend on the extra - dimensional curvature exactly cancel out of the combination @xmath45 which gave us the no - go result , so this does not help .",
    "it seems that nature abhors the self - tuning idea .",
    "each time we attempt to cure one problem , it introduces a new pathology .",
    "ref.@xcite tried to cure the problem of the naked singularity by hiding it behind a horizon , but had to violate the weak energy condition to do so .",
    "we find that allowing for positive spatial curvature can cure this problem , but only at the price of reintroducing the original fine - tuning problem .",
    "it is a good illustration of why the cosmological constant problem is one of the most daunting in theoretical physics .",
    "some progress with self - tuning seems to have been made recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it remains a challenge to understand how constants of integration which correspond to physical sources of stress energy can dynamically adjust in a situation where the vacuum energy is changing , as in a phase transition , or alternatively , how they can `` know '' which value is the ultimate one that must be canceled .",
    "it would seem to be a very intelligent mechanism that could fully allow for the effects of vacuum energy during inflation but not in the present .",
