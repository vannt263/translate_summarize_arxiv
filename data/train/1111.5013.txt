    "tidal tails of galactic satellites like dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular clusters are interesting structures as they tell the story of the dynamical past of the corresponding object .",
    "the most prominent feature of tidal tails is their large extent across their host galaxy @xcite . from the shape of extended tidal tails it is possible to infer the orbit of their progenitor satellite @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the satellite orbit can be further improved when radial velocity or proper motion data of tidal tail stars is available @xcite .",
    "tidal tails , however , also contain additional information .",
    "variations of the stellar density along the tails have been observed for extended tidal streams such as the milky way globular cluster palomar 5 @xcite . for other milky way satellites , such as ngc 288 , willman 1 and ngc 2298 , multiple tidal tails",
    "have been observed @xcite .",
    "this substructure should also be somehow linked to the dynamical past of the satellite .    in the common picture ,",
    "substructure is created by tidal variations , such as tidal shocks , which temporarily increase the mass loss rate of the satellite @xcite .",
    "tidal tails which are produced in such a violent way should be dynamically hotter and thus broader than tails originating from dynamical evaporation . extended satellites like dwarf spheroidal galaxies often show such tidal streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but tidal tails of star clusters appear to be typically more compact and colder @xcite suggesting that they are mainly being produced by dynamical evaporation .    in numerical investigations it has been shown that for star clusters , tidal variations have to be , in fact , very extreme in order to cause substructure in their tidal tails @xcite . this is due to the compactness of star clusters which makes them less vulnerable to tidal stripping . observed substructure in tidal tails of star clusters is , therefore , most likely not due to tidal variations .    on the contrary",
    ", it has been shown that substructure can even arise in tidal tails of star clusters which move in a steady tidal field @xcite .",
    "this substructure is caused by the epicyclic motion performed by a continuous stream of stars evaporating from the cluster .",
    "it has been shown analytically and numerically that this substructure can be related to the internal properties of the star cluster ( its mass ) and its external properties ( its orbit about the galaxy ) .",
    "moreover , star clusters on eccentric orbits were also found to produce tidal tail substructure in this way , rather than through tidal shocks @xcite .",
    "however , clumps in tidal tails may also be produced when parts of a stellar stream pass a spiral arm , a giant molecular cloud or a massive dark - matter subhalo ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the formation of substructure in tidal tails is of vital importance when interpreting observations of clumpy tidal tails .    in the present investigation",
    "we show with the help of streaklines exactly how the epicyclic motion of escaping stars leads to substructure in tidal tails of star clusters on circular and eccentric orbits ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "then we compare results from @xmath0-body computations to theoretical streaklines to visualise the path of escaping stars and to demonstrate the accuracy of the much more rapid method of streaklines ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) . in the last section",
    "we give a brief summary and discuss our results .",
    "due to energy equipartition , stars in a star cluster permanently exchange energy .",
    "this process is called two - body relaxation and leads to the continuous escape of stars from the cluster , since again and again some stars gain energies above the escape energy ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , in most cases , even if they are energetically unbound , stars will stay within the cluster for several dynamical timescales .",
    "these `` potential escapers '' , are preferentially located at large cluster radii where the dynamical timescale is of the order of the orbital timescale of the star cluster about the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in fact , a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile has been observed in the outer parts of milky way globular clusters like 47 tucanae @xcite , which may well be interpreted as the contribution from potential escapers .",
    "external energy which is added to a cluster , for instance through tidal shocks , is redistributed within the cluster in the same way .",
    "the additional energy causes more stars to escape from the cluster in a given time interval but does not immediately influence the structure of the cluster @xcite . for this reason",
    "tidal shocks do not inevitably lead to substructure in tidal tails as the escape of unbound stars is delayed with respect to the tidal shock @xcite .",
    "note that this may be significantly different for extended objects with large relaxation times such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies , especially when they are on very eccentric orbits about their host galaxy ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    inside the cluster ,",
    "each star moves within the gravitational field of the other cluster stars plus the external tidal field of the galaxy . in the cluster reference frame ,",
    "in which the cluster is at rest , the motion of stars is complicated by the coriolis , centrifugal and euler pseudo forces resulting from the cluster s orbital motion about the galactic centre ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this effective potential of the cluster is attractive towards the cluster centre within the tidal sphere with radius @xmath2 .",
    "this radius gives the distance to the lagrange points from the cluster centre along the radial direction connecting the galactic centre with the cluster centre , i.e. the radius at which the cluster attraction equals the effective force of the external field .",
    "it is often denoted as the tidal radius and can be approximated for circular cluster orbits in a milky way - like potential as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the cluster mass , and @xmath6 is the cluster s angular velocity about the galactic centre ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for eccentric cluster orbits",
    "the tidal radius can be calculated using @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the galactic potential and @xmath9 is the cluster s galactocentric distance ( e.g.  @xcite ) . due to the dependence on @xmath6 , the tidal radius can change significantly between peri- and apogalacticon for clusters on eccentric orbits .",
    "when a star evaporates from a cluster it will most likely escape through one of the two lagrange points @xmath10 ( closer to the galactic centre ) or @xmath11 ( further away from the galactic centre ) , since escape is easiest through these points , finally ending up in the leading or trailing tidal tail , respectively .",
    "note that the estimate of the limiting radius ( eq .  [ eq : rt ] ) was derived for a star instantaneously situated between the cluster and the galactic centre ( see @xcite ) .",
    "considerable subsequent research has shown that stars well outside this estimate of the limiting radius may well remain attached to the cluster , for example those on appropriate retrograde orbits @xcite .",
    "hence , we should keep in mind that at any time there will be stars outside the radius @xmath2 which are actually still bound to the cluster , and that there are stars escaping from radii smaller than @xmath2 .    outside the tidal radius ,",
    "the effective potential is repulsive in some directions such that stars feel a drag away from the cluster once they escape from its tidal sphere .",
    "hence , the gravitational field of the cluster quickly becomes unimportant for the motion of the escapers . within the tails",
    "the stars will perform an epicyclic motion due to the pseudo forces mentioned above ( plus the tidal force ) , in which the stars will be periodically accelerated and decelerated while moving along the tidal tails .",
    "how this epicyclic motion looks depends on the escape conditions of the stars . in the case where the escape conditions of many escaping stars are similar",
    ", their epicyclic motions will lead to an over- and underdensity pattern .",
    "this is a statistical effect , which is due to the fact that there is a higher probability for the presence of stars within the epicyclic cusps than in between two cusps .    in the following we",
    "briefly review how the epicyclic motions of escaping stars depend on the escape conditions .",
    "for three different star cluster models we then show how the orbit influences the epicyclic trajectories of escaping stars .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the influence of the cluster mass on these trajectories .",
    "since the stellar trajectories can not be calculated analytically for clusters on eccentric orbits or when the cluster mass is taken into account , we use streaklines as often applied in fluid dynamics to visualise the tracks of escaping stars ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : streaklines ] ) .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown for star clusters on circular orbits that , in a coordinate system in which the cluster is at rest ( x - axis points towards the galactic anticentre , y - axis points into the direction of cluster motion ) , the length of an escaper s epicycle along the corresponding tidal tail ( leading or trailing ) , @xmath12 , can be analytically related to the tidal radius , @xmath2 , of the cluster by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the epicyclic frequency of the specific galactic potential . for clusters in milky way - like tidal fields",
    "@xmath15 holds @xcite , such that eq .",
    "[ eq : yc ] reduces to @xmath16 in this calculation it is assumed that the escaping star evaporates from one of the two lagrange points and has exactly the same angular velocity , @xmath6 , as the cluster at the moment of escape .",
    "moreover , the influence of the gravitational attraction of the cluster is neglected in this ansatz .",
    "@xcite found a more general solution for the length of the epicycles , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is some distance from the cluster centre to the point of escape along the radial direction connecting cluster centre and galactic centre , and @xmath20 is some additional velocity along the cluster orbit in the direction of the corresponding tail . for a milky way - like potential",
    "this simplifies to @xmath21 which gives eq .",
    "[ eq : yc2 ] for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , if a star escapes from a radius larger or smaller than the tidal radius , the epicycle gets larger or smaller , respectively .",
    "furthermore , an additional tangential velocity in the direction of the corresponding tail will increase the epicycle length of a star , whereas an additional tangential velocity in the opposite direction to the corresponding tail will decrease the epicycle length .",
    "the radial offset and the radial amplitude of the epicyclic motion ( the x - component of the epicyclic motion ) was derived analytically by @xcite .",
    "this part of the epicyclic movement depends on the initial radial offset , @xmath19 , and on the additional tangential velocity along the tidal tails , @xmath20 .",
    "it is given by @xmath24 where we corrected a typo in the original just et al .  equation .",
    "this amplitude reduces in a milky way - like potential to @xmath25 that is if @xmath20 is zero then the escapers oscillate around a radius of @xmath26 with an amplitude of @xmath26 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown with a comprehensive set of @xmath0-body models that the epicycles of escaping stars from clusters on circular orbits are on average a bit larger than predicted when assuming @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the framework of this theory , this increase in length",
    "can be due to both @xmath27 or @xmath28 . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate that this discrepancy is , in fact , due to the neglected cluster mass .",
    "since there is no simple analytical solution to the problem when the cluster mass is taken into account , we can only prove this assumption numerically , which will be done using streaklines .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated in @xcite that epicyclic motion of escaping stars also leads to over- and underdensities in tidal tails of star clusters moving on eccentric orbits .",
    "even though the shape and density distribution along the tails gets significantly more complicated for such clusters , it was shown that the distance of the epicyclic overdensities could be related to a mean escape radius and a mean escape velocity . due to the periodic acceleration and deceleration of the cluster and the tail stars within the orbit about the galactic centre ,",
    "the distance from the cluster to the overdensities periodically increases or decreases , respectively . for this problem",
    "there is no simple analytical solution either , therefore , in the following we are also going to visualise the trajectories of escaping stars for such cluster orbits using streaklines .",
    "-body models which were used in this analysis for comparison with the theoretical streaklines .",
    "one model is on a circular orbit , one has an orbital eccentricity of 0.25 and the third model follows an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.5 .",

    "the eccentricity is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath30 is the cluster s apogalactic distance and @xmath31 its perigalactic distance .",
    "a circular orbit therefore has an eccentricity of 0 .    for the integration of the orbits we use the milky way - like potential suggested by @xcite .",
    "this galactic potential , @xmath8 , consists of a central point - mass potential given by @xmath36 a @xcite disk potential given by @xmath37 and a halo potential of the form @xmath38_r^{100},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 the numerical constants @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen such that the combined potential of the three components has a circular velocity of 220 kms@xmath47 at 8.5 kpc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the apogalactic distance of all three clusters is 8.5 kpc ( which is a somewhat arbitrary choice ) .",
    "therefore , the circular orbit has a constant orbital velocity , @xmath34 , of 220 kms@xmath47 , whereas the eccentric orbits have an orbital velocity of 165 kms@xmath47 and 110 kms@xmath47 at apogalacticon for an eccentricity of 0.25 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "their perigalactic distances are 5.1 kpc and 2.8 kpc , respectively , and their velocities at these orbital phases are 275 kms@xmath47 and 334 kms@xmath47 .",
    "the orbital timescale is 240 myr for the circular case , 133 myr for @xmath48 and 113 myr for @xmath49 .",
    "an overview of these quantities is given in tab .",

    "[ orbit ] the integrated orbits are shown for 400 myr .",
    "the shape and structure of tidal tails for star clusters on eccentric orbits is strongly influenced by the orbital phase of the cluster @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the changes between the different orbital phases , we pick four snapshots from the integrations of each of the two eccentric orbits .",
    "the snapshots are taken in steps of 30 myr starting from apogalacticon . in the next snapshots the clusters are in an orbital phase between apogalacticon and perigalacticon in which the clusters are accelerated towards the galactic centre .",
    "the third snapshots are close to perigalacticon , and the last ones are between perigalacticon and apogalacticon in which the clusters and their tails are decelerated .",

    "one way to quantify the orbital phase , @xmath33 , of a star cluster in its orbit about the galaxy is given in @xcite by @xmath50 where @xmath32 is the cluster s current galactocentric radius , and @xmath51 is the time derivative of this radius .",
    "in this way , the orbital phase is zero at perigalacticon and unity at apogalacticon ( in fact @xmath52 ) .",
    "moreover , it is negative when the cluster is moving to perigalacticon and positive if its moving to apogalacticon .",
    "the orbital phases of the cluster snapshots which we investigate in detail are given in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] .                           in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it was shown that the orbits of stars escaping from a cluster can , under certain assumptions , be integrated analytically . in this simplified case",
    "a star is released from the cluster centre with a certain positive or negative offset along the galactocentric radius , and with some negative or positive offset velocity with respect to the cluster .",
    "one of the main assumptions here is that the cluster moves in a circular orbit about the galactic centre .",
    "moreover , the cluster mass is neglected in this calculation .",
    "for eccentric cluster orbits such a general analytical solution does not exist .",
    "in addition , the trajectories of escaping stars depend on the orbital phase of the cluster in this case . instead of solving the equations of motion analytically",
    ", we can simply illustrate the trajectories of stars for eccentric cluster orbits by using streaklines .",
    "this is a concept from fluid dynamics in which test particles are released into a fluid from a given point to visualise the flow . in engineering streaklines",
    "are often produced with smoke or dye .",
    "to produce the streaklines we integrate the cluster orbit and , at given time intervals , release test particles .",
    "these particles have a certain velocity , @xmath53 , and are released from two points which are given by the cluster centre plus a fixed positive or negative radial offset , @xmath19 , along the galactocentric radius vector .",
    "all released test particles are then integrated together with the cluster to the point in time of the snapshot .",
    "the gravitational influence of the cluster on the test particles is taken into account in the cases where it is mentioned explicitly . there is no interaction between the test particles .    for this purpose , it is not reasonable to stay within the rotating , accelerated reference frame in which a cluster on a circular orbit is at rest , for which the analytical solutions of @xcite and @xcite have been developed .",
    "thus , we have to keep in mind that we have to convert the tangential offset velocities in the rotating coordinate system , @xmath20 , to the cartesian , galactocentric rest frame velocities , @xmath53 , when applying eq .",
    "[ eq : yc3 ] .",
    "first we illustrate that the technique works correctly by comparing it with results from the formalism described in sec .",
    "[ sec : epi ] for circular orbits .",
    "therefore , we produce three sets of streaklines in which the test particles are released with three different velocities , @xmath53 , from the cluster on a circular orbit :    1 .",
    "[ v1 ] the test particles are released with the same angular velocity as the cluster , @xmath6 , i.e.  the test particles which are released from the larger galactocentric radius have a higher orbital velocity than the cluster , @xmath54 , whereas the test particles at the smaller galactocentric radius have a lower orbital velocity , @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq : yc3 ] , 2 .",
    "[ v2 ] the test particles have the same orbital velocity as the cluster , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath57 in eq .",
    "[ eq : yc3 ] , 3 .",
    "[ v3 ] the test particles have an orbital velocity in between the two cases , i.e. @xmath58 corresponding in the galactocentric rest frame to @xmath59 for the leading tail and @xmath60 for the trailing tail , respectively .    these sets of streaklines we also produce for the eccentric orbits to see how the orbital acceleration and deceleration influence the trajectories of escaping stars .",
    "finally , we produce additional sets of streaklines for which the mass of the cluster is taken into account .",
    "the cluster mass has so far been neglected but will , of course , influence the trajectories of escaping stars .",
    "the cluster can attract stars and even re - capture them if they happen to lie beyond the tidal radius ( given by eq .",
    "[ eq : rt ] ) at some later orbital phase .",
    "@xcite , for example , demonstrated that stars orbiting the cluster on prograde orbits with respect to the cluster motion about the galactic centre can escape the cluster potential more easily than stars on retrograde orbits .",
    "we therefore have to consider from which radius we release the test particles to produce the streaklines .    if we chose to release the test particles from the apogalactic tidal radius , which is the largest tidal radius throughout the orbit since the cluster has the lowest angular velocity at this point ( see tab .  [ table1 ] ) , then we may expect that virtually all test particles will escape the gravitational attraction of the cluster mass .",
    "this , however , might not be the most realistic approach .",
    "if we , on the other hand , chose to release the test particles always from the actual tidal radius , @xmath61 ( eq .  [ eq : rt ] ) , at the given time , @xmath62 , then many test particles may be re - captured .",
    "this will especially be a problem for the test particles released near perigalacticon since the tidal radius is smallest here and , in addition , changes rapidly in this orbital phase as the angular velocity is largest at this point .    as we will demonstrate later , for this reason it is necessary to introduce a minimum radius from which test particles can be released such that no test particles gets re - captured .",
    "this radius we call the `` edge '' radius , @xmath63 , and it serves as a lower limit to the actual radius from which test particles will be released , i.e. @xmath64 we determine the value of this edge radius by incrementally increasing the lower limit from the value of the perigalactic tidal radius until no test particle is re - captured .",
    "in the following we will show that , for circular cluster orbits , this edge radius coincides with the constant tidal radius , since any particle released from rest from a smaller cluster radius will not be able to escape from the cluster potential ( for the given escape conditions [ v1]-[v3 ] ) . for eccentric orbits",
    "this value is smaller than the apogalactic tidal radius but significantly larger than the perigalactic tidal radius .",
    "its value decreases with increasing eccentricity for fixed apocentric distance .      in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ streak_circular ] the resulting streaklines for the circular cluster orbit are shown .",
    "the dashed line gives the orbit of the cluster . along this orbit test particles",
    "have been released in constant time intervals with a positive or negative spatial offset , @xmath19 , from the cluster centre along the galactocentric radius vector and with one of the three velocity offsets , @xmath20 , given above .",
    "we chose @xmath19 to be 60 pc , which is a somewhat arbitrary choice .",
    "the cluster and the test particles have each been independently integrated to the point in time of the snapshot .",
    "hence , there is no gravitational influence of the cluster on the test particles .    from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ streak_circular ] it can be seen that the analytical results of @xcite and @xcite are nicely reproduced when the test particles are released with the same angular velocity as the cluster ( black solid line ) .",
    "moreover , if the orbital velocity of the test particles at the larger ( smaller ) galactocentric radius is lower ( higher ) than in the case of equal angular velocity , the length of the epicycle is shorter ( blue solid line ) .    in the case",
    "when the test particles have the same orbital velocity as the cluster then the epicycles should , in principle , be half as short as in the case of sharing the cluster s angular velocity , since @xmath65 instead , we see that the the test particles follow a circular orbit ( red solid line ) . from eq .",
    "[ eq : xm ] we see that , in the case when @xmath57 , the radial extrema in the epicycles are at @xmath66 hence , the radial amplitude is zero , and the test particles are moving on a circular orbit about the galactic centre with a radial offset to the cluster of size @xmath19 .    the theoretical framework ( eq .  [ eq : yc][eq : xm ] ) is in perfect agreement with our streaklines .",
    "now we include the gravitational attraction of the cluster in our computations .",
    "the mass of the cluster in this computation is chosen such that the tidal radius , @xmath2 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : rt ] ) , coincides with the starting point of the test particles , @xmath19 , i.e.  60 pc in our example .    as we can see in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ streak_circular ] , the cluster mass increases the length of the epicycles , @xmath12 , by about 25% .",
    "moreover , the sharp cusp at @xmath12 is replaced by a smooth minimum , and the radial distance of the test particles from the cluster orbit , @xmath19 , is larger on average .",
    "the radial amplitude appears to be damped by a factor of about 0.6 when the cluster mass is taken into account .",
    "all these effects can be explained when looking at the shape of the effective potential of cluster and galaxy near the tidal radius ( see e.g.  figure 2 of @xcite ) . beyond the tidal radius",
    "the effective potential is repulsive such that the test particles get accelerated away from the cluster .",
    "@xcite found that , due to jacobi - energy conservation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , a test particle starting at @xmath22 with @xmath23 will be at @xmath67 if it ever comes to rest again in the future .",
    "in fact , the test particles in the minimum of our example are less than 10% off this value as they still have a velocity of 0.5 km / s with respect to their initial conditions .",
    "note that , since the distance of the lagrange points as well as the length of the epicycles scales with the mass of the cluster , the effect of the cluster mass on the trajectories will always be the same .",
    "stars escaping from a larger radius than the tidal radius will , of course , be less influenced by the cluster mass .",
    "their trajectories will look more like the ones for which we neglected the cluster mass .      in fig .",
    "[ 1204_streak ] the streaklines of the cluster in an eccentric orbit with eccentricity 0.25 are shown for four different orbital phases . here ,",
    "again , the cluster mass was neglected . also , we chose @xmath19 to be 60 pc like in the previous example .",
    "we see that the streaklines are distorted in comparison to the circular orbit case ( fig .",
    "[ streak_circular ] ) . moreover , the distortion depends on the orbital phase of the cluster . at apogalacticon",
    "the streaklines appear to be similar to the circular orbit case but squeezed together .",
    "the length of the epicycles is much shorter than in the circular orbit case and epicyclic loops further away from the cluster are tilted towards the cluster orbit .    between apo- and perigalacticon ,",
    "when the cluster and the test particles are accelerated towards the galactic centre , the tilt of the epicyclic loops gets stronger , whereas the length of the epicycles increases . at perigalacticon",
    "the epicyclic loops are almost completely aligned with the cluster orbit .",
    "the length of the epicycles is largest in this orbital phase . between peri- and apogalacticon ,",
    "when the cluster and the test particles are decelerated , the tilt gets weaker , the epicycles shorter and the loop structure gets more pronounced .    also apparent from fig .",
    "[ 1204_streak ] is the thickness of the tidal tails . assuming that most stars follow such an epicyclic motion",
    ", we can expect the tidal tails to be thickest at apogalacticon and thinnest at perigalacticon .",
    "moreover , we see that we get epicyclic motion even when the escaping stars have the same orbital velocity as the cluster .",
    "this is due to the stars and the cluster being on slightly different eccentric orbits about the galactic centre .",
    "the same is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1203_streak ] for the cluster with an orbital eccentricity of 0.5 .",
    "all effects described above get more pronounced . furthermore , with increasing orbital eccentricity it gets more difficult to separate the individual streaklines as the epicyclic loops overlap multiply .    in these illustrations the offset radius , @xmath19 , from which the test particles have been released were the same for all snapshots .",
    "when we take the cluster mass into account in our computations then we can fix @xmath19 to the apogalactic tidal radius in order to be able to better compare the resulting streaklines to fig .",

    "the two snapshots in between appear quite different even though the cluster is in a similar orbital phase , only being accelerated in the one snapshot and decelerated in the other .",
    "the distance of the overdensities is comparable , whereas the shape of the tails is very distinct . in between peri- and apogalacticon",

[ eq : rt ] ) . however , since the tidal radius at perigalacticon is very small ( 24.8 pc ) and the passage through perigalacticon is quite fast , there are many test particles which get re - captured from the cluster as it moves to apogalacticon . therefore , we had to introduce a minimum radius , @xmath63 , from which test particles are released ( see sec .",

    "the orbital compression of the tails gets stronger at apogalacticon .",
    "the overdensities are very close to each other and the tails are very broad .",
    "moreover , they show prominent streaky features . at perigalacticon",
    "the tails become even thinner than in the @xmath78 case . from the snapshot between peri- and apogalacticon",
    "we can see that the cluster - tail system is experiencing severe differential acceleration , such that the leading tail ( to the right ) is already being broadened , whereas the trailing tail is still quite thin .",
    "the red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ 1203_sim ] have been produced by releasing test particles from the actual tidal radius and assuming a minimum tidal radius ( edge radius ) of 18.0 pc ( eq .  [ eq : xoft ] ) .",
    "the perigalactic tidal radius of this cluster is 12.9 pc and the apogalactic tidal radius is 36.4 pc .",
    "hence , the edge radius is about 50% of the apogalactic tidal radius . again , as for the cluster with an orbital eccentricity of 0.25 , this choice of escape conditions reproduces the @xmath0-body data remarkably well .    finally , from fig .",
    "[ 1204_sim ] & [ 1203_sim ] it is obvious that all substructure within the tidal tails can be ascribed to epicyclic motion of tail stars .",
    "this rules out tidal shocks as origin of substructure in these systems .",
    "moreover , it demonstrates how complex the motion of stars within tidal tails of star clusters like pal 5 can be , and thus how unlikely the formation of overdensities in such tidal tails through jeans instabilities is @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the motion of stars escaping from star clusters using streaklines ( for details on streaklines see sec .",
    "[ sec : streaklines ] ) , focussing on three star cluster models with orbital eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.25 and 0.5 ( further description of the models in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we demonstrated how escaping stars move on epicycles within tidal tails ( sec .",
    "[ sec : circular ] & [ sec : eccentric ] ) , and that this epicyclic motion is the only origin of the substructure observed in @xmath0-body computations of dissolving star clusters ( sec .  [",
    "sec : numerical ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown analytically and numerically for circular cluster orbits , how the length of the epicycles changes with the size of the radial offset , @xmath19 , escaping stars have with respect to the cluster orbit at the moment of escape .",
    "here we visualised , with the help of streaklines , how the shape of the epicycles changes when we vary the tangential velocity , @xmath20 , of the escaping stars .",
    "in fact , the shape of the epicycles and thus the tidal tails is very sensitive to this velocity .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated how this motion gets distorted when the cluster orbit is eccentric , and what ( important ) influence the cluster mass has .",
    "when a cluster on an eccentric orbit is close to apogalacticon then the epicyclic motion of stars within its tails may lead to streaks appearing like multiple tails .",
    "such features have been observed in numerical simulations before @xcite , but have not yet been interpreted as result of epicyclic motion .",
    "the streaks may also be the true nature of the multiple tidal tails observed for galactic satellites like ngc 288 , willman 1 and ngc 2298 @xcite .    finally , we compared sets of streaklines to results from three @xmath0-body models following the same orbits as stated above .",
    "we found that the tidal tails of these computations can be accurately reproduced by a quite simple model , that is when we assume that the stars evaporate from the actual tidal radius , @xmath61 , the star cluster has at the moment when the star escapes .",
    "when the velocity of the escapers is chosen such that they have the same angular velocity as the cluster , the shape of the tidal tails is reproduced best .",
    "this is what we find to be the dominant mode of escape .",
    "however , we have to assume that there is a lower limit , @xmath63 , to the tidal radius . that is , stars escape from @xmath79 ) .",
    "this `` edge '' radius was found to be identical to the tidal radius of the cluster , if it moves on a circular orbit , but was found to decrease with increasing orbital eccentricity at fixed apocentric distance .",
    "for all orbits , the edge radius turned out to be significantly larger than the corresponding perigalactic tidal radius .",
    "it can be interpreted as the minimum radius from which a star can escape from the cluster during one cluster orbit without being re - captured by the cluster in a later orbital phase .",
    "these findings have only been established , however , for systems where the escape of stars is dominated by collisional heating , on galactic orbits with eccentricities up to 0.5 . for much larger eccentricities , or any other system where mass loss may be dominated by tidal heating , modelling the structure of tidal tails may require refinement , as suggested by the collisionless modelling in @xcite . even in the case of a cluster on a circular galactic orbit ,",
    "the notion of a single escape radius is over - simplistic @xcite , but even these authors find that , in the long run , the `` tidal radii '' of stars on prograde , circular and retrograde orbits tend to a single value .",
    "@xcite investigated in detail the same three @xmath0-body models that we discuss in the present paper .",
    "they found that all three models show a radial density profile which barely changes with time . by fitting king profiles @xcite and a new , so - called , kkbh profile",
    ", they showed that the fitted tidal radius does not change with the orbital period , even though eq .",
    "[ eq : rt ] would suggest that the tidal radius should be large at apogalacticon and small at perigalacticon .",
    "for this reason they suggested to rather name such a fitted tidal radius the `` edge '' radius .",
    "furthermore , they found that the fitted edge radius of the model on a circular orbit is close to its true tidal radius of 37 pc , whereas the model with an orbital eccentricity of 0.25 showed an edge radius of about 30 pc , and the one with @xmath80 had a constant edge radius of about 20 pc .",
    "these values lie remarkably close to the values we found by adjusting streaklines to the tidal tails of these @xmath0-body models .",
    "these results suggest that the edge radius is fundamentally connected to the orbit of a star cluster and its mass .",
    "stars preferentially evaporate from the actual tidal radius of the cluster whose lower limit is given by the edge radius .",
    "that is , stars within the edge radius can not escape , whereas stars outside the edge radius get `` eaten away '' by the tide .",
    "this edge radius can be recovered by fitting a king or a kkbh profile to the radial density profile .",
    "it must be mentioned , though , that these findings will most likely only hold for extended , tidally filling clusters ( see @xcite ) with a ratio of half - mass radius to tidal radius larger than approximately 0.1 , since more concentrated clusters may not have properly adapted to the mean tidal field yet .",
    "furthermore , applying our results to dwarf spheroidal galaxies may be complicated by the fact that in such systems the crossing time of stars orbiting at large radii may easily exceed the orbital time of the dwarf galaxy about its host .",
    "instead , @xcite find that in dwarf galaxies which experienced a recent tidal shock an edge develops which moves radially outward with time .",
    "such a dwarf galaxy will lose most of its mass due to tidal stripping rather than through dynamical evaporation .",
    "the scatter in escape conditions of escaping stars would be much higher in this case so that our simple model would not work for the majority of escapers .",
    "thus , no pronounced epicyclic signature would be expected for the tidal tails of such objects .",
    "originally , @xcite suggested that the observed cut - off radius , i.e.  edge radius , of a star cluster on an eccentric cluster orbit is related to its respective perigalactic tidal radius @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the cluster s angular velocity at perigalacticon .",
    "hence , the cut - off radius should be even significantly smaller than the perigalactic tidal radius for high eccentricities .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite and @xcite , both predicting the cut - off radius to be of the order of the perigalactic tidal radius .",
    "in contrast to this , we found the edge radius of clusters on eccentric orbits to be significantly larger than the perigalactic radius .",
    "the reason for this difference is that stars that become unbound at perigalacticon at smaller radii get re - captured by the cluster at a later orbital phase .",
    "finally we conclude that , if sufficient information on a specific globular cluster of the milky way is available , this knowledge on the formation of tidal debris can be used to predict the shape of its tidal tails and the location of its epicyclic overdensities . in a future investigation",
    "we are going to demonstrate this with the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( lane , kpper & heggie , in prep . ) .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that epicyclic motion of stars within tidal tails of star clusters leads to over- and underdensities independent from the cluster orbit about the host galaxy .",
    "therefore substructure in tidal tails is not necessarily due to substructure in the galactic potential like spiral arms , giant molecular clouds or dark - matter subhaloes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
