    "in experiments of 1994 ( transarctic acoustic propagation experiment , tap ) , coherent acoustic transmissions via arctic basin were studied .",
    "it was designed to monitor changes in arctic ocean temperature and sea ice properties .",
    "tap demonstrated that the low frequency ( 19.6-hz ) signals propagated with both sufficiently low loss and high phase stability to support the coherent pulse compression processing and the phase detection of the signals .",
    "these yield time delay measurements an order of magnitude better than what is required to detect the year changes in travel time caused by interannual and longer term changes in arctic ocean temperature . the tap data provided propagation loss measurements to compare with the models to be used for correlating modal scattering losses with sea ice properties for ice monitoring .",
    "the travel times measurements indicated a temperature changes in the arctic atmosphere , which has been confirmed by direct measurement from icebreakers and submarines , demonstrating the utility of acoustic thermometry @xcite .",
    "climatological atmospheric velocity models predict infrasound signals from sources that occur at mid - northern latitudes .",
    "such infrasound data have been used to locate a bolid explosions in space and time . in @xcite authors",
    "analyze travel time picks and use 3-d ray tracing to generate synthetic travel times based on various atmospheric models to show that the seismic network data instead reveal a predominant propagation direction . a sudden stratospheric warming event that reversed",
    "the zonal wind flow explains propagation properties .",
    "a time - dependent , nonlinear , fully compressible , axisymmetric , f - plane , numerical model is used to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves in the mesosphere and thermosphere by intense deep convection in the troposphere @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that major convective storms in the tropics launch acoustic waves into the mesosphere - thermosphere directly above the storm centers .",
    "the principal feature of the overhead acoustic wave field in the period interval of 3 to 5 min is a trapped oscillation below about 80 km altitude with a period of 5 min and a nearly vertically propagating wave with about a 3-min period above this height .",
    "the vertically propagating thermospheric acoustic oscillations are waves propagating upward from the thunderstorm source through the stratosphere - mesosphere .",
    "these predominantly 3-min waves are strongly driven for about 30 min after the storm event and weaken with time thereafter .",
    "the vertically propagating thermospheric acoustic waves may be the source of the f - region 3-min oscillations .",
    "intense acoustic disturbances directly above thunderstorms may also be responsible for localized heating of the thermosphere @xcite .",
    "there is an important ingredient on which a direct problem of sound propagation or inverse problems ( such as acoustic thermometry ) are based .",
    "it is a necessity the proper division of an atmospheric disturbance onto the characteristic types and hence a possibility to formulate a problem of acoustic wave generation propagation and reflection as one of them .",
    "the theoretical and numerical models as e.g. of @xcite describing dynamics of gases and liquids affected by external forces are of great interest in geophysics , meteorology and wave theory @xcite .",
    "the authors believe that the theoretical models are more desirable than the numerical methods , which are time - consumed and require large computer power and special converging and stable numerical methods .",
    "numerical methods , if necessary , are much more economical and successful , if they rely on the reasonable theoretical models .",
    "moreover , some important problems may be resolved only theoretically .",
    "some of these problems are considered in this study . among other ,",
    "they are : how many types of fluid motion exist , what they are and what energy associates with every type of motion .",
    "the external forces make the background of a fluid non - uniform , with background density , temperature and pressure depending on spatial coordinates . that essentially complicates the definition of linear modes ( motions of infinitely small amplitude ) taking place in such non - uniform media @xcite .",
    "the number of roots of dispersion equation , if it is possible to determine them , or branches of possible types of motion , equals number of the conservation equations @xcite,@xcite . even in the simplest case of flow in one dimension",
    ", the dispersion relations may be introduced over all wave - length range only if the background pressure and density depend on the coordinate exponentially [ 1 ] .",
    "anyway , there are three types of motion in one dimension : two acoustic branches and , if the thermal conduction of a fluid is ignored , the stationary ( entropy , non - wave ) mode . in the flows exceeding one dimension , the buoyancy waves appear and interact @xcite,@xcite .    in this study ,",
    "modes of one - dimensional flow are determined by independent on time relations linking hydrodynamic perturbations .",
    "they are fixed for any mode and valid for arbitrary dependence of the background temperature on co - ordinate .",
    "these relations give possibility to distinguish modes analytically at any instant , to conclude about energy of everyone from them and to predict their dynamics .",
    "we will consider volumes of an ideal gas affected by a constant mass force , with variable temperature of the background .",
    "the first results allowing to distinguish modes due to relations of specific perturbations , were obtained relatively to the motion of atmospheric gas affected by gravity in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "fluids different from ideal gases , including liquids , are briefly discussed in concluding remarks .",
    "it is undoubtedly of importance in applications of meteorology and atmospheric dynamics .",
    "the case of an ideal gas with constant temperature is considered in sec.3 .",
    "the examples relating to the linear dependence of the background temperature on vertical co - ordinate in the field of constant gravity force , are discussed in sec.4 .",
    "the equations governing fluid in absence of the first , second viscosity and thermal conduction manifest conservation of momentum , energy and mass .",
    "they are generally nonlinear .",
    "we start from the linearized differential equations in terms of variations of pressure and density , @xmath0 and @xmath1 from hydrodynamically stable stationary functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which are not longer constants : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 the mean flow is absent , so that its velocity equals zero , @xmath7 .",
    "the external force will be described by the gravity acceleration @xmath8 , though it may involve readily other mass forces including non - inertial ones .",
    "the flow of an ideal gas is considered , which internal energy @xmath9 in terms of pressure and density takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the specific heats ratio .",
    "eqs ( 1 ) describe gas motion of infinitely small amplitude .",
    "the background pressure and density follow from the zero order stationary equality , @xmath12 the background quantities supporting the equilibrium distribution of temperature @xmath13 , take the form @xmath14 it is well - established , that distribution of the background temperature is equilibrium if the parameter of static stability @xmath15 is positive @xcite , @xmath16 for some reason , it is convenient to introduce the quantity @xmath17 instead of perturbation in density , @xmath18 the integral @xmath19 is invariant , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 may be infinity .",
    "it readily follows from eqs ( 1)(7 ) , that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a surface circumscriptive the volume @xmath24 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath25 manifests conservation of the total energy of gas , which includes kinetic , barotropic and thermal parts . for @xmath25 to be invariant , there is a certain freedom to establish the boundary conditions at @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 , @xmath0 is any smooth function ( impermeability condition across the boundaries ) , or , for example , @xmath29 .",
    "introducing the new set of variables , @xmath30 one may readily rearrange eqs ( 1 ) into the following set : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "eqs ( 11 ) determine the spectral problem .",
    "the analytical analysis of the dispersion relations and determined by them modes may be proceeded in the case of constant @xmath37 and hence constant @xmath38 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the following matrix equality represents the system ( 11 ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42^t,\\eqno(13)\\ ] ] @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the matrix operator depending on spacial partial derivatives .    the condition of algebraic solvability of eqs ( 12 )",
    "may be established by the fourier transformation using the basis functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the unit matrix , @xmath49 represents the matrix operator @xmath44 in the space of fourier transforms . the dispersion equation ( 14 )",
    "determines five roots of dispersion equation , or dispersion relations , everyone responsible for an especial type of gas motion .",
    "there are four wave modes , denoted by indices @xmath50 , and the entropy mode , marked by @xmath51 : @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 vectors of perturbations @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) correspondent to eigenvalues @xmath57 , form the hilbert space @xmath58 with the scalar product @xmath59 and the invariant @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent a sum of all parts of the eigenvectors , @xmath64 the set @xmath55 form complete set of eigenvectors .",
    "that is true for the self - adjoint boundary conditions .",
    "it may be readily established , that @xmath65 is symmetric in @xmath58 ( @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 the most important physically condition of impermeability at the upper and lower boundaries , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is self - adjoint : @xmath68 .",
    "it is follow from eqs ( 16)(18 ) that @xmath69 may be decomposed in to specific energies , @xmath70 .",
    "in one dimension ( @xmath71 ) and constant @xmath37 , the dispersion relations ( 15 ) determine three modes , or , in the other words , possible motions in the gas .",
    "two of them are acoustic , describing different direction of sound propagation , and the last one is stationary , or entropy mode .",
    "it is responsible for stationary variations in pressure and density which result in stationary change in the gas temperature . in the absence of mass force",
    ", this mode would be isobaric . in the case of variable @xmath37 , the dispersion equation , valid over all wave - length range ,",
    "can not longer be written on , but the modes may be determined by relations linking field perturbations in this case as well . the completeness of the set of eigenvectors allow to represent the total vector of perturbations as a sum of acoustic and entropy vectors at any instant , @xmath72 where index @xmath73 denotes summary acoustic vector .",
    "eqs ( 11 ) yield the relation connecting @xmath74 and @xmath75 in both acoustic branches , @xmath76 and the link for the stationary entropy mode , @xmath77 the scalar product of eigenvectors is given by equality @xmath78 the total vector of perturbations is a sum of orthogonal modes @xmath79=\\psi_1(z , t)+\\psi_2(z , t)+\\psi_3(z , t)\\equiv\\psi_a(z , t)+\\psi_0(z , t)=\\eqno(24)\\ ] ] @xmath80+\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\p_0\\\\\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma-2}{2}+\\gamma h(0)\\eta(z)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)p_0\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] excluding @xmath81 from the system ( 24 ) , one obtains the equation describing @xmath82 : @xmath83 its solution consists of that of the homogeneous equation and a partial solution , @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 are determined by @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 uniquely determines @xmath90 and stationary quantities @xmath91 and @xmath81 in accordance to eqs ( 24 ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath93 , @xmath94 is some non - zero constant , and @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , @xmath97 take the following form @xmath98 eqs ( 25)(29 ) allow to distinguish uniquely acoustic and entropy mode in any vector of total perturbations . some simple conclusions",
    "follow immediately from eqs ( 24 ) .      in this case , @xmath99 in illustrations , we take @xmath100 in the form of a gaussian impulse ( a ) and its derivative ( b ) , @xmath101 where @xmath102 denote the characteristic width of the impulse in units @xmath38 and its amplitude",
    ". it would be superfluous to mention , that relations between field perturbations specifying every mode , eqs ( 24 ) , are valid at any instant .",
    "so , in this subsection and two subsections below , we do not determine the time which the samples of perturbations relate to .",
    "for definiteness , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .    * ab *    * fig.1 * excess pressure and entropy in the entropy mode for different @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .      in accordance to eqs",

    "the specific perturbations in pressure for the stationary mode is taken in both forms ( a , b ) as in eq.(31 ) , and the correspondent entropy is given by eq.(30 ) .",
    "perturbation in entropy for sound is @xmath113 , and the excess pressure relates to @xmath114 by means of eq.(32 ) .",

    "the choice of reference quantity in sound ( @xmath114 ) was made due to simplicity of relation linking @xmath90 and @xmath114 for both acoustic branches .",
    "note that in the limit of homogeneous gas ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , but the product @xmath117 remains constant ) , @xmath118 is the squared sound of velocity in the uniform ideal gas ( about the limit look the numerical investigation @xcite ) . in this case , @xmath17 means the quantity proportional to perturbation in the entropy , @xmath119 .",
    "it is identically zero in both acoustic branches and is not longer suitable to be a reference quantity in them . instead of , perturbation in density or in temperature",
    "may be chosen . in order to conclude about velocity of the acoustic mode , the knowledge of relation linking it with @xmath114",
    "is required .",
    "the relations differ in sign for different acoustic modes .",
    "that follows from the conservation system ( 11 ) : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is some integro - differential operator .",
    "it may be concluded from these equalities and eqs ( 24 ) , that if @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the total field is represented by the entropy mode and acoustic field with non - zero velocity @xmath125 ( hence , in general , the non - zero kinetic energy ) .",
    "zero total kinetic energy means inevitably equal perturbations in pressure and entropy of both acoustic branches , @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "the relations ( 24 ) are valid _ at any instant_. in the other words , though perturbations in every quantity varies with time , links inside every mode remain independent on time .    to make approximate evaluations of @xmath122 , one may consider the waveforms which spectrum includes mostly large wavenumbers @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xcite . that allows to expand acoustic eigenvalues in the taylor series and",
    "do obtain finally relations for every acoustic branch , propagating over the isothermal gas : @xmath130 @xmath131 the simple conclusion from eqs ( 34 ) is that if @xmath132 , the kinetic energy at this instant is zero .",
    "the relations linking @xmath133 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 in a fluid affected by a mass force , are integro - differential .",
    "the exact links of excess pressure , density and velocity in unbounded volumes of gas with constant @xmath38 , are derived exactly with regard to one - dimensional flow by one of the authors in @xcite .",
    "they are valid for an ideal gas or any other fluid . for fluid different from an ideal gas , the equation of state , eq.(2 )",
    "should be corrected @xcite .",
    "that corrects also dynamic equation governing an excess pressure , the second one from eqs ( 1 ) , and therefore , definition of modes and even definition of @xmath62,@xmath63 and @xmath61 ( eqs ( 10 ) ) .",
    "it was shown in the study @xcite , that in the case of constant @xmath134 , the relations ( 10 ) should be completed by the factor @xmath135 , where @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 follow from the leading - order series of excess internal energy , @xmath139 @xmath140 equals zero only in an ideal gas .",
    "estimations for water at normal conditions result in @xmath141 .",
    "so that , even in a linear fluid flow over the background of constant temperature , the results can not be generalized by common replacing @xmath112 by @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the sound velocity over the fluid without mass force , and @xmath2 denotes the unperturbed internal pressure in it .",
    "illustrations of sec.5 relate to @xmath105 taking values @xmath144 , @xmath51 or @xmath145 . in the model of standard atmosphere , there are some extended domains of almost linear dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath92 : @xmath105 is about @xmath146 over the domain of @xmath92 between @xmath51 and @xmath147 kilometers , @xmath148 between @xmath147 and @xmath149 kilometers and @xmath150 between @xmath151 and @xmath152 kilometers .",
