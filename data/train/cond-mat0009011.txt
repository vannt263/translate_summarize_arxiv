    "in order to analyse the origin and the anisotropy of excitations cp , bd and bbd in terms of phonon based processes , we parameterised the low energy phonon dispersion surfaces , which are still significantly populated under 100 k in ktao@xmath1 .",
    "a more ambitious modelisation has already been performed along high symmetry axis @xcite using the polarisability model @xcite but it requires both substantial computations and the determination of 15 parameters in order to be applied just along the three principal directions .    as the precision of the previous studies were not sufficient for our purpose , we performed new high - resolution inelastic neutron - scattering measurements on in14 at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) , grenoble , france @xcite . by taking into account a 4-dimensional modelisation of the instrumental resolution ellipsoid and of the anisotropic phonon dispersion surfaces , it was possible to measure phonon branches ( figure [ dc ] ) with a typical energy resolution of 0.1 mev .",
    "this enabled a direct comparison of the soft mode energy ( 2.6 mev at 10 k ) and damping ( 0.07 mev at 10 k ) with hyper raman results near bz centre @xcite .",
    "some off - principal axis experiments were also performed .",
    "acoustic phonon dampings could not be measured , setting a maximum value of about 0.05 mev from instrument resolution .",
    "these brillouin and neutron - scattering measurements , enabled us to apply the vaks parameterisation @xcite on the five lowest phonon modes for temperatures below 100 k , in the whole central part of bz ( @xmath8 < 0.2 rlu ) where phonon dispersion surfaces are significantly populated @xcite .",
    "such a model requires the determination of only 8 parameters , 4 of which can be measured directly by mean of light - scattering .",
    "the resulting curves along high symmetry axes are shown in figure [ dc ] .",
    "as presented in figure [ spectr+d2p]-a , transverse phonon dispersion surfaces are quite anisotropic , and show deep _ valleys _ ( low energy and group velocities ) , induced by ta - to coupling @xcite , and _ uphill _",
    "( high energy and group velocities ) regions depending on mode propagation and polarisation directions .",
    "hehlen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered several possible explanations for the origin of the new bd .",
    "the most likely one at the time seemed to be the onset of second sound ( 2s ) , a phenomenon independently predicted in qpe by gurevich and tagantsev @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this effect is that the presence of the low frequency to branches enhances _ normal _ ( momentum conservation ) relaxation processes .",
    "this could open the frequency window condition @xmath15 @xcite for the appearance of 2s near bz centre , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the normal and resistive dampings respectively . in ktao@xmath1 , this excitation",
    "is expected to be nearly isotropic in velocity and to couple to acoustic modes .    following a thermodynamical approach , it is possible to evaluate the 2s velocity near bz centre using @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the entropy density , @xmath20 is the heat capacity , and @xmath21 is a density tensor , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "phonons contributing to 2s should have normal dampings higher than the doublet frequency @xmath22 , in order that the window condition is satisfied .",
    "it is possible to evaluate three - phonon normal dampings @xcite through electrostrictive processes @xcite using the phonon dispersion surfaces parameterisation .",
    "numerical computations of this sort indicate that ta dampings are minimal in < 001 > and < 110 > _ valley _ directions , and higher elsewhere , particularly around _",
    "uphill _ regions @xcite .",
    "computations of 2s velocity using the vaks model and the thermalized part of the phonon spectrum give @xmath23 = 1100 @xmath24 200 m / s , in excellent agreement with brillouin scattering measurements of bd speed",
    ". however , it seems difficult to explain the directional dependence of bd ( see section [ brillouin ] and figure [ dbl110 ] ) in terms of 2s .",
    "second sound is the collective mode of phonon density fluctuation processes @xcite . when the window condition is not fulfilled ( @xmath25 )",
    ", non - thermalized phonon can still interact _ via _ two - phonon difference scattering ( tpds ) processes .",
    "following wehner and klein @xcite , the resulting brillouin second order scattering intensity is given by @xcite :      where @xmath27 is 0 and 4 for to and ta contributions respectively .",
    "this expression has been evaluated for model phonon dispersion surfaces in the case of valley , isotrope and uphill shapes ( see figure [ spectr+d2p]-b ) .",
    "it is then possible , in the case of low phonon dampings , to obtain a sharp peak from valley contribution , or a broader quasi - central spectrum from uphill contributions .",
    "the peak or threshold frequency @xmath28 is fixed by the mean group velocity of contributing non - thermalized phonons , and is smaller in valley than uphill .",
    "the tpds spectrum broadens with increasing dampings , and then appears as a broad doublet or central peak , depending on group velocity distribution .",
    "thus , the tpds spectrum is essentially anisotropic .    in this scheme",
    ", the bd low temperature contribution originates from low damping and group velocity valley ta phonons tpds _ i.e. _ for < 001 > and < 110 > propagations ( see figure [ spectr+d2p]-a ) .",
    "the bbd comes from higher damping uphill ta phonons tpds _ i.e. _ for < 110 > and < 111 > propagations , at slightly higher temperatures where those regions are significantly populated .",
    "the bd and bbd contributions disappear when the soft mode energy increases , and the ta - to coupling induced valleys open up . for the to modes , with high dampings ,",
    "a very broad quasi - central peak is expected , corresponding to the cp contribution .",
    "wehner and klein @xcite predicted that in various crystals , including srtio@xmath1 , the integrated intensities of phonon density fluctuation processes ( i.e. 2s or tpds ) could be 10 to 100 times the value given by the landau - placzek ratio .",
    "it is then quite plausible that these intensities become comparable , or even higher than phonon light scattering intensities in ktao@xmath1 , which would thus bring them in agreement with observed intensities .",
    "we have shown that the phonon spectrum and dampings in ktao@xmath1 are consistent with two phonon - density - related scenarios for the appearance of quasi - elastic central peak and doublets .",
    "one scenario is related to temperature waves ( second sound ) involving a part of the spectrum that can be thermalized during the doublet lifetime @xcite .",
    "the other scenario is related to the two - phonon difference scattering of non - thermalized transverse phonons from phonon sheet valleys or uphill regions @xcite .",
    "the position of the sharp doublet bd is consistent with both scenarios whereas the anisotropy of the scattering favours the second one ."
