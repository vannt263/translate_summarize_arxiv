    "in 2006 , the babar collaboration announced @xcite the discovery of a new vector - meson resonance , called @xmath3 , in the initial - state - radiation process @xmath13 , observed in the channel @xmath14 , with the @xmath1 meson decaying to @xmath15 and the @xmath16 to @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "two years later , the bes collaboration confirmed @xcite this resonance , then denoted @xmath19 , in the decay @xmath20\\,\\phi[\\to\\!k^+k^-]\\,f_0(980)[\\to\\!\\pi^+\\pi^-]$ ] . at present , the new state is included in the pdg listings as the @xmath2 @xcite , though not in the summary table , with average mass @xmath21  mev and width @xmath22  mev .",
    "however , these resonance parameters are being strongly challenged by the very recent belle @xcite results on the @xmath19 , alias @xmath2 , observed in the process @xmath23 , yielding @xmath24  mev and @xmath25  mev .    the observation of this highly excited @xmath1-type resonance with ( probably ) modest width , besides the peculiar , seemingly preferential , decay mode @xmath26 , triggered a variety of model explications , most of which proposing exotic solutions .",
    "let us mention first a strangeonium - hybrid ( @xmath27 ) assignment , in the flux - tube as well as the constituent - gluon model @xcite , and a perturbative comparison of @xmath2 decays in these exotic ansatzes with a standard @xmath28 @xmath4 description from both the flux - tube and the @xmath29 model , by the same authors @xcite .",
    "other approaches in terms of exotics , with qcd sum rules , are an @xmath30 tetraquark assignment @xcite , and an analysis @xcite exploring both @xmath30 and @xmath31 configurations . in an effective description based on resonance chiral perturbation theory @xcite , the bulk of the experimental data",
    "is reproduced except for the @xmath2 peak .",
    "this then led to a 3-body faddeev calculation @xcite , with the pair interactions taken from the chiral unitary approach .",
    "indeed , a resonance with parameters reasonably close to those of the @xmath2 is thus generated , though a little bit too narrow .",
    "finally , a review on several puzzling hadron states @xcite mentions the possibility that the @xmath2 arises from @xmath5-wave threshold effects .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall study the possibility that the @xmath2 is a normal excited @xmath1 meson , by coupling a complete confinement spectrum of @xmath4 states to a variety of @xmath5- and @xmath6-wave two - meson channels , composed of pairs of ground - state pseudoscalar ( p ) , vector ( v ) , scalar ( s ) , and axial - vector ( a ) mesons .",
    "the employed formalism is a multichannel generalization of the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) @xcite , which allows for an arbitrary number of confined and scattering channels @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2 the rse is very briefly reviewed and the explicit @xmath11-matrix for the present coupled - channel system is given .",
    "resonance poles and their trajectories are shown in sec .  3 , and model cross sections in sec .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .  5 and discuss possible improvements .",
    "the rse model has been developed for meson - meson scattering in non - exotic channels , whereby the intermediate state is described via an infinite tower of @xmath32-channel @xmath7 states . for the spectrum of the latter , in principle",
    "any confinement potential can be employed , but in practical applications , a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) with constant frequency has been used , with excellent results . for more details and further references ,",
    "see refs.@xcite .    in the present investigation of strangeonium vector mesons , both the @xmath8  and @xmath9  @xmath4 confinement channels are included , to be compared with recent work @xcite restricted to the @xmath8  component only .",
    "we could in principle also consider deviations from ideal mixing , by coupling the corresponding two @xmath33 channels as well , but such fine corrections will be left for possible future studies . for the meson - meson channels , we consider the most relevant combinations of ground - state p , v , s , and a mesons that have nonvanishing coupling to either of the two confinement channels in accordance with the @xmath34 model and the ozi rule .",
    "the resulting 17 channels are listed , with all their relevant quantum numbers , in table  [ mm ] . for the channels containing an @xmath35 or @xmath36 meson , we assume a pseudoscalar mixing angle of @xmath37 , in the flavor basis , though our results are not very sensitive to the precise value .",
    "also note that channels with the same particles but different relative orbital angular momentum @xmath38 or total spin @xmath5 are considered different .",
    "this is only strictly necessary for different @xmath38 , because of the corresponding wave functions , but is also done when @xmath5 is different , for the purpose of clarity .",
    "all relative couplings have been computed using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on overlaps of ho wave functions .",
    "they are given in table  [ mm ] for the lowest recurrences ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "as a matter of fact , we list their squares , which are rational numbers , but given as rounded floating - point numbers in the table , also for clarity s sake . for higher @xmath40 values ,",
    "the couplings fall off very rapidly .",
    "their @xmath40 dependence , for the various sets of decay channels , is presented in table  [ gn ] .",
    "the threshold values in table  [ mm ] are obtained by taking the meson masses given in the pdg tables or listings @xcite , with the exception of the @xmath41 ( alias @xmath42 ) , for which we choose the real part of the pole position from ref .",
    "@xcite , as it lies closer to the world average of @xmath42 masses .",
    "note that we take sharp thresholds , even when ( broad ) resonances are involved .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the conclusions .",
    "finally , we should notice that a number of channels that also couple to @xmath4 vector states according to the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath6-wave channels involving axial - vector mesons as well as some channels with tensor mesons , have not been included in the final calculations presented here .",
    "however , their influence has been tested and turned out to be very modest , due to the corresponding small couplings .",
    "coming now to the explicit expressions for our model , let us first write down the effective meson - meson interaction , which consists of an intermediate - state @xmath32-channel @xmath7 propagator between two quark - antiquark - meson - meson vertex functions for the initial and final state , reading @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 where the rse propagator contains an infinite tower of @xmath32-channel bare @xmath7 states , corresponding to the spectrum of an , in principle , arbitrary confining potential . here , @xmath45 is the discrete energy of the @xmath40-th recurrence in the @xmath4 channel with angular momentum @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the corresponding coupling to the @xmath48-th meson - meson channel .",
    "furthermore , in eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) , @xmath49 is an overall coupling , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the @xmath52-th order spherical bessel function and the ( relativistically defined ) off - shell relative momentum in meson - meson channel @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the spherical bessel function originates in our string - breaking picture of ozi - allowed decay , being just the fourier transform of a spherical delta function of radius @xmath53 .",
    "together with the overall coupling constant @xmath49 , the radius @xmath53 is a freely adjustable parameter here , though its range of allowed values turns out to be quite limited in practice .",
    "the couplings @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ rse ] ) are obtained by multiplying the ones in table  [ mm ] by those in table  [ gn ] , for the corresponding channels . because of the fast decrease of the latter for increasing @xmath40 , practical convergence of the infinite sum in eq .",
    "( [ rse ] ) is achieved by truncating it after 20 terms .    because of the separable form of the effective meson - meson interaction in eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) , the fully off - shell @xmath11-matrix can be solved in closed form with straightforward algebra , resulting in the expression @xmath54^{-1 } \\right\\}_{\\!mj}{j^{j}_{l_{j}}}(p'_ja)\\,\\sqrt{\\mu_jp'_j } \\ ; , \\label{tmat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the spherical hankel function of the first kind , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the on - shell relative momentum and reduced mass in meson - meson channel @xmath59 , respectively , and the matrix @xmath60 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rse ] ) .    .included two - meson channels , their internal and relative angular momenta and spins , couplings squared for @xmath39 , and thresholds .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for properties of listed mesons , except for the @xmath41 , discussed in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    in the states of the confinement spectrum ( indicated by `` conf . '' in the table ) , we see good candidates for the resonances at @xmath61  gev and @xmath62  gev reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and possibly also for the @xmath63 , though our @xmath64 state seems somewhat too light .",
    "note , however , that under the @xmath63 entry @xcite in the pdg listings there is a relatively recent observation @xcite with a mass of @xmath65  mev , which is compatible with our pole at 1602  mev .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary parts of the confinement poles are generally too small , except for the @xmath10 .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the conclusions below . besides the latter poles ,",
    "also two so - called _ continuum _ poles are found , often designated as _",
    "dynamical _ poles , the most conspicuous of which is the one at @xmath12  mev , as the real part is very close to the mass of the @xmath2 as measured by babar @xcite and bes @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the much too large width , even as compared to the belle @xcite value , considerable caution is urged .",
    "also this point will be further discussed in the conclusions .",
    "some words are in place here about our identification of the @xmath8  and @xmath9confinement poles in table  [ poles ] .",
    "the point is that , rigorously speaking , these designations only make sense for pure confinement states and , moreover , without any @xmath8/@xmath9  mixing .",
    "now , in our approach , the very mixing is provided by the coupling to common decay channels .",
    "so for any nonvanishing value of the overall coupling @xmath49 there are no longer pure @xmath8  and @xmath9  states , while for the physical value of @xmath49 the mixing is probably considerable .",
    "moreover , there is no obvious way to tell which pole of a pair originating in a degenerate confinement state stems from either @xmath8  or @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , our identification is partly based on the couplings in table  [ mm ] , which on the whole suggest larger shifts for @xmath8  than for @xmath9 , partly on a comparison with a perturbative approach employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to find poles for small @xmath49 .",
    "the designation _ continuum _ pole becomes clear when plotting a corresponding trajectory as a function of the overall coupling @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ 2170 ] , the first such pole is shown to have an _ increasingly _ large imaginary part for _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath49 , eventually disappearing in the continuum for @xmath66 .",
    "note that the small jump at the important @xmath5-wave @xmath67 threshold is due to a minor threshold discontinuity of the damping function in eq .",
    "( [ damping ] ) for complex momenta .",
    "figure  [ zerothconf ] shows a similar trajectory , but now for the lowest confinement pole , which ends up as the @xmath10 resonance .",
    "notice the large negative mass shift ( @xmath68  mev ) , as well as the way the pole approaches the @xmath69 threshold , which is typical for @xmath6-wave decay channels .",
    "also note that the tiny jump in the trajectory is due to the way relativistic reduced mass is defined below threshold , which in the case of closed channels with highly unequal masses ( @xmath70 here ) requires an intervention to prevent the reduced mass from becoming negative .    in fig .",
    "[ firstconf ] , we depict the trajectories of the @xmath71  and @xmath64  confinement poles .",
    "note that the coupling to decay channels lifts the original degeneracy of the @xmath71  and @xmath64  ho states .",
    "the trajectories of the next pair of confinement poles , i.e. , @xmath72  and @xmath28 , are drawn in fig .",
    "[ secondconf ] .",
    "note the highly nonlinear behavior of the poles , showing the unreliability of perturbative methods to estimate coupled - channel effects .",
    "now we shall show , as mere illustrations , some of the cross sections related to the resonance poles found in the preceding section .    in fig .",
    "[ kk ] , the elastic @xmath6-wave @xmath73 cross section is depicted in the energy region covering the @xmath10 as well as the @xmath71  and @xmath64resonances .",
    "we see that including the @xmath9  @xmath4 channel has the effect of lowering the @xmath71  state , besides the generation of an additional resonance , of course .",
    "this `` repulsion '' between the @xmath8  and @xmath9  poles is also noticed for the @xmath72  and @xmath28  states .",
    "figure  [ kkskk ] shows the relative importance of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 channels in the energy interval 1.51.7  gev , which should be relevant for the @xmath63 .",
    "the plotted quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the elastic @xmath74 and @xmath73 cross sections , which shows that the @xmath74 channel is strongly dominant , except at low energies , because of phase space , and close to the pole at @xmath75  gev , where the two cross sections are comparable .",
    "dominance of the @xmath74 decay mode is reported under the @xmath63 pdg entry @xcite .",
    "turning now to the @xmath2 energy region , we show in fig .",
    "[ f0phi ] the elastic @xmath5- and @xmath76-wave    @xmath14 cross sections .",
    "the effect of the continuum pole at @xmath12  mev is noticeable as a small and very broad enhancement in the @xmath76-wave cross section . in the @xmath5-wave case ,",
    "its effect is completely overwhelmed by the huge cross section at threshold , partly due to the @xmath72  pole not far below .",
    "also quite conspicuous are the here predicted @xmath77  and @xmath78  resonances ( see table  [ poles ] for the respective pole positions ) . of course , all these model",
    "_ elastic _",
    "cross sections have little direct bearing upon the experimentally observed _ production _ cross sections .",
    "the production process of the @xmath2 may be studied with the rse production formalism @xcite , but that lies outside the scope of the present investigation , which focused on the possibility of generating a @xmath2 resonance pole through coupled channels .    finally , in fig .  [ f0phikk ]",
    "we plot the logarithm of the ratios of the elastic @xmath5-wave @xmath14 cross section and the elastic @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath67 cross sections , in the energy interval 2.02.3  gev .",
    "we see that the @xmath5-wave @xmath14 cross section dominates up to about 2.08  gev , but getting overwhelmed first by the ( @xmath6-wave ) @xmath79 channel , and then even more so by the @xmath5-wave @xmath67 channel , right from its threshold at @xmath81  gev upwards . also the @xmath80 channel is becoming more important here . as for the @xmath79 channel",
    ", it gives rise to a final state with two kaons and two pions , i.e. , the same as that for which the @xmath2 was observed .",
    "so the experimental status of the @xmath2 might be improved if one succeeded in identifying and isolating the @xmath82k^*[\\to k\\pi]$ ] decay mode , which should be quite important .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the rse formalism for non - exotic multichannel meson - meson scattering to calculate the resonance spectrum of excited vector @xmath1 mesons , and to find out whether this way the @xmath2 can be generated .",
    "the inclusion of all relevant two - meson channels that couple to the bare @xmath8  and @xmath9  @xmath4 states should guarantee a reasonable description .",
    "thus , several vector @xmath1 resonances are predicted , some of which are good candidates for observed states , while others may correspond to others , undetected so far , but quite plausible in view of observed partner states in the excited @xmath83 spectrum .",
    "finally , a very broad @xmath1-like resonance pole of a dynamical origin is found , with real part very close to that of the @xmath2 , but a much too large imaginary part , so that its interpretation remains uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculated resonances originating in the confinement spectrum are generally too narrow .",
    "these considerations bring us to the main problem of our description , namely the inclusion of sharp thresholds only .",
    "the point is that many of the channels in table  [ mm ] involve highly unstable particles , several of which are broad to very broad resonances themselves .",
    "treating the corresponding thresholds as sharp is clearly an approximation . in particular , the @xmath16 meson included in the @xmath14 channels",
    "is a very pronounced resonance in the coupled @xmath84-@xmath73 system .",
    "this feature is crucial in the three - body calculation of the @xmath2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which indeed produces a clear resonance signal at almost the right energy , and even with a somewhat too _ small _ width .",
    "we believe that in our approach , too , a narrower @xmath2 might be generated , if we could account for the physical width of the @xmath16 meson , and also for the widths of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 resonances in the here included @xmath67 channel .",
    "the reason is that the widths effectively cause these channels to act already below their central thresholds , which will strongly influence poles just underneath .",
    "especially the width of very strongly coupling @xmath67 channel , whose threshold lies only some 25  mev below the real part of the continuum pole at @xmath87  mev , will surely have a very significant effect on this pole s trajectory .",
    "because of the typical behavior of continuum poles , with decreasing width for increasing coupling , we expect that the width of our @xmath2 candidate may thus be reduced .",
    "conversely , including the widths of final - state resonances will probably _ increase _ the widths of the now too narrow excited @xmath1 resonances stemming from the confinement spectrum .",
    "of course , to account for the nonvanishing widths of mesons in the coupled channels is a very difficult problem , since the simple substitution of the here used real masses by the true complex masses will destroy the manifest unitarity of the @xmath5-matrix .",
    "work is in progress to redefine the @xmath5-matrix for such cases , so as to enforce its unitarity by construction .",
