    "neutron stars are one of the most exotic objects in the universe .",
    "matter in their cores is compressed to huge densities ranging from the density of normal nuclear matter , @xmath5 , to an order of magnitude higher  @xcite .",
    "the number of baryons forming a neutron star is in the order of @xmath6 .",
    "understanding properties of matter under such extreme conditions of density ( and pressure ) is still far from complete and represents one of the most important but also challenging problems in modern physics .    strictly speaking ,",
    "neutron stars are associated with two classes of astrophysical objects  @xcite .",
    "pulsars belong to the first class and are generally accepted to be rotating neutron stars .",
    "x - ray sources belong to the second class and some of them are neutron stars on close binary orbit with an ordinary star ( e.g. , her x-1 and vela x-1 )  @xcite . because of their strong gravitational binding neutron stars can rotate very fast  @xcite .",
    "the first millisecond pulsar psr1937 + 214 , spinning at @xmath7  @xcite , was discovered in 1982 , and during the next decade or so almost every year a new one was reported . in the recent years the situation changed considerably with the discovery of an anomalously large population of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters  @xcite , where the density of stars is roughly 1000 times that in the field of the galaxy and which are therefore very favorable sites for formation of rapidly rotating neutron stars which have been spun up by the means of mass accretion from a binary companion .",
    "presently the number of the observed pulsars is close to 2000 , and the detection rate is rather high .    in 2006",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of a very rapid pulsar j1748 - 2446ad , rotating at @xmath8 and thus breaking the previous record ( of @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , even this high rotational frequency is too low to affect the structure of neutron stars with masses above @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "such pulsars belong to the slow - rotation regime since their frequencies are considerably lower than the kepler ( mass - shedding ) frequency @xmath11 .",
    "( the mass - shedding , or kepler , frequency is the highest possible frequency for a star before it starts to shed mass at the equator . )",
    "neutron stars with masses above @xmath10 enter the rapid - rotation regime if their rotational frequencies are higher than @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a recent report by  @xcite suggests that the x - ray transient xte j1739 - 285 contains the most rapid pulsar ever detected rotating at @xmath13 .",
    "this discovery has reawaken the interest in building models of rapidly rotating neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "since neutron stars are objects of extremely condensed matter , the geometry of space - time is considerably altered from that of a flat space .",
    "therefore , the construction of realistic models of neutron stars has to be done in the framework of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) of stellar matter over a very wide range of densities is required for solving the neutron - star structure equations . at present time",
    "the behavior of matter under extreme densities such as those found in the interiors of neutron stars is still highly uncertain and relies upon , often , rather controversial theoretical predictions .",
    "fortunately , heavy - ion reactions provide a unique means to constrain the eos of dense nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratories  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one of the main sources of uncertainty in the stellar matter eos is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite , @xmath14 , which is the difference between the energies of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter . due to its importance for the neutron star structure determining",
    "the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy has been a priority goal for the intermediate energy heavy - ion community .",
    "although extracting the symmetry energy is not an easy task due to the complicated role of the isospin degree of freedom in reaction dynamics , several promising probes of the symmetry energy have been suggested  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "some significant progress have been made recently in determining the density dependence of @xmath15 at subsaturation densities using : ( 1 ) isospin diffusion  @xcite and isoscaling  @xcite in heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies  @xcite , and ( 2 ) sizes of neutron skins in heavy nuclei  @xcite . at supranormal densities ,",
    "a number of potential probes of the symmetry energy have been proposed although there is not much data available yet  @xcite .    while global properties of spherically symmetric static ( non - rotating ) neutron stars have been studied extensively @xcite , properties of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars",
    "have been investigated to lesser extent .",
    "models of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars have been constructed only by several research groups with various degree of approximation ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this paper",
    "we combine recently obtained data on isospin diffusion , information from flow observables , studies of neutron skin data of @xmath0 and other information to constrain global properties of rotating neutron stars .",
    "applying several nucleonic equations of state and the @xmath16 code is available as a public domain program at http://www.gravity.phys.uwm.edu/rns/ ] code developed and made available to the public by nikolaos stergioulas  @xcite , we construct one - parameter 2-d stationary configurations of rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the computation solves the hydrostatic and einstein field equations for mass distributions rotating rigidly under the assumptions of stationary and axial symmetry about the rotational axis , and reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane .",
    "this work is organized in the following way : after the introduction in section 1 , we review briefly the structure equations of both static and rotating neutron stars on section 2 .",
    "our numerical results are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "we conclude with a short summary in section 4 .",
    "in what follows we present a brief review of structure equations of both static and rotating neutron stars . as already mentioned in the introduction neutron stars are objects of extremely compressed matter and therefore proper understanding of their properties requires application of both general relativity and the theories of dense matter , which constitute nuclear and particle physics problem . in this respect neutron stars provide a direct link between two of the frontiers of modern physics - general relativity and strong interactions in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "the connection between both branches of physics is provided by einstein s field equations @xmath17 @xmath18 which couple the einstein curvature tensor , @xmath19 , to the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath20 of stellar matter . in the above equations @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 denote pressure and mass energy density , while @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denote the ricci tensor , the metric tensor , and the ricci scalar curvature respectively  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the tensor @xmath28 contains the eos of stellar matter in the form @xmath29 . in general ,",
    "einstein s field equations and those of the nuclear many - body problem were to be solved simultaneously since the baryons and quarks follow the geodesics of the curved space - time whose geometry , determined by the einstein s field equations , is coupled to the total mass energy density of matter  @xcite . in the case of neutron stars , as for all astrophysical situations for which the long - range gravitational force can be separated from the short - range strong force , the deviation from flat space - time at the length - scale of the strong interactions ( @xmath30 ) is practically zero up to the highest densities achieved in the neutron star interiors .",
    "( this is not to be confused with the global length - scale of neutron stars ( @xmath31 ) for which @xmath32 depending on the star s mass ( in units @xmath33 so that @xmath34 ) . ) in other words , gravity curves space - time only on a macroscopic scale but to a very good approximation leaves it flat on a microscopic scale . to achieve an appreciable curvature on a microscopic level at which the strong interactions dominate the particle dynamics mass densities greater than @xmath35",
    "would be necessary  @xcite . under this circumstances",
    "the problem of constructing models of neutron stars separates into two distinct tasks .",
    "first , the short - range effects of the nuclear forces are described by the principles of many - body nuclear physics in a local inertial frame ( co - moving proper reference frame ) in which space - time is flat .",
    "second , the coupling between the long - range gravitational force and matter is accounted for by solving the general relativistic equations for the gravitational field described by the curvature of space - time , leading to the global structure of stellar configurations .      in the case of",
    "spherically symmetric static ( non - rotating ) stars the metric has the famous schwarzschild form : @xmath36 @xmath37 where the metric functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by : @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42 for a static star einstein s field equations ( eq .",

    "the above equations can be integrated outward until the pressure vanishes , signifying that the stellar edge is reached .",
    "some care should be taken at @xmath52 since , as seen above , the tov equation is singular there .",
    "the point @xmath47 where the pressure vanishes defines the radius of the star and @xmath53 its gravitational mass .    for a given eos",
    ", there is a unique relationship between the stellar mass and the central density @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for a particular eos , there is a unique sequence of stars parameterized by the central density ( or equivalently the central pressure @xmath55 ) .",
    "equations of stellar structure of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars are considerably more complex than those of spherically symmetric stars  @xcite .",
    "these complications arise due to the rotational deformations in rotating stars ( i.e. , flattening at the poles and bulging at the equator ) , which lead to a dependence of the star s metric on the polar coordinate @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , rotation stabilizes the star against gravitational collapse and therefore rotating neuron stars are more massive than static ones .",
    "a larger mass , however , causes greater curvature of space - time .",
    "this renders the metric functions frequency - dependent .",
    "finally , the general relativistic effect of dragging the local inertial frames implies the occurrence of an additional non - diagonal term , @xmath57 , in the metric tensor @xmath24 .",
    "this term imposes a self - consistency condition on the stellar structure equations , since the degree at which the local inertial frames are dragged along by the star , is determined by the initially unknown stellar properties like mass and rotational frequency  @xcite .",
    "here we outline briefly the equations solved by the @xmath16 code .",
    "the coordinates of the stationary , axial symmetric space - time used to model a ( rapidly ) rotating neutron star are defined through a generalization of bardeen s metric  @xcite : @xmath58 where the metric potentials @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the angular velocity of the stellar fluid relative to the local inertial frame , @xmath62 , are functions of the quasi - isotropic radial coordinates , @xmath44 , and the polar angle @xmath56 only .",
    "the matter inside a rigidly rotating star is approximated as a perfect fluid  @xcite , whose energy momentum tensor is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) .",
    "the proper velocity of matter , @xmath63 , relative to the local zero angular momentum observer ( zamo )   is defined as @xmath64 with @xmath65 the angular velocity of a fluid element .",

    "substitution of eq .",
    "( [ eq.13 ] ) into einstein s fields equations projected onto the zamo reference frame gives three elliptic partial differential equations for the metric potentials @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 , and two linear ordinary differential equations for the metric potential @xmath61 .",
    "technically , the elliptic differential equations for the metric functions are converted into integral equations which are then solved iteratively applying green s function approach  @xcite .    from the relativistic equations of motion ,",
    "the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium for a barotropic fluid may be obtained as  : @xmath69,\\ ] ] with @xmath70 the specific enthalpy , @xmath71 the re - scaled pressure , @xmath72 the specific enthalpy at the pole , @xmath73 and @xmath74 the values of the metric potentials at the pole , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 a rotational constant  @xcite .",

    "the eos of symmetric nuclear matter for the mdi interaction is constrained up to five times the normal nuclear matter density by the available data on collective flow in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is introduced in the single - particle potential of the mdi eos to reflect the largely uncertain density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath14 as predicted by various many - body approaches .",
    "since , as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , only equations of state with @xmath84 between -1 and 0 have symmetry energies consistent with the isospin diffusion data and measurements of the skin thickness of @xmath0 , we thus consider only these two limiting cases as boundaries of the possible rotating neutron star models .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to note that the symmetry energy extracted very recently from the isoscaling analyses of heavy - ion reactions is consistent with the mdi calculation using @xmath85 @xcite .",

    "we discuss this further in the next subsection ( 3.2 ) .      .",

    "stability with respect to the mass - shedding from equator implies that at a given gravitational mass the equatorial radius @xmath93 should be smaller than @xmath94 corresponding to the keplerian limit  @xcite . the value of @xmath94 results from the condition that the frequency of a test particle at circular equatorial orbit of radius @xmath94 just above the equator of the actual rotating star is equal to the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "as reported by  @xcite the relation between @xmath95 and @xmath93 at the `` mass - shedding point '' is very well approximated by the expression for the orbital frequency for a test particle orbiting at @xmath96 in the schwarzschild space - time created by a spherical mass . the formula satisfying @xmath97 , represented by the dotted line in figs .",

    "we observe that the range of the allowed masses supported by a given eos for rapidly rotating neutron stars becomes narrower than the one of static configurations .",

    "7 ) for the x=-1 eos the allowed mass range is @xmath102 . since predictions from the x=0 and x=-1 eoss represents the limits of the neutron star models consistent with the nuclear data from terrestrial laboratories , we conclude that the mass of the neutron star in xte j1739 - 285 is between 1.7 and @xmath4 .              finally , we study the effect of ( fast ) rotation on the proton fraction in the star core . in fig .",
    "8 we show the central baryon density ( upper frame ) and central proton fraction ( lower frame ) as a function of the rotational frequency for fixed - mass models .",
    "predictions from both @xmath85 and @xmath103 eoss are shown .",
    "we observe that central density decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "this reduction is more pronounced in heavier neutron stars .",
    "most importantly , we also observe decrease in the proton fraction @xmath104 in the star s core .",
    "we recall that large proton fraction ( above @xmath105 for @xmath106-stars ) leads to fast cooling of neutron stars through direct urca reactions .",
    "our results demonstrate that depending on the stellar mass and rotational frequency , the central proton fraction could , in principle , drop below the threshold for the direct _ nucleonic _ urca channel and thus making the fast cooling in rotating neutron stars impossible .",
    "the masses of the models shown in fig .",
    "8 are chosen so that the proton fraction in stellar core is just above the direct urca limit for the _ static _ configurations , see fig .",
    "9 upper and lower frames .",
    "the stellar sequences in fig .",
    "8 are terminated at the kepler ( mass - shedding ) frequency . in both cases",
    "the central proton fraction drops below the direct urca limit at frequencies lower than that of psr j1748 - 244ad @xcite .",
    "this implies that the fast cooling can be effectively blocked in millisecond pulsars depending on the exact mass and spin rate .",
    "it might also explain why heavy neutron stars ( could ) exhibit slow instead of fast cooling .",
    "for instance , with the @xmath85 eos ( with softer symmetry energy ) for a neutron star of mass approximately @xmath107 , the direct urca channel closes at @xmath108 . on the other hand , with the x=-1 eos ( with stiffer symmetry energy ) the direct urca channel",
    "can close only for low mass neutron stars , in fact only for masses well below the canonical mass of @xmath109 .",
    "this is due to the much stiffer symmetry energy ( see fig .  9 middle frame )",
    "because of which the direct urca threshold ( fig .  9 lower frame ) is reached at much lower densities and stellar masses ( fig .  9 upper frame ) .    before closing the discussion in this section a few comments are in order . in the present study we do not consider `` exotic '' states of matter in neutron stars . on the other hand , due to the rapid rise of the baryon chemical potentials",
    "several other species of particles , such as strange hyperons @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are expected to appear once their mass thresholds are reached  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of hyperonic degrees of freedom lowers the energy - per - particle in the stellar medium and causes more centrally condensed configurations with lower masses and radii .",
    "additionally , hyperons help the condition for _ nucleonic _ direct urca process to be satisfied at lower densities due to the increased proton fraction @xcite , and depending on their exact concentrations could potentially contribute to the fast cooling of the star through _ hyperonic _ direct urca processes @xcite .",
    "these considerations would alter the balance between the curves in fig .",
    "9 and ultimately the results displaced in fig .  8 in favor of the direct urca process , i.e. smaller masses and higher frequencies would be necessary to close the fast cooling channel .",
    "this is due to the fact that the overall impact of ( rapid ) rotation on the neutron star structure is smaller for more centrally condensed models resulting from `` softer '' eoss @xcite .",
    "therefore , for such models there is smaller deviation from properties and structure of static configurations .",
    "in addition , at even higher densities matter is expected to undergo a transition to quark - gluon plasma @xcite , which favors a fast cooling through enhanced nucleonic direct urca and quark direct urca processes ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have studied properties of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars employing four nucleonic eoss .",
    "rapid rotation affects the neutron star structure significantly .",
    "it increases the maximum possible mass up to @xmath112 and increases / decreases the equatorial / polar radius by several kilometers .",
    "our findings , through the application of eoss with constrained symmetry energy by recent nuclear terrestrial laboratory data , allowed us to constrain the mass of the neutron star in xte j1739 - 285 to be between 1.7 and @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , rotation reduces central density and proton fraction in the neutron star core , and depending on the exact stellar mass and rotational frequency could effectively close the fast cooling channel in millisecond pulsars .",
    "this circumstance may have important consequences for both the interpretation of cooling data and the thermal evolution modeling .",
