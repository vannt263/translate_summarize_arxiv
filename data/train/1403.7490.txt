    "with the observation of a standard model - like higgs boson  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking has been significantly enhanced .",
    "the attention of experiments at the lhc now turns to establishing the properties of this new resonance .",
    "the possibility that the resonance is actually a composite bound state remains open , and in this work we study a top partner search in the context of composite higgs scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of such top partners would spectacularly elucidate the mechanism by which the scalar resonance mass is stabilized at the electroweak scale .",
    "although the higgs boson can be a generic composite bound state , we focus on the realization of the higgs boson as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) of the coset @xmath1 , @xmath2 is an approximate global symmetry and @xmath3 is an unbroken subgroup .",
    "we assume partial compositeness @xcite to evade flavour physics constraints  @xcite . here , the standard model ( sm ) fermions obtain masses via mixing with composite bound states from the strongly coupled sector .",
    "since sm fermions arise as admixtures of the elementary and the corresponding composite bound states , there are necessarily accompanying heavy excitations with the same sm quantum numbers , so - called top partners .",
    "they belong to a representation of the unbroken subgroup @xmath3 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we adopt a minimal setup for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume @xmath6 to be a completely composite chiral state and only @xmath7 to be partially composite . in this short article",

    "we focus instead on single production : @xmath26 .",
    "the cross section for single production is smaller than that for pair production at low masses of the top partner .",
    "however , depending on the weak coupling to the top partner , single production can begin to have a larger cross section in the mass - range of 6001000gev  @xcite .",
    "thus , well - designed searches for single production can potentially extend the mass - reach of the lhc experiments .    singlet top partners decay to @xmath0,@xmath27 or @xmath28 in the approximate ratio 2:1:1 respectively , and the significant branching fractions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 have attracted previous attention@xcite . in particular , multi - leptonic final states arising from these decays make for searches with low background , albeit at a relatively low overall signal efficiency . here , we have chosen to focus on the most abundant expected decay : @xmath29 , with subsequent decay of the @xmath30 boson to leptons . trading a clean final state for",
    "a larger signal efficiency can be beneficial for large top partner masses @xcite .",
    "the present experimental limits are weakest for large values of the @xmath31 branching ratio  @xcite . we demonstrate that , by requiring a forward jet and exploiting jet substructure to suppress backgrounds from top - quark production , this relatively neglected channel can become a promising one for discovery of single top - partner production at the lhc .",

    "the @xmath33 background is also suppressed by requiring that the large - radius jet have @xmath65gev and mass @xmath66gev .",
    "the latter requirement exploits the fact that high @xmath67 large - radius jets in @xmath33 tend to have a genuinely large mass since they contain at least two decay products from @xmath68 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : illustration ] . to ensure that the lepton is not within the active area of the large - radius jet , it is required that @xmath69 .",
    "the expected isolation of the b - tagged jet from the @xmath12 decay can be exploited further by vetoing events with extra central jets ( those with @xmath70 ) above a certain  threshold .",
    "theoretical uncertainties when vetoing extra jets decrease for higher thresholds , i.e. the resummation of contributions @xmath71 becomes increasingly important for lower cut - off scales @xcite .",
    "hence , this cut was optimized by looking for both the largest @xmath72 and the largest jet  threshold .",
    "the optimal threshold was found to be 75gev .",
    "finally , events must have at least one jet with  @xmath52 35gev and @xmath54 , consistent with the single top partner production mechanism .    in table",
    "[ tab : cutflow ] , the number of expected events for 20fb@xmath32 integrated luminosity at the 8tev and 14tev lhc is shown at the preselection stage , after requiring the central jet - veto , and after the final selection .",

    "the addition of the forward jet requirement leads to modest improvements in @xmath72 but more than doubles @xmath73 , it can thus be very useful in the case of large experimental uncertainties on the background normalization .    to search for @xmath12 production ,",

    "it was found that although the @xmath75 for both analyses is comparable , our approach accepts between 50% and 70% more events .",
    "this will either allow for additional cuts to purify the final state or in an improved reach of the resonance mass or smaller production cross section .",
    "in order to estimate whether a singly - produced top partner can be excluded with data collected at the lhc , we use a binned log - likelihood hypothesis test as described in ref .",
    "the results of this procedure , as a function of integrated luminosity for 8tev and 14tev lhc data , are presented in figure  [ fig : cls700at8 ] , which shows the confidence level at which single production of a 700gev @xmath12 quark can be excluded in the absence of signal .",
    "these results are shown both before and after the forward - jet requirement and for different assumed levels of systematic uncertainty on the backgrounds : 0% , 5% and 10% .",
    "it can be seen that the sensitivity is improved by the forward - jet requirement and that the full selection is sufficient to exclude the single - top partner production using 8tev data even for the most pessimistic assumed systematic uncertainty .",
    "although this systematic treatment is rather simplistic we expect the search strategy to retain sufficient sensitivity to exclude the 700gev @xmath12 if deployed in a real experimental analysis . for 14tev data ,",
    "the exclusion of the full 8tev data set is already surpassed at an integrated luminosity of 5@xmath76 .",
    "this is the first study to demonstrate a simple and feasible strategy for discovering single production of a top partner in the @xmath29 channel .",
    "the study shows that use of a forward jet and the requirement of a low - mass central large - radius jet and central jet veto are powerful tools for rejecting the sm background processes whilst retaining acceptable signal efficiency .",
    "this analysis is indicative that single production of 700gev top partners could be excluded already at the 8tev lhc .",
    "the mass reach of searches at higher - energy lhc running is likely to be significantly extended .",
    "this study considers @xmath12 production within a specific composite higgs scenario .",
    "however , the analysis is generic and its applicability to top partner searches in other models can be inferred from the production cross sections in our chosen model and from the exclusion limits shown in figure .  [",
    "fig : cls700at8 ] .",
    "we reserve study of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for a future work , noting that in most searches the extra efficiency in a dominant decay channel outweigh signal purity in the selected sample .",
