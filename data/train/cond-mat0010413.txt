    "superconductors attached to normal metals tend to export aspects of their anomalous properties into the adjacent normal metal region . termed the proximity effect",
    ", this tendency manifests itself in phenomena such as the josephson effects , anomalous charge and thermal transport coefficients , and altered thermodynamic properties ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for extensive reviews ) .",
    "all these effects find their common origin in the fact that a superconductor pairing field amplitude may penetrate deeply into the normal metal region , before decaying due to the absence of attractive interaction mechanisms .",
    "perhaps the most direct manifestation of the presence of a finite pairing field amplitude in a normal metal adjacent to a superconductor is a massive suppression of the single particle density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this phenomenon , first noticed almost forty years ago , has a long history of research .",
    "beginning with a classic paper of de gennes and saint - james@xcite , the normal metal dos of a wide family of superconductor  normal - metal hybrid systems ( sn - systems ) has been investigated . among these are superconductors coated with normal metal thin films , both clean and disordered@xcite , bulk diffusive compounds in contact with superconductor terminals @xcite and various types of sn quantum dot structures@xcite .",
    "in general the _ quantitative _ functional form of the energy dependent dos , @xmath1 , of any of these systems depends on the system category , and on a number of relevant material parameters .",
    "interestingly , however , a simple ordering principle exists , as first pointed out by melsen _",
    "et al_.@xcite , according to which the _ qualitative _ structure of the dos falls into one of only two different categories : for systems whose normal compound is _ integrable _  in the sense that the dynamics of the single particle degrees of freedom becomes integrable in the classical limit ",
    "the dos vanishes in a close to linear fashion@xcite as the excitation energy @xmath2 approaches zero . of course , due to the inevitable presence of imperfections , truly integrable systems in condensed matter physics do not exist .",
    "however , a number of systems , e.g. thin clean metallic films , come reasonably close to the integrable limit implying that the proximity dos obeys a continuously decreasing behavior down to very small excitation energies @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the dos of genuinely _ chaotic _ systems  significantly disordered systems or chaotic quantum dot structures  is gapped : @xmath1 falls to zero at some _ finite _ threshold energy @xmath3 . for energy values @xmath4 smaller than @xmath3 , the dos is strictly vanishing .    beyond its practical relevance in the physics of sn systems ,",
    "this twofold categorization scheme is of noticeable conceptual interest .",
    "indeed , the observation that a quantity as elementary as the single particle dos of may serve as an indicator sharply discriminating between integrable and chaotic dynamics has led to a wave of interest in the interplay between superconductor correlations and quantum chaotic dynamics@xcite . unfortunately , the established tools of theoretical mesoscopic superconductivity  quasiclassical green function methods and diagrammatic techniques",
    " are not straightforwardly applicable to clean chaotic sn structures . as an alternative to direct numerical analyses ,",
    "an approach based on classical path counting , augmented by a bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , has become popular . referring to a more substantial discussion to below",
    ", we here merely note that the bohr - sommerfeld ( bs ) approach readily produces a massive suppression of the low energy dos of chaotic systems@xcite ( as compared to the integrable case . ) furthermore , the energetic extension of the depletion region turns out to be in good accord with the results obtained by direct diagonalization@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the bs quantization scheme represents a comparatively simple and widely applicable tool for exploring the dos of sn systems .",
    "there is , however , one key feature of the dos gap that is missed by the bs - scheme : for chaotic systems the gap tends to be _ hard _ ( in the sense that @xmath1 strictly vanishes for energies @xmath5 . ) hard gaps are found for a wide class of chaotic sn systems : for the particular case of diffusive sn systems , the structure of a hard gap has been obtained analytically by quasiclassical methods@xcite . a numerical study by pilgram _",
    "et al._@xcite has shown that the gap of weakly disordered systems , i.e. systems whose spatial extent is smaller than the elastic mean free path , is also hard ( within , of course , the numerical accuracy ) .",
    "the same applies to the numerically obtained dos profiles of systems with smooth chaotic boundary scattering displayed in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , chaotic systems that are completely ergodic , in the sense that their quantum mechanics can be modelled by random matrix theory , also exhibit a hard gap@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the very construction of the bs scheme implies that it categorically produces a _ finite _ ( albeit small ) dos at non - zero energies@xcite .",
    "that no gap is seen has to do with the fact that the the bs approach does not fully account for the quantum mechanical nature of the quasi - particle propagation in an sn environment .",
    "more specifically , the elimination of _ all _ states below a certain threshold energy is caused by mechanisms of quantum diffraction similar to those responsible for weak localization corrections in normal metals .",
    "the essential _ difference _ to the weak localization processes operative in normal mesoscopic systems is that diffraction processes in sn systems are not small .",
    "indeed it is one of the main objectives of the present paper to show that at low enough energies these ` corrections ' diverge and that a non - perturbative treatment is needed to correctly obtain the gapped dos .",
    "qualitatively , the results of our analysis may be summarized as follows : in chaotic sn systems , there are at least two different time scales that are of relevance for the low energy dos .",
    "the first is the average classical time @xmath6 it takes to establish contact with the superconductor .",
    "this scale can be set by be the diffusion time time through an extended disordered system , the inverse tunneling rate through a nearly insulating superconductor normal metal interface , or the average ballistic time of flight through a clean quantum dot .",
    "the second time scale is , in general , of quantum mechanical nature , and is the time @xmath7 a minimal wave package takes to lose memory of its classical initial conditions . in a medium with hard ( @xmath8-wave ) scatterers , @xmath7 will coincide with the classical scattering time @xmath9 . in systems with smooth scattering potentials  no matter whether disordered or clean ",
    "@xmath7 is determined by the ehrenfest time @xmath10@xcite , that is to be discussed extensively below . for the structure of the low energy dos , the larger of these two timescales is of foremost relevance .",
    "for example , in a typical diffusive system with hard impurities , the scattering time is much shorter than both the diffusion time and the tunneling time into the superconductor . in this case ,",
    "@xmath11 and the parametric scale determining the gap edge@xcite is @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    "the focus will be on the complementary class of systems with @xmath13 .",
    "we will begin by considering the prototypical class of ballistic systems weakly polluted by some @xmath8-wave impurities and well coupled to a superconductor . for such systems the scattering time is larger than the ballistic time of flight ( and the tunneling time to the superconductor ) and the above condition is met . operating within a synthesis of the quasiclassical formalism and the ballistic non - linear @xmath0-model@xcite , we will identify the relevant quantum diffraction processes , and show how these contributions lead to a vanishing of the dos for energies @xmath14 .",
    "building on the insight gained in this analysis , we will then proceed to the more complex problem of clean chaotic systems with smooth potentials . in this case , the relevant corrections to the classical picture emerge from an interplay of quantum wave packet spreading and the exponential trajectory divergence inherent to chaotic dynamics .",
    "the characteristic time scale for these processes is the aforementioned ehrenfest time .",
    "below we will demonstrate that the ehrenfest time is the relevant energy scale for the dos of chaotic systems with smooth scattering .",
    "it should be mentioned right away that the quantitative parts of this part of the analysis will include certain assumptions and , therefore , do not attain the status of a rigorous calculation .",
    "further , our formalism is not capable of exploring structures in the close vicinity of the estimated gap edge @xmath15 .",
    "notwithstanding these deficiencies , our analysis demonstrates the suppression of the dos below its semiclassically estimated value .",
    "although we can not mathematically prove that this quantum suppression mechanism produces a hard gap , the close structural analogy with the hard scattering problem makes us believe that this is the case .",
    "that a hard gap of the order of the inverse ehrenfest time should be generated has already been conjectured by lodder and nazarov@xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that the phrase hard gap , as used in this paper , needs some qualification : refined analysis of the spectral structure of diffusive andreev systems has shown the existence of a tail below the quasiclassical gap edge@xcite that is exponentially small in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimensionless conductance of the normal component of the system .",
    "similar contributions have been indentified in billiards with randomly fluctuating geometry@xcite . in diffusive systems ,",
    "the formation of these anomalous ` tail ' states is due to exponentially rare potential configurations which lead to an effective decoupling of the superconductor and normal metal@xcite .",
    "an interesting question , not addressed in the present paper , is whether similar states exist in clean chaotic environments .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that tail state formation is a mechanism conceptually independent from the quantum diffractive suppression of the semiclassical results discussed in this paper .",
    "finally , let us mention that much of the conceptual ground on which our analysis of the dos in chaotic systems with smooth boundaries is based was laid in a seminal paper by aleiner and larkin@xcite ( al ) . in this work the fundamental importance of the ehrenfest time for the formation of weak localization corrections in normal chaotic systems",
    "was realized and substantiated .",
    "many of the ideas first formulated by al have been included in our analysis of the superconductor problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : qualitative ] , we discuss some general physics associated with andreev reflection in sn structures , introduce the bs approach and discuss the role of quantum diffraction processes in establishing the gap in the spectrum of the normal region . in section [ sec : qc ]",
    "we discuss how the bs approach may be recovered from the quasiclassical eilenberger equation in the diffractionless limit , and establish a simple trial solution of the quasiclassical equations in the presence of a collision operator . in section [ sec : sigma ] we introduce a functional integral formulation for the disordered green function of an sn system in terms of a ballistic sigma - model . in section [ sec : ballistic_box ] we show how this formalism may be applied to determine the spectrum of a sn system with bulk , ballistic @xmath8-wave disorder , and establish the presence of a hard gap of the order of the inverse scattering time . in section [ sec : clean_chaotic ] we turn to the study of the dos in clean chaotic sn systems , in the presence of a smooth scattering potential , and discuss the appearance of the inverse ehrenfest time in the structure of the dos .",
    "section [ sec : discuss ] concludes with a discussion and summary .",
    "the basic microscopic mechanism of coupling between a superconductor and an adjacent normal metal is andreev reflection@xcite : a normal metal electron impingent on the superconductor interface is converted into a hole ( charge balance being restored by the formation of a superconductor cooper pair ) which is reflected back into the normal metal .",
    "this type of scattering has a number of peculiar properties which are at the root of the formation of the dos gap and which are summarized below for later reference :    * andreev reflection is a retro - reflection , i.e. the hole is essentially reflected back into the path of the incident electron where * there is a slight angular mismatch set by the excitation energy @xmath2 of the electron above the fermi energy @xmath18 . * for an electron of energy @xmath2 , the reflected hole has energy @xmath19 . *",
    "the hole acquires a scattering phase , which takes the value of @xmath20 ( for an excitation energy @xmath2 far below the superconducting gap ) , where @xmath21 is the value of the superconducting order parameter at the point of incidence .    from these properties , the origin of the dos suppression in normal",
    "metals adjacent to superconductors may be readily understood .",
    "assume that an electron of some small excitation energy @xmath2 is injected somewhere into the normal metal ( at the beginning of the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : proximity_mechanism ] say . )",
    "the electron will travel along some path @xmath22 in the normal metal and at some point hit the superconductor where it is converted into a hole .",
    "the hole then propagates approximately ( up to the above mentioned angular mismatch ) back along the path @xmath22 ( dotted line in fig .  [ fig : proximity_mechanism ] ) and eventually arrives in the vicinity of the point of injection .",
    "seen as a whole , this process amounts to the formation of a local net pair amplitude @xmath23 , i.e. an amplitude for the creation of an electron and an annihilation of a hole , in the normal metal .",
    "importantly , this induced cooper pair amplitude is not weighted by rapidly fluctuating quantum mechanical phases . to understand this point , notice that the quantum phase of the incident electron is essentially given by the classical action @xmath24 for traversal along @xmath22 .",
    "the action of the andreev reflected hole ( a missing electron ) is given by @xmath25 .",
    "these two contributions largely cancel against each other , implying that a slowly fluctuating net amplitude obtains .",
    "unitarity implies that the formation of a non - vanishing cooper pair amplitude @xmath26 must be compensated for by a diminished normal state amplitude @xmath27 or , in other words , by a diminished local single particle density of states ( see below for a more precise phrasing of this argument . )",
    "it is also clear that this suppression mechanism can only be effective for small energies @xmath2 , and for spatial regions not too distant from the superconductor : for increasing @xmath2 or , equivalently , increasing length of the characteristic paths @xmath22 , the action difference @xmath28 increases , electron and hole run out of phase and the induced pair amplitude randomizes to zero .",
    "= 2.5 in    this mechanism of ` action cancellation ' is the first of two basic physical principles determining the phenomenology of the proximity effect .",
    "it not only explains the formation of a pair amplitude but also the well known sensitivity of the dos suppression to the classical integrability properties of the system .",
    "this latter point is most easily understood within the bohr - sommerfeld approach to the problem .",
    "the bs approach is based on the condition that the classical action of any closed trajectory traced out by the constituent particles of the system be an integer multiple of @xmath29 .",
    "the generic topology of closed trajectories of an sn - system is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bohr_sommerfeld_idea_ii ] : for sufficiently small energies , @xmath2 , an electron / hole trajectory encompassing two andreev events closes into itself .",
    "the total action of such a trajectory is given by @xmath30 where the term @xmath31 is due to the andreev scattering phase shift @xmath32@xcite .",
    "expanding @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the time of traversal of @xmath22 , one obtains the condition @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an integer .",
    "this condition implies that for small @xmath2 the structure of the dos is determined by the distribution @xmath37 of classical paths of large length @xmath38 .",
    "( see refs.@xcite for the precise formulation of the bs evaluated dos . ) for classically integrable and classically chaotic systems , respectively , these distributions are qualitatively different .",
    "more specifically , for open chaotic systems , @xmath39 is exponentially small ( where @xmath40 is the escape time , see section [ sec : qc ] ) whereas for open integrable systems @xmath37 decays only algebraically .",
    "( here the attribute ` open ' means that we are dealing with systems that are connected to outside leads . )",
    "the exponential rareness of long trajectories provides the bs explanation@xcite for the smallness of the low energy dos in chaotic systems .",
    "= 2.5 in    notice , however , that irrespective of the structure of the system , there will _ always _ be some finite probability @xmath41 of finding trajectories of length @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , although the bs prediction for the dos may be small , it will _ never _ be strictly vanishing ( for any finite @xmath2 . ) for chaotic systems , this is in contradiction with the results obtained by other methods . specifically , for diffusive metallic systems@xcite , weakly disordered ballistic systems@xcite , and zero - dimensional quantum dot type systems@xcite a true dos gap ( strictly vanishing dos for small energies ) has been obtained by quasi - classical , numerical , and random - matrix methods , respectively .    what is the reason for the discrepancy between these results and the bs approach ?",
    "the answer is that the latter does not account for the second key mechanism relevant for the physics of the proximity effect , _ quantum diffraction _ :",
    "the discussion above was based on a representation of transition amplitudes in terms of idealized classical trajectories .",
    "however , in a quantum system the uncertainty principle imposes an upper cutoff @xmath43 on the phase space resolution . in practical terms",
    "this means that the propagation along the trajectories entering the bs counting scheme must be interpreted as a caricature of the propagation of quantum minimal wave packets .",
    "the transverse spreading of these packets is at least of the order of the fermi wave length @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : diffraction ] ) .    whereas in integrable systems",
    "this quantum spreading is of no real concern , its consequences in chaotic systems are profound .",
    "the existence of a globally positive liapunov exponent @xmath45 entails that a microscopic initial uncertainty of @xmath46 increases exponentially @xmath47 and , after a time @xmath48 , reaches the scale @xmath49 of the macroscopic geometry of the system . on time scales beyond this so - called ehrenfest time , a classification scheme based on classical trajectories becomes meaningless .",
    "the consequences of this spreading of minimal wave packages have been explored in al . in that paper",
    "a mechanism was discussed by which the spreading leads to the formation of weak localization type quantum corrections to the classical ( drude ) conductance of chaotic systems : in the terminology of semiclassics , two initially close trajectories split up but eventually recombine to give an overall phase - insensitive weak localization correction .",
    "a similar mechanism affects the mean dos of sn systems .",
    "however , unlike the weak localization corrections to the normal conductance  generally a small correction to a large classical background  quantum diffraction in chaotic sn systems is of vital relevance for even the leading order , _ qualitative _ structure of the dos .",
    "in particular , it is responsible for the strict vanishing of @xmath1 below a certain threshold energy .",
    "= 2.0 in    for a particular system class , such as diffuse disordered systems , the effect of these quantum contributions can be investigated in quantitative detail .",
    "the idea is to compare the trajectory oriented picture outlined above with quantitative solutions obtained by other methods .",
    "indeed , the mean dos of of a large variety of sn systems with diffusive n compounds has been obtained by solving the quasiclassical usadel equations@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the usadel equations are second order nonlinear differential equations for the average green function of the system .",
    "they are obtained by a quasiclassical expansion of the microscopic gorkov equations , with self consistent account for the ( quantum ) scattering off impurities . solving these equations",
    "it has been found that for systems with an n region of finite extension @xmath50 , the dos profile universally contains a hard gap of the type schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_dos ] .",
    "we next address the question of how this phenomenon can be reconciled with the semiclassical picture discussed above .",
    "= 2.0 in    for concreteness , let us consider a diffusive system in the quantum dot regime , i.e. a regime where the thouless energy @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the diffusion constant ) is the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "( the discussion can be adapted straightforwardly to other types of system configurations . ) in this case , the usadel equation is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath53 , where @xmath22 is an energy scale representing the coupling strength to the superconductor .",
    "although the parameter @xmath54 need not be small , it is nevertheless instructive to expand the usadel equation in @xmath54 ; not to obtain quantitative results , but rather to understand the basic physical mechanism responsible for the buildup of the gapped dos . referring to ref.@xcite for a more detailed discussion we here merely sketch the qualitative picture .",
    "the linearity of @xmath54 in both the coupling to the superconductor and in @xmath55 means that each power of this parameter corresponds to a single andreev scattering event , coupled to a diffusion mode@xcite .",
    "the diffusion mode describes the coherent propagation of a particle and a hole through a diffusive background ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hikami ] , right inset ) , i.e. it is the diffusive implementation of the interfering particle / hole amplitudes discussed above .",
    "a cartoon of the correction to the dos of the lowest order in @xmath54 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hikami ] , right .",
    "technically , this correction is described by a single diffusive ladder diagram with two andreev scattering vertices@xcite . however , as our present discussion serves a purely qualitative purpose , we are not going to elaborate on the diagrammatic interpretation any further .",
    "the only thing to be kept in mind is that a perturbative semiclassical / diagrammatic approach to calculating the dos amounts to an expansion in powers of the parameter @xmath54 .    already at the next to leading order in @xmath54 contributions of a different topology",
    "appear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hikami ] , center ) .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these corrections is that they contain ` junction ' points at which a pair of interfering particle / hole amplitudes splits up ( but later recombines to form an overall phase coherent correction ) . these corrections    * are _ not _ included in a semiclassical approach based on a classification in terms of purely classical trajectories , and * are structurally similar to the weak localization corrections of normal metals .",
    "in fact , the basic junction region ( left inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : hikami ] ) is a real space representation of what in the context of disordered systems is called a hikami box . within diagrammatic approaches",
    "these objects appear as vertices in the diagrams describing metallic weak localization . * finally , the diffractive splitting of a coherent particle / hole amplitude is a process that does not hinge on the diffusivity of the medium , but merely on the chaoticity of the underlying dynamics .",
    "this point will be discussed in great detail in section [ sec : clean_chaotic ] below .",
    "the main difference to standard weak localization is that the dos ` corrections ' depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hikami ] are not small .",
    "in fact each additional junction introduces two more powers of @xmath54 , and this parameter can assume arbitrary values . as @xmath2 is lowered and @xmath56 , a situation arises where diffraction processes of infinite order have to be taken into account , a task which can clearly can not be accomplished within a semiclassical trajectory oriented approach .",
    "in fact it turns out that for @xmath57 expansions in terms of trajectories ( diagrams ) do not even converge in principle .    to understand the origin of the problem , it is instructive to compare the semiclassical expansion with the explicit solution of the usadel equation . for the quantum dot type system presently under consideration , the quasiclassical expression of the dos@xcite",
    "is given by the simple expression , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bare metallic density of states ( in the absence of a superconductor ) .",
    "for our purposes , the most important feature of this expression is its bcs type essential singularity at @xmath60 .",
    "the structure of this singularity implies that ( a ) @xmath60 marks the dos gap , for ( b ) values @xmath61 the dos strictly vanishes and ( c ) the gap region @xmath61 is out of reach of a semiclassical / diagrammatic perturbative expansion centered around the metallic limit @xmath62 . for other types of diffusive systems ,",
    "the relevant control parameter may be a different one .",
    "also the analytical structure of the quasiclassical dos will in general be way more complicated than the expression above@xcite",
    ". however the three points ( a)-(c ) remain generally valid .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we will try to explore to what extent these structures generalize from diffusive to more general system classes .",
    "this analysis will be formulated within a hybrid formalism comprising quasiclassical green function methods and elements of the supersymmetry approach to disordered systems .",
    "the relevant theoretical background material is reviewed in the next two sections .",
    "to promote the discussion of the previous section to a more quantitative level , we start out from the eilenberger equation@xcite .",
    "while the eilenberger equation may be written in a general form that describes either point - like or long - ranged scatterers , we focus in this section on its application to systems with hard boundaries and weakly disordered by point - like scatterers ( ` disordered billiards ' ) .",

    "the fact that for lower energies the solutions of the eilenberger equation undergo a rotation towards the bulk superconductor configuration ( cf .",
    "appendix [ sec : ee ] ) implies that the bs approach qualitatively overestimates the low energy dos of chaotic systems .",
    "in this paper we have discussed various physical mechanisms relevant to the phenomenology of the proximity effect in chaotic sn - systems . considering systems where chaotic dynamics is induced by a weak amount of point - like impurities as a test case , we have demonstrated that ( a ) the existence of a hard gap in the dos is directly related to an essential singularity in the quasiclassical equations for the green function and ( b ) that these singularities can be interpreted semiclassically as a non - perturbative accumulation of quantum interference processes akin to weak localization corrections in normal metals .",
    "these contributions are effectively summed up in the solutions of the quasiclassical equations .",
    "although closed solutions can be obtained only in exceptional cases ( for example in the excessively investigated case of systems with diffusive dynamics ) we have shown that the strict vanishing of the dos for low energies follows from combining elements of quasiclassics with the formalism of the ballistic @xmath0-model .",
    "while all perturbative corrections to the dos vanish below the gap , we have remarked that exponentially small contributions due to tail states are not ruled out by our analysis , but remain beyond the scope of this work .    turning to the far more complex case of _ clean _ chaotic systems we have discussed various difficulties obstructing the construction of quantitative analytical approaches .",
    "the perhaps most fundamental problem is that the assumption of a spatially continuous green function underlying , for example , the quasiclassical formalism fails ( due to the singular distribution of the phase space eigenfunctions of the liouville operator . ) in principle one may evade this difficulty by averaging the theory over some set of external parameters .",
    "structure and strength of a minimum set of averaging parameters needed to ensure continuity are not known at present . however , taking a pragmatic point of view and _ assuming _ continuity of the green function , it can be demonstrated that for energy scales smaller than the inverse of the ehrenfest time , quantum diffraction mechanisms become operative@xcite .",
