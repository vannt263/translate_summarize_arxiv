    "the newman - penrose ( np ) constants @xcite are a set of five complex quantities , defined for asymptotically flat spacetimes with a smooth null infinity , with the remarkable property of being absolutely conserved even in the presence of gravitational radiation .",
    "recently @xcite , @xcite , it has been shown that in a more general setting that of polyhomogeneous spacetimes the np constants are not conserved , but nevertheless , an adequate generalization of them ( logarithmic newman - penrose constants ) can be constructed which are indeed conserved .",
    "polyhomogeneous spacetimes are spacetimes which are expanded asymptotically in terms of combinations of powers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the introduction of this more general kind of expansion carries a drawback : null infinity ( @xmath6 ) is no longer smooth . for more details on these , and other aspects of polyhomogeneity , we refer the reader to references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of the np and logarithmic np constants is still an open question .",
    "the work of interpretation has not been easy for a number of reasons .",
    "one of them is a lack of examples of exact solutions to the field equations representing physically sensible radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "no explicit radiative solution which satisfies all the requirements of asymptotic flatness is known .",
    "the examples one can make use of reduce essentially to the family of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these spacetimes have two commuting killing vectors , one of them axial , and the other one , such that it leaves invariant the origin s null cone .",
    "this family includes , among others , the bonnor - swaminarayan @xcite and the c metric .",
    "bik , hoenselaers & schmidt have given a systematic method of constructing these spacetimes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "boost rotation - symmetric spacetimes describe `` uniformly accelerated particles '' that approach the speed of light asymptotically .",
    "the smoothness of the solution requires the spacetimes to be reflection symmetric @xcite ; therefore at least two particles with opposite acceleration are present , and future null infinity contains at least two singular points .",
    "the null infinity of a boost - rotation symmetric spacetime can be global , in the sense that it admits spherical cuts , but the generators are not complete .",
    "ashtekar & dray @xcite have shown that the c - metric admits a conformal completion such that the cuts of @xmath6 are the 2-sphere @xmath7 .",
    "this example in particular settled the issue of the existence of radiative asymptotically flat solutions to the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "the boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes are usually given in a coordinate system that clearly exhibits their symmetries .",
    "the transformation between this coordinate system and the bondi coordinates used in the asymptotic expansions of the gravitational field has to be given in terms of series .",
    "these expansions are extremely messy , and usually only the leading terms can be calculated explicitly . to add to the problem ,",
    "the coefficients in terms of which the np and logarithmic np constants are defined are found deep into the series expansions . as a curious observation , kinnersley & walker @xcite in a note added in proof mention that the c metric is a counterexample to the claim that all algebraically special spacetimes have zero np constants .",
    "however , no expression for the conserved quantities is given .",
    "bik & schmidt @xcite , starting with a vacuum axially symmetric spacetime , imposed an extra symmetry on the spacetime .",
    "expanding the killing equations in powers of @xmath0 , and solving order by order one finds an asymptotic expression for the new killing field .",
    "the boost - rotation symmetry appears playing a privileged role as the only other symmetry an asymptotically flat axially symmetric radiative spacetime can have .",
    "a generalization of this work for the case of electro - vacuum spacetime has been done recently by bik & pravdov @xcite .",
    "it is clear that if one wants to pose an initial value problem for a spacetime that has a particular symmetry , the initial data can not be arbitrary , for it should satisfy some constraints imposed by the killing vector field .",
    "for instance , if the spacetime is bound to be axisymmetric , the initial data can not depend on @xmath8 . in the analysis by bik & schmidt ,",
    "these constraint equations begin to appear when the expansions are carried to higher orders in @xmath0 . in reference",
    "@xcite , a constraint for the news function was found , and in @xcite another for the mass aspect .    in this article",
    "their approach will be generalized in two ways : first it will not be assumed from the beginning that the spacetime is axially symmetric , and second it will be assumed that the spacetimes can be expanded asymptotically using polyhomogeneous series .",
    "the killing equations will be solved using these expansions , and the constraints for the different quantities of interest will be deduced from the integrability conditions of the killing equations . in particular",
    ", we will be most interested in the constraint on the coefficient of order 6 in @xmath0 of @xmath2 , as it is the one from which the newman - penrose ( and the logarithmic np ) constants are calculated .",
    "as it will be shown , the structure of the constraint equations is very similar to that of the continuity equations of the classical mechanics of continuos media .",
    "this fact will allow us to gain some insight on the behaviour of the solutions to the constraint equations , and put forward a tentative interpretation of the physical mechanisms involved , although it may not be possible to calculate the explicit form of the solutions .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 , some preliminaries are discussed .",
    "these include a brief note on the coordinate system and the null tetrad to be used , the killing equations and their integrability conditions in the np formalism , some comments on the hypothesis of polyhomogeneity , and some remarks on the characteristic initial value that will prove of use on later discussions . in section 3",
    "the killing equations are solved to the first order yielding the asymptotic form of the killing fields compatible with asymptotic flatness .",
    "the case of axial symmetry is analysed .",
    "the result by bik & schmidt @xcite on the privileged role of the boost - rotation symmetry in axisymmetric spacetimes is recovered .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of the constraint equations that can be deduced from the integrability conditions of the killing equations .",
    "the general form of these constraints is discussed , and some general remarks on the behaviour of their solutions are put forward . some emphasis is put on the characteristic curves of the differential equations . the constraints for the leading term of the shear ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the news function ( @xmath10 ) , the mass aspect ( @xmath11 ) and the coefficients @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are calculated and analysed .",
    "the resulting expressions are applied to the particular case of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the final product of this analysis is the constraint equation for the coefficient @xmath15 that gives rise to the np constants . from these constraints , some remarks on the interpretation of these quantities are made .",
    "there are 4 appendices .",
    "appendices a and b discuss the solutions to two partial differential equations that will be used in the body of the article . in appendix c ,",
    "the orbits of the restriction of the killing field to null infinity are studied , and a classification of them is done . finally in appendix d some spin - weighted spherical harmonics are listed for quick reference .",
    "most of the calculations will be done with the np formalism .",
    "the coordinates and tetrad used are the same as the ones described in stewart s book @xcite .",
    "the coordinates @xmath16 are such that @xmath17 is a _ retarded time _ labelling the foliation of the spacetime @xmath18 by null hypersurfaces .",
    "the _ affine parameter _ @xmath19 parametrises the geodesic generators of the null hypersurfaces , and the angular coordinates @xmath20 are such that they are constants along the generators of @xmath6 and along the geodesic generators of the null hypersurfaces . the freedom left in this coordinate construction is : a relabelling of the null hypersurfaces , a different choice of angular coordinates , and a rescaling and setting of the origin for the affine parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the tetrad is constructed so that @xmath21 is tangent to the geodesic generators of the null hypersurfaces ; @xmath22 is future pointing , and orthogonal to the 2-surfaces @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) ; and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 span the tangent space to @xmath25 ( @xmath28 ) . the freedom left in this tetrad construction consists in : a boost @xmath29 , @xmath30 which yields a rescaling of @xmath19 ; and a spin @xmath31 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath32 this tetrad is such that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are real functions .    the freedom left in the construction of the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 gives rise to the notion of _ spin - weighted quantities_. the derivatives @xmath37 and @xmath38 work as raising and lowering for the spin weight of the relevant quantities .",

    "a spin - weighted quantity on the sphere ( @xmath7 ) can be expanded in terms of _ spin - weighted spherical harmonics_. these spherical harmonics are a complete and orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath44 .    when dealing with differential equations that contain the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", the following lemma will be most useful @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath42 is continuous on the sphere and has spin weight @xmath45 .",
    "then if @xmath46 it follows that @xmath47 , and if @xmath48 then @xmath42 is a linear combination of the @xmath49 .",

    ", some conventions will be adopted .",
    "we will refer to the newman - penrose field equations , the bianchi identities and the frame equations in the way they are labeled in stewart s book ( ( a ) to ( r ) , ( ba ) to ( bk ) , and ( fa ) to ( ff ) ) .",

    ".    otherwise stated , it will be assumed that all quantities ( components of the weyl tensor , spin coefficients , tetrad functions , and coefficients of the killing fields ) are polyhomogeneous functions .",
    "we will say that a function is polyhomogeneous if in a neighborhood of @xmath6 it can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a polynomial of degree @xmath54 in @xmath51 , whereas @xmath55 is a function of @xmath56 no dependence on @xmath19 left. let @xmath57 denote the degree of a polynomial . in the example given above , @xmath58 .",

    "one finds the `` minimal '' polyhomogeneous spacetimes , which are those whose logarithmic terms are directly due to non - compliance with the _ outgoing radiation condition_. one has reasons to suspect that these particular group of polyhomogeneous spacetimes are the ones with physical relevance @xcite,@xcite .",

    "( using lemma 1 ) one finds that @xmath112 has to be a linear combination of @xmath113 spherical harmonics : @xmath114 where @xmath115 c. using the properties of spin weighted spherical harmonics one can readily find that    @xmath116    and hence    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is an arbitrary integration function .",
    "the asymptotic form of the killing vector field is therefore    @xmath119    hence , all killing vector fields compatible with asymptotic flatness can be constructed by providing the 3 complex numbers @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and the function @xmath123 .",
    "polyhomogeneity adds nothing new at this order . in the axisymmetric case",

    "this suggests that a similar thing can be done in the general case .",
    "if one lets @xmath124 , then the killing vector field will transform as    @xmath125    in order to remove @xmath126 , one needs to find a solution @xmath127 to the partial differential equation @xmath128 as is shown in the appendix a , it is always possible to construct a @xmath127 that satisfies equation ( [ supert ] ) .",
    "this shows that the function @xmath123 is associated with supertranslational killing vector fields , i.e. fields of the form    @xmath129      in an axially symmetric spacetime , one expects all the quantities to be independent of the coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "this fact constrains the expansions in spherical harmonics of functions over @xmath7 , as the only harmonics that are independent of @xmath8 are those with @xmath130 .",

    "the projection will remain in this plane .",

    "these results are summarized in the following lemma .    for an axially symmetric spacetime , it is possible to choose the tetrad so that @xmath136 , @xmath142 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 are real , and @xmath143 is pure imaginary.under this choice , there will be no spin freedom left .",
    "if the spacetime is axisymmetric ( @xmath146 ) , and happens to possess another killing vector ( @xmath147 ) , then the two killing vector fields will form an abelian algebra @xcite .    if one assumes that the spacetime is axisymmetric , then the coefficients @xmath148 , @xmath88 , @xmath112 and @xmath149 for the other killing vector , @xmath147 are constrained to be @xmath150 @xmath151",

    "hence , bik & schmidt s @xcite result has been recovered .",
    "the resulting vector is known as the boost - rotation killing vector .",
    "as has been seen in the previous section , the expansion of the killing equations to order @xmath92 in @xmath0 yields the asymptotic form of the killing vector field . if one carries the expansions to further orders , one will expect to observe the interaction of the symmetry of the spacetime with the quantities that are initial data at a given null hypersurface @xmath63 through the integrability conditions of the killing equations .",
    "the presence of the killing vector field will require the initial data to satisfy some constraint equations that will be derived from the integrability conditions .",

    "looking at the integrability conditions it is not difficult to see that the generic form of the constraint equations will be :    @xmath159    where @xmath160 and @xmath161 depend on quantities that have been calculated at previous orders in the expansions . a number of observations can be made from this equation .",
    "the constraint equation ( [ generic ] ) is a linear partial differential equation for the ( in principle ) complex quantity @xmath162 .",
    "the domain of the solutions to this equation is at least a piece of @xmath163r@xmath164 .",
    "this fact suggests that one could use separation of variables in order to try to solve the equation when the non - homogeneous term @xmath165 is not present .",
    "hence , let us assume that    @xmath166    substitution into the homogeneous part of equation ( [ generic ] ) yields @xmath167 dividing by @xmath168 , and collecting terms one gets @xmath169 using the classical argument of separation of variables , one sees that the left - hand side depends only on @xmath17 , while the right - hand side depends only on the angular coordinates @xmath170 .",
    "hence each side has to be equal to a constant @xmath171 ( @xmath172 , @xmath173r ) .",

    "there is no mathematical restriction to the values @xmath180 can take , but on physical grounds one would like to restrict them to the first quadrant of the complex plane ( @xmath172 , @xmath181 ) as one expects the `` background '' gravitational field to damp the propagation of gravitational radiation",

    "a general solution for the constraint equation ( [ constraintnews ] ) is given by integrating over the values of the parameter @xmath180 :    @xmath182    another interesting observation on the behaviour of solutions to equation ( [ generic ] ) can be obtained from writing the @xmath183 and @xmath184 operators as ordinary partial derivatives .",

    "hence , we have recovered the results of @xcite .",
    "the next step in our study is to obtain constraint equations for @xmath241 ( the mass aspect of the spacetime ) , and @xmath12 ( the coefficient that give rise to the logarithmic terms in the expansions ) .",

    "once @xmath253 is determined , the coefficient @xmath254 is readily found . using the integrability condition ( i0 ) ( equation([i0 ] ) ) at order 4 in @xmath0 one can easily deduce the constraint equation for @xmath12 ,    @xmath255    in particular the coefficient of the highest @xmath1 power ( @xmath256 ) should satisfy : @xmath257 note that there are no derivatives with respect to the retarded time , as @xmath12 is a constant of motion @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the case of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes , the constraint equation for the mass aspect @xmath253 reduces to the one found by bik & pravdov @xcite :    @xmath258    from appendix b we learn that the homogeneous part of the solution of the previous equation will be of the form @xmath259 .",
    "a discussion of the behaviour of the solutions to the constraint equation , and their relation with the bondi mass of the spacetime can be found in @xcite .",

    "note that for the `` minimal '' polyhomogeneous spacetime there will be two coefficients associated with the quadrupole , the logarithmic one being dominant far away from the source .    as in the previous subsections ,",
    "once the constraint equations have been solved , one can easily find the coefficients @xmath279 and @xmath280 from the killing equations ( k5 ) and ( k6 ) ( equations ( [ k5 ] ) and ( [ k6 ] ) ) at order 2 in @xmath0 : @xmath281 @xmath282 from these equations one can see that @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",

    ".    note that in the `` minimal '' polyhomogeneous case , no source / sink term occurs .",
    "the solution in this case is therefore : @xmath291 where @xmath292 is an arbitrary function of the argument .",
    "now , using the evolution equation for @xmath287 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , one finds that @xmath293 whence @xmath287 will also be a constant of motion for boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes .",
    "hence @xmath294 again one can see that polyhomogeneity in these class of spacetimes gives rise to a local @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we are able to deduce constraint equations for @xmath295 .",

    "we have seen that if an asymptotically flat spacetime polyhomogeneous or not is assumed to have a killing vector field , then using the integrability conditions of the killing equations it is possible to obtain constraints on the different components of the weyl tensor and the news function .",
    "these extra equations together with the evolution equations derived from the bianchi identities suggest the existence , in non - stationary spacetimes , of processes of transformation of multipole moments of a given kind into others of a different class .",
    "unfortunately , this interpretation is done in terms of quantities that can only be defined rigorously for stationary spacetimes .",

    "this gives rise to the following infinite set of linear equations in @xmath327    @xmath328    that in principle can be solved to any desired order , yielding a solution to the equation ( [ betaeqn ] ) .",

    "the structure of this killing vector field is not very complicated , depending only on 3 spherical harmonics .",
    "therefore , it is quite tempting to attempt a study of these orbits .    throughout this article , we have been using the angular coordinates @xmath20 on the cuts of @xmath6 , however the study of the orbits is more easily done using the stereographic coordinates ( @xmath350 ) , and working on the complex plane plus the point at infinity .",
    "the @xmath351 spherical harmonics in stereographic coordinates are given by @xcite :    @xmath352    now , the critical points of the vector field correspond to the points on the sphere ( complex plane ) where @xmath353 . using the spin - weighted spherical harmonics in spherical",
    "coordinates one can prove the following lemma .",
    "the restriction of a killing vector field of an asymptotically flat spacetime to @xmath6 vanishes at most in two points of the sphere ( and at least in one ) .",
    "the result follows noting that if @xmath353 , then one has    @xmath354    a second degree equation in c. from the fundamental theorem of algebra , one knows that the equation has two roots .",
    "the vector field will vanish at least in one point , so without loss of generality one can set this point to be the origin of the complex plane ( the north pole of the sphere ) , and the other root ( if present ) to lie on the real axis .",
