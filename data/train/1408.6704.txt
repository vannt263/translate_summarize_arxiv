    "we introduced recently in @xcite an approach to prove the metastable behavior of markov chains which has been successfully applied in several different contexts . we refer to @xcite for a description of the method and for examples of markov chains",
    "whose metastable behavior has been established with this approach .",
    "we examine in this article the metastable behavior of reversible random walks in force fields .",
    "this is an old problem whose origin can be traced back at least to kramers @xcite .",
    "it has been adressed by freidlin and wentsell @xcite and by galves , olivieri and vares @xcite in the context of small random perturbations of dynamical systems , and , more recently , by bovier , eckhoff , gayrard and klein in a series of papers @xcite through the potential theoretic approach .",
    "this problem has raised interest and has found applications in many areas , as computer sciences @xcite and chemical physics @xcite .    the first main result of this article , theorem [ vs07 ] , states that starting from a neighborhood of a local minimum of the force field , in an appropriate time - scale , the evolution of the random walk can be described by a reversible markov chain in a finite graph , in which the vertices represent the wells of the force field and the edges the saddle points .",
    "more precisely , denote by @xmath5 a reversible random walk evolving in a discretization of a bounded domain @xmath10 according to a force field @xmath11 . a precise definition of the dynamics is given below in .",
    "let @xmath12 be the local minima of the field @xmath9 , and let @xmath13 be the process which records the minima visited : @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 if the chain @xmath5 belongs to a neighborhood of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 otherwise . clearly , @xmath13 is not markovian .",
    "theorem [ vs07 ] asserts that starting from a neighborhood of a local minimum @xmath15 , there exists a time scale @xmath18 , which depends on @xmath14 , in which @xmath19 converges in some topology to a markovian dynamics whose state space is a subset of @xmath20 .",
    "this asymptotic dynamics may have absorbing points , and its jump rates depend solely on the behavior of the potential in the neighborhoods of the local minima and in the neighborhoods of the saddle points .",
    "theorem [ vs07 ] is similar in spirit to the one of no , wu , prinz and plattner @xcite , who proved that projected metastable markovian dynamics can be well approximated by hidden markovian dynamics .",
    "the second main result , theorem [ vs20 ] , adresses the problem of the exit points from a domain .",
    "consider a local minimum @xmath15 of the force field and denote by @xmath21 the lowest saddle points of @xmath9 which separate @xmath15 from the other local minima .",
    "theorem [ vs20 ] provides the asymptotic probabilities that the chain @xmath5 will traverse a mesoscopic neighborhood of a saddle point @xmath22 before hitting another local minima of the force field .",
    "we explained already in @xcite the main differences between our approach and the potential theoretic one @xcite , and between our approach and the pathwise one due to cassandro , galves , olivieri and vares @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat this exposition here .",
    "our approach does not aim to characterize the typical paths in a transition between two metastable states , in contrast with the transition path theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the case where the number of wells is small , as in the examples presented in @xcite , theorems [ vs07 ] and [ vs20 ] describe the distribution of the transition paths , at least at the scale of the metastable sets , by indicating the sequence of metastable sets visited in a transition between two metastable sets .    in the case of complex networks , the lennard ",
    "jones clusters analyzed in @xcite for instance , to give a rough view of the transition paths from two metastable states , we may proceed in two ways .",
    "one possibility is to reduce the number of nodes by considering the trace of the original chain on a subset of the state space ( cf .",
    "* section 6.1 ) for the definition of trace processes ) .",
    "avena and gaudillire @xcite proposed a natural algorithm to reduce the number of vertices of a chain .",
    "the algorithm produces a subset @xmath23 with the property that the mean hitting time of @xmath23 does not depend on the starting point . in this sense the vertices of @xmath23 are `` uniformly '' distributed among the set of nodes .",
    "the algorithm can also be calibrated to provide a large or small set of nodes @xmath23 .",
    "another possibility is to identify certain nodes , losing the markov property , and to apply theorem [ vs07 ] below to approximate this new dynamics by a markovian dynamics . to describe the transition paths at this level of accuracy",
    ", one can compute for these reduced dynamics the equilibrium potential between two metastable sets ( the committor in the terminology of @xcite ) , and the optimal flow for thomson s principle ( the probability current of reactive trajectories ) .    in both cases ,",
    "the selection of the set of nodes or the selection of nodes to be merged have to be carried out judiciously , to reduce as much as possible the number of nodes without losing the essential features of the original chain . from a computational point of view",
    ", the jump rates of trace process are easily calculated , while the jump rates of projected processes are more difficult to derive . in the first case , it suffices to apply recursively the first displayed equation below the proof of corollary 6.2 in @xcite , while in the second case , one has to calculate the capacities between the metastable sets .",
