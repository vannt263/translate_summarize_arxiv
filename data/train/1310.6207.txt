    "@xcite optical techniques have been used to verify these models , but are limited by selection rules requiring @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the orbital angular momentum ) and have supplied restrictive information about @xmath7 transition materials as @xmath10 transitions can involve a change in the spin or no change in @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite such techniques are also sensitive to a variety of cross sections , including strong multiple phonon scattering , which often mask the subtle @xmath10 transitions .",
    "@xcite here we use neutron scattering to measure the magnetic excitations within the mott - hubbard gap of coo to illustrate that coo is a classical mott - hubbard insulator where the excitations are based upon crystal field excitations within the large mott gap .",
    "coo has a high temperature cubic rock salt structure and below a temperature of 295 k , the magnetic structure becomes antiferromagnetic , accompanied by a structural transition to a predominately tetragonal unit cell with @xmath11 at 10 k.  @xcite the electronic structure has both spin and orbital moments making coo unusual when compared with other transition metal materials such as nickelates or cuprates .",
    "@xcite the antiferromagnetic structure is uncertain with both collinear and non - collinear order describing the neutron diffraction data equally well .  @xcite inelastic neutron scattering has shown the existence of low lying magnetic branches corresponding to coupled spin and orbital moments .",
    "@xcite however , no complete theory including both spin and orbital moments with nearest and next nearest exchange terms , the magnetic structure , spin - orbit splitting , and crystal field parameters have been developed .",
    "part of the failure to understand the low - energy properties of coo is the ambiguity behind the electronic ground state of the co@xmath12 ion and , in particular , the role of spin - orbit coupling which is difficult to extract and disentangle in the presence of strong exchange terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "original calculations based upon lda+u resulted in energy scales too large to explain the observed spectrum obtained from non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "@xcite further calculations showed that the observed energy scales involved orbital transitions and not the large mott hubbard gap @xmath13 ev .",
