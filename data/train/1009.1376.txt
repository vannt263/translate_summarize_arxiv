    "what is the scattering matrix of a matter - coupled gauge theory ? in general , this is a hard question involving both conceptual and technical subtleties .",
    "nevertheless , scattering amplitudes enjoy a much simpler structure than implied by their expansion in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "for some theories , additional off - shell and on - shell symmetries simplify the amplitudes enormously . the further simplification exhibited in the planar ( or infinite - color )",
    "limit may even allow a complete answer to the question .",
    "the or maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory ( msym ) may be such a theory .",
    "the simplifications inherent in the larger symmetry have already allowed explicit calculations of scattering amplitudes well beyond those for other theories . at weak coupling , advances in multi - loop and multi - leg calculations  @xcite have opened the possibility of probing the structure of the scattering matrix to high order in perturbation theory .",
    "the bds conjecture  @xcite for the all - loop resummation of maximally helicity - violating ( mhv ) amplitudes ( based on an earlier relation  @xcite linking one- and two - loop amplitudes ) provides an example of possible structures that can emerge . at strong coupling ,",
    "the leading expansion of scattering amplitudes has been computed using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite by alday , gaiotto , maldacena , sever , and vieira  @xcite .",
    "this two - sided approach , together with the recent developments in the evaluation of scattering amplitudes at strong coupling for any number of external legs and the realization that the relation between certain scattering amplitudes and null polygonal wilson loops carries over from strong coupling  @xcite to the weak - coupling regime  @xcite offer circumstantial evidence that the super - yang - mills theory may ultimately be solvable in the planar limit .",
    "gluon mhv amplitudes , with two external legs of negative helicity and the rest of positive helicity , are the simplest amplitudes in a gauge theory .",
    "they are particularly simple in the planar limit of msym , where they are determined by a single helicity structure , accompanied by a function of scalar and pseudo - scalar momentum invariants , to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this simplicity is of course shared by their parity conjugates , the amplitudes .",
    "the structure of the remaining non - mhv amplitudes is more complicated . at one loop ,",
    "explicit expressions are known  @xcite at arbitrary multiplicity for next - to - mhv ( nmhv ) gluon amplitudes , with three gluons of negative helicity from the rest .",
    "these are already more intricate , with the number of independent helicity structures growing cubicly with the number of external legs , each multiplied by an independent function of scalar and pseudo - scalar invariants .",
    "how does this structure generalize to higher loops ?",
    "no explicit expressions are known to date for higher - loop non - mhv amplitudes . in this paper",
    ", we take a first step towards filling this gap , computing the parity - even part of the two - loop six - gluon nmhv amplitude .",
    "these results were first reported in ref .",
    "this amplitude , which comes with three inequivalent helicity configurations , is the simplest non - mhv amplitude .",
    "general results on the structure of infrared divergences in massless gauge theories suggest on one hand , that the divergent terms have a simple iterative structure ; and on the other , that all planar amplitudes with fixed number of external legs share the same structure of infrared - divergent terms .",
    "together with the structure of the splitting amplitudes , this implies that a natural way to extract infrared - finite quantities from non - mhv amplitudes is to divide them by the mhv amplitudes with the same number of external legs .",
    "drummond , henn , korchemsky , and sokatchev ( dhks ) showed to one - loop order that this ratio is not only finite but also dual conformal invariant for nmhv amplitudes  @xcite and conjectured that the same holds to all orders for all non - mhv amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "drummond , henn , korchemsky , and sokatchev ( dhks ) showed at one - loop order , and conjectured to all orders that the this ratio is not only finite but also dual conformal invariant for nmhv amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "here we clarify and test this conjecture to two - loop order for the six - point amplitude .",
    "this test requires the use of dixon and schabinger s result  @xcite for the @xmath0 terms in the one - loop nmhv six - point amplitude .    as an intriguing consequence of the semiclassical approach of alday and maldacena  @xcite , anticipated by the structure of flat space string theory scattering amplitudes at high energy and fixed angles  @xcite , to leading order in the strong coupling expansion all scattering amplitudes are ( in a certain sense ) insensitive to the flavor and polarization of external legs .",
    "while quantum corrections are likely to alter this conclusion , this structure is surprising from the standpoint of the intricate analytic structure of the weak - coupling scattering matrix .",
    "the arguments of alday and maldacena led to the identification @xcite of a surprising relation between one - loop mhv amplitudes and the one - loop expectation value of special null polygonal wilson loops .",
    "this relation was shown to hold at two loops as well for four- , five-  @xcite and six - particle scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "integral representations of higher - point two - loop mhv amplitudes are also known  @xcite ; comparison with wilson - loop expectation values  @xcite is hindered , however , by the complexity of evaluating the required higher - point two - loop feynman integrals .",
    "dual conformal symmetry  @xcite plays an important role in the relation between mhv scattering amplitudes and wilson loops .",
    "this symmetry is manifest for the integrands of both mhv scattering amplitudes and wilson loops , but it is broken by the dimensional regulator .",
    "dual - conformal invariants can be constructed by using the general structure of divergent terms .",
    "a particular pattern of spontaneous breaking of the gauge group provides an alternative regularization in which this symmetry is restored through natural transformations of the regulator  @xcite .",
    "preserves this symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether non - mhv amplitudes also exhibit a similar presentation in terms of wilson loops .",
    "a necessary condition is that they exhibit dual conformal invariance upon extraction of infrared divergences .",
    "it is possible to argue that , to all orders in the loop expansion , four - dimensional cuts of any planar scattering amplitude in  sym , in particular non - mhv amplitudes , have this symmetry .",
    "hints in this direction also come from the grassmannian interpretation of leading singularities ; in that framework it was shown  @xcite that leading singularities are dual conformally invariant .",
    "whether this symmetry survives in the complete amplitude , in the presence of the terms not constructible from four - dimensional cuts , is an open question .",
    "here we will see that the parity - even part of the six - point nmhv amplitudes can be expressed in terms of pseudo - conformal integrals , _",
    "i.e. _ dimensionally regulated integrals that are invariant under dual conformal transformations when continued off - shell .",
    "while the structure of collinear limits of non - mhv amplitudes is somewhat more intricate than those of mhv amplitudes , the former are governed by the same splitting amplitudes as the latter . the iteration relation for mhv amplitudes",
    "@xcite suggests that one can capture both the infrared - divergent parts of non - mhv amplitudes , as well as the amplitudes behavior under collinear limits , via an exponentiation ansatz for all the scalar functions that characterize them .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the bds  @xcite exponentiation ansatz for mhv amplitudes .",
    "such an ansatz is not expected to hold to all orders .",
    "departures from it are characterized by dual conformal invariant functions which have properties analogous to the mhv remainder function  @xcite .",
    "we perform the calculation using the generalized unitarity - based method , employing a variety of four - dimensional and @xmath1-dimensional cuts to express the amplitude in terms of six - point two - loop feynman integrals .",
    "the four - dimensional cuts are evaluated in on - shell superspace  @xcite .",
    "this approach automatically takes into account supersymmetry relations between different components of cuts and also offers guidance in organizing the calculation .",
    "we find that the ( appropriately defined ) parity - even part of the six - point amplitude may be expressed as a sum of pseudo - conformal integrals  @xcite , in close analogy with the four - point amplitude through five loops  @xcite and the parity - even part of the five - point amplitude through two loops  @xcite .",
    "there are some additional integrals in the one- and two - loop six - point amplitudes , whose pseudo - conformal nature is less clear .",
    "their integrands vanish as @xmath2 , yet their integrals can be nonvanishing in this limit .",
    "we evaluate the integrals using the ambre  @xcite and mb  @xcite packages and compute the amplitude numerically at several kinematic points , related in pairs by dual conformal transformations .",
    "the infrared singularities of our expression have the structure expected from general considerations  @xcite .",
    "we have tested numerically the dual - conformal properties of the various finite functions that can be constructed from the six - point nmhv amplitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the tree - level and one - loop six - point amplitudes in section  [ review ] , along with their superspace presentation and their conjectured properties .",
    "most importantly , we identify a canonical separation of the six - point nmhv amplitude into parity - even and parity - odd components .",

    "the essential ones are that ( 1 ) their arguments may depend on loop momenta ( if the cut conditions do not completely freeze the momentum integrals ) and ( 2 ) they may not make the symmetries of the amplitude manifest .",
    "we wish to express these grassmann delta functions in terms of structures that appeared at lower - loop order ; in the case of the six - point nmhv amplitude ; these are the dual superconformal @xmath61 invariants .",

    "a possible strategy for eliminating the dependence of the delta functions on loop momenta is to make use of the fact that a grassmann delta function equals its argument .",

    "albeit nontrivial due to their high rank , the tensor integrals may then be reduced following the standard strategy of integral reduction .",
    "while indeed successful in eliminating the loop momentum dependence from the grassmann delta functions , this strategy is likely to lead to rather unwieldy expressions .",
    "we will not pursue this direction .",

    "provides a different strategy , as the points @xmath209 need not be chosen following the leading - singularity prescription .",

    "@xmath209 it is possible to have @xmath213 be proportional to the delta functions appearing in the @xmath61 dual superconformal invariants .    because of the arbitrariness in the choice of the @xmath209 , the decomposition of @xmath206 in a linear combination of `` good '' grassmann delta functions , such as the delta functions appearing in the dual superconformal invariants , is not unique .",

    "[ 2loopints ] ]      let us illustrate the general strategy outlined in the previous section , by examining in some detail two cuts that are essential for the construction of the six - point nmhv superamplitude .",
