    "polaron physics and , more in general , electron - phonon interactions are one of the most influential areas of modern condensed matter physics    and are believed to play a major role in the physics of high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite and strongly correlated materials .",
    "ultracold gases , on the other hand , allow for the investigation of open issues in condensed matter using clean and highly tunable systems ( see e.g. [ ] , [ ] and [ ] ) . in the context of polaron physics , the so - called spin - polaron , i.e. a single spin down impurity immersed in a fermi sea of spin up particles has been realized as the extreme limit of imbalanced fermi mixtures whenever @xmath2 and a remarkable agreement between theory @xcite and experiments @xcite has been achieved .",
    "the original polaron problem @xcite deals however with fermionic particles ( electrons ) interacting with lattice vibrations ( phonons ) , which obey the bosonic statistics , and is therefore somehow closer to the physics of bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "bose - fermi mixtures have been widely investigated during the last few years both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the main focus however has been on the effect of the fermionic component of the mixture on the coherence properties of the bosonic condensate and on the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition .",
    "in addition theoretical efforts were devoted to investigate the emergence of supersolid and other exotic phases @xcite . in a strongly imbalanced mixture of @xmath3 bosons and @xmath4 spinless fermions with @xmath5 , the dilute fermionic particles act as dynamic impurities in the bosonic condensate . on the other hand ,",
    "if one focuses on the fermionic component , the experimental setup closely resembles the polaronic problem in condensed matter , since fermionic atoms interact with phononic excitations of the condensate .",
    "again , the main advantage of ultracold gases is that both the relative densities of the components and their mutual interactions can be tuned much more easily and to a larger extent than the corresponding condensed matter case .",
    "the extreme imbalanced limit allows for example to neglect the interactions between different polarons and address the _ single polaron _",
    "regime with relative simplicity .",
    "a remarkable achievement in this direction has been , e.g. , the recent experiment performed by the bloch group @xcite , where a lattice bose - fermi mixture of @xmath0 was studied , exploiting an interspecies fano - feshbach resonance to tune the bose - fermi scattering length @xmath6 and varying the relative densities @xmath7 of the species .",
    "this allowed to study the effect of the interspecies interaction and of the population imbalance between bosons and fermions on the transition from superfluid to mott insulator in a very controlled way .    a theoretical description of one - dimensional bose - fermi mixtures in terms of a luttinger liquid of polarons has been proposed in [ ] , while the problem of polaron formation for a single impurity immersed in a homogeneous condensate has been studied in [ ] and more recently in [ ] .",
    "other works addressed the emergence of polarons in the context of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "they considered bosonic impurities loaded in an optical lattice and the whole system immersed in a large condensate of a different bosonic species .",
    "only the impurities were affected by the lattice , allowing for an arbitrary slowing down of the impurities without perturbing the condensate ( see section [ comparison ] for further details ) .",
    "this scenario could in principle be realized in experiments using a species - selective optical lattice .",
    "however this kind of setup , to our knowledge , has not yet been applied to bose - fermi mixtures , although several experimental schemes have been proposed @xcite and species - selective lattices have already been successfully applied to bose - bose mixtures @xcite . in current experiments on bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices , like e.g. in ref . [ ] , _ both _ species are affected ( though to a different extent ) by the same optical lattice . in the latter case",
    "the tunneling properties of both species are intrinsically connected to each other , and the properties of the bogoliubov modes of the condensate and their coupling to the fermionic particles are modified by the lattice .    for these reasons , in this work",
    "we generalize the theory developed in ref . [ ] to the case where both the fermions and the bosons move in the same optical lattice . despite the presence of the lattice , we show that , in a suitable parameter regime , the bosonic condensate still sustains phonon - like excitations and the general framework developed for the homogeneous case in ref .",
    "[ ] still applies .",
    "we find that fermionic particles are exponentially slowed down by the interaction with the bogoliubov modes of the condensate , due to polaron formation .",
    "we also discuss the relevance of our approach to current experiments on bose - fermi mixtures , analyzing the assumptions we made in order to derive our theory .",
    "for the specific case of a @xmath0 mixture , we provide results for the polaronic hopping renormalization of a single fermionic impurity in several experimental setups , i.e. for different values of the bosonic density , lattice depth , bose - fermi scattering length and temperature .",
    "this effect can actually be measured by looking at the expansion of the fermionic component of the mixture in a lattice when the trapping potential is suddenly removed and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : in the next section we explain how under suitable conditions a bose - fermi mixture can be effectively described in terms of polarons and derive an expression for the fermionic hopping renormalization due to polaronic effects . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we analyze our assumptions within a generic experimental setup for bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices .",
    "results for the fermionic hopping renormalization in a @xmath0 mixture are provided in section [ results ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the derivation of this section follows closely the one in ref . [ ] , generalizing it to the case where single hyperfine states of a bosonic and fermionic species are loaded together into an optical lattice generated by counterpropagating laser beams of wavelength @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . for far off - resonant laser beams ,",
    "the atoms experience a potential @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bosonic ( fermionic ) recoil energy , @xmath13 denotes the dimensionless lattice depth for bosons and fermions in the respective recoil energy and @xmath14 is the lattice spacing , which we use as a unit length .",
    "we choose the _ fermionic _ recoil energy @xmath15 as energy unit throughout the paper .",
    "the effect of the trapping potential is neglected and we postpone a thorough discussion about the correctness of our assumptions to the next section .",
    "the system under investigation is assumed to be described by a single band bose - fermi hubbard model , with the hamiltonian @xmath16 the fermions do not interact ( directly ) with each other .",
    "however , as we will see later , they can still interact via boson - mediated interactions , a situation which is very similar to the bcs model for standard superconductivity , where phonons mediate the attractive interactions between the electrons .",
    "we consider first the case @xmath17 , where the fermions act as a set of static impurities on the bosonic system and their position is specified by the ( discrete ) distribution function @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the bosonic system in the presence of impurities can be treated within bogoliubov theory , meaning that we consider the solution of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in the presence of impurities and quantize the oscillations around the classical deformed ground state . if the fermionic impurities were absent ( @xmath19 or equivalently @xmath20 ) , then for the unperturbed system of bosons we can write the following gp equation by approximating the bosonic field operators with c - numbers @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 where the sum in the first term runs over the nearest neighbors of the lattice site @xmath24 . in the case of a uniform system ( in the lattice ) , this equation is trivially solved by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the coordination number of the lattice and @xmath28 is the density of particles per lattice site in the fully condensed state described by the classical gp theory ( no quantum depletion of the condensate ) . in the presence of static fermionic impurities ( @xmath17 ) , the previous result has to be modified because the condensate macroscopic wavefunction is distorted by the impurities .",
    "if this distortion is sufficiently small then we can expand the classical field around the unperturbed solution , i.e. @xmath29 and keep only the leading non - zero terms in the fluctuation @xmath30 .",
    "this approximation is valid if @xmath31 and in this case the gp hamiltonian has the form @xmath32 where : @xmath33 - \\mu_b \\sum_i |\\psi^0_i|^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{u_{bb}}{2}\\sum_i |\\psi^0_i|^4   + u_{bf}\\sum_i |\\psi^0_i|^2 f_i \\\\ h_{\\delta } = & & -j_b   \\sum_{<i , j > }    [ \\delta^*_i \\delta_j + h.c . ] - \\mu_b \\sum_i |\\delta_i|^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2 u_{bb } \\sum_i   |\\delta_i|^2 |\\psi^0_i|^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{u_{bb}}{2 } \\sum_i ( \\delta^*_i |\\psi^0_i|^2",

    "the linear term in the fluctuation @xmath30 in @xmath34 is identically zero because we choose @xmath35 as the solution of the unperturbed gp equation .    by imposing the first derivative of this expression with respect to @xmath36 to vanish and using the conditions @xmath25 and @xmath37",
    ", we obtain the following gp equation for the fluctuation field @xmath38 @xmath39 this equation can be recast in the following form @xmath40 where we introduce the healing length of the condensate @xmath41 therefore the gp equation for the fluctuation field @xmath30 has the form of a discrete modified helmholtz equation where the impurity distribution acts as a source term . for a weakly interacting condensate",
    "the healing length @xmath42 is larger than the lattice spacing @xmath43 and we can consider the continuum limit of eq .",
    "( [ gpe_latt ] ) applying the same considerations discussed in [ ] .",
    "the healing length @xmath42 fixes the typical scale for the variation in space of the fluctuation field @xmath30 due to the impurities .",
    "this means that the perturbation induced in the condensate by the impurities decays exponentially in space with the healing length @xmath42 and the condition @xmath31 ( small perturbation of the condensate due to the impurities ) implies ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dimension of the system under consideration .",
    "using the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gpe_latt ] ) , the gp hamiltonian provides the classical value of the ground state energy as a function of the impurity distribution @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath47 .      in the previous subsection we considered how the classical condensate is distorted in the presence of static impurities without including any quantum effects .",
    "we now consider the bogoliubov excitations on top of the classical theory , decomposing the bosonic quantum operators in a classical and a quantum part , i.e. @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the solution of the gp equation described above .",
    "if we insert this expression in the hamiltonian and retain only the terms up to the second order in the fluctuation fields , we obtain that all the linear terms in the fluctuation fields ( classical and quantum ) disappear since we have chosen the classical part as the solution of the gp equation in the presence of impurities . therefore the hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 as evident from the expression above , the quantum part of the hamiltonian is independent of the impurity distribution and only depends on the unperturbed classical ground state through @xmath35 .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath52 can be diagonalized using a bogoliubov transformation ( see [ ] for a general treatment ) and we can re - express @xmath53 in terms of the bogoliubov modes of the condensate .",

    "the major difference in these expressions with respect to the continuum case treated in [ ] is that the fbz provides a natural cut - off for the single - particle energy and therefore also for the energy of the bogoliubov modes . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we sketched for comparison the shifted single - particle spectrum @xmath67 and the energy spectrum @xmath68 of the bogoliubov modes .    once expressed in terms of the bogoliubov operators , the hamiltonian of the system is diagonal and assumes the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the quantum correction to the classical ground state energy due to the zero - point motion of bogoliubov modes .",
    "as already noticed in [ ] , since the bogoliubov hamiltonian ( [ bogo_hamilt ] ) does not depend on the impurities distribution , this means that the bogoliubov spectrum is unaffected by the position of the impurities and we have the same oscillation frequencies which we would have in the absence of the impurities .",
    "the equilibrium position of these condensate oscillations are however shifted by the presence of impurities . since the bogoliubov spectrum does not depend on the impurity positions , we can also switch the order of the steps in the preceding derivation and calculate the bogoliubov theory around the unperturbed ground state ( no impurities ) , which is given by the assumption @xmath71 and keeping only terms up to second order in the fluctuation fields @xmath72 . in this case we obtain the same expression as before for the bogoliubov part while the classical part is not anymore the solution of gp equation in the presence of impurities .",

    "( [ slow_imp ] ) . in this sense",
    "this treatment is analogous to the the antiadiabatic limit ( fast phonons ) of the small polaron theory introduced by holstein @xcite where the impurities move much slower than the time taken by the coherent cloud to rearrange itself .",
    "here we would like to point out that in the expression ( [ slow_imp ] ) , the bare fermionic hopping @xmath81 is not compared with the bare bosonic hopping @xmath103 but with @xmath94 which explicitly depends also on the bose - bose interaction and the bosonic density .",
    "this is because in bose - fermi mixtures the _ excitations _ of the bosonic condensate and not the original bosonic particles play the role analogous to of phonons in the standard polaronic problem .",

    "this point is crucial for the understanding of the temperature dependence of the @xmath115 factor .",
    "for example , for fixed values of @xmath28 , @xmath115 increases with temperature due to the increasing number of excited phonons , and therefore one would expect that the minimal slowing of the impurities occurs at @xmath127 , where only the zero point motion of the bogoliubov modes contributes . at the same time",
    "however , @xmath28 decreases with @xmath123 for fixed bosonic density @xmath125 and the overall temperature dependence is determined by the competition between thermal depletion of the condensate and thermal excitation of the bogoliubov modes .",
    "the energy spectrum of the bogoliubov modes @xmath128 acquires a temperature dependence through @xmath126 which is missing in the standard condensed matter case , where an increasing temperature only increases the phononic population and therefore the @xmath115 factor @xcite .",
    "this results in a mayor difference between the condensed matter and present case , and also suggests the existence of a richer temperature dependence of polaronic effects in the bose - fermi mixtures realization .",
    "indeed , it is possible that different mixtures ( or even the same mixture for different parameter range ) show different slopes in @xmath129 or even a nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "a sketch of the dependence of the renormalization factor @xmath115 on @xmath123 and @xmath120 for fixed @xmath28 is drawn in fig . [ damping ] .",
    "this would be the relevant case whenever the depletion can be neglected in the range of parameters under investigation and @xmath130 . as shown in section [ results ] , this is not the case for the @xmath0 setup we considered .",
    "in any case it is worth noting that also at @xmath127 there is a sizable contribution to the s factor from all the bogoliubov modes with quasimomenta within the fbz .     as a function of bose - fermi coupling @xmath120 and temperature @xmath123 ( @xmath131 ) for fixed @xmath28 .",

    "the fbz provide a natural cut - off to the high - energy phonons contribution , while the analogous role of the physical cutoff in the continuum case is played by an additional exponential decay of the matrix elements @xmath79 for large momenta .",
    "indeed the matrix elements @xmath79 in the continuum case @xcite are given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the free - particle dispersion , @xmath135 is the energy of the bogoliubov modes in the continuum @xcite , @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the wannier wavefunction of the impurity localized at site @xmath138 .",

    "a situation in which the bosonic condensate is unaffected by the lattice would be more favorable to realize the _ slow impurity _",

    "in this section we analyze the assumptions we made in deriving our approach within a generic experimental setup for bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices .",
    "since bosons and fermions are loaded into a single optical lattice of frequency @xmath9 , both species experience the same laser intensity @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the atomic dynamic polarizability at the laser frequency .",

    "therefore , even though formally our approach to the homogeneous setup in the two - dimensional case is well defined at @xmath127 , the bogoliubov treatment of the bosonic component immediately breaks down at any finite temperature in that case , and therefore we can not directly apply our findings to a two - dimensional setup .    in practice ( quasi )",
    "two - dimensional systems are obtained by strongly increasing the optical lattice in one direction ( e.g. in the @xmath27 direction ) such that the motion in this direction is frozen and only the zero point motion has to be considered @xcite . under this condition",
    "it is possible to distinguish between two regimes .",
    "whenever @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the typical width of the onsite wavefunction in the direction of the tight confinement , then the scattering process is still essentially three - dimensional even if the motion is essentially two - dimensional . in this case",
    "the @xmath155 scattering length can be safely used and the local interaction @xmath156 increases with the confinement in the @xmath27 direction since the overlap between the local wavefunctions is increased . for the case",
    "@xmath157 a more refined treatment is required @xcite . in this case",
    "strong modifications of the interaction both in modulus and sign can occur in the system .",
    "the main feature of interest for the present paper is that the confinement can actually be used to further tune the interaction between the bosons in order to access different regimes in bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "even though the existence of a real condensate has been predicted for the case of trapped ( quasi- ) two - dimensional setups @xcite at low temperature , the application of the bogoliubov approach necessarily needs the trapping potential to be explicitly included in the treatment . since in this case",
    "a full numerical solution of the corresponding bogoliubov theory is required , we postpone the analysis of this interesting case to the future despite its intrinsic interest .",
    "on the other hand we expect the general conclusions of the paper to be still valid also in a @xmath158 setup .",
    "for the reasons above , the approach is developed in the general case , when possible , but only results for the three - dimensional case are shown .",
