    "there are a number of spatially explicit models of community dynamics , i.e. , models where individuals are located on a geometrical structure and can only interact with nearby individuals , for which the long - term behavior has been proved to strongly differ from that of their non - spatial counterparts .",
    "see for instance  @xcite for a discussion on this aspect .",
    "this shows that space is often a key component in how communities are shaped .",
    "this paper studies an interacting particle system of evolutionary games which turns out to be a good illustration of the fact that space matters in the sense that the results we collect show significant discrepancies between the spatially explicit stochastic model and its so - called mean - field version .",
    "+ evolutionary game theory was proposed by theoretical biologist maynard smith and first appeared in  @xcite .",
    "although evolutionary games were originally introduced to understand animal conflicts , they now have a number of important applications in various branches of social sciences . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the stochastic process we consider is an example of interacting particle system ( @xcite ) where each vertex of the  @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice is occupied by a player , who is characterized by her strategy .",
    "thus , the state of the system at time  @xmath1 is a spatial configuration @xmath2 the dynamics depends on a payoff matrix  @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the payoff of a type  @xmath5 player interacting with a type  @xmath6 player . in the presence of two strategies , which we assume from now on , there are exactly  @xmath7 possible orderings of the four payoffs .",
    "since there is symmetry under exchange of type labels , we may assume  @xmath8 , which gives twelve possible games or strategic situations .",
    "the most popular such games are the prisoner s dilemma , the hawk - dove game and the stag hunt game .",
    "to define the evolution rules , we let  @xmath9 be an integer referred to as the range of the interactions and let @xmath10 be respectively the interaction neighborhood of site  @xmath11 and the fraction of neighbors of that site following strategy  @xmath5 .",
    "having a payoff matrix and a spatial configuration induces a so - called payoff landscape that assigns a payoff to each player on the infinite integer lattice by setting @xmath12 the basic idea and starting point of evolutionary game theory is to turn the game into a dynamical system by interpreting the payoff as fitness or reproduction success , meaning that the type or strategy of a player is more likely to be selected at each interaction as her payoff gets larger .",
    "specifically , the model considered in this paper evolves according to the following simple rules :    = 2.25em    players update their strategy at rate one by mimicking their neighbor with the largest payoff . in case of a tie , meaning that two neighbors with different strategies share the same highest payoff , the new strategy is chosen uniformly at random by flipping a fair coin .",
    "this model is chronologically the last one of a series of four that we have studied so far .",
    "the first three models are built from the following rules .",
    "= 2.25em    * payoff affecting birth and death rates *  @xcite .",
    "when a player has a positive payoff , at rate this payoff , one of her neighbors chosen at random adopts her strategy , whereas when her payoff is negative , at rate minus this payoff , she adopts the strategy of one of her neighbors chosen at random .",
    "this updating rule is inspired from  @xcite .    * best - response dynamics *  @xcite . players update their strategy at rate one in order to maximize their payoff , which depends on the strategy of their neighbors .    *",
    "death - birth updating process *  @xcite .",
    "players update their strategy at rate one by mimicking a neighbor chosen at random according to probabilities that are proportional to the neighbors payoff . the weak selection approximation of this process , which is a voter model perturbation , has first been studied heuristically in  @xcite and then analytically in  @xcite using duality techniques for interacting particle systems .",
    "note that the model we consider in this paper can be viewed as a nonlinear version of the death - birth updating process in the sense that , like in the death - birth process , players update their strategy at rate one by mimicking one of their neighbors , but unlike in the death - birth process , they always choose to imitate their fittest neighbor .",
    "in spite of their similarities , the two models exhibit different behaviors and the approaches to study them strongly differ . to turn our verbal description of the evolution rules into equations ,",
    "we define @xmath13 which by convention  @xmath14 when there is no type  @xmath5 neighbor .",
    "this random variable keeps track of the largest payoff among all the neighbors of site  @xmath11 who follow strategy  @xmath5 .",
    "then , the transition rates at vertex  @xmath11 are given by @xmath15 in each transition , the first indicator function means that the player always mimics her fittest neighbor while the second indicator function means that , in case of a tie , she chooses her new strategy at random by tossing a fair coin .",
    "since one of our main objectives is to understand and quantify the role of space in the interactions among players , the first step is to briefly study the mean - field model . letting  @xmath16 denote the frequency of players following strategy  @xmath5 and assuming that the population is well - mixing gives the differential equation @xmath17 to study the mean - field model and describe its bifurcation diagram , it is convenient to adopt the approach of  @xcite by introducing the new parameters @xmath18 and declaring strategy  @xmath5 to be    = 1.75em    * altruistic * when  @xmath19 , i.e. , a player with strategy  @xmath5 confers a lower payoff to a player with the same strategy than the other strategy ,    * selfish * when  @xmath20 , i.e. , a player with strategy  @xmath5 confers a higher payoff to a player with the same strategy than the other strategy .    in terms of  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 , the mean - field model reduces to @xmath23 using that  @xmath24 gives the three fixed points @xmath25 whose global stability is as follows :    = 1.75em    strategy  @xmath5 wins",
    "if it is selfish and the other strategy altruistic : @xmath26    when both strategies are altruistic , coexistence occurs : @xmath27    when both strategies are selfish , the system is bistable : @xmath28    recalling that a strategy is said to be evolutionary stable if , when adopted by a population , it can not be invaded by any alternative strategy starting at an infinitesimally small frequency , the dynamics of the mean - field model can be summarized as : a strategy is evolutionary stable if and only if it is selfish .",
    "+    we now turn our attention to the spatial model  .",
    "to visualize our results , we turn the four - dimensional parameter space into a two - dimensional picture by fixing the payoffs  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "the five straight lines @xmath31 induce a partition of the set of parameters into twelve regions corresponding to the twelve possible strategic relationships .",
    "these twelve regions are shown in figure  [ fig : games ] along with the names of the most popular games in the  @xmath32 plane under the assumption  @xmath33 .",
    "our main results stated and explained below are summarized in the two phase diagrams of figures  [ fig : diagram-2d][fig : diagram-1d ] .",
    "+ to begin with , we look at parameter regions where at least one of the two strategies is selfish .",
    "to understand the spatial model in this case , we observe that , when the minimum payoff of a type  1 player exceeds the maximum payoff of a type  2 player over all possible configurations , i.e. , @xmath34 the set of type  1 players becomes a pure growth process : type  1 players never change their strategy whereas each type  2 player with at least one type  1 neighbor changes her strategy at rate one .",
    "this implies that strategy  1 wins , in agreement with the mean - field model .",
    "this result can be improved upon by comparing the set of players for whom they and their neighbors eventually maintain strategy  1 to the limit of a certain bootstrap percolation process .",
    "[ th : bootstrap ] assume that the process starts from a translation invariant product measure with a positive density of each type .",
    "then ,    1 .   there is fixation to a configuration with a positive density of strategy  1 ( in particular , strategy  2 can not win ) when @xmath35 2 .",
    "strategy  1 wins when @xmath36 where  @xmath37 is the neighborhood size .    by symmetry",
    ", we also have that    * there is fixation to a configuration with a positive density of strategy  2 ( in particular , strategy  1 can not win ) when @xmath38 * strategy  2 wins when @xmath39    see figure  [ fig : diagram-2d ] for a picture of the phase diagram in the  @xmath32 plane .",
    "note that the parameter regions not covered by the theorem are    * the region where both strategies are altruistic corresponding to the battle of the sexes , the leader game and the hawk - dove game , and * the triangular region corresponding to the prisoner s dilemma game ,    and we now focus our attention on and collect results for the spatial model in these two more challenging parameter regions in the one - dimensional case .",
    "+ first , when both strategies are altruistic , numerical simulations suggest that coexistence occurs provided the range of the interactions is large .",
    "the result is difficult to prove in the general case but we were able to show it for the one - dimensional system under some symmetric condition .",
    "[ th : long - range ] assume that @xmath40 and that the process starts from a translation invariant product measure with a positive density of each type .",
    "then , @xmath41    to establish the theorem , we will show that if an interval of length  @xmath42 has at least  @xmath43 players of each type then , with probability close to one , a certain translation of this interval will satisfy the same property after some fixed deterministic time .",
    "in addition to large deviation estimates to prove that the number of representatives of a given strategy in a given interval can not vary too fast , the key ingredient is that , as long as the target interval does not contain any type  @xmath5 player , the rightmost type  @xmath5 player to the left of this interval is the fittest neighbor of all her neighbors with the possibility of a tie .",
    "this will be used to show that the minority type can spread and invade nearby regions .",
    "+ to understand the role of space in the prisoner s dilemma game , we now specialize in the one - dimensional system with nearest neighbor interactions . in this case",
    ", the process can be studied by looking at the interfaces between blocks of type  1 players and blocks of type  2 players .",
    "+ to begin with , we look at the system starting from an arbitrary configuration with a finite interval of players following strategy  1 not limited to translation invariant product measures . a natural question in this case is to determine whether the players in the initial interval of  1s may change their strategy or not .",
    "our next result gives a lower bound for the probability that these players following initially strategy  1 never change their strategy under the assumption @xmath44 this bound is uniform in all possible initial configurations outside the interval of type  1 players .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath45 \\cap { \\mathbf{z}}\\}\\ ] ] be the set of all the possible configurations that have a row of  @xmath46 players following strategy  1 centered at the origin , and let @xmath47 then , techniques from martingale theory give the following result .",
    "[ th:1d - gold ] let  @xmath48 , @xmath49 and assume  .",
    "then , @xmath50    by symmetry , we have the same result for strategy  2 in the parameter region obtained from   by exchanging the role of the two strategies , i.e. , @xmath51 the two parameter regions   covered by theorem  [ th:1d - gold ] can be conveniently visualized in the  @xmath32 plane as follows . letting @xmath52 with the two payoffs  @xmath29 and  @xmath30",
    "being fixed ,    * the payoffs  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 satisfy   if and only if point  @xmath55 is below all three straight lines , * the payoffs  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 satisfy   if and only if point  @xmath55 is above all three straight lines .",
    "see figure  [ fig : diagram-1d ] for a picture of the three straight lines in the  @xmath32 plane .",
    "+ finally , we assume that the process starts from a translation invariant product measure with a positive density of each strategy .",
    "since in this case the initial configuration contains infinitely many rows of say three type  1 players , it directly follows from theorem  [ th:1d - gold ] and the ergodic theorem that , with probability one , at least one of these rows will expand without bound .",
    "this shows that strategy  1 wins when   holds and that strategy  2 wins when   holds . by identifying finite patterns with a mixture of 1s and 2s that are stable , i.e. , patterns that can not change under the dynamics , when @xmath56 since these patterns are finite and therefore occur infinitely often in the initial configuration , we can also prove that , when   holds , the system fixates to a random configuration with infinitely many type  1 players and infinitely many type  2 players . summarizing , we obtain the following theorem .    [ th:1d ] let  @xmath48 and assume that the process starts from a translation invariant product measure with a positive density of each type .",
    "then ,    1",
    ".   strategy  1 wins when   holds , 2 .   strategy  2 wins when   holds , 3 .",
    "there is fixation to a translation invariant random configuration in which both strategies are present when   holds .",
    "using again the three straight lines introduced above , the parameter region   in which the process fixates corresponds to    * all the parameter pairs  @xmath55 which are below the straight line  @xmath57 and above either  @xmath58 or  @xmath59 when  @xmath33 ,    and we refer to figure  [ fig : diagram-1d ] for a picture . note that the figure shows several disagreements between the spatial and the mean - field models .",
    "for instance , in the prisoner s dilemma triangular region characterized by @xmath60 when strategy  1 is cooperation and strategy  2 is defection , defectors always win in the mean - field model whereas there is a subset of this parameter region in which there is fixation for the one - dimensional system .",
    "this subset is the triangle below the median starting at  @xmath61 in the prisoner s dilemma triangle .",
    "+ the parameter region which is not covered by theorem  [ th:1d ] is the region below the straight line  @xmath59 but above  @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath62 note that  @xmath58 divides this region into two parts . to fix the ideas",
    ", we look at the sub - region below the straight line  @xmath58 which gives the condition @xmath63 in this case , starting with a finite interval of type  1 players while all the other players initially follow strategy  2 , the length of the type  1 interval evolves according to a simple symmetric random walk except that , when the length reaches two , it can not further shrink .",
    "in particular , due to recurrence , the system fluctuates , i.e. , all the players change their strategy infinitely often with probability one .",
    "this implies that none of the two strategies wins and that theorem  [ th:1d - gold ] does not hold in the parameter region  .",
    "since in addition type  2 players with two type  1 neighbors change their strategy at rate one , when starting with a large but finite number of type  1 players , the type  1 intervals merge together until there is only one type  1 interval , which leads to the same conclusion : the system fluctuates . for the system starting with a translation invariant product measure",
    ", we conjecture that strategy  1 wins in the parameter region   because the previous picture suggests that the connected component starting from an interval of type  2 players should be swallowed by the two nearby type  1 intervals .",
    "however , we have not been able to turn this heuristics into a proof because in the pattern @xmath64 the  1 which is underlined can turn into a  2 , and so does the  1 next to it after such an update .",
    "this shows in particular that the length of each type  2 interval can make arbitrarily big jumps and is therefore difficult to control .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th : bootstrap ] .",
    "the first part of the theorem relies on a strong monotonicity result for the process rescaled in space that basically states that large hypercubes of type  1 players can not break when @xmath65 under the stronger assumption of the second part @xmath66 we show that not only the rescaled process is almost surely nondecreasing but also it expands at least like a certain bootstrap percolation model which , together with a result in  @xcite , is the key to proving the second part of the theorem . + throughout this section , configurations of spin systems are often identified with the corresponding set of vertices in state  1 to simplify some of the expressions .",
    "in addition , we think of the evolutionary game model as being generated from a harris graphical representation  @xcite , i.e. , a collection of independent poisson processes .",
    "in contrast with the classical death - birth updating process in which players update their strategy by mimicking a neighbor chosen with a probability proportional to the neighbor s payoff , the new strategy is now chosen deterministically except when there is a tie .",
    "in particular , the graphical representation reduces to a collection of rate one poisson processes , with one process attached to each vertex , together with a collection of independent bernoulli random variables .",
    "more precisely , for each  @xmath67 ,    * we let @xmath68 be a rate one poisson process , * we denote by @xmath69 its @xmath70th arrival time : @xmath71 , * we let  @xmath72 for  @xmath73 be independent .",
    "we think of  @xmath69 as the  @xmath70th time at which the player at  @xmath11 updates her strategy while the bernoulli random variables are only used in case of a tie . since the poisson processes attached to different players are independent and the number of players is countable , with probability one , there are no simultaneous updates . assuming that the process has been constructed up to time  @xmath74 where  @xmath75 , the new configuration is determined from the following rule , where we abuse notation somewhat to view  @xmath76 as the set  @xmath77 .    * in case  @xmath78 , we set  @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 * while if  @xmath81 , we set  @xmath82 if and only if @xmath83    the result of  @xcite , which holds for a large class of interacting systems , guarantees that our process can indeed be constructed using these rules starting from any initial configuration .",
    "+ we now focus on the proof of the theorem . declare a player to be a 1-center when she and all her neighbors follow strategy  1 . to keep track of such players , we introduce the process @xmath84 with this definition , the player at vertex  @xmath11 is a 1-center if and only if  @xmath85 . identifying every configuration  @xmath86 with the set of vertices in state  1 ,",
    "i.e. , with the set of 1-centers , we have the following strong monotonicity result , which is the key to proving the first part of the theorem .",
    "[ lem : bootstrap - weak ] assume  .",

    "the result states that a 1-center is stable in the sense that it remains a 1-center forever .",
    "this is due to the fact that 1-centers get the largest possible payoff and therefore inspire all of their neighbors to stick to strategy  1 .",
    "we now turn our heuristics into a rigorous proof .",
    "+   +    let  @xmath89 be a 1-center at time  @xmath90 .",

    "this implies that , for all  @xmath94 necessarily of type  1 , @xmath95 in particular , for all  @xmath94 , @xmath96 it follows from   that , once a player and all of her neighbors are of type  1 , which makes her a  1-center , they remain so forever .",

    "+   + to prove the second part of the theorem , we compare the set of 1-centers with one of models of bootstrap percolation studied in  @xcite .",
    "this process is the discrete - time two - state spin system that starts from a random configuration but evolves deterministically as follows : occupied vertices remain occupied forever and empty vertices become occupied at the next time step if and only if at least one of their two nearest neighbors in each of the  @xmath0 directions is occupied .",
    "more formally , identifying the state of the process with the set of occupied sites , the dynamics of this bootstrap percolation model is described by @xmath102 for all  @xmath103 where  @xmath104 is the  @xmath5th unit vector in  @xmath105 .",

    "since the  @xmath298 are stable and longer than the range of dependence , the restriction of the process  @xmath299 on each of the finite blocks  @xmath300 , independently for different  @xmath6 , evolves like a finite state markov chain on the state space of patterns with length  @xmath301 , with a fixed pair of type  2 sites at each boundary .",
    "thus , fixation follows once we show that for any fixed finite length , such a chain is absorbing , and to do so we need to show that for any finite length pattern there is a sequence of flips , each with positive rate , that leads to an absorbing configuration .",
