    "we have already seen , however , the first hint that this conjecture is probably too nave in general : one should also take into account whether or not the flat co - ordinates near the cusps associated to @xmath0 and to @xmath2 coincide after analytic continuation .      in what follows we build on work of givental and barannikov to construct a rigorous version of this physical picture in the cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "it has long been known also that there are in general many possible germs of frobenius structures for a given singularity : in our language , this is the statement that one can choose from many possible opposite subspaces . from this point of view , the content of this paper is that more global considerations  monodromy and homogeneity properties  single out a canonical opposite subspace associated to each cusp , and that the opposite subspaces associated to different cusps can be compared via analytic continuation .",
