    "when physical systems such as atoms , molecules , clusters , or nano - objects are exposed to an appropriately tuned radiation field there is a non - negligible chance of ionization . strictly speaking , electron photoemission takes place whenever the exciting field is capable to induce a bound - to - continuum transition and results in electrons escaping with a given kinetic energy and from a given direction .",
    "depending on the characteristics of the radiation , the target system , time and energy scales , there exist many mechanisms that contribute to emit electrons and correspondingly many ways to categorize them : for example , sequential ( fano resonances , auger decay , autoionization / thermionic emission ) and non - sequential processes , single and double ionization , single- and multiphoton ionization , above - threshold ionization , etc . associated with each of these mechanisms",
    "there is as much spectroscopic information to be extracted .",
    "in particular , knowledge about the ionization dynamics and on the parent system can be gained from differential observables of the electron yield .",
    "for instance , the electron photoemission probability as a function of the kinetic energy  the photoelectron spectrum ( pes )  can give insight into electronic energy levels , while the photoelectron angular distribution ( pad ) carries spatial information on ionic positions or directly on the electronic configurations .",
    "if we focus on the ionization mechanism as a function of the external field parameters , we can distinguish among different regimes .",
    "a common classification of the predominant ionization regimes is according to the keldysh parameter  @xcite , originally defined for the hydrogen atom .",
    "this parameter is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the ionization potential of the system , @xmath3 the ponderomotive energy  ( i.e. , the averaged quiver energy in atomic units ) , @xmath4 the intensity of the irradiating light , and @xmath5 the frequency . for @xmath6 ,",
    "one distinguishes two ionization regimes according to the keldysh parameter : the perturbative or nonlinear multiphoton ionization regime  ( mpi )  @xcite which is associated with @xmath7 and the strong - field ionization regime with @xmath8 .    in the multiphoton regime , the laser action results in a vertical excitation of a bound electron into the continuum by absorption of several photons",
    "nevertheless , weak and moderate lasers can promote electrons also far into the continuum by absorption of multiple photons above the ionization threshold .",
    "this non - perturbative process is called above - threshold ionization ( ati )  @xcite and yields to spectra which decay exponentially in energy and that are characterized by a series of peaks separated by @xmath9 .    in the past decade , research in the photoelectron spectroscopy of finite systems has focused predominantly on the strong - field regime which is characterized by the onset of optical field ionization . at sufficiently high field strengths ,",
    "the barrier of the binding coulomb potential is suppressed which results in a tunneling current that follows adiabatically the variation of the laser field  @xcite .",
    "above - threshold ionization still prevails in this regime , however , it is more suitably explained as interferences between coherent photoelectron wavepackets emitted at different times within the laser cycle .",
    "photoelectron spectra and angular distributions in the strong - field regime are particularly rich in information on ionization dynamics since field - driven rescattering is involved .",
    "this process was described by a classical three - step model , also called simpleman s model  @xcite and was later extended to a quantum description ( strong - field approximation )  @xcite using the keldysh ",
    "reiss approximation  @xcite . according to the three - step model the electron",
    "is first released by tunnel ionization .",
    "the tunneled electron is then accelerated in the laser field where it acquires a kinetic energy .",
    "depending on the release time , electrons either leave the parent ion directly or are driven back towards the parent ion once the laser field changes its sign  @xcite .",
    "applications of the field - driven rescattering process are manifold .",
    "for instance , rescattering coherent electron wavepackets can be used to self - interrogate the parent molecular structure .",
    "this phenomenon is exploited for laser - induced electron diffraction  ( lied )  @xcite to image molecular structures .",
    "rescattering and direct photoelectron wavepackets can also interfere coherently which allows to study holographic pattern in photoemission spectra and angular distributions  @xcite . nevertheless , reading recollision induced diffraction images can become a complex task as several processes compete on similar time and energy scales  @xcite .",
    "concerning materials and investigated species in photoemission experiments , research has extended to larger and denser systems in the previous years .",
    "quite recently , signatures of strong - field physics were found by experiments in metallic surfaces  @xcite and nanostructures  @xcite , clusters  @xcite , and dielectric nanospheres  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the exploration of photoionization processes in metal nanotips is currently a strongly evolving field of research .",
    "the combination of femtosecond laser pulses and a sharp metal tip is considered as a laser - driven ultrafast electron emitter on the nanometer scale with prospective applications as electron source in electron microscopy , electron diffraction and for free electron lasers , as an extremely sensitive carrier - envelope phase sensor , or as generators of high - harmonic radiation  @xcite .",
    "calculation of pads from the perturbative to the strong - field regime , and accurate modeling of photoemission experiments on a broad range of materials at the same time , can only be achieved by a comprehensive approach . in general",
    ", the interaction between electrons in an atom or a molecule and a laser field is difficult to treat theoretically , and several approximations are usually employed . for one - electron systems , pes and pad can be calculated exactly by directly solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation  ( tdse ) .",
    "the most straightforward way is by projecting the wavefunction obtained from the tdse at the end of the pulse onto continuum states  @xcite .",
    "another approach where the calculation of the continuum eigenstates is avoided , is the resolvent technique  @xcite .",
    "both methods need to propagate the wavefunction until the end of the pulse in a large space domain in order to obtain the correct distribution of the ejected electrons . for simple cases",
    "this problem can be overcome by the use of spherical coordinates . also geometrical splitting techniques  @xcite turn out to be very useful to reduce computational cost .    for more than two electrons ,",
    "the exact solution of the tdse in three dimensions is unfeasible and basically all ab - initio calculations for multielectron systems are performed under the single - active electron ( sae ) approximation . in the sae",
    "only one electron interacts with the external field while the other electrons are frozen .",
    "this approximation was successfully employed in several photoemission studies for atoms and molecules in strong laser fields  @xcite . besides the tdse , floquet theory  @xcite , the strong - field approximation  @xcite and semi - classical methods  @xcite based on ionization rates  @xcite are used in the strong - field regime . for weak lasers , plane wave methods  @xcite , the independent atomic center approximation  @xcite and ( multiphoton ) perturbation theory  @xcite are usually employed .",
    "however , such approaches reproduce dynamics only qualitatively , and their failure to describe multielectron ( correlation ) effects and their often oversimplified assumptions for the continuum state call for better schemes .",
    "the inclusion of exchange - correlation effects for a system of many interacting electrons can be achieved within time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite .",
    "computations of electronic excitations for systems with up to a few hundred atoms are currently most widely carried out employing this method .",
    "tddft offers a reasonable trade - off between accuracy and computational cost , where other , more accurate , methods  @xcite would not be feasible . in spite of transferring all the many - body problems into an unknown exchange - correlation functional ,",
    "the calculation of pes and pad in tddft is not straightforward . while the total ionization yield can be calculated directly ,",
    "differential quantities can not be expressed in terms of the electron density .",
    "methods based on tddft , therefore , assume that pes and pad can be directly obtained from the time - dependent kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "nevertheless , a close correspondence between spectroscopic data and kohn - sham orbitals exists when using self - interaction - free exchange and correlation functionals  @xcite .    for tddft",
    "there are only two methods to compute pes and pad that can be formulated in finite volumes and that do not require to explicitly calculate continuum states  @xcite : the sampling point method  ( spm )  @xcite and the mask method  ( mm )  @xcite .",
    "both of them were extensively and successfully used for the calculation of photoelectron spectra of atoms , molecules , and clusters  @xcite , model systems for nano - tips  @xcite , and for various experimental setups from time - resolved ( pump - probe ) spectroscopy  @xcite to strong - field ionization of atoms exposed the x - rays  @xcite .",
    "however , both methods present limitations in practical applications .",
    "for instance , mm becomes demanding to converge for low kinetic energies ( @xmath10  ev ) .",
    "this is because mm requires fourier transforms of the wavefunctions .",
    "thus , small energy steps and consequently small momenta are associated with large spatial dimension that become increasingly large as we decrease the step .",
    "furthermore , the use of fourier transforms prevents efficient parallelization in spatial domains which in turns limits the size of the largest simulation box to a single computational node memory . on the other end",
    ", spm is less limited from the computational stand point , but is unreliable especially in the strong - field regime .",
    "this is due to the strong assumptions that it needs which are difficult to assess and in turn require comparatively large simulations boxes to appropriately converge .",
    "a promising alternative method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a preliminary version of the same method in ref .",
    "@xcite  the time - dependent surface flux method ( t  surff ) .",
    "surff  has been so far employed only for few - electron systems either with tdse  @xcite or in combination with multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree - fock  @xcite . in this paper , we extend this method for the first time to tddft . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present the theory alongside the sampling point and mask methods to illustrate differences and common traits and proceed with a real world comparison on a characteristic set of examples in sec .  [ sec : examples ] . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves here and following to spin - unpolarized many - electron systems .",
    "nevertheless , all expressions and calculations can be trivially extended to include spin polarization .",
    "atomic units will be used throughout ( @xmath11 ) unless otherwise indicated .",
    "below , we formally present the theoretical framework and assumptions that are common to all the three methods detailed in the next sections . in this paper",
    ", we describe the many - body electron dynamics at the level of tddft  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the electronic density of a many - body system @xmath12 is obtained from an auxiliary one  the kohn - sham ( ks ) system  of non - interacting fermions which wavefunction is represented by a single slater determinant @xmath13 composed of @xmath14 orbitals @xmath15 .",
    "these orbitals satisfy the time - dependent ks equations @xmath16 with the time - dependent ks  hamiltonian @xmath17({\\mathbf{r}};t ) = -\\frac{\\delta}{2}+v_\\mathrm{ks}[\\rho]({\\mathbf{r}};t)\\:,\\ ] ] and the time - dependent ks  potential @xmath18({\\mathbf{r}};t )    = v_\\mathrm{ext}({\\mathbf{r}};t)+\\int d^3r'\\,\\frac{\\rho({\\mathbf{r}}';t)}{|{\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r}}'| }    + v_\\mathrm{xc}[\\rho]({\\mathbf{r}};t)\\:,\\ ] ] composed by the external field of the ions and the laser field , the classical hartree and the exchange and correlation ( xc ) potential .",
    "once the time - dependent density is obtained by solving these equations , it is in principle possible to access any kind of observable provided it is expressed as a functional of @xmath19 .    the momentum probability distribution of emitted electrons @xmath20 , i.e. the probability to measure an electron with momentum @xmath21 at a detector positioned far away from a target system , is the observable we aim to describe . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the formulations that can be applied to real - space implementations and that require the knowledge of the wavefunction in a limited volume .",
    "all these approaches are resting on two principal assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is that the dynamics of ionization can be accurately described by two different hamiltonians localized in adjacent spatial regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 separated by a surface @xmath24 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch - tsurff ]  we here choose a spherical surface of radius @xmath25 , but the shape can be general . more specifically , we assume that in @xmath22 the electrons can be described with the ks hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : hks ] while in @xmath23 they follow the exactly solvable volkov hamiltonian     ( here chosen as spherical ) separates the space into region @xmath22 which is described by tddft and the volkov propagation region @xmath23 . ]",
    "@xmath26 ^ 2    \\label{eq : volkovhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    governing the time evolution of free electrons in an external field @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the total time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath28 describing our system can be expressed as a combination of these two spatially localized hamitonians , @xmath29 and that electrons in @xmath23 can be safely described as free , independent particles .",
    "the quality of such an assumption is limited by the error in the truncation of the tail of the coulomb potential and ultimately depends on the position of @xmath24 relative to the target system . while this is exact in the proximity of the detector  at an infinite distance  and certainly bad in the vicinity of the system  where electrons are strongly interacting with each other and with the external potential ",
    "its range of applicability in many relevant situations is quite large . in practice",
    ", however , one has to converge the final results with respect to @xmath24 .    under the assumption that the space partitioning is a good approximation",
    ", we can represent the wavefunction in @xmath23 with a ks slater determinant @xmath30 yet expand each orbital @xmath31 on volkov waves as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 ^ 2\\:\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the exact solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the volkov hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : volkovhamiltonian ] , @xmath34 is the volkov phase and @xmath35 is the spectral amplitude of the @xmath36th ks orbital .",
    "volkov waves are essentially plane waves with an additional time - dependent phase .",
    "the second assumption is that in the long time limit , for @xmath37 , bound and ionized electronic wavefunctions are well localized in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . in other words",
    ", we demand that the total density is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) being the @xmath36th ks  orbital localized in @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) at time @xmath42 .",
    "this is exact for @xmath43 , while for finite values of @xmath42 one has to propagate for a time long enough such that slowest escaping electrons have reached region @xmath23 .    under the former assumptions the total number of electrons escaped from @xmath22 at time  @xmath42 , which is precisely the integral of the total density in @xmath23 ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath44 where we used eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] to obtain the rightmost expression .",
    "since the momentum distribution @xmath20 is the differential probability associated with the total number of escaped electrons we can use the completeness of volkov functions to invert eq .  [ eq : expansion ] and obtain that @xmath45 from this equation it is apparent how @xmath20 connects with the spectral amplitude @xmath35 of the scattering orbitals expanded on volkov waves . less resolved quantities , like the energy - resolved photoelectron probability @xmath46 , can be obtained from @xmath20 by direct integration .",
    "the three methods which we describe in the next sections , essentially provide different approaches to obtain @xmath35 from the knowledge of the ks orbitals in @xmath22 only .",
    "our aim is to have an expression for @xmath35 which can be efficiently implemented in a real space three dimensional representation , that is accurate from linear to strong - field regimes and with an energy resolution comparable to experiment ( @xmath47 ev ) . as we will show in the following ,",
    "the spm is straightforward to implement efficiently and provides a large flexibility in reciprocal space .",
    "however , it is unreliable in the mid- to strong - field regimes where it requires the use of unpractically large simulation boxes to properly converge under its working assumptions .",
    "mm , in contrast , yields reliable and precise results in all regimes , however , a computationally efficient implementation is more involved as fourier transforms are needed . moreover , when using this method the reciprocal space grid is constrained by the choice of the real - space one and spectra at low kinetic energies are difficult to retrieve .",
    "surff  can be derived in a tddft formalism without any additional assumptions .",
    "the grid in momentum space can be chosen arbitrarily which allows the calculation of pes and pad up to high precision and resolution .",
    "furthermore , by introducing an additional parameter ( the angular momentum cut - off @xmath48 ) the method can be efficiently implemented in three dimensions .",
    "the sampling point method ( spm ) is the oldest and least accurate amongst the methods we discuss in this work  @xcite .",
    "it was first presented without formal theoretical derivation and justified only on the basis of its results on practical calculations .",
    "we hereby present a derivation with particular attention to the conditions under which it is supposed to work reliably .",
    "the spm is based on the idea that @xmath20 can be calculated by the simple knowledge of the time dependence of each orbital sampled only at a single point @xmath49 of the surface @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch - tsurff ] . besides the assumptions discussed in the previous section , it rests on the additional conditions that _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath49 is positioned at a sufficiently large distance such that the ionized wavepackets arrive when the laser pulse has been switched off ( for @xmath50 ) and _ ( ii ) _ with a final momentum directed along @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath51 .    under these conditions",
    "we can drop the field @xmath52 in the volkov phase which then describes free particles , and explicitly write the expansion of eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] as @xmath53 where we express the momentum vector in spherical coordinates @xmath54 to stress the form enforced to the final momentum by condition ( ii ) .",
    "a fourier transform in the time domain is then sufficient to impose the free particle dispersion relation , @xmath55 , and extract the volkov amplitudes with the following result @xmath56 to obtain the above relation we used the time condition ( i ) and the dirac delta @xmath57 resulting from the time integral to simplify eq .",
    "[ eq : sampling ] . at this point",
    "the momentum distribution probability can be straightforwardly obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : pk_def ] as @xmath58 where we explicitly inverted the dispersion relation to obtain the momentum magnitude @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that @xmath60 is always positive and therefore we must further impose that _",
    "( iii ) _ at the sampling point , the electrons are strictly outgoing .    the spm working conditions are asymptotically valid for @xmath49 positioned at an infinitely large distance from the system , but quickly degrade as we move closer .",
    "the most stringent condition is the time constraint ( i ) since it directly forces @xmath49 to be positioned at a distance that proportionally grows with the laser switch - off time @xmath61 .",
    "a simple way to overcome this limitation was proposed in ref .",
    "it substantially reduces to keeping the full volkov phase , including the field , in the expansion of eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] and to compensate it in the fourier time integral .",
    "the fourier exponent @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ eq : teft ] is thus substituted with the volkov phase @xmath63 evaluated at @xmath64 , @xmath65 the photoelectron momentum distribution is then obtained by simply replacing @xmath66 with @xmath67 in eq .  [ eq : raw ] . owing to the presence of the volkov phase in the time integral",
    "this variant goes under the name of phase - augmented sampling point method ( pa - spm ) .    even though this approach is superior to the simple spm , it is still limited by conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the validity of these conditions is difficult to assess in practical calculations since it strongly depends on the electron dynamics induced by the external field and can only be taken under control by converging the final results with respect to the position of @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast to the spm , the time - dependent surface flux method  ( t  surff )  @xcite makes no further assumption besides the ones discussed in sec .  [ sec : partitioning ] .",
    "thus , for instance , it can handle situations where electrons are driven by the laser field back towards the emission site like in the backscattering regime .",
    "we here describe a derivation alternative to the one present in the literature .",
    "our derivation is based on the flux of the current - density operator through @xmath24  ( see the scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch - tsurff ] ) that is suitable for tddft .    owing to the space and hamiltonian partitioning explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : partitioning ] , we can describe the electronic wavefunctions with both @xmath68 and @xmath69 on the surface @xmath24 that separates region @xmath22 and @xmath23 . using the continuity equation",
    "we thus express the total number of escaped electron @xmath70 at time @xmath42 in terms of the flux integral @xmath71 of the single - particle , gauge - invariant , current - density operator @xmath72\\:,\\ ] ] evaluated over @xmath68 and @xmath69 or the orbitals which they are composed of .",
    "we then replace the bra in eq .",
    "[ eq : nesc3 ] and insert the expansion eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] in volkov states @xmath73 with @xmath74 . since the choice of the subscript @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the brakets of eq .",
    "[ eq : nesc3 ] is arbitrary , we can equivalently choose the opposite order and obtain that @xmath75 is also equal to eq .",
    "[ eq : nesc2 ] complex conjugated . comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq : nesc1 ] with [ eq : nesc2 ] and its complex conjugated for each single orbital yields the final expression for the spectral amplitude @xmath76 in terms of the volkov projected single - particle current density @xmath77 .",
    "the momentum probability distribution @xmath20 can then be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : pk_def ] by summing up @xmath78 over the orbital index @xmath36 .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] it is apparent that the extension to tddft is straightforward . in practical implementations",
    "one needs to calculate @xmath79 for a given set of @xmath21 and accumulate its flux integral over time . to this end",
    ", one needs only to keep track of the ks orbitals @xmath80 and their gradients over @xmath24 while the volkov waves ( and their gradients ) are analytical . in principle , provided @xmath24 is positioned far enough from the system , there is no restriction to the choice of its shape .",
    "however , we found that a spherical surface is advantageous from the numerical standpoint as it allows to expand the volkov waves in spherical harmonics to decouple @xmath21 and @xmath81 .",
    "this in turn , requires to truncate the integrals over the sphere up to a given maximum angular momentum @xmath48 and thus introduces an additional parameter to converge ( see appendix  a ) . in practice",
    ", we observed that @xmath82 is enough for a large class of problems involving moderately strong fields ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that a variant of the sampling point method can be derived by truncating the surface integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] to a single point ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "this leads to an alternative expression similar to the one for pa - spm . in our tests",
    ", however , we found that this variant did not present any significant improvement over pa - spm and therefore we did not develop it further .",
