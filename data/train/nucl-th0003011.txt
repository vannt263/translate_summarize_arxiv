    "in the long history of the shell model , elliott was the first to point out the advantage of using a deformed ( intrinsic ) many - body basis and developed the @xmath0 shell model @xcite for @xmath2-shell nuclei . in this model , the classification of basis states and their projection onto good angular momentum can be carried out using group theory .",
    "it works nicely as long as the spin - orbit force is weak . in heavier nuclei , where the presence of a strong spin - orbit force is essential for the correct shell closures , the high-@xmath3 orbital in an @xmath4-shell",
    "is strongly pushed down by this interaction and intrudes into a lower @xmath4-shell .",
    "this results in a re - classification of basis states and the elliott @xmath0 scheme is no longer valid for heavy nuclei .",
    "however , in early work of bhatt , parikh and mcgrory @xcite , it was shown that wave functions for yrast states of deformed nuclei in the @xmath5-@xmath6 shell that were obtained in shell model calculations within a severely truncated configuration space that can not support microscopic @xmath0 symmetry of elliott , have @xmath0-like structures when the wave function of a state with total angular momentum @xmath7 is expressed in terms of coupling of the collective neutron and proton angular momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 within the truncated configuration space .",
    "on the basis of this analysis , they suggested that the rotational features of yrast states in heavy , deformed nuclei could be due to a similar manifestation of @xmath0 symmetry occurring at the macroscopic level , even if it is absent at the single particle level in the usual basis .",
    "brink et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an alternative derivation without the use of symmetry arguments as well as the assumption of the motion of a particle in a static deformed field .",
    "instead they approached the problem by diagonalising a rotationally invariant hamiltonian using basis states of good angular momentum at all stages , which leads to the standard ` symmetrised ' wavefunctions .    in our recent letter @xcite ,",
    "the connection between the numerically calculated states of heavy nuclear system and such macroscopic @xmath0 symmetry states has been explored .",
    "the work was based on an extended projected shell model ( psm ) .",
    "starting from a deformed potential , instead of employing only one bcs vacuum as in the original projected shell model @xcite , we use independent bcs condensates for neutrons and protons to construct separate bases for neutron and proton collective rotational states by exact angular momentum projection .",
    "the active nucleons in the model space were permitted to occupy three full major shells , which is a space far larger than a conventional shell model can handle .",
    "these rotational states were then coupled by diagonalizing a residual pairing plus quadrupole interaction .",
    "many new bands emerge that are not contained in the original psm , and it was shown that these bands exhibit a nearly perfect @xmath0 spectrum , even though there is no explicit dynamical symmetry in such a model .",
    "our work @xcite demonstrates a clear connection between a numerical microscopic method , which starts from certain set of intrinsic states , and an elegant group theoretical description of nuclear states .",
    "thus the psm may be viewed as a natural method to investigate the emergence of @xmath0 symmetry as a truly dynamical symmetry in heavy , deformed nuclear systems .",
    "the present paper elaborates on our previous letter @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the extended psm with an emphasis on how to treat coupled rotations of neutron and proton systems .",
    "it is shown that this treatment generalizes the original psm by allowing for relative motion between the neutron and proton systems . in section 3 , we give details of the calculation for an example , @xmath10er .",
    "a much richer spectrum is obtained after diagonalization than from the usual psm . with the help of group theory ,",
    "the states obtained from the diagonalization are shown to possess a strong @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we further demonstrate that these states can be classified as rotational bands built on spin-@xmath11 phonon excitations , and we suggest that these correspond to a geometrical scissors mode and its generalizations .",
    "these states are interpreted in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we buttress our conclusions by comparing the angular momentum distribution in our deformed basis states and the intrinsic states of the @xmath0 model , and by evaluating overlaps of our total wave functions with the @xmath0 ones",
    ". then we calculate @xmath12 values from the psm wave functions to further confirm the state classifications .",
    "some comments about the emergent @xmath0 symmetry and about a possible relation to scissors mode vibrations are made in section 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the lowest excitation bands , the first 1@xmath13 and the first 2@xmath13 band , as well as the second 0@xmath13 band , are further discussed in section 8 .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper in section 9 .",
    "the shell model is the most fundamental way of describing many - nucleon systems fully quantum mechanically .",
    "however , using the shell model to study deformed heavy nuclei is a desirable but very difficult task because of large dimensionality and its related problems .",
    "even with today s computer power , the best standard shell model diagonalization can be done only in the full @xmath14-shell space , as for example in the work of the strasbourg ",
    "madrid group @xcite , for which the dimension of the configuration space is well over one million .",
    "the psm provides one possible solution for this difficulty . in this approach ,",
    "one first truncates the configuration space with guidance from the deformed mean field by selecting only the bcs vacuum plus a few quasiparticle configurations in the nilsson orbitals around the fermi surface , performs angular momentum projection ( and particle number projection if required ) to obtain a set of laboratory - frame basis states , and finally diagonalizes a shell - model hamiltonian in this space .",
    "since the deformed mean field + bcs vacuum already incorporates strong particle - hole and particle - particle correlations , this truncation should be appropriate for the low - lying states dominated by quadrupole and pairing collectivity .",
    "indeed , this approach has been very successful for ground band ( g - band ) properties and near - yrast quasiparticle excitations in high - spin physics for both normally deformed and superdeformed states @xcite .",
    "however , in this formalism the basis vacuum is the usual bcs condensate of neutrons and protons in a fixed deformed potential ( fixed shape in the geometric models ) . without quasiparticle excitations ,",
    "one obtains only the g - band after angular momentum projection .",
    "thus , there is no room for studying any other collective excitations .",
    "it is known that small perturbations of nuclear shapes and relative orientations around the equilibrium can give rise to physical states at low to moderate excitation energies .",
    "classical examples of such motion include @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations @xcite , in which neutrons and protons undergo vibrations as a collective system .",
    "these small - amplitude motions are not built into the ground state for theories like hartree  fock  bogoliubov or bcs .",
    "one may obtain the @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations by building additional correlations into the ground state , as for example in the random phase approximation ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or by enriching the intrinsic degrees of freedom in the deformed potential @xcite .",
    "another possible mode of collective motion results if we consider neutron and proton fields of the fixed deformation , but permit small oscillations in the relative orientations of these fields @xcite .",
    "this geometric picture may be related to the two - rotor model @xcite .",
    "because of the strong restoring force @xcite ( with its physical origin in the neutron - proton interaction ) , this oscillation is confined to a small angle between the protons and neutrons ( thus it is termed small - amplitude scissors motion ) .",
    "this vibration , and the @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations , can be classified using group theoretical methods ; they belong to the lowest collective excitations of the ground state , as pointed out by iachello @xcite .",
    "as introduced in our previous letter @xcite , in order to study microscopically the relative motion between neutron and proton intrinsic states with a fixed deformation , we have extended the original psm in the following manner : instead of a single bcs vacuum , the angular momentum projection is now performed for separate neutron and proton deformed bcs vacua .",
    "although the introduction of two separately projected bcs vacua seems to treat neutrons and protons as two independent systems , the equal deformation used in the nilsson calculation of the basis already contains strong correlation between the two systems @xcite .",
    "further proton - neutron correlations are introduced by explicitly diagonalizing the total hamiltonian in the basis formed by the angular momentum projected neutron and proton states .",
    "this procedure gives the usual g - band corresponding to the coherently coupled bcs condensate of neutrons and protons , but also leads to a new set of states built on a more complex vacuum that incorporates fluctuations in the relative orientation of the neutron and proton fields of constant deformation .",
    "the neutron and proton valence spaces employed in the present work are those of ref .",
    "our single particle space contains three major shells ( @xmath4 = 4 , 5 , and 6 ) for neutrons and ( @xmath4 = 3 , 4 and 5 ) for protons ; this has been shown to be sufficient for a quantitative description of rare - earth g - bands and bands built on a few quasiparticle excitations @xcite .",
    "separable forces of pairing plus quadrupole type @xcite are used in our hamiltonian .",
    "we note that a recent study by dufour and zuker @xcite has shown explicitly that the residual part of the realistic force is strongly dominated by pairing and quadrupole interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xcite can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the like - particle pairing plus quadrupole hamiltonian , with inclusion of quadrupole - pairing , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the n  p quadrupole  quadrupole residual interaction @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , the four terms are , respectively , the spherical single - particle energy which contains a proper spin - orbit force @xcite , the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction , the monopole - pairing , and the quadrupole - pairing interaction .",
    "the interaction strengths @xmath23 ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) are related self - consistently to the deformation @xmath26 by @xcite @xmath27 obviously , neutrons and protons are coupled by the self - consistency condition . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the strength @xmath28 is assumed to be @xmath29 .",
    "similar parameterizations were used in earlier work @xcite .    in this paper , we concentrate on collective motion only and do not consider quasiparticle excitations ; however , we shall discuss possible physical implication of including quasiparticle states in a later section .",
    "particle number projection is not included , so particle number is conserved only on average in the bcs calculation .",
    "it has been shown by a systematic calculation @xcite that particle number projection does not alter the unprojected results very much for those well - deformed heavy nuclei .",
    "we do not expect that particle number projection will change conclusions of this paper with respect to the emergence of @xmath0 symmetry .",

    "all these results strongly support the conclusion that the structure of well deformed nuclei resulting from psm calculations indeed possesses a very strong @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the connection between @xmath0 symmetry and nuclear rotation has a long history .",
    "it was first explored by elliott in his classic 1958 papers @xcite for @xmath2-shell nuclei .",
    "this idea was later extended to heavy systems using the pseudo-@xmath0 model @xcite , which showed that it is possible to represent approximately the ground band of a deformed nucleus by one leading @xmath0 representation belonging only to the normal parity nucleons in a single major shell .",
    "however this model has difficulty in reproducing @xmath15-bands of heavy nuclei , and quantitative results generally do not appear in simple symmetry limits and therefore require numerical calculations .",
    "later , the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite demonstrated that nuclear rotational motion including @xmath15- and @xmath16-bands can be described by an @xmath0 dynamical symmetry based on @xmath227-@xmath39 or @xmath227-@xmath39-@xmath228 bosons . the fermion dynamical symmetry model ( fdsm ) , based on the @xmath229-@xmath230 fermion pairs of normal parity nucleons in a major shell , demonstrated analytically the equivalence between the particle  rotor model and the @xmath0 dynamical symmetry limit of the fdsm when particle number @xmath231 ; if the pauli effect is neglected ( by assuming the shell pair - degeneracy @xmath232 ) the fdsm reduces to the ibm ( see section 3 and 4 in ref.@xcite ) .    however , all the above - mentioned models are algebraic and the possibility for symmetries arises naturally in them .",
    "the extended psm described here has not built an explicit @xmath0 symmetry into the problem , and no free parameters have been adjusted .",
    "nevertheless , the spectra and wavefunctions obtained from the psm calculations can again be well classified using the representation theory of the @xmath0 group .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry just _ emerges naturally _ at the macroscopic level from a shell model diagonalization in the basis obtained by angular momentum projection from a deformed intrinsic state .",
    "this is a non - trivial result because our study is not confined in the g - band , but extended up to high spins and high excitations , and because the correspondence has been demonstrated not only at the spectral level , but in the wavefunctions and electromagnetic transition rates too .",
    "this strongly indicates that a well deformed nucleus is in fact a very good @xmath0 rotor .",
    "now we may ask an important question : what is the nature of the @xmath0 symmetry that emerges from the psm ?",
    "there are many @xmath0 models .",
    "mathematically , they are equivalent _ if their representations are the equivalent_. physically , the models differ in the microscopic basis on which the symmetry is built , and have different permissible @xmath0 irreps , and thus different band structures .",
    "the emergent @xmath0 symmetry we have found here is in principle consistent with any @xmath0 symmetry model that has allowed representations consistent with the observed states and band structure .",
    "we emphasize that this is a _ physical _ rather than mathematical criterion , for it is the physical input to an @xmath0 model that determines its allowed irreps .",
    "therefore , to answer the question of which @xmath0 model is consistent with the symmetry of the well deformed rotor that we have explored in this paper , one should look at the entire band structure and not just the ground - state rotational band .    as we have already demonstrated , the @xmath0 symmetry that emerges from the psm for @xmath10er corresponds to effective @xmath233\\otimes[\\lambda_\\pi=16 , 0 ] \\ }",
    "( \\lambda , \\mu ) i$ ] irreps for neutrons and protons , respectively . among the @xmath0 models being employed in nuclear structure physics , the fdsm ( or equivalently the ibm that results if pauli effects are neglected in the fdsm ) can naturally accommodate such a representation if the shell degeneracy @xmath234 is large enough @xcite . as can be easily checked ,",
    "no other currently existing @xmath0 fermion model permits naturally such an @xmath0 representation . for example , the leading @xmath0 irreps for @xmath10er given by the pseudo-@xmath0 model @xcite would be @xmath235\\otimes [ \\lambda^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize pseudo}}_{\\pi}=10 , \\mu^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize pseudo}}_\\pi=4 ] \\ } ( \\lambda , \\mu ) i$ ] , which will give a band structure very different from what we have seen in fig .  1 .",
    "thus , we conclude that in a model such as the pseudo-@xmath0 , the @xmath0 spectrum found in the numerical psm calculation can not be reproduced by any simple symmetry limit and could emerge ( if at all ) only from a large mixing of irreps through numerical diagonalization .",
    "however , it should be noted that although we have demonstrated that the @xmath0 symmetry that emerges from the psm is of fdsm - type ( or the ibm - type if pauli effects are omitted ) , this does not necessarily mean that the simplest single - major shell fdsm can accommodate such an @xmath0 symmetry microscopically .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath0 symmetry which emerges for @xmath10er in the present psm calculation is the fermion dynamical @xmath0 symmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite based on @xmath229-@xmath230 fermion pairs , the @xmath0 quantum numbers @xmath236 and @xmath237 have a very simple interpretation .",
    "they are the effective number of neutrons and protons in the valence space , @xmath238 and @xmath239 , which form the coherent @xmath229-@xmath230 pairs and are responsible for the collective rotation . in the simplest implementations of the fdsm ,",
    "the model space is restricted to one major shell for protons and neutrons . the effective neutron ( proton )",
    "number @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) is just the number of neutrons ( protons ) in the normal - parity levels of a single major shell , which is obviously too small to satisfy the requirement of @xmath242 and @xmath243 for the @xmath10er case . in order to accommodate the @xmath244\\otimes[\\lambda_\\pi=16 , 0 ] \\ } ( \\lambda , \\mu ) i$ ] @xmath0 symmetry , the one - major shell fdsm has to be extended to a multi - major shell fdsm .",
    "namely , the coherent @xmath229-@xmath230 pairs should be redefined in a multi - major shell space .",
    "this has already been discussed extensively in conjunction with the extension of the fdsm to the description of superdeformation , and much of that discussion applies to the present case .",
    "one should note in this regard that there is a conceptual distinction between the @xmath0 symmetry that emerged from the psm diagonalized in multiple shells and that which arises in the one - major shell fdsm . in the psm calculations the @xmath0 symmetry arises from the explicit dynamical participation of both normal and abnormal - parity nucleons ,",
    "while in the symmetry limit of the single one - major shell fdsm the @xmath0 symmetry itself arises entirely from the normal - parity nucleons and the abnormal parity orbital enters only implicitly through the pauli effect and by renormalizing the @xmath0 parameters .",
    "thus , the multi - major shell fdsm is also necessary to resolve this conceptual ambiguity .",
    "the reason that the one - major shell fdsm treats the contribution of the abnormal - parity component to the collective motion differently from normal parity orbitals is because in a single major shell there is only one abnormal parity level .",
    "it has been shown that a single-@xmath3 shell does not have enough quadrupole collectivity ( the possibility to form a @xmath230 pair in the @xmath245 intruder level compared to that in the corresponding normal - parity levels is only @xmath246 ; see ref .",
    "when the fdsm is extended to a three - shell valence space as in the psm , the situation will be changed .",
    "a bunch of abnormal - parity levels , which are located just below the normal - parity levels , will open up .",
    "abnormal - parity nucleons thus have enough collectivity to form coherent @xmath230 pairs and participate in collective motion .",
    "this idea has already been developed in the extension of the fdsm to superdeformation .",
    "although the basic theme of the present work is that the @xmath0 symmetry - like features emerge for deformed nuclei from a realistic hamiltonian which has no such symmetry at a microscopic level , it is tempting to look for the microscopic basis underlying the emergent @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the preceding arguments give us strong reason to speculate that this emergent @xmath0 symmetry is just a manifestation of the fdsm operating over a three - shell valence space .",
    "a second important consequence of our study is that the rotational states that we have just described in terms of an @xmath0 symmetry can be regrouped and interpreted as phonon vibrations ( even though no explicit vibrational information has been given to the calculation ) .",
    "a standard signature of ideal harmonic vibrational motion is the appearance of an equally spaced spectrum of energy levels with a characteristic degeneracy pattern .",
    "a similar connection between @xmath0 symmetry and vibration in rotating nuclei was pointed out by wu _",
    "et al . _ for @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations @xcite . in the present case",
    ", we have clearly shown that the band heads of the different @xmath0 representations @xmath247 $ ] obtained by coupling the proton ",
    "neutron representations @xmath248 $ ] and @xmath249 $ ] tend to be equally spaced .",
    "we have also shown that the spectra of the states obtained by psm diagonalization is dominated by nearly equally spaced bands ( apart from a small anharmonicity ) .",
    "therefore it is appropriate to call these  vibrational bands \" .",
    "physically the only vibrational mode allowed for protons and neutrons that retain their individual @xmath0 irreps @xmath152 $ ] ( this algebraic restriction is related to a geometrical requirement of fixed deformation for both neutrons and protons ) is the  scissors mode \" .",
    "the scissors mode corresponds geometrically to an oscillation in the relative orientation angle of the quadrupole - deformed neutron and proton potentials .",
    "traditionally , collective vibrations appear as a consequence of small oscillations around the equilibrium in the deformed potential , as we know from the physics of @xmath250 and @xmath251vibrations @xcite . theories of the rpa type allow superposition of states displaced around the equilibrium , thus describing the physics of small oscillations , as required for @xmath250 and @xmath251vibrations . however",
    ", the collective vibrations considered here originate from relative motion between proton and neutron systems at fixed deformation .",
    "as long as one does not decompose the neutron and proton degrees of freedom , the physics discussed in our work is not contained in such theories .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the present results do not describe @xmath15- and @xmath16-spectra because the @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrational modes do not belong to the present configuration space .",
    "this can be seen clearly with the aid of the preceding @xmath0 classification of the psm states .",
    "the @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations ( the quadrupole phonon or spin-2@xmath1 excitations ) , correspond to a coherent superposition of the @xmath252 $ ] and @xmath253 $ ] representations with @xmath105 equal to a non - zero even integer .",
    "in other words , either the neutron or the proton core ( or both ) , must be excited .",
    "it is easy to show from eq .",
    "( [ su3h ] ) that the dominant @xmath0 representation for the lowest @xmath15- and @xmath16-bands is @xmath254 ( \\lambda-4,2)$ ] if @xmath255 .",
    "the @xmath15-band head energy is given by @xmath256 thus the @xmath15-vibrational band head energy is significantly lower than the energy @xmath257 of the lowest @xmath258 band of the scissors mode excitation shown in fig .  1 which corresponds to the @xmath259 ( \\lambda_m-4 , 2)$ ] representation .",
    "in fact , @xmath260 will be lower than even the energy @xmath261 of the band head of the first 1@xmath13 scissors mode @xmath262 , if the condition @xmath263 is fulfilled . in the case of @xmath10er",
    "discussed here , this condition becomes @xmath264 .",
    "this means that , unlike the scissors mode , the @xmath15- and @xmath16-vibrations do not correspond to relative motion between fixed neutron and proton fields , but to an internal collective excitation of neutrons or / and protons .",
    "this picture is consistent with the conventional shape vibration picture @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain the classical @xmath15- and @xmath16-bands within the present framework one must build a richer set of correlations into the vacuum . in principle , this could be achieved by mixing a large set of multi - quasiparticle states , but in practice , the configuration space may be too large to handle if there is substantial collectivity in these modes .",
    "a more efficient way to introduce these states is to build those degrees of freedom into the intrinsic basis .",
    "very recently , @xmath16-band and multi - phonon @xmath16-vibrational states in rare - earth nuclei have been obtained by sun _",
    "_ @xcite by using three - dimensional angular momentum projection on triaxially deformed potential @xcite .",
    "several lowest excited bands appearing in fig .  1 warrant further discussion . in fig .",
    "4 we plot these bands , together with the g - band from the psm calculations and from experiment @xcite .",
    "there are other observed low - lying collective states in this nucleus ( for example , the 2@xmath13 @xmath16-band starting at 0.821 mev @xcite , which was extensively studied in the psm framework in ref .",
    "discussion of these states is beyond the scope of the present paper , and therefore , we omit plotting them in fig .  4 .",
    "the first 1@xmath13 band corresponds to a 1-phonon excitation with the excitation energy relative to the ground state depending on the interaction strengths used in the calculation .",
    "the good agreement of the calculated g - band with data ( and similar results for many other calculations in this mass region @xcite ) suggests that the strengths we use here are realistic .",
    "these excitations are due to an @xmath0 coupling @xmath265 in which both neutron and proton intrinsic systems remain in the ground states ; thus they are related physically to relative motion between neutrons and protons .",
    "we conclude that this may be the 1@xmath13 scissors mode band previously suggested in other models @xcite .",
    "our obtained bandhead of this 1@xmath13 band is at an excitation of about 3 mev , reasonably within the energy range of experimental observations for scissors mode @xcite .",
    "the present results indicate that the psm provides a microscopic framework in which collective modes that may be closely identified with those proposed in earlier geometrical and algebraic descriptions emerge as the lowest excitations .",
    "furthermore , it is already well established that the psm describes structures built on quasiparticle excitation very well @xcite .",
    "therefore , the extension of the present calculations to a larger basis including 2 and possibly 4 quasiparticle excitations of the n ",
    "p coupled vacuum will provide a microscopic formalism in which collective and quasiparticle degrees of freedom enter on an equal footing .",
    "such calculations are possible and are presently being explored .",
    "we may expect that the long - debated question of whether the observed @xmath225 states are collective or two - quasiparticle in nature may then be resolved through such quantitative calculations of this sort .",
    "the other excited bands are generalizations of the scissors mode corresponding to multi - phonon excitations . in fig .  4 , the next two bands at 6.5 mev excitation energy are nearly degenerate 2-phonon states , corresponding to the coupling of two 1@xmath1-phonons to total spins 0@xmath1 and 2@xmath1 .",
    "these are theoretically predicted multi - phonon excitations of the scissors mode , and have not to our knowledge been seen experimentally .",
    "although the level density is expected to be high at that excitation energy and symmetry breaking will fractionate the strength , these predicted states might be detectable in the new generation of modern detectors .",
    "we have found many new collective states in a shell model diagonalization based on separately projected neutron and proton nilsson + bcs vacuum states .",
    "we have shown that these states exhibit an almost perfect @xmath0 symmetry , both in their spectra and their wavefunctions .",
    "we have shown also that these states can be classified systematically in a phonon spectrum with weak anharmonicity . among these states ,",
    "the lowest 1@xmath13 band at about 3 mev corresponds to the scissors mode predicted in a classical geometrical picture .",
    "the psm is a shell model diagonalization without explicit @xmath0 symmetries .",
    "however , the quantitative agreement with an @xmath0 model provides an algebraic fermion classification scheme for the states obtained from the psm diagonalization , and suggests that the projected bcs vacuum for a well - deformed system is very close to the @xmath0 dynamical symmetry limit of an @xmath229-@xmath230 pair fermion system .",
    "this in turn implies a good boson algebraic symmetry if pauli effects may be ignored .",
    "finally , we have proposed that the extension of the present calculations to include quasiparticle excitations provides a quantitative framework to determine whether `` scissors mode '' 1@xmath13 states are more properly viewed as collective excitations or as quasiparticle states .",

    "<S> we show that a nearly perfect @xmath0 symmetry emerges from an extended projected shell model . starting from a deformed potential </S>",
    "<S> we construct separate bases for neutron and proton collective rotational states by exact angular momentum projection . </S>",
    "<S> these rotational states are then coupled by diagonalizing a residual pairing plus quadrupole interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the states obtained exhibit a one - to - one correspondence with an @xmath0 spectrum up to high angular momentum and excitation , and their wave functions have a near - maximal overlap with the @xmath0 states . </S>",
    "<S> they can also be classified as rotational bands built on spin-1@xmath1 phonon excitations , which correspond to a geometrical scissors mode and its generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> this work is a direct demonstration that numerical angular momentum projection theory extends the elliott s original idea to heavy nuclear systems . </S>"
