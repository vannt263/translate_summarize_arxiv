    "there has been tremendous research interest on the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in low - dimensional condensed matter systems due to the possible applications in spin based electronic devices @xcite .",
    "the soi is responsible for many noble effects like spin - fet @xcite , metal - insulator transition in a two - dimensional hole gas @xcite , spin - resolved ballistic transport @xcite , spin - galvanic effect @xcite and spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "it is the prime interest to measure and control the soi strength experimentally because it influences the spin degree of freedom .    in absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the two - fold spin degeneracy is lifted at finite momentum of the electron due to the soi . in semiconductor heterostructures , there are mainly two mechanisms responsible for giving rise to the zero - field spin splitting : the dresselhaus interaction@xcite which varies as @xmath0 and the rashba interaction @xcite which varies linear with @xmath1 .",
    "the former is due to the inversion asymmetry of the crystals and the later is due to the asymmetric quantum wells .",
    "the dresselhaus interaction dominates in the wide - gap semiconductors with small thickness whereas the rashba interaction dominates in narrow - gap semiconductors due to their different momentum dependence @xcite .",
    "the electric field generated in the asymmetric quantum wells produces the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the soi can also be tuned by a strong external electric field perpendicular to the planar motion of the electrons .",
    "a direct manifestation of the spin - split levels due to the soi is a beating pattern in the sdh oscillations due to the two closely spaced different frequency of the spin - up and spin - down electrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the rashba interaction produces regular beating patterns in the sdh oscillations whereas the dresselhaus interaction produces anomalous beating patterns .",
    "the soi strength is measured by analyzing the beating patterns in the sdh oscillations .    the experimental evidence , by using the magnetotransport and cyclotron resonance measurement , of zero - field spin splitting is found in a modulation doped gaas / algaas heterojunction @xcite .",
    "it was first explained by bychkov and rashba based on the spin - orbit interaction produced in the asymmetric quantum wells @xcite .",
    "the zero - field spin splitting is related to the fermi wave vector @xmath2 and the soi strength @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "the rashba soi is considered to be the appropriate term for observing the zero - field spin splitting in low - dimensional quantum systems , particularly in narrow gap semiconductors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the beating patterns in the sdh oscillations have been found in gasb / inas quantum wells and confirmed that the lifting of the spin degeneracy is due to the rashba soi .",

    "@xcite investigated the sdh oscillations in a series of three different modulation - doped heterostructures with high electron densities and confirmed that the lifting of the spin degeneracy is due to the rashba soi .",
    "there are many advanced technique to control the soi strength in 2deg of different materials by varying the gate voltage @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zero - field spin splitting energy and hence the rashba soi strength were determined by extrapolating data and by using the model calculations for the sdh oscillations .",
    "later , the zero - field spin splitting energy was studied theoretically based on the difference between the landau energy levels @xcite and the self - consistent born approximation @xcite .",
    "the estimated soi strength was in good agreement with the extrapolated results obtained in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a very simple and elegant way to determine the zero - field spin splitting energy .",
    "the analytical expressions of the sdh oscillations for the spin - up and spin - down electrons are also obtained .",
    "the total magnetoconductivity shows beating patterns in the sdh oscillations due to two closely spaced different frequencies of the sdh oscillations for spin - up and spin - down electrons . by analyzing the beating patterns",
    ", we find a very simple equation to determine the zero - field spin splitting energy from the location of any beat node .",
    "we also explain analytically the non - periodic behavior of the beating patterns and the number of oscillations between two successive nodes .",
