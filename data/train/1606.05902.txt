    "in @xcite , we defined a very flexible notion of suborbifold and characterized those suborbifolds which can arise as the images of orbifold embeddings .",
    "in particular , suborbifolds are images of orbifold embeddings if and only if they are _ saturated _ and _",
    "split_. for manifolds , it is a fundamental result of differential topology that submanifolds are precisely the images of embeddings , and in fact , many authors use this characterization as the definition of submanifold .",
    "thus , we were surprised to find examples of suborbifolds that were not images of orbifold embeddings . because of these examples , we began to look at the issue of orbifold substructure inheritance for three orbifolds @xmath0 . to do this , we first look more deeply at the definition of suborbifold and identify an appealing but ultimately inadequate notion of an inherited canonical orbifold substructure .",
    "the appeal comes from the fact that certain choices in the definition of suborbifold can be made in a unique way .",
    "the inadequacy comes from the observation that these unique canonical suborbifold structures do not persist through inclusion .",
    "in particular , we give a concrete example of three orbifolds @xmath0 , where the orbifold structure of @xmath1 is canonically inherited from @xmath2 , and the orbifold structure of @xmath2 is canonically inherited from @xmath3 , but the orbifold structure of @xmath1 is not canonically inherited from @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath1 is embedded in @xmath2 , and @xmath2 is embedded in @xmath3 , that all of the canonical inherited orbifold substructures will agree . to be clear , by embedded ,",
    "we mean realized as the image of an orbifold embedding @xcite . in some ways ,",
    "this phenomenon can be considered an orbifold structure analog of the difference between one - to - one immersions and embeddings in differential topology .",
    "that is , the topology induced by the immersion may not agree with the relative topology of its image . in the orbifold context",
    ", one could say we have  immersed \" orbifold substructures that are not  embedded , \" although we do not use or define these terms .",
    "we also investigate further the property of saturation , and give an example of a suborbifold with the canonical orbifold substructure that is not saturated .",
    "all of the following definitions come from our article @xcite and the references therein ( especially , @xcite )",
    ". this will be our standard reference for orbifold background material .",
    "we also assume the reader is familiar with the definition of a smooth orbifold modeled after thurston @xcite .",
    "such orbifolds are referred to as classical effective orbifolds in @xcite . as such ,",
    "each point @xmath4 in a smooth orbifold @xmath3 , has a neighborhood @xmath5 or orbifold chart @xmath6 or @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a homeomorphism , and @xmath10 . in the 4-tuple notation , we are making explicit the ( faithful ) representation @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 are the group of smooth diffeomorphisms that leave the origin fixed .",
    "the _ isotropy group of @xmath4 _ is the group @xmath13 .",
    "it is unique up to isomorphism . by the bochner - cartan theorem @xcite ,",
    "the smooth action of @xmath14 is smoothly conjugate to the linear action on @xmath15 given by the differential of the action .",
    "so without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath16 .",
    "these charts are subject to overlap compatibility conditions that give @xmath3 its orbifold structure .",
    "more detail can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now recall several definitions related to the notion of suborbifold from @xcite :    [ suborbifold ] a _ suborbifold _ @xmath17 of an orbifold @xmath18 consists of the following :    1 .",
    "a subspace @xmath19 equipped with the subspace topology .",
    "[ flexibledef ] for each @xmath20 and neighborhood @xmath21 of @xmath4 in @xmath22 there is an orbifold chart @xmath23 about @xmath4 in @xmath18 with @xmath24 , a subgroup @xmath25 of the isotropy group of @xmath4 in @xmath18 and a @xmath26 invariant submanifold @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 is an orbifold chart for @xmath2 , where @xmath29 .",
    "( in particular , the _ intrinsic _ isotropy subgroup at @xmath30 is @xmath31 ) .",
    "3 .   for @xmath4 in @xmath2",
    ", @xmath32 is an orbifold chart .",
    "implicit in this definition is the requirement that the invariant submanifolds @xmath33 be smooth , and that the collection of charts @xmath34 satisfy the overlap compatibility conditions of an orbifold , thus giving @xmath2 the structure of a smooth orbifold .",
    "as previously noted , condition ( [ flexibledef ] ) is not very restrictive ( see @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by thurston s notion of suborbifold @xcite , we made the following definition :    [ fullsuborbifolddef ] @xmath35 is a _ full suborbifold _ of @xmath3 if @xmath2 is a suborbifold with @xmath36 for all @xmath30 .",
    "when necessary for clarity , we will use the notation @xmath37 to denote the intrinsic isotropy group of a point @xmath4 in an orbifold @xmath3 , and use the subscript @xmath3 as well on needed subgroups of @xmath37 .",
    "when the base point @xmath4 is clear , we may drop it as well . in the case of a suborbifold @xmath35",
    "we always have the following exact sequence of groups    @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the intrinsic isotropy group of @xmath2 at @xmath4 .    in characterizing those suborbifolds that are images of orbifold embeddings in @xcite , we identified the following two conditions .",
    "[ splitsuborbifolddef ] we say that @xmath35 is a _ split _",

    "another way to think about this is that if @xmath2 is covered at @xmath4 by a chart @xmath54 , then the group @xmath55 is completely determined when @xmath2 carries the canonical orbifold substructure inherited from @xmath3 .    it is also clear that a saturated suborbifold @xmath35 has the canonical orbifold substructure inherited from @xmath3 .",
    "since embedded suborbifolds are both saturated and split @xcite , and the composition of orbifold embeddings is an orbifold embedding , it follows that in the case @xmath1 is embedded in @xmath2 , and @xmath2 is embedded in @xmath3 , that all of the canonical inherited orbifold substructures will agree .",
    "[ canonicalvssaturatedex ] to illustrate some of these definitions , we revisit the following examples which are all in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that any full suborbifold carries a canonical suborbifold structure .",

    "each of these suborbifolds are saturated .",
    "furthermore , the suborbifolds of example  13 , which are arguably the most counterintuitive ( @xcite ) examples presented in @xcite , do not carry inherited canonical orbifold substructures .",
    "they differ from the other examples in that none of these suborbifolds are saturated .",
    "lastly , we d like to point out that a recent preprint of weilandt @xcite expanded on our work in @xcite and includes a detailed discussion of the challenges surrounding the notion of suborbifold . for weilandt , however , all suborbifolds are saturated although his notion of full suborbifold turns out to be the same as ours . as pointed out earlier , saturated suborbifolds already possess the canonical orbifold substructure . in section  [ canvssatsection ] , we show that a suborbifold can possess the canonical orbifold substructure , but not be saturated .",

    "before we construct our example , we will unwind the definition of @xmath113 for reference , even though we do not need its full generality in our construction .      to unwind @xmath114 , it is best to think geometrically .",
