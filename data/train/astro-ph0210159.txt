    "the very large reynolds numbers ( defined as the ratio of the inertial force to the viscous force acting on a parcel of gas ) clearly suggest that the interstellar medium is turbulent .",
    "understanding of this turbulence is crucial to the correct and complete description of many physical processes that take place in the ism : molecular cloud dynamics , star formation , heat transfer , magnetic reconnection , accretion disks , cosmic ray propagation and diffusion , just to mention a few .    to adequately describe turbulence we need to use statistical methods , to extract the underlying regularities and reject incidental details .",
    "so far , studies of turbulence statistics have been most successful using interstellar scintillations , and have provided important information of the density statistics on scales @xmath0 , ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are done with the ionised media , and are restricted to the density fluctuations .",
    "we expect to observe power - law power spectrum of density in a turbulent medium , however density fluctuations alone fail to distinguish between fossil and active turbulence .",
    "the distribution of sizes of sand grains in a beach follows a power - law but it is not turbulence .",
    "therefore would be better to study a more direct and dynamically important statistic : velocity fluctuations .",
    "studies of the neutral media have included velocity information , e.g. using spectral line widths , centroids of velocity @xcite ; or more fancy statistics @xcite .",
    "turbulence statistics is a very important link between theory and observations .",
    "recent breakthroughs in turbulence studies have been possible with the use of scaling laws ( see reviews by @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "scaling laws predictions can be confronted with observations .",
    "a discussion of various approaches to the study of turbulence with spectral line data can be found in @xcite .",
    "in particular the problem of the contribution of velocity and density fluctuations to the emissivity statistics was addressed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lp00 ) , where analytical description of the power spectrum of the emissivity in velocity channels was obtained .",
    "this study provides a technique to extract statistics of density and velocity from spectral line data cubes .",
    "has been chosen as a test case because it was possible to disregard self - absorption , and consider the emissivity linearly depending on the density ( see review in @xcite ) .",
    "the technique , termed as velocity - channel analysis ( or simply , vca ) , is based on the variations of the power spectra in velocity channels with the change of velocity resolution .",
    "predictions in lp00 have been confirmed through observations @xcite .",
    "the first tests using numerical data in @xcite also confirmed the predictions in lp00 .",
    "however they did not address the problems of numerical noise , effects of magnetic field and galactic shear .",
    "moreover the study of velocity - density correlations was performed over a very limited dynamical range .    in this work",
    "we subject the predictions in lp00 to further scrutiny .",
    "in particular , we systematically analyse the effects of velocity - density correlations , and unlike @xcite we include a study of the effect of shear .",
    "in addition we address the issue of an anisotropic turbulent cascade , with their implications on the vca .",
    "we also analyse the sources of numerical noise .    in ",
    "@xmath1 we review the basic problem , we then (  @xmath2 ) test the extraction of the spectral indices using the vca , and obtain the density - velocity correlations . in  @xmath3 we study the effect of shear in the vca . the anisotropic cascade , and a possible new method to extract information of the magnetic field direction can be found in  @xmath4 .",
    "and we finally provide a summary of our results (  @xmath5 ) .",
    "spectral line observations contain important information of density and velocity .",
    "the problem is that both velocity fluctuations and density fluctuations contribute to the intensity of a spectral line at a given velocity , and their separation is far from trivial .",
    "turbulence , due to its stochastic nature is studied using statistical tools , such as 3d correlation and structure functions ( see @xcite ) . for instance , the density correlation function can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spatial position ( @xmath8 in cartesian coordinates ) , @xmath9 is a spatial separation ( or ` lag ' ) , and the angular brackets denote an average to be performed over all @xmath7 space .",
    "the power spectrum provides an alternative description and is related to the correlation function ( cf ) as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wave - number , related to the scale under study like @xmath12 , and the integration is performed over all 3d space . for power - law statistics , the @xmath13 dimensional power spectrum ( @xmath14 ) and the correlation ( @xmath15 )",
    "have indices related as @xmath16 , in other words , with @xmath17 positive ) .",
    "however , it was introduced in lp00 , and for consistency we adhere to it . ]",

    "it differs from the correlation function only by a constant .",
    "therefore for power - law statistics it has the same spectral index @xmath20 as the correlation function ( i. e. @xmath21 ) . for instance , kolmgorov turbulence scales as @xmath22 , which corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "in spectroscopic observations we do nt observe the gas distribution in real space coordinates @xmath24 .",
    "instead the intensity of the emission in a given spectral line is measured towards some direction in the sky , given by @xmath25 , and at a given line - of - sight ( los ) velocity @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the coordinates of observational data are @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , observational data are contained in , so called , position - position - velocity ( or simply ` ppv ' ) cubes .",
    "if we identify the @xmath28 coordinate with the los , then the relation between the real space and ppv descriptions is that of a map @xmath29 .    at a given position @xmath7 the los component of the velocity @xmath26 can be decomposed as a regular flow velocity @xmath30 , plus a thermal component @xmath31 and a turbulent component @xmath32 . this way the observed doppler shifted atoms",

    "this expression just counts the number of atoms along the los , at a given position @xmath40 with a @xmath28 component of velocity in the interval @xmath41 $ ] , and the limits of integration are defined by the extent of spatial distribution of emitting gas .",
    "the statistics available in ppv are the correlation functions , @xmath42 , and the power spectra ( this can be 1d , 2d or 3d ) of emissivity fluctuations .",
    "relations between this statistics and the underlying velocity and density spectra were established in lp00 , where the 2d power spectrum in velocity channels was used .",
    "this spectrum can be directly obtained with radio - interferometric observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this technique was developed in lp00 to extract the velocity and density spectral indices of turbulence from spectral line data .",
    "lp00 provide analytical predictions for the emissivity power spectral indices in velocity channels , as a function of the velocity resolution employed .",
    "the relative contribution to the intensity in a velocity channel ( also referred as ` slice ' ) to the total intensity fluctuations changes in a regular fashion with the width of the velocity slice .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively since more velocity fluctuations within a channel are averaged out as we increase the thickness of the channel , decreasing the relative contribution of velocity .",
    "the notation that we will use is such that : @xmath17 is the 3d density spectral index ( @xmath43 ) ; @xmath44 the 3d velocity spectral index ( @xmath45 ) ; @xmath46 corresponds to the spectral index in velocity slices ( @xmath47 ) ; and @xmath20 is the structure function index of the velocity . from eq .",
    "( [ indices_rel ] ) is clear that @xmath48    for a given 3d density power spectrum two distinct regimes are present when : a ) @xmath49 ( ` shallow ' density case ) , and ( b ) @xmath50 ( ` steep ' density case ) .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the introduced shear is the same on all scales , while the turbulent shear scales as @xmath51 .",
    "the magnitude of the external shear is the same as the magnitude of the turbulent shear when @xmath52 .",
    "therefore the external shear contributed initially to the power spectrum only at the largest scales , but eventually became important at intermediate to small scales as its magnitude increased ( see fig .",

    "the small arrows show at which wave - number the magnitude of the external shear equals the magnitude of the turbulent shear.[fig : shear],width=317 ]    our results show that the effect of an external shear becomes important only when it is comparable to the local turbulent shear . in our example that was when the maximum shear reached about @xmath4 times the velocity dispersion over the largest scale .",
    "the relative differences of the spectral indices measured compared with the case of no shear are below @xmath60 , for the cases of less shear ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "it is noticeable that the larger distortion happens at lower @xmath62 , even when its magnitude is comparable to the turbulent shear at smaller scales .",
    "this is expected , given that the shear is regular , and represents a large scale motion . and holds if we measure the slope of the power spectrum in intermediate spatial scales , which are available using synthetic data . with actual observations",
    ", we can go further into smaller scales and avoid the effects of a stronger shear .",
    "the shear due to turbulence dominates in the galaxy , and its the effect to the vca is marginal .",
    "magnetic field plays a crucial role in the dynamics of interstellar turbulence , and makes the turbulent cascade anisotropic @xcite . in a turbulent magnetized media ,",
    "the energy on the large scale motions is larger than that on the small scale structures ; however the local magnetic field strength remains almost the same .",
    "thus , is easier to bent magnetic field lines on the large scale by turbulent motions , but on the small scale becomes more difficult .",
    "another way to think about this phenomenon is noting that hydrodynamic motions can easily mix magnetic field lines on the small scale , rather than bent them , in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field ( see a discussion in @xcite ) . as a result",
    "we get elongated eddies , relative to the magnetic field that become even more elongated as we go further into smaller scales .",
    "a model for incompressible anisotropic turbulence is that of @xcite .",
    "this model has been supported by numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "compressible anisotropic mhd turbulence has been studied in @xcite and @xcite .      in",
    "an isotropic turbulent cascade correlations depend only on the separation between points .",
    "contours of equal correlation are circular in that case . if on the other hand the turbulence is anisotropic , two point statistics are also anisotropic . in this case",
    "contours of iso - correlation become elongated , with symmetry axis given by the magnetic field direction .",
    "the technique presented here is similar to one proposed to study magnetic field direction using synchrotron maps @xcite .",
    "iso - contours of correlation functions can allow us to determine the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we calculate two point correlation for different 2d maps generated with our data .",
    "the correlation function between the two scalar functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be computed from @xmath65 where @xmath9 is the separation between two points or ` lag ' , @xmath7 is the spatial separation , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the standard deviations of @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . here",
    "the average is performed on all the radial components and azimuthal angles .    with the original cubes from simulations ( no artificial modification of the spectral indices ) , we calculated the auto - correlation ( correlation in eq .",

    "all the distances in the figures are in grid units.[fig : corrs],width=317 ]    we can see that anisotropy is present in the contours plotted .",
    "it is evident in the case of the emissivity at the centroids of the lines , as well as in the integrated emissivity . in individual velocity slices",
    ", we found that the majority of the velocity channels show this anisotropy in the expected direction ( elongation of the contours parallel to the mean b field ) , but in some slices we see the elongation of correlation contours tilted from the mean magnetic field direction . for fig .",
    "[ fig : corrs ] we choose a representative slice to illustrate this misleading behaviour .",
    "the main purpose of this subsection was to show an alternative method to obtain the direction of the magnetic field , and also to illustrate that anisotropic cascade is present in our simulations",
    ".    the anisotropy based technique could be a unique tool for magnetic field studies , especially when other techniques , e.g. based on dust alignment fail ( see @xcite for a review on grain alignment ) .",
    "it s important to test the vca , which was developed considering isotropic turbulence , in a more realistic case where the magnetic field determines a preferential direction of the turbulent motions . with",
    "that purpose we constructed ppv cubes choosing the los to be parallel to the mean magnetic field ( along the @xmath77 axis ) and compare the results with the case where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the los ( @xmath28 axis ) . for this exercise",
    "we use a data cubes corrected to kolmogorov spectral indices ( @xmath78 in 3d ) . the power spectrum in velocity channels",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_vz_vx ] .        in the figure we can see that the slopes of the spectrum ( spectral index ) are almost identical whether the observer is looking parallel or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "we performed a least - squares linear fitting and found the differences of the slopes in every case are well within the fitting uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that vca is applicable to anisotropic turbulence studies .",
    "in this paper we have tested the vca technique numerically .",
    "we used compressible mhd simulations , and an ensemble of gaussian fields to emulate spectroscopic observations ( ppv data cubes ) .",
    "we computed the power spectra in velocity channels to test the analytical predictions in lp00 .    to obtain the ppv data we modified the output of the simulations to force power - law indices to obtain density fields with spectral indices of @xmath79 and @xmath78 , and velocity fields with spectral indices of @xmath80 to @xmath81 ) .",
    "the spectral indices derived from our emulated observations are within a @xmath82 error of the analytical predictions .",
    "we confirmed trends predicted in lp00 , like the steepening of the emissivity index as we increase the width of the velocity channels , or that the velocity fluctuations dominate the emissivity for thin velocity channels .",
    "this last result is in agreement with a previous study by @xcite , and is important because warns observers against interpret any structure in ppv as density enhancements or ` clouds ' ( see also discussion in lp00 ) .",
    "we showed that the deviations from power - law behaviour at the largest spatial scales ( small @xmath62 numbers ) are due to lack of good statistics at those scales .",
    "this was comparing the results obtained with ppv produced with a constant density and the modified velocity field of spectral index @xmath78 , to those using an ensemble of @xmath83 gaussian cubes with the same index .",
    "an important source of error addressed is a flattening of the power spectrum at large wave - numbers .",
    "this is due to the limited number of emitters along the los .",
    "we illustrated this point comparing the results obtained with the ensemble of @xmath83 cubes with @xmath84 emitters along the los , and an ensemble ( two - deimensional ) with @xmath85 emitters .",
    "we also try including an intrinsic width to the emitters along the los to smooth the sharp edges arising from the limited number of emitters .",
    "this procedure reduced the flattening of the spectrum at large @xmath62 numbers .",
    "but , also increases the effective width of the channels , reducing our ability to make use of the scales on wich we reduced such flattening of the power spectrum .",
    "this problem was found to be the most restrictive to our work . however , is exclusive of numerical simulations , and is not expected to be important in real observations ( like those presented in @xcite ) , where the number of emitting elements is essentially infinite .",
    "we introduced linear shear to our data , and showed that its effect only becomes important when the magnitude of the shear is comparable to the local turbulent shear .",
    "we showed , that the effect of large scale shear is marginal at small scales . and that avoiding the largest scales to computed the power - spectrum allowed to recover the turbulence statistics .",
    "this shows that for ordinary observational situations we can safely neglect shear in the vca .",
    "we analysed the cross - correlation for 2d maps of integrated intensity and emissivity at the centroids of the lines , and showed that they are anisotropic ( elongated ) , with symmetry axis defined in the direction of the mean magnetic field .",
    "this constitutes a new technique to study the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we hope that the anisotropies will reveal the magnetic field within dark clouds , where grain alignment and therefore polarimetry fails . from the point of view of vca",
