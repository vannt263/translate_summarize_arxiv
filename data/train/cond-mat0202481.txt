    "the possibility of observing vortices with quantized circulation @xcite has aroused a big interest . due to the diluteness of the atomic condensates , accurate theoretical predictions are possible .",
    "in addition , in these systems , the diameter of the vortex core is typically three orders of magnitude larger than for superfluid helium , allowing for a more straightforward optical observation .",
    "numerous theoretical schemes have been suggested for the generation of vortices in bec , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "so far only two techniques have successfully generated vortices in condensates , namely the stirring of a condensate with a blue detuned laser  @xcite , and the phase imprinting method achieved via the coherent interconversion between the two components of a binary condensate  @xcite .",

    "einstein condensates has recently also been a subject of active investigation @xcite .    in the majority of current bec experiments ,",
    "the condensate is created in a cylindrical trap , either pancake  shaped , or cigar  shaped . however , in the recent years the possibility of creating a bec in toroidal traps has aroused a growing interest .",
    "toroidal traps have already been used in early sodium bec experiments at mit @xcite , and in recent experiments on vortices at jila @xcite .",
    "also , very recently the idea of creating a toroidal optical dipole trap using laguerre - gaussian beams has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the physics of condensates in toroidal traps have been extensively investigated during the last recent years , including the ground state properties and elementary excitations @xcite , the possibility to obtain vortices which due to the toroidal topology could be metastable beyond some critical nonlinearity @xcite , the generation and properties of solitons and the so called `` svortices '' in this kind of traps @xcite , and even the possibility to obtain a mode  locked atom laser with toroidal geometry @xcite .",
    "very recently , we have proposed that a time  averaged potential produced by the shaking of an usual gaussian trap also leads to the formation of a double well or a toroidal condensate @xcite . additionally , if during the condensate shaking a proper phase is imprinted , dark solitons and eventually vortices can be created in a controllable way within the torus . in ref .",

    "at sufficiently low temperatures , the dynamics of a condensate in an external potential @xmath0 can be well described by the so  called gross  pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the coupling constant , @xmath3 refers to the atomic mass , @xmath4 is the corresponding @xmath5wave scattering length , and @xmath6 is the number of condensed atoms .",
    "we shall consider in the present paper trapping potentials in which the condensate is strongly confined along one direction , so that the mean field energy is smaller than the excitation energy of the trap in this direction .",
    "in this situation , the bec can be considered as quasi2d , and we can restrict ourselves to the analysis of the corresponding 2d gpe , with a modified coupling constant @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavefunction in the strongly confined @xmath9-direction . both 2d @xcite and quasi2d @xcite bec has been recently observed in experiments .",
    "the potential @xmath0 in the remaining two dimensions has an annular shape , which we shall consider possessing rigid box boundaries in sec .",
    "[ sec : box ] , or harmonic transversal confinement in sec .",
    "[ sec : harmonic ] .",
    "we restrict ourselves in the following to the situations in which the bec can be considered in the thomas  fermi regime , i.e. the mean  field energy is much larger than the typical energy spacing of the annular trap .",
    "we consider in the following numerical simulations the case of @xmath10 condensed sodium atoms ( @xmath11 nm ) .",
    "we perform the integration of equation ( [ gp ] ) by an alternating direction implicit ( adi ) crank - nicholson scheme @xcite , using cylindrical coordinates , due to the particular symmetry of the trapping potential . in the present paper",
    ", we shall not consider the issue of the experimental creation of the vortices , but rather we shall concentrate on the vortex dynamics once created . in order to numerically create the vortices",
    ", we employ the crank  nicholson procedure in imaginary time , while ensuring at each time step the proper phase pattern necessary to create the vortices @xcite .",
    "this leads to the creation of vortex states , which are free of any other kind of excitation , and , therefore , allow for a clear analysis of the vortex dynamics .",
    "the proper phase pattern imprinted during the imaginary time evolution has to be carefully chosen .",
    "in particular , the boundary effects have to be taken into account in the method , by adding the corresponding phase contribution of the image vortices ( see next section ) . once the vortices are created we perform a real time evolution .",
    "in this section , we investigate the evolution of vortex states in an annular trap with rigid boundaries . in such a trap the condensate density in the bulk is constant and shrinks to zero at the condensate boundaries on a length scale of the order of the healing length @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the condensate density . due to the absence of the potential in the interior of the torus and the homogeneity of the density inside the box ,",
    "the vortex dynamics is completely determined by the toroidal geometry . in our numerical simulations",
    "we have considered a trap with inner rigid boundary at a radius @xmath14 m , and an outer one at @xmath15 m . we shall not consider , neither in this section nor in the next one , dissipation effects .",
    "these effects will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dissipation ] .",
    "we consider first the situation in which a single vortex is placed in a toroidal trapped condensate . due to the boundary effects the vortex will not remain at rest , but on the contrary it will move at a fixed radius around the torus , where the direction and the modulus of the vortex velocity depends on its circulation @xmath16 , and on the radial position at which it is created . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we present the numerical results for the vortex velocity as a function of the radial vortex position .    such dynamics can be well understood by employing the so  called image method @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review this method . in a homogeneous ( untrapped ) condensate the phase of a state containing a @xmath17 times charged vortex is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the polar angle centered at the position of the vortex @xcite .",
    "therefore , the superfluid velocity becomes @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the condensate phase and @xmath22 is the distance from the vortex line . in the following",
    ", we shall only discuss vortices with one quantum of circulation since , in the cases considered , vortices with @xmath23 will decay into @xmath24 vortices . for",
    "trapped condensates in the thomas - fermi regime , the hydrodynamic form of the gross - pitaevskii - equation allows to approximately impose for the superfluid velocity field the boundary condition of ordinary hydrodynamics , namely the vanishing of the normal component of the superfluid velocity field at the condensate boundary @xcite . this boundary condition and",
    "the specification of the positions and circulations of the vortices , leads to the determination of the superfluid velocity field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vortex dynamics in the homogeneous , and also in the boxlike trapped quantum gas , reproduces the classical vortex dynamics , which is governed by the kelvin theorem , i.e. a vortex moves with the same velocity than the superfluid at its position @xcite . this velocity can be calculated by employing a well  known method in classical hydrodynamics , namely the replacement of the boundaries by additional fictitious vortices , so called image vortices .",
    "these vortices must be placed at the appropriate positions with the appropriate circulations , such that the resulting velocity field obeys the boundary conditions for the considered geometry .    for the toroidal geometry in question",
    ", we have to take into account two ( in principle infinite ) families of image vortices .",
    "for the first family , an image vortex is placed at @xmath25 with circulation @xmath26 and one image vortex with circulation @xmath16 at the origin @xcite , where @xmath27 denotes the position vector of the real vortex in a frame centered at the origin of the torus @xcite .",
    "the image vortex at @xmath28 induces a velocity component normal on the outer circle , so in addition we need an image vortex at @xmath29 with circulation @xmath16 . in turn this image will induce some normal component on the inner circle , so two more image vortices are required : one at @xmath30 with circulation @xmath26 the other one at the origin with circulation @xmath31 and so on and so forth . for the second family",
    ", one considers an image vortex at @xmath32 with circulation @xmath26 .",
    "this image vortex gives a normal component of the velocity on the inner circle so we need in addition one image vortex at @xmath33 with circulation @xmath16 as well as one image vortex at the origin with circulation @xmath34 .",
    "for this we require another image vortex at @xmath35 with circulation @xmath26 and so on .",
    "the total superfluid velocity is made up by the contributions of all vortices ( both real and image ) : @xmath36 in absence of friction , the superfluid velocity at the vortex position equals the velocity of the vortex line .",
    "therefore we get for the vortex velocity : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the same term as the precedent one , but with @xmath39 and @xmath40 interchanged .",
    "this velocity field is in good agreement with that calculated from our numerical simulations .",
    "[ fig:1 ]      we can at this point analyze the vortex ",
    "vortex interaction within an annular trap with rigid boundaries . in a homogeneous condensate",
    "the vortex ",
    "vortex interaction depends on their relative circulation . in absence of dissipation , vortices with the same circulation orbit at a fixed distance from the central point between them . on the other hand , vortices with opposite circulation move parallel to each other forming a so  called vortex pair , which moves as a whole with a velocity which depends on the separation between the vortices .",
    "two vortices in a toroidal box exhibit a completely different behavior .",
    "we shall consider in the following several possible scenarios .",
    "vortices with the same circulation created at different radii but at the same polar angle show a dynamics very similar to that of the homogeneous case : they perform deformed orbits around each other but with an overall drift around the torus ( see .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "vortices with opposite circulation created on the same radial coordinate , but at opposite positions in the torus show an interesting evolution , as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the vortices move towards each other keeping the radial coordinate constant .",
    "when approaching , they move radially , and separate on a new constant radius , i.e. effectively they repel each other .",
    "when they meet at the other side of the torus , they repel each other again , and return to the original radial coordinate , i.e. the overall trajectory for each vortex is closed . if the vortex  anti vortex ",
    "pair is created such that the vortices are close to each other at the same polar angle , one vortex moves very quickly ( during a few ms ) towards the condensate boundary , where it is destroyed .",
    "the other one moves slightly , changes its initial radial position , and later on moves on a fixed radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "this effect explains the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a dark  soliton created in a toroidal geometry seemed to decay into just one vortex , apparently violating the conservation of the angular momentum .",
    "soliton actually decays into two vortices , but one of them is rapidly destroyed at the condensate boundary , while the remaining one is set into an orbit around the annulus .",

    "deviations from the numerical solutions of the gpe are basically due to deformations of the vortex core ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] ) , since the image method does not take into account the internal structure of the vortex core .      in this section ,",
    "we obtain the analytical expression of the vortex velocities explicitely , by employing a method which combines the previously presented image method and conformal mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "we introduce a complex velocity potential @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 is the velocity @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 has to be analytic everywhere except for singularities , and therefore @xmath47 and @xmath48 are both solutions to the laplace equation .",

    "a conformal mapping maps continuous curves ( in particular the boundaries ) into continuous curves , and the solutions of the laplace equation into solutions of the laplace equation , i.e. if the boundary value problem in the original plane is fulfilled , then it is also fulfilled in the new plane with the new boundaries beeing the mappings of the original ones .",
    "the transformation behaviour under the conformal mapping : @xmath72 relates the kirchhoff - routh function of the old and new coordinates  @xcite .",

[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "since the gpe describes a hamiltonian evolution and it does not include any dissipation , the trajectories of the vortices according to the gpe are curves of constant energy .",
    "however , if the vortices approach each other ( or the boundaries ) to a distance comparable to the healing lenghth , the vortex cores deform and the trajectories we obtain numerically slightly differ from these energy lines . the total energy increases with increasing distance between the vortices , or between a vortex and the torus boundaries , because the kinetic energy grows rapidly in this case .",
    "therefore , we expect that in presence of dissipation , the vortices will tend to move towards the trap walls @xcite .",
    "in addition , the vortices will tend to reduce the distance between each other , and therefore , if the vortices do not collide with the walls , the apparent repulsion introduced by the toroidal geometry will be eventually overcome , and the vortices will eventually collide , and mutually annihilate , as in homogeneous condensates .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the vortex dynamics and vortex  vortex interaction in an annular trapping geometry .",
    "the vortex trajectories in the presence of rigid boundaries have been obtained numerically by direct numerical computation of the corresponding 2d gpe .",
    "we have shown that these trajectories can be well described by closed analytical formulas , obtained from the combination of the image method and conformal mapping .",
    "additionally , we have considered the case of harmonic transversal confinement , and showed that the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical ones , once included the effects of the inhomogeneous trapping potential calculated from the corresponding matched asymptotic expansion .",
    "we should note at this point , that the image method is applicable , when the vortices are spatially separated by a distance greater than their core size , which is of the order of the healing length .",
    "the latter statement also concerns the distance between the vortices and the boundaries . if this is the case , no deformation of the vortex core is produced .",
    "however , if the vortices approach to distances comparable to the core size , the initially cylindrical symmetric vortex cores experience evident deformations and therefore , the results provided by the image method begin to depart from the numerically obtained ones .",
    "similarly , the dynamics of vortices in the quantum gas begin to differ significantly from the classical theory @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the vortex dynamics has been limited to the case of 2d traps .",
    "lower dimensional condensates are currently actively investigated , and very recently the experimental observation of 2d ( and even 1d ) condensates have been reported @xcite . however , the results of the present paper and ref .",
    "@xcite , open interesting questions concerning the behavior of vortices in 3d toroidal condensates .",
    "preliminar results concerning vortex lines parallel to the torus axis , confirm that in a 3d torus an essentially similar picture as that discussed for 2d is obtained .",
    "however tiltings with respect to the torus axis , together with boundary effects , could lead to a significant bending of the vortex lines .",
    "this effect will affect the observability of the vortices , since the density minimum will depart from the direction of experimental observation .",
    "in addition , the bending will significantly distort the vortex dynamics , introducing an additional radial velocity to the vortex line . the vortex ",
    "vortex interaction is also expected to be significantly affected in the presence of a significant bending .",
    "the analysis of these effects , as well as those related with the propagation and interaction of vortex rings in toroidal geometries will be the subject of further investigation .",
