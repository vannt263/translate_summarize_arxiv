    "all samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction and high resolution neutron diffraction patterns were also recorded for the stoechiometric samples on the spectrometer 3t2 at the laboratoire lon brillouin ( llb ) , yielding a crystal structure in agreement with previous results .",
    "slight colour changes between the samples with @xmath7=-0.01 ( beige ) , 0 ( white ) , + 0.01 ( light brown ) are attributed to small variations in the concentration of ti@xmath9 and oxygen ions induced by the off - stoechiometry .",
    "powder neutron diffraction patterns were recorded on the diffractometer d1b at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) with a neutron wavelength @xmath26 = 2.52  , down to 0.07k .",

    "there are respectively attributed to an imperfect data correction and to a minority phase with @xmath0=0 propagation vector similar to that of tb@xmath2sn@xmath2o@xmath3 , and not considered in the analysis given below .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by fitting the neutron patterns to the above structures , we determined the ordered magnetic moment amplitude and the correlation length relative to the mesoscopic magnetic order for all samples ( table 2 ) .",
    "these two quantities are the only free parameters of the magnetic patterns , and they can be determined separately .",
    "the amplitude of the ordered moment determines the peak intensities relative to the nuclear bragg peaks , whereas the domain size controls the peak width . in all samples ,",
    "the fitted correlation length of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) correlations is around 22(2 )  , close to the size of the cubic magnetic cell ( 20.3  ) .",

    "the ordered moments remain well below the local tb moment of 5 @xmath8  estimated from the crystal field scheme @xcite at low temperature .",

    "our analysis provides a phenomenological quantitative description of these correlations , which involve only a fraction of the tb moment , amounting to 0.1 to 2 @xmath8  depending on the length scale , namely well below the local tb moment of 5 @xmath8 .",
    "these correlations have been separated by subtracting a pattern above the transition .",
    "these findings should now be confronted to recent studies in single crystals @xcite . in single crystals ,",
    "the temperature variation of the diffuse scattering shows a gradual evolution from a fluctuating spin liquid state characterized by isotropic first neighbor correlations at high temperatures , to a precursor regime ( between t@xmath53 and 4k typically ) where the diffuse scattering starts to be structured and the elastic component increases steadily , then to a regime ( t@xmath46 t@xmath53 ) where the elastic signal is dominant , well structured and t - independent .",
    "this temperature evolution is shown on the subtracted maps of fig .",
    "[ figmapsubtracted ] .",
    "we speculate that a similar evolution with temperature occurs in powders , so that the mesoscopic correlations can emerge .",
    "the precursor regime is not obviously seen here on the powder data due to the low signal background ratio , but it was actually seen in tb@xmath2sn@xmath2o@xmath3  powder @xcite , where the mesoscopic order occurs on a much larger length scale and involves a much higher fraction of the tb moment .    it has been previously argued @xcite that there are actually two transitions below 500mk , the magnetic transition at t@xmath53 occurring about 0.15 k below the @xmath21 anomaly .",
    "this suggests two successive phenomena with decreasing temperature , related to quadrupolar and magnetic order respectively . in",
    "the `` ordered '' samples above x@xmath54 , the onset of quadrupolar order seen by @xmath21 peak occurs at a higher temperature than the long range magnetic order , as frequently observed in rare earth intermetallics @xcite . in the `` spin liquid '' samples below x@xmath54 which show no anomaly of @xmath21 , the magnetic order would remain limited to short length scales .",

    "these features result in diffuse maxima around ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) positions and equivalent ( see fig . [ figmap]a ) .",
    "moreover , the signal sharpens about certain wave vectors , defining pinch points in reciprocal space . in pyrochlores",
    ", these pinch points typically result from the propagation of a local constraint governing the mutual orientations of the magnetic moments @xcite such as the `` two in / two out '' rule in spin ices .",
    "the emergent gauge structure characterizes a coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "et al _ have proposed that a similar ice rule should hold for tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , spin components along the local @xmath15111@xmath16 axes being controlled by a `` two in / two out '' condition , and in the transverse direction by a `` 2-up/2-down '' condition @xcite .    to compare our phenomenological description with these features , we have calculated diffuse scattering maps assuming cubic magnetic domains of size 2@xmath23 and the spin orientations determined above , for different domain orientations ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "we compare these maps to those measured in the ( hh0 , 00l ) plane by elastic neutron scattering @xcite at 0.06(1)k shown in figure [ figmap]a .",
    "first , we notice that the butterfly features around ( 002 ) or ( 220 ) as well as the pinch points which appear between the diffuse maxima in the experimental map of fig [ figmap]a are not reproduced by these calculations .",
    "next , for the spin - ice - like structure , a few calculated maps , such as the map of figure [ figmap]b or the maps k1s2 and k1s3 in the appendix , reproduce rather well the shape , extension and relative orientations of the diffuse maxima at ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) and related positions . for the monopole - like structure ,",
    "the agreement is not as good , whatever the domain orientation ( see an example in figure [ figmap]c ) .",
    "averaging randomly over all domains orientations yields the same map for the two structures , shown in figure [ figmap]d , which is also in worse agreement with experiment .",
    "this suggests that specific spin - ice like textures , involving magnetic domains of correlated orientations are preferred at the base temperature .",
    "they may be generated through nanomagnetic twins , induced by the lowering of symmetry from the @xmath31 sg to the tetragonal or monoclinic sg s discussed above .",
    "such nano twins exist in crystal structures @xcite but their extension to magnetism is beyond the purpose of this study .    to situate this picture in the context of a local constraint , we notice that a local constraint supposes the existence of a manifold of degenerate configurations in the ground state . as temperature decreases ,",
    "the system could select peculiar spin configurations out of this manifold .",
    "the spin - ice - like and monopole - like structures determined above would belong to this manifold .",
    "this selection could be favored by small off - stoichiometry such as minute tb substitution at the ti sites that would slightly perturb the energy scheme by introducing further neighbor interactions @xcite , local changes in the crystal field , random magneto - elastic couplings or local distortions @xcite .",
    "these perturbations could reveal the basic interactions by inducing correlated regions around impurity sites , with the percolation of small long range ordered moment above a certain level of substitution .",
    "similarly , a low fe or co substitution of a pd matrix reveals the high pd band susceptibility by generating giant moments around the fe / co impurity , with the onset of long range ferromagnetic order below one % substitution@xcite .",
    "one could wonder if such energetic selection supports low energy propagative excitations .",
    "this is the case in most fields of physics , where the stabilization of a mesoscopic order with static character allows exotic excitations to emerge .",
    "for instance , the slowing down of thermal relaxations allows dispersive excitations in superparamagnetic particles @xcite , quantum tunneling in molecular magnets @xcite , reversible magnetization in spin glasses @xcite , or more trivially spin waves in classical magnets .",
    "here we would expect excitations to stem from the @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) positions .",
    "propagative excitations have been actually observed in tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3but they stem from the pinch points at @xmath0=(111 ) .",
    "this qualitative difference suggests that these excitations are an intrinsic feature of the coulomb phase .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the mesoscopic order at play in tb@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath6 , which is tuned by small off - stoichiometry .",
    "we find the same type of correlations in all samples , with two possible structures , monopole - like and spin ice - like , describing the powder averaged magnetic order .",
    "magnetic moments of about 2 @xmath8 are correlated over micro domains of 20   size comparable to the cubic magnetic unit cell .",
    "samples in the ordered region of the phase diagram involve in addition a very small long range ordered moment of less that 4% of the local tb moment ( @xmath56 5 @xmath8 ) .",
    "comparison with single crystal maps suggests that in the ground state , the spin - ice like structures are preferred and that they stabilized through twinned magnetic nano domains .",
    "our observations provide evidence that this mesoscopic order coexists in the ground state with a disordered coulomb phase , which involves the major part of the local tb moment .",
    "their links remain however to be elucidated .",

    "we are grateful to the ill for the use of neutron beam time and of the high - flux powder diffractometer d1b operated by the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) .",
    "in order to generate the magnetic domains for a given magnetic structure ( either spin ice like or monopole like ) , we used the following procedure . for simplicity , we start from the cubic unit cell of lattice constant @xmath23 containing 16 tb ions . the monopole and spin ice structure are defined within this cubic cell .",
    "we generate the k and s - domains within the sg fd-3 m . among the 48 symmetry operations of the space group fd-3 m , the first 24",
    "are associated with rotation matrices r with det(r)=1 , and the 24 others deduced from them by an inversion center ( det r=-1 ) do not need to be considered . applying the 24 symmetry operations to the propagation vector @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) splits them in 4 sub groups , which either leave @xmath0 invariant or transform @xmath0 in the @xmath0 vectors ( -@xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath1 , -@xmath1 , @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , -@xmath1 ) of the star \\{@xmath0}. these four subgroups are related to the @xmath0-domains .",
    "for the little group g@xmath34 which leaves @xmath0 invariant , the symmetry operations apply both to atomic positions and atomic moments , using the usual rules : i ) classical spins transform as axial vectors under the symmetry operations ; ii ) for the symmetry operation which generate atomic positions out of the initial crystal cubic unit cell , equivalent atomic positions / magnetic moments in the cubic cell are obtained by appropriate translations @xmath57 , such as @xmath58 = @xmath59 exp ( 2i@xmath60 @xmath0 @xmath57 ) where @xmath59 and @xmath58 are the j moment of the initial cubic unit cell ( l=0 ) and at the distance r@xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this procedure generates for each @xmath0-domain , 6 s - domains , each one corresponding to specific spin orientations of the tb moments within the cubic unit cell . for each domain ,",
    "the structure factor and neutron intensity are calculated in the ( hh0 , 00l ) plane , by taking the fourier transform over a single magnetic cubic cell of size 2@xmath23 , which corresponds to the typical correlation length deduced from the powder data .",

    "performing an average over the intensities of the 24 domains with the same weight for each domain , yields the same intensity distribution for the spin ice and monopole structures ( figure [ figmap]d ) which does not well reproduce the experimental data .",

    "<S> we have studied the spin correlations with @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) propagation vector which appear below 0.4 k in tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3  spin liquid by combining powder neutron diffraction and specific heat on tb@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath6 samples with @xmath7=0 , 0.01 , -0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) order clearly appears on all neutron patterns by subtracting a pattern at 1.2(1)k . </S>",
    "<S> refining the subtracted patterns at 0.07k yields two possible spin structures , with spin - ice - like and monopole - like correlations respectively . </S>",
    "<S> mesoscopic correlations involve tb moments of 1 to 2 @xmath8  ordered on a length scale of about 20  . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , long range order involving a small spin component of 0.1 to 0.2 @xmath8  is detected for the @xmath7= 0 and 0.01 samples showing a peak in the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with previous single crystals data suggests that the ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) order settles in through nanometric spin textures with dominant spin ice character and correlated orientations , analogous to nanomagnetic twins .    </S>",
    "<S> rare earth pyrochlores with geometrical magnetic frustration are model compounds to investigate classical spin ice as well as quantum spin ice physics . </S>",
    "<S> the short range ordered ground states with large degeneracy give rise to a large variety of interesting phenomena such as magnetic monopoles@xcite , first order transition @xcite , or unconventional magnetoelastic excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these frustrated ground states are highly sensitive to small perturbations and to the presence of defects . </S>",
    "<S> already in the 80s , villain @xcite predicted that for an arbitrary small concentration of defects the spinel lattice with pyrochlore structure could switch its ground state from spin liquid to spin glass . </S>",
    "<S> more recently many studies focus on the role of a minute amount of defects in pyrochlores . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure of r@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3  pyrochlores ( where r@xmath9  is a rare earth ion , ti@xmath10 is non magnetic ) accommodates oxygen vacancies , small off - stoechiometries in the r@xmath9or ti@xmath10 lattice , `` stuffing '' or site inversion . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen vacancies introduce ti@xmath9 defects instead of ti@xmath10 ions , modifying the r@xmath9 crystal field and inducing local distortions , with various consequences on the low temperature magnetic properties and spin ice physics . in classical spin ice dy@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , oxygen depletion or a low level </S>",
    "<S> dy stuffing in the ti sites strongly slows down the monopole dynamics at very low temperature @xcite and affects the non - equilibrium macroscopic properties @xcite . in the quantum spin ice yb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> small off - stoechiometry clearly affects the magnetic ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that precise studies of the magnetic defects are needed to resolve controversies concerning these unconventional ground states . among the pyrochlores , tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3  </S>",
    "<S> is one of the most complex , the subject of numerous investigations since the discovery of its spin liquid character in 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> the tb@xmath9 short range correlated moments fluctuate @xcite down to 20mk at the time scale of the muon probe ( 10@xmath11s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these fluctuations has been highly debated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several mechanisms have been proposed taking into account the non - kramers nature of the tb ion and the small energy gap between the ground and first excited crystal field doublets , which open the possibility of quantum spin ice behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of the crystal and magnetic excitations using polarized neutrons show that the magneto - elastic coupling plays a crucial role , yielding an interaction between the first excited crystal field level and an acoustic phonon branch , resulting in a hybrid phonon - magnon mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoelastic coupling also induces original properties in the pyrochlore family , such as giant magnetostriction @xcite and very low thermal conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these features suggest that the tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3 ground state is determined by an interaction between quadrupolar moments , for which a dynamical jahn - teller distortion could be the first ( mean - field ) approximation @xcite .    in tb@xmath2ti@xmath2o@xmath3  </S>",
    "<S> an exotic transition has been observed around 0.4k , as shown initially by anomalies of the specific heat @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below this temperature , spin fluctuations coexist with static spin correlations and spin glass - like irreversibilities @xcite . in single crystals , </S>",
    "<S> these correlations have been detected by an energy analysis of the neutron cross section @xcite , yielding an elastic contribution with diffuse maxima at the positions of half integer bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this intensity vanishes under a small magnetic field of about 0.1 t and shows some sample dependence , suggesting the influence of a minute amount of defects . in powders , a systematic study of tb@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath6 samples @xcite showed that the system could be tuned by minute changes of the tb content around a critical concentration @xmath12=-0.005 from a purely spin liquid state for @xmath7 @xmath13 @xmath12 to a state with partial antiferromagnetic order with @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) propagation vector for @xmath7 @xmath14 @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed nature of this @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) order was not determined in ref . , but it seemed to extend over mesoscopic length scales , rather than the infinite length scale associated with symmetry breaking and bragg scattering .    to investigate this magnetic order , we studied powder samples of tb@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath6 with a precise control of the stoechiometry @xmath7= -0.01 , 0 and 0.01 , by combining neutron diffraction and specific heat measurements . in all samples , by subtracting a pattern at 1.2(1)k , we observe magnetic peaks of lorentzian line shape , which can be indexed with the @xmath0= ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) propagation vector . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks correspond to the mesoscopic order discussed in the following . </S>",
    "<S> its length scale deduced from the lorentzian line shape is around 20  , which corresponds to one magnetic cubic unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the samples ( @xmath7=0 , 0.01 ) showing a transition in the specific heat , we also observe a bragg - like contribution , involving a minute tb moment ordered at a length scale of about 500  , close to the resolution limit . </S>",
    "<S> both bragg - like and lorentzian contributions vanish around 0.4k . by refining the magnetic patterns at the lowest temperature ( 0.07k ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find two possible spin arrangements , fitting the data equally well . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the tb moments remain aligned along their local @xmath15111@xmath16 axes , therefore respect the ising character of the crystal field . </S>",
    "<S> the first arrangement corresponds to magnetic moments in an ordered spin ice configuration @xcite , antiferromagnetically coupled along the @xmath15100@xmath16 cubic axes @xcite without violating the ice rules . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is described by a piling along a @xmath17111@xmath18 $ ] axis of monopole and antimonopole layers @xcite separated by spin ice layers . comparing the calculated single crystal maps to </S>",
    "<S> the experimental one suggests that spin ice - like configurations with non - random mutual orientations , describing a @xmath19nanomagnetic twin texture@xmath19 , are actually favored at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the monopole - like structure could be also stabilized when heating . </S>",
