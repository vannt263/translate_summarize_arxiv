    "our understanding of entanglement has largely grown in the last few years , but the experimental detection is still a daunting challenge .",
    "a recent and thorough review of the subject is provided by the horodecki family @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the tool of choice to detect entanglement is an _ entanglement witness _ ( ew ) @xcite .",
    "it consists of a hermitian operator ( @xmath0 ) with non - negative expectation values for all the separable states , but which can have a negative expectation value for an entangled state , in this case , the state is said to be detected by the ew .",
    "when it comes to experiments , ews are not that good , for each state has its own optimal witness .",
    "the construction of the optimal ew depends on the knowledge of the state ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "there does not exist an ew which detects all the entangled density operators acting on a given hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , an ew can detect many states on a certain region of the state space , though it will be optimal just for a restricted family of states .",

    "we investigate measurements on single copies of unknown mixed quantum states .",
    "the method we propose is simple , and shows to be effective in low dimensions .",
    "we are advocating that using sophisticated mathematical tools to characterize entanglement in a data post - processing fashion , while keeping the experiment as simple as possible , is efficient .",
    "therefore it is an approach in the opposite direction of works like those in @xcite , for example , where entanglement is directly measured in a very elaborate experiment .",
    "we have performed numerical tests in systems of two qubits , one qubit and one qutrit and two qutrits . in the case of two qutrits ,",

    "section iii discusses a possible choice of informationanlly complete set of observables , and illustrates how our method would perform with projective measurements .",
    "in particular , that section makes clear that , compared to two qubits and two qutrits , it is not obvious how to choose the minimal amount of ( or _ optimal _ ) measurements in a @xmath1 system .",
    "section iv offers more questions than answers .",
    "there we analyze the limitations of the method , studying three representative states , namely , one highly entangled and tow very low entangled states .",
    "as presented in this work , our method offers a yes / no answer about the entanglement of a unknown mixed state , but the calculations of section iv suggest that a further development of it could yield a good quantitative estimator of entanglement .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "given a state represented by the density operator @xmath2 , we want to check if it is entangled , without performing a full tomography . as matter of fact",
    ", we want to make the least possible number of assumptions about the state . we will present a strategy based on acquisition of partial information about the state , followed by data ( post-)processing in form of semi - definite programs ( sdp ) .",
    "sdps can be efficiently solved @xcite , and have exact solutions . as the numerical tests will show , it is effective in low dimensions .",
    "we focus on bipartite states in order to simplify the discussion , but the generalization of the formalism to multipartite states is straightforward .    a state @xmath2 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , can be written as : @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are observables forming a complete basis in the hilbert - schmidt space , and @xmath7 .",
    "one possible choice for these observables is @xmath8 , with the @xmath9 being @xmath10 matrices , i.e. , generalizations of the pauli matrices , where @xmath11 stands for the identity matrix , and @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", the state can also be written with explicit _ local _ and _ non - local _ parts , and we have an expression that can be thought of as a _ generalized bloch representation _ , namely , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 identity matrix , @xmath16 are the matrices for @xmath10 , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 , and finally @xmath20 . note that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the local parameters , defining the reduced density matrices , namely : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the partial trace on subsystem @xmath25 , and an analogous expression for @xmath26 .",
    "the _ non - local _ parameters , @xmath27 form a real matrix @xmath28 , and are responsible for the classical and quantum correlations in @xmath2 . note that the parameters in eq . 1 or eq .",
    "2 must be real in order to @xmath2 to be hermitian , but it does not guarantee its positivity .",
    "we will introduce some procedures to check the entanglement of an unknown state , based on partial information about it .",
    "this partial information consists of the knowledge of some of the @xmath29 ( viz .",
    "1 ) , eventually enriched with some further characteristic of the state , as the fact that it is npt , or its marginals are known ( viz .",
    "as it is well known , it is harder to check the entanglement of a bound entangled state than a free entangled one . from the theoretical point of view , it is easy to know if the latter are entangled , for they have negative partial transpose , which is known as the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite .",
    "but if the state is ppt , we need an entanglement witness .",
    "the known examples of bound entangled states show very low entanglement , therefore they will be more difficult to be checked experimentally .",
    "now we present our first procedure , which checks entanglement in npt bipartite states .",
    "the method we propose can be thought of as a way of checking the peres - horodecki criterion .",
    "assuming the knowledge of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) of the parameters @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in eq . 1",
    ", we check the existence of a ppt state compatible with the available information .",
    "the nonexistence of such a state witnesses the entanglement of the state of interest .",
    "this can be done by means of the following very simple sdp :    _ determine @xmath34 @xmath35 _",
    "this sdp is a _ feasibility _ program .",
    "@xmath36 stands for the partial transpose of @xmath34 . when this program is infeasible , i.e. , when there is no ppt state compatible with the available data , we are certain that the unknown @xmath2 is npt and , therefore , entangled .",
    "it could happen that the state of interest has passed through some known decoherence channel , which restricts the state s marginals to some known form .",
    "one example is the werner states @xcite , which correspond to _ depolarized _ states whose marginals are maximally mixed .",
    "the program in eq .",
    "[ sdp1 ] can be easily modified to include this additional information , which corresponds to further constraints in the sdp , namely :    _ determine @xmath34 @xmath37 _    programs in eq .",
    "[ sdp1 ] and in eq .",
    "[ sdp2 ] determine the projection of the state of interest in a certain hyperplane ( in the hilbert - schimidt space ) , and check the existence of the family of ppt states with the same projection . if there is no such state , it means that the measured state is npt , and therefore entangled .",
    "this suffices to check entanglement in spaces @xmath38 ( qubit - qubit ) and @xmath39 ( qubit - qutrit ) @xcite . in larger spaces",
    ", this approach still works for the npt states , but it will not detect entangled ppt states .",
    "now we introduce a procedure that , in principle , can detect both free and bound entangled states .    when the state of interest is in a space which allows for bound entanglement @xcite , we need an entanglement witness to check if it is separable or not .",
    "if we eliminate the constraint of positivity of the partial transpose in the programs of eqs . [ sdp1 ] and [ sdp2 ] , namely , @xmath40 , those programs return a state @xmath34 , which can be ppt or not , compatible with the available data .",
    "we then build an optimal entanglement witness ( @xmath41 ) to @xmath34 , and use it to estimate the entanglement of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "remember that an ew is a hermitian operator with non - negative expectation values on separable states , but which can have a negative expectation value on an entangled state , in this case , we say that the ew detects the entangled state .",
    "the optimal ew of a state yields the most negative expectation value , when compared to any other ew of the same kind , therefore @xmath43 .",
    "note that ews can be chosen to correspond to different entanglement quantifiers @xcite .",
    "the ews in this work have the constraint @xmath44 , and correspond to the random robustness @xcite , which measures how resilient to white noise is the entanglement .",
    "we need an _ error bar _ to our entanglement estimate given by @xmath45 . in order to do that , we rewrite eq . 1 as : @xmath46 the first summation corresponds to the known data .",
    "let s call it @xmath47 . of course ,",
    "the second summation is yielded either by the program in eq .",
    "[ sdp1 ] ) or eq .",
    "[ sdp2 ] , and we call it @xmath49 .",
    "now we can write our entanglement estimate as : @xmath50    the techniques we use to build the optimal ew are based on sdps , and are described in @xcite .    in fig",
    ". 1 , we show how the method performs for two qubits , one qubit and one qutrit , and two qutrits .",
    "each graph is built out of @xmath51 random npt entangled states .",
    "we plot the _ efficacy of entanglement detection _",
    "( i.e. , number of states detected as entangled divided by @xmath51 ) in the sample of states , against the number of measured non - local parameters ( viz .",
    "every time the program in eq . 5 or in eq .",
    "6 is infeasible for a given state ,",
    "it means that the measured data were sufficient to detect entanglement . in the case of two qutrits",
    ", we also test the ew approach of eq .",
    "a state is considered successfully detected as entangled , when both @xmath52 and @xmath53 are negative .",
    "about 70% of the states are detected as entangled , with an effort which is roughly half of a full state tomography .",
    "on one hand , the less entangled is the state , more information we need to infer its entanglement .",
    "therefore , the graphs show 100% efficacy only when all the tomographic parameters are measured . on the other hand ,",
    "highly entangled states are detected with the knowledge of only a few non - local parameters .",
    "random npt states , using the approaches described in eqs . 5 and 6 , for two qubits , one qubit and one qutrit , and two qutrits .",

    "in the last section , we have described the general idea behind detecting entanglement of unknown states , based on partial information . our main goal was to show that the proposed data post - processing is effective .",
    "now we want to discuss how our technique could be actually implemented with projective measurements . a sensible way to do this is by grouping the observables in the smallest number of maximal commuting classes .",
    "commuting observables share a common set of eigenvectors and , consequently , can be simultaneously measured ( i.e. , can be simultaneously diagonalized ) .",
    "therefore , such a scheme would yield the smallest number of complete projective measurements to be done .",
    "let s fix the basis of observables .",
    "for a hilbert space of dimension @xmath54 , we introduce the _ shift _ and _ clock _ operators , namely : @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an orthonormal basis . for dimension 2 , these operators are the usual pauli matrices .",
