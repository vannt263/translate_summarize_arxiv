    "it is now widely believed that functional networks abound in biological systems @xcite , from molecular level ( e.g. , genetic and metabolic networks ) to the levels of cells , organisms and species .",
    "an eco - system may be viewed as a functional network of species where the ( directed ) links of the network represent the inter - species interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions include not only prey - predator interactions but also competitions between species , for the same resources , as well as possible cooperations .",
    "each species is also a network of individual organisms ; the intra - species interactions can be cooperative or competitive .",
    "the problems of evolutionary ecology have been investigated extensively from the perspective of statistical physics @xcite .    in recent papers @xcite",
    "we have developed a model from the perspective of dynamic networks , by incorporating both inter - species and intra - species interactions , for studying some generic features of the biological evolution of eco - systems . in this paper , following a brief review of this model and its main results , we propose an extension of the model so as to capture speciation in a more realistic manner .",
    "for convenience , most of the earlier theories focussed attention either on `` micro''- evolution on ecological time scales ( e.g. , annual variations in the populations of species , mortality rates , etc . ) or on `` macro''-evolution that is most prominent on geological times scales ( e.g. , the phenomena of speciation or extinction ) .",
    "the ecological models @xcite that describe population dynamics using , for example , lotka - volterra type equations @xcite , usually ignore macro - evolutionary changes in the eco - system . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the macro - evolutionary models @xcite do not explicitly explore the ageing and age - distributions of the populations of various species in the system .",
    "the models of ageing and dynamics of age - distributed populations @xcite , usually , focus on only one single species and do not incorporate the inter - species interactions that are , however , crucially important for their extinctions .",
    "but , in reality , evolution is a continuous process . when monitored at short intervals and over a not - too - long period of time , the ecological processes dominate the visible changes in the eco - system . however ,",
    "if the same system is watched over sufficiently long period of time , the macro - evolutionary changes can not be missed .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a `` unified '' theoretical model that would unfold the natural continuous process while simulated on a computer .",
    "very recently , attempts have been made by several groups to merge population dynamics and `` macro''-evolution within a single mathematical framework @xcite .",
    "these efforts may have been made feasible , at least in part , because of the availability of fast computers . in our models",
    "@xcite we have achieved not only the merger of population dynamics and `` macro''-evolutionary processes but also detailed description of birth , ageing and death of individual organism so that the age - distributions in the populations of different species can also be monitored .",
    "moreover , for the study of population dynamics of the species in the eco - system one needs a model of the food web , a graphic description of prey - predator relations @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a food web is a directed graph where each node is labelled by a species name and each directed link indicates the direction of flow of nutrient ( i.e. , _ from _ a prey _ to _ one of its predators ) .",
    "in contrast to most of the contemporary models published in the physics literature ( ref.@xcite is one of the few exceptions ) , we incorporate the trophic level structures of real food webs through a generic hierarchical model @xcite .",
    "besides , in order to capture ecological and evolutionary processes within the same theoretical framework , we allow the food web to evolve slowly with time @xcite .",
    "we model the eco - system as a dynamic _ network _ each node of which represents a niche that can be occupied by at most one species at a time .",
    "the network considered in our earliest formulation of the `` unified '' model @xcite can be schematically represented by a _ random _ network . in a subsequent paper",
    "@xcite we replaced the random architecture by a generic _ hierarchical _ one , where niches are arranged in different trophic levels , with biologically realistic inter - species interactions .",
    "the hierarchical architecture helps us in capturing a well known fact that in the normal ecosystems the higher is the trophic level the fewer are the number of species .",
    "we assume only one single species at the highest level @xmath0 .",
    "there are @xmath1 levels at the @xmath2-th level where @xmath3 is a positive integer .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath2 is @xmath4 . at any arbitrary instant of time @xmath5",
    "the model consists of @xmath6 _ species _ each of which occupies one of the nodes of the dynamic network .",
    "the total number of species can not exceed @xmath7 , the total number of nodes .",
    "our model allows @xmath6 to fluctuate with time over the range @xmath8 . the population ( i.e. , the total number of organisms ) of a given species , say , @xmath9 , at any arbitrary instant of time @xmath5 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the total number of organisms @xmath11 at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 , @xmath3 ( and , therefore , @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 are time - independent parameters in the model .",
    "the network itself evolves slowly over sufficiently long time scales .",
    "for example , random genetic mutations are captured by implementing random tinkering of some of the intra - node characteristics which will be introduced in the next subsection .",
    "the inter - node interactions change slowly to capture adaptive co - evolution of species thereby altering the graph that represents the network .",
    "even the occupants of the nodes can change with time because , as the eco - system evolves , the populations of some species would drop to zero , indicating their extinction , and the corresponding nodes would be slowly re - occupied by new species through the process of speciation .",
    "the faster dynamics within each node captures `` micro''-evolution , i.e. , the birth , growth ( ageing ) and natural death of the individual organisms . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the reproductions to be _",
    "an arbitrary species @xmath9 is _ collectively _ characterized by @xcite : + ( i ) the _ minimum reproduction age _ @xmath16 , + ( ii ) the _ birth rate _ @xmath17 , + ( iii ) the _ maximum possible age _ @xmath18 that depends only on the traophic level occupied by the species .",
    "+ an individual of the species @xmath9 can reproduce only after attaining the age @xmath16 . whenever an organism of this species gives birth to offsprings , @xmath17 of these",
    "are born simultaneously .",
    "none of the individuals of this species can live longer than @xmath19 , even if an individual manages to escape its predators .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath20 assumed above is intended to mimic the fact that the species at the higher trophic level usually have higher lifespan .    during each time step , because of random genetic mutations , @xmath21 and @xmath22 independently increase or decrease by unity , with equal probability , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath21 is not allowed to exceed a predetermined ( large ) positive integer while @xmath22 is restricted to remain positive .",
    "the _ intra_-species competitions among the organisms of the same species for limited availability of resources , other than food , imposes an upper limit @xmath15 of the allowed population of each species . in order to capture this requirement",
    ", we assume the _ time - dependent _ probability @xmath24 ( of individual @xmath25 in species @xmath9 ) of giving birth per unit time to be a product of two factors ; one of the factors is a standard verhulst factor @xmath26 whereas the other factor takes into account the age - dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "for an organisms , this second factor becomes non - zero only when it attains the corresponding minimum reproductive age @xmath21 ; this non - zero factor is assumed to be of the form @xmath27 .",
    "note that the latter factor is unity at @xmath28 , and thereafter decreases , linearly with age , to zero at @xmath20 .",
    "thus in the limit of vanishingly small population , i.e. , @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 if @xmath31 and , thereafter , @xmath32 decreases linearly @xcite as the organism grows older . however , @xmath33 as @xmath34 , irrespective of the age of the individual organism @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "occasionally , random mutations mentioned above can lead to anomalous situations where some organisms may have @xmath35 ; for such organisms @xmath36 for all @xmath5 and these fail to reproduce during their entire life time .",
    "similarly , we assume the probability @xmath37 of `` natural '' death ( due to ageing ) to be a constant @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is a small fraction , so long as @xmath40 . however , for @xmath41 , the probability of natural death increases exponentially ( following gompertz law ) as @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "note that , for a given @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the larger is the @xmath22 the higher is the @xmath37 for any age @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , in order maximize reproductive success , each species has a tendency to increase @xmath22 for giving birth to larger number of offsprings whereas the higher mortality for higher @xmath22 opposes this tendency @xcite .",
    "because of the natural death mentioned above and , more importantly , prey - predator interactions ( to be described in the next subsection ) , the populations of some species may fall to zero . the nodes left empty by such extinct species",
    "are then re - filled by new species . in order to capture this process of _ speciation _ , all the empty nodes in a trophic level of the network are re - filled by random mutants of _ one common ancestor _ which is picked up randomly from among the non - extinct species at the same trophic level .",
    "the subsequent accumulation of random mutations over sufficiently long time leads to the divergence of the genomes of the parent and daughter species that is an essential feature of speciation .",
    "however , occasionally , all the niches at a level may lie vacant . under such circumstances ,",
    "all these vacant nodes are to be filled by a mutant of the non - extinct species occupying the closest _ lower _ level . in our computer simulations , the search for this non - extinct species is carried out in steps , if even the lower level is also completely empty , the search for survivor shifts to the next lower level and the process continues till the lowest level is reached .",
    "if all the nodes , starting from the lowest , upto a certain level ever fall vacant , then , no new speciation takes place and the starvation deaths of the species propagate up the layers ending , finally , with the collapse of the entire eco - system .      the interaction between any two species",
    "@xmath44 that occupy two adjacent trophic levels is given by @xmath45 .",
    "the sign of @xmath45 gives the direction of trophic flow , i.e. it is @xmath46 if @xmath9 eats @xmath47 and it is @xmath48 if @xmath47 eats @xmath9 . in the absence of any prey - predator interaction between the species @xmath9 and @xmath47 , @xmath49 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the absolute value ( magnitudes ) of all the non - vanishing interactions to be unity .",
    "note that although there is no direct interaction between species at the same trophic level in our model , they can compete , albeit indirectly , with each other for the same food resources available in the form of prey at the next lower trophic level .",
    "the @xmath50 account not only for the _ inter_-species interactions but also _ intra_-species competitions for food .",
    "let @xmath51 be the number of all prey individuals for species @xmath9 on the lower trophic level , and @xmath52 be @xmath3 times the number of all predator individuals on the higher trophic level . because of the larger body size of the predators @xcite , we assume that a predator eats @xmath3 prey per time interval .",
    "then , @xmath51 gives the available food for species @xmath9 , and @xmath52 is the contribution of species @xmath9 to the available food for all predators on the next higher level .",
    "if the available food @xmath51 is less than the requirement , then some organisms of the species @xmath9 will die of _ starvation _ , even if none of them is killed by any predator .",
    "if @xmath53 is larger than @xmath52 then food shortage will be the dominant cause of premature death of a fraction of the existing population of the species @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath54 , then a fraction of the existing population will be wiped out primarily by the predators .",
    "it is well known that each species tries to minimize predators but , at the same time , looks for new food resources . in order to capture this , at each time step , each of the species in our model , with the probability @xmath23 , re - adjusts a link @xmath50 from one of its predators and another to one of its potential preys @xcite .",
    "if the link @xmath55 to the species @xmath9 from a _ higher _ level species is non - zero , it is reassigned a new value @xmath56 . on the other hand , if the link @xmath45 to a species @xmath9 from a _ lower _ level species @xmath47 was zero , the new values assigned are @xmath57 .",
    "the requirements of computational resources increase exponentially with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , in almost all our simulations we chose @xmath58 , although we verified that the qualitative features of the data were similar in case of smaller @xmath13 . in our simulations , we always began with a random initial condition where @xmath59 for all species .",
    "since larger species occupy the higher tropic levels and are expected to live longer than those at lower levels , we assinged @xmath60 to the species at level @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "initially , @xmath21 was assigned randomly between @xmath62 and @xmath20 , the population randomly between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the ages of the individuals in the initial state varied randomly between @xmath62 and the @xmath20 of the corresponding species .",
    "the state of the system is updated in discrete time steps as follows :    _ step i- birth _ : each individual organism @xmath25 ( @xmath64 ) of the species @xmath9 ( @xmath65 ) is allowed to give birth to @xmath66 offsprings at every time step @xmath5 with probability ( per unit time ) @xmath67 the explicit form of which has been mentioned above .",
    "_ step ii- natural death _ : at any arbitrary time step @xmath5 the probability ( per unit time ) of `` natural '' death ( due to ageing ) of an individual organism @xmath25 of species @xmath9 is @xmath68 .    _",
    "step iii- mutation _",
    ": with probability @xmath23 per unit time , mutations of intra - node characteristics and the interactions @xmath50 are implemented",
    ".    _ step iv- starvation death and killing by prey _ :    at every time step @xmath5 , in addition to the natural death due to ageing , a further reduction of the population by @xmath69 is implemented where @xmath70 is the population of the species @xmath9 that survives after the natural death step above .",
    "@xmath71 is a constant of proportionality .",
    "if implementation of these steps makes @xmath72 , species @xmath9 becomes extinct .",
    "_ step v- speciation _ : the nodes left empty by extinction are re - filled by new species , with probability @xmath73 following the algorithm for speciation mentioned above .    the longest runs in our computer simulations were continued upto @xmath74 time steps .",
    "if each time step in our model is assumed to correspond to a real time of the order of one year , then the total time for which we have monitored our model eco - system , is comparable to real geological times scales .",
    "the average distributions of the lifetimes of the species are plotted in fig.[fig-1 ] .",
    "it is not possible to fit a straight line through the data over the entire range of lifetimes although only a limited regime is consistent with a power - law with the effective exponent @xmath75 , which has been predicted by several models of `` macro''-evolution @xcite .",
    "the overlap of the curves for different simulation times establishes that our simulations have reached the asymptotic regime where effects of initial conditions have been completely washed out . because of the various known limitations of the available fossil data , it is questionable whether real extinctions follow power laws and , if so , over how many orders of magnitude .",
    "we define the mortality rate by the relation @xmath76 .",
    "the mortality rate extracted from the raw data is plotted against age in fig.[fig-2 ] .",
    "the shape of this curve is consistent with the usual census data that show a minimum in childhood and exponential increase in adults .    during the early stages of the macro - evolution , the distributions of @xmath22 broadens .",
    "but , with further passage of time it shrinks and reaches a stationary form where the largest @xmath22 is around @xmath77 ( for the parameter set used in our simulations ) .",
    "this is consistent with the view that organisms have a choice of either faster reproduction and shorter life or slower reproduction and longer life span .",
    "one crucial effect of the generalization of the rule for speciation proposed in this paper is that the eco - systems are now much more stabilized than in our earlier papers @xcite . in our earlier work , reported in ref.@xcite we allowed an empty node to be re - occupied by one of the non - extinct species from only the same level where the extinct node was located . if , by chance , all the nodes of one level fell vacant at some stage , no speciation could take place ; this would trigger an avalanche of extinctions that would propagate upward in the food chain because of starvation of the organisms and eventually lead to a collapse of the entire eco - system .",
    "in contrast , in the current version of our model , speciation is allowed to take place from lower levels if all the nodes in an entire level become vacant .",
    "this reduces the possibility of collapse of the eco - system but does not rule it out completely .",
    "work on further stabilization of the eco - system with variable @xmath78 is in progress and will be reported elsewhere in a future publication @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have extended our dynamic network model for unified description of micro- and macro - evolution .",
    "a majority of the main characteristics of the model are emergent properties of the self - organizing dynamics of the system .",
    "the main effect of the extension of the speciation dynamics proposed in this paper is that even after large avalanches of extinctions the eco - system can recover by speciation and bio - diversification starting from the surviving species at the low trophic levels .",
    "consequently , the complete collapse of the eco - system becomes extremely rare and the distribution of the litter size @xmath22 became stationary much faster .",
