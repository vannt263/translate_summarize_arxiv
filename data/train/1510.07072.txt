    "<S> _ + _ sendai , 980 - 8578 japan _    the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics has been successfully completed by the discovery of the higgs particle , whereas no definite clue to physics beyond the sm has been found yet . </S>",
    "<S> in such an era , necessity for precise understanding of the sm is increasing more than ever . in particular , to meet demands for accurate measurements required in the lhc experiments as well as those for high - precision flavor physics , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , there has been remarkable progress in the predictability of perturbative qcd in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-quarks are among the important fundamental parameters of perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> they play crucial roles , for instance , in testing predictions of the sm for the yukawa coupling constants of the higgs particle , and also as the input parameters for predicting various observables in flavor physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-quarks have been determined in many ways . even referring only to works published after the latest version of review of particle physics @xcite by particle data group ( pdg ) collaboration , there are analyses based on non - relativistic qcd sum rule @xcite , relativistic qcd sum rule @xcite , deep inelastic scattering @xcite , heavy quarkonium spectroscopy @xcite , and lattice computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for earlier studies . ) </S>",
    "<S> their physics ingredients vary substantially , and also they probe different kinematical regions of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , consistency of the determined values provides a non - trivial test of qcd , and of the sm more generally .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we determine the masses of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-quarks from comparisons of the energy levels of the charmonium and bottomonium @xmath1 states with their perturbative predictions . </S>",
    "<S> this is an update of the mass determination performed as part of the analyses in @xcite , which included perturbative expansion up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> we include one more order , namely up to nnnlo . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the four - loop relation to the pole and @xmath0 quark masses has been computed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is the first full analysis using the @xmath0 mass up to nnnlo . </S>",
    "<S> we also include non - zero charm - quark mass effects in the computation of the bottomonium energy levels , up to the highest order of the currently available computations ( up to two loops of internal @xmath13-quark ) @xcite . on the experimental side , accurate data on the @xmath15 and @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> masses are available today , which we include in our analysis , in addition to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 masses used in the nnlo analyses .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present study is to provide another accurate determination of these quark masses , and also there is a different aspect . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quarkonium states are unique among various hadrons , in that properties of individual hadronic states can be predicted purely within perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if we observe consistency with the masses determined by other methods with high accuracy , that can be an evidence that pure perturbative qcd is indeed capable of predicting properties of these individual hadrons with high precision , with only @xmath19 and the quark masses as the input parameters of the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> since the study at the previous order , our understanding based on perturbative qcd has developed considerably . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , developments in computational technology enabled ( finally ) accomplishment of the full nnnlo computation of the quarkonium energy levels , which have been carried out stepwise . </S>",
    "<S> milestone computations include computations of the two - loop @xmath20 potential @xcite , the full nnnlo hamiltonian @xcite , the three - loop static potential @xcite , full formula of the spectrum @xcite , the four - loop relation between the pole and @xmath0 quark masses @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , non - zero quark mass effects in the three - loop pole-@xmath0 mass relation have been computed @xcite .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> deeper understanding on the structure of qcd has been achieved in the meantime . </S>",
    "<S> solid theoretical backgrounds have been formed based on effective field theory ( eft ) frameworks , such as potential - nrqcd @xcite and velocity - nrqcd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accumulation of empirical facts also reinforced our understanding . </S>",
    "<S> there were examinations of various higher - order perturbative predictions and computations by lattice qcd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> new experimental data on heavy quarkonium states , such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and other @xmath23 , @xmath24 states , became available . </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons of these results clarified the status of perturbative qcd predictions in an unequivocal manner @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , relations between renormalons and non - perturbative matrix elements in eft became clearer , which are supported by growing number of evidences . in purely perturbative predictions , infrared ( ir ) contributions </S>",
    "<S> are encoded as ir renormalons , which induces an uncertainty of the order of non - perturbative matrix elements @xcite . by contrast , in an operator product expansion ( ope ) in eft , one should subtract ir renormalons from perturbative evaluations of wilson coefficients and replace the renormalons by non - perturbative matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> ( see , e.g. , discussion on estimates of non - perturbative contributions to the heavy quarkonium energy levels in @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> since the analysis @xcite uses a method similar to ours for determination of the @xmath14-quark mass , we state the differences of our study . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1)we include the exact four - loop pole-@xmath0 mass relation @xcite , which became available only after the study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2)we include non - zero charm mass effects on the bottomonium energy levels up to two loops of the @xmath13-quark @xcite , whereas @xcite includes only up to one loop . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3)ref.@xcite uses the renormalon - subtracted mass at intermediate stage , whereas we compute the energy levels directly in terms of the @xmath0 mass . </S>",
