    "the soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ; see @xcite for a recent observational review ) are enigmatic sources that were discovered through their repeated bursts of hard x - rays / soft @xmath0-rays . with the improvement in imaging afforded by the current generation of x - ray satellites",
    "sgrs were found to emit softer quiescent x - ray emission as well .",
    "they are generally thought to be young ( @xmath8  yr ) neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields , or magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this belief has been motivated by their associations with young supernova remnants ( snrs ; @xcite ) and sites of massive star formation @xcite , the energetics of their bursts @xcite , and the detection of x - ray pulsations with long ( 510  s ) periods and large ( @xmath9 ) spin - down rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the proposed identification of a snr , the plerion g10.0@xmath10.3 , with sgr  1806@xmath120by @xcite played a key role in establishing the connection of sgrs with snrs and thence young stars .",
    "this identification renewed confidence in the association of n49 with the 5  march  1979 event ( sgr  0526@xmath166 ) and motivated snr associations for two of the remaining sgrs , sgr  1900 + 14 @xcite and sgr 1627@xmath141 @xcite .",
    "the association of sgr  1806@xmath120  with g10.0@xmath10.3was strengthened by the discoveries of a non - thermal core in g10.0@xmath10.3  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that changed on month to year time - scales and of a nearby luminous blue variable star ( lbv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was proposed that all of these sources were related , with the lbv as either a current or past binary companion to sgr  1806@xmath120  @xcite and the variable radio source the result of episodic mass loss from sgr  1806@xmath120  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent moderate - precision ipn position @xcite placed sgr  1806@xmath120outside the non - thermal core suggested by @xcite to be the seat of the sgr .",
    "furthermore , the association of sgr  1900 + 14 with snr  g42.8 + 0.6 was questioned @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the entire issue of whether sgrs are associated with snrs is now open to debate ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an independent localization of the quiescent x - ray counterpart of sgr  1806@xmath120 .",
    "snr / sgr associations are useful for establishing independent ages for sgrs ; the non - thermal core to g10.0@xmath10.3  provides key energetics constraints ; and the lbv star hints at a binary origin and evolutionary scenario for sgr  1806@xmath120 . determining whether or not these associations are true is therefore key to assessing the nature of sgr  1806@xmath120 .",
    "we observed sgr  1806@xmath120  with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on two occasions , beginning on 2000  july  24.7  ut and 2000  august  15.7  ut , with durations of 4.9  ks and 31  ks respectively ( see table  [ tab_sum ] ) .",
    "both observations were taken with the aim point on the backside - illuminated acis s-3 detector .",
    "the first observation was taken in the standard full - frame ccd mode with 3.24-s time resolution , while the second observation was acquired in a 1/4-subarray mode that provides increased time resolution of 0.81  s , but with a reduced field - of - view ( 1/4 of the full - frame area ) .",
    "all the data suffer from the effects of photon pile - up : @xmath10% of the data from the first observation and @xmath11% of the data from the second are corrupted .",
    "pile - up occurs when `` two or more photons are detected as a single event '' .",
    "this results in 3 main effects : ( 1 ) the detected event has an energy that is the sum of all of the incident photon energies ; ( 2 ) the count rate is diminished ; and ( 3 ) the grades of the incoming photons will be altered , so that some may be cataloged as `` cosmic rays '' or other undesireable events and will therefore be rejected .",
    "the consequences of these effects on an observation of a bright source , in addition to modification of the spectrum , are that the spatial profile is altered , as the diminishment of the count - rate is worst for the pixels at the center of the psf , and that some regions with especially high rates of incoming photons may appear devoid of all events , as the total amplitude of the detected events exceeds the onboard energy threshold and is rejected ( similar to grade migration ) .",
    "because of pile - up , especially effects ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above , we can not perform spectroscopy with great accuracy and we defer such analysis until tools for correcting pile - up become publicly available . as noted , pile - up will also affect the spatial profile of the source ( it depresses the center of the psf relative to the wings ) and the timing ( two photons arriving together will be counted as one ) but the analysis presented here should not be affected significantly , as we are not interested in the detailed shape of the psf within @xmath12 or in the exact lightcurve  overall , the position and period will be preserved .",
    "we examined the two images and find a single bright source near the expected location of the sgr .",
    "this source is consistent with an unresolved point source ( gaussian @xmath13 ; @xcite ) . in order to determine if this source is indeed the sgr , we searched for the expected 7-s pulsations @xcite .",
    "we first barycentered the data using the axbary software .",
    "the 5-ks observation had too few photons to detect anything , and it was taken with 3.24  s time resolution .",
    "the 31-ks data had sufficient photons and was taken in the 1/4  subarray mode , which gives 0.81  s sampling .",
    "we therefore added a random number @xmath14 to the time - of - arrival values to eliminate any effects of sampling .",
    "we then performed a @xmath15 test @xcite on the 31-ks data , and find a very significant periodicity at @xmath16  s. to refine this measurement , we performed a phase connection of the _ chandra _  data in the manner of @xcite .",
    "we connected four segments of @xmath17-s , each of which had been binned to 1-s resolution ( appropriate for the 0.8-s sampling ) .",
    "we find , referenced to mjd  51772.0 ( tdb ) , a phase of @xmath18  cycles , a period @xmath19  s , and a period derivative @xmath20 at 90% confidence .",
    "the pulsations have a sinusoidal profile and a rms pulsed fraction of @xmath21%  a folded pulse profile is shown in figure  [ fig : pulse ] .",
    "although the count - rate and spectrum from our observations are uncertain due to pile - up , we can roughly estimate the source flux through use of previously published spectra for sgr  1806@xmath120@xcite . with the count - rate from the 31-ks observation (",
    "the least corrupted ) , we see 0.510  kev fluxes of @xmath22 ( absorbed ) and @xmath23 ( unabsorbed ) . these values are entirely compatible with the 210  kev fluxes found by @xcite . the observed count - rates are constant throughout the observations .    given the 0.81-s sampling and the presence of pile - up , it is not surprising that we do not see any significant bursts of the type typically seen during observations of sgrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that it is likely any bursts during this observation were probably not recorded due to pile - up and to on - board / post - processing rejection of anomalous events .      to accurately localize sgr  1806@xmath120 , we measured its position in both _",
    "chandra _  datasets .",
    "the measured positions from the two observations are consistent to @xmath24 , suggesting that the stochastic position errors are minimal .",
    "there may however be systematic errors on the order of @xmath12 due to overall uncertainties in the _ cxo _  aspect solutions .",
    "to correct for such errors we searched the _ chandra _  images for background sources to use as position references .",
    "we found seven weak sources in the 5-ks image .",
    "none had a match in the simbad database , but two sources ( detected at 2.5-@xmath5 confidence ) were coincident with stars . in the 31-ks image we found 11 sources , two of which had matches in the usno - a2.0 catalog : one detected at 4-@xmath5 confidence that was also in the 5-ks image , the other detected at 2.5-@xmath5 confidence .",
    "we summarize the x - ray detected usno stars in table  [ tab : usno ] .",
    "there are @xmath25 in this region , giving chance coincidence rates of @xmath26% between an individual x - ray source and a usno star , supporting our identifications .",
    "we are pursuing photometric and spectroscopic observations of these stars that should allow us to classify them and verify these identifications ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    using the usno stars to derive offsets for the astrometry",
    ", we find corrections of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , consistent between both _",
    "chandra _  images and comparable in magnitude to the expected aspect uncertainties .",
    "we find a corrected position for sgr  1806@xmath120  of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this position has rms uncertainties of @xmath4 in each coordinate ( from centroiding the x - ray sources and intrinsic usno uncertainties of @xmath31 ; @xcite ) , but should be free from systematic uncertainties .",
    "this position agrees very well ( within the 1-@xmath5 error ellipse ) with the position determined from ipn measurements @xcite , and is @xmath32 from the position of the non - thermal nebula from @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : radio ] .",
    "x - rays are scattered by dust grains in the interstellar medium and one expects to see halos of size 0.1100  arcmin towards objects with hydrogen column density of @xmath33 or greater ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "this issue was first discussed by @xcite and the _ einstein observatory _ found the first such halos @xcite .",
    "the most comprehensive work to date has been carried out by predehl and associates using the _ rosat observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the recent interest of scattering halos around sgrs has been motivated by the discovery of such a halo around sgr  1900 + 14 @xcite . as with sgr  1900 + 14 , one expects an x - ray halo around sgr  1806@xmath120  from scattering off dust .",
    "we therefore examined the radial profile of sgr  1806@xmath120   from the 31-ks observation for better signal - to - noise . in figure",
    "[ fig : halo ] , we show the radial profile of sgr  1806@xmath120  from this observation along with the profile from a ` marx ` simulation ( using the spectrum for sgr  1806@xmath120  from @xcite ) scaled to the same normalization for the inner portion ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) ; such simulations should be accurate out to radii of a few arcminutes .",
    "the background was measured from the acis s-3 chip far ( @xmath34 ) from the sgr  1806@xmath120 , and includes both instrumental and unresolved - source contributions .",
    "we corrected the background estimate to @xmath35 with a ` marx ` simulation of the acis s-3 response to account for vignetting etc .",
    "we find the variation in radial response to be small for @xmath35 , and therefore show a constant background in figure  [ fig : halo ] .",
    "one sees very good agreement between the data and the model at small radii , showing that pile - up has not substantially corrupted the radial profile of this observation ( the model did not incorporate pile - up , as ` marx ` does not correctly simulate the back - illuminated ccds ) .",
    "but there is a clear deviation from the model psf at large radii ( @xmath36 ) that we believe to be indicative of a dust halo contributing @xmath37% to the total x - ray flux . to verify this interpretation we examined the radial profile as a function of the phase of the sgr  1806@xmath120",
    "the profile for the portion of the period when sgr  1806@xmath120  is `` on '' has of course more counts at small radii than the profile when sgr  1806@xmath120  is `` off . ''",
    "however , the outer portion ( @xmath38 ) that we identify as the halo is identical between `` on '' and `` off '' , indicating that the pulsations of sgr  1806@xmath120  are smeared out in the halo .",
    "this suggests that the extended emission is not an instrumental property , as scattering wings or something similar would scale with the immediate flux of the source instead of averaging over time as observed here .",
    "we note , though , that while the data do show a slight softening towards higher radii ( as expected from the @xmath39 dependence of the scattering cross - section ; e.g.  @xcite ) , we can not determine in detail how the halo profile changes with energy",
    ". this could be due to the relatively hard spectrum of sgr  1806@xmath120 , so that the cross section does not vary much over the energy range for which there are significant counts ( 26  kev ) .",
    "it could also be an effect of poor statistics , where a longer observation would show an energy dependent halo .",
    "regardless , we must caution the reader as to this interpretation of the extended emission .",
    "the x - ray position of sgr  1806@xmath120  is now without doubt incompatible with the positions of both the non - thermal core of g10.0@xmath10.3  and the lbv star , although those two positions still agree to @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore follow @xcite and @xcite in suggesting that the lbv , not sgr  1806@xmath120 , powers the core of g10.0@xmath10.3 .",
    "as outlined in @xcite the lbv can easily explain the energetics and changing morphology of the non - thermal core .",
    "sgr  1806@xmath120  could still be associated with g10.0@xmath10.3  as a whole , although this is unlikely given the proximities of the core and the lbv to the center of g10.0@xmath10.3 .",
    "however , we still have a remarkable coincidence : within a circle @xmath40 in radius ( @xmath41  pc at 14.5  kpc distance ; @xcite ) , we have an sgr ( sgr  1806@xmath120 ) , an lbv , and a massive star cluster @xcite .",
    "all three of these objects are exceedingly rare . in addition",
    ", there is a snr0.3  is not a snr . ] at the same position .",
    "while it is hard to draw quantitative conclusions from this coincidence since none of the objects involved have well - defined populations and this region of the sky has been studied in great depth , it is still noteworthy .",
    "individual distances to these sources are not known , but it is plausible that they are all 14.5  kpc away @xcite .",
    "we believe that even if sgr  1806@xmath120  is not directly associated with the lbv or g10.0@xmath10.3 , it was likely born in the same cluster , which requires that the progenitor of sgr  1806@xmath120  was quite massive to have had a supernova before the lbv or the stars in the cluster ( as noted by @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps this is a case of an extremely high - mass star ( @xmath42 ) forming a neutron star due to large mass loss over its lifetime @xcite ?",
    "alternatively , the sources could all have originated in the same molecular cloud , but the supernova from sgr  1806@xmath120  could have triggered the star formation that lead to the lbv and the cluster .",
    "the angular scale where the scattering halo departs from the psf is smaller than that seen for _ rosat _ data , and we do not measure the halo out to such large radii , so the relations presented for _ rosat _ data by @xcite are not directly applicable . however , we can correct the relation between fractional halo intensity and hydrogen column density from @xcite to the appropriate energy and angular scale range for our data , and we find an expected halo intensity of @xmath43% based on the @xmath44 , as determined by @xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the measured intensity , supporting the conclusion that we see a halo and not an instrumental artifact , and implying that the size distribution of the scattering grains at small angular scales is similar to that seen for the larger _ rosat _ halos .",
    "the halo we see is very similar ( in angular scale and fractional intensity ) to that seen for sgr  1900 + 14 @xcite , suggesting that they lie behind similar dust columns ( or possibly that both `` halos '' are in fact instrumental effects ) . as with sgr  1900 + 14 ,",
    "the pulsations of sgr  1806@xmath120  are too smeared out in the halo to use them to determine a geometric distance ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if observations were made of sgr  1806@xmath120  soon ( @xmath45 hours to days ) after a significant change in the level of its emission ( e.g.  following a giant flare ) such that the change was visible in the halo , a distance determination could be made .",
    "_ bepposax _ is probably the only current satellite that has the necessary slew capabilities coupled with spatial resolution and soft - energy response to perform these observations .",
    "the measured period of sgr  1806@xmath120  is not consistent with either its long - term spin - down @xcite or the newer spin - down measured from phase - connected _ rxte _ observations @xcite , as seen in figure  [ fig : timing ] . while sgr  1806@xmath120  exhibits substantial timing noise @xcite , the long - term trend was generally stable for a number of years .",
    "however , @xcite found that at a single epoch the instantaneous spin - down rate for sgr  1806@xmath120  was higher by a factor of 1.5 that the global trend , and to account for the new _ chandra _   data , the spin - down rate must have increased even more . between the last _ rxte _ measurement from @xcite and our measurement , the average spin - down rate is @xmath46 , which is a factor of 2 higher than the largest @xmath47 previously measured for this source .",
    "this change is similar to the large change in both spin period and spin - down rate seen for sgr  1900 + 14 following its activation during 1998  august ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and for the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e  1048.1@xmath15937 @xcite .",
    "sgr  1806@xmath120  must have either increased its long - term spin - down substantially or suffered from a momentary large change in spin - down .",
    "such sudden changes in spin - down are capable of being produced within the magnetar framework @xcite , either due to particle outflows or due to re - alignment of the neutron star crust , but they are typically assumed to be episodic and triggered by bursting or flaring activity @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite did observe a period of moderate burst activity for sgr  1806@xmath120  several days before the 31-ks _ chandra _  observation , but this was too close to the _ chandra _  observation to have affected the spin - period significantly . whether sudden or gradual , the change in rotation for sgr  1806@xmath120   had to start before the bursts observed by @xcite ( unless the spin - down is orders of magnitude larger than previously seen ) , so these changes were not caused by burst activity .",
    "this suggests that the more gradual change is the correct mechanism in this case , perhaps due to continuing plastic deformation of the crust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , spin - down can not be used to determine the ages or magnetic fields of any sgr in the manner typical for radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , as noted by @xcite .",
    "we must instead rely upon arguments relating to the super - eddington bursts @xcite , global energetics , and similar phenomena as indicators of the magnetar - like fields of these objects .",
    "we have confirmed the position of @xcite for sgr  1806@xmath120 , and determined that it is near neither the non - thermal core of g10.0@xmath10.3  @xcite nor the luminous blue variable star ( lbv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although those two sources may be associated . through comparison of the radial profile of sgr  1806@xmath120to a model psf , we see evidence for a broad x - ray scattering halo . given its violent nature , sgr  1806@xmath120  may produce changes in its x - ray emission such that observations of this halo could lead to a geometric distance determination , thereby fixing the luminosity scale of sgrs and locating sgr  1806@xmath120  in three dimensions relative to the massive star cluster @xcite , the lbv , and other nearby objects .",
    "timing analysis of the _ chandra _  data show that sgr  1806@xmath120  is not continuing its long - term trend of spin - down that it has followed for the past 4  years .",
    "this is similar to changes in spin - down observed for sgr  1900 + 14 following the 1998  august outbursts , although only minor bursts were observed for sgr  1806@xmath120  around the time of these observations and these bursts are unlikely to have been responsible for the deviation from normal spin - down .",
