    "the linear bath of oscillators plays a prominent role in discussions of dissipation and decoherence @xcite . in the classical limit , the force fluctuations derived from that bath correspond to a gaussian random process .",
    "although this is a generic case ( due to the central limit theorem ) , there are physical situations when non - gaussian random processes are important . in this report",
    ", we examine the simplest possible quantum - mechanical bath whose fluctuations correspond to a classical telegraph noise : a single two - level system subject to a white noise force .",
    "the effects of this nonlinear bath are analyzed by coupling it , in turn , to a spin , whose relaxational dynamics under the action of the bath is calculated .    in the literature ,",
    "another type of physically relevant nonlinear bath is usually discussed : the spin bath@xcite , consisting of some large number of spins which are coupled to the system under consideration .",
    "our model system is simpler in that it contains only a single `` nonlinear element '' , the two - level system .",
    "irreversibility is generated not by having a larger number of spins but by the coupling to the linear bath . although designed as a drastically simplified model system , it may be physically relevant for situations like charged tunneling systems@xcite in the vicinity of a mesoscopic quantum - coherent device ( e.g. a cooper - pair box@xcite ) , which lead to electrostatic potential fluctuations and which are , themselves , also subject to dissipation and decoherence by their environment . viewed as a whole ,",
    "our model consists of two coupled two - level systems , one of which is coupled to a linear bath . of course ,",
    "such systems have been studied before , both in the context of the quantum measurement problem and decoherence of coupled qubit systems . in refs .  ,  ,   and  , the model of two spins ( qubits ) coupled to an environment has been analyzed in detail .",
    "however , we emphasize that our perspective and the questions addressed in this article are different from these approaches , since we are interested primarily in the differences arising from substituting the nonlinear bath ( in the form of the dissipative two - level system ) by a linear bath ( see fig . [ figur1 ] ) . this question is relevant , since , in many physical situations where the precise nature of the bath decohering a given system is unknown , it is simply treated as a linear bath , with some given correlation function .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to understand in more detail the kind and magnitude of possible errors introduced by such an approximation , in cases where the coupling can not be assumed to be very weak .",
    "the basic strategy is to calculate the equilibrium correlator of the two - level system exactly ( which can be done in the limit of infinite temperature ) and to compare the results to three common approximations .",
    "one of those involves replacing the nonlinear bath by a linear bath , whose correlation function is prescribed to be the same as that of the nonlinear bath .",
    "the others are a markoffian master equation and a weak - coupling approximation , applied to the dynamics of the spin under the influence of the bath .",

    "[ model ] , we give the model hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ master ] , the four different approaches are defined by specifying the evolution equation for the density matrix in each case .",

    "<S> we analyze a model of a nonlinear bath consisting of a single two - level system coupled to a linear bath ( a classical noise force in the limit considered here ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the effects of a nonlinear , non - markoffian bath in a particularly simple situation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effects of this bath onto the dynamics of a spin by calculating the decay of the equilibrium correlator of the spin s @xmath0-component . </S>",
    "<S> the exact results are compared with those obtained using three commonly used approximations : a markoffian master equation for the spin dynamics , a weak - coupling approximation , and the substitution of a linear bath for the original nonlinear bath . </S>"
