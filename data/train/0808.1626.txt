    "nevertheless , exact solutions always demand importance for understanding of the inherent non - linear distinguishing peculiarity of gravity . in this article",
    ", we provide a discussion on a special class of exact static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "the static spherically symmetric metric in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath1 can be written as    @xmath2    field equations pertinent to this metric are    @xmath3+\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi \\rho,\\ ] ]    @xmath4-\\frac{1}{r^2}=8\\pi p,\\ ] ]    @xmath5 = 8\\pi p.\\ ] ]    we use prime to represent derivative with respect to the radial coordinate .",
    "the usual conservation equation @xmath6 implies @xmath7    note that in the above set of four equations there are four unknowns , so in principle , there should exist unique exact solution .",
    "they are found to be @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary constants .",
    "two plots are given below representing the dependence of metric components as functions of radial coordinate with @xmath12 and @xmath13 taken as parameters .",
    "pressure and density are also plotted to show the nature of their radial dependence .",
    "vs @xmath14 for different values of @xmath12 . ]",
    "vs @xmath14 for different values of @xmath13 . ]",
    "the pressure and density both diverge at the origin but their ratio remains constant i.e. @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are monotonic decreasing functions of r. one can also see that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 as well as @xmath21 .",
    "thus all energy conditions including dominant energy condition are satisfied .",
    "and @xmath17 vs @xmath14 ]    one of the important features of einstein s equations is the appearance of curvature singularity . in this solution",
    "there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath23 .",
    "but a close look at this spacetime solution shows that the metric does not contain any curvature singularity apart from the well known @xmath24 singularity .",
    "( later we shall show that in suitably chosen isotropic coordinates this singularity does not appear . ) this can easily be seen by calculating the analytical expressions of the curvature invariants which , for the present metric are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 the expressions show that they are regular everywhere and diverge only at @xmath24 .",
    "we also see that the kretschmann scalar @xmath28 becomes zero as @xmath29 .",
    "hence the solution is asymptotically well behaved .",
    "the dependence of the scalars on the radial variable is shown in representative curve below .",
    "we avoid the @xmath30 coordinate singularity by suitably choosing the range of the radial coordiate .     and @xmath31 vs @xmath14 .",
    "]     vs @xmath14 for different values of @xmath13 . ]",
    "the new interior metric is now written in isotropic coordinate as given by    @xmath32 ^ 2 \\left [ d\\sigma^2+\\sigma^2 ( d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)\\right].\\ ] ]    a straighforward comparison with the static spherically symmetric metric ( eq .  ( 1 ) )",

    "hence , finally , the metric takes the form as @xmath38 } + \\frac { \\left [ c + c \\sin ( \\ln                 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_0 } ) \\right]^2}{64\\sigma^2 } \\left [   d\\sigma^2+\\sigma^2 ( d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)\\right]\\ ] ]    note that in isotropic coordinate system , the singularity @xmath39 does not appear .",
    "this supports our earlier assertion that this singularity is a coordinate one which was evident from the calculations of the invariants .",
    "now , we match our interior solution to the exterior schwarzschild solution at a junction interface @xmath40 situated at @xmath41 .",
    "we impose the continuity of @xmath42 across the surface s :    @xmath43 = @xmath44    at @xmath45 [ i.e. on the surface s ] .",
    "the continuity of the metric then gives generally    @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "hence one can find    @xmath48    and @xmath49 these imply , @xmath50 @xmath51    since @xmath52 , so to match our interior solution to the exterior schwarzschild solution at a junction interface @xmath40 situated at @xmath41 , one has to take @xmath53 . equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) confirm this i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "hence , our interior metric takes the form as    @xmath54    we will face a problem to get the boundary surface ( thin shell @xmath55 ) as @xmath56 @xmath57 , but p never vanishes except at infinity .",
    "we see that the metric coefficients continuous at the junction i.e. at @xmath55",
    ". however , the metric need not be differentiable at the junction and the affine connection may be discontinuous there .",
    "this statement may be quantified in terms of second fundamental form of the boundary .",

    "@xmath62 are the intrinsic coordinates on the shell with @xmath63 is the parametric equation of the shell s and @xmath64 and @xmath65 corresponds to interior ( our ) and exterior ( schwarzschild ) .",
    "_ since the shell is infinitesimally thin in the radial direction there is no radial pressure_. using lanczos equations  @xcite , one can find the surface energy term @xmath66 and surface tangential pressures @xmath67 as @xmath68_-^+ , \\ ] ] @xmath69_-^+ .\\ ] ]    the metric functions are continuous on s , then one finds @xmath70 and @xmath71\\ ] ] hence one can match our interior solution with an exterior schwarzschild solution in the presence of a thin shell .",
    "the whole spacetime is given by our metric and schwarzschild metric which are joined smoothly .    here",

    "we are now in position to summarize our findings .    1 .",
    "one can note that at the singularity @xmath82 , @xmath83 does not vanish and this implies that no horizon exists .",
    "also all the curvature invariants are regular everywhere implying that the singularity appearing in ( 7 ) is only a coordinate singularity .",
    "2 .   our results failed to give positive pressure but all the energy conditions are satisfied for the physical acceptability of perfect fluid source . also pressure and",
    "density failed to be regular at the origin but their ration remains constant and active gravitational mass always positive and will vanish as @xmath73 i.e. it does not have to tolerate the problem of singularity .",
    "though our results failed to get boundary surface where interior solution will match with exterior schwarzschild solution , in spite of , we have shown that there exists a thin shell ( boundary surface ) where interior metric and schwarzschild metric are joined smoothly .",
