    "arp 220 ( ic 4553/4 ) , with an infrared luminosity of 1.5 x 10@xmath3  at @xmath4=8 - 1000 @xmath0 m , is one of the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "visual wavelength images reveal two faint tidal tails , indicating a recent tidal interaction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and high resolution ground - based radio and near - infrared imaging show a double nucleus ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the radio nuclei are separated by 0.98  at pa @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the system is also extraordinarily rich in molecular gas ( @xmath6 , scoville , yun & bryant 1997 ) and about 2/3 of this gas and dust is concentrated in a thin disk with radii @xmath7 pc .",
    "ground - based observations at 10 to 30 @xmath0 m suggest that the far - infrared luminosity originates from a region of similar size ( @xcite ) . to power",
    "the energy output seen in the infrared by young stars requires a star formation rate @xmath8  yr@xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , if the luminosity originates from an agn , this source must be sufficiently obscured by dust that even the mid - infrared emission lines are highly extinguished since spectroscopy with iso shows no evidence of very high ionization lines at wavelengths out to 40@xmath0 m ( @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we report near infrared imaging at @xmath4=1 - 2.2@xmath0 m with 0.10.2  resolution obtained using the nicmos camera on the hst .",
    "these high resolution data clearly reveal the complex nature of the nuclei with the morphologies of both near - infrared nuclei strongly affected by dust obscuration and enable an improved registration of the infrared relative to the radio nuclei . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt a distance of 77 mpc ( 1  corresponds to 373 pc ) for arp 220 using h@xmath10=75 mpc@xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "arp 220 was observed using the nicmos camera 2 on the hst on 4 april 1997 as part of the early release observations ( ero ) program .",
    "camera 2 has a 256@xmath11256 hgcdte array with 0.076  pixels , providing a 19.2  field of view .",
    "images were obtained in the f110w , f160w and f222 m filters , providing resolutions of 0.11 , 0.16 and 0.22 respectively . for both the galaxy and an hst guide star , observed to determine the point - spread - function ( psf ) , a four step dither pattern was executed with offsets of 5.4 pixels ( 0.41 ) . at each position in the dither pattern on arp 220 ,",
    "two integrations , each lasting 128 sec , with multiple non - destructive reads ( multiaccum ) were obtained .",
    "the data were dark subtracted , flat fielded and corrected for cosmic rays using the iraf software nicmos - pipeline routines .",
    "the dithered images were shifted and coadded using the drizzle routine in iraf .",
    "the flux scale employed calibration factors of 2.35@xmath11 , 2.77@xmath11 , and 6.11@xmath12  jy ( adu / sec)@xmath9 at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.22 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measured fluxes at h ( 1.6@xmath0 m ) and k ( 2.22@xmath0 m ) for the nuclear sources and for a 5  aperture agree to better than 10% with those obtained from ground - based imaging by carico ( 1990 ) . at 1.1@xmath0 m",
    "a direct comparison is not possible since the standard j filter is at 1.25@xmath0 m .",
    "the rms noise levels in the final images are 12 , 15 , 35 @xmath0jy ( arcsec)@xmath13 at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.22 @xmath0 m , respectively .    for observations with nicmos camera 2 ,",
    "the angular resolutions are a factor of two lower at 2.22@xmath0 m than at 1.1@xmath0 m .",
    "this can seriously hinder attempts to analyze color gradients where there are compact emission sources unless the images at each wavelength are convolved or deconvolved to a common resolution .",
    "we have adopted two approaches : convolving the two short wavelength images to the resolution of the raw image at 2.22@xmath0 m and deconvolving the two long wavelength images to the resolution at 1.1@xmath0 m .",
    "the former is , of course , the safest approach but provides more limited spatial resolution . for the latter approach",
    ", deconvolution was done using the richardson - lucy algorithm without damping ( @xcite ) to achieve 0.14  resolution .    in figure 1 ( color plate ) the images for the entire camera 2 field from the 3 bands are combined in false color .",
    "the image clearly reveals the structure around the twin nuclei separated by @xmath1 1  e - w in addition to extended emission from the system out to @xmath148 .",
    "at least eight unresolved ( @xmath15pc ) sources are also seen at radii 27   the brightest being approximately 5  southwest of the nucleus .",
    "all of them have bluer colors than the nuclei but their magnitudes are sufficiently bright that they can not be individual stars .",
    "we hereafter refer to them as clusters .",
    "the brightest of these clusters ( 1 , 2 , and 4 ) are seen in the visible band hst imaging of shaya ( 1994 ) and they are also clearly seen in subsequent i - band hst imaging ( borne and lucas 1997 ) .    the central region is shown in contour form in figures 2 - 4 ( plates 2 - 4 ) using : the original drizzled images at each wavelength ; images convolved to 0.22@xmath16 resolution ; and deconvolved to 0.11@xmath16 resolution , respectively . in each case , the lower right panel shows the ratio of the 2.22@xmath0m/1.1@xmath0 m data .",
    "coordinate offsets in figures 2 - 4 are measured from the peak of the deconvolved 2.22@xmath0 m emission in the west nucleus .",
    "flux measurements for the nuclear components and all identified cluster sources are listed in table 1 along with measured sizes ( fwhm ) for resolved structures .",
    "most of the near infrared emission from the nuclear region of arp220 must be stellar ( rather than hot dust or shock - excited emission lines ) since the strength of the co overtone absorption at 2.35@xmath0 m requires that @xmath1490% of the observed near - infrared flux in a 5  aperture arises from stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in previous ground - based images ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , the core of arp 220 appears as two nuclei separated e - w by 0.95  . in the hst - nicmos images , the eastern nucleus breaks up into northern ( ne ) and southern ( se ) components separated by 0.4   the latter appears highly reddened and is barely visible in the 1.1@xmath0 m image . and",
    ", the bright nucleus on the west ( w ) , is seen as a _ crescent _ arc in the new images .",
    "thus , for both nuclei , their morphology , even at @xmath4=2.2@xmath0 m ( where the extinction is 10 times less than a@xmath17 ) appears strongly influenced by dust extinction . in addition , a new component is seen @xmath18  south of the western nucleus ( s ) and another midway between the two nuclei .",
    "the accuracy of the guide star position for the arp 220 observations was insufficient to independently determine the absolute positions of the near infrared images .",
    "we have therefore registered the infrared images by comparison with cm - wave radio continuum maps for which the coordinates are well - determined .",
    "graham ( 1990 ) matched the brightest radio sources ( a and b , @xcite ) with the brightest portions of the eastern and western nuclei ( i.e. components ne and w ) .",
    "however , this placement now seems unlikely since the separation and position angles of the two radio components and the two brightest infrared components are significantly different .",
    "instead , we suggest that both of the two brightest radio components are located within the areas of very high extinction  south of the w component and between the ne and se sources .",
    "this registration places the weak radio source c precisely on the southern ( s ) infrared source which is relatively blue and therefore unlikely to be strongly extincted . using the 2.22@xmath0m/1.1@xmath0 m ratio image ( figure 3 ) to estimate the relative extinction across the region ,",
    "we have crudely corrected the 2.22@xmath0 m image for extinction under the assumption that the dust is in the foreground , i.e. not mixed with the stars . in figure 5 ,",
    "the radio source contours from baan & haschick ( 1995 ) are shown superposed on this ` extinction - corrected ' 2.22@xmath0 m image using the registration discussed above .",
    "radio source b lies within the dark area below the crescent on the w source while a is at the north of the reddened se infrared source .",
    "support for our registration of the near infrared emission is provided by the strong morphological similarity of the infrared structure shown here and the h@xmath2co emission ( @xcite )  the latter exhibits similar offsets relative to the radio continuum .",
    "the 2.22@xmath0m/1.1@xmath0 m ratio images in figures 2 - 4 may be used to probe variations in the extinction assuming that the intrinsic color of the underlying stars is not strongly varying .",
    "the false color image for the deconvolved data ( plate 1 ) clearly shows an overall increase in the reddening towards the central regions of arp 220  in the annulus at 2 - 4  radii , m@xmath19=2.30 mag , while inside 2   radius , m@xmath19=3.19 mag . in the central 2  , figure 3 reveals even larger variations : high reddening is seen over the se source where the color ( 1.1 - 2.2@xmath0 m ) is 3.86 mag and in a nearly complete ring surrounding the bright w source where the color is 3.31 mag . for a population of stars with ages @xmath20 yrs",
    ", typical colors are j - h = -0.2 , h - k @xmath10.0 mag . for a standard extinction law ( @xcite ) , and the young population colors , the derived visual extinctions are a@xmath17= 17 ( w ) , 15(s ) , 24(se ) , 18(ne ) , and 13(all ) mag based on the observed h - k magnitudes given in table 1 . for an old population ( j - h @xmath10.74 , h - k @xmath10.24 mag ) , the visual extinctions are 13 , 11 , 20 , 14 , and 9 mag respectively , similar to the 1  resolution estimates obtained by larkin ( 1995 ) from pa@xmath21 and br@xmath22 line ratios .",
    "considerably higher estimates were obtained by sturm ( 1996 ) and it is clear that there are undoubtedly areas in the nucleus from which virtually no radiation escapes , even at 2.2@xmath0 m .",
    "the complex near infrared structure of arp 220 is due to there being multiple centers of star formation activity ( as in arp 299 , cf .",
    "wynn - williams 1991 ) and strongly varying dust obscuration within the merger nuclei .",
    "the relatively simple double - nuclei structure of the radio continuum ( @xcite ) and the mm - wave dust continuum ( @xcite ) suggest that the major mass concentrations are associated with the w and se sources .",
    "the ne and s sources would then be relatively minor mass concentrations , albeit with high present - epoch luminosity .",
    "if the intrinsic , _ unobscured _ shapes of the expected stellar emission are either ellipsoidal ( in the case of the nuclear core clusters ) , point - like ( for unresolved stellar clusters ) or disk - like ( for young stars formed in disk ) , the unobscured morphology should appear spherical or elliptical depending on the viewing angle .",
    "for both the e and w nuclei , the morphology at 1.1 - 2.2@xmath0 m is clearly not elliptical : the western nucleus appears as a crescent and the eastern nucleus is split into two components ( ne and se ) with very different colors .",
    "given our suggested registration of the radio and infrared , it is evident that the true centers of the nuclei are so obscured that neither is seen directly at 2.2@xmath0 m .",
    "the crescent or partial - ring morphology of the western component is clearest in the deconvolved 2.2@xmath0 m image ( figure 4 ) , but it is also apparent in the original 2.2@xmath0 m data ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this morphology might readily arise under two circumstances : if there is an obscuring disk of dust ( and gas ) embedded within the _ spheroidal _ nuclear star cluster or if a central starburst _ ring _ or disk of young stars is partially obscured by its own dust .",
    "figure 6 models the surface brightness distribution for a star cluster in which the midplane is cut by a totally opaque dust disk ; here , the observed crescent - shape arises due to an increase in geometrical path length through the cluster periphery . the second hypothesis with a ring or torus of massive star formation is similar to models proposed for seyfert galaxy nuclei ( eg .",
    "maolino & rieke 1995 , genzel 1995 ) .",
    "two important characteristics of the observed emission should be emphasized : the crescent shape and the extremely abrupt cutoff by dust to the south of the w source .",
    "the former strongly implies that the dust is _ embedded _ in the core cluster / disk rather than being a foreground dust lane ; the latter implies that the dust is in a extremely thin , but very opaque disk .",
    "this geometry agrees with that suggested by scoville , yun & bryant ( 1997 ) based on arcsec resolution imaging of the mm - co line .",
    "the low velocity dispersion of the molecular gas implied a very thin disk ( @xmath23z=16 pc ) .",
    "a similar disk structure in the nuclei has been suggested by baan & haschick ( 1995 ) based on their h@xmath2co data .",
    "the morphology of the eastern nucleus is not so distinctive , yet the apparent bifurcation of the nucleus into lowly and highly reddened components ( ne and se respectively ) and the probable positioning of the radio nucleus in an area of weak 2.2@xmath0 m emission both suggest a nuclear dust disk  like that in the w nucleus . for both nuclei ,",
    "the highest extinctions occur to the south of the radio centers , suggesting that the dust disks are tilted such that the south is the near side .    the measured infrared sizes ( fwhm ) of the w , se and ne source components are 0.2 - 0.5  , corresponding to 75 - 185 pc .",
    "the separation of the radio nuclei ( a and b ) is 0.98  or 364 pc in projection .",
    "their actual separation is @xmath1600 pc if the geometry suggested by baan & haschick ( 1995 ) and scoville , yun & bryant ( 1997 ) is correct since the nuclei would then be well off the major axis of their orbits . within each of the nuclei , scoville , yun & bryant ( 1997 ) detected co emission profiles of full - width @xmath1250 .",
    "if the rotation velocities of gas within each nuclear cluster is @xmath1125  at 75 pc radius , their dynamical masses are @xmath24 .",
    "magnitudes and positions of eight clusters for which reliable measurements could be made are listed in table 1 in order of decreasing flux at 1.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "all of these sources are too bright to be individual stars . given our resolution ( @xmath1 30 pc ) , the fact that they are unresolved is entirely consistent with their being globular clusters .",
    "their measured offsets from the 2.2@xmath0 m centroid imply projected galactic radii of 0.92.7 kpc .",
    "the apparent clustering of these sources around arp 220 , with none seen beyond 7.5  radius , suggests that most of them must be associated with arp 220 rather than in the foreground .",
    "given the fact that we have measured only two colors and must use one color to constrain the reddening , the remaining color does not strongly discriminate the ages of these clusters .",
    "the cluster sources outside 2  radius have measured colors at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2@xmath0 m which are consistent ( within the uncertainties ) with those of globular clusters in ngc 5128 ( @xcite ) , indicating that they could have age @xmath25 yrs and essentially no near - infrared reddening ( a@xmath26 5mag ) .",
    "the absolute k magnitude of the brightest cluster ( m@xmath27= -13.5 mag ) in arp 220 is @xmath11.5 magnitudes brighter than the brightest cluster in ngc 5128 ( @xcite ) and is comparable in brightness to the tip of the globular cluster luminosity function for ellipticals ( @xcite ) .",
    "very young much that massive , globular clusters event in the arp 220 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the nicmos project has been supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 3042 .",
