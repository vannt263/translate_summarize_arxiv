    "reference @xcite provides a good overview of the different assumptions and scaling laws for radio wireless networks .",
    "the underwater acoustic channel is characterized by a path loss that depends not only on the transmission distance , but also on the signal frequency @xcite .",
    "signals transmitted over a distance @xmath0 are subject to a power loss of @xmath1 . although a terrestrial radio channel can be modeled similarly , the underwater acoustic channel has different characteristics .",
    "the spreading factor @xmath2 , related to the geometry of propagation , has values in the range @xmath3 , where @xmath8 corresponds to cylindrical spreading .",

    "existing capacity scaling laws for wireless radio networks correspond to scenarios for which @xmath5 , or a constant greater than one , and @xmath6 , e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results can not be directly applied to underwater acoustic networks in which the attenuation varies over the system bandwidth and @xmath9 .",

    "in particular , we study the case of arbitrarily deployed networks in a disk of unit area , and follow a similar procedure as in @xcite to derive an upper bound on capacity . in this sense",

    "the throughput decreases very slowly as @xmath7 increases . for large @xmath7",

    "thus for large enough @xmath7 , the throughput decreases more rapidly in underwater networks than in typical radio channels , because of the difference in the path loss exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the underwater channel model . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the scaling laws for the case of a network transmitting in an arbitrarily chosen narrow band . in section iv",
    ", we study scaling laws for the low - power / narrow - band case , with optimal bandwidth allocation using a waterfilling argument . in section",
    "v , we consider the case in which the nodes can transmit at high power over a wide transmission band . conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "an underwater acoustic channel is characterized by an attenuation that depends on the distance _",
    "l _ and the signal frequency _",
    "f _ as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a reference distance ( typically 1 m ) .",
    "a common empirical model used for the absorption @xmath4 is thorp s formula @xcite which captures the dependence on the frequency .",
    "this absorption @xmath4 is an increasing function of @xmath15 .",
    "the spreading factor describes the geometry of propagation and is typically @xmath16 , e.g. @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to cylindrical and spherical spreading , respectively .",
    "the noise in an acoustic channel can be modeled through four basic sources : turbulence , thermal noise , shipping , and waves .",
    "it has a power spectral density ( psd ) which depends on the frequency , the shipping activity @xmath19 , and the wind speed @xmath20 in m / s @xcite .",
    "the complete model for a colored gaussian underwater link was presented in @xcite where power was allocated through waterfilling . in the absence of multipath and channel fading , the relationship among capacity , transmission power , and optimal transmission band of a point - to - point link is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the psd of the noise , @xmath23 is the optimum band of operation and @xmath24 is a constant . the transmission power associated with a particular choice of @xmath25",
    "is given by @xmath26 where the psd of the signal is @xmath27 .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the underwater acoustic channel is the dependence of the optimal transmission band on the link distance @xcite .",
    "1 illustrates the optimal center frequency @xmath28 as a function of distance .",
    "the optimal center frequency is defined as the frequency at which @xmath29 is minimal .",
    "this implies that if the transmission power for a link is low , the transmission bandwidth will be low and around the optimal frequency .",
    "thus , the optimal transmission band in the spectrum changes dramatically with the link distance .",
    "[ distance_band.tag ] also illustrates that a node transmitting over a short range will optimally be assigned a transmission band at high center frequency , as in case ( a ) , while a node transmitting over a longer distance will be assigned a different transmission band at lower center frequency , as in case ( b ) .        for the case",
    "in which power available for transmission is low , the bandwidth of the transmission band will also be small . when the bandwidth is low enough @xmath30 , such that the product @xmath29 does not change much over that band",
    ", one can make a taylor series approximation around the center frequency @xmath28 .",
    "this allows us to determine the power @xmath31 for which the transmission band is narrow due to our waterfilling argument .",
    "the taylor series approximation has the form @xmath32 @xmath33 in the band , where @xmath34 . substituting the expression   into expression  , and using the fact that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the maximum and minimum frequencies of the transmission band , we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "considering @xmath40 and @xmath41 given our quadratic taylor series approximation of @xmath29 , the above expression reduces to @xmath42",
    "let us study the physical model @xcite to obtain an upper bound to transport capacity for transmissions in a arbitrarily chosen narrow band in an underwater channel .",
    "the narrow band assumption allows us to consider the attenuation as a constant over that band .",
    "we assume that the nodes are arbitrarily deployed in a disk of unit area as in @xcite , that each node has an intended destination node , and that the requirement for successful reception at node @xmath43 of a transmission from node @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the position of node @xmath44 , @xmath47 is the position of node @xmath43 to which @xmath44 is transmitting , and @xmath48 is the set of all nodes transmitting simultaneously in the same transmission sub - band and time slot .",
    "we assume that all sub - bands are in the narrow band @xcite , so that the attenuation is only dependent on the central frequency of the narrow band .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is kept to keep in mind the frequency dependence , and to allow us to use these results in the following sections where we analyze more complex settings .",
    "we consider that @xmath49 is the throughput of each node , the network transports @xmath50 bits over @xmath51 seconds , and that the average distance between source and destination of a bit is @xmath52 . finally , we define the transport capacity as @xmath53 bits - meters per second @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath54 to be the transmission rate , where @xmath55 is the bandwidth of the narrow band chosen for transmission .",
    "since @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , then the path loss is @xmath58 using a similar procedure as in @xcite , we have that @xmath59 let us sum over all transmitters @xmath60 and use the definition of the path loss in expression  :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 .",
    "summing over all sub - bands and time slots and dividing both sides by @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 represents the @xmath66-th hop of a bit @xmath67 , and @xmath63 is defined as the number of hops performed in @xmath51 seconds , which can be bounded by @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 represents the distance between receiver and transmitter for the @xmath66-th hop of bit @xmath67 .",
    "since the function @xmath71 is increasing and convex for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , then @xmath75@xmath76 let us define @xmath77 , and note that @xmath78 .",
    "the left hand side of the above inequality is a lambert function of the form @xmath79 , which is an increasing function when @xmath80 .",
    "then ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the branch zero of the lambert function , using the nomenclature in @xcite . this fact implies that @xmath83    substituting for @xmath84 in , we obtain @xmath85 since @xmath86 is an increasing function for @xmath87 , and constant for @xmath88 , then @xmath89 .",
    "considering that @xmath82 is an increasing function , we have that @xmath90 using these inequalities into expression  , we obtain the scaling law : @xmath91 where @xmath92    since the zero - branch of the lambert function satisfies @xmath93 , then the exponential term @xmath94 has values between 0 and 1 .",
    "note that as @xmath95 , the exponential term in the scaling law goes to 1 .",
    "this implies that the exponential term is important to determine the scaling for @xmath7 small , while for large enough @xmath7 the upper bound is @xmath96 .",
    "if we consider @xmath5 , i.e. the same path loss model as in @xcite , and recall that @xmath97 , then @xmath98 which is the original result of @xcite .",
    "we have thus proved that the result in @xcite is valid for @xmath99 .     for an arbitrarily chosen narrow band and different values of @xmath4 .",
    "parameters used are @xmath100  1  bps , @xmath101  1 , @xmath102  2 , area = 1 km@xmath103.,width=336,height=336 ]    fig .",
    "[ upperbound.tag ] illustrates the upper bound on @xmath104 for different values of @xmath4 ranging from 1 to 10,000 , which are characteristic of an underwater environment at different frequencies .",
    "for example , @xmath105  1,000 corresponds to a frequency of around 100  khz .",
    "we have used @xmath106  1 and the parameters specified in the figure .",
    "we also plot dashed lines proportional to @xmath12 . as expected ,",
    "as @xmath7 is large enough the exponential term of the upper bound becomes negligible making the bound scale as @xmath107 .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath7 the bound starts at a common point for the different @xmath4 values , and decays very slowly . fig . [ upperbound.tag ] also illustrates that the value of @xmath4 determines the transition between these two operating regions : the larger @xmath4 , the greater @xmath7 has to be before transitioning .",
    "of course , if we use a transmission band with high @xmath4 each node will have to be able to transmit at higher power to reach its destination . in the underwater channel",
    ", it also means that a higher center frequency is required because @xmath4 is an increasing function .    finally , fig .",
    "[ upperbound.tag ] shows that @xmath104 remains almost constant for @xmath108 nodes , @xmath109 and a disk area of 1 km@xmath103 , which corresponds to densities of up to 100 nodes per km@xmath103 .",
    "note that the expected density of nodes in an underwater network is usually much lower given the applications for which they are deployed , e.g. environmental measurements .",
    "thus , @xmath104 is almost constant for practical purposes .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel is that the optimal transmission band using the waterfilling principle depends strongly on the distance of a link .",
    "in particular , if the transmission power of a node is very low , then nodes will optimally transmit in different bands corresponding to different transmission distances .",
    "thus , interference will come only from nodes transmitting in the same band .",
    "we have derived an expression for the power under these assumptions in section ii . in order to assign disjoint transmission bands",
    ", we divide the total transmission band of the system into non - overlapping bands of bandwidth @xmath110 .",
    "we use @xmath28 as the mapping between the transmission distance and the corresponding transmission band for a low - power / narrow - band scenario .",
    "thus , if a node transmits to another node at a distance @xmath0 , we assign the transmission band that contains the frequency @xmath28 as in fig .",
    "[ distance_band.tag ] .",
    "the capacity analysis is similar as before if @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath111 for each of the bands , where @xmath112 is the central frequency of transmission band @xmath113 .",
    "let us assume that each node is capable of transmitting at @xmath114  bps in each band , where @xmath115 , and @xmath55 is the bandwidth of each non - overlapping band .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath63 changes slightly when we allow multi - node hopping . in this case ,",
    "@xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the set of sub - bands used by the network , and @xmath118 .",
    "for each of the different bands , the analysis is as before up to equation  . at this point ,",
    "let us define @xmath119 as @xmath120 for band @xmath113 .",
    "let us sum over all sub - bands and time slots to obtain    @xmath121    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the set of time slots .",
    "we can use the fact that @xmath124 , where @xmath125 . in the uncerwater scenario , @xmath126 because @xmath4 is an increasing function . defining @xmath127 , and following similar steps that lead to eq .",
    "we get    @xmath128    defining @xmath129 , we can use a similar procedure as in the previous section , to show that the scaling law now becomes    @xmath130 where @xmath131    the scaling law is similar in structure to the one obtained in section iii .",
    "however , the constant @xmath132 depends on the average of a function of the absorption coefficients at @xmath133 instead of a particular value .",
    "again , if @xmath134 the result reduces to that of @xcite .",
    "if we constrain our system to perform direct transmissions only , using the fact that there is an assignment of frequency bands in terms of the distance , we can consider that @xmath135 , i.e. only one hop .",
    "given the distance - band separation , the problem can be thought of as solving for several networks that lie on top of each other , in different layers with no cross - layer interference .",
    "membership to the layers is based on the distance of the connection . in other words ,",
    "each transmission band @xmath113 will have @xmath136 transmitters , where @xmath137 constitutes the total number of nodes in the network since each transmitter has only one intended destination .",
    "this causes a different capacity scaling for each of the transmission bands , i.e. the scaling for each transmission band will have the form of expression   with @xmath114 instead of @xmath138 and @xmath139 instead of @xmath7 to obtain the scaling for band @xmath113 .",
    "in this scenario , nodes have enough power to transmit in a wide transmission band @xmath140 , which implies that the absorption can not be considered to be a constant over the band .",
    "the band @xmath140 is again chosen using a waterfilling argument .",
    "we consider that the sinr requirement can depend on the frequency .",
    "that is @xmath141    we define @xmath138 as the transmission data rate over the entire band , computed as @xmath142 if we assign a transmission rate to every sub - band @xmath143 of @xmath144 , the analysis for each frequency is similar as in section iv by letting @xmath145 , renaming @xmath55 as @xmath143 and replacing the sums by integrals .",
    "then , we have that @xmath146@xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath63 can be shown to have the bound @xmath149 using the definition of @xmath138 in expression  . following the procedure of section iv",
    ", we show that the scaling law for the high power - wide band case has the form @xmath150 where @xmath151",
    "this work presents upper bounds on the transport capacity of underwater acoustic networks with nodes deployed arbitrarily in a unit area disk .",
    "we study three cases of interest : an arbitrarily chosen narrow transmission band ; the case of power limited nodes which transmit in disjoint narrow bands ; and the case of nodes with high power capabilities that use of a wide transmission band .",
    "the choice of transmission band in the last two cases depends on the transmission distance and the physical characteristics of the channel , and is made in accordance with the waterfilling principle .",
    "we have shown that the amount of information that can be exchanged by each source - destination pair in an underwater acoustic network goes to zero as the number of nodes @xmath7 goes to infinity , at least at rate @xmath10 .",
    "this rule is valid for the different scenarios in general , requiring only changes in the scaling constants .",
    "the throughput per source - destination pair has two different regions . for small @xmath7 ,",
    "the throughput decreases very slowly as @xmath7 increases . for large @xmath7",
    ", it decreases as @xmath12 . considering that @xmath152 in an underwater channel",
    ", the available throughput for large @xmath7 decays more rapidly than in typical radio wireless networks .",
    "however , typical node densities in underwater correspond to the small @xmath7 regime . in a narrow band example with values of @xmath4 characteristic of an underwater channel",
    ", we showed that the upper bound on the throughput remains almost constant for densities of less than 100 nodes per km@xmath103 .",
    "most underwater networks have node densities in this range due to the applications for which they are deployed .",
    "finally , we have pointed out some important characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel useful in future studies .",
    "for example , we could allow cooperation between nodes _  la _ ozgur et al @xcite taking advantage of the distance - band separation .",
    "that is , instead of performing time division between long and short transmissions , we could simply transmit in different bands that do not interfere with one another .",
    "this is important because acoustic transmissions have long propagation delays due to the speed of sound underwater ( @xmath1531500 m / s ) , which reduces the usefulness of a time - division scheme .",
