    "since the discovery of @xmath0 , heavy quarkonium has provided an ideal laboratory to investigate the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "conventionally , people use the color - singlet model ( csm )  @xcite to describe the production and decay of heavy quarkonium . in order to overcome the theoretical difficulties related to the infrared divergences in the csm  @xcite and reconcile the large discrepancy between the tevatron data and the theoretical prediction given by the csm  @xcite , an effective theory ,",
    "the non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism was proposed  @xcite . in nrqcd",
    "the production and decay rates of heavy quarkonium are factorized into the short distance parts and the long distance parts , and because the contributions of high fock states are taken into account , the intermediate @xmath5 pair that is produced in the short distance part can be in various states with different angular momenta and different colors . by introducing the color - octet mechanism ( com ) in nrqcd",
    ", one may resolve the problem of infrared divergences in the csm  @xcite and may hope to give a proper interpretation for the transverse momentum @xmath2 distribution of @xmath0 production at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "more detail descriptions on many aspects of heavy quarkonium physics can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath0 has been investigated by many authors  @xcite . in 2001",
    "the delphi collaboration gave the measurement on inclusive photoproduction of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis indicates that the @xmath2 distribution predicted in the csm is an order of magnitude smaller than the experimental result and the nrqcd prediction can give a good account for it by the com  @xcite .",
    "it has been reviewed as a strong support to the com in nrqcd .",
    "the color evaporation model and the @xmath6 factorization formulism were also used to investigate this process  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the processes @xmath7 + g$ ] and @xmath8 + \\gamma$ ] are accomplished in  @xcite and the authors also give theoretical predictions for these processes at the tesla .",
    "recently , a number of studies show the importance of the heavy quark pair associated @xmath0 production in the csm .",
    "the contributions from @xmath9 final states in @xmath0 inclusive production have been discussed by many authors at @xmath10 factories  @xcite and lep  @xcite , and at the tevatron and lhc  @xcite , and even been studied in the @xmath6 factorization formalism  @xcite .",
    "although it is a nlo process , the @xmath2 distribution can be changed and the differential cross section can be enhanced at large @xmath2 due to the different kinematics of the feynman diagrams . at @xmath10 factories ,",
    "the @xmath11 process gives more than half contribution to the total cross section of the @xmath0 inclusive production  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , the authors study the process @xmath12 and find that the nlo process gives more contribution compared with that of the leading - order ( lo ) process @xmath13 at the lep . in the large @xmath2 region ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath12 is bigger than that of the fragmentation process @xmath14 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the process @xmath15 was studied in the @xmath6 factorization formalism .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate all the subprocesses of the photoproduction of @xmath0 associated with @xmath4 in the csm .",
    "firstly , the full results including contributions from all the single and double resolved photon processes of the @xmath0 production associated with heavy quark - antiquark pair at the lep will be presented for the first time .",
    "secondly , these processes will be extended to the photon colliders and the results with different photon production mechanisms will be given .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give definitions of some relevant quantities and derive the analytical formulas of the differential cross sections for all the subprocesses .",
    "numerical results are given in section iii .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section iv .",
    "there are three classes of subprocesses for @xmath16 : as shown in eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) , the direct process , where the two photons directly couple to the final heavy quarks ; in eq .",
    "( [ one - resolved ] ) , the single - resolved process , where one photon fluctuates to a parton ( here , the gluon ) and collide with the other photon to produce the final states ; in eq .",
    "( [ double - resolved ] ) , the double - resolved processes , where both the two photons fluctuate to partons to produce the final states .",
    "so in order to investigate the process thoroughly , the following four subprocesses must be calculated : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    .",
    "the others can be obtained by reversing the fermion lines.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    .",
    "the others can be obtained by reversing the fermion lines.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the four subprocesses involve 20 , 30 , 42 , 7 feynman diagrams , respectively .",
    "fig.[fig : gagdiagram ] and [ fig : qqdiagram ] just show the feynman diagrams of the processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the feynman diagrams of the other two subprocesses are as same as those given in the ref .",
    "@xcite . following the color - singlet factorization formalism and the standard covariant projection method  @xcite , the scattering amplitudes of these subprocesses can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the color - su(3 ) , spin - su(2 ) , and orbital angular momentum clebsch - gordan coefficients respectively for @xmath4 pairs projecting out appropriate quantum numbers of the bound states .",
    "the @xmath26 is the probability that describes a heavy quark - antiquark pair having the appropriate quantum numbers to evolved into a corresponding meson and , for the @xmath0 here , can be related to the wave function at the origin @xmath27 or the color - singlet long distance matrix element @xmath28 as following @xmath29    as for @xmath0 production , the spin - triplet projection operator should be used , which is defined as @xmath30 at the same time , the color projection operator for the color - singlet state is given by    @xmath31    we use the feynarts  @xcite to generate the feynman diagrams and amplitudes in the feynman gauge , then insert the projection operators and use the feyncalc  @xcite to evaluate the square of the amplitudes . in calculating the subprocesses @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath33 is used for the polarization summation of the initial gluons and therefore the corresponding contribution of the ghost diagrams must be subtracted .",
    "the analytical results for every sbuprocesses are too tedious to be shown in this paper . in order to check the gauge invariance ,",
    "the polarization vector of one initial gluon ( photon ) is replaced by the corresponding momentum in the direct and single - resolved processes and the zero results are obtained at the level of squared matrix element analytically . to check the gauge invariance of the subprocess @xmath32 , we replace the polarization vector of one of the initial gluons by its momentum and use the physical polarization tensor @xmath34 for the polarization summation of the other gluon . then the square of the amplitude vanishes .",
    "otherwise , the ghost diagrams must be taken into consideration for checking the gauge invariance . here",
    "the physical polarization tensor @xmath34 is explicitly expressed as @xmath35 where k is the momentum of the gluon , @xmath36 is an arbitrary light - like four vector with @xmath37 . in the calculation , @xmath36 is set as the momentum of the other initial gluon conveniently .",
    "the differential cross section can be obtained by convoluting the parton level differential cross section with the photon density functions and the parton distribution functions of the photon .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the photon density function and @xmath40 is the parton distribution function of the photon . here the labels i and j denote the parton contents of the photon , such as gluon and the light quarks . in the direct photon process , the distribution function @xmath41 .    in the photon - photon collisions ,",
    "the initial photons can be generated by the bremsstrahlung or by the laser back scattering ( lbs ) from the @xmath42 collision .",
    "the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung photon can be described by the weizsacker - williams approximation ( wwa ) as following  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the the fine structure constant and @xmath46 is the electron mass .",
    "the definition of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angle between the momentum of the photon and the direction of the electron beam .",
    "this angle is taken as 32mrad at the lepii .",
    "on the other hand , the laser back scattering can generate more energetic and luminous photons .",
    "the spectrum of the lbs photon is expressed as  @xcite @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , @xmath52 , and the constant n is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the energy of electron beam , @xmath56 is the energy of the incident laser beam , @xmath50 is the angle between the laser and the electron beam .",
    "the energy of the lbs photon is restricted by the following equation @xmath57 telnov  @xcite argued that the optimal value of @xmath58 is 4.83 .",
    "gev.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the spectra of the lbs and wwa photons are very different . while the latter depends only on the center - of - mass energy , the former depends on the parameter @xmath58 also . by comparing the spectra of the wwa photon at @xmath59 gev to the one at @xmath60 tev",
    ", we clearly see that there is no qualitative difference between them and the numerical difference is less than @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we just show the comparison of the the spectra of wwa photon and that of the lbs photon at @xmath59 gev in the fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - pdf ] . and",
    "it can be seen that the distribution of the wwa photon is large at the small x region and tends to infinite at the end - point @xmath62 .",
    "on the contrary , the distribution of the lbs photon is moderate in the whole x region and get its maximum value at the largest x point .",
    "these two distributions can result in significant different results .",

    "the grs99  @xcite parton distribution function of photon is used and the running of @xmath68 is evaluated by the lo formula of grv98  @xcite .",
    "both the renormalization and factorization scales are fixed as @xmath69 .",
    "the numerical results are multiplied by a factor of 1.278 to include the feeddown contribution from the @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "distributions of differential cross sections of @xmath71 production in various subprocesses at the lepii .",
    "the solid , dashed , dotted and dash - dotted lines correspond to the subprocesses @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath32 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the experimental result of delphi is also presented@xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the differential cross sections @xmath75 for all the four subprocesses at the lepii are shown in fig.[fig : lepii ] . to obtain theoretical predictions , the parameters which are related to the lepii experimental conditions are chosen as @xmath76 gev , @xmath77 mrad and the rapidity cut @xmath78 .",
    "the constraint of center - of - mass energy for the two photons is @xmath79 gev@xcite . from fig.[fig : lepii ] , one can see that the direct photon subprocess is dominant at the lepii with the wwa photon .",
    "the contribution from the single - resolved subprocess is smaller than that of the direct one by an order or more in magnitude and the contributions from the double - resolved subprocesses are even smaller than that of the direct one by almost four orders in magnitude . in the @xmath2 region that we investigated , the contribution from the double - resolved gluon subprocess and quark - antiquark subprocess are of the same order in magnitude .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the future , the @xmath42 collider may run at @xmath59gev or even at @xmath60 tev , and the lbs photon collision may be realized .",
    "therefore , we also investigate the four subprocesses at @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 tev . for comparison , we give the theoretical results with both the wwa photon and lbs photon at these two center - of - mass energy . here",
    "we set the @xmath80 of ww approximation as 20mrad  @xcite and the @xmath58 of lbs photon as 4.83 , which determines the maximum photon energy fraction as 0.83  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the calculation for the lepii , here we do not use the constrain @xmath79 gev .",
    "fig.[fig : gamma - wwa ] and fig.[fig : gamma - lbs ] give the @xmath2 distributions of the differential cross sections at different center - of - mass energies with the lbs photon and wwa photon , respectively , at photon collider .",
    "for the wwa photon case , the direct photon production subprocess is always the dominant one .",
    "the contribution from the single - resolved process is less than that from the direct one , but larger than those from the double - resolved processes .",
    "however , in the case of the lbs photon , with the increase of the center - of - mass energy , the contributions from the single - resolved and the double - resolved gluon subprocesses are compatible with or even larger than that from the direct one .",
    "but the contribution from the quark - antiquark subprocess is much smaller than those from the other three subprocesses .",
    "gev@xmath81 . here",
    "x is the parton energy fraction.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig.[fig : grs99 ] shows the parton distributions of photon in the grs99 parametrization  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the gluon content is dominant in small x region and even divergent when x tends to zero .",
    "it is only in the large x region that the quark contents can be dominant .",
    "let us first consider the subprocesses with the lbs photons as initial states . when the @xmath2 of @xmath0 is lower or the @xmath3 becomes larger , the contributions from small x region partons are dominant . because the lbs photon spectrum function has no singularity at small x region , and at the same time the gluon distribution function of photon has a great enhancement at small x region , the single - resolved and double - resolved gluon subprocess can be dominant in the @xmath0 production with lower @xmath2 or larger @xmath3 .",
    "however , as for the subprocesses with the wwa photons as initial states , where both the photon spectrum function and the gluon distribution function of the photon have great enhancements at small x region , the single- and double - resolved subprocesses have no predominance compared with the direct one in all the region of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath82    table  [ tab : sigma ] . gives the integrated cross sections of every subprocesses of the photoproduction of @xmath0 associated with @xmath4 pair .",
    "from the numerical results , it can be seen that the total contributions from the resolved ( including single and double resolved ) subprocesses are smaller than that of direct one by about an order in magnitude in the case of wwa photons . on the contrary , in the case of lbs photons",
    "the total contributions from the resolved subprocesses are larger than that from the direct one for by a factor of 2.5 at @xmath59 gev and 9 at @xmath83 gev .",
    "it can also be inferred from the @xmath2 distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lepii ] ,  [ fig : gamma - wwa ] and [ fig : gamma - lbs ] . at the same time",
    ", all the integrated cross sections increase with the increase of @xmath3 for the processes initiated by the wwa photons . and",
    "in the case of lbs photons , only the cross section of the subprocess @xmath84 increased with @xmath3 enhanced from 500gev to 1tev .    for the direct photon subprocess ,",
    "our numerical result is a little different from the one in ref .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the contributions from the single - resolved and double - resolved processes are much less than that from the direct one at the lepii .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have given the results of the nlo qcd corrections for the subprocesses @xmath13 and @xmath85+g$ ] at the tesla .",
    "for the subprocess @xmath86 , the @xmath87 factor is smaller than one . and",
    "the qcd correction for the color - octet subprocess @xmath85+g$ ] can enhanced the differential cross section significantly in the large @xmath2 region . from the above nlo results at the tesla",
    ", one can expect that the nlo corrections to the color - singlet subprocess @xmath13 could not enhance the result largely at the lepii also .",
    "so the contributions from the color - octet mechanism can not be excluded in the inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction at the lepii .",
    "the full investigation on the nlo qcd radiative corrections on the direct and resolved subprocesses may help us to clarify the situation .",
    "as for the photon collider with lbs initial photons , the contributions from the single- and double - resolved photon subprocesses become large significantly at lower and moderate @xmath2 region with large @xmath3 .",
    "this feature comes from the small x behavior of the gluon content distribution function of the photon , and can be checked in the future .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the production of @xmath0 associated with a @xmath88 pair in the csm in photon - photon collisions , including the direct , single - resolved and double - resolved subprocesses .",
    "the formulas for the cross sections of the four subprocesses are obtained in the collinear factorization formulism . moreover ,",
    "the results of the single - resolved subprocess are given for the first time .",
    "the numerical results show that the contributions from color - octet processes can not be excluded at present with the lep experiment .    at the photon collider with the lbs initial photons",
    ", the single - resolved and even the double - resolved processes will dominate over the direct one in the small and moderate @xmath2 regions . by measuring the final state @xmath0 and @xmath4 pair",
    ", the process @xmath89 can be separated from the inclusive @xmath0 production and could provide a channel to probe the parton contents of the photon .",
