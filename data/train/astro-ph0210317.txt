    "the scaling relations between the basic parameters of spiral galaxies  luminosity @xmath3 , maximum rotation velocity @xmath4 and scalelength @xmath5  are correlated via a two  dimensional plane which is similiar to the well - known fundamental plane for ellipticals ( e.g. , ) .",
    "most famous among the projections of this plane is the tully  fisher relation ( tfr ) between @xmath4 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a study of such scaling relations over different cosmic epochs offers powerful tests of different aspects of the hierarchical merging scenario and stellar population models .",
    "nevertheless , spectroscopy of galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath6 with sufficient ( spectral and spatial ) resolution and s / n for gaining robust information on their kinematics is a great observational challenge and has become feasible just within the last few years with 10m - class telescopes .",
    "additionally , any selection on emission line strength or disk size is likely to introduce biases in the results . to avoid this , we selected our targets purely on apparent magnitude @xmath7 and inclination @xmath8 .",
    "our source was the fdf photometric redshifts catalogue ( , ) . throughout this article",
    ", we assume the concordance cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "we derived rotation curves ( rcs ) by applying gaussian fits row by row to the usable emission lines in our spectra .",
    "after the rejection of disturbed or `` solid - body '' rcs , the final sample consisted of 78 spirals at a median redshift of 0.45 .",
    "to derive proper intrinsic rotation velocities , we performed simulations of the spectroscopy for each galaxy by generating synthetic velocity fields . with these , we corrected for observational effects like seeing , disk inclination , angle between slit and major axis , and also the optical `` beam smearing '' which originates from the comparable sizes of the slit width ( one arcsecond ) and the galaxies apparent radii .",
    "absolute @xmath2-band magnitudes were derived via synthetic photometry from observed @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , depending on the redshift , to keep the k - corrections small . for a more detailed description and a data table of our spiral sample , see .",
    "the final @xmath2-band tfr is shown in figure 1 . only rcs which show a region of constant rotation velocity ( due to the dark matter halo )",
    "were used for the bootstrap fit to our sample . in comparison to the local sample of , which comprises @xmath161200 spirals ,",
    "we find 2@xmath17@xmath18 evidence for a change of the tfr slope at intermediate redshift .",
    "this may be caused by a mass  dependent luminosity evolution which is stronger for lower mass systems , possibly combined with an additional population of blue , low ",
    "mass galaxies which is underrepresented in the local universe .",
    "as early  type spirals have , on the mean , higher maximum rotation velocities than late  type spirals , our result offers an explanation for the discrepant results of earlier studies , which were limited to small number statistics and mostly biased towards certain sub  types like low  mass systems with blue colors ( e.g. , ) or , in contrast , luminous early  type spirals due to the selection upon large scalelengths @xcite .    in figure 2",
    "we show the velocity  size diagram of our sample .",
    "the slightly decreased disk sizes of the fdf spirals are in good agreement with the predictions of the hierarchical merging scenario following , though the scatter is relatively large since the imaging is ground  based yet .",
    "we will improve the accuracy of the measured scalelengths and inclinations with hst - acs observations during cycle 11 .",
