    "double beta ( 2@xmath21 ) processes are nuclear transformations when the charge of nuclei changes by two units : @xmath22 .",
    "there are two main modes of 2@xmath21 decay : two neutrino mode ( @xmath23 ) when two neutrinos are emitted together with two beta particles , and neutrinoless mode ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 decay violates the lepton number by two units and therefore is forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath25 decay is predicted in some sm extensions where neutrino is expected to be a true neutral particle equivalent to its antiparticle ( majorana particle ) @xcite .",
    "experiments on neutrino oscillations already gave evidence for neutrino to be massive @xcite , however these experiments are sensitive only to the differences of squared masses of neutrinos .",
    "the observation of @xmath25 decay could resolve important problems of particle physics : what is the absolute scale of neutrino mass ? which neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal , inverted , or quasi - degenerate )",
    "is realized in nature ? is the neutrino majorana ( @xmath26 ) or dirac ( @xmath27 ) particle ? is the lepton number absolutely conserved ?",
    "additionally , investigations of neutrinoless double @xmath21 decay could test admixture of right - handed currents in electroweak interaction and existence of majorons symmetry , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the baryon and the lepton number , respectively .",
    "literature considers @xmath25 decay channels with one ( @xmath30 ) @xcite , two ( @xmath31 ) @xcite , and `` bulk '' ( @xmath32 ) @xcite majoron emissions . ] .    while @xmath33 decay is allowed in the sm , it is a second order process in perturbation theory characterized by extremely low probability",
    ". investigations of the @xmath33 decay examine theoretical calculations of the nuclear matrix elements , contributing to the development of theoretical description of @xmath25 decay .",
    "double beta decay experiments are concentrated mainly on @xmath34 processes with emission of two electrons ( @xmath20 )",
    ". two neutrino mode of @xmath20 decay was detected for 11 nuclides among 35 candidates ; corresponding half - lives are in the range of @xmath35  yr @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath36 transitions of @xmath37mo and @xmath38nd to the first @xmath39 excited states of daughter nuclei were observed too @xcite . to - date",
    "the @xmath36 decay is the rarest radioactive decay ever discovered .",
    "developments in the experimental techniques during last two decades lead to impressive improvement of sensitivity to the neutrinoless mode of 2@xmath40 decay up to the level of @xmath41  yr @xcite .",
    "moreover , some possible positive indication for @xmath42ge with @xmath43  yr has been mentioned in @xcite , and new experiments are in preparation both on @xmath42ge @xcite and other isotopes .",
    "a more modest sensitivity was reached in the experiments searching for @xmath34 processes with decreasing charge of nuclei : capture of two electrons from atomic shells ( 2@xmath18 ) , electron capture with positron emission ( @xmath19 ) , and double positron decay ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "there are 34 possible candidates for 2@xmath18 capture ; among them , only 22 and 6 nuclei can also decay through @xmath19 and @xmath44 channels , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath20 decay , even the allowed @xmath23 mode of 2@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath44 processes are still not detected in direct experiments capture in @xmath45ba with @xmath46  yr has been reported in geochemical studies @xcite . ] and the obtained half - life limits are much more modest .",
    "the most sensitive experiments have given limits on the 2@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath44 processes at the level of @xmath7  yr @xcite .",
    "reasons for such a situation are : 1 ) lower energy releases ( @xmath47 ) in comparison with those in @xmath20 decay , that results in lower probabilities of the processes ) ; the latter depends on energy release as @xmath48 for @xmath33 decay and @xmath49 for @xmath25 decay @xcite . ] , as well as provides difficulties to suppress background ; 2 ) usually lower natural abundances ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath44 isotopes ( which are typically lower than 5% with only a few exceptions , @xmath19 , and @xmath44 processes have natural abundances of more than 5% @xcite . ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , studies of 2@xmath18 and @xmath19 decays are important , because observation of neutrinoless mode of such process could help to distinguish between the mechanisms of neutrinoless @xmath34 decay ( is it due to non - zero neutrino mass or to the right - handed admixtures in weak interactions ) @xcite .",
    "zinc tungstate ( znwo@xmath0 ) scintillators contain four potentially @xmath34 active isotopes : @xmath3zn , @xmath4zn , @xmath5w , and @xmath6w ( see table  1 ) .",
    "it is worth to mention , @xmath3zn and @xmath6w have comparatively large natural abundance that allows to apply znwo@xmath0 detectors without high cost enriched isotopes .",
    "moreover , the @xmath36 decay of @xmath6w is expected to be strongly suppressed @xcite , that could provide favorable conditions to search for neutrinoless @xmath20 decays , including processes with emission of majoron(s ) which have broad energy spectra , somewhat similar to that of the two neutrino mode .",
    "the @xmath5w isotope is also an interesting @xmath34 nuclide because , in case of the capture of two electrons from the @xmath51 shell ( @xmath52  kev ) , the decay energy is rather small ( 13 @xmath53 4 )  kev .",
    "such a coincidence could give a resonant enhancement of the 0@xmath54 double electron capture to the corresponding level of the daughter nucleus @xcite .",

    "the presence of the peak with energy @xmath79 kev can be explained by internal contamination of the crystal by @xmath80pb .",

    "the measured efficiency ranges from about 55% at 15 kev up to about 95% at 30 kev ( one can compare these values with the detection efficiencies 30% at 15 kev and 65% at 30 kev obtained in @xcite ) .    to set a limit on the 2@xmath101 decay of @xmath3zn , taking into account the proximity of the energy threshold and the contribution from remaining pmt noise",
    ", we use a conservative requirement : the theoretical energy distribution should not exceed the experimental one in any energy interval , including error bars in the experimental values ( see fig .  4 ) . in this way",
    "the limit on the peak area is @xmath98 = 4665 counts . taking this value ( already corrected for the efficiency ) for the peak area ,",

    "this simple method allows to obtain a correct evaluation of the experimental sensitivity to the 2@xmath21 process searched for .",
    "it should be stressed that the detection efficiencies in all the distributions analyzed are at least 99.9% for all the processes .",
    "taking into account the efficiency of @xmath64(@xmath21 ) events selection by the pulse - shape discrimination ( 98% ) , the total detection efficiencies are at least 97.9% for all the 2@xmath21 processes searched for .",
    "let us give an example of the analysis by using the two approaches to search for electron capture with positron emission in @xmath3zn .",
    "14922 events were observed in the energy interval @xmath107 kev of the spectrum accumulated with an exposure 0.3487 kg @xmath2 yr ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , which gives @xmath98 = 122 counts . with the detection efficiency in the energy interval to the 2@xmath108 decay of @xmath3zn ( 82% ) , one obtains the half - life limit @xmath109  yr at 68% c.l . in order to apply the second approach , the starting and final energies of the fit were varied as @xmath110 kev and @xmath111 kev , respectively , with the step of 10 kev .",

    "different particles are emitted : x rays and auger electrons from deexcitations in atomic shells , @xmath64 quanta and/or conversion electrons from deexcitation of daughter nucleus .",
    "we suppose here that only one @xmath64 quantum is emitted in the nuclear deexcitation process ; it is the most pessimistic scenario from the point of view of registration of such an event in a peak of full absorption at the @xmath47 energy .",
    "unfortunately , 2@xmath51 , @xmath122 , 2@xmath29 ( and other ) modes are not energetically resolved in the high energy region due to finite energy resolution of the znwo@xmath0 detectors .",
    "so , the fit of the measured spectrum ( exposure 0.3647 kg @xmath2 yr ) in the energy interval @xmath123 kev ( @xmath113 = 98/89 = 1.1 ) gives the area of the @xmath121 effect searched for as ( @xmath124 ) counts .",
